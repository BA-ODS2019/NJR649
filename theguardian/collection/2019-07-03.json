      "bodyText": "George Osborne is considering putting his name forward to replace Christine Lagarde as the head of the International Monetary Fund, according to reports, a move that would see him become the first Briton to lead the Washington-based body. The former chancellor \u2013 and current Evening Standard editor \u2013 has told allies he would be well suited to succeed Lagarde, the Financial Times reported, after she was picked to lead the European Central Bank this week. Such a development would mark a dramatic return to a major public role for Osborne three years after he was unceremoniously sacked as chancellor in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, facing a barrage of criticism over a botched campaign to have the UK remain in the EU. It would also mark the first time in the 75-year history of the IMF that a Briton has led the global body, which acts as the lender of last resort to nations in financial distress. In the unwritten rules surrounding the formation of the Bretton Woods institution, a European has always held the top job, while an American has led the World Bank \u2013 its twin institution, which aims to encourage financial stability, international trade and sustainable economic growth. Osborne could face stiff competition from other highly qualified candidates at a time when Britain\u2019s place in the world has been coloured by internal disputes over leaving the EU, clouding the UK\u2019s international reputation. Other contenders may include Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, who was installed by Osborne. Although Canadian by birth, he holds Irish and UK citizenship. Carney is due to leave Threadneedle Street early next year. While Osborne\u2019s bid may be harmed by Brexit and by a reputation for unhelpfulness during the eurozone sovereign debt crisis, he reportedly told friends that his connections with the US and China, the two biggest world economies, may work in his favour. He may also hope for support from Boris Johnson, after throwing the weight of the Standard behind the former foreign secretary\u2019s campaign for prime minister. Osborne was criticised for doom-laden warnings over the economy made before the EU referendum, as well as for the imposition of a long period of austerity on Britain, which is viewed as being one of the key reasons that fuelled the Brexit vote.",

A further \u00a37bn a year should be spent to extend NHS-style free personal care to all by 2025, to be paid for out of general taxation.</p> <p>The chair of the cross-party committee, Lord Forsyth, said it was time for government to stop \u201cfaffing around\u201d and properly fund a system that was riddled with unfairness and left people enduring real suffering. \u201cOur recommendations will cost money, but social care should be a public spending priority,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The committee\u2019s report comes amid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/26/social-care-funding-crisis-putting-tens-of-thousands-at-risk\">growing concern</a> at the state of adult social care after a decade of austerity. The outgoing Tory chair of the Local Government Association, Lord Porter, recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/02/one-in-five-councils-face-drastic-spending-cuts-within-months\">warned</a> that vulnerable people would die as a result of the continuing failure to properly fund social care.</p> <p>Forsyth, a former Conservative government minister, told the Guardian the fairest and most efficient way to meet the \u00a315bn cost was via taxation. \u201cI\u2019m a Thatcherite Tory: I support reducing tax and controlling public expenditure. But this is the minimum requirement to provide a decent standard of care in our country.\u201d</p> <p>The committee said 1.4m older people were denied the care they needed as a result of cuts, means tests and rationing, while others received extremely basic \u201cclean and feed\u201d levels of care. Many as a result were housebound and unable to fulfil everyday tasks like washing or going to the toilet.</p> <p>With growing demographic pressures \u2013 by 2040 a quarter of the UK population will be over 65 and there will be thousands more working age adults with severe disabilities \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/06/age-uk-50000-elderly-have-died-waiting-for-social-care-package\"> social care funding reform</a> was an urgent priority, the committee said.</p> <p>At least 17 white papers, green papers and official reviews of social care funding have been published in the past 20 years, the committee estimates, none of which have led to meaningful reform. The latest promised government green paper has been <a href=\"https://www.carehome.co.uk/news/article.cfm/id/1603431/Brexit-sees-social-cares-green-paper-delayed-until-new-year\">delayed at least six times</a> over the last 18 months.</p> <p>The committee questioned the point of publishing yet another report. \u201cLet\u2019s not have a green paper,\u201d said Forsyth. \u201cIf you have to, have a white paper, and write a cheque to the local authorities. Let\u2019s stop faffing around and get on and do it.\u201d</p> <p>Politicians had been too quick to denigrate proposed changes as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/mar/30/death-tax-haunts-andy-burnham-care-revolution\">\u201cdeath tax\u201d</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/may/22/theresa-may-u-turn-on-dementia-tax-cap-social-care-conservative-manifesto\">\u201cdementia tax\u201d</a> to gain electoral advantage, thwarting reform, the report said, adding that there must be cross-party agreement on a way forward on adult social care and have an honest conversation with voters about how it is to be paid for.</p> <p>Social care surfaced in the Tory leadership contest when Jeremy Hunt \u2013 a former health and social care secretary \u2013 admitted cuts had gone too far. While Hunt and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/03/boris-johnson-cash-splurge-election-voters\">rival Boris Johnson have pledged tens of billions in public spending</a>, neither has mentioned social care. </p> <p>The committee\u2019s members include former Labour chancellor Lord Darling, former Tory chancellor Lord Lamont, former Treasury permanent secretary Lord Burns, ex-cabinet secretary Lord Turnbull and former Talk Talk boss Lady Harding.</p> <p>Free personal care was introduced for over-65\u2019s in Scotland in 2002, giving recipients help with daily tasks such as bathing, dressing, personal hygiene, going to the toilet, and meal preparation. Numbers of people receiving care doubled as a result, but it ultimately saved taxpayers\u2019 money by preventing costly hospital admissions.</p> <p>However, free personal care should not include the costs of accommodation, which would be met as now by the individual, the committee said, but government should explore introducing a cap on individuals\u2019 financial liability.</p> <p>Without <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/01/the-guardian-view-on-the-social-care-impasse-hurting-people-and-politics\">urgent action to address </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/01/the-guardian-view-on-the-social-care-impasse-hurting-people-and-politics\">social care funding</a>, much of the burden of caring for vulnerable individuals would continue to fall on family and friends. Most unpaid carers were women, the report said, with 63% of female carers aged between 50 and 64 caring for at least 50 hours a week.</p> <p>A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cWe have given local authorities access to up to \u00a33.9bn more dedicated funding for adult social care this year, and a further \u00a3410m is available for adults and children\u2019s services. We will set out our plans to reform the social care system at the earliest opportunity to ensure it is sustainable for the future.\u201d</p>",

A further \u00a37bn a year should be spent to extend NHS-style free personal care to all by 2025, to be paid for out of general taxation. The chair of the cross-party committee, Lord Forsyth, said it was time for government to stop \u201cfaffing around\u201d and properly fund a system that was riddled with unfairness and left people enduring real suffering. \u201cOur recommendations will cost money, but social care should be a public spending priority,\u201d he said. The committee\u2019s report comes amid growing concern at the state of adult social care after a decade of austerity. The outgoing Tory chair of the Local Government Association, Lord Porter, recently warned that vulnerable people would die as a result of the continuing failure to properly fund social care. Forsyth, a former Conservative government minister, told the Guardian the fairest and most efficient way to meet the \u00a315bn cost was via taxation. \u201cI\u2019m a Thatcherite Tory: I support reducing tax and controlling public expenditure. But this is the minimum requirement to provide a decent standard of care in our country.\u201d The committee said 1.4m older people were denied the care they needed as a result of cuts, means tests and rationing, while others received extremely basic \u201cclean and feed\u201d levels of care. Many as a result were housebound and unable to fulfil everyday tasks like washing or going to the toilet. With growing demographic pressures \u2013 by 2040 a quarter of the UK population will be over 65 and there will be thousands more working age adults with severe disabilities \u2013 social care funding reform was an urgent priority, the committee said. At least 17 white papers, green papers and official reviews of social care funding have been published in the past 20 years, the committee estimates, none of which have led to meaningful reform. The latest promised government green paper has been delayed at least six times over the last 18 months. The committee questioned the point of publishing yet another report. \u201cLet\u2019s not have a green paper,\u201d said Forsyth. \u201cIf you have to, have a white paper, and write a cheque to the local authorities. Let\u2019s stop faffing around and get on and do it.\u201d Politicians had been too quick to denigrate proposed changes as a \u201cdeath tax\u201d or a \u201cdementia tax\u201d to gain electoral advantage, thwarting reform, the report said, adding that there must be cross-party agreement on a way forward on adult social care and have an honest conversation with voters about how it is to be paid for. Social care surfaced in the Tory leadership contest when Jeremy Hunt \u2013 a former health and social care secretary \u2013 admitted cuts had gone too far. While Hunt and rival Boris Johnson have pledged tens of billions in public spending, neither has mentioned social care. The committee\u2019s members include former Labour chancellor Lord Darling, former Tory chancellor Lord Lamont, former Treasury permanent secretary Lord Burns, ex-cabinet secretary Lord Turnbull and former Talk Talk boss Lady Harding. Free personal care was introduced for over-65\u2019s in Scotland in 2002, giving recipients help with daily tasks such as bathing, dressing, personal hygiene, going to the toilet, and meal preparation. Numbers of people receiving care doubled as a result, but it ultimately saved taxpayers\u2019 money by preventing costly hospital admissions. However, free personal care should not include the costs of accommodation, which would be met as now by the individual, the committee said, but government should explore introducing a cap on individuals\u2019 financial liability. Without urgent action to address social care funding, much of the burden of caring for vulnerable individuals would continue to fall on family and friends. Most unpaid carers were women, the report said, with 63% of female carers aged between 50 and 64 caring for at least 50 hours a week. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cWe have given local authorities access to up to \u00a33.9bn more dedicated funding for adult social care this year, and a further \u00a3410m is available for adults and children\u2019s services. We will set out our plans to reform the social care system at the earliest opportunity to ensure it is sustainable for the future.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>New Manchester United signing Jackie Groenen ensured the Netherlands finally got the better of an excellent Hedvig Lindahl in the Swedish goal, in extra time, to set up a final between the reigning world champions, the USA, and the European champions.</p> <p>\u201cWell I just saw a nice angle and we\u2019ve been discussing it for a few weeks now about me taking more shots,\u201d said Groenen. \u201dThe ball came nicely and I thought I should just do it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t emotional at all after this game to be honest,\u201d said Netherlands manager Sarina Wiegman. \u201cIt might come later.

But in the 99th minute Groenen, whose form had been a concern going into the World Cup, beat Lindahl from 20 yards with a low strike.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/jul/03/netherlands-v-sweden-womens-world-cup-2019-semi-final-live\">Netherlands v Sweden: extra time in Women's World Cup semi-final \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The crowd were underwhelmed in the first half - the allegedly sold out stadium so patchy you could make out the \u2018Olympique Lyonnaise\u2019 in white seats across the top tier - and the play mirrored the lacklustre support. It was two evenly matched teams playing it safe.</p> <p>Lina Hunting came in for the suspended Fridolina Rolfo and Elin Rubensson remained in her starting position due to a late injury to Nathalie Bjorn in the warm-up, while a struggling Shanice van de Sanden was benched in favour of 22-year-old Bayern Munich forward Lineth Beerensteyn.</p> <p>Changes were minimal, contrasting heavily with the tactical chess from Phil Neville and Jill Ellis on Tuesday night. With the Dutch unable to carry out their usual orange march to the stadium, officials ruling out the 12-mile route from the centre on health and safety grounds, this was not the buzzing home-away-from-home that the Netherlands players had become a little accustomed to in the north.</p> <p>Sweden\u2019s first chance fell to Stina Blackstenius, who scored against Canada and Germany on the way to Lyon, Sofia Jakobsson slipped a neat pass to the Linkopings forward overlapping on the right but her shot was hesitant and straight at Sari Van Veenendaal.</p> <p>With creative hub Lieke Martens whipped off in favour of Jill Roord at half time - \u201cLieke, I don\u2019t know, she had a hard time, we\u2018ll see in the next couple of days [whether she will play in the final]\u201d said Wiegman - the Netherlands struggled to bring VivianneMiedema into play.</p> <p>A Dominique Bloodworth corner though, found the Dutch record goalscorer towards the far post but her powerful header was expertly nudged by the fingertips of Lindahl onto the bar.</p> <p>Van de Sanden received a raucous welcome when ushered into the fray with less than 20 minutes to play. And she immediately burst into life flying towards the Swedish box before earning a corner and thrusting her arms up and down trying to inspire some life into the limp match.</p> <p>In extra time though, it was Groenen that would prove the difference.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ae83d66935ae5f0451561a58310637f5571f3c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ae83d66935ae5f0451561a58310637f5571f3c0/0_0_2039_1359/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Netherlands\u2019 goalscorer Jackie Groenen (centre) celebrates after the final whistle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Netherlands\u2019 goalscorer Jackie Groenen (centre) celebrates after the final whistle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philippe Desmazes/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The midfielder, who has grown into this tournament, darted towards the box and picked the ball up at the end of a nicely passing move before powering low past Lindahl.</p> <p>\u201cThe feeling? Well, what can I say? A feeling of emptiness really,\u201d said Sweden manager Peter Gerhardsson. \u201cEveryone who has experienced it knows it. You\u2019re not angry, you\u2019re not sad, you\u2019re not disappointed. Empty, that\u2019s what I feel like right now.\u201d</p> <p>The Netherlands meet the USA back in this stadium on Sunday afternoon, while Sweden, who beat England 2-0 in November, meet the Lionesses in the third place play-off on Saturday in Nice.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about a medal and third is better than fourth so we\u2019ll do everything to win it. It\u2019s not a lot of time and we have to see if players who have played 120 minutes can play,\u201d said Gerhardsson. </p>",

      "bodyText": "New Manchester United signing Jackie Groenen ensured the Netherlands finally got the better of an excellent Hedvig Lindahl in the Swedish goal, in extra time, to set up a final between the reigning world champions, the USA, and the European champions. \u201cWell I just saw a nice angle and we\u2019ve been discussing it for a few weeks now about me taking more shots,\u201d said Groenen. \u201dThe ball came nicely and I thought I should just do it.\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t emotional at all after this game to be honest,\u201d said Netherlands manager Sarina Wiegman. \u201cIt might come later. I don\u2019t think it has sunk in yet.\u201d A dull 90 minutes, perhaps the dullest of the tournament, saw a grey game under a grey sky stumble towards extra time scoreless. Neither the Netherlands nor Sweden had looked likely to make the breakthrough in Lyon, instead the former Chelsea and Arsenal goalkeepers Lindahl and Sari Van Veenendaal, both let go by their WSL sides, were arguably the stars and firmly in the shop window. But in the 99th minute Groenen, whose form had been a concern going into the World Cup, beat Lindahl from 20 yards with a low strike. The crowd were underwhelmed in the first half - the allegedly sold out stadium so patchy you could make out the \u2018Olympique Lyonnaise\u2019 in white seats across the top tier - and the play mirrored the lacklustre support. It was two evenly matched teams playing it safe. Lina Hunting came in for the suspended Fridolina Rolfo and Elin Rubensson remained in her starting position due to a late injury to Nathalie Bjorn in the warm-up, while a struggling Shanice van de Sanden was benched in favour of 22-year-old Bayern Munich forward Lineth Beerensteyn. Changes were minimal, contrasting heavily with the tactical chess from Phil Neville and Jill Ellis on Tuesday night. With the Dutch unable to carry out their usual orange march to the stadium, officials ruling out the 12-mile route from the centre on health and safety grounds, this was not the buzzing home-away-from-home that the Netherlands players had become a little accustomed to in the north. Sweden\u2019s first chance fell to Stina Blackstenius, who scored against Canada and Germany on the way to Lyon, Sofia Jakobsson slipped a neat pass to the Linkopings forward overlapping on the right but her shot was hesitant and straight at Sari Van Veenendaal. With creative hub Lieke Martens whipped off in favour of Jill Roord at half time - \u201cLieke, I don\u2019t know, she had a hard time, we\u2018ll see in the next couple of days [whether she will play in the final]\u201d said Wiegman - the Netherlands struggled to bring VivianneMiedema into play. A Dominique Bloodworth corner though, found the Dutch record goalscorer towards the far post but her powerful header was expertly nudged by the fingertips of Lindahl onto the bar. Van de Sanden received a raucous welcome when ushered into the fray with less than 20 minutes to play. And she immediately burst into life flying towards the Swedish box before earning a corner and thrusting her arms up and down trying to inspire some life into the limp match. In extra time though, it was Groenen that would prove the difference. The midfielder, who has grown into this tournament, darted towards the box and picked the ball up at the end of a nicely passing move before powering low past Lindahl. \u201cThe feeling? Well, what can I say? A feeling of emptiness really,\u201d said Sweden manager Peter Gerhardsson. \u201cEveryone who has experienced it knows it. You\u2019re not angry, you\u2019re not sad, you\u2019re not disappointed. Empty, that\u2019s what I feel like right now.\u201d The Netherlands meet the USA back in this stadium on Sunday afternoon, while Sweden, who beat England 2-0 in November, meet the Lionesses in the third place play-off on Saturday in Nice. \u201cIt\u2019s about a medal and third is better than fourth so we\u2019ll do everything to win it. It\u2019s not a lot of time and we have to see if players who have played 120 minutes can play,\u201d said Gerhardsson.",

The Netherlands and Sweden came into this tournament without fanfare, ranked eighth and ninth in the world respectively, but here they are duelling to decide who takes on the United States in Sunday\u2019s World Cup final. Will it be Holland, who are appearing in this tournament for only the second time in their history but who are reigning European champions even if they have stuttered since gaining that crown? Or will it be Sweden, who are contesting their fourth World Cup semi-final, three years after reaching their first Olympic final? I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s what we\u2019re here to find out. It\u2019s on! </p> <p>Maybe the Americans would prefer to face Sweden, since they already beat them 2-0 in the group stages, although the Swedes were not at full strength then. That, as it happens, is the same score by which Holland beat Sweden when the countries last met \u2013 in 2017 \u2013 but the Swedes have improved since then under the management of Peter Gerhardsson and have also found a groove in the course of this tournament, following up their defeat by the US with deserved victories over Canada and Germany. But ace winger Fridolina Rolf\u00f6 picked up yellow cards in both those games so she is suspended for this one; that\u2019s a shame because her conniving with Stina Blackstenius was especially dangerous. The Dutch will still have to be way of Blackstenius, though, as well as a a powerful Swedish collective. </p> <p>The Dutch have hit a rhythm as they have advanced through this competition and they, too, have a couple of top-notch mischief-makers, as Lieke Martens and the prolific Vivianne Miedema work slickly together. But Martens has been suffering with toe trouble in the run-up to this game and if Holland are below their best, then Sweden might just spring another surprise. As we said: It\u2019s on!</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-03T19:18:49.683Z\">at 8.18pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Persistence paid off in the end for the Dutch. Their methodical passing was sloppy through the 90 minutes but they eventually found accuracy, possibly helped by Sweden tiring, and their goal came from a fluid move and a super finish by Groenen. They\u2019ll need to do a lot more of that, and a lot sooner, if they are to beat the US. The Netherlands reach the World Cup final for the first time! Groenen\u2019s superb goal sets up a Sunday showdown between the European champions and the United States! Sweden will face England on Saturday for the bronze medal. Et 30+5 min: Asllani is carried off on a stretcher to a warm ovation from the sympathetic crowd. ET 30 min: Play has not yet resumed following that miss by Van de Sanden, owing to an injury to Asllani. It\u2019s not clear what happened here, but she is treated by medics on the pitch and then helped on to a stretcher, seemingly in pain. ET 29 min: Van de Sanden is through on goal with a chance to seal the win! She pokes the ball with the outside of her boot ... way wide! Sweden still have a sliver of hope... ET 28 min: Seger strides out of defence and splits the Dutch defence with a splendid low pass. Jakobsson canters on to it down the left-hand channel. She has players in the box demanding a cross ... but another super sliding tackle by Van Lunteren prevents her from delivering one! ET 27 min: Sweden are piling on the pressure as they desperately seek an equaliser, but they can\u2019t find enough precision around the box. ET 26 min: Van de Donk booked for an ill-judged slide into Asllani on half-way. ET 25 min: Asllani sends in an outswinging corner from the right. Fischer can\u2019t get a clean header, and Van de Sanden is able to hook the ball upfield. ET 24 min: Sweden exert pressure ... until Glas is adjudged to have foul Van de Donk, whose smile suggests she\u2019s relieved with that decision. ET 22 min: The Netherlands flight a good freekick over from the right, Miedema laps high at the back post and nods just wide. Sweden substitutions: Larsson and Andersson on, Blackstenius and Erisson off. ET 20 min: Lindhal hoofs a mighty freekick into the Dutch area. It\u2019s hit and hope time from Sweden. But it\u2019ll take more than that to unlock this Dutch defence. ET 17 min: Roord lopes into the right-hand side of the box then pops over a low cross. It\u2019s sent back out to here, so this time she tries a shot. Sidenetting. ET 16 min: Asllani makes a beeline for the Dutch box, but as soon as she gets there she\u2019s forced back out by Bloodworth. After a well-balanced 90 minutes, the Dutch took charge in extra-time and were rewarded with a fine goal. But Sweden showed enough in the last two minutes to warn against getting comfortable just yet.. ET 14 min: Asllani goes down in the Dutch box and Swedish fans holler for a penalty. But it was an excellent tackle by Van Dongen. ET 12 min: No sign of that second wind yet, as the Dutch hog possession. The Swedes don\u2019t seem to have the energy to chase them so hard any more. ET 10 min: Now, can Sweden find a second wind and fight back? There\u2019s the breakthrough! It came a nice passing sequence, which Groenen joined by darting up from midfield to take the ball in her stride and crack a fine low shot into the net from 20 yards! ET 9 min: Asllani penalised yet again for a foul on half-way. ET 8 min: The Netherlands are starting to pen the tiring Sweden back now... ET 6 min: Van de Sanden charges into the right-hand side of the Swedish box, then chops back on to her left foot and hangs up a cross ... that drifts beyond two teammates. ET 5 min: Zigiotti is shown a yellow card for an overly rugged challenge on Van de Donk on half-way. ET 4 min: Groenen curls the ball into the box from the right. Lindhal comes off her line to push it off the head off Miedema. ET 2 min: Groenen slides the ball forward to Van de Sanden, bounding down the right. She sends over a well-intentioned cross, but no one can get on the end of it. ET 1 min: Sweden get things going again. The deadlock remains unbroken, so there\u2019ll be 30 energy-sapping minutes of extra-time. USA are the big winners here so far. 90+2 min: Van de Sanden fires a cross-shot from the right towards the far corner. Lindahl stretches out a hand to flick it behind for a corner! 90 min: The teams have at least five more minutes to find an unlikely winner ... 90 min: Van de Sanden does well on the right and then aims a clever low pass to Van de Donk, who miscontrols 15 yards from goal. 89 min: Blackstenius chests the ball down near half way and then turns and launches into a barnstorming run. She rollicks past three players before finally being stopped at the edge of the box! 87 min: A careless foul by Van de Donk gives Sweden a freekick in a dangerous location, to the right of the box. Eriksson goes for goal but curls it a yard over the bar. 85 min:Superb turn between two players by Jakobsson. But then she\u2019s dispossessed as she scampers towards the Dutch box. But Van de Donk gives the ball away - not for the first time - and Sweden threaten again, until Bloodworth cleans up. 84 min: Fischer comes to Sweden\u2019s rescue with a lovely tackle in the box. 80 min: Blackstenius wins a corner after a burst down down the right. Eriksson sends it towards the near post, where it\u2019s headed out for another. This time Eriksseon reverts to the tactic of planting it on top o the keeper. Good idea, because Van Veenendaal\u2019s punch is weak again. But Asllani skies a shot from 12 yards, thanks to pressure put on by Van de Sanden. 78 min: The Netherlands have been better in the last few minutes without achieving real fluency. Sweden substitutions: Zigiotti and Janogy on, Hurtig and Rubensson off. Will those changes have an effect that avoids extra-time? 74 min: Before the corner is taken, the ref sees fit to lecture the Dutch defence, presumably about holding. The corner is cleared and Van de Sanden collects the ball and romps into opposing territory. With the crowd cheering her on she reaches the box before it\u2019s put out for a corner. 73 min: Van Lunteren makes another trademark sliding tackle, this time prodding the ball off the feet of Asllani at the expense of a corner. Netherlands substitution: Van de Sanden on, Beerensteyn off. That\u2019s a popular one, judging by the huge cheers from the Dutch fans. 67 min: Asllani skins Spitse down the left and hurtles along the byline looking for someone to pick out. But no one shows, so she has to go for a hopeful cross into the danger zone. The keeper collects. 65 min: Excellent tackle in the area by Van Lunteren on Jakobsson. 63 min: Bloodworth strides forward for the first Dutch corner of the game. IT floats over her but lands on the head of Miedema, who sends it goalward from eight yards. Lindahl\u2019s gets a tiny but critical touch to push it on to the crossbar! 60 min: The ref doesn\u2019t appear to like the way Asllani goes into tackles. She\u2019s given a lot of freekicks against her. In fact, that goes for the whole Swedish midfield. Sweden have 15 fouls awarded against them, compared to just two for the Dutch. 58 min: Miedema has to drop back into her own half to get the ball. And when she gets it, she has little choice but to face her own goal and knock it backwards. 56 min: Blackstenius wins a corner on the right. Eriksson puts it right on top of the keeper again. It\u2019s punched weakly to the edge of the box and fired back into the danger zone! When it rebounds out to Fischer, she cracks a low effort from 12 yards towards the bottom corner ... but Van Veenendaal hurls herself to her right to make a tremendous finger-tip save, touching it on to the post! 54 min: Seger rolls the ball straight to Beerensteyn on half-way. The winger tries to get her skates on but can\u2019t find enough speed to get away from the backtracking defender. 53 min: Van de Donk plays a nice one-two with Miedema to bring the Dutch to within shooting range. Then she flips the ball over to Roord, who shunts it back across the D to Miedema, who tries to bring in a player arriving on the right, but overhits her pass. 51 min: Good pressing by the Netherlands, who win the ball just outside the Swedish box. But Fischer recovers well to nick it back. 49 min: Fischer overruns the ball on halfway and is relieved of the ball, but the Dutch fail to take the initiative - on the contrary, in fact, they knock the ball back into their own half from deep in Swedish territory. And they don\u2019t even do that accurately, so Sweden suddenly have a chance to punish them. But Bloodworth does brilliantly to block a shot by Blackstenius and then tidy up. 47 min: Van de Donk tries to drop a pass over the top o the Swedish defence into the path of Miedema, but she overhits it badly, as so often in the first half. 46 min: The Netherlands have been forced into a change - Martens\u2019 toe injury has flared up and she\u2019s been replaced by Roord. \u201cIf they\u2019ve been watching this and managing to stay awake, I imagine the fear and anxiety levels among the USA team is somewhere about the pi\u00f1a colada level, probably with a straw in it, an umbrella, frosting round the rim and lots of ice,\u201d parps Charles Antaki. \u201cAlternatively they\u2019re not watching it at all and are busy arranging doctors\u2019 notes to get them out of the White House invite.\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that was a super entertaining first half,\u201d reckons JR in Illinois. \u201cOn the bright side, at least the game hasn\u2019t been ruined by VAR. Yet.\u201d It\u2019s been a tense and scrappy semi-final so far. Sweden have been slightly the better and forced a couple of scary moments in the Dutch box. Lots of room for improvement, would be the positive spin to put on it. A place in the final is still up for grabs! 45 min: There will be at least three more minutes ... 43 min: Maybe a setpiece will provide the Netherland with a route to goal? No, as the freekick from the left is cleared. But the Dutch regain the ball and play their way back into the box nimbly. Fischer does well to block a shot from 12 yards by Beerenstyen. 41 min: More sloppiness by the Dutch allows Jakobbson to ease Van Dongen off the ball and allow Sweden to start building again. But then they, too, get sloppy. \u201cThe more interesting fact about Caroline Seger is that her surname means \u2018win\u2019 or \u2018victory\u2019 in Swedish,\u201d announces Taylor Sluggish, whose name means \u2018journalist\u2019 in English. 39 min: Spitse lets fly with a shot from long range but it doesn\u2019t bother the keeper. \u201cFor Arsenal Miedema is the shambling wreck who pays brilliantly in the box and scores tons,\u201d reckons Charles Antaki. \u201cMore of the shambling and less of the goals here so far.\u201d In fairness, the service to her so far has been way short of adequate. 37 min: Asllani lands a corner right on top of Van Veenendaan, who punches it out for another one. This one provokes mayhem in the Dutch box! Rubensson\u2019s shot from 14 yards is blocked, then Hurtig tries to stab it home from eight yards but Van Veenendaan reacts sharply to prod it away with her left foot! 35 min: \u201cDon\u2019t be so sure that the US wants to play Sweden again,\u201d quibbles Mary Waltz. \u201cAlthough the Netherlands have more individual quality they are similar to France and England, teams that they beat. Sweden is a disciplined physical squad that if they score first can bunker down, frustrate even the most talented teams, and strike on the counter.\u201d And they\u2019ve been slightly the better here so far, though, in truth, neither side has so far performed here in a way that would worry the US. 33 min: The Dutch have been patient and persistent when it comes to trying to play their passing style even though it\u2019s been breaking down quite a lot. Van der Gragt decides to introduce some variety with a more direct ball from back to front. But can\u2019t get to it before Miedema the centrebacks. 31 min: Miedema tries to slip a pass through to Martens near the edge o the Swedish box, but her intentions are read. Play is then halted so that Beerenstyen can receive treatment after a heavy collision. 29 min: Van de Donk gives the ball away sloppily; then Hurtig does likewise. Here\u2019s Jesper Haglund with a fun fact: \u201cIf Sweden reaches the final and Caroline Seger gets to play in it, that will be her 200th Sweden cap.\u201d And here\u2019s a fun fact of my own: if she plays in the third-placed playoff, that too would be her 200th cap. 26 min: Sweden play their way coolly out of defence ... before Van Lunteren dispossesses Dekker with a perfect sliding tackle. She certainly likes a physical challenge, does the Dutch defender. 24 min: Bloodworth makes another crucial interception, this time to stop a pass by Glas from finding the ever-lurking Blackstenius. 22 min: Another nice move by Sweden, who work the ball wide to Jakabsson on the right. She fizzes a low cross towards the edge f the six-yard box, where Bloodworth intervenes before Blackstenius can profit. 20 min: Van Lunteren curtails a break by Rubsensson with a hard and fair challenge by the touchline. 18 min: Eriksson curls over a dangerous freekick from near the right-hand corner flag. Van Venendaal does well to tip it out for a corner on the far side. When this one is delivered, Blackstenius is rumbled for a crafty foul. 15 min: It\u2019s very even now, the Dutch have found a groove. 13 min: Jakobsson strides through midfield and draws the last defender, then threads the ball through to Blackstenius, who runs into the right-hand side of the box and opens fire. But not with enough power to trouble Van Venendaal. The keeper is troubled, on the other hand, by Jakobsson\u2019s follow-up. But after a bit of treatment she declares herself fit enough to continue. 11 min: Sweden are forced into surrendering possession just outside the area, then Van de Donk slips a nice pass through to Miedema. She\u2019s about to shoot from 16 yards when Seger denies her with a superb sliding tackle. 10 min: Asllani\u2019s cross from the right sails beyond the far post. Van Lunteren should tidy up but doesn\u2019t, allowing Hurtig to nick the ball and dodge past her along the byline. He cross is fielded by the keeper, however. 8 min: Beerensteyn does well down the right, using both skill and strength to create room for a cross, which she delivers well. Sweden head it clear. 7 min: Sweden continue to apply the pressure. They\u2019re quicker to the ball and using it better when they get it, showing far more fluency. 5 min: Blackstenius lays the ball wide to the overlapping Eriksson, who spanks over a useful cross. But the keeper claims it well. 3 min: The Dutch catch out Sweden with a quick freekick, and suddenly Miedema spots an opening from the edge of the area. She fires off a decent shot, but wide of the target. 2 min: Sweden have passed the ball better in the opening minutes. The Dutch haven\u2019t yet found their range and have given possession away very easily a couple of times. 1 min: Netherlands v Sweden is go! Sweden win the toss and elect to kickoff. Here come the teams. The stadium in Lyon is rocking. Sweden are sporting dark blue jerseys and yellow shorts, while the Netherlands are as orange as they please. Nathalie Bjorn appears to have hurt herself during the warm-up. Her misfortune means a reprieve for Rubensson, who will start, after all. The Dutch team have come out to warm up. At least I\u2019m guessing they have because tens of thousands of orange-clad folk have just let out a huge roar. It\u2019s practically a home game for Holland - maybe that\u2019ll help them recapture their European Championship groove from two years ago, when they lifted the trophy as hosts. The BBC\u2019s pundits are still digesting the outcome of the first semi-final. Alex Scott reckons England lost because of the Americans\u2019 superior fitness, whereas Rachel Brown-Finnis says that was absolutely not a factor - \u201cit was all down to experience, how they managed the game\u201d. Phil Neville said that he thinks Sweden will prevail today, meaning England will face Holland in Saturday\u2019s third-place playoff. If he\u2019s right, then expect pained groans to be the soundtrack at the stadium in Lyon today, because there are far, far more Dutch fans than Swedes. The last time anywhere in France was so orange, The Cure got so excited they played a concert there. Seden have made two changes to the side that shocked Germany. Lina Hurtig replaces the suspended Rolfo, while Nathalie Bjorn comes into midfield instead of Elin Rubensson. Martens is fit enough to start for the Dutch, as expected, but Shanice Van de Sanden has paid the price for her disappointing performances in the tournament so far and been replaced by Lineth Beerensteyn. The Netherlands: Van Veenendaal; Van Lunteren, Bloodworth, Van der Gragt, Van Dongen; Groenen, Van de Donk, Spitse; Beerensteyn, Miedema, Martens Subs: Van Es, Dekker, Van de Sanden, Pelova, R Jansen, Kaagman, Kop, E Jansen, Kerkdijk, Roord, Van der Most, Geurts Sweden: Lindahl; Glas, Fischer, Sembrant, Eriksson; Rubensson, Asllani, Seger; Jakobsson, Blackstenius, Hurtig Subs: Andersson, Janogy, Falk, Ilstedt, Roddar, Zigiotti, Anvegard, Larsson, Musovic, Schough, Rubensson Referee: M Beaudouin (Canada) Hello and welcome to the clash of the in-your-face outsiders. The Netherlands and Sweden came into this tournament without fanfare, ranked eighth and ninth in the world respectively, but here they are duelling to decide who takes on the United States in Sunday\u2019s World Cup final. Will it be Holland, who are appearing in this tournament for only the second time in their history but who are reigning European champions even if they have stuttered since gaining that crown? Or will it be Sweden, who are contesting their fourth World Cup semi-final, three years after reaching their first Olympic final? I don\u2019t know, that\u2019s what we\u2019re here to find out. It\u2019s on! Maybe the Americans would prefer to face Sweden, since they already beat them 2-0 in the group stages, although the Swedes were not at full strength then. That, as it happens, is the same score by which Holland beat Sweden when the countries last met \u2013 in 2017 \u2013 but the Swedes have improved since then under the management of Peter Gerhardsson and have also found a groove in the course of this tournament, following up their defeat by the US with deserved victories over Canada and Germany. But ace winger Fridolina Rolf\u00f6 picked up yellow cards in both those games so she is suspended for this one; that\u2019s a shame because her conniving with Stina Blackstenius was especially dangerous. The Dutch will still have to be way of Blackstenius, though, as well as a a powerful Swedish collective. The Dutch have hit a rhythm as they have advanced through this competition and they, too, have a couple of top-notch mischief-makers, as Lieke Martens and the prolific Vivianne Miedema work slickly together. But Martens has been suffering with toe trouble in the run-up to this game and if Holland are below their best, then Sweden might just spring another surprise. As we said: It\u2019s on!",

I feel her loss all the time.\u201d At a family lunch, the big, loving, garrulous kind so many dream of, he comforts his daughter Hester as she weeps at the table. \u201cI\u2019m not in a good way,\u201d she admits. Then, in an interview to camera: \u201cI feel robbed \u2026 like this could have been intercepted.\u201d</p> <p>Could it, though? In never-before-seen footage, we see Anna at the international training academy of the YPJ, the all-female Kurdish militia she joined in northern Syria in 2017. Dressed in military fatigues, kneeling on a Persian rug, she looks fresh-faced, happy and exactly where she wants to be. \u201cI never thought I could be someone who could participate in the revolution here,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t regret it for a second.\u201d Less than a year later, she was killed by Turkish airstrikes in the besieged city of Afrin.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0006h6x\">Anna: The Woman Who Went To Fight Isis</a> (BBC Two), which was as restrained and respectful as you would hope a documentary on such a complex subject would be, Dirk tries to make sense of his daughter\u2019s death by reliving her life.</p> <p>He travels, as Anna did, from Iraq across the Tigris river into wartorn Syria, then north to Rojava, where she joined the YPJ, a western ally in the war against Isis. He meets some of the volunteers who continue to come from all over the world, for all sorts of reasons, to fight alongside Kurdish guerrillas. He sees where his daughter slept beside her Kalashnikov. He eats with her fellow revolutionaries. He reads her notebooks in which she recalls \u201cthe endless cans of Pepsi and AK-47s\u201d and how badly she wants to fight. Whether any of it helps becomes a moot point. \u201cThe more I know, the more I feel close to her,\u201d explains this gentle, thoughtful, magnanimous man who, like many grief-stricken people, is too hard on himself.</p> <p>In a lesser documentary, Anna may have remained a naive figure who died a futile death fighting someone else\u2019s war, which is often how she was portrayed by the media. Instead, a picture emerges of an emotional and committed activist, the type of child who defended a bumble bee being tormented in the playground by her classmates. \u201cThat was her soul\u2019s calling \u2026 to protect and nurture,\u201d Dirk says. She inherited her activism from her mother, Adrienne, who died in 2012 from breast cancer. This is a family felled by grief.</p> <p>Two days after her mother\u2019s death, Anna went to an anarchist book fair where there was a meeting about Rojava, then at the centre of the Kurdish fight for independence. Its objective \u2013 to establish a free feminist society \u2013 deeply affected her. By that time, Anna had dropped out of university and was a full-time activist engaged in direct action in anti-fascist and hunt saboteur movements.</p> <p>In May 2017, she announced that she was going to Rojava. \u201cI didn\u2019t question her,\u201d Dirk recalls. \u201cAll I could say was \u2026 it\u2019s been nice knowing you.\u201d He reflects on his own childhood, growing up with a mother who thought \u201cI would never amount to anything\u201d. How, after a school performance, she said to him: \u201cI was so embarrassed I felt sick.\u201d He swore he would do things differently with his own children. He would respect them, embrace them, let them make their own decisions.</p> <p>Back in Syria, Dirk meets Nesrin Abdullah, the YPJ senior commander who gave the order for Anna to go to Afrin. \u201cI was deeply affected by how honest, pure and clear she was,\u201d Abdullah says. She didn\u2019t want to send Anna to fight, but Anna started phoning every day. She dyed her hair black to look Kurdish.</p> <p>In a video recorded before leaving, she says: \u201cI\u2019m very happy and proud to be going to Afrin.\u201d \u201cIt was her choice,\u201d Dirk concludes. \u201cShe wanted to be the person she became.\u201d</p> <p>Back home, the morass of grief and guilt goes on. What is just as engulfing is the sense of Anna as an exceptional person and the equally exceptional family who continue to mourn her.</p> <p>\u201cHow could you willingly cause everyone you know so much pain?\u201d her sister Rose wonders. \u201cBut it\u2019s bigger than that. She\u2019s braver than that. The world has so much going on in it and it\u2019s bigger than our tiny pieces of grief.\u201d</p>",

And despite his recent crash Thomas insists he is primed for battle. \u201cI want to have that feeling again that I got last year: riding strong and racing well in the biggest bike race of them all,\u201d he says, the excitement evident in every syllable. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly going to be hard but I\u2019d love to repeat. That\u2019s what\u2019s motivated me from the start of the year. To get right for the crunch again.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Theresa May is warning her successor as prime minister about the grave responsibility of preserving the union, joining a growing chorus of senior Conservatives urging caution over a no-deal Brexit and the wider rise of populist policies. In a speech in Scotland on Thursday, May is to say that whoever takes over from her in Downing Street \u2013 most likely to be Boris Johnson \u2013 will have among their \u201cfirst and greatest\u201d duties a requirement to strengthen the unity of the UK. With No 10 holding open the possibility that May could vote against no deal as a backbencher, the justice secretary, David Gauke, a key member of a rearguard ministerial action against a likely Johnson government, warned on Wednesday that populist rhetoric risked undermining political stability. Johnson also faced a backlash over his plan to re-examine a levy on sugary drinks, with the former health minister who introduced the scheme, Steve Brine, condemning the comments as \u201ctransparent dog-whistle politics\u201d. In her speech, May was due to say: \u201cThe job of prime minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland brings with it privileges and responsibilities, which you only really feel once the black door closes behind you. One of the first and greatest is the duty you owe to strengthen the union.\u201d According to colleagues, May is worried about not only a no-deal Brexit prompting new moves for Scottish independence, but also the impact of such a departure on Northern Ireland. They say a visit she made to the Irish border was a pivotal moment in convincing her about the risks of leaving without an agreement. Following prime minister\u2019s questions, when May refused to be drawn about the possibility of no deal under Johnson or Jeremy Hunt, a Downing Street spokesman said she was \u201ctotally focused\u201d on serving as an MP for the remainder of the parliament. On her stance over a no-deal Brexit, the spokesman said: \u201cYou can expect her to examine any future proposals on their merits.\u201d And asked whether that meant the then ex-PM could vote against a no-deal plan, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not something I have discussed with her; but she has always been very clear about what she sees as the virtues of leaving in an orderly way, with a deal.\u201d In his speech to legal professionals at the Mansion House in London, which will be seen as a veiled warning to Johnson and other Brexiters, Gauke warned that \u201cthe forces of populism are much stronger in this country and internationally than has been the case for some time\u201d.

With Downing Street also mounting a strong defence of the sugar tax, Hunt said he was \u201ctotally confused\u201d about the apparent difference in views between Johnson and Hancock. In another blow for the idea, while Johnson\u2019s supporters talked up the removal of \u201cnanny state\u201d policies, Cancer Research UK said obesity now rivalled smoking as the leading cause of cancer. Brine, who oversaw the introduction of the sugary drink tax last year as public health minister, said it had been \u201ca \u201cremarkably successful piece of policy-making\u201d. Brine, now a backbench MP and a leading supporter of Hunt, told Sky News: \u201cThe sugar tax was paid for by manufacturers and they could either then add that to the cost of their products or they could reformulate. \u201cAnd guess what they decided to do?

      "bodyText": "The trial of Joshua Boyle, the former hostage of a Taliban-linked group in Afghanistan who was accused of violence against his wife, has resumed after the court ruled it would hear testimony about the couple\u2019s sexual history. Boyle was arrested at the couple\u2019s former Ottawa apartment on New Year\u2019s Eve 2017, just two months after he and Caitlan Coleman were released from five years of Taliban captivity. Boyle and Coleman had three children while in captivity. Boyle\u2019s trial began in March. He faces 19 charges, including sexual assault, assault, unlawful confinement and administering a noxious substance. But a delay in proceedings was triggered by questions of whether the court should hear testimony about Coleman\u2019s sexual history. In April, Ontario court judge Peter Doody ruled that he would allow defence lawyers to introduce evidence alleging Boyle and Coleman had previously engaged in acts of bondage and discipline (BSDM). Coleman\u2019s attorney appealed the decision on the basis of Canada\u2019s \u201crape shield\u201d law that prevents past sexual history from being presented as a way to establish consent or patterns of sexual behaviour. In June, an Ontario superior court judge allowed Boyle\u2019s defence to present the evidence. The trial was further delayed this month after the judge asked the crown and defence to consider whether a recent supreme court of Canada ruling on sexual history would impact Boyle\u2019s case. The supreme court recently ordered new trials in two cases where the rape shield laws were not upheld in court. Coleman\u2019s cross-examination continued on Wednesday. Coleman, who is an American citizen, is testifying via video link from the United States. According to the Canadian Press, defence attorney Lawrence Greenspon asked Coleman whether she had engaged in consensual sex or BDSM activities with Boyle after their return to Canada. She said they had, but that the encounters were not her idea. She called the BDSM acts \u201crevolting\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "An open-air heritage attraction praised for living, breathing and embodying the culture of Wales has been named the UK\u2019s museum of the year. St Fagans National Museum of History last year completed a \u00a330m redevelopment project and was rewarded on Wednesday for showing \u201cexceptional imagination, innovation and achievement\u201d. The artist Jeremy Deller announced that the heritage attraction near Cardiff had won the Art Fund museum of the year 2019 award at a ceremony at the Science Museum in London. It comes with a \u00a3100,000 prize, the largest art award in Britain. Stephen Deuchar, the director of the Art Fund and the chair of judges, said the museum had been transformed by a redevelopment project that had involved the participation of hundreds of thousands of visitors and volunteers. \u201cSt Fagans lives, breathes and embodies the culture and identity of Wales,\u201d he said. \u201cThis magical place was made by the people of Wales for people everywhere, and stands as one of the most welcoming and engaging museums anywhere in the UK.\u201d One of the 2019 judges, Bridget McConnell, the chief executive of the charity Glasgow Life, praised the devolved Welsh government for being such an enthusiastic supporter of St Fagans. \u201cEveryone I met and saw at St Fagans was in constant, lively conversation about their shared history, culture and lived experiences,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is their place, and it is strongly felt on every visit.\u201d St Fagans has more than 50 buildings that were moved to the site from locations around Wales allowing visitors to take a walk through Welsh history, from prehistoric times to the present day. It is the first Welsh winner of the museum of the year prize in its current form; the Big Pit National Coal Museum in Blaenavon won the Gulbenkian prize in 2005. St Fagans won from a shortlist that also included HMS Caroline in Belfast, the Nottingham Contemporary art gallery, the V&amp;A Dundee and the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, which displays the university\u2019s archaeological and anthropological collections. The museum, Wales\u2019s most visited heritage attraction, has been welcoming visitors since 1948 when it opened as the Welsh Folk Museum. The completion of the six-year revamp last year was the organisation\u2019s most ambitious project, creating new galleries, more learning spaces and a new building, Gweithdy \u2013 Welsh for \u201cworkshop\u201d \u2013 which is intended as a national centre for creativity and craft skills. It joins previous winners, which range from the enormous \u2013 the British Museum (2011) and the V&amp;A (2016) \u2013 to the considerably smaller, such as the William Morris Gallery (2013).",

The president will tout America\u2019s clean air and water, although his administration has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/03/trump-administration-roll-back-major-obama-era-environment-policies\">advanced many efforts</a> that experts say have undercut the country\u2019s environmental record. Trump has little to point to in terms of environmental achievements yet in an off-the-record conference call on Wednesday, the White House requested key supporting groups spread the message that the US under Trump continues to be an environmental leader. Critics are meanwhile savaging Trump\u2019s Independence Day jamboree. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/03/donald-trump-fourth-of-july-parade-speech-independence-day\">More than US$2.5m has reportedly been diverted</a> to pay for the military parade.</p> \n<p><strong>The not-for-profit aid sector has warned that Palladium,</strong><strong> is among a handful of powerful private contractors increasingly dominating Australia\u2019s foreign aid program</strong> in a way that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/04/palladium-aid-sector-concerned-about-rise-of-private-contractor-employing-julie-bishop\">undermines the national interest</a>.

Plants, they protest, are emphatically not conscious. US, British and German biologists have argued that practitioners of \u201cplant neurobiology\u201d have become carried away with the admittedly impressive abilities of plants to sense and react to their environments.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 4 July. Top stories Donald Trump plans to go on the offensive against criticism of his industry-friendly rollbacks of environment protections in a speech on Monday, according to three sources familiar with the plans. The president will tout America\u2019s clean air and water, although his administration has advanced many efforts that experts say have undercut the country\u2019s environmental record. Trump has little to point to in terms of environmental achievements yet in an off-the-record conference call on Wednesday, the White House requested key supporting groups spread the message that the US under Trump continues to be an environmental leader. Critics are meanwhile savaging Trump\u2019s Independence Day jamboree. More than US$2.5m has reportedly been diverted to pay for the military parade. The not-for-profit aid sector has warned that Palladium, is among a handful of powerful private contractors increasingly dominating Australia\u2019s foreign aid program in a way that undermines the national interest. Julie Bishop, the former foreign minister, announced on Tuesday she was joining the board of the private aid contractor, prompting immediate criticism from Labor. The Australian Council for International Development chief executive, Marc Purcell, said private aid contractors were concerned chiefly with profit and the job at hand, rather than pursuing Australia\u2019s broader national interest. The Australian Border Force has defended its detention of refugees for extended periods in a Brisbane hotel as \u201cappropriate\u201d, despite the government claiming earlier this year that such conditions were intended only for short-term and transit housing. Guardian Australia reported on Sunday that a cohort of refugees has been kept in the hotel, in dirty rooms and under heavy guard, for up to six months. Uncertainty remains about the long-term status of refugees in the hotel and several hundred others who have been transferred to Australia for medical treatment. Most have no visa status in Australia and remain in custody. World A volcano on the Italian island of Stromboli has erupted, killing a hiker. \u201cIt was like being in hell because of the rain of fire coming from the sky,\u201d Italian news agencies quoted a local priest, Giovanni Longo, as saying. The UN has called for an independent inquiry into the bombing of a Libyan migrant detention centre, which left at least 44 dead and more than 130 severely injured, describing the attack as \u201ca war crime and odious bloody carnage\u201d. Boris Johnson has sent an unsolicited email to his rival Jeremy Hunt seeking his support, which is possibly a breach of data protection rules. Johnson\u2019s campaign to become the Conservative leader is facing the threat of an inquiry into its use of data. Rahul Gandhi has announced his resignation as president of India\u2019s opposition Congress party in the wake of a catastrophic defeat in national elections in May. The man whose frozen body fell from plane London \u201ccould be Nairobi airport employee\u201d. The man\u2019s fingerprints are being analysed. Opinion and analysis A group of biologists is trying to bury the idea that plants are conscious. Frustrated by more than a decade of research which claims to reveal intentions, feelings and even consciousness in plants, more traditionally minded botanists have finally snapped. Plants, they protest, are emphatically not conscious. US, British and German biologists have argued that practitioners of \u201cplant neurobiology\u201d have become carried away with the admittedly impressive abilities of plants to sense and react to their environments. While plants may curl their leaves in response to touch, grow faster when competitors are near and spring traps when prey wanders into them, the vexed biologists argue that is no reason to believe they choose their actions, learn along the way or occasionally get hurt in the process. Empathy is more useful than fear in the fight for progress, writes the sociologist John Falzon. \u201cThere is a popular Chinese proverb that goes: \u2018The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second-best time is now.\u2019 It would have been great if neoliberalism had been defeated 20 years ago. It wasn\u2019t. Sections of the left found neoliberalism to be so nebulous, so difficult to pin down, that many even fell for its warped logic and were co-opted by it instead of fighting it \u2026 If Australians want the kind of society in which no one is left out or pushed out \u2026 we will need collectively to fight for them.\u201d Sport England have defeated New Zealand by 119 runs and thereby secured their semi-final slot at Edgbaston next Thursday, against either India or Australia. Fernando Verdasco has beat Kyle Edmund 4-6, 4-6, 7-6 (3), 6-3, 6-4 at Wimbledon. Verdasco looked resigned to his fate after an hour and a half, then cashed in on a steady decline to win in three hours and 43 minutes in front of a disbelieving audience on Centre Court. Heather Watson has tumbled out of the tournament as 20th seed Anett Kontaveit took command to clinch a 7-5, 6-1 win. Thinking time: Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s first six months Brazil was just weeks from last year\u2019s electoral earthquake when the rock legend Lob\u00e3o sat down outside his backyard studio, fired up his smartphone and announced he was backing the far-right frontrunner. \u201cI\u2019ve reached the conclusion I\u2019m going to vote for Jair Bolsonaro,\u201d the rocker declared in his YouTube endorsement. \u201cBolsonaro is the only chance of something new.\u201d On a recent afternoon, however, the gravel-voiced singer sank into a chair on the same terrace and admitted to a severe case of buyer\u2019s remorse. \u201cIt\u2019s a marmalade of madness,\u201d Lob\u00e3o grumbled of Bolsonaro\u2019s crisis-packed opening act in power which has been plagued by factional struggles, mass protests, claims of mafia ties and corruption involving his family, a cocaine smuggling scandal involving a presidential plane and damaging revelations involving his celebrity justice minister, S\u00e9rgio Moro.

The leading players in action today, including Novak Djokovic, Stan Wawrinka, Simona Halep, Karolina Pliskova, Kevin Anderson and Caroline Wozniacki, would be well advised to be on their guard as the second round gets under way - except perhaps Djokovic, because he\u2019s, well, Novak Djokovic. </p> <p>Refreshingly these lawns have not proved as hazardous for the British contingent. Of the 10 who started in the singles, seven are still standing. It\u2019s an excellent, encouraging return \u2013 and the best in 13 years. Two play again today: Kyle Edmund has the honour of being on Centre Court for the second consecutive match as he faces the bullish Spaniard Fernando Verdasco, while Heather Watson, after her restorative win in round one, opens on No 1 Court against the 20th seed, Anett Kontaveit. </p> <p>It seems somewhat remiss not to have mentioned Cori \u201cCoco\u201d Gauff until now, given she was the star of the show on Monday with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/01/cori-coco-gauff-beats-venus-williams-wimbledon-first-round\">her headline-grabbing story of the ages</a>. So can the 15-year-old, having eclipsed the the 39-year-old Venus only days after sitting a science exam, come back down to earth and refocus for her next assignment against the 2017 semi-finalist Magdalena Rybarikova? Given that the girl described as the potential future of US tennis displays a maturity far beyond her years, the signs are encouraging that she can avoid the sort of let-up that has often cut down Wimbledon giantkillers over the years. Rybarikova, however, is likely to provide a sterner challenge than Williams.</p> <p>Another player seemingly destined for greatness, the 18-year-old Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime who also secured his first grand slam match win on Monday, is in action too, while we\u2019ll also get to see if Yulia Putintseva, Jiri Vesely and Thomas Fabbiano can back up their victories over Osaka, Zverev and Tsitsipas respectively. Add Milos Raonic, Karen Khachanov, Feliciano Lopez, Daniil Medvedev, Victoria Azarenka, Elina Svitolina and Madison Keys into the mix, and that\u2019s your day three lineup. It may not be as strong as the other halves of the men\u2019s and women\u2019s draws but the scene is still set for a wonderful Wednesday at wonderful Wimbledon. </p> <p><strong>Play begins at</strong>: 11am BST on the outside courts and 1pm BST on the show courts. Don\u2019t be late.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08ec10d3a26f05f82efac157d635e304fa0ac1b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08ec10d3a26f05f82efac157d635e304fa0ac1b6/0_95_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wimbledon, under starters orders.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wimbledon, under starters orders.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-03T09:45:59.043Z\">at 10.45am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Right, that\u2019s it from me, dinnertime beckons on a winning Wednesday for Cori Gauff, Novak Djokovic, Simona Halep, Karolina Pliskova, Caroline Wozniacki, Victoria Azarenka, Kevin Anderson, Milos Raonic and Felix Auger-Aliassime, but a losing one for Kyle Edmund, Heather Watson and Stan Wawrinka. Thanks for your company today, let\u2019s do it all again tomorrow. Bye! Gauff, whose supreme confidence does not come across as arrogance, is asked about playing Caroline Wozniacki next. \u201cI think I can beat anyone,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t think I could win I wouldn\u2019t be on court.\u201d Rybarikova is serving to stay in the match at 5-3 down. She seems well-set to do so at 40-15, but Gauff comes back at her and it\u2019s deuce. Rybarikova rattles an ace down the middle, before flinging a forehand wide. It\u2019s deuce once more. And Rybarikova gifts Guaff a match point with a double fault! A lengthy exchange plays out... before Rybarikova nets! Gauff backs up that win over Venus Williams in some style, and while this result won\u2019t generate the headlines that her first-round win did, it was just as impressive. A nice touch from Rybarikova when Gauff slips on the grass at 30-all and the Slovak checks her opponent is OK. Gauff says she is, and despite losing the next two points and the game, seems to be moving freely. Gauff\u2019s is now the only singles match still in play after an impressive win for her fellow American Danielle Collins. The surprise Australian Open semi-finalist has taken out the 12th seed, Anastasija Sevastova, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3. And look here, there are more break points, with Gauff leading 15-40. Rybarikova shows some resolve to save both \u2013 before taking the next two points as well for a vital hold. The Slovak suddenly has a little spring in her step, and is pushing for her first break point at 30-all on Guaff\u2019s serve, but her effort then whistles wide. 40-30. Deuce. Advantage Gauff. Game Gauff. That was smart serving. It\u2019s 4-2. Gauff strengthens her grip on this match, rattling Rybarikova with another break for 6-3, 2-1. Which is very good news for my rumbling stomach. Rybarikova, giving no thought to my state of hunger, fights to deuce in the next game, but Gauff beats the Slovak up with a body serve before punching away another winner. It\u2019s 6-3, 3-1, and Gauff is making what was expected to be a tricky test look incredibly easy. While one American soars, another has slumped to defeat, with Madison Keys suffering a surprise 6-2, 6-4 exit at the hands of Polona Hercog, who now awaits the winner of Gauff v Rybarikova. Rybarikova holds, to at least ask a question of her inexperienced opponent. But serving for the first set is no problem for the 15-year-old. Gauff glides past the 2017 semi-finalist to love to wrap it up 6-3. She doesn\u2019t even celebrate; she\u2019s got her steely game face on and the job is only half-done. Gauff\u2019s won 93% of points on here first serve, has made only four unforced errors and has hit nearly twice as many winners as her opponent. Gauff consolidates the break for 5-2. And there I was thinking this would be a closer than it was against Williams. Rybarikova seems somewhat irked by the level of support for Gauff, and the noise under the roof is turned up a notch or two or three when Gauff gets to 0-15, 0-30, 0-40 on the Slovak\u2019s serve. Guaff breaks to love! Her dad is already jumping up and down in the players\u2019 box, just as he was in the first round, while her mentor Patrick Mouratoglou, the coach of Serena Williams, is also applauding. It\u2019s 4-2 to the young American. Gauff has such presence for a 15-year-old, she\u2019s walking around the court as if she\u2019s been playing on it for decades. She screams in delight when she whacks a winner for 40-30, it\u2019s called out but Hawk-Eye proves it was in, and Gauff then gallops forward to close out the game. 3-2. Having been typing away furiously for nearly 10 hours, I really quite fancy a bit of dinner, but that will have to wait, because Cori Gauff is up and running on the No 1 Court, where she seems to be suffering no hangover from that eye-catching win over Venus Williams. Gauff, who\u2019s the youngest player in the second round since Jennifer Capriati in 1991, holds twice and it\u2019s 2-2 against Magdalena Rybarikova. It would take a brave person to bet against Djokovic advancing from this easier half of the draw. He\u2019ll next play Hubert Hurkacz, the young Polish talent who he defeated for the loss of only eight games in the first round of the French Open. Djokovic declares himself \u201cpleased\u201d with the performance in the off-court interview, adding that his \u201cambitions are high\u201d and that Hurkacz \u201cwon\u2019t have anything to lose\u201d on Friday. Meanwhile the man Djokovic dominated in last year\u2019s final, Kevin Anderson, is also through, 6-4, 6-7 (5), 6-1, 6-4 against Janko Tipsarevic, sending down 23 aces in the process. Djokovic is preparing to say goodbye to Denis Kudla in three sets, leading 6-3, 6-2, 5-2 and serving at 40-30, match point. It\u2019s been short and sweet from the defending champion, who\u2019s played out some entertaining exchanges with the American. And there\u2019s another, as Kudla produces a passing winner. Kudla\u2019s grinning, as are the crowd. But there\u2019s a gasp when Djokovic gets another match point. This time Djokovic drives wide. Deuce. Advantage Djokovic, a third match point. Djokovic decides to take matters into his own hands by charging forward, but his effort at the net loops invitingly for Kudla, who whacks away the winner. Deuce. Followed by match point No 4. Kudla clunks into the net and that\u2019s that, Djokovic, the title favourite, charges on. It\u2019s been confirmed: Cori Gauff\u2019s match will now take place on the No 1 Court, where the luxury of the new roof means she\u2019ll be able to finish tonight under the lights if it gets too dark outside. It also means she\u2019ll return to the scene of her wonderful win over Venus Williams in the first round. This evening the 15-year-old phenomenon takes on Magdalena Rybarikova, who pulled off a result of her own on Monday, taking out the 10th seed, Aryna Sabalenka. Rybarikova is likely to be a tougher proposition than Williams who, despite her five Wimbledon titles, is nowhere near the player she once was. After a fatiguing first set, Wozniacki has come through a much more straightforward second, defeating Kudermetova 7-6 (5), 6-3. Grass is not the former world No 1\u2019s best surface, despite winning the girls\u2019 title here 13 years ago. She\u2019s never been beyond the fourth round, but in a light section of the draw, has an excellent chance of doing so this year. Djokovic, serving for the second set at 6-3, 5-2, decides to have a bit of fun when he strolls to the net and plays an outrageous shot between his legs ... which Kudla dinks away for the winner. That\u2019ll teach Novak. The Serb then gets serious with an ace to seal the set \u2013 before gaining an early break in the third. He clearly wants to get home for Today at Wimbledon. In other men\u2019s doubles news, Lleyton Hewitt, aged 195, is through to the second round, advancing in straight sets with his fellow Australian Jordan Thompson. As if we didn\u2019t love FAA enough already: Speaking of Novak, he\u2019s going along nicely in the second set, leading Kudla 6-3, 4-1. But, just as in the first set, it\u2019s almost too easy, perhaps he\u2019s a little bored, because there\u2019s a loose game from the defending champion and he\u2019s broken. Which will probably matter not one bit to the result of this match. Janko Tipsarevic, who\u2019s had no fewer than seven surgeries in the last few years, is having some treatment to a leg after conceding the third set to Anderson 6-1. And Felix Auger-Aliassime, the new kid on the block, is soaking in the applause on the No 3 Court, where he\u2019s come through in four sets against Corentin Moutet, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, 6-2, to reach the third round at the first of what promises to be many Wimbledons for the supremely talented 18-year-old with the Djokovic-esque backhand. Kyle Edmund has made his way into the press room and is refusing to blame that slip in the third set for his defeat, instead suggesting he didn\u2019t have the stamina to prevail in five sets: When I slipped my leg straightened, in that moment I felt something. I was able to play on. It was a long match, a physical match. I should have finished it at two sets to love and a break, but I physically tapered off. The [injury] didn\u2019t hold me back. I need to get physically stronger. Normal service is resumed on Centre Court: Djokovic takes the first set 6-3 despite winning only one of the last four games. Elsewhere Felix Auger-Aliassime leads once again, winning the third set to go 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 up against Corentin Moutet; Caroline Wozniacki, last year\u2019s Australian Open champion, has edged a competitive first set, taking it 7-5 in the tie-break against Veronika Kudermetova; and Kevin Anderson has decided to step things up a gear or two. Having taken nearly two hours for the first two sets, he\u2019s ripping through the third, leading 6-4, 6-7 (5), 4-1, with Cori Gauff to follow on the No 2 Court. Though if Wozniacki were to get things done in two sets, would Gauff be moved to No 1 to give her a better chance of finishing tonight? Kudla has his arms in the air, milking the applause, when he stems the flow with a hold to 15 in the next game. And Djokovic then promptly falls 0-40 down on serve! Maybe the Serb fancies a bit of early rope-a-dope with his opponent. He fends off the first break point with an ace, the second with a forehand winner but is unable to save the third. It\u2019s probably nothing more than a brief lapse in concentration from Djokovic, but Kudla and the crowd are smiling like the American\u2019s won the first set. Having previously worked with Boris Becker and Andre Agassi, Djokovic has another former Wimbledon champion in his coaching corner this tournament in Goran Ivanisevic, who looks on approvingly from the players\u2019 box as Djokovic drills through another game for 5-0. Edmund\u2019s demise means that Novak Djokovic\u2019s bid for a fifth Wimbledon title is back under way on Centre Court, where he\u2019s taking on the Ukrainian-born American Denis Kudla, who according to the Wimbledon programme \u201chas not been on such esteemed turf since being invited to meet President Obama at the Easter Egg Roll on the White House lawn six years ago\u201d. Kudla seems rather overawed by his surroundings and opponent, falling 4-0 down against the defending champion and world No 1 in the blink of an eye. So how\u2019s Verdasco feeling after that near-four hour, five-set victory? A little tired obviously. I was just trying to stay in the match, keep fighting. I was able to come back slowly, fighting, feeling better on the court with each set. I saw he was having problems with his knee and called the trainer, and I called the doctor because I had problems with my stomach. It was tough for both of us. In many matches you don\u2019t feel 100% but you just have to get through it. When I won the third set I was seeing the mountain a little bit shorter but obviously there was still a lot to do. I\u2019m pretty happy with my performance and know I will recover for my next one.\u201d Verdasco can get a little edgy, you know. But the 35-year-old isn\u2019t showing any mental frailty here, and secures three match points with a cross-court backhand winner that leaves Edmund lying flat on his face on the grass. Edmund isn\u2019t able to haul himself back up, as Verdasco promptly secures victory. From two sets and 3-0 up, Edmund is defeated, with his body once again letting him down. He\u2019s had a miserable time with injuries this year. There have been no more breaks since the third game of the fifth set, and it means that Verdasco leads 5-3 with Edmund needing to hold serve to stay in the Championships. Edmund shanks beyond the baseline for 15-all. He then feathers a backhand long for 15-30. Then it\u2019s Verdasco\u2019s turn to miscue, that was a little tight. 30-all. Edmund ekes out a game point at 40-30. And he takes it by pounding away the short ball, forcing Verdasco to serve this out. Corentin Moutet enjoys writing poetry in his spare time but he clearly hasn\u2019t read the script against the star in the making Felix Auger-Aliassime, taking the second set 6-4. Caroline Wozniacki, meanwhile, who\u2019s playing her first grand slam as a married woman, is just getting started against Russia\u2019s Veronika Kudermetova on the No 1 Court, and Kevin Anderson is a set to the good, 6-4, against Janko Tipsarevic on No 2. Verdasco backs up the break for 3-1. \u201cI just tried to stay there, I didn\u2019t start too well but Felli is always difficult on grass,\u201d says Khachanov, who\u2019s seeded 10th and could cause some real damage with his game of cannonfire. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find a rhythm then when I found some that turned the situation around. \u201cI think I played well in the last couple of years and have had some good results. I\u2019m feeling pretty comfortable, nothing to complain about and I\u2019m in the third round and feeling pretty good. I adapt to my next rival and try to get ready for it.\u201d That next rival will be Roberto Bautista Agut, who was two sets up when Belgium\u2019s Steve Darcis quit. That makes it three retirements for today, and could it be four? Edmund is barely moving as he\u2019s broken in the fifth set to slump 2-1 down. His knee may be throbbing, but this is proving nearly as painful to watch. It\u2019s been quite some denouement on the No 1 Court, where the Russian with the forehand that can strike fear into any opponent, Karen Khachanov, has blasted away a breathtaking winner in a final game lasting 13 minutes to defeat the Queen\u2019s champion, Feliciano Lopez, 4-6, 6-4, 7-5, 6-4. Meanwhile talking of Andy: An ailing Edmund, having done his best to hang in, drops serve at 4-3 in the fourth set when he doesn\u2019t even attempt to move to the ball. That\u2019s an extremely worrying sign for the rest of this match and it leaves Verdasco serving to level at two sets all. Will Edmund even make it to the end of a fifth? The way he\u2019s looking it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if he\u2019s forced to retire for the second consecutive slam. Verdasco sprints through his service game to love to take the set 6-3. Reilly Opelka has been facing the hacks after his win over Stan Wawrinka, and has faced such probing questions as how he squeezes his 6ft 11in frame into hotel beds. As for today\u2019s victory, he said: It\u2019s a huge win. More so the situation of the match being down two sets to one. Breakpoints the first game in the fourth set, and that\u2019s tough obviously. He easily could have walked away with that in four sets. But I\u2019m just proud of how I competed and how I handled the big moments of the match. Watching Edmund in this fourth set is unfortunately like watching Andy Murray pre-hip surgery, with the constant limping between points. That right knee is clearly still bothering Edmund, but he\u2019s still managed to retrieve a break for 2-2. Verdasco then edges ahead on serve for 3-2. It\u2019s hard to call this. Edmund has the two sets to one advantage, but he\u2019s holding on, and if Verdasco were to win this set you\u2019d fancy the Spaniard in the decider. Fancy getting in the mood for Nadal v Kyrgios tomorrow? Sure you do: Cori Gauff beware: Yulia Putintseva, who upset the world No 2, Naomi Osaka, has gone out in the second round, 6-4, 7-6 (3) to the 81st-ranked Viktorija Golubic. Gauff, meanwhile, is still waiting to get on to court. Venus Williams\u2019s conqueror will be on after Kevin Anderson, the beaten \u2013 or more accurately beaten up \u2013 finalist last year, takes on the former top-10er Janko Tipsarevic. They\u2019re only just under way on the No 2 Court, but Anderson has a break, leading 3-1. FAA is generating plenty of excitement on the No 3 Court. The Canadian wonderkid, who\u2019s ranked 21 in the world despite only securing his first grand slam match win on Monday, has taken the first set 6-3 against France\u2019s Corentin Moutet. Remarkably FAA is one of favourites with the bookies, outside of the Big Three, to win the title. And this is his first Wimbledon! It probably says as much about stranglehold of Djokovic, Federer and Nadal as it does about the 18-year-old\u2019s ability, which is quite breathtaking. Yes he will. Edmund\u2019s receiving treatment to his right knee, which he jarred after sliding to reach a backhand. At least it\u2019s not the same knee that caused his Roland Garros retirement. 4-2 soon becomes 5-2 which turns into 6-2, four set points. Mrs Verdasco is smiling in the stands. She\u2019s not quite so happy when Edmund lets out a bit of frustration with a raking cross-court winner. But the mountain is too high. Verdasco seizes on the second set point to take the tie-break 7-3 and Edmund limps to his chair, a worrying sign for the British No 1 who had to retire from the French Open last month with a knee injury. Will the trainer be called into action? It\u2019s tie-break time on Centre Court, where after all those early breaks in the third set both Edmund and Verdasco settled down for a few holds. The first three points of the breaker also go the way of the server, until Verdasco fires a forehand winner down the line for 3-1. Verdasco is still in possession of the mini-break as they change ends at 4-2 ... Having been taken to a third set, Halep is now hurtling towards the finish line on the No 2 Court, briefly inconvenienced at 5-2, 0-30 on Buzarnescu\u2019s serve when her opponent takes aim at the umpire after a disputed call. Buzarnescu\u2019s appeal is in vain, Halep has three match points, and she rounds things off with a superb winner to prevail in the battle of the Romanians, 6-3, 4-6, 6-2. The former world No 1 will next play another former world No 1, Victoria Azarenka, in what could be one of the highlights of the third round. Well, well. Edmund, having led 3-0 in the third set and potentially nine points from victory, has dropped serve to give Verdasco a glimmer at 3-2, which turns into 3-3. Meanwhile I\u2019m not sure what to make of tomorrow\u2019s order of play, with organisers putting two British players on Centre, Cameron Norrie and Johanna Konta, at the expense of another Brit, Jay Clarke \u2013 who plays none other than Roger Federer \u2013 and also the world No 1 Ashleigh Barty and defending champion Angelique Kerber, who\u2019ve been cast out to the No 2 Court. Wimbledon has been praised for putting more women\u2019s matches than men\u2019s on the show courts so far, but many will regard this as a step backwards. Canadian cyborg Milos Raonic has made the third round for the sixth consecutive year, serving up a straight-sets victory over Robin Haase, 7-6 (1), 7-5, 7-6 (4). He does love a tie-break or two. Meanwhile another Canadian, the top teenage talent Felix Auger-Aliassime who I may call FAA from now on for RSI-avoiding purposes, is in the very early stages against the qualifier and poetry-writing Frenchman Corentin Moutet. Sets have been split on the No 1 Court, where another veteran Spanish left-hander, Felicano Lopez, who won the doubles title with Andy Murray at Queen\u2019s last month as well as the singles, is 6-4, 4-6 against the explosive Russian youngster Karen Khachanov. It\u2019s a similar story on the No 2 Court, where Simona Halep won the first set 6-3 against her fellow Romanian Mihaela Buzarnescu but has conceded the second 6-4. \u201cThe McEnroe doc? The only tennis \u201cdoc\u201d you ever need to see is 7 Days in Hell!\u201d writes Antony Train. Meanwhile Verdasco is still in his own personal hell, surrendering serve with a double fault to give Edmund at 2-0 advantage at the beginning of the third set. Strange and sweary scenes on Centre Court, where the second set has gone the way of Edmund, 6-4. Verdasco had a brain freeze at the net on set point, leaving an Edmund shot he thought was going out but it landed on the line. Verdasco is furious with himself, and leaves the court briefly to perhaps punch a locker room wall or two, while Edmund is a set away from a place in the third round. Thomas Fabbiano, whose play got to the Greek in the first round when he took out Stefanos Tsitsipas, has come through a titanic tussle with Ivo Karlovic, winning his second successive five-setter, 6-3, 6-7 (6), 6-3, 6-7 (4), 6-4. The Italian was giving away a foot in height and 10 years in age to Karlovic, who at 40 is the oldest man to play singles at Wimbledon since Ken Rosewall in 1975. Here\u2019s the David v Goliath scene at the end: Two walloping winners, a net cord and a Verdasco error later, Edmund is back on serve after a fourth break in six second-set games. It\u2019s 3-3. Which soon becomes 4-4. There was a rumour doing the rounds on Twitter yesterday, Serge, but there was no truth in it. Wawrinka\u2019s just been in the press conference room, and was asked about the challenge of coming back here next year: You said in the past that you were quite keen to get all Grand Slam titles. You\u2019re going to be 35 coming to Wimbledon next year. Do you think it\u2019s a pipe dream now that you can hold this as well? SW: I never said I was ready to win Wimbledon. I said that was my goal. I come every year with the challenge to play the best I can. I play two times quarterfinal. If not, I lost first round, second round. I know how tough it is to win a Grand Slam. I\u2019m really happy with everything I\u2019ve achieved all my career by winning three Grand Slam in the same era of the big four. Yeah, today I\u2019m disappointed to have lost that match, but it is what it is. The umpire on Centre Court mumbles \u201cGame Edmund\u201d but it almost sounded like \u201cGame Henman\u201d, which had me confused for a brief moment. I think the reminiscing about Wimbledon years gone by has got to me. Edmund holds but is still a break down in the second set, 3-2. Not yet Gary \u2013 though I definitely will when I get a chance. And I keep on meaning to rewatch the excellent Strokes of Genius documentary, which the BBC screened before last year\u2019s Wimbledon. You wait until the last game of the first set between Edmund v Verdasco for a break, and then three come along at once in the second. Edmund trails 2-1. It\u2019s a disappointing let-up from the British No 1 given how strongly he finished that first set. Daniil Medvedev, who made a name for himself here for all the wrong reasons two years ago when he threw coins at the umpire\u2019s chair after losing, is through, bouncing back from losing the first set to defeat the Australian qualifier Alex Popyrin 6-7 (6), 6-1, 6-4, 6-4. The Russian 11th seed will next face Belgium\u2019s David Goffin, a straight-sets winner over France\u2019s Jeremy Chardy. Meanwhile Jiri Vesely has been riding the form that sent him past Alex Zverev in the first round, this time beating Uruguay\u2019s Pablo Cuevas in four sets. A report for your perusal: However to more important matters, because Edmund is cranking up the pressure on the Verdasco serve at just the right moment, with the Spaniard serving to stay in the first set at 5-4 down. This is a match between two of the biggest forehands in tennis and Edmund, suddenly striking the ball with much more purpose, brings up set point at his advantage. Edmund rips a cross-court forehand, many in the crowd are prematurely celebrating, but the left-handed Verdasco scrambles to get it back and an exasperated Edmund nets. The Brit regains his composure, though, and here\u2019s another set point, which Edmund takes! He leads 6-4. Simona Halep suffered an injury scare in the first round but raced out of the blocks today, breaking Mihaela Buzarnescu in the opening game of the all-Romanian affair on the No 2 Court. The former world No 1 and last year\u2019s French Open champion has since been pegged back, though, and it\u2019s 2-2. Buzarnescu may well look at Halep and wonder what might have been. The 31-year-old was an incredibly successful junior but injuries hit when she tried to make her mark on the seniors. She eventually decided to quit tennis, and gained a PhD in sports science in 2016. While playing tennis recreationally she realised her knee pain had almost disappeared and returned to the tour in 2017. I wonder if there are any other doctors currently playing professional tennis? Mikhail Youzhny springs to mind \u2013 he gained a PhD in philosophy in 2011 \u2013 but he retired last year. Even the GOAT can recognise potential greatness: Pliskova\u2019s pummelling of Puig means that Kyle Edmund, the British No 1 in the absence of Andy Murray, is now on Centre Court against the fiery Fernando Verdasco, who\u2019s competing in his 65th consecutive major, a record surpassed only by his fellow Spaniard Feliciano Lopez, who\u2019s just stepped on to the No 1 Court to play the rising Russian Karen Khachanov. After four holds of serve, Edmund is facing a break point at 2-2, and the 24-year-old from Yorkshire, not one to usually give much away on court, is rather animated. He gets even louder when he wins the next three points to hold. \u201cLET\u2019S GO,\u201d he screams to the crowd, who\u2019ll like that bit of emotion from a player you feel they\u2019ve yet to fully embrace. I return as Reilly Opelka becomes a giant giantkiller, the 6ft 11in, 21-year-old American taking out the three-times grand slam champion Stan Wawrinka over three hours and 13 minutes, 7-5, 3-6, 4-6, 6-4, 8-6. So we\u2019ll have to wait for Wimbledon\u2019s first final-set tie-break. It\u2019s Opelka\u2019s best grand slam result and means Wawrinka\u2019s bid to secure the only major title missing from his trophy cabinet will extend into another year. Thanks Michael. Yes I\u2019m feeling suitably refreshed, though unfortunately I didn\u2019t get to tuck into one of these: I\u2019m going to hand back to Katy now, who is back from her lunch. Enjoy the afternoon\u2019s play. Bye! Kontaveit is simply too good, and serves out the match with aplomb, a forehand winner down the line clipping the line. 7-5, 6-1 for the Estonian, who now speaks! The beginning was nervous from both of us. It\u2019s nice playing in front of a big crowd \u2013 who were obviously supporting her. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard Kontaveit speak before, but her accent is so English. As in, she sounds like she\u2019s from Kent, despite the fact that she is Tallinn born and has never lived in England. She recently explained why: When I was playing juniors, I had a lot of British friends. We skype sometimes too. It\u2019s not something I wanted to have, but I definitely picked it up and now I can\u2019t do anything about it. The world No 3, Karolina Pliskova, is in great form at the moment, fresh from winning on grass at Eastbourne, where she thrashed current Wimbledon champion, Angelique Kerber, 6-1, 6-4. She\u2019s wasted no time here either, seeing off Monica Puig 6-0, 6-4. Kontaveit is pulling away from Watson now, a set and 4-1 up in the second. This won\u2019t take long. Anyway, back to the tennis. We\u2019re on serve in the final set between Wawrinka and Opelka \u2013 4-5 \u2013 which means the Swiss is serving to stay in the match. But he breezes through the game to love, with a couple of ripping aces out wide. Stat alert: Wawrinka is 1-5 in his last five-setters at Wimbledon, losing his last five. Karlovic might be a year older \u2013 he\u2019s 40 now \u2013 but the Croatian is still 6ft11in, so that doesn\u2019t surprise me. Karlovic is 2-4 down in the third set. Re height of sport equipment, I was on the OBO yesterday for the Women\u2019s Ashes opener, and learned that stumps for women\u2019s ODIs are the same height as the men\u2019s, making it a lot easier for Perry/Shrubsole and co to get dismissals via lbw. A madness, although I\u2019m not advocating raising the net for Karlovic. A disappointing end to the set for Watson, but it\u2019s worth remembering that this is the first top 20 player that Watson is playing all season. Just six points were the difference between the players, with Watson\u2019s first serve probably the reason she didn\u2019t assert herself more, winning just 56% of those points to Kontaveit\u2019s 83%. Watson will have to go to the well now. The Court No 1 crowd will have to help her, it\u2019s about three quarters full right now. Regarding that news that Coco Gauff will play with Britain\u2019s Jay Clarke in the mixed doubles: I\u2019m not quite sure what the connection is there between the two? Earlier this week Clarke did praise the American for her win over Venus Williams, and suggested he would have to achieve a similar feat when he faces Roger Federer in the second round tomorrow. Obviously upsets happen all the time. If [Federer] has a bad day and I play great, then obviously there\u2019s a chance there that could happen. But what [Gauff] did yesterday was unbelievable. I\u2019m not sure going into the match she believed she could do it. She was well prepared. I\u2019m glad she did. Hello all. More serves breaking on Court No 1, with Watson the latest to fall. It\u2019s back to 3-3 in the first set, with Watson pushing back on Kontaveit\u2019s serve, it\u2019s deuce now \u2026 but two strong first serves nudges the Estonian in front: 4-3, and we\u2019re back on serve. Meanwhile, Wawrinka is making tough work of things on Court 2, down two break points at 0-1 in the final set to Opelka. But with the crowd firmly behind the Swiss, he gets back to deuce and avoids the break. Stan has never been beyond the quarter-finals here, but he\u2019s a real crowd favourite. I\u2019m off for some lunch, so I\u2019ll leave you in the very capable hands of Michael Butler. See you later ... It\u2019s a topsy-turvy first set for Watson, but she\u2019s never been a player to do things the easy way. Having broken Kontaveit in the first game, she was broken back, and has now broken again to lead 3-2. No such toing and froing on Centre Court, however, where Pliskova has surged through the first set 6-0. \u201cWhat I find equally eye-catching about the Nadal-Kyrgios practice is Kyrgios\u2019s hitting partner,\u201d emails an observant Thomas Traill. \u201cIs that Su\u00e1rez Navarro? If so, I like that he\u2019s warming up for Rafa by playing a WTA player with a one-handed backhand. Or perhaps Su\u00e1rez Navarro thinks he\u2019s a good imitation of Parmentier. Either way, nice to see some mixed singles practice.\u201d Perhaps Kyrgios and Suarez Navarro have decided to jump on the mixed doubles bandwagon together. But no ... just as I type that the mixed doubles draw is released. Krygios will partner Desirae Krawczyk, Britain\u2019s Jay Clarke teams up with Cori Gauff, the lucky chap, and of course we all know about a certain A Murray and S Williams. Over on Centre Court, Karolina Pliskova, who is many people\u2019s favourite for the title despite never going beyond the fourth round, doesn\u2019t look in the mood to mess around against Monica Puig, the surprise Olympic champion of 2016. The third seed and last week\u2019s Eastbourne champion leads 3-0. Pliskova has the perfect game for grass \u2013 but makes no secret of the fact she doesn\u2019t really like the surface. If she can change that mindset, she could go all the way. It\u2019s now past one, so it\u2019s showtime on the show courts. Heather Watson, the British No 2 who claimed her first WTA win in nearly a year in the first round, is carrying on where she left off on Monday, moving two break points up in the opening game against Estonian Anett Kontaveit on the No 1 Court. Watson breaks at the second opportunity, with Kontaveit already gifting her opponent two double faults. It\u2019s the 20th seed rather than the world No 122 with home pressure on her shoulders who is looking the more nervous. Gasparyan calls it quits. How heartbreaking. Svitolina is through, but not in the way even she would have wanted. Benoit Paire has also benefitted from a retirement, he was leading Miomir Kecmanovic by two sets to love when the Serb decided he couldn\u2019t continue, while Wawrinka has finally assumed control on the No 2 Court, where he now leads Reilly Opelka by two sets to one, 5-7, 6-3, 6-4. Gasparyan\u2019s problem seems to be muscular rather than actually in the knee, most likely cramp. She\u2019s decided to continue, but Svitolina promptly breaks and will serve at 6-5 to take the match into a deciding set. What a lucky reprieve for Svitolina, and so unfortunate for Gasparyan, who was seemingly all set for a place in the third round. Having to play his nemesis tomorrow was probably enough for Rafa \u2013 now he\u2019s got to practice next to him too ... Elina Svitolina, the eighth seed who won the WTA Finals last year but has had a fairly quiet 2019, is in the danger zone on the No 3 Court, serving to stay in the match at 7-5, 5-4 down to the Russian Margarita Gasparyan, who puts my current injury problems into context with the three surgeries she\u2019s had on her left knee. From deuce, Svitolina lives to fight another game with a gutsy hold. And now Gasparyan is clutching her leg, just above her heavily strapped suspect knee. The trainer\u2019s been called and Gasparyan, fighting back the tears, looks to be in some pain. \u201cDear Katy, I\u2019m back following your commentary as usual for want of Wimbledon coverage here in Spain except on expensive private TV so I assure you that I and the rest of the world are grateful for your\u2019s (and Jacob\u2019s) excellent, amusing coverage,\u201d emails a very kind Diana Badder. \u201cAnyway maybe you will have an opportunity to explain \u201cbouldering\u201d in the course of commentating, surely that wouldn\u2019t be throwing boulders?\u201d No throwing of boulders, Diana, I think my arms would have fallen off if I\u2019d done that. It\u2019s basically rock climbing on artificial walls, so nothing as terrifying as this \u2013 which is well worth a watch if you haven\u2019t seen it, it\u2019s staggering, heart-in-your-mouth stuff. \u201cFor the fingers and wrists aching as a result of bouldering, there\u2019s one age old solution: ice ice baby,\u201d emails the helpful and intriguingly named Freudian Snip. Sounds a far more sensible though less satisfying suggestion than the Pimm\u2019s. Meanwhile Hsieh Su-wei has sliced and diced her way past Kirsten Flipkens, discombobulating the 2013 semi-finalist 7-6 (3), 6-3. Stan is proving he can still be the man. The second most famous Swiss in tennis has levelled his match against the American upstart Reilly Opelka, securing the second set 6-3 with a hold to 30. He\u2019s even had time for a hug with a line judge too. Three is the magic number on the women\u2019s side right now. Joining Azarenka in the last 32: the 31st seed from Greece, Maria Sakkari, a 6-4, 6-1 winner over Marie Bouzkova, and the Czech Karolina Muchova, who\u2019s beaten the American Madison Brengle 6-3, 6-4. Brengle will be sorely disappointed that she wasn\u2019t able to build on her first-round win over last month\u2019s French Open runner-up, Marketa Vondrousva. You wouldn\u2019t know Azarenka has had a fallow few years given the way she\u2019s ripping up Court 12 right now. Having slid 2-0 down in the opening set against Tomljanovic, she hasn\u2019t lost a game, securing 11 on the spin, and she\u2019s serving to become the first player into round three at 6-2, 5-0. It\u2019s so exciting to see the former world No 1 performing at this level, she could be a real dark horse here, and Simona Halep, her likely opponent on Friday, certainly won\u2019t relish facing her on this form. Tomljanovic tonks a forehand into the net and that\u2019s that! Azarenka advances 6-2, 6-0. Andy Murray will begin his men\u2019s doubles campaign tomorrow, but there are several Brits embarking on theirs today, but it\u2019s not exactly going to plan. Christie and Swan are a set down, as are Dart and Dunne, while Grey and Silva are already out. Meanwhile in news that does not bode well for this live blog, my fingers and wrists already aching. I tried bouldering for the first time a couple of days ago. It was hard! Maybe not as hard as going five sets with Novak Djokovic, but hard nonetheless. Short of downing a jug or two of Pimm\u2019s to numb the pain, any tips would be gratefully received. Azarenka\u2019s still going along very nicely on Court 12, where she leads Tomljanovic 6-2, 3-0. Elsewhere, Elina Svitolina is 6-5 down on serve against the Russian Margarita Gasparyan; the eccentric Frenchman Benoit Paire has taken the first set against Serbia\u2019s Miomir Kecmanovic on a tie-break, as has Hsieh Su-wei against Kirsten Flipkens; while Pablo Cuevas is a set and a break to the good, 6-4, 1-0, against Jiri Vesely, who looks to be suffering a comedown after his win over Alex Zverev in round one. What of Stan, you say? Well he\u2019s only gone and got himself broken at the worst possible time, at five games all, leaving Opelka serving for the set. The break came out of the blue given both had been dominating on serve, and the set was seemingly heading for a tie-break. Opelka advances to 40-15 with little fuss, and Wawrinka wallops his return into the net. Wawrinka, who\u2019s giving away 11 inches to his near-seven-foot opponent, is a set down, 7-5! 15-0, 30-0, 40-0, three set points for Azarenka. She misses the first and second but comes out on top in a crazy point on the third, doing well to retrieve a drop shot, and then somehow getting her racket to what looked as if it would be a passing winner for Tomljanovic. Instead it\u2019s a winning volley for Azarenka, who takes the first set of day three after 28 minutes. The two-times Australian Open champion leads 6-2. Azarenka bags the double break for 5-2. She\u2019ll serve for the first set. The BBC screened an interview with Azarenka before her match got under way, in which she spoke quite movingly about how hard it\u2019s been for her to succeed as a tennis player having become a mother, and how she hopes to make it easier for future generations. This match started as something of a struggle too, the 2011 and 2012 semi-finalist going 2-0 down against the Australian Ajla Tomljanovic, but Azarenka is in the ascendancy now, leading 4-2. Other names in early action: Victoria Azarenka, the former world No 1, who\u2019s still playing her way back into form after giving birth to her son in 2016; Elina Svitolina, the eighth seed; Hsieh Su-wei, who defeated the 2017 French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko in round one, against the former girls\u2019 champion Kirsten Flipkens; the streetfighting American Madison Brengle; and Jiri Vesely, Alex Zverev\u2019s conqueror, against the Uruguayan Pablo Cuevas, who pulled off the shot of the day on Monday. More of the same today please, Pablo. Stan Wawrinka is kicking off a strong lineup on the No 2 Court (where my other half is watching today, the lucky chap). The three-times grand slam champion (Wawrinka that is, certainly not my other half) has a rather tall order, quite literally, against the 21-year-old American and 2015 boys\u2019 champion, Reilly Opelka, who, at 6ft 11in, is the tallest tennis pro of all time. According to his uncle, he\u2019s sick of people coming up to him asking what basketball team he plays for. It\u2019s going with serve early on, with Wawrinka leading 2-1. The players have weaved and wound their way to the outside courts and completed their warm-ups, the umpires, line judges and ball kids have taken their positions while the spectators are busy jostling for theirs, so it\u2019s time for some tennis. Let\u2019s play! Tim Henman and Tracy Austin seem to be getting on quite well on BBC One, despite England\u2019s defeat by the USA! USA!! USA!!! in the Women\u2019s World Cup semi-final. Henman, who\u2019s now a board member at the All England Club, is talking about how the new roof on the No 1 Court was called into action for the first time last night when Alison Riske played into the night, defeating Donna Vekic in three sets. This year\u2019s other major innovation, the final-set tie-break, has yet to be used, but the man whose 26-24 semi-final snoozefest last year prompted the change, Kevin Anderson, is in action today, so you never know. And a lovely gallery for your enjoyment: A big pile of reading for you: Andy Murray had until 11am this morning to decide on his mixed doubles partner, but he decided not to play hard to get or keep everyone guessing, revealing last night that he and Serena Williams are officially an item. The draw will take place today. It\u2019s interesting that Williams suggests Murray\u2019s support for the women\u2019s game played a part in her decision.

The courts here may be the most beautiful in the world, but stepping on to them was something of an occupational hazard in the first round for grand slam champions of years past, present and possibly future, with Venus Williams, Garbine Muguruza, Maria Sharapova, Naomi Osaka, Dominic Thiem, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Alexander Zverev and Denis Shapovalov being bundled out before managing to put even one W by their name. The leading players in action today, including Novak Djokovic, Stan Wawrinka, Simona Halep, Karolina Pliskova, Kevin Anderson and Caroline Wozniacki, would be well advised to be on their guard as the second round gets under way - except perhaps Djokovic, because he\u2019s, well, Novak Djokovic. Refreshingly these lawns have not proved as hazardous for the British contingent. Of the 10 who started in the singles, seven are still standing. It\u2019s an excellent, encouraging return \u2013 and the best in 13 years. Two play again today: Kyle Edmund has the honour of being on Centre Court for the second consecutive match as he faces the bullish Spaniard Fernando Verdasco, while Heather Watson, after her restorative win in round one, opens on No 1 Court against the 20th seed, Anett Kontaveit. It seems somewhat remiss not to have mentioned Cori \u201cCoco\u201d Gauff until now, given she was the star of the show on Monday with her headline-grabbing story of the ages. So can the 15-year-old, having eclipsed the the 39-year-old Venus only days after sitting a science exam, come back down to earth and refocus for her next assignment against the 2017 semi-finalist Magdalena Rybarikova? Given that the girl described as the potential future of US tennis displays a maturity far beyond her years, the signs are encouraging that she can avoid the sort of let-up that has often cut down Wimbledon giantkillers over the years. Rybarikova, however, is likely to provide a sterner challenge than Williams. Another player seemingly destined for greatness, the 18-year-old Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime who also secured his first grand slam match win on Monday, is in action too, while we\u2019ll also get to see if Yulia Putintseva, Jiri Vesely and Thomas Fabbiano can back up their victories over Osaka, Zverev and Tsitsipas respectively. Add Milos Raonic, Karen Khachanov, Feliciano Lopez, Daniil Medvedev, Victoria Azarenka, Elina Svitolina and Madison Keys into the mix, and that\u2019s your day three lineup. It may not be as strong as the other halves of the men\u2019s and women\u2019s draws but the scene is still set for a wonderful Wednesday at wonderful Wimbledon. Play begins at: 11am BST on the outside courts and 1pm BST on the show courts. Don\u2019t be late.",

      "bodyText": "Eoin Morgan promised England will stick to their typically aggressive approach after the \u201cawesome\u201d feeling of booking a first World Cup semi-final since 1992. A 119-run victory against New Zealand \u2013 powered by Jonny Bairstow\u2019s second successive century \u2013 ensured Morgan\u2019s side will play in the second semi-final next Thursday at Edgbaston, a ground where England have won their past 10 games across all formats. Either India or Australia will meet them but, after back-to-back wins to make it this far, the message from England\u2019s captain is that they stick to their guns and not revert back to the tentative cricket that threatened to derail their group-stage campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty awesome,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cI think we need to tap into what we have achieved the last two games against India and New Zealand. We must stick to our mantra the whole time and not actually be cagey, or desperate. It doesn\u2019t work for us and it won\u2019t win us the World Cup.\u201d New Zealand, who look set to also qualify for the Old Trafford semi\u2011final next Tuesday unless Pakistan can overtake their net run-rate with a huge win against Bangladesh on Friday, were always up against it after Morgan won the toss and elected to bat at Chester-le-Street. The victory was set up by a typically bullish opening stand of 123 between Bairstow and Jason Roy that powered England to 305 for eight on an increasingly sticky pitch, before rolling New Zealand for 186 as Mark Wood claimed three for 34. Wood\u2019s greatest intervention came with the removal of Kane Williamson for 27. It does not go against the fast bowler\u2019s figures, however, with the Black Caps\u2019 captain run out at the non\u2011striker\u2019s end when a driven shot by Ross Taylor touched Wood\u2019s hand before crashing into the stumps. Wood said: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know how unlucky he is because I\u2019ve got the smallest hands for a bloke you\u2019ve ever seen. I managed to just get a fingertip to it. He is one of the best players I\u2019ve ever bowled at so to get him out any way you can is pretty important. It saved me bowling at him any more so I was pretty pleased. \u201cI got lucky. It\u2019s not as if I deliberately palmed it back on the stumps. I was trying to actually stop it and got a little bit fortunate. But in big games, in big moments, you need them. I am pleased that in such a big game I managed to be so lucky.\u201d There was little fortune in the way Roy and Bairstow took apart the New Zealand attack from the outset, the former striking a 61-ball 60 before his partner went on to crack his 10th ODI century with 106 from 99 balls. The duo average 67 from 31 innings batting together \u2013 15 runs more than any pair to have played that number of matches \u2013 and can now lay claim to being one of the most destructive opening partnerships ever witnessed in one-day cricket. For their captain, it is just one element of a squad that he believes has bought into the expansive game he demanded four years ago in the wake of their disastrous 2015 World Cup. Morgan said: \u201cPushing the ceilings of what guys normally do was part of the process we\u2019ve come through in the first two years of the four-year cycle. It\u2019s incredible the talent they possess and what they can achieve on a consistent basis.\u201d Asked which players he was most proud of for reaching the knockout stages, Morgan replied: \u201cProbably all of them. Some haven\u2019t been as surprising as other guys like Joe Root, Ben Stokes and Buttler, who do extraordinary things all the time. \u201cBut guys who have come in at the start of this four-year cycle are truly some of the best players in the world. Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow are some of those players. It\u2019s been great to play with those guys and watch their journey.\u201d",

That released a cavalcade of wickets, three for bobbins in a collapse of seven for 23, from sublime Duanne Olivier yorkers to the ridiculous \u2013 Morne Morkel run out without facing. A 58-ball one from Jordan Clark was followed by a stoic four from Gareth Batty, all the time guided by Jamie Smith, the 18-year- old causing palpitations all around the ground and who finished 24 not out. But it was not enough.</p> <p><strong>Durham</strong>\u2019s<strong> </strong>captain, Cameron Bancroft, guided his side to an unlikely draw at Sedbergh. <strong>Lancashire</strong>, hampered by the non-bowling Jimmy Anderson, who had batted with a runner, and Liam Livingstone also off the field injured, set Durham 304. Saqib Mahmood was unplayable early on, bowling both Alex Lees and Graham Clark for ducks. But Bancroft, unbeaten on 92, found enough support to bat the game out.</p> <p><strong>Glamorgan</strong>, therefore, remain top of Division Two after drawing with <strong>Worcestershire</strong> at a sun-dappled Sophia Gardens, where Worcestershire were not tempted to chase down a declaration target of 326 in 66 overs. Marnus Labuschagne had earlier reached his second hundred of the game; and Brett D\u2019Oliveira took two more wickets to finish with nine, plus a century.</p> <p>At Taunton <strong>Somerset </strong>easily beat <strong>Hampshire</strong> with Jack Leach taking three for 14 and Dom Bess two for 12. <strong>Nottinghamshire</strong> fell to their fifth defeat of the season, lasting till after lunch thanks to 35 from Ravi Ashwin. Simon Harmer took four for 35 and remains the country\u2019s leading wicket-taker with 49.</p> <p>The run-fest at the County Ground was given some afternoon spice when <strong>Derbyshire</strong> collapsed to 39 for four in their second innings but Luis du Plooy calmed nerves with an unbeaten 69, on top of a first-innings century. Dawid Malan was earlier out for 199 as <strong>Middlesex</strong>, too, passed 500. <strong>Warwickshire</strong> and <strong>Kent </strong>shook hands on a high-scoring draw on a Canterbury featherbed, where Dom Sibley made a career-best 244.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d1cfcd68f08efcbe532c671\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-03T19:14:03.928Z\">8.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>What a great finish at Scarborough! </strong>Duanne Olivier snaring Gareth Batty with just ten balls to spare. And an audience of over 11,000 watched over the four days too- well done YCCC. Elsewhere, a Cameron Bancroft inspired Durham fought off a reduced Lancashire attack, Notts lost again, Somerset won again, and there were draws at Derby, Sophia Gardens and Canterbury. Runs galore, collapses to gulp at, ridiculous run outs, sensational catches: another smashing round of Championship cricket. And it all starts again on Sunday.

I\u2019m off to the dentist first thing, though hope to be back in good time for the start of play. Here\u2019s a quick round-up of what went on yesterday:</p> <blockquote> <p>A month away from the Ashes, there was a nasty scare for both England and <strong>Lancashire</strong> when James Anderson limped off the pitch at Sedbergh clutching his right calf just eight balls into his first spell of the day. He aborted his run-up three times before hobbling off with a hand on his right leg and is set to have a scan to assess the full extent of the damage. He may bat in the remainder of Lancashire\u2019s match against <strong>Durham</strong>, but won\u2019t bowl. It added to England\u2019s worries on the day they learnt that former Australian captain and galactico Steve Waugh will mentor Australia\u2019s Ashes squad during their tour of England. </p> <p>To rub salt to the wound, Marnus Labuschagne, <strong>Glamorgan</strong>\u2019s blue riband import, and Australia\u2019s incumbent No.4, became the first to a thousand County Championship runs on the way to an unbeaten 90 against <strong>Worcestershire</strong>, and his county cap. In the same game at Sophia Gardens, Brett D\u2019Oliveria completed a pinch-yourself couple of days with a century to add to Monday\u2019s seven wicket haul.</p> <p>On the batting paradise at Canterbury, <strong>Warwickshire</strong>\u2019s Dom Sibley waved his own Ashes flag with an unbeaten double-century against <strong>Kent</strong>, his fourth first-class hundred of the year. While at Trent Bridge, Ravi Bopara made a stylish hundred as <strong>Essex</strong> totted up 519 for seven before <strong>Notts</strong>\u2019 shell-shocked troops limped to 100 for five, still 205 behind. Second-placed Essex will have an eye on victory tomorrow to keep up the pressure on leaders Somerset, who declared on 358 for five at Taunton. Hampshire, chasing 418, were 12 for 1 at the close.</p> <p><strong>Surrey</strong> and <strong>Yorkshire</strong> continued their intriguing battle at Scarborough. Adam Lyth made 63 and Sam Curran took three for 75. Yorkshire go into the last day with a lead of 268 with one wicket remaining. </p> <p>Dane Vilas nurdled a <strong>Lancashire</strong> recovery from the unpromising position of 0-2, as Chris Rushworth dismissed both Keaton Jennings and Haseeb Hameed for ducks in his first over of the day. Earlier <strong>Durham</strong>\u2019s tail had collapsed as they lost five wickets for 18 against an Anderson-less Lancashire attack.</p> <p>At Hove, <strong>Northants</strong> beat <strong>Sussex </strong>in three days, after Sussex\u2019s batsmen were again filleted, this time, for 105. Ben Sanderson took four for 18 to give him match figures of 10 for 50. The 393 run defeat was Sussex\u2019s worst in Championship cricket. At the County Ground, Dawid Malan clocked up 177 not out, after <strong>Middlesex</strong> fought back against <strong>Derby</strong>.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-03T08:52:39.069Z\">at 9.52am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "There was a nail-nibblingy close finish at Scarborough where Yorkshire grabbed the new ball with three overs of the day left and bowled out the reigning champions Surrey with 10 deliveries left. Set a target of 318 to win, Surrey seemed to be easing to victory at 157 for two just before tea until Dean Elgar was run out for 71. That released a cavalcade of wickets, three for bobbins in a collapse of seven for 23, from sublime Duanne Olivier yorkers to the ridiculous \u2013 Morne Morkel run out without facing. A 58-ball one from Jordan Clark was followed by a stoic four from Gareth Batty, all the time guided by Jamie Smith, the 18-year- old causing palpitations all around the ground and who finished 24 not out. But it was not enough. Durham\u2019s captain, Cameron Bancroft, guided his side to an unlikely draw at Sedbergh. Lancashire, hampered by the non-bowling Jimmy Anderson, who had batted with a runner, and Liam Livingstone also off the field injured, set Durham 304. Saqib Mahmood was unplayable early on, bowling both Alex Lees and Graham Clark for ducks. But Bancroft, unbeaten on 92, found enough support to bat the game out. Glamorgan, therefore, remain top of Division Two after drawing with Worcestershire at a sun-dappled Sophia Gardens, where Worcestershire were not tempted to chase down a declaration target of 326 in 66 overs. Marnus Labuschagne had earlier reached his second hundred of the game; and Brett D\u2019Oliveira took two more wickets to finish with nine, plus a century. At Taunton Somerset easily beat Hampshire with Jack Leach taking three for 14 and Dom Bess two for 12. Nottinghamshire fell to their fifth defeat of the season, lasting till after lunch thanks to 35 from Ravi Ashwin. Simon Harmer took four for 35 and remains the country\u2019s leading wicket-taker with 49. The run-fest at the County Ground was given some afternoon spice when Derbyshire collapsed to 39 for four in their second innings but Luis du Plooy calmed nerves with an unbeaten 69, on top of a first-innings century. Dawid Malan was earlier out for 199 as Middlesex, too, passed 500. Warwickshire and Kent shook hands on a high-scoring draw on a Canterbury featherbed, where Dom Sibley made a career-best 244. What a great finish at Scarborough! Duanne Olivier snaring Gareth Batty with just ten balls to spare. And an audience of over 11,000 watched over the four days too- well done YCCC. Elsewhere, a Cameron Bancroft inspired Durham fought off a reduced Lancashire attack, Notts lost again, Somerset won again, and there were draws at Derby, Sophia Gardens and Canterbury. Runs galore, collapses to gulp at, ridiculous run outs, sensational catches: another smashing round of Championship cricket. And it all starts again on Sunday. Thanks as always for all the emails and comments BTL. Good night! Cameron Bancroft , with an unbeaten 92, guides Durham to an unexpected draw at Sedbergh against a Lancashire attack shorn of both James Anderson and Liam Livingstone. Lancashire now sit in Glamorgan\u2019s tailwind in the Division Two table, with a game in hand. Durham rise to eighth. A thriller! Blimey, make a cup of tea and Clark\u2019s 58 ball epic is ended, bowled Olivier for one. And Morkel run out without facing. OR is it Smith? The BBC can\u2019t make its mind up. Surely they can\u2019t both be run out by Kohler-Cadmore? Ah, it was Morkel. Good decision boys. All down to Gareth Batty and Smith now. What a good game! Nine wickets and a century for Brett D\u2019Oliveira; two centuries and a thousand runs for Marnus Labuschagne and a tempting declaration and a doughty response. Glamorgan remain unbeaten and - for now - top; Worcestershire move up to sixth in a crowded middle-order and have a game in hand over every team above them. So just two to watch now....Jordan Clark in the midst of an outstanding 45 ball 0 not out at Scarborough - Surrey 177 for 7. Jamie Smith 17 not out. And at Sedbergh, Cameron Bancroft is still there unbeaten on 72, Lancashire need four wickets, off twenty overs. Handshakes at the end of another high-scoring game. Derbyshire survive a late attack of the collie-wobbles, thanks to Leus du Plooy who added an unbeaten 69 to his first-innings century. Derby now a heady fourth in the Division Two table, Middlesex slip to eighth. Derby: Derbyshire 557-6dec (Reece 96, Godleman 102, du Plooy 118) and 178-6dec v Middlesex 520 (Malan 199, Simpson 115) All over, just 11 short of matching scores. Kent take ten points, Warwicks nine. Fifth placed Kent next play Surrey at The Oval, while Warwicks go to the Rose Bowl. Canterbury: Kent 585-7dec (Dickson 161, Bell-Drummond 166) v Warwickshire 574-7 (Rhodes 109; Sibley 244) The tension is building at Canterbury - will Warwickshire overtake Kent before they shake hands and retire to the beer tent? Just 24 runs will do it. Steven Mullaney had to troop down to face the press again at Trent Bridge. Not a pleasant experience for anyone. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got any excuses. We have been outplayed again. If we don\u2019t do well I don\u2019t make excuses but we need to turn it round and try and put on a show for the last six games.\u201d Maharaj gets another! Clarke for the third duck of Surrey\u2019s innngs! 163-7... Surrey toss the script over the boundary and onto South Bay. Maharaj earning his (possibly) big bucks by dismissing Ryan Patel for nine. The Surrey pair at the crease are the boy with the world at his feet, Jamie Smith, and the walk-in-wardrobe Rikki Clarke. They need another 155 with four wickets left. Liam Livingstone off the field too at Sedbergh - Durham need 170 to win, or have a session to survive. And some related news, Lancashire Thunder have re-signed Indian T20 captain Harmanpreet Kaur for the summer. DIVISION ONE Canterbury: Kent 585-7dec (Dickson 161, Bell-Drummond 166) v Warwickshire 531-7 (Rhodes 109; Sibley 244) Scarborough: Yorkshire 327 (Fraine 106; Clark 5-77) and 352 (S Curran 3-90) v Surrey 362 (Stoneman 100) and 159-5 (Elgar 71). Surrey need 159 to win. DIVISION TWO Derby: Derbyshire 557-6dec (Reece 96, Godleman 102, du Plooy 118) and 126-4 v Middlesex 520 (Malan 199, Simpson 115) Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan 449 (Labuschagne 106; Lloyd 97; D\u2019Oliverira 7-92) and 246-5dec (Labuschagne 100, D\u2019Oliveira 2-90) v Worcestershire 370 (D\u2019Oliveira 103; Hogan 5-62) and 107-1 (Ferguson 55 not out). Worcestershire need 219 to win. Sedbergh: Lancashire 337 (Vilas 72) and 247 (Vilas 85; Rimmington 4-42) v Durham 281 (Bancroft 77; Onions 5-93) and 122-5 (Saqib Mahmood 2-29; Bancroft 57 not out). Durham need 182 to win. Results Trent Bridge: Essex win by an innings and 23 runs. Nottinghamshire 213 (Mullaney 74) and 183 (Duckett 39, Ashwin 35; Harmer 4-35) v Essex 519-9dec (Browne 163, Bopara 135; Ravi Ashwin 3-162) Hove: Northants beat Sussex by 393 runs. Northamptonshire 273 (Zaib 54; Robinson 6-63) and 331 (Vasconcelos 88;Robinson 5-69); Sussex 106 (Sanderson 6-37) and 105 ( Brown 46; Sanderson 4-18, Hutton 4-32) Taunton: Somerset beat Hampshire by 313 runs. Somerset 408 (Hildreth 105; Abbott 6-84) and 353-8dec (Azhar 79 ) v Hampshire 349 (Northeast 101; Jamie Overton 5-70) and 104-9 (Leach 3-14) Derby, boringly, pulling up the drawbridge, just when it was getting exciting. Now 120 for four, with du Plooy and Hussein both in the forties, and a lead over Middlesex of 161. Onions gets Durham in a soup - Trevaskis caught behind for three and time to batten down the hatches at 120-5. Five wickets needed for the Jimmy-less attack, just over a session to survive. Whoops! Surrey lose two for nowt. Elgar run-out by David Willey and Ben Foakes bowled by Ben Coad. Surrey 157-4, need 161 to win. So Surrey need 170 more in 35 overs...at just less than five an over. And the Scarborough sun did shine, and the Scarborough wind did blow and it looks like a repeat of last year\u2019s result when Surrey had to chase 228 and made it with seven wickets in hand. Rory Burns top-scored with 97. Cameron Bancroft gets his second fifty in the match for Durham, but Josh Bohannon breaks the 69 run partnership, bowling Graham Clark. Durham, four wickets down, need another 194 to win. Lucky, lucky Sedbergh with this slam-dunkingly beautiful weather. Guildford and Liverpool look over enviously. The pitch was expected to take some turn at Scarborough, but nothing troubling Surrey too much. David Willey grabs the wicket of Borthwick; Yorkshire need to take advantage of Patel\u2019s nerves if they\u2019re going to stop Surrey powering to their second win in a row. Surrey need 169 to win, with eight wickets in hand. Five hundred each at Canterbury too, where Tim Ambrose and Tim Mike are enjoying some afternoon batting practice. Strange goings on at Derby, where both sides notched up 500 in their first innings but Derbyshire are now 69 for four. Nathan Sowter 2 for 22. Here\u2019s one of Saqib\u2019s wicket at Sedbergh from earlier. Durham now 100-3: No Mes, I will not say that Ferguson and Mitchell are looking comfortable against Glamorgan (55-1). And Durham nay-saying at Sedberg, 94 for 3, need 210. Ravi Ashwin\u2019s 35 was the highlight of that sigh to the inevitable at Trent Bridge. Good bowling by Essex all round, with Simon Harmer\u2019s 4-35 taking the bouquets. Post-mortem No.23 for Peter Moores; Essex still in the hunt. Trent Bridge: Essex win by an innings and 23 runs. Nottinghamshire 213 (Mullaney 74) and 183 (Duckett 39, Ashwin 35; Harmer 4-35) v Essex 519-9dec (Browne 163, Bopara 135; Ravi Ashwin 3-162) It\u2019s tricky to know whether this (Derby 34-2) or Notts\u2019 earlier effort wins run out of the round. Run out of the week goes to Fabian Allen and Nicholas Pooran at Chester-le-Street as they advanced on Sri Lanka. Glamorgan have declared and Worcestershire need 326 to win. Joshua Dell is snared lbw by Carey for one. Worcs 22 for one. Somerset captain Tom Abell treads where few dare: \u201cOf course, we can\u2019t avoid thinking about that first ever title because so much is written and spoken about it. But it\u2019s for the supporters and media to get excited. We will continue to look no further ahead than the next game, which is now against Notts next week. If we can win that it will be another important step towards our goal.\u201d I\u2019m not sure the next game will be too much of a problem, Tom. Simon Harmer now has 4-35 as Notts lose Stuart Broad lbw for six. Ravi Ashwin hanging in there, 27 not out. Notts 175 for nine I\u2019m worried about the safety of my chocolate money as the iffy Surrey batting continues thrashing the Yorkies to all parts of Scarborough after lunch. Durham lose another, Burnham to Onions for 20. But Bancroft, who has found his form in the last couple of weeks, still there on 14. Durham 49-3. And cement their place at the top of the table! They pocket 24 points from their sixth win in eight games. Somerset 408 (Hildreth 105; Abbott 6-84) and 353-8dec (Azhar 79 ) v Hampshire 349 (Northeast 101; Jamie Overton 5-70) and 104-9 (Leach 3-14) DIVISION ONE Canterbury: Kent 585-7dec (Dickson 161, Bell-Drummond 166) v Warwickshire 426-6 (Rhodes 109; Sibley 244) Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire 213 (Mullaney 74) and 165-8 (Duckett 39; Harmer 3-30) v Essex 519-9dec (Browne 163, Bopara 135; Ravi Ashwin 3-162) Notts trail by 141. Scarborough: Yorkshire 327 (Fraine 106; Clark 5-77) and 352 (S Curran 3-90) v Surrey 362 (Stoneman 100) and 68-0. Surrey need 250 to win. DIVISION TWO Derby: Derbyshire 557-6dec (Reece 96, Godleman 102, du Plooy 118) and 10-0 v Middlesex 520 (Malan 199, Simpson 115) Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan 449 (Labuschagne 106; Lloyd 97; D\u2019Oliverira 7-92) and 246-5 (Labuschagne 100, D\u2019Oliveira 2-90) v Worcestershire 370 (D\u2019Oliveira 103; Hogan 5-62). Glamorgan lead by 325. Sedbergh: Lancashire 337 (Vilas 72) and 247 (Vilas 85; Rimmington 4-42) v Durham 281 (Bancroft 77; Onions 5-93) and 39-2 (Saqib Mahmood 2-13). Durham need 265 to win. Results Hove: Northants beat Sussex by 393 runs. Northamptonshire 273 (Zaib 54; Robinson 6-63) and 331 (Vasconcelos 88;Robinson 5-69); Sussex 106 (Sanderson 6-37) and 105 ( Brown 46; Sanderson 4-18, Hutton 4-32) Taunton: Somerset beat Hampshire by 313 runs. Somerset 408 (Hildreth 105; Abbott 6-84) and 353-8dec (Azhar 79 ) v Hampshire 349 (Northeast 101; Jamie Overton 5-70) and 104-9 (Leach 3-14) Lunch everywhere except Taunton. Scores to follow. On the one hand, Notts are still batting at lunch. There is no other hand. 161 for 8 - three for Harmer, two for Beard and 19 not out for Ravi Ashwin. Not sure he\u2019s got the measure of the Notts-up yet. And at Taunton, Jack Leach has made a double breakthrough, splitting up the partnership of 57 between Sam Northeast and James Fuller by dismissing Northeast for 23, and in his next over, Keith Barker for four. Hampshire nervously knee-knocking at 93 for six. Lancs aren\u2019t tweeting the wickets from Sedbergh but they\u2019ve described Saqib\u2019s second thus: \u201cSaqib Mahmood is sprinting across the ground after ripping two stumps out of the ground. Gareth Harte is bowled for 0.\u201d Durham 26 for 2. Two sessions and ten minutes to go... Dom Sibley waves his three lions underpants and asks Kevin Pietersen for the number of his tattooist. Now 242, he has equalled his highest previous first-class score. Will he go triple-Daddy? The game could do with some sort of goal. Surrey absolutely flying - 43 for 0 off nine overs, and Yorkshire have already played their best four cards. And a wicket for Mahmood at Sedbergh - Lees for a duck in his first over. Durham 10 for one including seven extras. Interesting little scoop here by Ali: And more Marnus trivia: he is the first Glamorgan player to score two centuries in the same Championship match since Jonathan Hughes in 2005. So... an eight ball duck for Jimmy Anderson. Rimmington 4-42. Durham need 304 to win... a golden opportunity for Saqib Mahmood? Yesterday Joe Leach said of Brett D\u2019Oliveira: \u201cBrett\u2019s innings was probably one of the best I\u2019ve seen in a Worcestershire shirt. It took us from a position where we just avoided the follow on and were staring down the barrel of 150, for us then to start bowling with an 80 run deficit to give us a chance to win the game if we\u2019d bowled a bit better in the last session. Both [batting and bowling]achievements, on their own and together, are outstanding.\u201d And now the boy has two more. Just one more tasty wicket for the ten fer and hundred in a match. Anyone know who the last Worcestershire player to do that was? Oh, Dawid Malan. Caught and bowled for 199 against Derbyshire, the end of a 224 run 7th wicket stand with John Simpson. His highest first-class score but still - the frustration. Middx 480 for seven. Ben Coad 48 not out at Scarborough as Yorkies bowled out for 352, a lead of 317. Tasty little challenge there - the lowest score of the match needed for Surrey to clinch it, but with Maharaj, Olivier and Coad and Surrey\u2019s batsmen a bit iffy.... my (chocolate) money\u2019s on Yorkshire. And Duckett\u2019s gone at Trent Bridge - 110/6 -I can\u2019t keep up. Notts and Hants in a race to destruction and an early lunch. Rossouw joins the party in the pavilion. Hampshire 39 for four. Gregory 2-15, JOverton 2-18. Hey-ho, Labuschagne is out for exactly 100. Glamorgan 164 for 2, a lead of 243. I assume they\u2019ll thrash about for a bit more and then declare? They\u2019ve done very well out of their overseas batsmen over the last two years with Usman Khawaja and then Labuschagne. The power of the daffodil. Marnus Labuschagne! He celebrates becoming the first to 1000 runs with a century against Worcestershire - off just 112 balls. I\u2019d only just clicked that he was Australia\u2019s incumbent Test No.4, Steve Smith\u2019s natural place in the batting order. Interesting to see how it all develops - the Australia v Australia A four-day bun-fight for places will be worth popping into if you\u2019re around. At The Rose Bowl - 23, 24, 25, 26 July An unfortunate early wicket for Hampshire, no sorry make that two: Rahane snaffled by Gregory, and Abbott by JOverton. Hants 18-3 and the day stretches endlessly ahead. DIVISION ONE Canterbury: Kent 585-7dec (Dickson 161, Bell-Drummond 166) v Warwickshire 400-3 (Rhodes 109; Sibley 207 not out) Trent Bridge: Nottinghamshire 213 (Mullaney 74) and 100-5 v Essex519-9dec (Browne 163, Bopara 135; Ravi Ashwin 3-162) Taunton: Somerset 408 (Hildreth 105; Abbott 6-84) and 353-8dec (Azhar 79 ) v Hampshire 349 (Northeast 101; Jamie Overton 5-70) and 12-1 Scarborough: Yorkshire 327 (Fraine 106; Clark 5-77) and 303-9 (S Curran 3-75) v Surrey 362 (Stoneman 100) DIVISION TWO Derby: Derbyshire 557-6dec (Reece 96, Godleman 102, du Plooy 118) v Middlesex 436-6 (Malan 177 not out) Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan 449 (Labuschagne 106; Lloyd 97; D\u2019Oliverira 7-92) and 137-1 (Labuschagne 90 not out) v Worcestershire 370 (D\u2019Oliveira 103; Hogan 5-62) Sedbergh: Lancashire 337 (Vilas 72) and 204-7 (Vilas 74 not out) v Durham 281 (Bancroft 77; Onions 5-93) Hove: NORTHANTS WIN BY 393 RUNS. Sussex v Northamptonshire 273 (Zaib 54; Robinson 6-63) and 331 (Vasconcelos 88;Robinson 5-69); Sussex 106 (Sanderson 6-37) and 105 ( Brown 46; Sanderson 4-18, Hutton 4-32) And one last thing before I put up the start of play scores - CONGRATULATIONS TO LEICESTERSHIRE\u2019S HASSAN AZAD -a first in engineering! Some good news from Sedbergh. And bad news from Sky, who have decided that they won\u2019t be sharing their World Cup final bounty with free to air, even if England are in it. Also the left size of my mouth is the size of a Christmas Stilton and I can\u2019t have a coffee for an hour. So bear with me. Over at Chester le Street, England have won the toss and are batting. New Zealand are without Lockie Ferguson, out with a tight hamstring. They\u2019re off and the first ball of the day just went for four byes. Follow every over with word composing machine and ultimate OBO guru Rob Smyth . It\u2019s a beautiful start to the day here in Manchester, singing birds and the strawberries red and tubby in the back garden. I\u2019m off to the dentist first thing, though hope to be back in good time for the start of play. Here\u2019s a quick round-up of what went on yesterday: A month away from the Ashes, there was a nasty scare for both England and Lancashire when James Anderson limped off the pitch at Sedbergh clutching his right calf just eight balls into his first spell of the day. He aborted his run-up three times before hobbling off with a hand on his right leg and is set to have a scan to assess the full extent of the damage. He may bat in the remainder of Lancashire\u2019s match against Durham, but won\u2019t bowl. It added to England\u2019s worries on the day they learnt that former Australian captain and galactico Steve Waugh will mentor Australia\u2019s Ashes squad during their tour of England. To rub salt to the wound, Marnus Labuschagne, Glamorgan\u2019s blue riband import, and Australia\u2019s incumbent No.4, became the first to a thousand County Championship runs on the way to an unbeaten 90 against Worcestershire, and his county cap. In the same game at Sophia Gardens, Brett D\u2019Oliveria completed a pinch-yourself couple of days with a century to add to Monday\u2019s seven wicket haul. On the batting paradise at Canterbury, Warwickshire\u2019s Dom Sibley waved his own Ashes flag with an unbeaten double-century against Kent, his fourth first-class hundred of the year. While at Trent Bridge, Ravi Bopara made a stylish hundred as Essex totted up 519 for seven before Notts\u2019 shell-shocked troops limped to 100 for five, still 205 behind. Second-placed Essex will have an eye on victory tomorrow to keep up the pressure on leaders Somerset, who declared on 358 for five at Taunton. Hampshire, chasing 418, were 12 for 1 at the close. Surrey and Yorkshire continued their intriguing battle at Scarborough. Adam Lyth made 63 and Sam Curran took three for 75. Yorkshire go into the last day with a lead of 268 with one wicket remaining. Dane Vilas nurdled a Lancashire recovery from the unpromising position of 0-2, as Chris Rushworth dismissed both Keaton Jennings and Haseeb Hameed for ducks in his first over of the day. Earlier Durham\u2019s tail had collapsed as they lost five wickets for 18 against an Anderson-less Lancashire attack. At Hove, Northants beat Sussex in three days, after Sussex\u2019s batsmen were again filleted, this time, for 105. Ben Sanderson took four for 18 to give him match figures of 10 for 50. The 393 run defeat was Sussex\u2019s worst in Championship cricket. At the County Ground, Dawid Malan clocked up 177 not out, after Middlesex fought back against Derby.",

      "bodyText": "Families on universal credit are being plunged into debt because of increased childcare and food costs during school holidays, parents have told a committee of MPs as they appealed for help to manage the extra costs. The parliamentary hearing on holiday hunger heard from parents and charities about struggling families where parents have to stop working during the school holidays or pay crippling additional childcare costs up front. Under universal credit, families need to pay the cost of childcare in advance, then claim the cost back via the benefit system, meaning delays of several weeks until they receive a refund. Nicola Salvato, a single parent in receipt of universal credit, told the MPs: \u201cI\u2019m working, so my child is being looked after during the summer holidays. I\u2019ve had to reduce my working hours to manage the upfront costs for childcare. But I\u2019ve still got to come up with, for August, about \u00a3750 on top of my rent, food, travel costs and all of that.\u201d Heidi Allen, a former Conservative who is now an independent MP, said forcing families to pay up front was \u201ctotally bonkers, and I can\u2019t believe that the penny won\u2019t finally drop and [the government] will change that\u201d.

They don\u2019t explain things to you. They just say: \u2018Look for work, there\u2019s your job, bye.\u2019\u201d Martha Mackenzie, the director of UK poverty policy at Save the Children, said the need to pay for holiday childcare was \u201ca huge financial burden\u201d for low-income families, with well over three-quarters having no savings to fall back on. \u201cA lot of other costs under universal credit are much more permanent \u2013 you know how much you are paying in rent, you know broadly what your utility and food costs \u2013 whereas childcare is nothing like that. Parents are seeing it fluctuate month to month,\u201d Mackenzie said. \u201cAnd when something like a holiday comes along \u2026 you sometimes have to find up to \u00a3800 a month extra, which is money that people just do not have lying around.\u201d The joint committee also heard of other increased costs, such as holiday activities and additional food for families eligible for free school meals during term-time. Several of the parents said they had gone hungry during the holidays to ensure their children had enough to eat. \u201cAs a parent, you do eat less, because children are the priority. I know that at times I have had less to eat because I want them to have more,\u201d one of the parents, Anne Newbold, told the MPs. Asked by Frank Field, the chair of the DWP select committee, if there was enough food for her, Newbold replied: \u201cThere\u2019s always cereal, isn\u2019t there?\u201d Abby Jitendra, the policy and research manager of the Trussell Trust, said this summer was likely to be the busiest on record for the trust\u2019s food banks. \u201cThere is so much that the government could do to provide support during the holidays, but fundamentally, if people can\u2019t afford the very basics like food and activities all year round, the problem is only going to continue,\u201d she said. The parents said they benefited from local charities offering free or subsidised activities and lunches during the holidays, such as the St James Centre and youth charity the Hive in Birkenhead. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t survive without them. They are our backbone,\u201d said Dawn Taplin, a parent from the Wirral. The Department for Education has said that it will extend its programme of free meals and activities over the summer holidays this year across 11 areas, including Leeds, Newcastle and Plymouth.",

He had made his ODI debut four years earlier, played six games and never got past 41. He came back post-Southee, at the end of that first heady summer of McCullum in 2015. Since when it has been more or less as it was here.</p> <p>England had made 44 after five overs. Bairstow\u2019s own high-grade fifty came up with nine fours from 46 balls. He waved his bat pointedly to the dressing room, once again silencing the media critics (who all like him). The 100 partnership arrived in the 15th over, bowled by the mournful Colin De Grandhomme. Some bowlers bound to the wicket as though approaching some vital point of destiny. With De Grandhomme every day is the retreat from Moscow.</p> <p>New Zealand bowled too short or too full or too slowly. Bairstow ran like a maniac or stood still to hit with stunning power.

Two balls later he topped it with a floaty hip-high full toss. Bairstow steered both through square-leg to reach three figures.</p> <p>He took off his helmet, rubbed his hair and took in the warm swell of applause around the Riverside stands. There is a violent kind of beauty in Bairstow\u2019s batting when he plays like this, not so much arrogance or swagger as a physical assurance given only to the most natural of athletes.</p> <p>Perhaps that multi-hatted cricketing existence has also disguised the through-the-roof brilliance of his ODI batting. Since May 2017 Bairstow has scored 2,277 runs at 54 with nine hundreds. No other England ODI batsman averages over 45 with a strike rate above 100. Twice in five days he has won defining generational games for his country. The argument as to whether Bairstow is England\u2019s finest could simply start with the question: who has been better?</p> <p>Just maybe don\u2019t tell him yet. The rest of the order scrabbled a little to reach 307. Chris Woakes and Jofra Archer once again knocked the top off the chase. Chester-le-Street cooked gently in the late afternoon sun, with a wonderful feeling of space and light around those low stands. England will travel from here to Edgbaston next Thursday, still hitting from the front, still led by their own oddly spiky white-ball giant; and two steps now from a kind of cricketing heaven.</p>",

He came back post-Southee, at the end of that first heady summer of McCullum in 2015. Since when it has been more or less as it was here. England had made 44 after five overs. Bairstow\u2019s own high-grade fifty came up with nine fours from 46 balls. He waved his bat pointedly to the dressing room, once again silencing the media critics (who all like him). The 100 partnership arrived in the 15th over, bowled by the mournful Colin De Grandhomme. Some bowlers bound to the wicket as though approaching some vital point of destiny. With De Grandhomme every day is the retreat from Moscow. New Zealand bowled too short or too full or too slowly. Bairstow ran like a maniac or stood still to hit with stunning power. At 176 for one in the 28th over he waited, let the tension leave his shoulders and lofted Southee over mid-off for a six on to the black tarpaulins to move to ninety. Next over Southee sent down, perhaps the worst ball Bairstow will receive at this World Cup, a 75mph slower ball half-tracker. Two balls later he topped it with a floaty hip-high full toss. Bairstow steered both through square-leg to reach three figures. He took off his helmet, rubbed his hair and took in the warm swell of applause around the Riverside stands. There is a violent kind of beauty in Bairstow\u2019s batting when he plays like this, not so much arrogance or swagger as a physical assurance given only to the most natural of athletes. Perhaps that multi-hatted cricketing existence has also disguised the through-the-roof brilliance of his ODI batting. Since May 2017 Bairstow has scored 2,277 runs at 54 with nine hundreds. No other England ODI batsman averages over 45 with a strike rate above 100. Twice in five days he has won defining generational games for his country. The argument as to whether Bairstow is England\u2019s finest could simply start with the question: who has been better? Just maybe don\u2019t tell him yet. The rest of the order scrabbled a little to reach 307. Chris Woakes and Jofra Archer once again knocked the top off the chase. Chester-le-Street cooked gently in the late afternoon sun, with a wonderful feeling of space and light around those low stands. England will travel from here to Edgbaston next Thursday, still hitting from the front, still led by their own oddly spiky white-ball giant; and two steps now from a kind of cricketing heaven.",

      "bodyText": "England would have spent plenty of time in the lead-up to their encounter with New Zealand pondering the best way to winkle out Kane Williamson. The Black Caps\u2019 captain had been averaging 113 in the tournament, with match-winning centuries against South Africa and West Indies that had once again underlined his status among the world\u2019s elite batsmen. Williamson plays the ball late and under his eyes. He eliminates risk while still scoring positively. His wry sense of humour is in keeping with a cricketer devoid of ego, such that he scarcely loses concentration or allows the heat of battle to induce mistakes. In short, he is bloody hard to budge. But in the end, as New Zealand looked to hunt down a target of 306 for their highest total of the campaign, this highly prized scalp came down not to a pre\u2011hatched plan or a wonder ball but instead the merest flicker of a finger. There is arguably no more galling way to be out in cricket than when backing up at the non-striker\u2019s end. And yet in the 16th over Williamson found himself staring at the big screen hoping, desperately, that he was safe from this particular fate. It was not to be, with the replay showing that Ross Taylor\u2019s straight drive off a Mark Wood yorker had touched the bowler\u2019s outstretched hand and, having crashed into the stumps, caught the New Zealand captain out of his ground. The sell-out crowd erupted in delight, knowing this was likely the moment that England\u2019s semi-final berth had been sealed. Wood, who had around 50 friends and family among them, wore the face of a lottery winner as his fellow local, Ben Stokes, engulfed him in an almighty bear hug. If Adil Rashid\u2019s slingshot throw to run out Taylor nine balls later was testament to the Yorkshireman\u2019s hard work in training, then Wood\u2019s intervention felt an embodiment of the fortune that has seemingly gone England\u2019s way since the defeat by Australia at Lord\u2019s. Up to this point the soggy weather had seen them play on trickier pitches than they had envisaged. They lost Jason Roy for three games with a torn hamstring. Marginal decisions were going against them, such as the early lbw shout against the centurion Aaron Finch when on 18 or Jonny Bairstow\u2019s first-baller in the defeat against Sri Lanka. Their perilous predicament had resulted from some inflexible batting on said surfaces and heightened anxiety in the squad. But there was nevertheless a sense that, after four years spent working towards this home World Cup, events were somehow also conspiring against them. When sunshine broke out over Birmingham three days before the India game, and Roy was patched up sufficiently to return, it somehow marked a fresh start to their campaign in this regard. At Edgbaston Eoin Morgan won the first of two helpful tosses in these quasi-quarter-finals. Roy and Jonny Bairstow saw early inside edges miss the stumps by a whisker.

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.</p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europeif there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But separate analysis by Labour suggests a string of emergency bills on issues from medicines regulation to new rules and systems for the border in Northern Ireland would still need to be passed, even in a no-deal scenario.</p> \n<p>Any of them could potentially be seized on \u2013 and amended \u2013 by MPs looking for a mechanism to block a no-deal Brexit, or perhaps even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/24/brexit-petition-to-revoke-article-50-reaches-5m-signatures\">revoke </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/24/brexit-petition-to-revoke-article-50-reaches-5m-signatures\">article 50</a>.</p> \n<p>Starmer said: \u201cIt\u2019s simply unsustainable to sideline parliament on an issue of this importance.

But separate analysis by Labour suggests a string of emergency bills on issues from medicines regulation to new rules and systems for the border in Northern Ireland would still need to be passed, even in a no-deal scenario. Any of them could potentially be seized on \u2013 and amended \u2013 by MPs looking for a mechanism to block a no-deal Brexit, or perhaps even revoke article 50. Starmer said: \u201cIt\u2019s simply unsustainable to sideline parliament on an issue of this importance. And it\u2019s deeply irresponsible to ignore the legal black hole that a no-deal Brexit would cause.\u201d However, Johnson\u2019s team insist they are likely to be able to persuade the EU27 to make changes to the withdrawal agreement, including the contentious Irish backstop. They then believe Johnson will return in triumph to Westminster and win a majority for his Brexit deal in parliament. Johnson hopes the threat to Tory seats from Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party, combined with a perception that he \u2013 unlike May \u2013 would be willing to press ahead with a no-deal departure if MPs reject his agreement, will change the political mood. This interpretation has been supported in recent days by several Labour MPs including Lisa Nandy and Gareth Snell suggesting they could vote for something similar to the withdrawal agreement if it were put before parliament. Labour\u2019s position, reiterated by Jeremy Corbyn in the Commons on Wednesday, is that any Brexit deal should be subject to a referendum. He asked May: \u201cDoes the prime minister agree that whoever succeeds her should have the courage to go back to the people with their preferred Brexit option to end the uncertainty and get Brexit resolved?\u201d May responded by criticising Labour\u2019s refusal to support her Brexit deal. Starmer is one of the shadow ministers, alongside the key Corbyn allies Diane Abbott and John McDonnell, who are pressing for Labour to declare it would support remain in any such referendum. But Corbyn has insisted he is continuing to consult on the issue. And he has made reference to the precedent set by the former Labour prime minister Harold Wilson. Wilson called the 1975 referendum on common market membership when he was presiding over a deeply divided Labour cabinet, but while the government\u2019s official position was to recommend staying in, he allowed ministers to campaign on both sides.",

The rightwing site the Antagonist (O Antagonista) reported on Tuesday that federal police had asked a money-laundering unit at Brazil\u2019s finance ministry to investigate the \u201cfinancial activities\u201d of Glenn Greenwald. Police declined to comment on the allegation but confirmed an investigation had been launched into the hacking of cellphones that led to the leaks. \u201cThis seems to me like an attempt to intimidate the journalist,\u201d said Kennedy Alencar, a leading political commentator on CBN Radio. \u201cIf there is an investigation for doing journalism it is illegal and it is an attempt at intimidation,\u201d said Pierpaolo Bottini, a professor of penal law at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo who heads the press freedom unit at the Brazilian Bar Association. Greenwald, who lives in Rio de Janeiro, won a Pulitzer prize for leading the Guardian\u2019s reporting on National Security Agency (NSA) spying revealed by Edward Snowden before co-founding the Intercept website in 2014. Last month, the publication\u2019s Brazilian edition launched the first in a string of bombshell articles which appeared to show prosecutors in the sweeping Operation Car Wash corruption inquiry colluding with S\u00e9rgio Moro, the judge who became a hero in Brazil for jailing powerful businessmen, middlemen and politicians. The leaked records \u2013 which the Intercept said it received from an anonymous source \u2013 have had an explosive impact on Brazilian politics and dominated headlines for weeks. On Sunday, leaks published in the Folha de S Paulo newspaper cast fresh doubts over key testimony in the case against former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva for graft and money laundering. Lula\u2019s conviction removed him from last year\u2019s presidential race. After the far-right candidate Bolsonaro won, he made Moro his justice minister. Moro refused to say whether federal police \u2013 which he controls \u2013 were investigating Greenwald during a tumultuous hearing on Tuesday at Brazil\u2019s congress. He defended the corruption investigation, attacked \u201csensationalist\u201d reporting and said the Intercept leaks were an \u201cempty balloon\u201d that failed to prove any wrongdoing. \u201cThere is a criminal attempt to invalidate convictions,\u201d Moro said. A spokesman for the federal police said he could not confirm nor deny they was looking at Greenwald\u2019s finances. \u201cThe investigation we have is to investigate the hacking of the data,\u201d he said. A spokeswoman for the money-laundering unit said they did not comment on specific cases but had \u201cno knowledge\u201d of the request. But reports of the alleged investigation prompted anger among press freedom groups and opposition politicians. \u201cWe see this as a brutal violation of press freedom,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Guimar\u00e3es, a congressman from Lula\u2019s Workers\u2019 party. \u201cIt\u2019s not only an outrageous attack on press freedom, but a gross abuse of power,\u201d said Trevor Timm, executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, in a statement. The leaks have enraged Bolsonaro\u2019s supporters \u2013 crowds of whom demonstrated across Brazil on Sunday in support of Moro. Greenwald and his husband David Miranda, a congressman for the leftist Socialism and Freedom party, have faced a barrage of threats, slander and homophobic abuse. \u201cThis is what Bolsonaro and Moro are now doing: using the Federal Police they control to investigate me in retaliation for my reporting,\u201d Greenwald tweeted.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s been a busy few days for the prime minister. The weekend in Japan for the G20 summit and then a couple of days in Brussels while the other EU countries divvied up the top jobs between them. But everywhere Theresa May went she was treated with polite indifference. A ghost at the wedding. The louder she yells for some kind of legacy by which she can be remembered \u2013 even a photo opportunity with a minor dignitary would do \u2013 the less she is heard. So rapidly is she being airbrushed out of her life, not even she is entirely certain she really exists.</p> <p>There wasn\u2019t even a murmur as May shuffled into a half-empty chamber \u2013 most Tory MPs were off getting their picture taken with Boris Johnson: it would always be nice to have a record of his future betrayal for the scrapbook \u2013 and took her seat alongside the chancellor. One of the few members of the cabinet still capable of looking her in the eye. It\u2019s curious that the man who is among the most loyal is the one with most reason not to trust her. Had May won the 2017 general election Philip Hammond would have been out of a job two years ago. Perhaps he takes pleasure in watching her decline at first hand. He\u2019ll outlast her for sure. If only by a matter of hours.</p> <p>In recent weeks Jeremy Corbyn has steered clear of mentioning Brexit at prime minister\u2019s questions. Largely because Labour\u2019s own Brexit position can\u2019t survive much scrutiny. But with Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt trying to outcompete with one another to prove who is the most clinically insane, not even the Labour leader could pass up the opportunity of an open goal.</p> <p>Corbyn kept it simple. The chancellor had said a no-deal Brexit would cost the country \u00a390bn. Johnson had claimed that was confected hysteria. Which of them was right? Something inside May snapped. After years of speaking in semi-detached, meaningless binary, the Maybot finally got in touch with her anger. But it had been repressed so long that it came out hopelessly misdirected.</p> <p>I had a deal, she snarled. It might have been a crap deal, but it was her deal. And if only Labour had voted for it then the UK would already have left the EU by now and she could have been prime minister for ever and ever. There was a moment\u2019s silence after this. No one had seen May come close to losing control in the Commons and needed time to process the madness.</p> <p>\u201cEr... fine,\u201d said Corbyn. But could she still answer his original question? No. She couldn\u2019t. \u201cI HAD A DEAL,\u201d she yelled, spit flecking around her mouth. \u201cI HAD A DEAL AND IF LABOUR HAD VOTED FOR IT I WOULD STILL BE QUEEN.\u201d The Labour leader tried to talk her down. This was the way parliament worked. The government governed and the opposition opposed.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s been a busy few days for the prime minister. The weekend in Japan for the G20 summit and then a couple of days in Brussels while the other EU countries divvied up the top jobs between them. But everywhere Theresa May went she was treated with polite indifference. A ghost at the wedding. The louder she yells for some kind of legacy by which she can be remembered \u2013 even a photo opportunity with a minor dignitary would do \u2013 the less she is heard. So rapidly is she being airbrushed out of her life, not even she is entirely certain she really exists. There wasn\u2019t even a murmur as May shuffled into a half-empty chamber \u2013 most Tory MPs were off getting their picture taken with Boris Johnson: it would always be nice to have a record of his future betrayal for the scrapbook \u2013 and took her seat alongside the chancellor. One of the few members of the cabinet still capable of looking her in the eye. It\u2019s curious that the man who is among the most loyal is the one with most reason not to trust her. Had May won the 2017 general election Philip Hammond would have been out of a job two years ago. Perhaps he takes pleasure in watching her decline at first hand. He\u2019ll outlast her for sure. If only by a matter of hours. In recent weeks Jeremy Corbyn has steered clear of mentioning Brexit at prime minister\u2019s questions. Largely because Labour\u2019s own Brexit position can\u2019t survive much scrutiny. But with Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt trying to outcompete with one another to prove who is the most clinically insane, not even the Labour leader could pass up the opportunity of an open goal. Corbyn kept it simple. The chancellor had said a no-deal Brexit would cost the country \u00a390bn. Johnson had claimed that was confected hysteria. Which of them was right? Something inside May snapped. After years of speaking in semi-detached, meaningless binary, the Maybot finally got in touch with her anger. But it had been repressed so long that it came out hopelessly misdirected. I had a deal, she snarled. It might have been a crap deal, but it was her deal. And if only Labour had voted for it then the UK would already have left the EU by now and she could have been prime minister for ever and ever. There was a moment\u2019s silence after this. No one had seen May come close to losing control in the Commons and needed time to process the madness. \u201cEr... fine,\u201d said Corbyn. But could she still answer his original question? No. She couldn\u2019t. \u201cI HAD A DEAL,\u201d she yelled, spit flecking around her mouth. \u201cI HAD A DEAL AND IF LABOUR HAD VOTED FOR IT I WOULD STILL BE QUEEN.\u201d The Labour leader tried to talk her down. This was the way parliament worked. The government governed and the opposition opposed. So the reason her deal had not got through three times wasn\u2019t just because it was a bit rubbish \u2013 if it had been any good Labour might have given it the OK \u2013 but because her own backbenchers had voted against it. This still didn\u2019t compute with the Maybot. No matter how clearly it was spelled out to her, she couldn\u2019t get her head around the fact it had been her own party that had let her down. The level of denial was still just too great. Corbyn even mentioned the fact that Labour had put forward a motion to take no deal off the table that she had voted against, but this only provoked further confusion. \u201cYou\u2019re all mouth and trousers,\u201d May said.

Although a lawyer by professional background, Lagarde could be helped by the political experience she has gained through stints at the IMF and as France\u2019s finance minister. Presiding over the ECB, whose responsibilities include setting the eurozone interest rate and ensuring the stability of the banking system, is viewed as a tough task given the requirement to oversee 19 eurozone economies.</p> <p>Lagarde arrives with several challenges facing the ECB. Here are the key issues she must address:</p> <h2><strong>Reboot growth in the eurozone</strong></h2> <p>Financial markets across Europe have rallied on the news of her nomination, with investors viewing her as a continuity candidate who is not likely to ditch Draghi\u2019s policies supporting economic growth.</p> <p>Eurozone growth was a healthy 0.4% in the first quarter of the the year. But the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/02/trade-wars-could-shipwreck-global-economy-warns-mark-carney\">US-China trade war</a> has dragged down international trade volumes, which has had a knock-on affect in export-intensive industries of Europe such as the German carmakers.</p> <p>While Lagarde has no central bank experience for investors to pore over for clues on her monetary policy stance, her speeches at the IMF have typically favoured dovish policies, meaning an inclination to keep interest rates low. Hawks, in contrast, favour higher borrowing costs to combat inflationary pressures.</p> <p>Lagarde will have little firepower at her disposal to reboot the eurozone economy. Interest rates are already at record lows of zero and -0.4% for bank deposits. However, she could take the main interest rate into negative territory or deploy more unconventional policies, such as expanding quantitative easing \u2013 the buying of government bonds from banks.</p> <h2><strong>Keep the eurozone together</strong></h2> <p>The eurozone remains an unfinished monetary and political union, suffering from deep divisions between member states over the appropriate level of centralisation.</p> <p>Her political connections could help prod EU governments towards using more tax and spending measures to stimulate the eurozone economy, which the central bank has been arguing for without much success.</p> <p>Lagarde will need to keep an eye on Italy, where economic growth is weak and government debt high. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/05/eu-could-fine-italy-3bn-for-breaking-spending-and-borrowing-rules\">Rome has had repeated rows with Brussels</a> over its budget. The prospect of eurosceptic movements pushing to leave the single currency could send markets into a tailspin, requiring swift reaction from the central bank.</p> <p>She has comprehensive experience of the eurozone debt crisis from her time at the IMF, overseeing the bailouts of Greece and other nations struggling at the time. She also backed Draghi after he pledged to do \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/26/euro-irreversible-mario-draghi-ecb\">whatever it takes</a>\u201d to keep the euro from breaking apart in 2012.</p> <h2><strong>Display independence</strong></h2> <p>The ECB\u2019s political independence is enshrined in an EU treaty. However, Lagarde\u2019s previous role in French politics brings this sharply into question and also comes as the principle of central bank independence is challenged elsewhere around the world.</p> <p>With Spain\u2019s former finance minister Luis de Guindos as vice-president of the ECB, two former politicians will hold the top jobs, an institution more traditionally dominated by technocrats.</p> <p>Financial markets could be rattled if investors believe nation states could apply pressure over monetary policy decisions, similar to the concerns over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> applying pressure at the US Federal Reserve. Jerome Powell, who leads the American central bank, has had to reassure markets of his independence.</p> <p>That Lagarde is not a trained economist means she may need to rely more on ECB staff and technical members of its governing council. The appointment of Philip Lane, the former Irish central bank governor, as chief economist will help her in this regard.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Christine Lagarde\u2019s nomination as the next president of the European Central Bank was not widely expected. If confirmed as Mario Draghi\u2019s replacement, the head of the International Monetary Fund would be the first ECB president without any direct experience of setting central bank policy. Although a lawyer by professional background, Lagarde could be helped by the political experience she has gained through stints at the IMF and as France\u2019s finance minister. Presiding over the ECB, whose responsibilities include setting the eurozone interest rate and ensuring the stability of the banking system, is viewed as a tough task given the requirement to oversee 19 eurozone economies. Lagarde arrives with several challenges facing the ECB. Here are the key issues she must address: Reboot growth in the eurozone Financial markets across Europe have rallied on the news of her nomination, with investors viewing her as a continuity candidate who is not likely to ditch Draghi\u2019s policies supporting economic growth. Eurozone growth was a healthy 0.4% in the first quarter of the the year. But the US-China trade war has dragged down international trade volumes, which has had a knock-on affect in export-intensive industries of Europe such as the German carmakers. While Lagarde has no central bank experience for investors to pore over for clues on her monetary policy stance, her speeches at the IMF have typically favoured dovish policies, meaning an inclination to keep interest rates low. Hawks, in contrast, favour higher borrowing costs to combat inflationary pressures. Lagarde will have little firepower at her disposal to reboot the eurozone economy. Interest rates are already at record lows of zero and -0.4% for bank deposits. However, she could take the main interest rate into negative territory or deploy more unconventional policies, such as expanding quantitative easing \u2013 the buying of government bonds from banks. Keep the eurozone together The eurozone remains an unfinished monetary and political union, suffering from deep divisions between member states over the appropriate level of centralisation. Her political connections could help prod EU governments towards using more tax and spending measures to stimulate the eurozone economy, which the central bank has been arguing for without much success. Lagarde will need to keep an eye on Italy, where economic growth is weak and government debt high. Rome has had repeated rows with Brussels over its budget. The prospect of eurosceptic movements pushing to leave the single currency could send markets into a tailspin, requiring swift reaction from the central bank. She has comprehensive experience of the eurozone debt crisis from her time at the IMF, overseeing the bailouts of Greece and other nations struggling at the time. She also backed Draghi after he pledged to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to keep the euro from breaking apart in 2012. Display independence The ECB\u2019s political independence is enshrined in an EU treaty. However, Lagarde\u2019s previous role in French politics brings this sharply into question and also comes as the principle of central bank independence is challenged elsewhere around the world. With Spain\u2019s former finance minister Luis de Guindos as vice-president of the ECB, two former politicians will hold the top jobs, an institution more traditionally dominated by technocrats. Financial markets could be rattled if investors believe nation states could apply pressure over monetary policy decisions, similar to the concerns over Donald Trump applying pressure at the US Federal Reserve. Jerome Powell, who leads the American central bank, has had to reassure markets of his independence. That Lagarde is not a trained economist means she may need to rely more on ECB staff and technical members of its governing council. The appointment of Philip Lane, the former Irish central bank governor, as chief economist will help her in this regard.",

      "bodyText": "Government MPs have revived the possibility of extending parliamentary terms to four years, with the perennial issue raised in the Coalition\u2019s party room meeting this week. Rowan Ramsey, the government whip, told Coalition MPs in Canberra that they should rally behind the idea of extending the term of parliament from three to four years, bringing the commonwealth in line with most of the states and territories. Doing so would require changing the constitution which can only be achieved via a referendum, a point made clear by special minister of state, Mathias Cormann. But Ramsey told Guardian Australia he believed there was popular support among the public for voting less often, and believed change could be achieved if the proposal had bipartisan support and was put to the public at the next election. \u201cI raised it because I thought it was a reasonable idea and I would hope that we could build some kind of consensus on it, in conjunction with the opposition,\u201d Ramsey told Guardian Australia. \u201cYou would only do it if it had the support of the two major parties, and you could do it at the next election. \u201cIf everybody was on board, I think it would get up.\u201d He suggested the extended term would not necessarily apply to the next term of government, saying it could be a longer-term proposition. The idea of four-year terms last gained currency when then opposition leader Bill Shorten called in 2017 for a joint movement to extend parliamentary terms to four years, an idea that won support from Malcolm Turnbull at the time. Shorten said the change would create certainty and allow for bold policy changes. \u201cGovernments can be more daring and more determined if they\u2019re not constantly thinking about the next election,\u201d Shorten told the ABC\u2019s Insiders program. \u201cWhat this country needs is long-term policymaking, over the cycle of polls and two-and-a-half-year cycles.\u201d But the debate over extending Australia\u2019s parliamentary has been debated for decades, and was put to a referendum in 1988. At the time voters were asked whether they wanted to \u201calter the constitution to provide for four-year maximum terms for members of both houses of the commonwealth parliament\u201d, but less than 33% of voters supported the idea and there was no majority yes vote in any state. A report found that while there was support for increased federal parliamentary terms, the proposal was defeated because it was combined with other contentious proposals, including a reduction in the Senate term to four years. Kevin Rudd also promised a referendum on extending the term of federal MPs in 2007, but this did not happen. Under the current system, election dates are variable, but must be held within three years from when parliament first sat after the election. The average length is around two-and-a-half years. A major stumbling block for the reform is what happens to the Senate, which currently has six-year terms, subject to half-Senate elections every three years. Options to address this include eight-year Senate terms, while maintaining half-Senate elections, or four-year terms with a full Senate vote at the time of each federal election. According to the University of Melbourne\u2019s Election Watch project, Australia is an international outlier, with four- to five-year terms the norm in most democratic systems.",

It is especially inaccurate and prone to bias when used against people of colour: <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/blog/privacy-technology/surveillance-technologies/amazons-face-recognition-falsely-matched-28\">a test of Amazon\u2019s facial recognition software</a> found that it falsely identified 28 members of US Congress as known criminals, with members of the Congressional Black Caucus disproportionately represented.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>David Davis MP, a former shadow home secretary, said the research by Prof Peter Fussey and Dr Daragh Murray at the University of Essex\u2019s Human Rights Centre showed the technology \u201ccould lead to miscarriages of justice and wrongful arrests\u201d and poses \u201cmassive issues for democracy\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cAll experiments like this should now be suspended until we have a proper chance to debate this and establish some laws and regulations,\u201d he said. \u201cRemember what these rights are: freedom of association and freedom to protest; rights which we have assumed for centuries which shouldn\u2019t be intruded upon without a good reason.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Neoface system used by the Met and South Wales police is supplied by Japanese company NEC, which markets the same technology to retailers and casinos to spot regular customers, and to stadium and concert operators to scan crowds for \u201cpotential troublemakers\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/09/the-guardian-view-on-facial-recognition-a-danger-to-democracy\">The Guardian view on facial recognition: a danger to democracy | Editorial</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Scotland Yard insisted its deployments were legal and successful in identifying wanted offenders, and that the public would expect it to trial emerging technology.</p> \n<p>Deputy assistant commissioner Duncan Ball said the force was \u201cextremely disappointed with the negative and unbalanced tone of this report\u201d.</p> \n<p>The study will increase pressure on ministers to legislate to define how facial recognition can be used in policing and in the private sector. Its use by South Wales police is currently under judicial review, while the information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, has criticised \u201ca lack of transparency about its use\u201d and Tony Porter, the surveillance camera commissioner, last year intervened to stop Greater Manchester police using facial recognition at the Trafford shopping centre.</p> \n<p>The Home Office said it believed there was an adequate legal framework for its use and it supported police trials, but added it was reviewing ways to simplify and extend governance and oversight of biometrics.</p> \n<p>Scotland Yard granted the University of Essex academics access to six deployments of the system between June 2018 and February 2019. It uses cameras fixed to posts or on a van, and software cross-checks face-scans of passersby against a \u201cwatchlist\u201d.</p> \n<p>The research found that police were too hasty to stop people before matches could be properly checked, which led to mistakes; watchlists were sometimes out of date and included people wanted by the courts as well as those considered \u201cat risk or vulnerable\u201d; and officers viewed the technology as a way of detecting and deterring crime, which the report argued could have been achieved without biometric technology. They said it was \u201chighly possible\u201d Scotland Yard\u2019s use would be ruled unlawful if challenged in court.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhile we focused on the police, by far the greater use is in the private sphere,\u201d said Professor Fussey. \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of any national leadership on this issue of facial recognition. Human rights standards should be embedded from the start in the use of technology.\u201d</p> \n<p>Of 42 people flagged up during the Met\u2019s trials, 22 people were stopped, but of those only eight were being sought \u2013 some of whom were wanted for serious violent crime. Some were stopped for a crime the courts had already dealt with, but were arrested for a more minor offence that would not normally be considered serious enough to be tackled using facial recognition.</p> \n<p>The Essex researchers also raised concern about potential bias, citing <a href=\"http://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a/buolamwini18a.pdf\">US research</a> in 2018 into facial recognition software provided by IBM, Microsoft and Face++, a China-based company, which found the programmes were most likely to wrongly identify dark-skinned women and most likely to correctly identify light-skinned men.</p> \n<p>In future, facial recognition software could screen images from body worn cameras and existing CCTV cameras, they said. This could allow a record of an individual\u2019s movements, which could be analysed automatically to identify \u201cunusual patterns of movement, participation at specific events, or meetings with particular people\u201d.</p> \n<p>Liberty, the civil rights campaign group, has previously called facial recognition \u201ca dangerously intrusive and discriminatory technology that destroys our privacy rights and forces people to change their behaviour\u201d.</p>",

Academics from the University of Essex were granted access to six live trials by the Metropolitan police in Soho, Romford and at the Westfield shopping centre in Stratford, east London. They found the system regularly misidentified people who were then wrongly stopped. They also warned of \u201csurveillance creep\u201d, with the technology being used to find people who were not wanted by the courts. And they warned it was unlikely to be justifiable under human rights law, which protects privacy, freedom of expression and the right to protest. Similar facial scanning software is being used in shopping centres, where it is embedded in advertising hoardings to track the shoppers\u2019 age, gender and even mood, and has been deployed by other police forces in Manchester, Leicester and South Wales \u2013 where it will be used this weekend at the Swansea airshow. Officers will be scanning for \u201cpersons of interest\u201d and \u201cother persons where intelligence is required\u201d as well as wanted criminals, the force said. David Davis MP, a former shadow home secretary, said the research by Prof Peter Fussey and Dr Daragh Murray at the University of Essex\u2019s Human Rights Centre showed the technology \u201ccould lead to miscarriages of justice and wrongful arrests\u201d and poses \u201cmassive issues for democracy\u201d. \u201cAll experiments like this should now be suspended until we have a proper chance to debate this and establish some laws and regulations,\u201d he said. \u201cRemember what these rights are: freedom of association and freedom to protest; rights which we have assumed for centuries which shouldn\u2019t be intruded upon without a good reason.\u201d The Neoface system used by the Met and South Wales police is supplied by Japanese company NEC, which markets the same technology to retailers and casinos to spot regular customers, and to stadium and concert operators to scan crowds for \u201cpotential troublemakers\u201d. Scotland Yard insisted its deployments were legal and successful in identifying wanted offenders, and that the public would expect it to trial emerging technology. Deputy assistant commissioner Duncan Ball said the force was \u201cextremely disappointed with the negative and unbalanced tone of this report\u201d. The study will increase pressure on ministers to legislate to define how facial recognition can be used in policing and in the private sector. Its use by South Wales police is currently under judicial review, while the information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, has criticised \u201ca lack of transparency about its use\u201d and Tony Porter, the surveillance camera commissioner, last year intervened to stop Greater Manchester police using facial recognition at the Trafford shopping centre. The Home Office said it believed there was an adequate legal framework for its use and it supported police trials, but added it was reviewing ways to simplify and extend governance and oversight of biometrics. Scotland Yard granted the University of Essex academics access to six deployments of the system between June 2018 and February 2019. It uses cameras fixed to posts or on a van, and software cross-checks face-scans of passersby against a \u201cwatchlist\u201d. The research found that police were too hasty to stop people before matches could be properly checked, which led to mistakes; watchlists were sometimes out of date and included people wanted by the courts as well as those considered \u201cat risk or vulnerable\u201d; and officers viewed the technology as a way of detecting and deterring crime, which the report argued could have been achieved without biometric technology. They said it was \u201chighly possible\u201d Scotland Yard\u2019s use would be ruled unlawful if challenged in court. \u201cWhile we focused on the police, by far the greater use is in the private sphere,\u201d said Professor Fussey. \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of any national leadership on this issue of facial recognition. Human rights standards should be embedded from the start in the use of technology.\u201d Of 42 people flagged up during the Met\u2019s trials, 22 people were stopped, but of those only eight were being sought \u2013 some of whom were wanted for serious violent crime. Some were stopped for a crime the courts had already dealt with, but were arrested for a more minor offence that would not normally be considered serious enough to be tackled using facial recognition. The Essex researchers also raised concern about potential bias, citing US research in 2018 into facial recognition software provided by IBM, Microsoft and Face++, a China-based company, which found the programmes were most likely to wrongly identify dark-skinned women and most likely to correctly identify light-skinned men. In future, facial recognition software could screen images from body worn cameras and existing CCTV cameras, they said. This could allow a record of an individual\u2019s movements, which could be analysed automatically to identify \u201cunusual patterns of movement, participation at specific events, or meetings with particular people\u201d. Liberty, the civil rights campaign group, has previously called facial recognition \u201ca dangerously intrusive and discriminatory technology that destroys our privacy rights and forces people to change their behaviour\u201d.",

Last month the supreme court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/21/spanish-supreme-court-finds-wolf-pack-men-guilty-of-rape\">increased their sentences from nine to 15 years</a>, ruling that they had committed rape.</p> <p>The original verdict caused outrage when the three judges concluded that the victim, 18, who had only met her attackers 20 minutes before the assault, did not resist and was therefore complicit. The supreme court ruled she was simply too terrified to fight back.</p> <p>The accused in the Manresa case have all denied having sexual relations with the victim, although sperm from one of them was found on her clothing. On the opening day of the trial in Barcelona on Wednesday, one said: \u201cI don\u2019t know how that could have got there, she must have sat on something.\u201d</p> <p>The prosecution alleges the six men sexually abused the girl on 29 October 2016 in an abandoned factory. A seventh man is accused of masturbating while watching and faces 18 months for failing to help her.</p> <p>The prosecution was reported to be considering increasing the charge to rape, depending on the victim\u2019s testimony.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/23/wolf-pack-case-spain-feminism-far-right-vox\">The shocking rape trial that galvanised Spain\u2019s feminists \u2013 and the far right</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is alleged that one of the accused took the girl, who was drunk, into a shack where he sexually abused her. He then invited the others to do likewise, telling them they were only allowed 15 minutes each. </p> <p>In what appears to be a re-run of the Pamplona case, the prosecution claims that, while there was no consent, there was no violence or intimidation either, so the offence could not be considered rape, even though the victim was in no state to resist.

      "bodyText": "Prosecutors in the trial of six young men accused over an attack on a 14-year-old girl in the Spanish town of Manresa have argued they should face the lesser charge of sexual abuse instead of rape because the girl was drunk, under the influence of drugs and did not fight back. The trial has been labelled the Manresa Manada after the notorious case of five men who called themselves La Manada, \u201cthe wolf pack\u201d, who were accused of raping a teenager in Pamplona but were initially found guilty of the lesser offence of sexual abuse. Last month the supreme court increased their sentences from nine to 15 years, ruling that they had committed rape. The original verdict caused outrage when the three judges concluded that the victim, 18, who had only met her attackers 20 minutes before the assault, did not resist and was therefore complicit. The supreme court ruled she was simply too terrified to fight back. The accused in the Manresa case have all denied having sexual relations with the victim, although sperm from one of them was found on her clothing. On the opening day of the trial in Barcelona on Wednesday, one said: \u201cI don\u2019t know how that could have got there, she must have sat on something.\u201d The prosecution alleges the six men sexually abused the girl on 29 October 2016 in an abandoned factory. A seventh man is accused of masturbating while watching and faces 18 months for failing to help her. The prosecution was reported to be considering increasing the charge to rape, depending on the victim\u2019s testimony. It is alleged that one of the accused took the girl, who was drunk, into a shack where he sexually abused her. He then invited the others to do likewise, telling them they were only allowed 15 minutes each. In what appears to be a re-run of the Pamplona case, the prosecution claims that, while there was no consent, there was no violence or intimidation either, so the offence could not be considered rape, even though the victim was in no state to resist. The charge of sexual abuse carries a maximum sentence of 12 years. The victim\u2019s lawyers claim that the girl was intimidated and are demanding a sentence of 15 to 20 years. In the supreme court ruling in the Pamplona case last month, the judges cited what they called \u201ccontextual intimidation\u201d in which the victim was dragged into a hallway and outnumbered by five men. The case has led to calls for changes to the law relating to rape and sexual abuse. Spain\u2019s socialist government has proposed changing the law on consent to be: yes means yes. Anything else, including silence, would be interpreted as no. Wednesday\u2019s court session was adjourned early because of a death in the family of one of the lawyers. As the accused were led from court police had to restrain an uncle of the victim who tried to attack one of them and later told reporters: \u201cShe\u2019s not well and she thinks she\u2019s going to be killed.\u201d The victim will testify on Monday and a friend who accompanied her on the night in question is due to testify in the next few days. \u2022This article was amended on 4 July 2019 to correct a quote from an uncle of the victim.",

But not many cared to look, and congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was mocked when she claimed that \u201cconcentration camps\u201d were being run along the border. In the past few days, however, a series of exposures has demonstrated that extreme language is more than justified.</p> <p>First, Ocasio-Cortez and a congressional delegation visited two detention facilities in Texas, where they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/01/aoc-border-facility-horrifying-cbp-officers-tweets\" title=\"\">found detainees</a> who hadn\u2019t bathed in weeks, were sleeping on concrete floors and had limited access to drinking water. Ocasio-Cortez <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1145801283191955464?s=20\" title=\"\">met with women</a> crying \u201cout of fear of being punished, out of sickness, out of desperation, lack of sleep, trauma, despair\u201d. She said women had been encouraged to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1145837522355924992\" title=\"\">drink out of toilet bowls</a> and that Border Patrol agents were laughing about the situation in front of the delegation.</p> <p>Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s statements were pounced on by conservatives, who accused her of exaggerating conditions. Rush Limbaugh said she had made \u201cbaseless charges\u201d and was pulling a \u201cstunt\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/officials-push-back-on-aocs-claims-say-she-is-intentionally-misinforming-the-public\" title=\"\">Immigration officials</a> accused her of misinforming the public. But <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6178541-FinalDocumentsRedacted.html\" title=\"\">documents released</a> this week by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) inspector general were if anything even more disturbing. She found \u201cdangerous overcrowding\u201d in \u201ccells designed for about one-fifth as many detainees\u201d, and that \u201cchildren at three of the five border patrol facilities we visited had no access to showers\u201d.</p> <p>Inspectors said the cells \u201csmelled of what might have been unwashed bodies/body odour, urine, untreated diarrhea, and/or soiled clothing/diapers\u201d, had no room to lie down and were at a temperature of over 80F (27C). At one facility adults were held in standing-room-only conditions for a week, and detainees\u2019 personal property was \u201cdiscarded in a dumpster behind the station\u201d. The reports were accompanied by <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/hamedaleaziz/photos-overcrowding-immigration-border-facilities\" title=\"\">shocking photos</a>.</p> <p>Then there were the Facebook posts. A <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/secret-border-patrol-facebook-group-agents-joke-about-migrant-deaths-post-sexist-memes\" title=\"\">ProPublica investigation</a> reported a closed Facebook group for current and former Border Patrol agents engaging in sexist and xenophobic language, photoshopping Ocasio-Cortez into scenes of sexual assault, joking about putting migrant children in <a href=\"https://assets.propublica.org/images/articles/_threeTwo2000w/20190701-border-patrol-facebook-reaction-plastic-bag-comment.jpg\" title=\"\">trash bags</a> and responding \u201cwith indifference and wisecracks\u201d to stories of migrants who had died in custody. It would not be surprising that an agency charged with a fundamentally dehumanising mission would have a dehumanising internal culture, but ProPublica\u2019s reporting seemed to demonstrate the kind of callous indifference to human life that is normalised among agents.</p> <p>None of this is new \u2013 demeaning and unsanitary conditions in border cells were <a href=\"https://www.acluaz.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/doe_v_johnson_complaint_0.pdf\" title=\"\">well-documented</a> during the Obama administration.

The DHS has been crying out that it is \u201cunder-resourced\u201d and thus unable to release people swiftly from these border cells, which are intended to be used for a maximum of only three days. It will try to use the public\u2019s outrage over conditions in the cells to make other forms of longer-term detention \u2013 in family detention centres and immigration jails \u2013 seem like humane alternatives.</p> <p>The DHS has already attempted to blame the long waits in short-term Border Patrol facilities on the fact there are not enough beds in the longer-term Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities. That\u2019s almost certainly a disingenuous justification because there\u2019s evidence ICE isn\u2019t nearly as overstretched as it claims. (The largest family detention centre has consistently had hundreds of <a href=\"https://psmag.com/news/ices-largest-family-detention-center-is-well-below-capacity\" title=\"\">empty beds</a> this year.) But by talking about this as a resources issue, the DHS will try to convince people that the problem is a lack of adequate facilities in which to detain people rather than the overuse of detention itself. With poor oversight of Border Patrol operations, increasingly prolonged detention periods for migrants will become normalised, leading to people being tortured for weeks instead of days, and then months instead of weeks.</p> <p>The Trump administration doesn\u2019t necessarily mind people pointing out that conditions are squalid and appalling. Why? Because that helps it make the case for building more jails. Democrats can very easily fall into the trap of making the right\u2019s own argument for it.

For example, the Trump administration has recently been expanding its new \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d programme. Under this policy asylum-seekers are forced to remain in dangerous Mexican border towns rather than being allowed entry to the US.

      "bodyText": "Shocking as the precise circumstances are behind the deaths of at least 44 people in an airstrike that hit a detention centre in Tajoura in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, it is a predictable incident. Even as footage circulated online claiming to show blood and body parts mixed with rubble and migrants\u2019 belongings from the air raid blamed on the forces of the warlord Khalifa Haftar, it emerged the detainees had been housed in a hangar next to a weapons store \u2013 the likely target of the strike. EU officials have long been aware of the risks in Libya, where migrants have faced atrocious mistreatment at the hands of militias, while Europe\u2019s governments have prevented the sailing of migrant boats to Italy and elsewhere. Critics point to the EU\u2019s decision to withdraw the naval assets involved in Operation Sophia, which provided a vital role in saving lives at sea, saying this has led to thousands more people being detained or trapped in facilities such as the one in Tajoura. In recent months, since Haftar and his self-styled National Liberation Forces launched their assault on the UN-backed government of Fayez al-Sarraj in Tripoli, alarm bells over the safety of migrants had only grown louder. About 3,000 are housed in locations close to the fighting where migrants have already been killed. In the case of the Tajoura facility, the UN\u2019s refugee agency, the UNHCR, noted it had warned less than two months ago that anyone inside the detention centre was at risk of being caught in the fighting around Tripoli. Amnesty had also warned of the risk of detaining migrants close to a military site after an airstrike hit a military vehicle about 100 metres from the detention centre on 7 May. Last month, it was the turn of the UN\u2019s office of the high commissioner for human rights, whose spokesman, Rupert Colville, outlined a litany of abuses and dangers facing migrants detained in Libya, often after being intercepted by the EU-supported Libyan coastguard. Among the abuses Colville listed were reports of detainees dying untreated from tuberculosis in \u201cghastly conditions\u201d, including 22 people in the Zintan facility south of Tripoli since September. Some, Colville said, appeared to have been sent deliberately to facilities close to the frontline, while others still had simply disappeared amid suspicions they had been trafficked after their detention into forced labour, for sexual exploitation or passed on again to smugglers offering transit to Europe. As the New York-based organisation Human Rights Watch made clear in a scathing report published in January titled No Escape from Hell, none of this should come as much of a surprise to officials. Two years ago, the EU\u2019s migration commissioner, Dimitris Avramopoulos, was compelled to acknowledge the shocking state of the detention centres in Libya and the widespread abuses, even as the bloc continued to support the anti-migration efforts at sea of Libyan authorities. \u201cWe are all conscious of the appalling and degrading conditions in which some migrants are held in Libya,\u201d said Avramopoulos, conditions that have barely improved while the risks to those held in them have mounted. In July 2018, when Human Rights Watch researchers visited four detention centres in Tripoli, Misrata and Zuwara, they documented what they described as \u201cinhumane conditions that included severe overcrowding, unsanitary conditions, poor quality food and water\u201d, as well as \u201cdisturbing accounts of violence by guards, including beatings, whippings and use of electric shocks\u201d. Commenting in the aftermath of the airstrike, Elinor Raikes of the International Rescue Committee called for detention centres to be evacuated. \u201cThis devastating development is a testament to the immense vulnerability of the refugees and migrants who remain trapped inside detention centres across Libya,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fear and horror felt by those trapped in Tajoura and across Libya is unimaginable. People caught in detention centres must be evacuated to a place of safety outside Libya and search and rescue operations at sea immediately restored to protect those fleeing the violence. \u201cA ceasefire is urgently needed.

      "bodyText": "Irish authorities are preparing to charge a man for the murder of Denis Donaldson, a British spy within the IRA who was shot dead in 2006. The news emerged on Wednesday when an Irish police officer told an inquest in Letterkenny, County Donegal, that prosecutors had obtained a warrant to arrest and charge the suspect with murder. Donaldson operated at the heart of the IRA and Sinn F\u00e9in for decades and was a confidant of Gerry Adams until being outed as an MI5 agent in 2005, causing major embarrassment for the republican movement. Originally from Belfast, after his exposure Donaldson moved to an isolated cottage near Glenties, Co Donegal, in the Republic of Ireland. The 55-year-old was shot dead with a shotgun there in April 2006. The Real IRA, a dissident group opposed to the peace process, admitted responsibility but there is speculation the mainstream IRA may have committed the murder. After more than 20 postponements, the inquest heard on Wednesday that Irish authorities were moving to charge the alleged killer. Previously there have been arrests but no charges. Garda Supt Michael Finan said the the director of public prosecutions had instituted proceedings. \u201cA warrant has recently been obtained from the special criminal court for the arrest of an individual for the purpose of taking him before that court, where he is to be charged with Mr Donaldson\u2019s murder.\u201d The coroner, Denis McCauley, adjourned the inquest until September 2020 to allow criminal proceedings to progress. Ciaran Shiels, a solicitor for the Donaldson family, said the suspect was serving a prison sentence outside the country and it would be at least a decade before he could be extradited, according to the news site Donegal Daily. Before being exposed, Donaldson was a prominent figure in Sinn F\u00e9in and ran the party\u2019s administrative team at the Stormont parliament in Belfast. As a renowned fixer for the republican movement\u2019s leadership, he sidelined awkward or rebellious candidates and replaced them with people who toed the party line. Donaldson also headed international relations for Sinn F\u00e9in and spent time in the Middle East meeting Palestinian factions and Hezbollah in Lebanon, all the while working for British intelligence. In 2005 he confessed publicly to working for the Royal Ulster Constabulary special branch as well as other branches of the security forces.",

      "bodyText": "When I was a child during the second world war, British men and women laid down their lives for us. Would they have thought that nearly 80 years later, their descendants would be asked to lay down their jobs for the country (Businesses going bust is price worth paying for no-deal Brexit, says Hunt, 1 July)? My only hope is that the ragbag advocating this sacrifice will be giving us personal examples of such fortitude. Isobel Waddington York \u2022 Can anyone explain just what is so truly awful about the EU that any price is, apparently, worth paying to get out of it? Surely the Tory party is entitled to go mad. It has no right to inflict its lunacy on the rest of us. As parties to this madness, both Johnson and Hunt are evidently unfit to hold the office to which they aspire. Perhaps the best way forward would be for Mrs May to call a general election now. Roy Boffy Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands \u2022 Jeremy Hunt says a no-deal Brexit is necessary to maintain the UK\u2019s image abroad as \u201ca country where politicians do what the people tell them to do\u201d. But the people have never requested what he is proposing. Many wanted a strong economy with \u00a3350m a week extra spending on the NHS (and with no extra borrowing). What are politicians doing about that? And that was three long years ago. Why are he and his colleagues now so patently sticking fingers in their ears, seemingly so afraid to ask the people what they want politicians to do now? Paolo Gordon Teddington, London \u2022 Jeremy Hunt proposes to create a \u00a36bn fund for the fishing and farming sectors, arguing that \u201cif we [bailed out] the bankers then why wouldn\u2019t we do it \u2026 for our fishermen and farmers now\u201d? I thought one of the reasons for leaving the EU was that it would hugely benefit the fishing and farming industries. Why do they need to be recompensed for a decision that was supposedly taken in their interests? Matthew Taylor Hove, East Sussex \u2022 The bailout of the banks was followed by 10 years of austerity, huge damage to the NHS, and a marked increase in inequality. Also, subsidising exporters will certainly spark trade wars. Will somebody now ask Mr Hunt (and Mr Johnson) exactly what material advantage is envisaged as flowing from Brexit, to set against this cost? Roger Wilson Billingshurst, West Sussex \u2022 Polly Toynbee is painfully right (Hunt seemed the sensible option. No longer, 2 July). This increasingly phoney contest has come down to a choice between Sir Toby Belch Johnson and Sir Andrew Aguecheek Hunt. At least Shakespeare knew that the right place for these buffoons was in a comic subplot. We should be so lucky. Tim Brassell Thame, Oxfordshire \u2022 Thanks to Polly Toynbee for reminding us of Jeremy Hunt\u2019s track record (and there wasn\u2019t even space to mention his association with the notorious book advocating privatisation of the health service).

As we were effectively waiting for crucial information to assist our valuations, any figures used in any professional capacity cannot be endorsed by HVS.\u201d</p> <p>A NPD spokesman said: \u201cWe engaged HVS to produce independent valuations of our properties. We strenuously deny any wrongdoing.</p> <p>\u201cWe regret that Peter Moore has resigned. We can assure all concerned that we remain as committed as ever to delivering the Afan Valley project.\u201d</p> <p>NPD\u2019s accountants, Williamson &amp; Croft, did not comment.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Two of the most senior advisers to Northern Powerhouse Developments, the company owned by embattled financier Gavin Woodhouse, have quit the business in the wake of a series of allegations about its finances. The departures have emerged a week after publication of an undercover investigation by the Guardian and ITV News, which raised questions about the business interests of Woodhouse, who has raised millions from private investors but whose firms have a multimillion-pound \u201cblack hole\u201d. Peter Moore, who helped launch Center Parcs in the UK and was NPD\u2019s non-executive chairman of leisure, has quit after previously leading the development of Woodhouse\u2019s \u00a3200m Afan Valley adventure resort in south Wales, which is backed by the television presenter Bear Grylls. Moore said: \u201cI have resigned from NPD because recent allegations are causing understandable concern to many of the organisations involved in delivering the Afan Valley project.\u201d Russell Kett, the chairman of the London office of hospitality consultancy HVS and a special adviser to the NPD\u2019s board, has also resigned after claiming the group misused his \u201cdraft\u201d figures to increase the value of its assets by \u00a322m in its annual accounts. Kett said he was embarrassed and \u201cconcerned [his] professional integrity is being called into question\u201d. He said: \u201cI have therefore decided to terminate my relationship with NPD and to withdraw from my role as an adviser to the company\u201d. Northern Powerhouse Developments (Holdings) \u2013 the company behind the Afan Valley resort, as well as 11 operational hotels \u2013 posted a \u00a37m profit in the year to March 2018 and said its balance sheet had net assets of \u00a311.2m. Both figures would have been wiped out without a \u00a322m hike in the valuation of its hotels. The accounts, which were personally signed off by Woodhouse, state: \u201cAll hotels have been independently valued by HVS.\u201d However, in a statement issued to the Guardian and ITV News, Kett said: \u201cIn February 2018 the valuation division of HVS London issued a draft report on nine of NPD\u2019s hotels for their internal asset evaluation purposes only and to assist in their strategy initiatives; this was subject to a number of specific assumptions. \u201cA final version of this draft report was never issued because of outstanding information relevant to the valuation conclusions. As we were effectively waiting for crucial information to assist our valuations, any figures used in any professional capacity cannot be endorsed by HVS.\u201d A NPD spokesman said: \u201cWe engaged HVS to produce independent valuations of our properties. We strenuously deny any wrongdoing. \u201cWe regret that Peter Moore has resigned. We can assure all concerned that we remain as committed as ever to delivering the Afan Valley project.\u201d NPD\u2019s accountants, Williamson &amp; Croft, did not comment.",

A favourite work of Hitler\u2019s (he liked to hear it on birthdays), the Ninth was also used in Nazi propaganda films, and the closing choral section was performed at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. It was also chosen as the national anthem of the Republic of Rhodesia under the racist administration of Ian Smith. This darkness has been appropriated in film soundtracks: the symphony is associated with extreme violence in Stanley Kubrick\u2019s A Clockwork Orange, and is a recurring motif representing Alan Rickman\u2019s cultured villain Hans Gruber in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jul/12/die-hard-30th-anniversary-quintessential-action-movie\">Die Hard</a>.</p> \n<p>Yet the Ninth also has redemptive connotations. At the same time as Hitler appropriated the Ninth, it was also used to oppose him, even played in concentration camps by an orchestra of prisoners.

In 2000, the Vienna Philharmonic gave a moving performance of it <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/09/arts/arts-abroad-dissonance-shadow-death-beethoven-kaddish-echo-through-nazi-camp.html\">at Mauthausen, a Nazi concentration camp,</a> in front of an audience of survivors. Given its history (and also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/16/vienna-philharmonic-nazi-past\">that of the Vienna Philharmonic</a>), the choice of the Ninth was controversial. Nonetheless, Beethoven, as a symbol of the new Europe at the turn of the millennium, was seen as the appropriate choice by many people and the Ninth has been reclaimed as a powerful, sublime symbol of love and humanitarianism.

Beethoven\u2019s musical choices create drama. There are extreme contrasts of sound. There are frenzied bursts of activity and repeated rhythms that drive the music forward.

The Ninth is intimately associated with Europe as a single entity.</p> \n<p>Soon after his death, German-born Beethoven, who lived most of his adult life in Vienna, was claimed by Europe as a whole. Different traditions grew in European centres, where his symphonies were adapted to suit local tastes and customs. In England, for example, they were arranged as hymn tunes and heard in cathedrals and played by brass bands. Beethoven became part of our own musical vernacular as, simulataneously, he became part of other European musical traditions. He was also treated with reverence over and above any other composer. One particularly flamboyant French 19th-century conductor, Louis Jullien, donned white gloves and used a jewelled baton that was presented to him on a cushion every time he conducted Beethoven\u2019s symphonies.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4ab1d864fe381be4c6356df912cd440585f8b881\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ab1d864fe381be4c6356df912cd440585f8b881/0_150_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Claimed by Europe ... the Beethoven monument in Bonn, Germany.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Claimed by Europe ... the Beethoven monument in Bonn, Germany.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A statue of the composer was erected in Bonn, his birthplace, in 1845. The King of Prussia attended the unveiling, as did Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The British press was there in force, alongside the French and German press. There was some friction. The French contingent became annoyed because there was no toast to the absent King Louis Philippe. A group of European musicians and heads of state gathered in Vienna in 1927 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the composer\u2019s death and next year, the 250th anniversary of the composer\u2019s birth will be celebrated not only in Europe but around the world, so universal is Beethoven\u2019s appeal.</p> \n<p>The image of the Ninth as a powerful symbol of European unity was perhaps claimed in most iconic fashion on <a href=\"https://leonardbernstein.com/about/conductor/historic-concerts/berlin-wall-concert-1989\">Christmas day in 1989 when Leonard Bernstein</a> conducted the last movement of the Ninth to celebrate the fall of the Berlin wall with an orchestra consisting of members from East and West Germany as well as the four allied powers: France, Great Britain, the Soviet Union and the US.</p> \n<p>When, in 1972, the Council of Europe decided on its anthem, Beethoven was seen as the obvious choice. EU leaders then adopted the Ninth in 1985 as the official anthem of the European Union. Given, its meaning of unity and its long association with European history, it represented not only the EU, but also Europe in a wider sense.</p> \n<p>It is all of this (sometimes painful) shared history, as well as its joy and optimism for the future, that the Brexit Party MEPs reject when they shun the Ninth.</p> \n<p>\u2022<a href=\"https://twitter.com/joannecormac\">Dr Joanne Cormac</a> is a research fellow at the University of Nottingham. </p> \n<p><br></p>",

Different traditions grew in European centres, where his symphonies were adapted to suit local tastes and customs. In England, for example, they were arranged as hymn tunes and heard in cathedrals and played by brass bands. Beethoven became part of our own musical vernacular as, simulataneously, he became part of other European musical traditions. He was also treated with reverence over and above any other composer. One particularly flamboyant French 19th-century conductor, Louis Jullien, donned white gloves and used a jewelled baton that was presented to him on a cushion every time he conducted Beethoven\u2019s symphonies. A statue of the composer was erected in Bonn, his birthplace, in 1845. The King of Prussia attended the unveiling, as did Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The British press was there in force, alongside the French and German press. There was some friction. The French contingent became annoyed because there was no toast to the absent King Louis Philippe. A group of European musicians and heads of state gathered in Vienna in 1927 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the composer\u2019s death and next year, the 250th anniversary of the composer\u2019s birth will be celebrated not only in Europe but around the world, so universal is Beethoven\u2019s appeal. The image of the Ninth as a powerful symbol of European unity was perhaps claimed in most iconic fashion on Christmas day in 1989 when Leonard Bernstein conducted the last movement of the Ninth to celebrate the fall of the Berlin wall with an orchestra consisting of members from East and West Germany as well as the four allied powers: France, Great Britain, the Soviet Union and the US. When, in 1972, the Council of Europe decided on its anthem, Beethoven was seen as the obvious choice. EU leaders then adopted the Ninth in 1985 as the official anthem of the European Union. Given, its meaning of unity and its long association with European history, it represented not only the EU, but also Europe in a wider sense. It is all of this (sometimes painful) shared history, as well as its joy and optimism for the future, that the Brexit Party MEPs reject when they shun the Ninth. \u2022Dr Joanne Cormac is a research fellow at the University of Nottingham.",

      "bodyText": "US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has said it will pay $100m (\u00a380m) to families and communities affected by the two crashes involving its 737 Max aircraft, in which 346 people were killed. Boeing, which is facing dozens of lawsuits over the accidents, said some of the money would go towards the living expenses of the families of those involved in the fatal crashes and to alleviate any financial hardship they were facing. The payouts, phased over several years, will be independent of any lawsuits relating to the accidents, Boeing said. Relatives of passengers on a Lion Air flight that crashed off the coast of Indonesia in October 2018 have agreed to try to settle with the company through mediation but families of passengers killed in an Ethiopian Airlines crash just over four months later are waiting until more is known about the cause of the accident. \u201cThe families and loved ones of those on board have our deepest sympathies, and we hope this initial outreach can help bring them comfort,\u201d said Boeing\u2019s chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg. The $100m fund will also be spent on education and community programmes, as well as economic development in communities that have suffered, Boeing said in a statement. The plane manufacturer promised to form partnerships with local governments and non-profit organisations \u201cto address these needs\u201d. The company said in April that it expects the crashes to cost it more than $1bn, as the firm cancelled its financial outlook for 2019 and scrapped plans to reward shareholders by offering to buy back some of their stock. Muilenburg said at the time: \u201cWe have great sorrow for the families affected. This weighs heavily on us.\u201d The 737 has been the bestselling jet series in Boeing\u2019s history, with more than 15,000 orders, about 5,000 of which were for the fourth-generation 737 Max. But the model remains grounded around the world, having been taken out of service in March after the second fatal crash in four months. Although investigations continue, MCAS, an automated anti-stall system, has been implicated in both crashes, amid concern it repeatedly pushed the nose of the aircraft down, despite the pilots\u2019 efforts. US safety regulators have since identified a further problem with the model and the generation of planes that preceded the 737 Max. The Federal Aviation Administration has told airlines to check more than 300 737 aircraft, including 179 of the Max model, for improperly manufactured parts. United Airlines, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines have all extended their bans on using the Boeing 737 Max to beyond August, after the warning from the US aviation regulator. Boeing remains under investigation by regulators around the world over the fatal incidents. But it has won support from International Airlines Group (IAG), the parent company of British Airways, which last month announced plans to buy 200 Boeing 737 Max aircraft, the first new sales deal since it was grounded. IAG and Boeing revealed a \u201cletter of intent\u201d for the huge order logged at the Paris airshow, in a significant boost to the US manufacturer after its rival Airbus appeared to be stealing a march on it with big orders and the launch of a competing model. The fleet of planes, a mixture of 737 Max 8 and Max 10 variants, would be valued at about $25bn at list prices but IAG said it had secured a substantial discount, likely to be more than usual considering Boeing\u2019s difficult circumstances.",

Beech \u2013 known by the pseudonym \u201cNick\u201d when the allegations were first reported \u2013 is accused of fabricating the claims, which led to a \u00a32m Scotland Yard inquiry that closed without a single arrest being made. He denies 12 counts of perverting the course of justice and one count of fraud over a \u00a322,000 compensation payout he received. Last month, Proctor broke down in tears as he gave evidence, describing how his life became a \u201chorrendous, irrational nightmare\u201d after Beech accused him of child murder and rape. He said the claims were the \u201cravings of a fantasist\u201d. The trial has seen a video of Bramall thumping the desk as he told Scotland Yard detectives he had no sexual interest in children and was \u201cabsolutely astonished, amazed and bemused\u201d by the claims. Giving evidence on Wednesday for the first time, Beech repeated his claims of abuse, his voice cracking with emotion at times. Beech said Savile was introduced to him as a \u201cguest\u201d of a group of military abusers in Bicester, Oxfordshire, who he had been taken to by his stepfather, Maj Raymond Beech. Asked by Collingwood Thompson QC, defending, what Savile did to him, Beech replied: \u201cHe raped me over the bath.\u201d Beech said Savile, who he said he met \u201ca few\u201d times, held his head under the water, adding: \u201cI thought I was dying.

      "body": "<p>Think of the word \u201cwoman\u201d and do you automatically think \u201cbitch\u201d? Or hussy, baggage or bit? These are, according to various traditional dictionaries, synonyms for \u201cwoman\u201d, which came as a bit of a shock to Maria Beatrice Giovanardi as she typed the word into a search engine one night in January. Giovanardi was seeking inspiration as she tried to name a new project for the women\u2019s rights group she was involved with and was looking for alternative words for \u201cwoman\u201d. What she discovered instead was a wealth of derogatory entries. \u201cThey are offensive and I don\u2019t believe they are synonyms for \u2018woman\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why they are there.\u201d</p> <p>Giovanardi started looking into it more deeply, using the default dictionaries on different search engines. And she began to explore whether men were given similar treatment. They weren\u2019t \u2013 the most derogatory synonym for \u201cman\u201d given by dictionaries she found were \u201cbozo\u201d and \u201cgeezer\u201d. She was alarmed, too, by the example sentences given below the definitions. Many, she noticed, were themselves sexist, involving stereotypes and centring men. \u201cI told you to be home when I get home, little woman,\u201d is one from Oxford Dictionaries.</p> <p>Last week, Giovanardi <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/change-oxford-dictionary-s-sexist-definition-of-woman?recruiter=234306796&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=email\" title=\"\">launched a petition</a> to get dictionary makers \u2013 particularly Oxford University Press (OUP), which publishes the Oxford English Dictionary, as well as Oxford Dictionaries, the source used by Apple and Google \u2013 to cut sexist illustrative sentences and derogatory words. \u201cNot to remove them from the dictionary, but remove them from under \u2018woman\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cHistory is important, but these are just <em>not</em> synonyms of woman. Bitch can be in the dictionary, but it shouldn\u2019t be under woman in my opinion.\u201d </p> <p>Her call was shared on Twitter by the Fawcett Society. \u201cThe language we use is fundamentally framed and determined by the patriarchal society in which we live,\u201d says Sam Smethers, the organisation\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThe fact that derogatory terms are associated with the word \u2018woman\u2019 indicates how biased our language can be.\u201d We need to change, she says, \u201cthe way we think of something as important and as fundamental as the word woman\u201d.</p> <p>On Lexico, the site run by Oxford Dictionaries and Dictionary.com, synonyms for women include bitch, baggage, piece and filly. The example sentences chosen to illustrate usage are bizarre. \u201cOne of his sophisticated London women\u201d is one, as if the woman exists solely in relation to, and as a possession of, the man.

Dictionary makers bring personal, social and professional ideologies to their projects. Historically, a great many English dictionaries had strong Christian perspectives \u2026 often with strong doses of misogyny, androcentrism, racism, Anglocentrism, homophobia and so on.\u201d</p> <p>Yet women have long been involved in creating dictionaries, she says. \u201cIn the history of English lexicography, you will find a 15th-century abbess credited with a glossary of hawking and hunting, a 17th-century teenage girl who penned a dictionary of women\u2019s fashion, an 18th-century bluestocking who published one of the first and most influential thesauruses [British Synonymy], and 20th-century feminists who reinvented lexicography not only by avoiding androcentric and sexist definitions, but by centring dictionaries as a scene of social conflict and political potential.\u201d</p> <p>In the 1970s and 80s, says Cameron, \u201cthere was this whole movement to de-authorise the dictionary\u201d \u2013 or \u201cdick-tionary\u201d, as the radical feminist Mary Daly described it (n. \u201cany patriarchal dictionary\u201d) in her dictionary, Websters\u2019 First New Intergalactic Wickedary of the English Language. \u201cNow what people do is lobby the authority,\u201d says Cameron. \u201cThey don\u2019t question the authority at all. Whereas the old feminist way was to try to deconstruct the whole authority of the dictionary.\u201d</p> <p>Cheris Kramarae was one of the creators of A Feminist Dictionary, which, although published in 1985, came out of women\u2019s group meetings she was attending in the late 60s and 70s. \u201cWomen were meeting in conscious-raising groups and working in women\u2019s studies and realising that men seemed to have the monopoly on the supposedly one true view of the world,\u201d says Kramarae, a visiting professor at the Center for the Study of Women in Society at the University of Oregon. \u201cRather than thinking there was one true view of the world, [we thought] men have no monopoly on that and neither do women. That\u2019s the reason we included a variety of definitions. These days, we\u2019d be more likely to challenge not only the so-called male \u2018truth\u2019, but also the white \u2018truth\u2019, and the roles of black studies, and LGBTQ activism [around] the binary and the critique of that.\u201d Language is not, she says, \u201ca neutral carrier of our ideas \u2013 our understanding is our language and word choices are our ideas\u201d.</p> <p>Her and her colleagues\u2019 intention was to challenge the traditional dictionaries\u2019 content and authority. \u201cWe were concerned about the very widespread, damaging belief that traditional dictionaries are the primary records of language use,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd they are inhospitable to women. We worked on A Feminist Dictionary because we knew that traditional dictionaries are far from being accurate and representational records of the language usage of most of us. Yet they are handbooks sanctioned by every level of schooling. They are, in fact, instruments of social control which disguise and depress the linguistic confidence and creativity of most speakers and writers.\u201d What was the response?

Anthony Burgess wrote a really damning review, which we were delighted with because he was one of the people we would want to engage and call attention to our work.\u201d</p> <p>What good do feminist dictionaries and campaigns do? Can society be changed by changing the language? \u201cI think they happen together,\u201d says Cameron. \u201cI don\u2019t think changing language on its own usually works, but I wouldn\u2019t say language is unimportant. Language is a way in which new meanings or objections to old meanings are transmitted, so it does matter.\u201d Russell says: \u201cI do think that using language conscientiously can be a means to improving our own thinking about the world and our interactions in it.\u201d</p> <p>Dictionaries are no longer dusty reference books \u2013 we carry them on our phones in our pockets; search engines tacitly endorse whatever definition they serve up from whatever source they have licensed (presumably the most cost-effective one).

      "bodyText": "Think of the word \u201cwoman\u201d and do you automatically think \u201cbitch\u201d? Or hussy, baggage or bit? These are, according to various traditional dictionaries, synonyms for \u201cwoman\u201d, which came as a bit of a shock to Maria Beatrice Giovanardi as she typed the word into a search engine one night in January. Giovanardi was seeking inspiration as she tried to name a new project for the women\u2019s rights group she was involved with and was looking for alternative words for \u201cwoman\u201d. What she discovered instead was a wealth of derogatory entries. \u201cThey are offensive and I don\u2019t believe they are synonyms for \u2018woman\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why they are there.\u201d Giovanardi started looking into it more deeply, using the default dictionaries on different search engines. And she began to explore whether men were given similar treatment. They weren\u2019t \u2013 the most derogatory synonym for \u201cman\u201d given by dictionaries she found were \u201cbozo\u201d and \u201cgeezer\u201d. She was alarmed, too, by the example sentences given below the definitions. Many, she noticed, were themselves sexist, involving stereotypes and centring men. \u201cI told you to be home when I get home, little woman,\u201d is one from Oxford Dictionaries. Last week, Giovanardi launched a petition to get dictionary makers \u2013 particularly Oxford University Press (OUP), which publishes the Oxford English Dictionary, as well as Oxford Dictionaries, the source used by Apple and Google \u2013 to cut sexist illustrative sentences and derogatory words. \u201cNot to remove them from the dictionary, but remove them from under \u2018woman\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cHistory is important, but these are just not synonyms of woman. Bitch can be in the dictionary, but it shouldn\u2019t be under woman in my opinion.\u201d Her call was shared on Twitter by the Fawcett Society. \u201cThe language we use is fundamentally framed and determined by the patriarchal society in which we live,\u201d says Sam Smethers, the organisation\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThe fact that derogatory terms are associated with the word \u2018woman\u2019 indicates how biased our language can be.\u201d We need to change, she says, \u201cthe way we think of something as important and as fundamental as the word woman\u201d. On Lexico, the site run by Oxford Dictionaries and Dictionary.com, synonyms for women include bitch, baggage, piece and filly. The example sentences chosen to illustrate usage are bizarre. \u201cOne of his sophisticated London women\u201d is one, as if the woman exists solely in relation to, and as a possession of, the man. Another reads: \u201cThe idea that women are real human beings with thoughts and emotions is played down.\u201d For \u201cman\u201d, the examples are far more impressive. \u201cI\u2019m as ambitious as the next man\u201d; \u201cA battle for power between a union man and an intellectual is looming\u201d. Other examples under \u201cman\u201d make unnecessarily sexist points about women. \u201cShe was more of a man than any of them,\u201d is one; \u201cIt should be the sort of manly thing I get my man to do, but he leaves computers to me\u201d is another \u2013 both implying that women are the weaker, more cowardly, more stupid gender. The examples of usage are better on the Collins dictionary site (the dictionary used by the Guardian), including \u201cshe was a senior BBC woman\u201d, but it also offers offensive slang names including \u201cho\u201d as a synonym for \u201cwoman\u201d. The worst synonym for \u201cman\u201d Collins could come up with is dude or geezer. On the Merriam-Webster dictionary site, the fourth definition of \u201cwoman\u201d is a servant and the fifth is a wife or mistress. The definitions of man include \u201can alumnus of or student at a college or university\u201d \u2013 as in a Cambridge man \u2013 though this is not a definition that is extended to women.

      "bodyText": "The investment banker who was lined up to lead Santander, before it suddenly withdrew the offer over his pay demands, is suing the Spanish lender for \u20ac100m (\u00a390m). Andrea Orcel submitted a lawsuit accusing Santander of a breach of contract, according to a report in the Spanish newspaper El Confidencial, demanding the bank either hand him the sum in damages or reinstate its offer of the chief executive\u2019s post. Santander offered Orcel the job last year but changed its mind in January, four months later, saying it could not justify paying him a \u20ac50m signing-on fee. The award was intended to compensate him for bonuses he would forfeit by leaving his job as president of the investment bank at Switzerland\u2019s UBS. At the time, the bank said it had been caught off guard by his compensation demands, which were for \u201ca sum significantly above the board\u2019s original expectations at the time of the appointment\u201d. \u201cThe board considers that for Santander to pay this amount to facilitating the hiring of one individual, even one of the calibre and background of Mr Orcel, would be unacceptable for a retail and commercial bank such as Santander,\u201d it said. As well as concerns over pay, Orcel also reportedly clashed several times with Santander\u2019s executive chair, Ana Bot\u00edn, who built the bank into the eurozone\u2019s largest by stock market value, along with her father. The bank\u2019s change of heart meant Jos\u00e9 Antonio \u00c1lvarez remained in the role of chief executive, abandoning plans to transition to the chairman of Santander Spain in March. Orcel, who built a reputation as a star investment banker at UBS, was due to receive an annual pay package in line with Alvarez, who was paid \u20ac8.9m in 2017. In an interview with the FT earlier this year, Orcel said: \u201cI\u2019m not known to be a person that lets go, especially when I think the right thing to do is to not let go.\u201d Orcel\u2019s claim is believed to be based on a calculation of his lost earnings, as well as legal fees and other costs. Santander declined to comment and Mr Orcel could not be reached for comment. The circumstances of Orcel\u2019s claim against his once prospective employer are rare, in that the dispute came about before he had even taken up the position. But multimillion-pound legal tussles between companies and the people chosen to lead them are less rare. The former AA chairman Bob Mackenzie launched a \u00a3225m claim against the roadside assistance firm after he was sacked in the wake of a \u201csustained and violent assault\u201d on a colleague at a five-star hotel. This year Michael Woodford, former boss of Japanese camera firm Olympus, won a claim brought against him by one of its subsidiaries, which sought to revoke his \u00a364m pension pot. Woodford had earlier blown the whistle on a $1.7bn accounting scandal at the company. The logistics firm Stobart and its former boss Andrew Tinkler sued one another after he left following a dispute with the board over strategy. Tinkler lost an appeal this month after claiming for alleged breach of contract. In 2017, engineering group Dyson said it planned to sue the former chief executive Max Conze, alleging that he had misused company resources and leaked secrets. Conze responded with a countersuit of his own but the two sides eventually settled their dispute.",

      "bodyText": "Last weekend, a marriage proposal took place in Russia that went viral. The video showed a woman being dragged from her car by numerous masked \u201cgunmen\u201d, slammed on the bonnet and generally terrorised, before her boyfriend, who was in the car \u2013 and also in on the act, got down on one knee and proposed. The woman said yes. She should have most definitely said no. Imagine. You are sobbing as they slam you on the car. You look up to see that they have taken something off your boyfriend and are pulling out suspect packages. You start screaming. Then, suddenly, your boyfriend is down on one knee. It is meant to be the most important question you will answer in your life, but your fight or flight response is so heightened you could punch a tiger. Of course you might say yes. If you do ever find yourself about to be kidnapped, dunked underwater or pushed from a cliff, and your boyfriend suddenly proposes marriage, you really should say no. If you\u2019re being proposed to in a way that endangers your safety or intends to make you feel vulnerable, then red flags should be waving.

The gap between what Philip Hammond is saying about a no-deal Brexit and what Boris Johnson, the most probable next PM, is claiming about it is so vast that a question on this was obvious, and May\u2019s evasive answer did not really hide the fact that she clearly disagrees quite strongly with Johnson on this point. After that Corbyn and May got stuck into a prolonged Brexit blame game, that was a bit more pointed and acrimonious than their usual exchanges. May argued that, if Labour wants to avoid no-deal, it should have voted for hers, but it is never particularly convincing to hear the government plead for support from the opposition and during the exchanges Corbyn delivered two crisp and effective retorts; telling May that she could not complain about Labour MPs not backing her when Tory MPs voted against her deal too, and saying that he could not be accused of favouring no-deal because Labour tabled a motion opposing the idea. Corbyn even ended urging May to \u201cgo back to the people\u201d - code for a referendum. In policy terms, it did not go beyond anything he has said before, but the fact that he delivered this message at PMQs will be seen as yet another incremental shift into People\u2019s Vote territory.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d1c8d468f087f38aa1f3ed1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-03T11:14:29.141Z\">12.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Corbyn says Labout put forward a motion to take no-deal off the table.

Today the <strong>Economist Intelligence Unit</strong> has published a forecast confirming that. It says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Our baseline scenario (60% probability) is that - in the face of a gridlocked parliament, and no meaningful concessions from the EU - Mr Johnson will call a snap election, arguing that a Conservative majority is needed to deliver Brexit (this requires a two-thirds parliamentary majority under the 2011 Fixed-term Parliaments Act, which we think would be forthcoming).</p> \n   <p>An alternative scenario (30% probability) is that the prime minister prevails in the struggle with parliament, which either fails to coalesce around legislation to prevent a no-deal Brexit before October 31st, or is unable to oust the prime minister though a vote of no confidence in time to prevent the UK\u2019s departure. The latter could be approved by a simple majority, but would also trigger a two-week period to seek a new prime minister before an election is called. In such a no deal scenario, the UK and the EU would revert to WTO trade rules, causing severe short-term economic disruption.</p> \n   <p>A final scenario (10% probability) is that parliamentary gridlock and the deep divisions within both the Conservatives and Labour lead the prime minister to request, and to be granted, a third extension of the article 50 period for further negotiations. Such an outcome is only likely in the context of productive talks between Mr Johnson and the EU. Strong lobbying from those countries most exposed to a disorderly Brexit (Ireland, the Netherlands and Belgium) could contribute to agreement on an extension, but this would also require a change in stance from Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, the German chancellor and French president.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>(Personally, I think the EIU are overstating the chances of an election and understating the chances of no-deal, but the key point is that no one actually knows.)</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d1c83658f087f38aa1f3e63\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-03T10:45:41.434Z\">11.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The IPPR, a leftwing thinktank, has published <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/files/2019-07/fairer-welfare-july-19.pdf\">a 40-page report today (pdf)</a> on ending austerity. It calls for a shift towards an \u201cinvestment state\u201d, with significantly higher government spending on health, education and welfare, funded by higher taxes. This would lift the UK to European standards of provision,<a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/research/publications/there-is-an-alternative-ending-austerity-in-the-uk\"> it says.</a></p> \n  <p>It says two shifts in policy are required.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><strong>People on middle incomes will have to feel that those on higher incomes are paying their fair share of taxation before they are willing to pay more themselves.</strong> We therefore call for increases in corporation, wealth and income tax on high earners \u2013 together raising as much as \u00a357 billion in revenues per year \u2013 in the short run. This is crucial because to achieve the scale of revenue increases needed in the long term, the middle classes will ultimately have to pay more tax: an \u2018investment state\u2019 cannot be funded by taxes on the wealthy alone. </p> \n   <p><strong>Everybody \u2013 including those on middle and higher incomes \u2013 will need to benefit from high quality public services in order to create a coalition in favour of the \u2018investment state\u2019.</strong> This will require a shift towards more universalist public services and welfare provision.

But, judging by what he told Sky\u2019s All Out Politics this morning, he is going off the idea.

He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>My difficulty with Boris Johnson is not liking him; my difficulty is I\u2019ve no idea where he stands on a third runway [at Heathrow], I\u2019ve no idea where he stands on HS2, I\u2019ve no ideas where he stands really on sugar taxes.

Different studies have come to different conclusions, the campaign said. Here, for reference, is what the Johnson campaign said in its briefing.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><strong>There are serious questions over whether sin taxes change behaviour</strong></p> \n   <p>In the last ten years there have been a series of academic papers that have both argued for and against the proposition that \u2018sin taxes\u2019 change people\u2019s behaviour. While there have been some studies, and overviews of academic literature, that have concluded that \u2018sin taxes\u2019 are effective (for example, Wright et al., BMC Public Health, 2017, <a href=\"https://backboris.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=1a2c6c0ed7d78b7f0ba007abd&amp;id=21cb9540f1&amp;e=ec0e775874\">link</a>), there have also been a number of studies that have raised questions over their overall effectiveness. For example, for sugar, some research has suggested that the tax could increase alcohol consumption (Quirmbach et al., Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health, <a href=\"https://backboris.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=1a2c6c0ed7d78b7f0ba007abd&amp;id=cc155e2565&amp;e=ec0e775874\">link</a>).</p> \n   <p><strong>There are serious questions over whether sin taxes hit the poorest hardest</strong></p> \n   <p>In the last ten years there have been a series of academic papers that have both argued for and against the proposition that \u2018sin taxes\u2019 are regressive and hit the poorest the most. While there have been some studies that have concluded that this is not the case (BMJ, <a href=\"https://backboris.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=1a2c6c0ed7d78b7f0ba007abd&amp;id=509cf547b3&amp;e=ec0e775874\">link</a>), other studies have concluded that these taxes are regressive. For example, some studies have claimed that a 20 percent tax on sugar-sweetened beverages would take three times as much from lower-income households than from higher income households, as a percentage of disposable income (Sharma et al., the effects of taxing sugar-sweetened beverages across different income groups, Health Economics, <a href=\"https://backboris.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=1a2c6c0ed7d78b7f0ba007abd&amp;id=04d2215895&amp;e=ec0e775874\">link</a>). In addition, recent studies have suggested that sugar taxes do not reduce socioeconomic inequalities in diet-related health (University of York, July 2018, <a href=\"https://backboris.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=1a2c6c0ed7d78b7f0ba007abd&amp;id=f290cac9c1&amp;e=ec0e775874\">link</a>).</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d1c73728f088a7392737e6d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-03T09:24:43.603Z\">10.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Boris Johnson's sugar tax policy shows he has 'no concern' for health of general public, says Labour</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Labour claims that Boris Johnson\u2019s policy on sugar taxes shows that his priority is representing wealthy supporters.

No 10 has also signalled that, after she resigns at the end of this month, May will continue to warn against the dangers of no-deal from the backbenches. (See 2.30pm.) Downing Street has mounted a staunch defence of the government\u2019s sugar levy on soft drinks, after Boris Johnson announced he would impose a moratorium on \u201csin taxes\u201d if he became prime minister. The Chinese ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming has criticised Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary and Tory leadership candidate, over his comments on the unrest in Hong Kong. Liu said: I think it is totally wrong for Jeremy Hunt to talk about the freedom - this is not a matter about the freedom, it\u2019s a matter about breaking laws in Hong Kong. It\u2019s very disappointing when the senior officials of his calibre show support of these law-breaking people. We all remember what Hong Kong was 22 years ago under British rule: there was no freedom, democracy, whatever. We all know that all governors were appointed by the British government, people had no right to elect its officials, no right to demonstrate certainly, and they did not even have a right to have an independent judicial power. Hunt responded on Twitter by saying China had to honour the commitments made in the joint declaration on Hong Kong. Peers have started debating a proposal to set up a joint committee of the Commons and Lords to produce a report on the risks of a no-deal Brexit before 30 September. The motion is expected to pass. Opening the debate, Angela Smith, Labour\u2019s leader in the Lords, said: The Bank of England has estimated an immediate hit to the economy roughly equivalent to the 2008 financial crisis and a crash in the pound, disrupting trade and closing businesses. In an unprecedented joint letter to the prime minister, the heads of the TUC and the CBI warned of the dangers to the economy stating \u201cthe shock\u2026 would be felt by generations to come\u201d. The danger is real. And yet Mr Hunt has said that in the event of a no deal, he would tell the owners of bankrupt businesses that their sacrifice had been worth it. How? Because \u201c\u2026we\u2019d be living in a country where politicians do what the people tell them to do\u201d. That\u2019s not leadership. Politicians should tell the truth. And one way of getting to the truth on this matter would be via a committee that examines, interrogates and presents the evidence. The British official who was in charge of Brexit border plans has warned that the fact the government has made contingency preparations for a no-deal departure \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean \u2026 everything will be fine\u201d. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, has blamed MPs for the apparent stalling of a post-Brexit Canadian trade deal, accusing parliament of sending \u201cmixed signals\u201d to the country. Speaking to the international trade committee this morning, Fox said: The progress was very advanced: in fact we reckoned above 99% of agreement. The difference there was, as ever, that the signals coming from our parliament were conflicting. Countries were negotiating with us on the basis that there would be potential of a no-deal exit. When Parliament then says parliament will make sure that there is no possibility of a no-deal exit, those we are negotiating with get mixed signals. If parliament continues to be inconsistent, it\u2019s very difficult for the government to maintain a consistent position in terms of negotiations. Labour has said a pregnant MP who reportedly faced a motion of no confidence in her constituency is not under threat, saying no such motion will take place. The UK will have an \u201cethical\u201d development policy that puts the climate emergency and environmental protection at the heart of overseas aid, with more than \u00a3190m to be spent directly on climate-related issues in the first initiative, the government has announced. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Jeremy Hunt has just posted this on Twitter. Hunt\u2019s team say the unsolicited Boris Johnson campaign email was sent to Hunt\u2019s private email address. They are suggesting this could be another example of the Johnson campaign misusing email mailing lists. Some complaints have already been referred to the information commissioner, although the Johnson campaign has denied breaking data privacy rules. Tory MPs who support Boris Johnson for leader have been posting for photographs with him, the Telegraph\u2019s Asa Bennett reports. Labour\u2019s Wes Streeting says the monitor in the background, and the time on the clock, show that for these MPs attending the photocall took precedence over listening to Theresa May at PMQs. Ursula von der Leyen, the German defence minister nominated as the next president of the European commission, has told MEPs that the backstop needs to stay in the Brexit withdrawal agreement, Politico Europe\u2019s Josh Posaner reports. Police investigating an allegation of the burning of ballots in the Peterborough by-election have concluded that no offences were committed, the Press Association reports. Cambridgeshire Police previously said no crimes were revealed in respect of one allegation of bribery and two relating to postal votes. The force said that it had concluded its investigation into an allegation of the burning of ballots, with no crime found to be committed. The investigation into a fifth allegation, of a breach of the privacy of the vote, is continuing. The Brexit party claimed last month that vote-rigging may have played a role in Labour\u2019s wafer-thin victory in the by-election. Labour rubbished these claims as a \u201cdesperate attempt\u201d to excuse a defeat, describing the allegations as \u201cnonsense\u201d. It\u2019s not just Nigel Farage. (See 11.04am.) Jeremy Hunt is also saying that he does not know that Boris Johnson, his rival for the Tory leadership, really thinks about the sugar tax. Hunt told journalists this afternoon: I\u2019m totally confused about what Boris\u2019s policy is on this because he\u2019s saying he doesn\u2019t want these sin taxes, but he\u2019s got Matt Hancock, the health secretary in his team who strongly supports them. So I think consistency really does matter. We have an obesity epidemic. We have the second highest number of obese young people anywhere in Europe and we do need to have a solution to this. So the people who want to scrap these taxes need to say what is their plan because it\u2019s terrible for the young people involved. In the comments various people have said that I was wrong to criticise Theresa May at PMQs for using the phrase \u201call mouth and trousers\u201d. See 12.14pm. I thought she had missed out a \u201cno\u201d, but it turns out both version of the phrase gets used. And InquisitorThrax points out that the Guardian\u2019s own style guide prefers the May version. David Marsh explained why in an article in 2010. Here\u2019s an excerpt. The most exhaustive discussion of the subject I have found, however, is in Michael Quinion\u2019s book Port Out, Starboard Home (Penguin, 2005), quoted at the excellent languagehat website: \u201call mouth and trousers: This strange expression comes from the north of England and is used, mainly by women in my experience, as a sharp-tongued and effective putdown of a certain kind of pushy, over-confident male. It\u2019s a wonderful example of metonymy (\u2018a container for the thing contained\u2019) ... What is interesting about the saying from a folk etymological point of view is that its opaqueness has led its modern users to reinterpret it as \u2018all mouth and no trousers\u2019.\u201d A commenter adds: \u201cI think the metonymy is ironic the way I always heard it \u2013 all mouth and trousers implying the \u2018empty\u2019 container \u2013 all front and bravado, but no brains or balls (or penis if you prefer).\u201d Which may be a good place to leave it. My conclusion? \u201cAll mouth and trousers\u201d probably came first, and in the interests of consistency, we shall keep it in the style guide. But let\u2019s not get too prescriptive about it: both phrases will have their adherents, and you should use whichever pleases you more. The head of the civil service will face demands for an independent investigation into reports a senior officials believe Jeremy Corbyn would not be \u201cphysically or mentally\u201d up to the job of prime minister, the Press Association reports. The Labour leader will meet Sir Mark Sedwill face-to-face in parliament this afternoon to set out his concerns that an investigation by the civil service alone will not be sufficient. Corbyn\u2019s spokesman said the actions by the unnamed officials at the \u201capex of the civil service\u201d were \u201cout of order\u201d. In his meeting with Sedwill, Corbyn \u201cwill be pressing the case for a genuinely independent investigation into what took place\u201d. The row was triggered by a report in the Times, which said the future of Corbyn, 70, was openly discussed at an event attended by mandarins amid suggestions he has become \u201ctoo frail and is losing his memory\u201d. Corbyn\u2019s spokesman told journalists: You have clear evidence in reports of senior civil servants briefing against the elected leader of the opposition and not only briefing against him and claiming he is not up to the job but also briefing on the basis of false information - namely that he is ill or his health is impaired. That is entirely untrue so on both counts you are talking about a very serious breach of civil service neutrality, a principle that absolutely underlines our democratic constitution. It was not appropriate for the civil service \u201cto be marking their own homework\u201d and there should be an \u201cindependent element in the investigation to restore confidence in those people at the apex of the civil service\u201d, he said. Speaking to journalists after PMQs, a Downing Street spokesman was asked about the prime minister\u2019s future role, once she steps aside. He said: She will certainly play her full part in serving her constituents of Maidenhead. She very quickly when she announced her intention to step down as prime minister made very clear that she wanted to serve for at least the remainder of the parliament. I think she\u2019s totally focused on that. I think that\u2019s what you would expect from her. As for her stance in relation to a no-deal Brexit, he said: You can expect her to examine any future proposals on their merits. And asked whether the PM could vote against a no-deal plan, he said: It\u2019s not something I have discussed with her; but she has always been very clear about what she sees as the virtues of leaving in an orderly way, with a deal. One of the most interesting exchanges in the statement came when Chris Leslie, the Change UK MP, asked Theresa May if she thought Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt were being realistic in claiming to be able to renegotiate Brexit in a few weeks. He asked: [Johnson and Hunt] are absolutely adamant that during August and September they can negotiate a superior withdrawal agreement, perhaps with extra positive energy says the former foreign secretary. Does [May] think that it will be that simple? May did not criticise her two potential successors directly, but she would not say that she thought they were being realistic, and her answer implied that in private she might be almost as sceptical as Leslie. She told him: Obviously it is up to whoever succeeds me to take forward negotiations and to look at the relationship for withdrawing from the European Union and our future relationship with the European Union in the way that they best think fit. The EU council has made statements about the negotiations so far and about their position on those negotiations, but obviously it will be up to my successor to take this forward. The reference to EU council statements was a reference to comments like this one, from Donald Tusk, president of the European council, after the EU summit in June. On 21 June Tusk said this (I\u2019ve added the bold type): At the end of our meeting, the EU27 briefly came back to the issue of Brexit. We have agreed on the following, united approach of the EU27: we look forward to working together with the next UK prime minister; we want to avoid a disorderly Brexit and establish a future relationship that is as close as possible with the UK; we are open for talks when it comes to the declaration on the future UK-EU relations if the position of the United Kingdom were to evolve, but the withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation; and we have been informed on the state of play of planning for a no-deal scenario. The May statement is now over. She was at the despatch box for two hours. Labour\u2019s Chris Bryant congratulated Theresa May on the expression she managed when she met President Putin at the G20. He said it has \u201cmore ice in it than a polar ice cap\u201d. May told him that, referring to Putin\u2019s comments about liberalism being obsolete, she told him liberalism had done more than any other system to spread prosperity. And, on the subject of her expression, she said, unlike the polar ice cap, \u201cI\u2019m not melting\u201d. HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh has another line from the No 10 briefing. Craig Mackinlay, a Conservative, asks May if she agrees that the behind-closed-doors selection process for the new EU leaders shows disrespect for the views of EU voters. May says it will be up to the EU to decide how it changes its procedures going forward. This is from my colleague Heather Stewart, who has been at the post-PMQs/statement briefing by Number 10. Chris Leslie, the Change UK MP, asks May if she thinks it is credible for Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt to claim they can renegotiate a new Brexit deal with the EU within weeks. May notes what the EU has said, but says it will be for her successor to decide his approach. May refuses to say whether she thinks that it will be possible for Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt to renegotiate Brexit within weeks. Alistair Burt, the Tory former Foreign Office minister, asks May to condemn the \u201cchildish\u201d and \u201cunfortunate\u201d anti-German rhetoric sometimes coming from Tory MPs. He is referring to Bill Cash. (See 1.17pm.) May does not refer to Cash\u2019s comment directly, but she says she wants to maintain good relations with the EU. Labour\u2019s Pat McFadden asks May about the Brexit party protest in the European parliament yesterday. Does she agree the UK is not a colony of Europe? May says the UK has played a constructive role in Europe. She wants to see it respected. May refuses to condemn Brexit party\u2019s protest against European anthem in the European parliament yesterday. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit committee, asks May if she has had a discussion with her Canadian opposite number about the roll-over of the Canadian free trade deal with the EU, Ceta. There are reports Canada will not roll it over. And he praises Philip Hammond, the chancellor, who is on the front bench alongside May, for his warnings about a no-deal Brexit. May says the government is continuing to talk to Canada about rolling over Ceta. Sir Edward Leigh, a Conservative, asks May if she would advise her successor that no deal is better than a bad deal. May says she has always thought that. But she would encourage her successor to get a good deal. Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, says if the UK was dependent on WTO rules, it would be dependent on a very weak organisation. May says the UK is pushing for a resolution to the dispute that is delaying appointments to the WTO\u2019s appellate body, which is impairing its work. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Wesminster, asks why at PMQs May did not seem to know about a speech she is due to give in Scotland on devolution. He says it has been widely briefed by Downing Street. He says President Trump is \u201cirresponsible and delusional\u201d on climate change. He says May in her statement did not say anything about the Japanese foreign minister\u2019s warnings about a no-deal Brexit. Will May vote against a no-deal Brexit? And will she admit she has made a multitude of mistakes? May says she will be going to Scotland tomorrow to make a speech about the benefits of the union. But she urges Blackford to listen to what she has to say. She criticises the SNP for not using devolved powers it has been given. Sir Bill Cash, the Tory Brexiter, says since the 1980s he has been warning about Germany\u2019s influence over the EU. He says his is worried that these appointments give Germany too much influence. May says she is disappointed by Cash\u2019s comment. She says Germany has not had a president of the commission since the 1960s. (Actually, it has never had one.) And May says Ursula von der Leyen was actually born in Brussels - although she admits that this may not make it any better in the eyes of Cash. May is responding to Corbyn. She says she hopes the US does opt back into the Paris climate change agreement. She says she told the crown prince she expected a transparent investigation into the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. And she says she raised Yemen too, and stressed her desire for a political solution. On Russia, she says will take no lessons from Corbyn on Russia because he initialled sided with Russia\u2019s account after the attack. On Brexit, she says people have been waiting for weeks for Labour\u2019s policy on Brexit. The shadow cabinet is meant to be taking a decision. But week after week nothing happens. She says it is no wonder Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, says she is beginning to worry about it. Jeremy Corbyn starts by paying tribute to Carolyn Harris. (See 12.53am.) He says, where world leaders have failed, civil society and the young have taken the lead. He says the G20 summit did not go far enough on climate change. Will Theresa May condemn President Trump\u2019s stance. He asks why UK aid gets spent on carbon energy. He asks May if she asked crown prince Mohammed bin Salman about the murder of Jamal Khashoggi when she met him? And did she ask about Yemen. He urges May to publish the full report commissioned into Saudi funding of extremism in the UK. He asks why the Conservatives have joined a group in the European parliament including the Spanish far-right party, Vox. Vox are a party campaigning to repeal gender-rights laws, he says. And does May agree her successor should go back to the people on Brexit, under the uncertainty, and get Brexit resolved? Turning to the EU summit, May says the UK said it would engage constructively with EU affairs while it remained a member. She summarises the proposed EU appointments. The UK supported this package, she says. She says it is in the UK\u2019s national interest to have a constructive relationship with those appointed. Theresa May is now making a Commons statement on the G20 summit and the EU summit. She says 19 countries at the G20 agreed a statement on climate change. It is disappointing that the US did not agree. She says the Iran nuclear deal makes the world safer. She wants to see it continue. She says she told Vladimir Putin at their meeting that the UK has irrefutable evidence that two Russians were responsible for the Salisbury novichok attack. She says the UK wants to see them brought to justice. She says she told Putin that she was open to having a different relationship with with Russia, but Russia needed to adopt a different path. The Labour MP Carolyn Harris rises to make a point of order. She uses it to thank Theresa May for agreeing to set up the children\u2019s funeral fund. Harris campaigned for this having had to borrow money to pay for her own son\u2019s funeral. She thanks everyone who has made this happen from the bottom of her heart. MPs give her a round of applause, which is very unusual. MPs aren\u2019t meant to applaud in the chamber. May responds. She says she is pleased to have been able to introduce this fund, and she pays tribute to Harris for her campaigning on this. Labour\u2019s Marie Rimmer asks about a constituent with a Down\u2019s Syndrome child. She says the tax rules for carers like her constituent are confusing. May says the government wants to provide more empowerment for women. Labour\u2019s David Lammy asks about the Windrush review. It was due out in March. Will it be published before May leaves office. May says it is up to Wendy Williams when she finishes the review. She says she thinks it has not yet been completed. Nigel Huddleston, a Conservative, asks May about tourism. May says the government is working with the tourist industry to encourage people to come to the UK. Labour\u2019s Steve Reed asks about a murder in his Croydon constituency. He says the government is not doing enough on knife crime. May says this case was shocking. But the government is taking action, and this requires a multi-faceted approach, she says. Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, says May\u2019s former school is planning to move to part-time education because of financial pressure. Does she agree schools need more? May says the government is already putting more money into schools. She says she has read in the Maidenhead Advertiser that he thinks she will stand down as an MP. She won\u2019t. And the story even quoted Cable getting the name of her seat wrong. The Lib Dems are wrong on facts, wrong on everything, he says. Labour\u2019s Grahame Morris says the Treasury has taken funds from the surpluses in miners\u2019 pension funds. Can the government review this so miners get their fair share? May says one of the biggest hits on pension funds came from the last Labour government, when it took \u00a3100bn out of pension funds. Jonathan Reynolds, the Labour MP, asks May if she agrees that bus subsidies should increase so people outside London can have as good a bus service as in the capital. May says the government spends \u00a3250m a year on bus subsidies. She says the number of services on offer has gone up. Anne-Marie Trevelyan, a Conservative, asks if May agrees that the Russian submarine accident shows the need for investment in submarines. May expresses condolences to the family and friends of those who died. She says the government is committed to its submarine programme. Jack Brereton, a Conservative, asks about investment in Stoke. May says the government has put money into the high street fund, and bids are being considered. Labour\u2019s Hugh Gaffney asks if May agrees that all pensioners should continue to get free TV licences. May says people will wonder why the BBC is raising salaries while cutting free TV licences. It should think again. As for May\u2019s question, the FT\u2019s Henry Mance had an answer on Twitter last night. Nicky Morgan, a Conservative, asks about a constituent whose daughter killed herself after reading a book about taking pills from Amazon. Does May agree that Amazon has a duty not to sell books like this? May says the government is working with tech companies to get them to take more responsibility for looking after their uses. Jackie Doyle-Price, the minister for suicide prevention, is aware of this issue, and will be writing to Amazon about it, she says. PMQs - Snap verdict: Jeremy Corbyn often seems wary of raising Brexit at PMQs, but when he does it is normally a success, as it was today. The gap between what Philip Hammond is saying about a no-deal Brexit and what Boris Johnson, the most probable next PM, is claiming about it is so vast that a question on this was obvious, and May\u2019s evasive answer did not really hide the fact that she clearly disagrees quite strongly with Johnson on this point. After that Corbyn and May got stuck into a prolonged Brexit blame game, that was a bit more pointed and acrimonious than their usual exchanges. May argued that, if Labour wants to avoid no-deal, it should have voted for hers, but it is never particularly convincing to hear the government plead for support from the opposition and during the exchanges Corbyn delivered two crisp and effective retorts; telling May that she could not complain about Labour MPs not backing her when Tory MPs voted against her deal too, and saying that he could not be accused of favouring no-deal because Labour tabled a motion opposing the idea. Corbyn even ended urging May to \u201cgo back to the people\u201d - code for a referendum. In policy terms, it did not go beyond anything he has said before, but the fact that he delivered this message at PMQs will be seen as yet another incremental shift into People\u2019s Vote territory. Corbyn says Labout put forward a motion to take no-deal off the table. The MD of Iceland says some food prices could go up by 20% under no-deal. Can May confirm the EU ruled out renegotiating the backstop. May says everyone knows what the EU agreed. She says, on the key votes, Labour voted for a no-deal. Typical of Corbyn, she says - \u201call mouth and trousers\u201d. (She means no trousers). Corbyn says no-deal would disastrous. This government is an irrelevance, he says. He says the two Tory leadership candidates both have fantasy plans. He says the best option would be to \u201cgo back to the people\u201d and let them decide what to do next. May says, if you want to avoid no-deal, you must vote for a deal. She says many in the shadow cabinet do not support Brexit. Labour want to block Brexit. \u201cAnd that would be a betrayal of the many by the few.\u201d UPDATE: I\u2019ve been unfair to May. In the comments cipher1978 says he thinks \u201call mouth and trousers\u201d is correct. A quick internet search shows both phrases get used. Corbyn says May could not even get her party to vote for her deal. He quotes other business concerns about a no-deal Brexit. So what can May say to workers at Ellesmere Port and elsewhere? He says May should speak to both of the candidates to succeed her and say that, as they trade insults, thousands of jobs are at risk. May says she would tell the Ellesmere Port workforce Tory MPs voted to protect their jobs. Labour voted against. The threat to them comes from Labour, she says. Corbyn says Labour exists to protect jobs. What impact would no-deal have on food prices and farming? May says Labour has voted three times for no-deal, putting jobs at risk. And it has voted against tax cuts. She says she will take no lectures from Labour on protecting jobs. Jeremy Corbyn offers his condolences to the families of the rail workers killed in the accident in Port Talbot. He also congratulates Rose Hudson-Wilkin, who was a brilliant priest in Hackney before coming to the Commons, she says. He also congratulates the England women\u2019s team, and pays tribute to Pride. Corbyn asks if he agrees with Philip Hammond, who says a no-deal Brexit would cost \u00a390b, or Boris Johnson, who says fears about no-deal are confected nonsense. The chancellor says that a no-deal Brexit would cause a \u00a390bn hit to the public finances. The former foreign secretary says concerns about no-deal are confected hysteria. Who does the prime minister think is right? May says the figure quoted by Hammond was in the public domain. She voted for a deal, she says. The figure that was quoted was publicly available at the time, it was a figure that was quoted in the government\u2019s economic analysis in relation to these matters. But can I also say to you that if you are worried about no-deal, I have done everything I can to ensure we leave the EU with a deal. I can look workers in the eye and tell them I voted to leave with a deal that protects jobs. You can\u2019t do that because you voted three times for no-deal. May refuses to back Boris Johnson\u2019s claims about no-deal fears being exaggerated. Corbyn says a cabinet note says no-deal would be very serious. He says Make UK has said politicians have made businesses complacent about no-deal. Are they right? May says the opposition should have voted for a deal. Hugo Swire, a Conservative, asks if May has a message for the people of Hong Kong. May says people were marching peacefully in Hong Kong. It is vital that Hong Kong\u2019s high degree of autonomy is respected. She has raised this with Chinese leaders, she says. Labour\u2019s Neil Coyle asks about knife crime, and says government paralysis means this problem has not been tackled. May says the government has been acting on this. She says this is not just a policing issue. More powers have been given to police. But it is not just a matter of policing; it is about ensuring young people don\u2019t carry knives. Theresa May starts by saying England\u2019s Lionesses have inspired millions and made the nation proud. She congratulated the Speaker\u2019s chaplain, Rose Hudson-Wilkin, on becoming bishop of Dover. And she pays tribute to Pride. PMQs is due to start soon. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. There is increasing interest in the question of whether or not the Brexit party would cooperate with a Boris Johnson-led Conservative party in a general election (see 11.04am) because at Westminster the odds on an early election are getting shorter and shorter. Today the Economist Intelligence Unit has published a forecast confirming that. It says: Our baseline scenario (60% probability) is that - in the face of a gridlocked parliament, and no meaningful concessions from the EU - Mr Johnson will call a snap election, arguing that a Conservative majority is needed to deliver Brexit (this requires a two-thirds parliamentary majority under the 2011 Fixed-term Parliaments Act, which we think would be forthcoming). An alternative scenario (30% probability) is that the prime minister prevails in the struggle with parliament, which either fails to coalesce around legislation to prevent a no-deal Brexit before October 31st, or is unable to oust the prime minister though a vote of no confidence in time to prevent the UK\u2019s departure. The latter could be approved by a simple majority, but would also trigger a two-week period to seek a new prime minister before an election is called. In such a no deal scenario, the UK and the EU would revert to WTO trade rules, causing severe short-term economic disruption. A final scenario (10% probability) is that parliamentary gridlock and the deep divisions within both the Conservatives and Labour lead the prime minister to request, and to be granted, a third extension of the article 50 period for further negotiations. Such an outcome is only likely in the context of productive talks between Mr Johnson and the EU. Strong lobbying from those countries most exposed to a disorderly Brexit (Ireland, the Netherlands and Belgium) could contribute to agreement on an extension, but this would also require a change in stance from Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, the German chancellor and French president. (Personally, I think the EIU are overstating the chances of an election and understating the chances of no-deal, but the key point is that no one actually knows.) The IPPR, a leftwing thinktank, has published a 40-page report today (pdf) on ending austerity. It calls for a shift towards an \u201cinvestment state\u201d, with significantly higher government spending on health, education and welfare, funded by higher taxes. This would lift the UK to European standards of provision, it says. It says two shifts in policy are required. People on middle incomes will have to feel that those on higher incomes are paying their fair share of taxation before they are willing to pay more themselves. We therefore call for increases in corporation, wealth and income tax on high earners \u2013 together raising as much as \u00a357 billion in revenues per year \u2013 in the short run. This is crucial because to achieve the scale of revenue increases needed in the long term, the middle classes will ultimately have to pay more tax: an \u2018investment state\u2019 cannot be funded by taxes on the wealthy alone. Everybody \u2013 including those on middle and higher incomes \u2013 will need to benefit from high quality public services in order to create a coalition in favour of the \u2018investment state\u2019. This will require a shift towards more universalist public services and welfare provision. We therefore call for the additional funding raised in the short term to be invested in universal childcare, social care and mental health provision \u2013 as well as reversing cuts to universal credit, adult education and public health. These priorities should be funded before more regressive universalist policies such as free tuition fees are considered. This is very much in line with Labour party thinking and John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has welcomed the report. He said: The failure of austerity on all counts is now widely accepted and it\u2019s important that the IPPR is highlighting the deficits in health, care, skills and income security. We need bold thinking about how to fund the things we all need. It\u2019s a depressing comment on the state of the Conservative party that instead of rebuilding our scarred public services and social security system they are fixated on 1980s-style swingeing tax cuts. After PMQs we\u2019ve got a statement today on the EU summit, the one where Theresa May played a backseat role as the EU selected candidates for its top jobs. Nick Boles, who was a Conservative MP until he left to sit as an independent in protest at the party\u2019s refusal to compromise over Brexit, says that Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt are announcing policies, like the possible repeal of the sugar tax, that have no chance of getting through parliament. On the subject of how the Brexit party is evolving into something much more than a single-issue protest party (see 11.04am), this UnHerd article by Freddie Sayers about the Brexit party rally at the weekend is worth reading. Here\u2019s an extract. Farage\u2019s offer is a hybrid of anti-corporate populism and Thatcherite appeal to small business owners. He is responding to a deeply held feeling across the country that London has benefited over recent decades as the regions have declined. And crucially it makes Boris Johnson, inextricably associated with London as its twice-elected Mayor, a highly vulnerable adversary. Last month Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, suggested that he would be willing to form some sort of pact with a Conservative party led by Boris Johnson to deliver a hard Brexit, if parliament blocked no-deal. But, judging by what he told Sky\u2019s All Out Politics this morning, he is going off the idea. Asked about his relations with Johnson, Farage said he did not trust the favourite in the Tory leadership contest because he did not know what Johnson really thought. He explained: My difficulty with Boris Johnson is not liking him; my difficulty is I\u2019ve no idea where he stands on a third runway [at Heathrow], I\u2019ve no idea where he stands on HS2, I\u2019ve no ideas where he stands really on sugar taxes. Immigration? This is a guy who just flips and flops, says what he thinks the audience wants to hear. When it comes to Brexit, I heard him yesterday talking in Belfast saying that the Irish backstop was unacceptable. And yet he voted for it at the third time of asking. So it\u2019s very difficult to know just how sincere Boris is when he says he will take us out on 31 October. My feeling is they\u2019re words to get elected and I\u2019ll be very surprised if he delivers. Farage said that Theresa May declared on more than 100 occasions that the UK would be leaving the EU on 31 March, and yet that did not happen. \u201cI just don\u2019t feel I can trust anything the Conservatives say at this moment in time,\u201d he said. Farage also said the Brexit party was not just interested in Brexit anyway. He said that the party was now about the \u201ccomplete breakdown of trust that has occurred between the Westminster parties and Middle England\u201d and that this would be a \u201creal problem\u201d for Johnson. In its news release about the sin tax announcement (see 9.11am), the Boris Johnson campaign said that there was no academic consensus over whether \u201csin taxes\u201d worked, and whether they were regressive (the two issues his review will consider). Different studies have come to different conclusions, the campaign said. Here, for reference, is what the Johnson campaign said in its briefing. There are serious questions over whether sin taxes change behaviour In the last ten years there have been a series of academic papers that have both argued for and against the proposition that \u2018sin taxes\u2019 change people\u2019s behaviour. While there have been some studies, and overviews of academic literature, that have concluded that \u2018sin taxes\u2019 are effective (for example, Wright et al., BMC Public Health, 2017, link), there have also been a number of studies that have raised questions over their overall effectiveness. For example, for sugar, some research has suggested that the tax could increase alcohol consumption (Quirmbach et al., Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health, link). There are serious questions over whether sin taxes hit the poorest hardest In the last ten years there have been a series of academic papers that have both argued for and against the proposition that \u2018sin taxes\u2019 are regressive and hit the poorest the most. While there have been some studies that have concluded that this is not the case (BMJ, link), other studies have concluded that these taxes are regressive. For example, some studies have claimed that a 20 percent tax on sugar-sweetened beverages would take three times as much from lower-income households than from higher income households, as a percentage of disposable income (Sharma et al., the effects of taxing sugar-sweetened beverages across different income groups, Health Economics, link). In addition, recent studies have suggested that sugar taxes do not reduce socioeconomic inequalities in diet-related health (University of York, July 2018, link). Labour claims that Boris Johnson\u2019s policy on sugar taxes shows that his priority is representing wealthy supporters. This is from Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary. This is extraordinary even by Boris Johnson\u2019s standards. On the same day that Cancer Research UK is warning of the rising cancer threat of obesity, and with his own cheerleader Matt Hancock supporting a plan to strengthen the obesity strategy, Johnson wants to water down the plan to tackle it. He has serious questions to answer about the role of corporate lobbyists for the soft drinks and tobacco industries in his campaign. Boris Johnson has shown that his priority is representing the interests of his wealthy supporters, with no concern for the health and wellbeing of the general public. On the Today programme this morning Penny Mordaunt, the defence secretary and women and equalities minister, said that the UK parliament would liberalise Northern Ireland\u2019s strict abortion law if, as expected, a court rules it is incompatible with the Human Rights Act. She explained: The reason why this hasn\u2019t been dealt with to date is because it is a devolved matter and we take devolution seriously. We are expecting a ruling shortly that what is going on in Northern Ireland is incompatible with an individual\u2019s human rights. In every single case where there has been a declaration of incompatibility with human rights the government has acted. This government has acted, previous governments have acted. Parliament has been very vocal on this issue and if a government didn\u2019t act parliament would and there would be clearly a free vote on that issue. Mordaunt also indicated her strong personal preference for changing the law in Northern Ireland. I think this needs to be resolved. I think the paucity of care that women have endured in Northern Ireland is the most appalling thing. It must change, that is my view. At a Tory leadership election hustings in Belfast yesterday Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt both said it was primarily for Northern Ireland to decide if it wanted to liberalise its laws to allow abortion and same-sex marriage, in line with the rest of the UK, and that this was one reason they wanted the power-sharing executive restored. The Times\u2019 Matt Chorley says Boris Johnson used to favour sugar taxes. Chorley also says that one of his Johnson\u2019s advisers has been involved in lobbying against the sugar tax. Sky\u2019s Sam Coates identifies another figure linked to the Johnson campaign who has a record of opposing sugar taxes. Here is a better link to the article Coates is referring to. In relation to these last two tweets, it is worth pointing out that establishing that \u2018X favours policy Z, X advises/gets a job with/donates to politician Y, then Y implements policy Z\u2019 may look unsavoury but normally isn\u2019t. It is more often just a case of people in politics choosing to work for, or take advice from, people who share their views. On the Today programme Camilla Cavendish, who used to be director at policy at Downing Street for David Cameron, said that she used to share Boris Johnson\u2019s scepticism about \u201csin taxes\u201d like the sugar levy but that she had changed her mind. She told the programme: I think [Johnson] is wrong. I used to think we shouldn\u2019t use government to influence people\u2019s choices. But I changed my mind, really for three reasons. First of all I became a parent and I saw how much junk manufacturers are pushing down our children\u2019s throats. But I also became concerned about obesity and type two diabetes, which is costing the NHS a lot of money and is really a miserable, miserable condition. And it\u2019s the children who [on] the poorest incomes who are most affected by obesity, which is one of the main reasons we did introduce the sugar tax because we felt it was an issue of social justice in some ways. Boris is talking about not clobbering people on lower incomes. But that tax is one way to help people just drink better. And the third reason I became convinced about all this is I read the research which shows that sugar is as addictive as nicotine. And that\u2019s partly why so many of our public health programmes haven\u2019t worked because we all find it really hard to give up. Say what you like about Boris Johnson - and we will, at length - but the favourite in the Tory leadership contest clearly has some exceptional skills not shared by less mortals. For example, who else could make the Westminster commentariat feel sorry for Matt Hancock? Hancock, the health secretary, did not get very far in the Tory leadership contest, but he campaigned with some energy and imagination and emerged with his reputation enhanced. Then he decided to endorse Johnson and, in an excruciating Today programme on Monday, devoted to explaining why he was going back on everything he said about Johnson earlier, any credit he had gained himself evaporated. And now it has got worse. As my colleague Heather Stewart explains, Johnson is trampling all over one of Hancock\u2019s key policy initiatives. Here is Heather\u2019s story. And this is how it starts. Boris Johnson has announced a wide-ranging review of \u201csin stealth taxes\u201d just days before his high-profile supporter Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is due to publish a green paper advocating extending the sugar tax to milkshakes. The policy green paper called Advancing our Health \u2013 Prevention in the 2020s, has been circulating among cabinet ministers this week and is due to be published in the next few days. A draft seen by the Guardian includes widely trailed plans to extend the sugar tax to \u201csugary milk drinks \u2026 if the evidence shows that industry has not made enough progress on reducing sugar\u201d. It also announces a ban on the sale of energy drinks to under-16s, alongside a slew of other policies aimed at improving public health. The government has been consulting on the proposals for months and Hancock\u2019s junior minister, Seema Kennedy, had been expected to launch the green paper within days. However, in his latest headline-grabbing campaign pledge, Johnson said he would carry out a review of whether \u201cstealth sin taxes\u201d were successful in changing behaviour and whether they disproportionately affected poorer consumers. Johnson is not yet committing to reverse the sugar tax introduced in 2016. The press release issued by his team last night says he is just committing to \u201ca comprehensive review into the effectiveness of the \u2018sin taxes\u2019 - including products high in salt, fat or sugar - and to assess whether or not these taxes unfairly hit those on lower incomes\u201d, and to promising not to extend these taxes until the review has been completed. But the press notice also says Johnson has already promised not to extend the sugar tax to sugary milk drinks (aka, the milkshake tax), and the Sun newspaper has this morning welcomed Johnson\u2019s announcement as a victory for its Hands Off Our Grub anti sugar tax campaign, and so it is not hard to guess where this is all heading. Overnight Steve Brine, who was public health minister until he resigned over Brexit earlier this year, has accused Johnson of \u2018transparent dog whistle politics\u201d. I will post more reaction shortly. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, gives evidence to the international trade committee. 10.30am: High court judges give their reasons for the decision not to allow Boris Johnson to be prosecuted for misconduct in public office over false claims in the EU referendum campaign. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. 3.30pm: Peers debate a motion to create a joint committee of MPs and peers to consider the impact of a no-deal Brexit. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing mostly on the Tory leadership contest. I plan to publish a summary at lunchtime and then another when I finish. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

One wealthy Chinese couple had an alternative idea. In 2015, <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/travelling-couple-bring-their-unique-world-view-to-china-in-online-show/article30117464/\">tofu mogul turned world explorer</a> Zhang Xinyu and his wife, Liang Hong, projected a holographic image of a buddha into one of the empty niches, and donated the $120,000 projector used to do so to the Afghan Ministry of Culture afterwards. It was a generous act, but it hasn\u2019t proved particularly useful: Bamiyan has no mains electricity system, so the power-hungry contraption needs a diesel generator. It is rarely operated as a result. Local heritage officials, meanwhile, bemoan that the European archaeologists who had been working on the site <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/world/asia/afghanistan-bamiyan-buddhas.html\">took the keys with them when they left</a>.</p> <p>The Taliban\u2019s attempt to obliterate anything that indicated civilisation pre-Islam is just one of the many chapters in this illuminating if depressing exhibition, which charts the extreme lengths we have gone to as a species to obliterate the physical traces of rival powers and competing ideologies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c6c8e4adbf461416154d47d54ea76885b600796\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c6c8e4adbf461416154d47d54ea76885b600796/0_100_4588_3332/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The view looking east from the tower of St Mary Arches in Exeter.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"726\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The view looking east from the tower of St Mary Arches in Exeter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Historic England Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cA nation stays alive when its culture stays alive,\u201d proclaims a slogan on the wall, taken from a stone plaque outside the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2010/nov/29/art-afghanistan\">Afghan National Museum</a> in Kabul (where the Taliban <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jun/19/highereducation.arts\">wrought further vandalism</a>), the corollary being that a nation can just as easily be expunged by the deletion of its heritage. From the bombing of cathedrals in Coventry and Dresden, to the burning of books in Sarajevo, to the levelling of Homs, the exhibition shows how the strategic destruction and appropriation of cultural artefacts has always been at the heart of modern warfare.

Above it hangs the puffed-up uniform of Hermann Goering, Hitler\u2019s deputy, a white jacket with gold brocading he designed himself. It is an appropriately bloated outfit for a man whose appetite for plundered art saw him acquire three new paintings a week at the height of the Nazi looting, to decorate his own sprawling home.</p> <p>Almost 75 years later, the struggle to find and return the pillaged booty is still ongoing. The exhibition shows an image that Florence\u2019s Uffizi Gallery displayed earlier this year, depicting a painting seized by Nazi troops in 1943 surrounded by banners saying \u201cStolen!\u201d The campaign has paid off: just last week, the descendants of the German soldier who stole the work <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-48812123\">finally reached an agreement to return it</a>.</p> <p>From the Nazis and the Taliban to Isis\u2019s more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/apr/01/the-recapture-of-palmyra-in-pictures-syrian-government-army-isis\">recent destruction of Palmyra</a>, there is plenty on the bad guys, but not much space devoted to the more nuanced topic of the damage wrought by the supposed good guys, like the trail of vandalism left by coalition forces in Iraq. It would have been an interesting counterpoint to highlight the fact that, in 2003, US-led troops chose the site of Babylon as the location for their military base, building a depot and helipads on the ruins of the ancient city, renowned for its beauty and splendour a thousand years before Europe built anything comparable. Decorated bricks that formed the famous dragons of the Ishtar Gate were gouged out of the walls, while 2,600-year-old pavements were crushed by military vehicles and vast amounts of earth, mixed with archaeological fragments, were dug up to fill thousands of sandbags.

But, after days of assaults, the majestic statues still wouldn\u2019t budge. \u201cThis work of destruction is not as simple as people might think,\u201d lamented the Taliban\u2019s information minister, Qudratullah Jamal in March 2001, midway through their frenzied campaign to erase the figures, which they had decreed to be blasphemous idols. \u201cYou can\u2019t knock down the statues by shelling as both are carved into a cliff; they are firmly attached to the mountain.\u201d After two weeks of botched bombardment, the Taliban leaders ordered anti-tank mines to be placed at the foot of the cliffs, to be detonated by falling debris from artillery fire, followed by having abseilers place explosives into holes drilled into the statues, which finally reduced the precious monuments to rubble. An imposing image of one of the empty niches greets visitors to the Imperial War Museum in London, at the entrance to What Remains, a new exhibition that explores a hundred years of cultural heritage in the firing sights \u2013 and the highly charged debates around repair, reconstruction and restitution that always follow the devastation. Almost two decades after the Taliban\u2019s destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas, there is still no consensus about whether they should be rebuilt, or their ghostly shells left as a reminder of this dark chapter in the country\u2019s history. One wealthy Chinese couple had an alternative idea. In 2015, tofu mogul turned world explorer Zhang Xinyu and his wife, Liang Hong, projected a holographic image of a buddha into one of the empty niches, and donated the $120,000 projector used to do so to the Afghan Ministry of Culture afterwards. It was a generous act, but it hasn\u2019t proved particularly useful: Bamiyan has no mains electricity system, so the power-hungry contraption needs a diesel generator. It is rarely operated as a result. Local heritage officials, meanwhile, bemoan that the European archaeologists who had been working on the site took the keys with them when they left. The Taliban\u2019s attempt to obliterate anything that indicated civilisation pre-Islam is just one of the many chapters in this illuminating if depressing exhibition, which charts the extreme lengths we have gone to as a species to obliterate the physical traces of rival powers and competing ideologies. \u201cA nation stays alive when its culture stays alive,\u201d proclaims a slogan on the wall, taken from a stone plaque outside the Afghan National Museum in Kabul (where the Taliban wrought further vandalism), the corollary being that a nation can just as easily be expunged by the deletion of its heritage. From the bombing of cathedrals in Coventry and Dresden, to the burning of books in Sarajevo, to the levelling of Homs, the exhibition shows how the strategic destruction and appropriation of cultural artefacts has always been at the heart of modern warfare. A second section looks at the responses, explaining how the process of documenting the destruction of the second world war laid the foundations for the work of Historic England (which co-curated the show), to more recent efforts by the likes of Google to digitise lost artefacts from crowdsourced images, including the Lion of Mosul, destroyed by Islamic State in 2015, and now 3D-printed in miniature in the exhibition. One of the most haunting vitrines displays a photo album from the Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg, a Nazi task force dedicated to the systematic looting of cultural property, which catalogues the paintings confiscated from Jewish families in the 1940s. Above it hangs the puffed-up uniform of Hermann Goering, Hitler\u2019s deputy, a white jacket with gold brocading he designed himself. It is an appropriately bloated outfit for a man whose appetite for plundered art saw him acquire three new paintings a week at the height of the Nazi looting, to decorate his own sprawling home. Almost 75 years later, the struggle to find and return the pillaged booty is still ongoing. The exhibition shows an image that Florence\u2019s Uffizi Gallery displayed earlier this year, depicting a painting seized by Nazi troops in 1943 surrounded by banners saying \u201cStolen!\u201d The campaign has paid off: just last week, the descendants of the German soldier who stole the work finally reached an agreement to return it. From the Nazis and the Taliban to Isis\u2019s more recent destruction of Palmyra, there is plenty on the bad guys, but not much space devoted to the more nuanced topic of the damage wrought by the supposed good guys, like the trail of vandalism left by coalition forces in Iraq. It would have been an interesting counterpoint to highlight the fact that, in 2003, US-led troops chose the site of Babylon as the location for their military base, building a depot and helipads on the ruins of the ancient city, renowned for its beauty and splendour a thousand years before Europe built anything comparable. Decorated bricks that formed the famous dragons of the Ishtar Gate were gouged out of the walls, while 2,600-year-old pavements were crushed by military vehicles and vast amounts of earth, mixed with archaeological fragments, were dug up to fill thousands of sandbags. A damning British Museum report at the time described it as \u201ctantamount to establishing a military camp around the Great Pyramid in Egypt or around Stonehenge in Britain\u201d. The army captains could have done with a handy set of Archaeology Awareness playing cards, produced in 2007 by the US Department of Defense in collaboration with Colorado University, on display in an entertaining part of the exhibition about educating soldiers on the importance of cultural heritage. \u201cAncient sites matter to the local community,\u201d says a caption on the Queen of Hearts card, beneath an image of some locals enjoying a site in Uruk, Iraq. \u201cShowing respect wins hearts and minds.\u201d \u201cLOOK WITHOUT LOOTING\u201d was the more direct message given to British soldiers in the second world war, shown on a screen-printed poster alongside the informative \u201cArt \u2013 Its Background\u201d, an improving wall-chart that introduced young recruits to the finer points of El Greco and Van Gogh. As Donald Trump prepares to blunder into an accidental war with Iran, threatening to \u201cobliterate\u201d the country in a recent tirade of tweets, his military aides might do well to familiarise themselves with the ancient cradle of civilisation that produced the wonders of Persepolis, the exquisitely tiled mosques of Isfahan, the mud-walled mansions of Kashan, and the ornate gardens of Shiraz \u2013 before all we have is digitally crowdsourced replicas of them. What Remains is at the Imperial War Memorial, London, from 5 July until 5 January.",

Geoff met Mary Gilhespie when they were both 15; they married in 1955 and went on to have two children. It was also at the age of 15 that Geoff bought his first trumpet, and taught himself to play; his mother had given him piano lessons. After Bristol grammar school he went to Redland teacher training college to study music and education. He first taught English and music at Speedwell secondary school in Bristol, then at South Bristol technical college, while continuing to play music with friends. They formed the Avon Cities Jazz Band in 1949, with their first gig the same year at a Bristol pub. In 1977 Geoff left teaching to open a jazz record shop and later moved to a premises shared with an ironmonger\u2019s. It turned out that turps and nails sold better than Coleman Hawkins, and so he ended up also running the ironmonger\u2019s, alongside his music career. In the early 1980s he began composing classical music for piano and other instruments, as well as settings of poems by Bertolt Brecht, Thomas Hardy, Edward Thomas and William Blake. These were performed at various venues, at home and abroad. In the 90s he formed his own four-piece band, Geoff Nichols\u2019 Good Vibes, in which he played the vibraphone in addition to trumpet. In 2001 he and Mary retired to Minehead, in Somerset, where he was soon playing jazz with a new band. Geoff is survived by Mary, me and my sister, Tessa, and by Peter.",

      "bodyText": "It is five years since Nick Kyrgios beat Rafael Nadal at Wimbledon but somehow it feels like a lifetime ago. At the time it seemed the Australian was a future Wimbledon champion, a star of tomorrow. He was fun, dangerous, different, a breath of fresh air for tennis. Five years on and, while Nadal has just won his 18th grand slam title, Kyrgios remains an enigma, still a box\u2011office draw but his talent in danger of being outshone by on\u2011court misdemeanours. Kyrgios has been fined at Wimbledon for tanking, not making enough effort and in effect throwing away a match. He has been banned from the Tour twice, the first a one-month suspension for sledging Stan Wawrinka with some unsavoury language in Canada in 2015 and the second a two\u2011month ban when he was accused of a lack of effort in Shanghai the following year. He owns a grand slam of fines, picking up penalties at each of the four majors. His ranking, which topped out at No 13 in 2016, has dropped to No 43, with a number of injuries affecting his momentum. He is yet to make it past the quarter-finals of a major. But when he takes on Nadal in the second round tomorrow, there will be some extra spice, thanks to a spat between the two that goes back to Acapulco earlier this year (and perhaps beyond). Kyrgios defeated Nadal on his way to the title in Mexico, after which the Spaniard said Kyrgios was good enough to be contesting for grand slam titles but also that, because of his behaviour on court, he \u201clacks respect for the crowd, his opponent and towards himself\u201d. Kyrgios responded in kind, saying: \u201cI\u2019m different. Rafa\u2019s different. He can focus on what he needs to do. He doesn\u2019t know the journey I\u2019ve been through. He doesn\u2019t know anything about me so I\u2019m not going to listen at all.\u201d In a recent No Challenges Remaining podcast, Kyrgios said Nadal had always been \u201csuper salty\u201d to him off the court and Kyrgios has also been going back and forth with Toni Nadal, the uncle and former coach of Nadal, who accused Kyrgios of a lack of education. After Kyrgios\u2019s five-set win against another Australian, Jordan Thompson, in the first round, he said he could not see Nadal and himself going for a beer at the Dog and Fox, a pub in Wimbledon village.

It is for this reason that I have resigned as Congress president.\u201d </p> <p>Modi\u2019s BJP party won a landslide 300 seats, making huge unexpected gains in traditionally Congress territory.</p> <p>Gandhi, who failed even to secure his own seat in the Congress stronghold of Amethi in Uttar Pradesh, had submitted an internal resignation to the party after the election results came out on 23 May, but was asked by the party\u2019s top brass to remain in his position as Congress president.</p> <p>His resignation, if accepted, will pose an existential question for a party that led India\u2019s struggle for independence from British colonial rule about whether Congress can unify around a common agenda and set of values instead of descendants of a single dynasty.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2007/may/09/india\">Gandhi belongs to a family</a> that has controlled the party since India\u2019s independence. His great-grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru was India\u2019s first prime minister, his grandmother <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/indira-gandhi\">Indira Gandhi</a> was India\u2019s prime minister for a decade from 1966 to 1977 and then again from 1980 until her assassination in 1984, and his father, Rajiv Gandhi, was prime minister from 1984 to 1989.</p> <p>But despite its gilded legacy the Congress party\u2019s modern image has become associated with corruption scandals, broken promises and a lack of vision.</p> <p>During the election campaign, India\u2019s incumbent prime minister, Modi, targeted his criticism of the Congress party directly at Gandhi, the baby-faced Oxford-educated heir whose position as party president seemed to critics to be inherited, not earned.</p> <p>Gandhi\u2019s media appearances and political gaffes compounded the image that Modi painted of a man unqualified to govern India, the world\u2019s most populous democracy. Meanwhile, Modi\u2019s own rise to India\u2019s highest office despite his humble origins as a railway station tea server resonated with millions of Indians, as the country experiences rapid economic transformation.</p> <p>In his resignation statement, Gandhi said he was not going to nominate the party\u2019s next president. Instead, he urged his party\u2019s working committee to nominate its next leader and to \u201cradically transform itself\u201d.</p> <p>Gandhi used his parting statement to deliver searing criticism of Modi\u2019s BJP. He wrote: \u201cWe didn\u2019t fight a political party in the 2019 election. Rather, we fought the entire machinery of the Indian state, every institution which was marshalled against the opposition. It is now crystal clear that our once cherished institutional neutrality no longer exists in India.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Rahul Gandhi, the political scion of India\u2019s most powerful ruling dynasty, has announced his resignation as president of India\u2019s opposition Congress party in the wake of a catastrophic defeat in national elections in May. In a tweet on Wednesday, Gandhi said he accepted responsibility for his party\u2019s electoral failure against the governing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party of the prime minister, Narendra Modi. \u201cAs president of the Congress party I am responsible for the loss of the 2019 election. It is for this reason that I have resigned as Congress president.\u201d Modi\u2019s BJP party won a landslide 300 seats, making huge unexpected gains in traditionally Congress territory. Gandhi, who failed even to secure his own seat in the Congress stronghold of Amethi in Uttar Pradesh, had submitted an internal resignation to the party after the election results came out on 23 May, but was asked by the party\u2019s top brass to remain in his position as Congress president. His resignation, if accepted, will pose an existential question for a party that led India\u2019s struggle for independence from British colonial rule about whether Congress can unify around a common agenda and set of values instead of descendants of a single dynasty. Gandhi belongs to a family that has controlled the party since India\u2019s independence. His great-grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru was India\u2019s first prime minister, his grandmother Indira Gandhi was India\u2019s prime minister for a decade from 1966 to 1977 and then again from 1980 until her assassination in 1984, and his father, Rajiv Gandhi, was prime minister from 1984 to 1989. But despite its gilded legacy the Congress party\u2019s modern image has become associated with corruption scandals, broken promises and a lack of vision. During the election campaign, India\u2019s incumbent prime minister, Modi, targeted his criticism of the Congress party directly at Gandhi, the baby-faced Oxford-educated heir whose position as party president seemed to critics to be inherited, not earned. Gandhi\u2019s media appearances and political gaffes compounded the image that Modi painted of a man unqualified to govern India, the world\u2019s most populous democracy. Meanwhile, Modi\u2019s own rise to India\u2019s highest office despite his humble origins as a railway station tea server resonated with millions of Indians, as the country experiences rapid economic transformation. In his resignation statement, Gandhi said he was not going to nominate the party\u2019s next president. Instead, he urged his party\u2019s working committee to nominate its next leader and to \u201cradically transform itself\u201d. Gandhi used his parting statement to deliver searing criticism of Modi\u2019s BJP. He wrote: \u201cWe didn\u2019t fight a political party in the 2019 election. Rather, we fought the entire machinery of the Indian state, every institution which was marshalled against the opposition. It is now crystal clear that our once cherished institutional neutrality no longer exists in India.\u201d",

Lawmakers have summoned industry representatives to parliament and two commercial sponsors have pulled their support amid public revulsion at the revelations, which detailed doping and other abuses. RT\u00c9 Investigates: Greyhounds Running for Their Lives last week reported that 5,987 greyhounds were slaughtered in 2017 because they failed to make qualification times or their performance had declined. The documentary found that many were culled at knackeries \u2013 with one company saying it shot dogs in bulk \u2013 in breach of a regulation that only veterinary practitioners can euthanise greyhounds. The programme also documented the use of performance-enhancing drugs in illegal hare coursing, with one vet saying he had seen dogs with so much erythropoietin (EPO) that \u201ctheir blood is like treacle\u201d. A business analysis report commissioned by the industry in 2017 found that it was breeding 1,000% more puppies than it needed, according to the documentary. On Tuesday, FBD Insurance and Barry\u2019s Tea announced they were ending sponsorship of greyhound races and urged the industry to improve animal welfare. Barry\u2019s Tea said it was \u201csaddened and horrified\u201d by the revelations. The companies were relatively minor sponsors but are household names. The move put pressure on bigger sponsors such as the bookmaker Boylesports. It said it was \u201cappalled\u201d by the programme\u2019s revelations. State support for the industry, which has suffered dwindling attendance, is also under scrutiny. The department of agriculture is set to give \u20ac16.8m to the Irish Greyhound Board this year. A parliamentary committee on agriculture ordered the board and the Irish Coursing Club to appear at a hearing next week to discuss reforms. The Irish Greyhound Board blamed the abuses on an \u201cirresponsible minority\u201d within the industry that it vowed to root out. In a statement, the board said it had adopted new safeguards. \u201cThe IGB is now arranging for the implementation of these schemes. The welfare of greyhounds remains a priority for IGB and we will continue to build on the reforms within the sector over the last number of years.\u201d Last month, animal welfare charities in the UK renewed calls to end greyhound racing in Britain after the industry published figures showing that almost 1,000 racing greyhounds died or were killed last year.",

      "body": "<p>At about 5pm on the hottest day of the year I was to be found clambering reluctantly into my little-used black tie attire. Ahead of me was an evening way out of my comfort zone: a leavers\u2019 ball at a reassuringly expensive boarding school luxuriating in pastures green somewhere to the north-east of London. When you live on the western flank of the city, that\u2019s an awful long way round.</p> <p>I am the worst kind of hypocrite when it comes to private education. I can boast \u2013 and I do boast \u2013 about my state education. But my school was in a relatively middle-class community outside Birmingham; I wanted for nothing there. When my dad made some money, a plan was hatched to send my brother and me to something called, mysteriously, a \u201cprep\u201d school. We went to visit it. It looked like the kind of stately home we would be dragged round if we had people staying. We weren\u2019t keen. We were ushered around by someone who, forbiddingly, called himself a \u201cmaster\u201d. At one point he said: \u201cYes, we push them very hard here.\u201d My brother and I had heard enough. We fought tooth and nail over most things, but on this we were united. We moaned and sulked and threatened a sustained campaign of domestic disobedience. Sense was soon seen and we remained where we belonged, in a perfectly good state school.</p> <p>As for my kids, they went to the local state primary school and then, at 11, to a nearby fee-paying girls\u2019 school. It wasn\u2019t my idea, but I didn\u2019t push a better one. Don\u2019t judge me \u2013 or, actually, do judge me. Throw stuff at me in the street if you like, for parents such as me, the ones who cannot defend private education but then send their kids there, are the worst.</p> <p>Anyway, back to this leavers\u2019 ball.

      "bodyText": "At about 5pm on the hottest day of the year I was to be found clambering reluctantly into my little-used black tie attire. Ahead of me was an evening way out of my comfort zone: a leavers\u2019 ball at a reassuringly expensive boarding school luxuriating in pastures green somewhere to the north-east of London. When you live on the western flank of the city, that\u2019s an awful long way round. I am the worst kind of hypocrite when it comes to private education. I can boast \u2013 and I do boast \u2013 about my state education. But my school was in a relatively middle-class community outside Birmingham; I wanted for nothing there. When my dad made some money, a plan was hatched to send my brother and me to something called, mysteriously, a \u201cprep\u201d school. We went to visit it. It looked like the kind of stately home we would be dragged round if we had people staying. We weren\u2019t keen. We were ushered around by someone who, forbiddingly, called himself a \u201cmaster\u201d. At one point he said: \u201cYes, we push them very hard here.\u201d My brother and I had heard enough. We fought tooth and nail over most things, but on this we were united. We moaned and sulked and threatened a sustained campaign of domestic disobedience. Sense was soon seen and we remained where we belonged, in a perfectly good state school. As for my kids, they went to the local state primary school and then, at 11, to a nearby fee-paying girls\u2019 school. It wasn\u2019t my idea, but I didn\u2019t push a better one. Don\u2019t judge me \u2013 or, actually, do judge me. Throw stuff at me in the street if you like, for parents such as me, the ones who cannot defend private education but then send their kids there, are the worst. Anyway, back to this leavers\u2019 ball. The leaver in question was my friend\u2019s son, who I care for very much. Walking through the gates felt like walking on to a location for a film in which every boarding school cliche had been overdone. There was a beautiful old building with an imposing clock tower eyeing the scene. Across an immaculate cricket pitch stood a splendid marquee, in front of which, parents and their now come-of-age sons and daughters gaily clinked glasses. I hugged our boy and he said: \u201cSee that clock face?

Maybe I could, but it wouldn\u2019t be fair. Everyone I spoke to was charmed and charming, interesting and interested.

If you trust the 4-3-3 when times are bad, go with it. Lo and behold, England got more players high up the pitch, created more chances and worried USA\u2019s backline.

      "body": "<p>The game between the United States and England took women\u2019s football to another level. It had everything you could want in a semi-final: two VAR decisions; great goals by Ellen White (OK, with one pulled back for offside); a penalty; a penalty save; surprise line-up changes; a tactical battle between the two managers, and, unfortunately for England, heartbroken fans. </p> \n<p>This World Cup was a turning point for the women\u2019s game in England. The team have won a lot of respect around the world for their talent and the way they play. Since 2015 they have addressed some of the issues that have held them back for so long. The next goal if they want to really succeed is to work on the fine details that make the difference between winning and losing at the highest level.</p> \n<p>All three goals (four, if you include the one called offside) in the game came from horrible defending. I said from the beginning of the tournament that this was not going to be a competition with fantastic defending and that\u2019s what we got in the semi-final. England \u2013 as well as the US \u2013 obviously need to tidy up their backline but, importantly, I really want to see England convert their penalties.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/03/england-usa-world-cup-defence-phil-neville-tactics\">England crash out after shift in tactics and failure to fix defensive flaws | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Nikita Parris missed two spot-kicks during this tournament. Ellen White \u2013 who is their main goalscorer \u2013 doesn\u2019t feel comfortable taking them. So it was up to the captain, Steph Houghton, a defender and not a specialist penalty taker, to do the right thing and step up to take the crucial kick against the US. That took courage but Steph didn\u2019t look confident before she took the kick even if Phil Neville said after the game that England had practised hundreds of penalties. Watching from the other side of the pitch, I knew from the way she lined up in front of the ball that she was going to go to the goalkeeper\u2019s right. That\u2019s what goalkeepers are taught to see. Top penalty takers are also taught how to disguise which direction they will shoot. It\u2019s these details that make the difference. To compound things, Steph also mishit the kick. There was no pace on the ball and it was not placed in the corner, making it easy for a well-trained goalkeeper to save. </p> \n<p>In my experience with the US team, we worked on penalties a year out from any tournament. Every day after practice we would all take a penalty \u2013 and that included us goalkeepers. Players get more comfortable and more confident over time. The coaches keep records about how players responded to penalty kicks and what they did in training. Those little details are what England seemed to neglect and can be the difference at the highest level.</p> \n<p>Alyssa Naeher had a great save in the first-half to confirm that no one is going to score against an American goalkeeper from outside the box. American goalkeepers are well trained and historically very strong, an area in which England have struggled down the years. It has been great to see Alyssa gain more confidence as the tournament has gone on.</p> \n<p>Starting Christen Press was a great decision from Jill Ellis. Christen can run up and down the sideline forever: she\u2019s fit, she\u2019s fast, and she scores goals. She should have played more minutes across the whole tournament by now, though. It\u2019s been strange to see Carli Lloyd, who came into the England game as a late substitute, go from being the US team\u2019s goalscorer to being the closer in tight games. That shows how much attention is being paid to game management by the US, and how much Carli\u2019s calming presence, ability to hold the ball and intelligence is needed when the game gets hectic and stressful.</p> \n<p>That said, people have told me they want to see the US keep possession and go for another goal to close out a game. Instead, the tactic seems to be conservative: put five defenders at the back and head for the corner flag with the ball and wind down the clock.

      "bodyText": "The game between the United States and England took women\u2019s football to another level. It had everything you could want in a semi-final: two VAR decisions; great goals by Ellen White (OK, with one pulled back for offside); a penalty; a penalty save; surprise line-up changes; a tactical battle between the two managers, and, unfortunately for England, heartbroken fans. This World Cup was a turning point for the women\u2019s game in England. The team have won a lot of respect around the world for their talent and the way they play. Since 2015 they have addressed some of the issues that have held them back for so long. The next goal if they want to really succeed is to work on the fine details that make the difference between winning and losing at the highest level. All three goals (four, if you include the one called offside) in the game came from horrible defending. I said from the beginning of the tournament that this was not going to be a competition with fantastic defending and that\u2019s what we got in the semi-final. England \u2013 as well as the US \u2013 obviously need to tidy up their backline but, importantly, I really want to see England convert their penalties. Nikita Parris missed two spot-kicks during this tournament. Ellen White \u2013 who is their main goalscorer \u2013 doesn\u2019t feel comfortable taking them. So it was up to the captain, Steph Houghton, a defender and not a specialist penalty taker, to do the right thing and step up to take the crucial kick against the US. That took courage but Steph didn\u2019t look confident before she took the kick even if Phil Neville said after the game that England had practised hundreds of penalties. Watching from the other side of the pitch, I knew from the way she lined up in front of the ball that she was going to go to the goalkeeper\u2019s right. That\u2019s what goalkeepers are taught to see. Top penalty takers are also taught how to disguise which direction they will shoot. It\u2019s these details that make the difference. To compound things, Steph also mishit the kick. There was no pace on the ball and it was not placed in the corner, making it easy for a well-trained goalkeeper to save. In my experience with the US team, we worked on penalties a year out from any tournament. Every day after practice we would all take a penalty \u2013 and that included us goalkeepers. Players get more comfortable and more confident over time. The coaches keep records about how players responded to penalty kicks and what they did in training. Those little details are what England seemed to neglect and can be the difference at the highest level. Alyssa Naeher had a great save in the first-half to confirm that no one is going to score against an American goalkeeper from outside the box. American goalkeepers are well trained and historically very strong, an area in which England have struggled down the years. It has been great to see Alyssa gain more confidence as the tournament has gone on. Starting Christen Press was a great decision from Jill Ellis. Christen can run up and down the sideline forever: she\u2019s fit, she\u2019s fast, and she scores goals. She should have played more minutes across the whole tournament by now, though. It\u2019s been strange to see Carli Lloyd, who came into the England game as a late substitute, go from being the US team\u2019s goalscorer to being the closer in tight games. That shows how much attention is being paid to game management by the US, and how much Carli\u2019s calming presence, ability to hold the ball and intelligence is needed when the game gets hectic and stressful. That said, people have told me they want to see the US keep possession and go for another goal to close out a game. Instead, the tactic seems to be conservative: put five defenders at the back and head for the corner flag with the ball and wind down the clock. I understand why that can be a good idea but the message I get is that people would love to see the US play football for 90 minutes. We have quality players who can play with style and lock down the game in a less conservative way. Rose Lavelle has really made a name for herself in France. So many people are asking me to tell them all I know about her and I was sorry to see her leave the field injured. She will have just as big a mental challenge as physical to be ready for the final. If she gets fit in time she might still question her body and if she misses the final it will be heartbreaking for her \u2013 and fans. That\u2019s why some US players will now be happy there are a few days break until the final. Crystal Dunn and Tobin Heath can run and run but Megan Rapinoe will benefit from some extra time out. Megan should look at missing the semi-final as a positive step towards having an amazing game in the final.

      "bodyText": "Ottawa is relaxed, but at the same time an adrenaline-seeker\u2019s dream. It\u2019s funky and kitsch and yet effortlessly cool with brewing, dining and arts scenes to rival anywhere in North America \u2013 and its absolute best comes in the summer months. Cruising the Rideau canal While Ottawa\u2019s Rideau canal plays host to hundreds of daily ice skaters carving across its frozen surface during winter months, the Unesco world heritage site is just as appealing in summer. Jump aboard Rideau Canal Cruises\u2019 fully electric barge \u2013 the only vessel of its kind in North America \u2013 and savour the perfect vantage point for some of Ottawa\u2019s most scenic spots. You can take in Lansdowne Park and Dow\u2019s Lake to the south and the gothic revival splendour of the Fairmont Ch\u00e2teau Laurier hotel closer to downtown. Political manoeuvring \u2013 with a twist Zen can be found in surprising pockets of Ottawa but none more surprising than in its very epicentre \u2013 Parliament Hill. Inside the doors of the nation\u2019s halls of power, things may be particularly frenetic with a federal election coming up this autumn, but on the lawn outside the stunning house of commons, things are decidedly more chill every Wednesday afternoon. The free weekly yoga class is an absolute must for yogis and non-yogis of all abilities. Even prime minister Justin Trudeau, an enthusiast himself, has stopped in at a class or two. Just bring a mat \u2013 and some sunscreen \u2013 and get your downward dog on while the politicians get their debate on inside. Brewing up a storm When former US president Barack Obama rekindled his bromance with Trudeau during a visit to the capital earlier this summer, it was pretty fitting that the pair caught up at a brewery. Ottawa is teeming with taphouses pouring out some of Canada\u2019s best brews. Obama and Trudeau opted for Big Rig Brewing where they sampled the Canadian Amber and Alpha Bomb IPA respectively. But there is hoppy goodness to be found across the city. Beyond the Pale in Little Italy is a gem with great eats to soak up even better beers, while Canada\u2019s first Kickstarter-funded brewery, Dominion City, is so worth the trip to the east end. Can\u2019t decide between the options? Then let the experts at Brew Donkey guide you on an always-fun brewery bus tour. The best season? Patio season Summer is patio season. There\u2019s nowhere better to enjoy those great local beers or some of the best cuisine in Canada than in the open air. The uber-stylish Andaz hotel in the ByWard Market may lay claim to the city\u2019s best patio, a rooftop escape that offers stunning views. But there are scores of rivals. Tavern on the Falls boasts soothing waterfall views, while Tooth and Nail Brewing Co has a recently opened sun-kissed courtyard to go with great beers. The Brig Pub may have the most Insta-perfect open-air space of all \u2013 a canopy of hanging greenery that still leaves gaps for blue skies to pierce through. Sounds of summer The capital reverberates to music all summer long. Bluesfest is the biggest and boldest festival of the summer and boasts much more than just blues. Headliners this year include the Killers, Alt-J, Wu-Tang Clan and the Backstreet Boys. But from June through to September there really is something for everyone: Escapade sates all EDM lovers\u2019 appetites; Chamberfest is the world\u2019s biggest chamber music festival; there are five days of fireworks at the Canadian Museum of History with the Sound of Light competition and, yes, there is also a 10-day jazz festival that features some of the world\u2019s biggest acts. Please the palate at a walking pace Ottawa\u2019s food scene \u2013 a melting pot that bubbles over with flavours and aromas \u2013 is as diverse as its population. The city ranges from award-winning fine dining to adventurous ethnic holes in the wall, with plenty in between. But there are so many funky new places opening up that wrangling them all in can seem like a challenge. So why not pass the job off to someone else by joining a walking food tour? C\u2019est Bon Cooking offers great guides to the city\u2019s food culture, snaking through the top foodie neighbourhoods.

Having for so long resembled a human portcullis with a series of last-ditch tackles and blocks throughout the tournament, Steph Houghton was forced into the role of unwitting villain, choosing to eschew the option of unleashing one of her trademark set-piece thunderbolts from the spot with seven minutes to go and allowing Alyssa Naeher to save a surprisingly poor effort. \u201cI\u2019ve been taking them in training every single day, and I believed in my technique but today I just got it wrong, and let my team down,\u201d she said, in a post-match interview that was interrupted by one of the famously humble USA! USA!! USA!!! players. \u201cWell there was no need for that! Ridiculous!\u201d seethed the unimpressed England captain, as Lindsey Horan brayed, whooped and hollered like a Donald Trump supporter just behind her. Earlier in the evening, USA! USA!! USA!!! goalscorer Alex Morgan had sparked online outrage that was bizarre even by the standards of Social Media Disgrace Twitter, when she raised a pinkie and appeared to mime sipping a cup of tea as part of her goal celebration. While she refused to be drawn on the meaning behind the gesture (if you\u2019re old like us, this might help \u2013 Fiver Ed), those desperate to be offended viewed it as a dig at English culture. If that was the case, she could have made her feelings more clear by miming drinking 17 pints on a Friday night out, then staggering home via the kebab shop. While bad news for England\u2019s likeable players and their fans, their elimination from the World Cup will come as something of a relief to their army of tedious detractors. So angered at having these easily avoidable matches repeatedly forced down their throats, they felt constantly compelled to bore everyone with news that they weren\u2019t watching. Unlike the 53,000 spectators at the game and a peak audience of 11.7 million TV viewers back home, they missed a cracking game from the sanctuary of mum\u2019s spare bedroom. For England, now, there is the small-but-not-insignificant matter of Saturday\u2019s third-place play-off, a match their own visibly gutted players might also prefer to avoid. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE!

      "body": "<h2>\u2018It means a lot to a girl who was told football was for boys\u2019</h2> <p>It\u2019s changed my (male) partner\u2019s view of women\u2019s football. He didn\u2019t know much about it before and assumed the women\u2019s game must be somehow \u201cless exciting\u201d because it\u2019s not as popular, but he\u2019s really enjoyed watching the World Cup with me \u2013 even if I get a bit vocal sometimes!</p> <p>He\u2019s also become a big proponent of equality for the Lionesses and thinks women\u2019s football should be put on level standing with the men\u2019s game. He\u2019s even taken to social media to call for more coverage of the women\u2019s leagues, fair pay and more funding for the sport. I\u2019m so proud of him! I\u2019m hoping the success of our amazing Lionesses will mean they are given the respect they deserve. It means a lot to a girl who was told at school in the early 1980s that she couldn\u2019t play football because it was a \u2018boys sport\u2019. <strong>Jen, South Yorkshire</strong></p> <h2>\u2018The tournament has been an opportunity to be with friends\u2019</h2> <p>We usually get together in a boozer to watch the England men\u2019s team, but this is the first time we\u2019ve watched a women\u2019s match together. The whole tournament has been an opportunity to be with friends and send mild abuse to my American in-laws! I\u2019ll be over in California with them for the final on Sunday so, against my natural instincts, I\u2019ll be supporting USA. <strong>Andy Bartlett, London</strong></p> <h2>\u2018I have arranged my social life around watching the games\u2019</h2> <p>The tournament has changed my perception of the women\u2019s game completely. Prior to the tournament I\u2019d have struggled to name more than a few of the England squad, but now some of them are among my sporting heroes.</p> <p>We travelled to Nice to watch England\u2019s opener against Scotland and for the last month I have arranged my social life around watching the games. My levels of excitement and nerves have reached a level not far off those experienced during last summer\u2019s World Cup. I\u2019m already making plans to attend some Women\u2019s Super League games next season \u2013 something I had never previously considered.Before long, this World Cup will be seen as a significant turning point in women\u2019s sport and the fight for gender equality in football. I\u2019m thrilled to have experienced it so closely along the way. <strong>Grant, 29, London</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd34c94109f4f7bbf8667f5b45db26098c3c7dfd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd34c94109f4f7bbf8667f5b45db26098c3c7dfd/0_240_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grant with Emelia, Giles and Lauren before England v Scotland in Nice.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grant with Emelia, Giles and Lauren before England v Scotland in Nice.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Grant/Guardian Community</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018I\u2019ve finally gotten a few male friends to take it seriously\u2019</h2> <p>The tournament hasn\u2019t been a massive change for me. I\u2019ve been a fan since the 1970s, when I played in a competitive league as a young girl. But I\u2019ve finally gotten a few male friends to take it seriously. They\u2019ve appreciated the lack of theatrics as a whole (some still happen, but not to the degree of the men\u2019s game). I\u2019m hoping USA win so my team can thumb their noses at our ridiculous president! <strong>Julie B, Minneapolis</strong></p> <h2>\u2018The women\u2019s game is better than the men\u2019s game\u2019</h2> <p>Watching the World Cup has without a doubt changed how I see women\u2019s football. The game is better than the men\u2019s game! Although a little slower, accuracy of passing is better, there are fewer fouls and fewer histrionics. This season I\u2019ll definitely attempt to watch more Manchester United women\u2019s games. They\u2019ve only had one season and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/01/manchester-united-city-debut-wsl-match\">have been promoted to the same league as Manchester City</a>, so it\u2019ll be interesting to see how they compare with the men. I\u2019m a season ticket holder at Old Trafford and will now make more of an effort to support the women. <strong>Harry Bloom, Glossop</strong></p> <h2>\u2018I finally understand the attraction of football\u2019</h2> <p>This World Cup has changed how I view football, let alone the women\u2019s game! I used to follow Liverpool as a kid, but went off football as I grew up. The games are so stop-start and and the players are spoilt and are paid obscene amounts of money. I started watching the Women\u2019s World Cup to encourage my kids and now I\u2019m hooked.</p> <p>It\u2019s all so easy to watch and so relatable. Most of all I love seeing what bodies like mine can do \u2013 it\u2019s amazing to see a female body used for strength and power instead of boring old sexiness. It feels like real, interesting people out there playing the game. And every player has an inspirational story to tell about overcoming difficulties and prejudice. How can I pick one team to support when they\u2019re all so engaging?</p> <p>For the first time, I finally understand the attraction of football. These teams have shown me what a fantastic game it is \u2013 the skill, passion, strategy and endurance. It means my daughters can see what their female bodies can do. The World Cup has given them dozens of strong, tough role models who can show them the way forward. <strong>Sarah Hames-Clarke, Bolton-by-Bowland</strong></p> <h2>\u2018I walked away from football because I didn\u2019t feel like I belonged\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019ve always loved the Women\u2019s World Cup. This year, however, there\u2019s something more in it for me as it feels like the most diverse tournament I\u2019ve ever seen. That matters to me because I walked away from football because I didn\u2019t feel like I belonged. Basketball was practically shoved down my throat when I was a kid but when I discovered \u201csoccer\u201d \u2013 thanks largely to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/18/womens-world-cup-game-changing-moments-no-3-china-in-1991\">the Mia Hamm craze of the late 1990s</a> \u2013 I was in love and convinced I\u2019d found my sport.</p> <p>But then I enrolled in an elite private high school and was the only black girl on the field. I left tryouts full of shame, convinced I had no business being there. No one made fun of me, but there was an embarrassment and loneliness that was unbearable and I was already anxious about being a black girl from the wrong side of town in the predominantly white, upper-class environment.

      "bodyText": "\u2018It means a lot to a girl who was told football was for boys\u2019 It\u2019s changed my (male) partner\u2019s view of women\u2019s football. He didn\u2019t know much about it before and assumed the women\u2019s game must be somehow \u201cless exciting\u201d because it\u2019s not as popular, but he\u2019s really enjoyed watching the World Cup with me \u2013 even if I get a bit vocal sometimes! He\u2019s also become a big proponent of equality for the Lionesses and thinks women\u2019s football should be put on level standing with the men\u2019s game. He\u2019s even taken to social media to call for more coverage of the women\u2019s leagues, fair pay and more funding for the sport. I\u2019m so proud of him! I\u2019m hoping the success of our amazing Lionesses will mean they are given the respect they deserve. It means a lot to a girl who was told at school in the early 1980s that she couldn\u2019t play football because it was a \u2018boys sport\u2019. Jen, South Yorkshire \u2018The tournament has been an opportunity to be with friends\u2019 We usually get together in a boozer to watch the England men\u2019s team, but this is the first time we\u2019ve watched a women\u2019s match together. The whole tournament has been an opportunity to be with friends and send mild abuse to my American in-laws! I\u2019ll be over in California with them for the final on Sunday so, against my natural instincts, I\u2019ll be supporting USA. Andy Bartlett, London \u2018I have arranged my social life around watching the games\u2019 The tournament has changed my perception of the women\u2019s game completely. Prior to the tournament I\u2019d have struggled to name more than a few of the England squad, but now some of them are among my sporting heroes. We travelled to Nice to watch England\u2019s opener against Scotland and for the last month I have arranged my social life around watching the games. My levels of excitement and nerves have reached a level not far off those experienced during last summer\u2019s World Cup. I\u2019m already making plans to attend some Women\u2019s Super League games next season \u2013 something I had never previously considered.Before long, this World Cup will be seen as a significant turning point in women\u2019s sport and the fight for gender equality in football. I\u2019m thrilled to have experienced it so closely along the way. Grant, 29, London \u2018I\u2019ve finally gotten a few male friends to take it seriously\u2019 The tournament hasn\u2019t been a massive change for me. I\u2019ve been a fan since the 1970s, when I played in a competitive league as a young girl. But I\u2019ve finally gotten a few male friends to take it seriously. They\u2019ve appreciated the lack of theatrics as a whole (some still happen, but not to the degree of the men\u2019s game). I\u2019m hoping USA win so my team can thumb their noses at our ridiculous president! Julie B, Minneapolis \u2018The women\u2019s game is better than the men\u2019s game\u2019 Watching the World Cup has without a doubt changed how I see women\u2019s football. The game is better than the men\u2019s game! Although a little slower, accuracy of passing is better, there are fewer fouls and fewer histrionics. This season I\u2019ll definitely attempt to watch more Manchester United women\u2019s games. They\u2019ve only had one season and have been promoted to the same league as Manchester City, so it\u2019ll be interesting to see how they compare with the men. I\u2019m a season ticket holder at Old Trafford and will now make more of an effort to support the women. Harry Bloom, Glossop \u2018I finally understand the attraction of football\u2019 This World Cup has changed how I view football, let alone the women\u2019s game! I used to follow Liverpool as a kid, but went off football as I grew up. The games are so stop-start and and the players are spoilt and are paid obscene amounts of money. I started watching the Women\u2019s World Cup to encourage my kids and now I\u2019m hooked. It\u2019s all so easy to watch and so relatable. Most of all I love seeing what bodies like mine can do \u2013 it\u2019s amazing to see a female body used for strength and power instead of boring old sexiness. It feels like real, interesting people out there playing the game. And every player has an inspirational story to tell about overcoming difficulties and prejudice. How can I pick one team to support when they\u2019re all so engaging? For the first time, I finally understand the attraction of football. These teams have shown me what a fantastic game it is \u2013 the skill, passion, strategy and endurance. It means my daughters can see what their female bodies can do. The World Cup has given them dozens of strong, tough role models who can show them the way forward. Sarah Hames-Clarke, Bolton-by-Bowland \u2018I walked away from football because I didn\u2019t feel like I belonged\u2019 I\u2019ve always loved the Women\u2019s World Cup. This year, however, there\u2019s something more in it for me as it feels like the most diverse tournament I\u2019ve ever seen. That matters to me because I walked away from football because I didn\u2019t feel like I belonged. Basketball was practically shoved down my throat when I was a kid but when I discovered \u201csoccer\u201d \u2013 thanks largely to the Mia Hamm craze of the late 1990s \u2013 I was in love and convinced I\u2019d found my sport. But then I enrolled in an elite private high school and was the only black girl on the field. I left tryouts full of shame, convinced I had no business being there. No one made fun of me, but there was an embarrassment and loneliness that was unbearable and I was already anxious about being a black girl from the wrong side of town in the predominantly white, upper-class environment. I never returned to the game and it\u2019s something I\u2019ll regret for the rest of my life. I am thrilled at how many black women and women of colour are at this World Cup. From the powerful story of the Reggae Girlz, to Wendie Renard and, of course, Crystal Dunn. The feeling of joy I get seeing this representation is indescribable. There are very few occasions when women are celebrated at an equal or comparable level as men. As a 29-year-old from US, I\u2019ve seen women fight to be taken as seriously as men in music, business, the culinary field, writing, film and, of course, sports for nearly 30 years.

One of the best-known is <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2ITzOoz\" rel=\"nofollow\">Martin Picard\u2019s Cabane au Sucre</a> and you should visit during the harvest season of mid-August to the end of October.

In 1970, to celebrate the centennial of Northwest Territories, the government introduced a number plate shaped like a polar bear. Sure, some may have thought it was unusual at first.

Well then, listen up because we have a tale for you. Legend has it that Ogopogo inhabits Lake Okanagan in the BC interior. This creature has been described as a \u201cgiant snake\u201d about 50 feet long, lurking in the dark expanse of the lake. While there have been sightings dating as far back as the 19th century, the most recent was in September 2018. From the lake, drive to the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/31WHbCV\" rel=\"nofollow\">Okanagan Spirits Craft Distillery</a> to learn a bit more about western Canada\u2019s oldest craft distillery, and take a whisky tour. Alternatively, check out one of the latest local theatre shows at the <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2xmo7zT\" rel=\"nofollow\">Caravan Farm Theatre</a> under the stars. Located on a 32-hectare (80-acre) farm, it\u2019s a hidden treasure and one of the best ways to support local artists.

They use natural ingredients and have been known to offer unique flavours such as roasted garlic and asiago cheese or rosemary and lavender. We have to wonder what Homer Simpson would order! In Newfoundland, Canada, the Atlantic Ocean can freeze, creating nature\u2019s hockey rink We all know that hockey is Canada\u2019s national sport, so it only makes sense that in Newfoundland and Labrador (and many other provinces and territories) they encourage outdoor ice hockey. During the winter months, people are invited to put their mitts together and throw the puck down for a friendly game. But better act fast: outdoor rinks are weather dependent \u2013 come visit in winter and experience something truly Canadian. Qu\u00e9bec manufactures more than 77% of the world\u2019s maple syrup You haven\u2019t had maple syrup until you\u2019ve visited the sugar shacks in Qu\u00e9bec. The province is home to hundreds of the best sugar shacks, where you can enjoy maple syrup all year round. One of the best-known is Martin Picard\u2019s Cabane au Sucre and you should visit during the harvest season of mid-August to the end of October. In its prime, you can see the producers in action, sample sap and syrup and enjoy lots of family fun. The sugar season runs from mid-February to early May, and this is when the syrup begins to flow in full force. If you can\u2019t get to Martin Picard\u2019s, we suggest visiting \u00c9rabli\u00e8re Au Sous-Bois (Mont-Saint-Gr\u00e9goire, QC) or Sucrerie de la Montagne (Riguad, QC) \u2013 they offer a variety of activities including carriage rides, guided tours of the shack and tastings. While you\u2019re there, don\u2019t forget to buy a bottle (or two) to eat on everything from pancakes to baked beans, or drizzle into your coffee or tea. It\u2019s considered liquid gold here in Canada. Want a polar bear-shaped number plate? You\u2019ll have to move to, or at least visit, the Northwest Territories to make it happen In Canada\u2019s Northwest Territories, polar bears abound \u2013 in the form of number plates. In 1970, to celebrate the centennial of Northwest Territories, the government introduced a number plate shaped like a polar bear. Sure, some may have thought it was unusual at first. But since then, many have become delighted and wanted one for themselves. Pro tip: we\u2019ve seen some vintage plates sold on eBay. If you want to branch out into road signs, then there are more than 77,000 to be seen at Watson Lake Signpost Forest. Travellers have been bringing signposts from their hometowns since 1942 and you can carry on that tradition with one of your own. Ogopogo is a mythical monster similar to the Loch Ness monster that supposedly lives in Lake Okanagan, British Columbia Do you believe in folklore and mystery? Well then, listen up because we have a tale for you. Legend has it that Ogopogo inhabits Lake Okanagan in the BC interior. This creature has been described as a \u201cgiant snake\u201d about 50 feet long, lurking in the dark expanse of the lake. While there have been sightings dating as far back as the 19th century, the most recent was in September 2018. From the lake, drive to the Okanagan Spirits Craft Distillery to learn a bit more about western Canada\u2019s oldest craft distillery, and take a whisky tour. Alternatively, check out one of the latest local theatre shows at the Caravan Farm Theatre under the stars. Located on a 32-hectare (80-acre) farm, it\u2019s a hidden treasure and one of the best ways to support local artists. If you want to see if you can sneak a peek of Ogopogo, why not try scuba diving at Fintry provincial park? It also houses a sunken Canadian Pacific Railway barge, should you not get lucky with the monster. Did you know that Santa Claus had a legitimate postal address? Send your letter to \u201cH0H 0H0, North Pole, Canada\u201d for free, in any language. Those with a return address will receive a letter back, from Santa\u2019s elves Each and every single year as a child, it was a tradition to write a letter to Santa. At Canada Post, they have set up a system to ensure that every child who writes from home gets a personal response from Saint Nick. The postal service received a record-breaking 1.6m letters in 2017, so if you\u2019ve ever wanted your own letter from the big guy in red, now\u2019s your chance! Ever dreamed of spotting beluga whales? Get yourself to Churchill, Manitoba If there is one thing you need to know, it\u2019s that Churchill, Manitoba, is known for its abundance of Canadian wildlife. Many belugas migrate through Hudson Bay in the months of July and August, when tens of thousands pass through the area. Thanks to Sea North Tours, you\u2019ll be able to have the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to hear belugas singing through hydrophones \u2013 you can listen to their whistles and squeals while observing their majestic beauty from boats that have no moving parts that can harm the whales. The province where Anne of Green Gables was set, Prince Edward Island is just 140 miles long and 35 miles wide Fun fact: as one of Canada\u2019s three Maritime provinces, Prince Edward Island is the smallest. Not only can it lay claim to being the smallest in land area, but also in population of the three. The province, however, takes it in its stride, with the motto being \u201cParva sub ingenti\u201d (The small under the protection of the great). There are few places more unusual than Basin Head provincial park, which is perhaps better known as Singing Sands, because the pure white sands do just that. Due to the high silica content, when heated by the sun, the sand produces a high-pitched squeaking sound when walked across \u2013 and endless fun. For a period of time, Canada suffered a shortage of coins. So, while they worked to produce more, playing cards were used as currency In the late 1600s, coins arriving from France were in short supply. This meant that as Canada worked hard to get more currency in, playing cards took the place of coins to keep the economy going. The Royal Canadian Mint made a nod to this in 2018 by releasing a special-edition coin set fashioned in the likeness of 17th-century playing cards.

      "bodyText": "The Cuban government has accused Brazil\u2019s far-right president of depriving Brazilian smokers of \u201cthe best Habano cigars in the world\u201d as part of a \u201cservile and perverse\u201d US-backed campaign against the communist-run island. Jair Bolsonaro has made attacking authoritarian regimes a mainstay of his discourse since taking office in January \u2013 providing they are leftwing. And some suspect that hostility lay behind recent moves by Anvisa, Brazil\u2019s answer to the Food Standards Agency, to ban the sale of Cuba\u2019s flagship Cohiba cigars. The decision was reportedly based on the discovery that one batch of imported Cohibas contained an excess of sobric acid. Cuba\u2019s foreign trade minister, Rodrigo Malmierca D\u00edaz, slammed the ban on Tuesday. \u201cA ridiculous pretext,\u201d he tweeted, adding: \u201cPerhaps [Bolsonaro\u2019s government] was given some instruction from Washington to contribute to the blockade of Cuba.\u201d A journalist for Cuba\u2019s state-run newspaper, Granma, branded Brazil\u2019s move a crude, servile and perverse \u201cmanoeuvre \u2026 which was suspiciously in tune with United States government\u2019s policy to intensify its criminal economic, commercial and financial blockade\u201d of the Caribbean island. The journalist insisted only the finest tobacco leaves were used to make Cohiba cigars, which were created in 1966 for Cuba\u2019s then leader, Fidel Castro. There was also criticism of the move in Brazil, with one leftwing website claiming the \u201ctotally political and ideological\u201d ban was clearly linked to Bolsonaro\u2019s \u201cvulgar\u201d opposition to communism. In a statement to the Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper Anvisa said its analysis of cigars was routine and applied \u201cstrictly technical criteria\u201d. The director of the Brazilian importer whose Cohibas had fallen foul insisted his company handled only \u201c100% natural\u201d products. Relations between Havana and Bras\u00edlia have soured dramatically since Bolsonaro took power. Even before the far-right populist\u2019s inauguration, Havana announced it would recall thousands of Cuban doctors working in Brazil as part of a health program launched under its former leftist president Dilma Rousseff. In one interview Bolsonaro hinted he was considering closing Brazil\u2019s embassy in Havana, although he has yet to follow through. \u201cWhat business is there to do with Cuba?\u201d he asked. The president\u2019s son, Eduardo \u2013 who many regard as Brazil\u2019s de facto foreign minister \u2013 last year said he hoped Brazil could host an international tribunal \u201cto judge the crimes against humanity committed by the Cuban regime\u201d.",

But records show that in some cases dirty meat had already been allowed into the UK, forcing the authorities to seek a recall. Our investigation has established that significant quantities of the Brazilian dirty chicken detected at UK ports since April 2017 were supplied by two of the country\u2019s (and the world\u2019s) biggest meat companies, JBS and BRF, or their subsidiaries. An analysis of internal documents obtained from the FSA and international shipping records reveal how the companies between them shipped at least 400 tonnes of contaminated chicken to the UK over 20 months. The number of contaminated shipments sent by BRF fell significantly in 2018, possibly in part because a number of company plants have been blacklisted by the EU. Earlier this year however, BRF was forced to recall almost 500 tonnes of chicken products suspected of being contaminated with salmonella. Some JBS meat exported to the UK was found to harbour salmonella as recently as November 2018, according to records seen by the Guardian. JBS said that none of the revelations of Operation Weak Flesh \u201ccalled into question the quality standard of its products\u201d. It stressed that it follows all the standards and procedures laid down by the European Commission for its exports to the EU.

Aside from triggering a flood of scathing criticism from many observers, the plans have also led to some last minute logistical scrambling. It\u2019s easy to imagine how the jets will get there, but what about the tanks? That has seen Washingtonians engage in an intense bout of surveillance to spot any incoming tanks. Where would they come from and where exactly would they drive during the event? Would they even be able to get to the capital in the first place? Washington is now playing a game of \u201ctank watch\u201d and notching up some successful spottings. Two tanks and a number of support vehicles being carried on a train were identified Tuesday morning just outside the city. Elsewhere over the course of the day, other tanks, or perhaps the same ones (it\u2019s hard to tell at this point) were attempting to cross the Potomac River, not exactly a typical occurrence.

The discussion would have been of Gabriel Jesus at last scoring his first competitive goal for his country and of the effectiveness of his link-up with Roberto Firmino, who added the second on the break after incisive and determined work from the Manchester City forward.</p> <p>In the longer term it might have been asked where Neymar fits into this Brazil lineup and whether Brazil are a calmer, better balanced side without his travelling circus.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/03/lionel-messi-accuses-referee-brazil-bias-argentina-copa-america-defeat-football\">Lionel Messi accuses referee of Brazil bias after Copa Am\u00e9rica defeat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Argentina would have reflected on the Sergio Ag\u00fcero header that hit the bar and the Lionel Messi effort that came back off the post, on another tournament exit but one that, despite itself, was undercut by hope. This was by far their best performance under Lionel Scaloni, who will probably be replaced after the third-place play-off, and probably their best performance since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/30/argentina-paraguay-six-copa-america\" title=\"\">semi-final win over Paraguay in the 2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica</a>.</p> <p>While Ag\u00fcero and Messi showed only flashes of their best form, there was encouragement to be draw from the performances of some of the younger generation, most notably Lautaro Mart\u00ednez, Nicol\u00e1s Tagliafico and Leandro Paredes.</p> <p>But instead it is VAR that dominates. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/03/lionel-messi-accuses-referee-brazil-bias-argentina-copa-america-defeat-football\" title=\"\">\u201cThe pitch was tilted against us,\u201d</a> Messi said. \u201cThe people of Conmebol are going to have to do something. In this tournament they\u2019ve got tired of awarding bullshit, handballs, dumb-arse penalties and here they didn\u2019t go to look at VAR. There were two clear penalties that they didn\u2019t give us. For us, it was all cards and for them nothing. These are passages of play that are going to unsettle you and take you out of the game. The referee was not fair.\u201d</p> <p>The two specific incidents he referred to came in the final 20 minutes of the game. First, Ag\u00fcero, looking to run on to a Messi pass, tumbled over Dani Alves in the box. The ball was cleared and Jesus burst forward to lay on the second goal for Firmino. If that was a foul, then obviously the game has changed radically. But was it?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36a5cc560f99ab6de15833eaa2fba67e0adcab24\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36a5cc560f99ab6de15833eaa2fba67e0adcab24/0_125_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roberto Firmino\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Was there a foul in the buildup to Roberto Firmino\u2019s goal against Argentina?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nelson Antoine/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And this is where VAR has created another problem. At first glance it looked like nothing. Dani Alves, in so far as it is possible to tell from replays, was looking at Messi and Ag\u00fcero ran into him. In the moment the only Argentinian appealing was Scaloni. None of the players seemed bothered, although Ag\u00fcero was in a heap. Presumably it was checked but from how many angles? As the penalty awarded to England in the Women\u2019s World Cup semi-final demonstrated, what can seem innocuous from one angle can look very different from another.</p> <p>The second incident was rather more than slight contact. As Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi moved to meet a left-wing corner Arthur blocked his run with a thrust of the shoulder. Again, on first viewing, it did not seem anything out of the ordinary, the sort of thing that happens in penalty areas all the time. But the more angles that were seen the more it became apparent that Arthur, while essentially standing still, locked his shoulder, thrusting it towards Otamendi, ensuring that contact was heavy. Is that a foul?</p> <p>This is another outcome of VAR: no one, no matter how much football they have watched, can quite trust their eyes. The instinct players, referees and viewers have built up over years, the sense that something just looks like a foul, no longer applies. Worse, the law is different at different times and in different parts of the pitch. Some things \u2013 incidents in the box or leading to a goal \u2013 will be checked, creating strict liability; others will not. It used to be that a shove on the halfway line would bring a whistle but you could probably get away with it in the box; now the polarities have reversed and the slightest contact in the box is liable to bring sanction.</p> <p>In the past, although Messi and Scaloni might have moaned, it is doubtful if anybody beyond the most paranoid Argentina fan would have seen anything untoward in the outcome. But even if the headline in Clar\u00edn denouncing \u201cembarrassing errors\u201d seemed overblown, it is hard not to feel here that Messi at least had a point about process. What was checked, and how carefully?</p> <p>And were they penalties? Honestly, who knows any more?</p>",

      "bodyText": "There was a time before VAR. There may be a time after VAR. But this is the age of VAR and nothing can ever happen but that VAR is central to the discussion. The thought that VAR may end controversy has proved laughably misguided; if anything it has made the controversies worse because incidents that would have been seen as a referee making an understandable call in a difficult situation are perceived as being part of a wider failure of process, which is a small step from all-out conspiracy. Once upon a time, not so very long ago, Brazil\u2019s 2-0 win over Argentina in the semi-final of the Copa Am\u00e9rica would have been regarded as nothing more than a hard-fought and slightly fortuitous victory for the home side. The discussion would have been of Gabriel Jesus at last scoring his first competitive goal for his country and of the effectiveness of his link-up with Roberto Firmino, who added the second on the break after incisive and determined work from the Manchester City forward. In the longer term it might have been asked where Neymar fits into this Brazil lineup and whether Brazil are a calmer, better balanced side without his travelling circus. Argentina would have reflected on the Sergio Ag\u00fcero header that hit the bar and the Lionel Messi effort that came back off the post, on another tournament exit but one that, despite itself, was undercut by hope. This was by far their best performance under Lionel Scaloni, who will probably be replaced after the third-place play-off, and probably their best performance since the semi-final win over Paraguay in the 2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica. While Ag\u00fcero and Messi showed only flashes of their best form, there was encouragement to be draw from the performances of some of the younger generation, most notably Lautaro Mart\u00ednez, Nicol\u00e1s Tagliafico and Leandro Paredes. But instead it is VAR that dominates. \u201cThe pitch was tilted against us,\u201d Messi said. \u201cThe people of Conmebol are going to have to do something. In this tournament they\u2019ve got tired of awarding bullshit, handballs, dumb-arse penalties and here they didn\u2019t go to look at VAR. There were two clear penalties that they didn\u2019t give us. For us, it was all cards and for them nothing. These are passages of play that are going to unsettle you and take you out of the game. The referee was not fair.\u201d The two specific incidents he referred to came in the final 20 minutes of the game. First, Ag\u00fcero, looking to run on to a Messi pass, tumbled over Dani Alves in the box. The ball was cleared and Jesus burst forward to lay on the second goal for Firmino. If that was a foul, then obviously the game has changed radically. But was it? And this is where VAR has created another problem. At first glance it looked like nothing. Dani Alves, in so far as it is possible to tell from replays, was looking at Messi and Ag\u00fcero ran into him. In the moment the only Argentinian appealing was Scaloni. None of the players seemed bothered, although Ag\u00fcero was in a heap. Presumably it was checked but from how many angles? As the penalty awarded to England in the Women\u2019s World Cup semi-final demonstrated, what can seem innocuous from one angle can look very different from another. The second incident was rather more than slight contact. As Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi moved to meet a left-wing corner Arthur blocked his run with a thrust of the shoulder. Again, on first viewing, it did not seem anything out of the ordinary, the sort of thing that happens in penalty areas all the time. But the more angles that were seen the more it became apparent that Arthur, while essentially standing still, locked his shoulder, thrusting it towards Otamendi, ensuring that contact was heavy. Is that a foul? This is another outcome of VAR: no one, no matter how much football they have watched, can quite trust their eyes. The instinct players, referees and viewers have built up over years, the sense that something just looks like a foul, no longer applies. Worse, the law is different at different times and in different parts of the pitch. Some things \u2013 incidents in the box or leading to a goal \u2013 will be checked, creating strict liability; others will not. It used to be that a shove on the halfway line would bring a whistle but you could probably get away with it in the box; now the polarities have reversed and the slightest contact in the box is liable to bring sanction. In the past, although Messi and Scaloni might have moaned, it is doubtful if anybody beyond the most paranoid Argentina fan would have seen anything untoward in the outcome. But even if the headline in Clar\u00edn denouncing \u201cembarrassing errors\u201d seemed overblown, it is hard not to feel here that Messi at least had a point about process. What was checked, and how carefully? And were they penalties? Honestly, who knows any more?",

      "bodyText": "Time for a recap: Britain\u2019s economy appears to have suffered its first quarterly contraction in almost seven years, after a slump in company activity during June. Data firm Markit\u2019s composite PMI, which tracks the private sector, reports that activity shrank in June for the first time since 2016. The service sector stagnated, while manufacturing and construction both shrank sharply. Economists believe this means UK GDP contracted by at least 0.1% in April-June - ending a run of growth that dates back to 2012. If the economy continues to shrink in July-September, then Britain would be in a full-blown recession by the autumn [a recession = two quarters of negative growth]. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, warned that the economy could struggle in the current quarter. \u201cThe latest downturn has followed a gradual deterioration in demand over the past year as Brexit-related uncertainty has increasingly exacerbated the impact of a broader global economic slowdown. Risks also remain skewed to the downside as sentiment about the year ahead is worryingly subdued, suggesting the third quarter could see businesses continue to struggle.\u201d Duncan Brock, Group Director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, also fears economic turmoil ahead: With a dampened mood across the sector, if a General Election is also thrown into the pot of political turmoil in the coming months, then the service sector runs an even greater risk of following the manufacturing and construction sectors into cutbacks, cost-cutting and reduced workforces.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story: In other news: Eurozone government bond yields have fallen to record lows, after IMF managing director Christine Lagarde was named as the next head of the European central bank. Lagarde is expected to maintain loose monetary policy and low interest rates, and possibly press on with new stimulus measures. Some financial experts, though, are concerned that she doesn\u2019t have a central banking background....although her managerial and communication skills could be vital. Stock markets continue to rally, on hopes of lower interest rates across the world soon. Wall Street has hit a record high, Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is at an 11-month high, and eurozone equities are at their highest in two months. But Brexit fears are still rife - Sainsbury\u2019s have warned that a no-deal crisis could leave children without toys this Christmas, as Britain hasn\u2019t got enough warehouse space to stock up. The latest surveys of America\u2019s services sector confirms that its economy is slowing, as business confidence takes a knock.... Newsflash: The US stock market has hit a new all-time high at the start of trading in New York. The S&amp;P 500 has hit 2,980 points for the first time ever, up 7 points or 0.25%. Why are stocks so high, when there are worrying economic signs in the UK, the eurozone and the US? Because investors believe central bankers will cut interest rates soon to prop up economic growth. Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to cut the US trade deficit have suffered a blow. The US trade deficit rose to a five-month high in May as imbalances with China and Mexico widened, according to Commerce Department data. The gap between what America imports and exports rose by 8.4% year-on-year in May to $55.52bn. That includes a $30bn deficit with China, up 12.2% on a year ago, despite the new tariffs imposed by Trump\u2019s White House. April\u2019s deficit was also revised up, to $51.2bn. It\u2019s possible that the deficit was swelled by US companies rushing to buy products in case America and China\u2019s trade war worsened (instead, they agreed to restart talks). Ouch! Disappointing jobs data from America suggests the UK isn\u2019t the only economy slowing. Just 102,000 new private sector jobs were created by US firms in June, according to data from payroll operator ADP. Economists had expected 140,000 new hires, so this is a bit of a blow. It may suggest that the wider US employment report, due on Friday, will also disappoint. Economists had expected the Non-Farm Payroll to increase by 163,000, after May\u2019s very weak 75,000. Perhaps they should revise those forecasts down a little.... A recession is typically defined as two quarters of negative growth in a row. If Markit are right, then the UK is halfway there, for the first time since the financial crisis a decade ago. Associated Press\u2019s economics expert Pan Pylas also fears Britain is close to falling into recession, judging by this morning\u2019s PMI data. Britain\u2019s economy showed alarming signs of a sharp slowdown, possibly even into recession, as uncertainty over Brexit combines with a less benign global backdrop, according to a closely watched survey of business activity in the U.K. released Wednesday. The survey, from financial information firm IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, showed that the economy contracted in June at its steepest rate since the immediate aftermath of the country\u2019s vote three years ago to leave the European Union. The survey also found the second-steepest fall in output since the height of the global financial crisis a decade ago. The survey\u2019s main \u201call-sector\u201d purchasing managers\u2019 index fell in June to 49.2 from 50.7 the previous month, suggesting that a contraction is underway. Though some of the retreat was clearly due to firms adjusting their stock levels after boosting them to record levels ahead of the original Brexit date of March 29, the survey does clearly highlight the scale of the pessimism among firms City traders are also concerned by the disappointing June PMIs. Could the Bank of England be forced to cut interest rates soon, to ward of a recession? A recession is bad enough, but a no-deal Brexit could also ruin Christmas! The boss of supermarket chain Sainsbury has warned that supplies of toys and electronics for Christmas could be hit if Britain crashed out of the EU on Halloween (the current deadline). Mike Coupe, the chief executive of the supermarket group, which also owns the UK\u2019s biggest toy retailer, Argos, said the current Brexit deadline of 31 October was \u201cnot far off the worst day possible\u201d for retailers, who would find it difficult to stockpile goods because warehouses would already be packed ready for Christmas. Here\u2019s the full story: Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell MP, says June\u2019s weak PMI reports show the government is botching the job of managing the economy. \u201cThis will spark yet more concern about the serious damage being caused by the Tory mismanagement of the economy and the threat of a disastrous no-deal Brexit.\u201d McDonnell\u2019s counterpart, Philip Hammond (for a bit longer, anyway), is hoping that some international investment will help: Fears that the UK economy is shrinking has knocked the pound lower. Sterling is down 0.3%, hitting $1.256 against the US dollar (a two-week low) and \u20ac1.113 against the euro. This chart from Bloomberg shows how the UK economy weakened sharply in the last few months: They add: The U.K. economy probably shrank for the first time since 2012 in the second quarter as Brexit uncertainty and fears for the global outlook took their toll on output in June, according to IHS Markit. The report comes a day after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned of damage to the global economy from rising protectionism, adding that the U.K. faces the additional threat of a no-deal Brexit on business investment. Here\u2019s my colleague Richard Partington on today\u2019s worrying UK data: The UK economy has suffered its first quarterly contraction in seven years, a closely watched survey suggests, amid growing fears over a no-deal Brexit. According to IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips), growth in the UK\u2019s dominant service sector, which accounts for four-fifths of the UK economy, came almost to a standstill last month. After activity in the manufacturing and construction sectors plunged into reverse last month, Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit, said the combined picture for Britain suggests economic growth probably contracted by 0.1% in the second quarter. The Bank of England has previously forecast zero growth for the second quarter but some economists expect GDP to have contracted. Growth raced ahead in the first quarter as the stockpiling rush in the run-up to the original 29 March deadline in the Brexit talks provided a shot in the arm for growth. The last time UK GDP went into reverse was in the final quarter of 2012.... Here\u2019s the full story. You can read the PMI survey yourself, online here. It\u2019s important to remember that the PMIs are not official government data -- they\u2019re calculated by IHS Markit based on interviews with purchasing managers. Their view on output, activity, orders and confidence are converted into a single number -- anything over 50 shows growth. So, according to Markit, here\u2019s what happened in June: Services: STALLED, with the PMI falling to 50.2, a four-month low. Manufacturing: SHRANK at the fastest pace in six years, with the PMI falling to 48 Construction: PLUNGED, with the PMI slumping to 43.1, the worst in a decade Overall private sector: SHRANK for the first time since summer 2016, with the PMI dropping to 49.2 Nick Kilbey, sales trader at Foenix Partners, says it paints a bleak picture: This morning\u2019s UK Services print completed the trifecta of woeful PMI figures for the week as it dropped below expectations at 50.2 vs 51.0. With Manufacturing PMI at 6-year lows, Construction PMI showing the steepest decline since the recession and BOE Governor Carney stating that the central bank is stepping up planning to overcome the potential impact of a no deal Brexit, the short-term future looks bleak for the UK. Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, says: Whoever ends up in No 10 will inherit an economy on the brink of contraction - and will have very limited margin for error in the next phase of the Brexit mess. Capital Economics also predict the UK shrank by 0.2% in the last quarter (they\u2019d previously expected a 0.1% contraction). Worryingly, they also fear the economy might not bounce back in the current quarter (July-September). A shift in activity to before the Brexit date [29th March] accounts for some of the weakness. But the fact the surveys have not picked up towards the end of the quarter, and global manufacturing is slowing, means the risk is that the economy fails to bounce back in Q3. Economist Howard Archer of EY Item Club fears that the UK shrank by 0.2% in the April-June quarter, having analysed today\u2019s PMI report. That would be the first quarterly contraction since 2012. He adds: An unwinding of the substantial stockpiling that occurred in the first quarter has clearly weighed on the UK economy in the second quarter, while it has also been hampered by extended Brexit uncertainties, an unsettled UK political situation and a challenging global economic environment. It also looks like consumers took a marked breather in the second quarter after spending at a fair pace in the first quarter. Quite.... If Markit\u2019s PMI report is accurate, Britain\u2019s next prime minister could inherit an economy half-way into recession. Here\u2019s Sky News\u2019s take: The authors of a respected economic survey are predicting the UK economy contracted in the second quarter of the year, raising fears of a potential recession ahead. According to an all-sector calculation, following the final IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) reading for June, the economy will have recorded negative growth of 0.1% between April and June. If such a performance was to be confirmed by official statistics - and then the economy failed to achieve growth in the current third quarter - it would leave the country in a technical recession ahead of its next Brexit deadline of Halloween. Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, fears that an autumn general election could drive the UK economy deeper into the mire. Here\u2019s his take on today\u2019s gloomy PMI report: \u201cService sector growth slid back last month reversing the small gains made in May, as the wave of political uncertainty and weakening economy continued to undermine confidence and the appetite for new orders. \u201cThis unwillingness to spend and invest by clients and consumers resulted in service companies upping the ante to compete for dwindling business opportunities. With the softest rise in prices charged to customers in three months, firms hesitated to increase their own prices for fear of losing ground in the marketplace. \u201cHowever, staff hiring at some companies went against the grain in this stagnating backdrop, as the rate of new job hires rose to its highest since August 2017. Service providers either built up their workforces in anticipation of a speedy political resolution, but others opted for the status quo fearful of a prolonged period of indecision. \u201cWith a dampened mood across the sector, if a General Election is also thrown into the pot of political turmoil in the coming months, then the sector runs an even greater risk of following the manufacturing and construction sectors into cutbacks, cost-cutting and reduced workforces.\u201d Many of the companies interviewed by Markit warned that they are running short of new work to keep their staff busy, as they complete existing contracts. Uncertainty over Brexit, and over who will replace Theresa May as prime minister, appears to be hurting the economy. Some companies fear that \u201cdomestic political uncertainty and subdued global economic conditions\u201d would continue to hold back corporate spending. Today\u2019s PMI survey is very worrying -- it suggests the UK economy has suffered its second-worst month since the financial crisis! NEWSFLASH: Britain\u2019s service sector slowed to near stagnation last month, as the wider private sector went into contraction. That\u2019s according to Markit\u2019s latest survey of UK purchasing managers, just released, which suggests the UK contracted slightly in the April-June quarter. Service providers reported that business activity was \u201cclose to stagnation in June\u201d, Markit says, with subdued client demand and a further reduction in \u201cwork-in-hand\u201d. This dragged the Services PMI, which tracks activity in the sector, down to just 50.1, from 51 in May. That\u2019s the lowest reading in three months, and virtually the 50.0 mark separating expansion from contraction. But there\u2019s worse news too. We learned earlier this week that manufacturing and construction both contracted month. Add in the services data, and it appears that the UK private sector shrank in June for the first time since 2016 - just after the EU referendum. This suggests that the uncertainty created by Brexit means the UK economy shrank by 0.1% in the last quarter -- putting it half-way into a full-blown recession! Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit, explains: \u201cThe near-stagnation of the services sector in June is one of the worst performances seen over the past decade and comes on the heels of steep declines in both manufacturing and construction. Collectively, the PMI surveys indicate that the economy has slipped into contraction for the first time since July 2016, suffering the second-steepest fall in output since the global financial crisis in April 2009. \u201cThe June reading rounds off a second quarter for which the surveys point to a 0.1% contraction of GDP. \u201cThe latest downturn has followed a gradual deterioration in demand over the past year as Brexit-related uncertainty has increasingly exacerbated the impact of a broader global economic slowdown. Risks also remain skewed to the downside as sentiment about the year ahead is worryingly subdued, suggesting the third quarter could see businesses continue to struggle. Data firm Markit has some good-ish news for Christine Lagarde -- the eurozone economy strengthened a little last month. Its Eurozone PMI composite Output Index has risen to 52.2, up from 51.8 in May. That\u2019s the highest reading since November 2018, signalling a pick-up in economic growth of the single currency area. But the recovery is being driven by the service sector, with manufacturing contracting. Several City economists and analysts are expressing concerns over Christine Lagarde\u2019s suitability to run the European Central Bank. The problem, as mentioned earlier, is her lack of experience at the sharp end of monetary policy. Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank reckons Philip Lane, the ECB\u2019s new chief economist, will have to do a lot of heavy lifting on economics. Reid told clients this morning: Given her relative inexperience with the ECB\u2019s (complicated) policy toolkit, there is a credibility risk, especially if and when things get more complicated economically, but markets will like the fact that she is a skilled and well connected political operator. The euro weakened a touch in response to the announcement, possibly reflecting the fact that a more hawkish individual was not chosen. It\u2019s probable that the intellectual economic legwork will now need to be carried solely by Chief Economist Lane, the only trained economist at the top of the new leadership team (recently-appointed Vice President de Guindos is, like Lagarde, a lawyer by training). That said, a lawyer could prove to be useful in the current environment, with the focus on the legal limits of ECB asset purchases, \u201cdisenfranchisement,\u201d the risk of debt restructurings, and the prohibition on monetary financing of governments. Erik Nielsen, chief economist at Italy\u2019s UniCredit, is also worried that Lagarde isn\u2019t trained in monetary policy. He told Bloomberg TV that Lagarde was a very intelligent person, and a great communicator, knows how to run big organisations: In normal times she\u2019d be fine, but it is not quite normal times now. She is not known to have engaged in a monetary policy discussion at G7 level. What if, or when, a downturn or a crisis comes, who does she rely on, without her own educational framework or experience at a central bank? Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services worries that the European Central Bank would be more \u2018politicized\u2019 under Christine Lagarde, rather than sticking strictly to monetary The appointment of Lagarde as ECB president will a) raise questions about politicization of the role, above all because b) in sharp contrast to Draghi, Lagarde does not have any background in economics or indeed monetary policy formulation. By extension this puts even greater emphasis on finding a successor for the excellent, always thoughtful and extraordinarily Benoit Coeure as director of operations - who would have been the ideal choice as Draghi\u2019s successor. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, points out that Lagarde does have other powerful skills, which she\u2019ll need to run the ECB. If confirmed \u2013 Lagarde would be the first ECB president ever without any experience in monetary policy. We think her management experience, including time as chairwoman of the IMF, would help her to lead the ECB as an institution. However, Lagarde will likely face many challenges along the way. While the IMF chief is considered a qualified candidate, that won\u2019t necessarily make Europe a more attractive place to invest over a tactical horizon.\u201d Oof! Italy\u2019s two-year bond yield has just dropped below zero, hitting -0.03% for the first time in 14 months. European stock markets are also rallying, matching the gains in the bond market, following Lagarde\u2019s nomination. The EU-wide Stoxx 600 index is up 0.4% at 390 points, its highest level since the start of May. Utility companies, healthcare firms and consumer goods makers are all up. Banks are lagging, though (as a Lagarde-led ECB isn\u2019t likely to help their profits by raising interest rates). Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has romped to a 10-month high, up 0.5% at 7,597, helped by the pound\u2019s weakness (down at $1.256 this morning). I imagine that bonds would be moving the other way if EU leaders had chosen Germany\u2019s Jens Weidmann as the new ECB president. Weidmann has been a persistent critic of Mario Draghi\u2019s money-printing policies, and thus more inclined to raise interest rates or resist further stimulus move. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, explains: Lagarde, who has built a solid experience fighting against the never-ending financial crisis, is expected to walk on Mario Draghi\u2019s dovish footprints to help the Euro area coping with the weakening global economy. Her nomination also means that Bundesbank\u2019s more hawkish Weidmann is left out, which is good news for Bund investors. Investors are expecting Christine Lagarde to take a similar approach to Mario Draghi, explains Frederik Ducrozet, a strategist at Pictet Wealth Management. He told Reuters: \u201cWe have to admit that we didn\u2019t see this coming, especially after she strongly denied being a candidate last year. She should provide continuity after Draghi, an important driving factor for markets. The ECB\u2019s reaction function is unlikely to change dramatically under Lagarde\u2019s presidency.\u201d Boom! Belgium\u2019s 10-year government bond yield has just plunged below zero for the first time ever. This comes as French and German bond yields also tumble deeper into negative territory, as the eurozone bond rally gathers pace. This suggests investors are optimistic that Christine Lagarde will take a dovish approach to running the ECB..... and are pessimistic about growth and inflation prospects. Here\u2019s Reuters take on this morning\u2019s market action: Government bond yields in much of the euro zone fell to fresh record lows on Wednesday, after European Union leaders agreed to name France\u2019s Christine Lagarde as the new head of the European Central Bank. Analysts expect Lagarde to continue current ECB chief Mario Draghi\u2019s dovish policy stance. If approved by the European parliament, Lagarde would succeed Draghi when his term expires at the end of October. Ten-year bond yields across the bloc fell 1-3 basis points in early trade. Germany\u2019s 10-year bond yield hit a new record low of minus 0.39%, while French 10-year bond yields hit a new low of minus 0.079%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. At the start of this week, you\u2019d have got decent odds on Christine Lagarde becoming the eurozone\u2019s top central banker. She certainly wasn\u2019t seen as a front-runner to become the next president of the European Central Bank -- Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann or Banque de France governor Fran\u00e7ois Villeroy de Galhau were more likely candidates. But when the dust finally cleared in Brussels yesterday, after days of tough negotiations between EU leaders, the head of the International Monetary Fund emerged as the chosen successor to Mario Draghi. Lagarde\u2019s nomination is part of a package that finally breaks male dominance of Europe\u2019s top institutions, with Germany\u2019s defence minister, Ursula von der Leyen nominated to head the European commission. Investors are reacting to Lagarde\u2019s nomination by piling into eurozone government bonds. They\u2019re calculating that the ECB will continue offering easy money and record low interest rates on Lagarde\u2019s watch, rather than tightening monetary policy soon. This is driving bond prices to fresh highs, forcing down the interest rate (or yield) even lower. Germany\u2019s 10-year bond, for example, is now trading at a yield of nearly minus 0.4%! That means investors are paying for the privilege of holding the debt until it matures. Lagarde will join the ECB at a crucial time (assuming MEPs approve her appointment). With growth weakening and inflation low, policymakers are already pondering what fresh stimulus measures are needed. Lagarde has already reacted, saying: \u201cI am honored to have been nominated for the Presidency of the European Central Bank. In light of this, and in consultation with the Ethics Committee of the IMF Executive Board, I have decided to temporarily relinquish my responsibilities as Managing Director of the IMF during the nomination period.\u201d But, there\u2019s already concern in the markets about Lagarde\u2019s appointment. Although she\u2019s run the IMF for several years, and also served as France\u2019s finance minister, she is undoubtedly not a central banker. Before entering politics she served as a lawyer, not an economist. Now, a legal background didn\u2019t stop America\u2019s Jerome Powell becoming head of the US Federal Reserve. Lagarde was also one of the key figures (for good or ill) through the eurozone crisis, so knows the challenges facing the ECB well. But will she provide the same leadership as Draghi, who famously saved the euro in 2012 with a ground-breaking stimulus programme, in the face of firm opposition from hawkish colleagues. Investors may question whether Lagarde can be trusted to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d when the next crisis comes..... Also coming up today New PMI surveys from Markit will show how the world\u2019s service sector companies fared last month. With manufacturing struggling, and global trade under pressure, services is doing a lot of heavy lifting for the global economy. Eurozone and US services firms will probably report slower growth, while the UK could be lacklustre. We also get a flurry of US data, ahead of tomorrow\u2019s 4th July celebrations. The agenda 9am BST: Eurozone services PMI for June (expected to rise to 53.4 from 52.9, showing faster growth) 9.30am BST: UK services PMI for June (expected to be unchanged at 51) 1.30pm BST: US trade balance for May (expected to widen to -$53.4bn, from -$50.8bn) 3pm BST: US services PMI for June (expected to drop to 56, from 56.9) 3pm BST: US factory orders for May (expected to fall by 0.5%, following an 0.8% drop in April)",

Trump filed for re-election on the day of his inauguration and has held dozens of campaign rallies since. Evidence of this permanent campaign is even more apparent online.</p> <p>The Trump campaign\u2019s spending on Facebook and Google advertisements leading up to the 2018 midterm elections dwarfed every other candidate besides Beto O\u2019Rourke \u2013 and Trump wasn\u2019t even on the ballot. In the first six months of 2019, Trump spent more than $11.1m on Facebook and Google ads alone, according to disclosures by the social media companies. For the corresponding six months of the most recent presidential race with an incumbent \u2013 January through June 2011 \u2013 Barack Obama spent just $850,000 on online advertising, according to Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings.</p> <p>A Trump campaign official, who insisted on speaking on background, offered only vague generalities about the current iteration of the digital campaign.

He had been either invisible or deliberately sober to the point of dullness, when his usual primary draw to Tory members is a self-created sense of optimism and fun. Much is also made of his supposed broad appeal to the electorate, evidenced by two terms as London mayor.</p>\n    <p>His bizarre claim to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/26/mesmerising-boris-johnsons-bizarre-model-buses-claim-raises-eyebrows\">make model cardboard buses</a> has raised eyebrows. In most political contests, Johnson\u2019s character \u2013 he has lost more than one job for lying, and has a complex and opaque personal life \u2013 would be a big issue, but among the Tory faithful he seemingly receives a free pass. It remains to be seen what impact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/22/neighbour-who-called-police-over-boris-johnson-row-goes-public\">late-night police visit</a> will have on his chances.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Brexit</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>He has promised to push for a new deal while insisting the UK will leave the EU come what may on 31 October, even if it involves no deal. While his hard Brexit supporters are adamant this is a cast-iron guarantee of leaving on that date, elsewhere Johnson has been somewhat less definitive. Asked about the date in a BBC TV debate, Johnson said only that it was 'eminently feasible', although he then went on to tell TalkRadio that the 31 October deadline was 'do or die'.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Taxation</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>His main pledge has been to raise the threshold for the 40% higher tax rate from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000, at a cost of almost \u00a310bn a year, which would help about 3 million higher earners, a demographic with a fairly sizeable crossover into Tory members. Johnson\u2019s camp insist it would be part of a wider \u2013 and so far unknown \u2013 package of tax changes.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Public spending</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>He has said relatively little, beyond promising a fairly small increase in schools funding, as well as talking about the need to roll out fast broadband across the country. Johnson has generally hinted he would loosen the purse strings, but given his prior fondness for big-ticket projects \u2013 London\u2019s cancelled garden bridge, the mooted 'Boris island' airport \u2013 perhaps expect more of a focus on infrastructure projects than services.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Climate and environment</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is unlikely to be a big issue for Conservative party members, and Johnson has not said much on this beyond confirming his general support for the new government target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to a net zero by 2050.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Foreign policy</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Also unlikely to be a big issue among Tory members, beyond vague platitudes on 'global Britain', it could be a weak spot for Johnson given his poor performance as foreign secretary. He was seen as something of a joke by diplomats \u2013 both UK and foreign \u2013 and is likely to face more questioning over his gaffe about the jailed British-Iranian woman&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe\">Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe</a></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterwalker\"><b>Peter Walker</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Political correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Watson called on Hancock to \u201cstop any attempt to reverse the sugar tax\u201d, adding, \u201cit is your duty to do so\u201d.</p> \n<p>Hancock unexpectedly switched his support to Johnson\u2019s leadership campaign, after coming sixth in the first round of voting among Conservative MPs.</p> \n<p>The health secretary is regarded as being on the more moderate wing of the Tory party.

      "body": "<p>My father, Humphrey Fisher, who has died aged 85, was an academic and priest deeply committed to inclusion and diversity. He never achieved high office, but instead sought to support his students and to bridge religious and ethnic differences.</p> <p>Born in Dunedin, New Zealand, he was the son of Allan Fisher and his wife, Airini (nee Pope), both academics. His father\u2019s career as an economist took the family to Australia and Britain. Humphrey was evacuated to Canada during the second world war. </p> <p>He attended primary school in Oxford and Canada. After the war, when his father joined the International Monetary Fund, Humphrey went to Sidwell Friends Quaker school in Washington DC. He studied liberal arts at Deep Springs College, California, then went to Harvard, graduating in 1955. He took his PhD at St Antony\u2019s College, Oxford University, focusing on the Ahmadiyya Muslims in west Africa.</p> <p>In Oxford he met and married Helga Kricke, a nurse whose German family had been exiled from their home in Peru during the war. Their first son was born in Nigeria and their second in Jordan, where Humphrey managed a farm for Palestinian refugees.</p> <p>In 1962 he started work as a lecturer at the School of Oriental and African Studies (Soas), London University, specialising in Islamic history south of the Sahara, and remained there for a long academic career, retiring in 2001. Humphrey created the religious studies programme at Soas, breaking down barriers between religious specialisms, and provided generous support to diverse students, including those wanting to explore their heritage. </p> <p>Humphrey was way ahead of his time for the 1960s and 70s in the way he chose to bring up his children. He would work several days a week from our home in Hampton, south-west London, to be there for his four sons. He never missed a concert, sports match or other event. When I started school, he managed his commute so that he could wave as I crossed the railway bridge on my way to school.</p> <p>In 1986 he moved to Newchurch in the Welsh borders. Long an active Quaker, he became ordained in the (Anglican) Church in Wales by training at a Catholic college, and preached at Presbyterian churches. He also continued his academic career, teaching Islam and its history and drawing together teachers and students of different religions. </p> <p>At St Mary\u2019s church, Newchurch, he provided tea-making facilities for walkers on Offa\u2019s Dyke path, drawing thousands of visitors into the church. He also instituted the annual Kilvert pilgrimage, now in its 20th year, linking the four rural churches he served as a non-stipendiary minister.</p> <p>Helga died in 2012. Humphrey is survived by their sons, Clem, Duncan, Crispin and me, 10 grandchildren and a great-grandchild. </p>",

      "bodyText": "My father, Humphrey Fisher, who has died aged 85, was an academic and priest deeply committed to inclusion and diversity. He never achieved high office, but instead sought to support his students and to bridge religious and ethnic differences. Born in Dunedin, New Zealand, he was the son of Allan Fisher and his wife, Airini (nee Pope), both academics. His father\u2019s career as an economist took the family to Australia and Britain. Humphrey was evacuated to Canada during the second world war. He attended primary school in Oxford and Canada. After the war, when his father joined the International Monetary Fund, Humphrey went to Sidwell Friends Quaker school in Washington DC. He studied liberal arts at Deep Springs College, California, then went to Harvard, graduating in 1955. He took his PhD at St Antony\u2019s College, Oxford University, focusing on the Ahmadiyya Muslims in west Africa. In Oxford he met and married Helga Kricke, a nurse whose German family had been exiled from their home in Peru during the war. Their first son was born in Nigeria and their second in Jordan, where Humphrey managed a farm for Palestinian refugees. In 1962 he started work as a lecturer at the School of Oriental and African Studies (Soas), London University, specialising in Islamic history south of the Sahara, and remained there for a long academic career, retiring in 2001. Humphrey created the religious studies programme at Soas, breaking down barriers between religious specialisms, and provided generous support to diverse students, including those wanting to explore their heritage. Humphrey was way ahead of his time for the 1960s and 70s in the way he chose to bring up his children. He would work several days a week from our home in Hampton, south-west London, to be there for his four sons. He never missed a concert, sports match or other event. When I started school, he managed his commute so that he could wave as I crossed the railway bridge on my way to school. In 1986 he moved to Newchurch in the Welsh borders. Long an active Quaker, he became ordained in the (Anglican) Church in Wales by training at a Catholic college, and preached at Presbyterian churches. He also continued his academic career, teaching Islam and its history and drawing together teachers and students of different religions. At St Mary\u2019s church, Newchurch, he provided tea-making facilities for walkers on Offa\u2019s Dyke path, drawing thousands of visitors into the church. He also instituted the annual Kilvert pilgrimage, now in its 20th year, linking the four rural churches he served as a non-stipendiary minister. Helga died in 2012. Humphrey is survived by their sons, Clem, Duncan, Crispin and me, 10 grandchildren and a great-grandchild.",

      "bodyText": "Labour has said a pregnant MP who reportedly faced a motion of no confidence in her constituency is not under threat, saying no such motion will take place. Ellie Reeves, the MP for Lewisham West and Penge since 2017, faced the threat of a no-confidence vote after signing a statement criticising her party\u2019s decision to readmit Chris Williamson. But it is understood that the person in Reeves\u2019s 2,000-strong constituency Labour party who proposed the idea has since confirmed they would not be formally moving such a motion. The no-confidence attempt prompted fellow MPs to condemn the move, with the shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, calling it \u201cludicrous\u201d. The party subsequently said it would not take place. A Labour source said: \u201cIt would be wrong to bring a motion of no confidence against a pregnant MP who will soon be on maternity leave. \u201cNo motion has been formally moved or tabled. And in any case, motions of no confidence have no formal standing and do not result in trigger ballots. Any MP who is on parental leave will not undergo reselection processes until they return from leave.\u201d Williamson was readmitted last Wednesday by a national executive panel that ruled he should only be reprimanded, although on Friday he was suspended again following a backlash that included the letter signed by Reeves and the deputy leader, Tom Watson, among others. According to the website PoliticsHome, the email suggesting the idea said: \u201cI would like to put forward a motion of no confidence in Ellie Reeves our MP for signing Tom Watson MP letter regarding Chris Williamson MP at our next meeting and also start the new trigger process to deselect our MP which you should have received from Jennie Formby.\u201d Reeves, who is 22 weeks pregnant, thanked Labour members for their support on social media after the news broke.

At an earlier hearing, the prominent French lawyer Olivier Morice, who represented the playwright before a civil court in the French city of Caen, described the work as a \u201csatirical fable on capitalism\u201d and told Barclay\u2019s lawyer: \u201cYou don\u2019t have the courage to plead censorship but you are asking for the play to be banned.\u201d Barclay, who alongside his twin brother, Sir Frederick, is one of the richest men in Britain with a shared fortune of \u00a38bn, claimed the production portrayed him unfairly.

They have clashed with local politicians and other residents in the tiny crown dependency over the decades, while helping to abolish one of the world\u2019s last remaining feudal systems. After successfully bringing democracy to the islands they subsequently closed down their businesses when voters failed to back their preferred candidates. Clermont-Tonnerre acknowledged that his play, which does not mention the Barclays by name but features two wealthy Britons who live in a castle on Brecqhou, was partly inspired by the lives of the brothers. But he defended his right to freedom of expression and said the play had been commissioned to explore the issues around the continued existence of medieval Norman law in the Channel Islands, while ruminating on the nature and future of capitalism. Barclay had asked for \u20ac100,000 (\u00a390,000) in damages for libel and violation of privacy and sought to have the work banned from being performed.

A plane spotter who had been following the flight on an aircraft tracking app saw the body fall and arrived at the scene in time to give this information to the police. A neighbour said she and her husband had heard a noise but thought at first it was collapsing scaffolding, before they learned what had happened and saw the man\u2019s remains. \u201cWe need to be grateful that no one on the ground was killed or hurt, but I think that the real focus now needs to be on why this man was so desperate that he felt that he had to do this,\u201d she said, adding that police had told her the body was frozen to the touch. Four years ago, the body of Carlito Vale from Mozambique was found on the roof of a west London office building below the Heathrow flight path. Another man was found unconscious in the undercarriage of the same British Airways plane, having survived freezing temperatures over the 8,000-mile (12,800km) flight from Johannesburg to London.

Stephen King\u2019s Dark Tower series is not unfilmable, but the 2017 take starring Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey might make you wish it was.

Is any book truly limited to the page? Perhaps unfilmable now simply means books often declared \u201cunreadable\u201d \u2013 so a lot of modernist novels that are heavy with lyricism, ambience or internal dialogue: James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/may/22/djuna-barnes-nightwood\">Djuna Barnes</a>. Or the obvious, impenetrable contenders with Matryoshka doll plots: Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace, Gravity\u2019s Rainbow \u2013 Pynchon again \u2013 and Dhalgren by Samuel Delany. Or books with footnotes: House of Leaves by Mark Z Danielewski, Pale Fire by Vladimir Nabokov. (Though the recent Amazon/BBC production of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/31/good-omens-review-sheen-and-tennant-fight-the-devil-with-dill-sauce\">Good Omens</a>, another Gaiman vehicle, proves it is possible to translate narrative meanderings on screen.)

This once got in the way of books such as Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s One Hundred Years of Solitude, which the author insisted for years must be told in Spanish and would not work as one feature film. As one of his sons said earlier this year, when announcing Netflix was making a Spanish-language serial: \u201cIn the current golden age of series, with the level of talented writing and directing, the cinematic quality of content, and the acceptance by worldwide audiences of programmes in foreign languages, the time could not be better.\u201d So has TV ended the age of the unfilmable book? Is any book truly limited to the page? Perhaps unfilmable now simply means books often declared \u201cunreadable\u201d \u2013 so a lot of modernist novels that are heavy with lyricism, ambience or internal dialogue: James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, Djuna Barnes. Or the obvious, impenetrable contenders with Matryoshka doll plots: Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace, Gravity\u2019s Rainbow \u2013 Pynchon again \u2013 and Dhalgren by Samuel Delany. Or books with footnotes: House of Leaves by Mark Z Danielewski, Pale Fire by Vladimir Nabokov. (Though the recent Amazon/BBC production of Good Omens, another Gaiman vehicle, proves it is possible to translate narrative meanderings on screen.) We\u2019ll have to wait and watch.",

We are encouraged to think of this most modern discipline as a sophisticated, perhaps even cutthroat world, where promotional and sales whizzes compete to be the best of the best in the battle to market various symphonies in sweat\u2011wicking polyester and cheap leather. In which case, why does the appearance of halfwitted naivety continue to dog these 360-degree thinkers? This week alone, Adidas and Arsenal have had to shut down a social media initiative after its promise to tweet pictures of its new kit with fan Twitter handles on it saw the official Adidas account posting pictures of Arsenal shirts with racist or deliberately offensive messages on the back. Then, on Tuesday, Nike were forced to withdraw a special edition Air Max Fourth of July shoe after their own brand ambassador Colin Kaepernick reportedly voiced concern to the company at their decision to emblazon it with the so-called Betsy Ross flag, a 13-star Revolutionary War version of the stars and stripes.

      "body": "<p>More than 90% of the top 20 performances in middle- and long-distance running are by black people of African heritage. Are they simply biologically better at it? That is precisely the kind of casual assumption that, as science writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/angela-saini\" title=\"\">Angela Saini</a> shows in <em>Superior</em>, has kept \u201cscientific racism\u201d alive for centuries. In fact, more than half of those performances are by Kenyans, coming mostly from eight small tribes. One theory is that, having lived at high altitude for millennia, they have adapted to make more efficient use of oxygen when running. But studies have found no physiological advantage, and it\u2019s possible that the answer is instead sociological. One thing is sure: having dark skin pigmentation is as irrelevant here as speaking a Kenyan language. The idea of \u201crace\u201d has nothing to contribute to the debate.</p> <p>If you\u2019re a typical Guardian reader, you might feel fine about, or flattered by, the notion that black people are better runners \u2013 it sounds positively antiracist, right? Yet this is the sort of reasoning that feeds racism: that there are meaningful biological distinctions between groups of humans (often on the basis of visible, literally superficial characteristics) that allow them to be categorised into distinct \u201craces\u201d, from which we can meaningfully predict traits.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The problem with scientists, Saini says, is that they too often assume they are above racism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The idea is so deeply ingrained that it is hard even to talk about race without seeming to accept its tenets. This doesn\u2019t simply reflect a long history of prejudice. It is also because \u201crace\u201d, defined in terms of skin colour or facial features, was and sometimes still is a rough-and-ready clue to culture: language, cuisine, perhaps religion and shared moral values. It fits with the way we navigate a complicated world using \u201cgood enough\u201d rules of thumb. How, then, can it be as biologically meaningless as Saini says?</p> <p>The answer is subtle, and in this important book Saini \u2013 whose previous book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/06/inferior-how-science-got-women-wrong-angela-saini-review-and-the-new-research-thats-rewriting-story\" title=\"\">Inferior</a></em> exploded myths around sex differences \u2013 does a superb job of explaining it. Genetics has played a central role in debunking race as a biological entity by showing that there are no clear cut genetic subgroups that map on to our conventional notions of race. Saini points out that she might have more genetic similarity to her white neighbour than with the woman downstairs who, like her parents, was born in India. But it\u2019s complicated, because there are also some identifiable genetic commonalities between populations. The point is that these occur at every scale and depend on what you\u2019re looking for, and don\u2019t privilege anything we can call \u201crace\u201d. Yet genetics has also given racists a new place to claim validation of what they want: proof of their superiority.</p> <p><em>Superior</em> reveals how hard it is even for the well intentioned to escape habitual assumptions. US medical researchers studying people\u2019s responses to drugs in 2003 routinely used racial groupings to categorise and analyse their subjects \u2013 and yet none could say quite how they defined race, retreating into embarrassed laughs. Even where \u201crace differences\u201d in health and medicine have been identified, such as the increased risk of high blood pressure for African Americans, the default assumption has been to see this as innately biological rather than cultural and socio-economic, so that the alternatives aren\u2019t carefully checked. The problem with scientists, Saini says, is that they too often assume they are above racism and so fail to engage with the history, politics and lived experience of race.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b85bc680a0c7224874d1356aaa55050314ced3c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b85bc680a0c7224874d1356aaa55050314ced3c0/0_124_2835_1701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018British nativists\u2019 were alarmed to be told that the 10,000-year-old Cheddar Man probably had dark skin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018British nativists\u2019 were alarmed to be told that the 10,000-year-old Cheddar Man probably had dark skin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: London's Natural History Museum/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s almost a catch-22. Surveys that force us to self-categorise \u2013 white British, African-Caribbean \u2013 in order to monitor potential race discrimination (which, of course, is real) end up imputing a false essentiality to race. Saini has to grapple with this, too, for example in discussing the 8,500-year-old bones found in Washington state called Kennewick Man, which DNA testing in 2015 showed to be related to contemporary Native Americans, as some had long claimed. \u201cHe was one of their own,\u201d Saini writes \u2013 while acknowledging how dubious it is to assert lines of ancestry this far back, as if \u201cit\u2019s not good enough to be who we are now, to be good human beings in the present\u201d.</p> <p>The explosion in genomic science plays a paradoxical role here. On the one hand, mail-order DNA analysis companies promote a genetic identity politics by encouraging us to find meaning in empty statements that we are, say, of a few per cent Scots-Irish or North African (or even Neanderthal) ancestry. On the other hand, genetic studies have helped show that human diversity was far greater in the past than was long thought \u2013 and that skin colour is a particularly poor guide to origins. Light skin did not evolve only after the migration of early humans out of Africa, and some \u201cBritish nativists\u201d were alarmed to be told that the 10,000-year-old Cheddar Man, whose bones were discovered in Somerset in 1903, probably had dark skin. Cheddar Man was most probably an ancestor of us all in one sense, even though his people were more or less wholly supplanted in Britain by lighter-skinned migrants from Anatolia.</p> <p>\u201cScientific\u201d interpretations of archaeological and anthropological (and now often genetic) discoveries have always been conditioned by assumptions that reflect a prevailing, often racist ethos. Cheddar Man was once reconstructed as white-skinned and rosy-cheeked, just as Kennewick Man went from being a Patrick Stewart lookalike to a shaggy version of Asian heartthrob Takeshi Kaneshiro. A few scientists insist on their total objectivity as they cling to a hypothesis in which the 13,000-year-old Clovis culture in the US descends from people living in Europe millennia earlier, who somehow crossed the partly frozen Atlantic \u2013 thereby claiming the continent back from Native Americans of Asian ancestry to become part of the \u201cmanifest destiny\u201d of \u201cEuropeans\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/18/race-science-on-the-rise-angela-saini\">Why race science is on the rise again</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sometimes this racial agenda is subconscious. But Saini uncovers a persistent community on the fringes of science, well funded by private benefactors (especially a foundation called the Pioneer Fund, initiated in 1937) and publishing serious-looking journals such as Mankind Quarterly with an openly racist philosophy. \u201cIt takes some mental acrobatics to be an intellectual racist in the light of the scientific information we have today,\u201d says Saini, \u201cbut those who want to do it, will.\u201d This movement has professors at universities who sit on editorial boards and attend conferences. It co-opts and inverts innocent-sounding terms like \u201chuman biodiversity\u201d so that they mean not the genetic variation in humankind that renders race otiose but rather the idea that there are distinct groupings that vary in innate traits such as average intelligence. These people will draw strength from the racism expressed by high-profile scientists such as Nobel laureate James Watson, the co-discoverer of the DNA double helix. They supply apparent intellectual heft to the \u201calt-right\u201d and to \u201crace realists\u201d (as scientific racists have rebranded themselves), and even if they remain marginal in serious science they have the money and influence to install themselves in governmental circles.</p> <p>And they must believe their time has come. While we should be outraged that the United States has a racist president, or that British politicians consort with neo-fascists and jokingly use self-designations <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/brexit-kkk-grand-wizards-boris-johnson-rees-mogg-chequers-erg-a8840496.html\" title=\"\">invoking the Ku Klux Klan</a>, we shouldn\u2019t be surprised.

On the one hand, mail-order DNA analysis companies promote a genetic identity politics by encouraging us to find meaning in empty statements that we are, say, of a few per cent Scots-Irish or North African (or even Neanderthal) ancestry. On the other hand, genetic studies have helped show that human diversity was far greater in the past than was long thought \u2013 and that skin colour is a particularly poor guide to origins. Light skin did not evolve only after the migration of early humans out of Africa, and some \u201cBritish nativists\u201d were alarmed to be told that the 10,000-year-old Cheddar Man, whose bones were discovered in Somerset in 1903, probably had dark skin. Cheddar Man was most probably an ancestor of us all in one sense, even though his people were more or less wholly supplanted in Britain by lighter-skinned migrants from Anatolia. \u201cScientific\u201d interpretations of archaeological and anthropological (and now often genetic) discoveries have always been conditioned by assumptions that reflect a prevailing, often racist ethos. Cheddar Man was once reconstructed as white-skinned and rosy-cheeked, just as Kennewick Man went from being a Patrick Stewart lookalike to a shaggy version of Asian heartthrob Takeshi Kaneshiro. A few scientists insist on their total objectivity as they cling to a hypothesis in which the 13,000-year-old Clovis culture in the US descends from people living in Europe millennia earlier, who somehow crossed the partly frozen Atlantic \u2013 thereby claiming the continent back from Native Americans of Asian ancestry to become part of the \u201cmanifest destiny\u201d of \u201cEuropeans\u201d. Sometimes this racial agenda is subconscious. But Saini uncovers a persistent community on the fringes of science, well funded by private benefactors (especially a foundation called the Pioneer Fund, initiated in 1937) and publishing serious-looking journals such as Mankind Quarterly with an openly racist philosophy. \u201cIt takes some mental acrobatics to be an intellectual racist in the light of the scientific information we have today,\u201d says Saini, \u201cbut those who want to do it, will.\u201d This movement has professors at universities who sit on editorial boards and attend conferences. It co-opts and inverts innocent-sounding terms like \u201chuman biodiversity\u201d so that they mean not the genetic variation in humankind that renders race otiose but rather the idea that there are distinct groupings that vary in innate traits such as average intelligence. These people will draw strength from the racism expressed by high-profile scientists such as Nobel laureate James Watson, the co-discoverer of the DNA double helix. They supply apparent intellectual heft to the \u201calt-right\u201d and to \u201crace realists\u201d (as scientific racists have rebranded themselves), and even if they remain marginal in serious science they have the money and influence to install themselves in governmental circles. And they must believe their time has come. While we should be outraged that the United States has a racist president, or that British politicians consort with neo-fascists and jokingly use self-designations invoking the Ku Klux Klan, we shouldn\u2019t be surprised. Saini shows that science, far from killing off both biological race and racism, has a great deal still to do if it is to avoid remaining an enabler. \u2022 Superior: The Return of Race Science by Angela Saini is published by 4th Estate (RRP \u00a316.99) To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

      "bodyText": "Netflix has struck a deal to set up a permanent production base at Shepperton Studios, home to films from Alien to Mary Poppins Returns, as the company plans to spend more of its $13bn (\u00a310.3bn) annual production budget in the UK. The US streaming service made more than 40 productions in the UK last year, including The Crown, Sex Education and Outlaw King, and has been searching for a long lease for an exclusive hub to ensure the boom in demand for studio space doesn\u2019t hinder its plans to make TV shows and films without delays. The deal guarantees Netflix exclusive access to most of the facilities at Shepperton\u2019s west London studios, including its 14 sound stages, from October. Paul Golding, the chief executive of Shepperton\u2019s parent Pinewood, home to the James Bond and Star Wars franchises, said that the deal represented a huge boost to the UK\u2019s status as a major destination for film and TV production. \u201cNetflix\u2019s decision is a real vote of confidence in the UK film and TV industry,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is all about confidence in the UK as a location for top quality productions.\u201d Netflix has significantly increased its European production slate this year, with 221 projects, including 153 originals with a budget of well over $1bn. This is a more than 50% increase over 2018\u2019s slate. Previous reports suggested Netflix was lining up a long lease deal at Pinewood Studios. However, according to sources this was always unlikely because of the politics of rival Disney already having a long term deal in place at Pinewood until 2029. Disney has pulled all its content, which includes the Marvel superhero universe, the Star Wars films and Pixar\u2019s Toy Story franchise, from Netflix in the US before the launch of its streaming service, Disney+ later this year. Details of the deal with Shepperton are unclear but it is likely that Netflix has struck at least a 10-year agreement, the same length of time Disney is thought to have at Pinewood. Earlier this year, Pinewood gained planning permission for a \u00a3500m expansion of Shepperton, which will make it the second-largest studio in the world. The existing Shepperton site will be expanded five-fold and will include 16 new sound stages due to open from 2021. Golding said that Netflix\u2019s takeover of all of Shepperton\u2019s current stage capacity would not mean the US giant would be muscling out other British and foreign companies that currently use the site. He said that the 165,000 square feet of stage space Netflix is taking would be offset by the opening of six new sound stages, about 130,000 square feet, at Pinewood starting in October. \u201cIt is not like Netflix is going to be dislodging all our other customers,\u201d said Golding. \u201cThe new sound stages will enable us to have sufficient space for all our customers.

It\u2019s a leather overcoat with buttons, styled as a dress, and a belt to cinch in my waist. It was winter, so I paired it with a black turtleneck for warmth.</p> <p>I don\u2019t usually wear head-to-toe Dior. I am a very relaxed person and I tend to wear things that are very chilled out, such as a big leather jacket. I don\u2019t really wear high heels. But wearing this, with the collar up, felt really sophisticated \u2013 it was like my alter ego. It made me feel like the person I want to be \u2013 I feel like that person has her act together.</p> <p>I had another outfit in mind for this event, but when I tried this one on, it looked so good and it fitted like a glove. My stylist was like: \u201cWow, this is a brand-new you!\u201d</p> <p>I also saw my ex at the opening \u2013 I didn\u2019t know he would be there but I felt like it was a good moment. This is the kind of outfit you want your ex to see you wearing.</p> <p>My sister Kate [Moss] doesn\u2019t influence my wardrobe; we don\u2019t live together and I am very lazy when it comes to dressing. When I wake up, it\u2019s always a rush to find underwear and a bra, and then I just chuck something on. Sometimes my outfits look awful. But my style has evolved so much \u2013 even from just five years ago. I had zero confidence and I used to be a lot less daring.</p> <p>I live in Chelsea and I think people are a bit more reserved here. My friend held an event recently and I wore black trousers with a bandeau top \u2013 it wasn\u2019t cropped, but you could see a bit of my midriff \u2013 with heels. We were at quite a posh restaurant and my friend said I looked great, but I could see older people staring. These days, I don\u2019t really care. I love what I wear and I think it looks great.</p> <p><em>The PacSun x Lottie Moss capsule collection is available from <a href=\"https://www.selfridges.com/GB/en/cat/?freeText=lottie+moss&amp;srch=Y\" title=\"\">Selfridges</a>. </em></p>",

      "bodyText": "This is the look I wore to the opening of the Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams exhibition at the V&amp;A in London at the beginning of the year. It\u2019s a leather overcoat with buttons, styled as a dress, and a belt to cinch in my waist. It was winter, so I paired it with a black turtleneck for warmth. I don\u2019t usually wear head-to-toe Dior. I am a very relaxed person and I tend to wear things that are very chilled out, such as a big leather jacket. I don\u2019t really wear high heels. But wearing this, with the collar up, felt really sophisticated \u2013 it was like my alter ego. It made me feel like the person I want to be \u2013 I feel like that person has her act together. I had another outfit in mind for this event, but when I tried this one on, it looked so good and it fitted like a glove. My stylist was like: \u201cWow, this is a brand-new you!\u201d I also saw my ex at the opening \u2013 I didn\u2019t know he would be there but I felt like it was a good moment. This is the kind of outfit you want your ex to see you wearing. My sister Kate [Moss] doesn\u2019t influence my wardrobe; we don\u2019t live together and I am very lazy when it comes to dressing. When I wake up, it\u2019s always a rush to find underwear and a bra, and then I just chuck something on. Sometimes my outfits look awful. But my style has evolved so much \u2013 even from just five years ago. I had zero confidence and I used to be a lot less daring. I live in Chelsea and I think people are a bit more reserved here. My friend held an event recently and I wore black trousers with a bandeau top \u2013 it wasn\u2019t cropped, but you could see a bit of my midriff \u2013 with heels. We were at quite a posh restaurant and my friend said I looked great, but I could see older people staring. These days, I don\u2019t really care. I love what I wear and I think it looks great.

Von der Leyen needs to win support from a majority of members of the European parliament in order to take over the reins from Jean-Claude Juncker on 1 November. She travelled to Strasbourg on Wednesday to meet MEPs from her centre-right political family, the European People\u2019s party.

Brexit was one of a handful of questions put to the new commission president designate. Von der Leyen, a close ally of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, told MEPs the Irish backstop was a necessary part of the agreement with the UK. She faced more questions from central and eastern European MEPs, who complained they had been excluded from the EU package deal on top jobs which had awarded positions to nationals from Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Belgium. Von der Leyen will be relying on the votes of the European People\u2019s party to make up her majority when MEPs vote on her appointment later in July. The 60-year-old former gynaecologist, who studied at the London School of Economics, would be the first woman to lead the EU executive in its 62-year history. While she has won plaudits for her wide-ranging experience, her appointment has been heavily criticised by Socialist and Green MEPs. The election of the Socialists\u2019 candidate, the Italian MEP David-Maria Sassoli, as European parliament president for a two-and-a-half-year term, came as a consolation. He won a narrow majority, prevailing over a Czech Eurosceptic, the Greens and the radical left, after two rounds of voting. In his victory speech, Sassoli paid tribute to British MEPs and described Brexit as \u201cpainful\u201d.

Kov\u00e1cs also boasted of the defeat of Manfred Weber, the centre-right candidate to become European commission president, who was the first choice of the German chancellor. Socialist MEPs meeting in Strasbourg on Tuesday reacted with fury when reports emerged of the Von der Leyen compromise, largely because of the defeat for their candidate who has been the EU flag-bearer for the rule of law. \u201cIt is unacceptable that populist governments represented in the council rule out the best candidate only because he has stood up for the rule of law and for our shared European values,\u201d said the Socialist MEP leader, Iratxe Garc\u00eda.

The health secretary praised the sugar levy in a recent speech, saying it had \u201cremoved the equivalent of 90m kg of sugar since it was introduced in 2016, proving that population-wide measures work and are necessary, alongside promoting healthier behaviours and empowering individuals to make better choices.\u201d Johnson is not categorically ruling out extending the tax. He said he would first conduct a \u201ccomprehensive review\u201d into the effectiveness of such measures and would halt the rollout of any new \u201csin taxes\u201d until it had been completed. Health campaigners expressed disappointment. Shirley Cramer, the chief executive of the Royal Society for Public Health, said: \u201cOne of the successes of the last Conservative government was the introduction of the sugar levy for soft drinks. The evidence shows that the sugar levy has worked. Nearly half of the soft drinks market has reduced the sugar in their products to avoid charges. We should be building on the success of the sugar levy, not turning back the clock on the progress that has been made so far. A spokesperson for Hancock\u2019s department pointed to the success of the sugar levy and said: \u201cOur policies on obesity and public health have always been guided by evidence and will continue to be in the future.\u201d",

For decades, Ono was vilified by rubber-necking journalists and bitter Beatles fans alike, and her work \u2013 encompassing some of the most provocative and original feminist art of the era \u2013 was largely ignored. (Lennon once called her \u201cthe world\u2019s most famous unknown artist\u201d.) But at the turn of the millennium, the Japanese conceptualist finally began to be recognised as a major artist, with international retrospectives and even a reunion of the Plastic Ono Band, her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/jun/15/yoko-ono-plastic-band-review\">caterwauling avant-rock ensemble</a>, whose albums repelled 70s critics but inspired a generation of punks such as Sonic Youth.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I always wanted to do a bell piece of music, and I got a chance to do it, so I\u2019m doing it</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Yoko Ono</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The world\u2019s perception of her may have changed, but today the famously dogged Ono is still banging the same drum \u2013 or, more accurately, ringing the same bell.

The problem with peace, Ono suggests, is that it inevitably struggles to cut through our frantic, accelerated lives; it\u2019s our responsibility to make space for peace purposefully, rather than expecting it to come to us. Bells for Peace brings people together in a single moment to pause, reflect and recharge our imaginations.</p> \n<p>Ono\u2019s clipped communiques \u2013 little kernels of lateral thinking, as if she\u2019s entering each thought from a side door \u2013 have always been the engine of her creativity. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yokoono?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">In</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/yokoono?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">her hands</a>, Twitter becomes a proper artistic medium; her 4.8 million followers receive daily wisdom in under 240 characters: \u201cI am more interested in experiencing life rather than finding out its meaning,\u201d she muses one day; \u201cListen to the sound of the Earth turning.

Jeremy Deller was chosen to initiate this tradition, which he did by<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jun/28/manchester-international-festival-jeremy-deller-catwalk-what-is-the-city-but-the-people\"> inviting 150 Mancunians to walk a fashion runway above the city\u2019s bustling transport hub</a>, Piccadilly Gardens. Painting a portrait of Manchester through its people \u2013 dog walkers, doctors, a cab driver who offered free rides after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/may/21/pupils-imagined-talk-with-manchester-arena-bomber-wins-award\">the terror attack at Manchester Arena in 2017</a> \u2013 the commission had \u201can extraordinary response,\u201d says McGrath.</p> \n<p>Ono was the obvious choice to continue this new tradition. After gauging her interest, McGrath soon found himself in Ono\u2019s living room in the Dakota Building, the New York block where she has lived since 1973. \u201cWhat we really wanted was what she became excited about,\u201d says McGrath, \u201cwhich was a mass participatory artwork. One of the things she always said is that peace isn\u2019t absence of war \u2013 peace is a thing that you have to do, together, and the ringing of bells together is her expression of that.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>One of the things she always said is that peace isn't absence of war \u2013 peace is a thing that you have to do, together</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>John McGrath</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Ono breezes through the rest of my questions. What\u2019s the best thing about being in your 80s? \u201cBy then you will know how to live.\u201d When was the last time a work of art affected you deeply? \u201cI feel that a work of art, depending on how you see it, affects us all the time. The beautiful sky, like today.\u201d What can I do to boost my imagination? \u201cYou are already improving.\u201d Glad to hear it.</p> \n<p>Working with an artist who makes a virtue of deflection comes with its challenges. \u201cYou ask a question and the answer you get isn\u2019t necessarily the practical, head-on answer,\u201d says McGrath with a chuckle. \u201cSometimes the answers require some thought and interpretation.

      "bodyText": "John Lennon once called Imagine \u201can ad campaign for peace\u201d. Sadly, it wasn\u2019t a very successful campaign; war has remained incomprehensibly popular even as the song itself has become ubiquitous \u2013 it topped a 1999 poll to find Britain\u2019s favourite song lyric. Written as the Vietnam war raged, Imagine now seems clearly influenced by Lennon\u2019s wife, Yoko Ono, and her 1964 book Grapefruit, a collection of instructions that stand in for physical artworks. \u201cImagine the clouds dripping. Dig a hole in your garden to put them in,\u201d run the familiar-sounding instructions for Cloud Piece. Ono wouldn\u2019t be given a songwriting credit on Imagine until 2017, but by 1971 she had already become the most significant artistic influence on Lennon since Chuck Berry. For decades, Ono was vilified by rubber-necking journalists and bitter Beatles fans alike, and her work \u2013 encompassing some of the most provocative and original feminist art of the era \u2013 was largely ignored. (Lennon once called her \u201cthe world\u2019s most famous unknown artist\u201d.) But at the turn of the millennium, the Japanese conceptualist finally began to be recognised as a major artist, with international retrospectives and even a reunion of the Plastic Ono Band, her caterwauling avant-rock ensemble, whose albums repelled 70s critics but inspired a generation of punks such as Sonic Youth. The world\u2019s perception of her may have changed, but today the famously dogged Ono is still banging the same drum \u2013 or, more accurately, ringing the same bell. In her latest artwork, she is enlisting thousands of ordinary folk to ring in this year\u2019s Manchester international festival with Bells for Peace, a mass participatory artwork that returns to her most enduring theme. At 6pm on Thursday, Manchester\u2019s Cathedral Gardens will resound with the peals of 4,000 ceramic bells, handmade and engraved for the occasion, along with the mightier clangs of a huge Buddhist bell and antique church bells. Those will be harmoniously tuned, but the festival is also encouraging the public to bring along their own bells: the result, you imagine, will be a kind of joyful discord. (As well as being free and open to the public, the event will also be livestreamed through the MIF website.) \u201cI always wanted to do a bell piece [of] music, and I got a chance to do it, so I\u2019m doing it,\u201d emails Ono (now 86, she has retired from face-to-face interviews). \u201cWhenever we win the war, we bring out our own bell to say, we won!\u201d Invoking the bells that rang out to declare the armistice in 1918, Ono interprets the resonant peal of bells as \u201ca peaceful sound, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s desperately needed now\u201d. But why does peace still need an ad campaign? What returns is a rather baffling one-liner: \u201cBecause [people] like to run, jump, and skip, and it\u2019s not the so-called interesting thing to do.\u201d Spend some time turning that sentence over in your head, like a Zen koan, and something instructional eventually falls out. The problem with peace, Ono suggests, is that it inevitably struggles to cut through our frantic, accelerated lives; it\u2019s our responsibility to make space for peace purposefully, rather than expecting it to come to us. Bells for Peace brings people together in a single moment to pause, reflect and recharge our imaginations. Ono\u2019s clipped communiques \u2013 little kernels of lateral thinking, as if she\u2019s entering each thought from a side door \u2013 have always been the engine of her creativity. Inher hands, Twitter becomes a proper artistic medium; her 4.8 million followers receive daily wisdom in under 240 characters: \u201cI am more interested in experiencing life rather than finding out its meaning,\u201d she muses one day; \u201cListen to the sound of the Earth turning. We are all turning together. Isn\u2019t it nice?\u201d It\u2019s all part of the continuing performance piece that is Yoko Ono, a woman who was turning her life into art long before a stray Beatle wandered into her London gallery show. Two years before Lennon wrote Imagine, the newly married couple spent their honeymoon in a hotel bed, surrounded by cameras. Their Bed-Ins for Peace merged Lennon\u2019s rock\u2019n\u2019roll populism with Ono\u2019s avant garde audacity, honed through her radical performances such as Cut Piece, in which she sat calmly as her audience cut off her clothes with scissors. Through the Bed-Ins, John and Yoko merged their life with art and laid the groundwork for the next generation of pop protest, from Red Wedge to Live Aid. When I quiz her on whether art can really bring about political change, there\u2019s still a hint of revolutionary thinking at work. \u201cArt is just part of the world,\u201d she deflects. \u201cWe have to rely on people, including yourself. Not government. Governments always have red tape. Our imaginations don\u2019t.\u201d As one of the most visible artists of her generation, Ono\u2019s influence is subtle but huge, running through several generations of younger artists, from the Guerrilla Girls\u2019 feminist critique of the art world, to Marina Abramovi\u0107\u2019s provocative performances, to the many artists, including Sam Taylor-Johnson, who have made music along with visual art. \u201cAs soon as you start becoming aware of the tradition of body art and conceptual art, you realise that a lot of it is rooted in her practice from many decades previously,\u201d says John McGrath, Manchester international festival\u2019s artistic director. At the core of it all is Ono\u2019s conception of art \u201cas something that the public completes \u2013 an invitation to the public to make the work with her\u201d. Two years ago, the festival made the decision to kick off with a public event \u2013 a commissioned work of art rather than fireworks or fancy ceremony. Jeremy Deller was chosen to initiate this tradition, which he did by inviting 150 Mancunians to walk a fashion runway above the city\u2019s bustling transport hub, Piccadilly Gardens. Painting a portrait of Manchester through its people \u2013 dog walkers, doctors, a cab driver who offered free rides after the terror attack at Manchester Arena in 2017 \u2013 the commission had \u201can extraordinary response,\u201d says McGrath. Ono was the obvious choice to continue this new tradition. After gauging her interest, McGrath soon found himself in Ono\u2019s living room in the Dakota Building, the New York block where she has lived since 1973. \u201cWhat we really wanted was what she became excited about,\u201d says McGrath, \u201cwhich was a mass participatory artwork. One of the things she always said is that peace isn\u2019t absence of war \u2013 peace is a thing that you have to do, together, and the ringing of bells together is her expression of that.\u201d Ono breezes through the rest of my questions. What\u2019s the best thing about being in your 80s? \u201cBy then you will know how to live.\u201d When was the last time a work of art affected you deeply? \u201cI feel that a work of art, depending on how you see it, affects us all the time. The beautiful sky, like today.\u201d What can I do to boost my imagination? \u201cYou are already improving.\u201d Glad to hear it. Working with an artist who makes a virtue of deflection comes with its challenges. \u201cYou ask a question and the answer you get isn\u2019t necessarily the practical, head-on answer,\u201d says McGrath with a chuckle. \u201cSometimes the answers require some thought and interpretation. But then she\u2019ll make these leaps \u2013 I sat there in one meeting with quite a few people and we were talking about the whole ethos of peace behind the work, and suddenly she says: \u2018Maybe we\u2019re going to end up with too much peace and we\u2019ll need some revolution instead!\u2019 So she also has that capacity to turn the thing on its head. There isn\u2019t Yoko Ono the work separate to Yoko Ono the person. How she exists in the world is very much an embodiment of the work that she makes.\u201d Whether she\u2019s issuing art instructions by tweet, inviting us to write down our wishes and hang them on a tree, or daring us to slice off her clothes, Ono\u2019s work is always an attempt to pull people towards each other, simultaneously cracking open our fears and desires.

      "body": "<p>Katherine Ryan is busily scrolling through a neighbourhood Facebook group when we meet. \u201cSomeone\u2019s dog attacked another dog today which was sad,\u201d she says, \u201cbut mostly people are just selling things.\u201d However, her days in north London might be numbered. \u201cI\u2019m just ready to be a bit country,\u201d she explains. Back in 2007, when she arrived in the UK, <a href=\"https://www.katherineryan.co.uk/\">Ryan</a> headed straight for Crouch End, where a gaggle of fellow Canadian comics had already settled down, and where she now spends her days mooching around in a velour Juicy Couture tracksuit she bought when Paris Hilton was at her peak.</p> <p>But the 35-year-old is now ready for a change. Her itchy feet are particularly understandable when you consider just how much has happened in the last 12 years. Previously a staff trainer for the Hooters restaurant chain in Canada, Ryan arrived in London with her then boyfriend, didn\u2019t think she\u2019d stay long and flitted between London and her tiny home town of Sarnia, Ontario. Her comedy career was in its infancy (\u201cI was definitely doing an impression of Sarah Silverman\u201d) but watching the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/28/sara-pascoe-comedian-q-and-a-interview\">Sara Pascoe</a> made her fall for London\u2019s standup scene, and put down roots in the city. She worked a 9 to 5 job, had a daughter, Violet \u2013 who is now 10 \u2013 and became a single mum when her relationship with Violet\u2019s father ended. \u201cI didn\u2019t even have a phone when she was born. A poor mum is a good mum,\u201d she deadpans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7cef834c41b582704c0a4f79f616b38d83730571\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7cef834c41b582704c0a4f79f616b38d83730571/506_262_6790_4075/1000.jpg\" alt=\"I talk about my daughter on stage, but that\u2019s becoming more and more fictional\u2019 \u2026 Ryan doing standup.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I talk about my daughter on stage, but that\u2019s becoming more and more fictional\u2019 \u2026 Ryan doing standup.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Idil Sukan/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, Ryan was also slowly ascending from open mic nights to panel shows such as <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/8-out-of-10-cats\">8 Out of 10 Cats</a> and on to her current position as Gen Y\u2019s answer to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/sep/04/joan-rivers-obituary-limelight\">Joan Rivers</a>. She\u2019s best known for caustic punchlines verging on the unsayable, and gigs on programmes like (the fairly mean-spirited) <a href=\"http://www.comedycentral.co.uk/your-face-or-mine\">Your Face Or Mine?</a>, where couples have to decide whether they\u2019re more attractive than one another. In a meta twist, she also presented the UK reboot of Rivers\u2019 gilded doc series <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/howd-you-get-so-rich\">How\u2019d You Get So Rich?</a> Ryan once quipped that the late comic \u201cgot exactly what she wanted from that final surgery \u2013 to stop ageing\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are all these jokes about me having plastic surgery but I haven\u2019t actually had any on my face</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ryan\u2019s own appearance is rarely out of the conversation. \u201cThere are all these jokes about me having plastic surgery but I haven\u2019t actually had any on my face,\u201d she explains. She has had fillers \u2013 though not for a year now. \u201cI think I got a little lost in the game, I had a bit too much. I was watching <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OO5wAECOyPQ\">The Fix</a> [the US panel show she appears on with Jimmy Carr]. I saw that my eyebrows were always up and thought, \u2018Ooh, yeah, definitely not doing that for a long time!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>We are snatching an hour at the Ace hotel in London amid Ryan\u2019s busy schedule, ostensibly to talk about her new Netflix special, <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80238020\">Glitter Room</a>, but Ryan is soon giving her opinion about everything from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/01/how-cardi-b-went-from-stripper-to-star\">Cardi B</a> (\u201cShe\u2019s just like, yeah I was a stripper \u2013 I love the fact that she\u2019s so open\u201d) to her tiny, \u201cunethical\u201d teacup dogs. She\u2019s got an animal rights event lined up straight after, and is a big fan of the kind of canines her mate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/22/danny-dyer-right-royal-family-from-tinpot-wideboy-to-tv-treasure\">Danny Dyer </a>describes as \u201cdogs that shiver and piss from their eyes\u201d.</p> <p>Ryan is warm, lightly cynical, and a bit of a magpie \u2013 she marvels at our waitress\u2019s luminescent makeup, and is herself dressed in a diamant\u00e9-studded denim jacket and black tutu with big, Lady Gaga-esque sunglasses by her side. She is unusually interested in the harried freelancers hunched over their laptops in the hotel lobby, a situation she can relate to; as well as the Netflix special \u2013 her second, following 2017\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80134968\">In Trouble</a> \u2013 she\u2019s currently writing a sitcom for the streaming service. The Duchess, a \u201cheightened version\u201d of her life, will, she says, offer something a bit different from the sadcoms that have dominated TV in recent years. \u201cMy character is a bit of a fish out of water \u2013 she\u2019s this brash, disruptive, North American mother who doesn\u2019t act like you would think a mother would act. And she\u2019s happy about being a mum! I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s a drag. I think you can still be taken seriously, you can still be fashionable, you can still have fun,\u201d she says, before pausing. \u201cDo you think we should sadden it up a bit?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7fd8bb5185903e0d1cdfc37ece8a148707134b1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fd8bb5185903e0d1cdfc37ece8a148707134b1e/0_0_4200_2803/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Katherine Ryan with Jimmy Carr, as co-hosts of Your Face or Mine?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katherine Ryan with Jimmy Carr, as co-hosts of Your Face or Mine?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steven Peskett/Comedy Central</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, even if the tears are few, there\u2019s a realism that\u2019s never far from the surface with Ryan\u2019s work. In both her sitcom and Glitter Room \u2013 previously seen on tour and in the West End \u2013 her hyperbolic, cutting gags often centre on motherhood, and single motherhood in particular. \u201cThe Glitter Room is Violet\u2019s bedroom,\u201d Ryan explains. The show is \u201cabout how proud I felt when I bought us our first property ever, a tiny flat. We decorated it to be really feminine, yet still in 2018 builders would notice that I was alone and be like, \u2018That\u2019s so sad, where\u2019s the man?\u2019 Or \u2018You don\u2019t want all those flowers \u2013 no man will want to live here.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The builders\u2019 lack of insight, which also extended to insisting that Ryan\u2019s male cat was definitely pregnant, provided the basis for her show, but it\u2019s also about some more universal themes. \u201cIt\u2019s about the ridiculousness of that and our shape of family, but it\u2019s chiefly about just celebrating whatever your family is, and [the fact] that you don\u2019t have to conform,\u201d she says.</p> <p>In her own experience, there\u2019s still a sense of judgment around single motherhood, even within showbusiness, where she says she\u2019s constantly asked, \u201cWho\u2019s watching your daughter?\u201d, or \u201cHow have you explained your dirty mouth to her?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"516239c4d6e3c5e8580b8873df810080e4ca8038\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/516239c4d6e3c5e8580b8873df810080e4ca8038/0_714_4859_7249/670.jpg\" alt=\"Katherine Ryan.

I\u2019ve seen shows where you can tell people have been laughing at a comedian\u2019s jokes for a while and they shouldn\u2019t have been. I think you always want to be able to show up and be treated really fairly \u2013 ruthlessly even \u2013 by an audience and that\u2019s the only way you\u2019re going to know if you\u2019re really funny or not\u201d.</p> <p>Ryan compares having been a single mum to being in the Brie Larson hostage film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/14/room-review-brie-larson-shines-in-a-dark-dungeon\">Room</a>, \u201cexcept at least in the film the mum had someone bringing her groceries\u201d. While she and Violet are supremely close, Ryan is also careful to give her daughter as much privacy as possible, and refrains from posting pictures of her online.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Kevin Hart was talking about his daughter getting her first period. And I was like, did she sign off on that?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI talk about my daughter on stage, but that\u2019s becoming more and more fictional,\u201d she explains. \u201cI love <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/kevin-hart\">Kevin Hart</a>, but he was talking about his daughter getting her first period [in his last special] and I was distracted. I was like, did that really happen? Did she sign off on that?\u201d Besides, she knows that in due course Violet might not want to be as closely linked with her as she is now. \u201cI\u2019m a very embarrassing figure. Right now she thinks I\u2019m cool but any minute, she\u2019s going to be disgusted by every word that comes out of my mouth, everything I do on telly, everything,\u201d she says. \u201cI want her to have the option to not be too humiliated by my work, even though it pays for her entire life.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, there is a chance Ryan may move home \u2013 and that wouldn\u2019t be the only change in her life right now. While filming the upcoming series of Who Do You Think You Are? back in Canada (\u201cI was just like, please do not let my ancestors have slaughtered the indigenous population, please!\u201d), she ran into her high school sweetheart, Bobby, whom she hadn\u2019t seen in 20 years. \u201cI genuinely have always loved him, always,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the nostalgia of your first love and being 16, but he walked in and I was like, wow. Then I just slept with him for an anecdote.

      "bodyText": "Katherine Ryan is busily scrolling through a neighbourhood Facebook group when we meet. \u201cSomeone\u2019s dog attacked another dog today which was sad,\u201d she says, \u201cbut mostly people are just selling things.\u201d However, her days in north London might be numbered. \u201cI\u2019m just ready to be a bit country,\u201d she explains. Back in 2007, when she arrived in the UK, Ryan headed straight for Crouch End, where a gaggle of fellow Canadian comics had already settled down, and where she now spends her days mooching around in a velour Juicy Couture tracksuit she bought when Paris Hilton was at her peak. But the 35-year-old is now ready for a change. Her itchy feet are particularly understandable when you consider just how much has happened in the last 12 years. Previously a staff trainer for the Hooters restaurant chain in Canada, Ryan arrived in London with her then boyfriend, didn\u2019t think she\u2019d stay long and flitted between London and her tiny home town of Sarnia, Ontario. Her comedy career was in its infancy (\u201cI was definitely doing an impression of Sarah Silverman\u201d) but watching the likes of Sara Pascoe made her fall for London\u2019s standup scene, and put down roots in the city. She worked a 9 to 5 job, had a daughter, Violet \u2013 who is now 10 \u2013 and became a single mum when her relationship with Violet\u2019s father ended. \u201cI didn\u2019t even have a phone when she was born. A poor mum is a good mum,\u201d she deadpans. However, Ryan was also slowly ascending from open mic nights to panel shows such as 8 Out of 10 Cats and on to her current position as Gen Y\u2019s answer to Joan Rivers. She\u2019s best known for caustic punchlines verging on the unsayable, and gigs on programmes like (the fairly mean-spirited) Your Face Or Mine?, where couples have to decide whether they\u2019re more attractive than one another. In a meta twist, she also presented the UK reboot of Rivers\u2019 gilded doc series How\u2019d You Get So Rich? Ryan once quipped that the late comic \u201cgot exactly what she wanted from that final surgery \u2013 to stop ageing\u201d. Ryan\u2019s own appearance is rarely out of the conversation. \u201cThere are all these jokes about me having plastic surgery but I haven\u2019t actually had any on my face,\u201d she explains. She has had fillers \u2013 though not for a year now. \u201cI think I got a little lost in the game, I had a bit too much. I was watching The Fix [the US panel show she appears on with Jimmy Carr]. I saw that my eyebrows were always up and thought, \u2018Ooh, yeah, definitely not doing that for a long time!\u2019\u201d We are snatching an hour at the Ace hotel in London amid Ryan\u2019s busy schedule, ostensibly to talk about her new Netflix special, Glitter Room, but Ryan is soon giving her opinion about everything from Cardi B (\u201cShe\u2019s just like, yeah I was a stripper \u2013 I love the fact that she\u2019s so open\u201d) to her tiny, \u201cunethical\u201d teacup dogs. She\u2019s got an animal rights event lined up straight after, and is a big fan of the kind of canines her mate Danny Dyer describes as \u201cdogs that shiver and piss from their eyes\u201d. Ryan is warm, lightly cynical, and a bit of a magpie \u2013 she marvels at our waitress\u2019s luminescent makeup, and is herself dressed in a diamant\u00e9-studded denim jacket and black tutu with big, Lady Gaga-esque sunglasses by her side. She is unusually interested in the harried freelancers hunched over their laptops in the hotel lobby, a situation she can relate to; as well as the Netflix special \u2013 her second, following 2017\u2019s In Trouble \u2013 she\u2019s currently writing a sitcom for the streaming service. The Duchess, a \u201cheightened version\u201d of her life, will, she says, offer something a bit different from the sadcoms that have dominated TV in recent years. \u201cMy character is a bit of a fish out of water \u2013 she\u2019s this brash, disruptive, North American mother who doesn\u2019t act like you would think a mother would act. And she\u2019s happy about being a mum! I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s a drag. I think you can still be taken seriously, you can still be fashionable, you can still have fun,\u201d she says, before pausing. \u201cDo you think we should sadden it up a bit?\u201d However, even if the tears are few, there\u2019s a realism that\u2019s never far from the surface with Ryan\u2019s work. In both her sitcom and Glitter Room \u2013 previously seen on tour and in the West End \u2013 her hyperbolic, cutting gags often centre on motherhood, and single motherhood in particular. \u201cThe Glitter Room is Violet\u2019s bedroom,\u201d Ryan explains. The show is \u201cabout how proud I felt when I bought us our first property ever, a tiny flat. We decorated it to be really feminine, yet still in 2018 builders would notice that I was alone and be like, \u2018That\u2019s so sad, where\u2019s the man?\u2019 Or \u2018You don\u2019t want all those flowers \u2013 no man will want to live here.\u2019\u201d The builders\u2019 lack of insight, which also extended to insisting that Ryan\u2019s male cat was definitely pregnant, provided the basis for her show, but it\u2019s also about some more universal themes. \u201cIt\u2019s about the ridiculousness of that and our shape of family, but it\u2019s chiefly about just celebrating whatever your family is, and [the fact] that you don\u2019t have to conform,\u201d she says. In her own experience, there\u2019s still a sense of judgment around single motherhood, even within showbusiness, where she says she\u2019s constantly asked, \u201cWho\u2019s watching your daughter?\u201d, or \u201cHow have you explained your dirty mouth to her?\u201d \u201cSingle dads are like sexy heroes,\u201d she says, a subject she expands on live. \u201cBut if you\u2019re a single mum there\u2019s still a stigma.\u201d The special was filmed in LA, where Ryan is less known than in the UK. \u201cIt really felt like proving myself, like you would do at an open mic or a comedy club,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think that\u2019s always the way it should be. I\u2019ve seen shows where you can tell people have been laughing at a comedian\u2019s jokes for a while and they shouldn\u2019t have been. I think you always want to be able to show up and be treated really fairly \u2013 ruthlessly even \u2013 by an audience and that\u2019s the only way you\u2019re going to know if you\u2019re really funny or not\u201d. Ryan compares having been a single mum to being in the Brie Larson hostage film Room, \u201cexcept at least in the film the mum had someone bringing her groceries\u201d. While she and Violet are supremely close, Ryan is also careful to give her daughter as much privacy as possible, and refrains from posting pictures of her online. \u201cI talk about my daughter on stage, but that\u2019s becoming more and more fictional,\u201d she explains. \u201cI love Kevin Hart, but he was talking about his daughter getting her first period [in his last special] and I was distracted. I was like, did that really happen? Did she sign off on that?\u201d Besides, she knows that in due course Violet might not want to be as closely linked with her as she is now. \u201cI\u2019m a very embarrassing figure. Right now she thinks I\u2019m cool but any minute, she\u2019s going to be disgusted by every word that comes out of my mouth, everything I do on telly, everything,\u201d she says. \u201cI want her to have the option to not be too humiliated by my work, even though it pays for her entire life.\u201d Meanwhile, there is a chance Ryan may move home \u2013 and that wouldn\u2019t be the only change in her life right now. While filming the upcoming series of Who Do You Think You Are? back in Canada (\u201cI was just like, please do not let my ancestors have slaughtered the indigenous population, please!\u201d), she ran into her high school sweetheart, Bobby, whom she hadn\u2019t seen in 20 years. \u201cI genuinely have always loved him, always,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the nostalgia of your first love and being 16, but he walked in and I was like, wow. Then I just slept with him for an anecdote. I thought, he\u2019ll go back to his friends and tell them and have a laugh, I\u2019ll tell my friends, they\u2019ll have a laugh, but no, I just really liked him.\u201d She pauses, before adding a pained \u201cUh oh!\u201d Bobby\u2019s still in Canada so they\u2019re taking things slowly. However, Ryan feels conflicted about the whole thing given her current projects. \u201cIt\u2019s annoying because I have the special coming out where I\u2019m going, right I\u2019m not going to have a boyfriend again until I\u2019m in my 60s. I also don\u2019t want to abandon people. I\u2019ve spent all this time talking to women who feel there is this culture that\u2019s like, \u2018She has all these cats and she says she doesn\u2019t want a boyfriend but she\u2019s lying, she\u2019s incomplete.\u2019 I hate that, because I felt very happy and very complete.\u201d In any case, she isn\u2019t about to start extolling the virtues of being coupled up. \u201cMen are like dolphins \u2013 best enjoyed on holiday,\u201d she quips in Glitter Room, and she\u2019s still keeping Bobby \u201cunder review\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m like, whatever happens, I don\u2019t want to be in love, I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship and I don\u2019t want to get married.\u201d Then she bursts out laughing and flashes a sardonic smile.

      "bodyText": "Two people have been arrested by counter-terrorism police after a Charity Commission investigation into a Sikh youth group. A 38-year-old man and a 49-year-old woman were detained on Wednesday at an address in Birmingham, West Midlands police said. The arrests resulted from an examination of evidence found during searches in September last year and are linked to a commission investigation into the Sikh Youth UK organisation. The force said the arrests were \u201cin connection with alleged fraud offences of donated charitable funds\u201d. The commission said the inquiry was examining whether donations had been properly administered by Sikh Youth UK, its trustees\u2019 conduct, its partnerships with other charities and its financial management. The profile of Sikh Youth UK has risen in recent years for campaigns that have included, as stated on its website, \u201craising awareness on social evils and supporting the victims of sexual grooming, substance abuse and domestic violence within the community\u201d. Other activities have included commemorating those who died during Operation Blue Star, India\u2019s bloody crackdown on Sikh separatists seeking independence, in 1984. Sikh Youth UK is not a registered charity but the independent regulator has jurisdiction over it because the funds being scrutinised in the investigation are charitable. Police raised concerns with the commission in October in relation to the group\u2019s receipts and use of donations. The commission then obtained copies of bank statements and analysis identified \u201ca number of regulatory concerns which warrant further investigation\u201d. A formal inquiry was opened on 15 November by the commission, which said it would also examine the organisation\u2019s status to determine whether it was a charity in law. A spokesperson said: \u201cThose running the organisation have not applied to register with the commission.\u201d West Midlands police said the two people arrested were being held at a station in the West Midlands.",

EM Parry\u2019s witty costume design tells a story in itself; Suni La\u2019s prim Prudencia in her purple felt hat and sensible jumper keeps her distance from tweedy scholars with wayward Open University haircuts before things turn ghoulish and four corbies appear in devilish red tops and black eyeliner. With a library of books cascading overhead and the bowels of hell lurking below, Parry\u2019s set keeps on surprising. The play feels on the long side for a comedy, but by giving proper weight to the serious story of Prudencia\u2019s run-in with David Fairs\u2019 devil (both suave and irritable, and seeming to dislike hell more than she does), Marsland draws us deep into its darker corners. Where La is as earnest and long-suffering as every fairytale heroine should be, Matthew McVarish brings a note of lovable enthusiasm to her otherwise boorish academic rival Colin Syme; they might be opposites in the head-versus-heart debate, but they make you believe opposites can attract. There is tremendous work from Alice Blundell and Eleanor House, jumping energetically between supporting characters and sweet renditions of folk songs, turning a dark winter\u2019s tale into an airy summer comedy. At the New Vic, Newcastle-under-Lyme, until 13 July.",

The website states that the team project began \u201cwith a casual bike ride in the desert of Bahrain between His Highness Sheikh Nasser and Vincenzo Nibali\u201d.<br><br>A brigadier-general in the Bahrain army and commander of the Royal Guard, Sheikh Nasser is a senior figure in the country\u2019s sports institutions, <a href=\"https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1076694/shaikh-nasser-steps-down-as-president-of-bahrain-olympic-committee\">chairing the Olympic committee until March this year</a>.

Today is the judgment day.\u201d<br><br>More than 150 professional sportspeople were reported to have been arrested, detained, tortured, imprisoned or excluded from their sports during the crackdown, for taking part in pro democracy demonstrations. Representatives of Sheikh Nasser say that he had no personal involvement in identifying any athletes nor in any suspensions or arrests.<br><br>\u201cSportswashing\u201d is a term coined by Amnesty to describe repressive regimes sanitising their countries\u2019 reputations by becoming associated with sport\u2019s appeal. The Tour de France and other cycling competitions offer all sponsors weeks of coverage with logos worn by great athletes in some of the world\u2019s most spectacular locations. <br><br>Representatives of the Bahrain-Merida team and Sheikh Nasser told the Guardian that the team is not associated with the country\u2019s human rights record, is not in breach of the UCI\u2019s ethics code nor engaged in sportswashing because it is completely distinct and separate from the government. They say that the team is funded by private sponsors, including Merida, the cycling manufacturer listed on the Taiwanese stock exchange, although <a href=\"http://teambahrainmerida.com/sponsors/\">several of the sponsors</a> \u2013 which include the Bahrain sovereign wealth fund <a href=\"http://www.mumtalakat.bh/\">Mumtalakat</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bapco.net/en-us/about-bapco/our-company\">the oil company Bapco</a> which itself says that it is wholly owned by the government \u2013 are described as \u201csemi-government companies\u201d. <br><br>A UCI spokesperson told the Guardian that it had been aware of the \u201callegations of human rights violations by the Bahrain regime ... prior to the initial registration of Bahrain-Merida as a UCI WorldTeam late 2016.\u201d </p> <p>The spokesperson did not explain what approach the UCI took to the human rights concerns, or why they were not a barrier to the team\u2019s registration. He added: \u201cFor the upcoming season, the independent licence commission will review the applicable criteria, including ethical, based on all available information pertaining to the team. The assessment ... concentrates on the team and its members.\u201d</p> <p>Sayed Alwadaei, the director of advocacy at Bird, described that as a \u201cvery disappointing\u201d response. \u201cWe raised similar concerns in 2016 and despite the severity of our concerns the UCI awarded Bahrain-Merida team the WorldTeam licence,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are asking the UCI now to be transparent about their due diligence and to disclose their assessment, as a rational assessment must account for a history of severe rights abuses.\u201d<br></p>",

Citing \u201ca large-scale campaign to clamp down on all forms of dissent\u201d, Amnesty cited media restrictions including the closure of Bahrain\u2019s only independent newspaper, al-Wasat, the targeting of journalists, and the reported torture of human rights defenders and political activists. The signatories draw attention in their letter to the fact that the Bahrain-Merida team was launched in 2017 by a son of the ruling king of Bahrain, Sheikh Nasser bin Hamad al-Khalifa, who is still described as the team\u2019s leader on its website. The website states that the team project began \u201cwith a casual bike ride in the desert of Bahrain between His Highness Sheikh Nasser and Vincenzo Nibali\u201d. A brigadier-general in the Bahrain army and commander of the Royal Guard, Sheikh Nasser is a senior figure in the country\u2019s sports institutions, chairing the Olympic committee until March this year. In 2011 he called publicly, on television, for the punishment of sportspeople who had taken part in demonstrations, saying: \u201cTo everyone that demands the fall of the regime, may a wall fall on their heads \u2026 whether he is an athlete, an activist or a politician ... Today is the judgment day.\u201d More than 150 professional sportspeople were reported to have been arrested, detained, tortured, imprisoned or excluded from their sports during the crackdown, for taking part in pro democracy demonstrations. Representatives of Sheikh Nasser say that he had no personal involvement in identifying any athletes nor in any suspensions or arrests. \u201cSportswashing\u201d is a term coined by Amnesty to describe repressive regimes sanitising their countries\u2019 reputations by becoming associated with sport\u2019s appeal. The Tour de France and other cycling competitions offer all sponsors weeks of coverage with logos worn by great athletes in some of the world\u2019s most spectacular locations. Representatives of the Bahrain-Merida team and Sheikh Nasser told the Guardian that the team is not associated with the country\u2019s human rights record, is not in breach of the UCI\u2019s ethics code nor engaged in sportswashing because it is completely distinct and separate from the government. They say that the team is funded by private sponsors, including Merida, the cycling manufacturer listed on the Taiwanese stock exchange, although several of the sponsors \u2013 which include the Bahrain sovereign wealth fund Mumtalakat and the oil company Bapco which itself says that it is wholly owned by the government \u2013 are described as \u201csemi-government companies\u201d. A UCI spokesperson told the Guardian that it had been aware of the \u201callegations of human rights violations by the Bahrain regime ... prior to the initial registration of Bahrain-Merida as a UCI WorldTeam late 2016.\u201d The spokesperson did not explain what approach the UCI took to the human rights concerns, or why they were not a barrier to the team\u2019s registration. He added: \u201cFor the upcoming season, the independent licence commission will review the applicable criteria, including ethical, based on all available information pertaining to the team. The assessment ... concentrates on the team and its members.\u201d Sayed Alwadaei, the director of advocacy at Bird, described that as a \u201cvery disappointing\u201d response. \u201cWe raised similar concerns in 2016 and despite the severity of our concerns the UCI awarded Bahrain-Merida team the WorldTeam licence,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are asking the UCI now to be transparent about their due diligence and to disclose their assessment, as a rational assessment must account for a history of severe rights abuses.\u201d",

Magid Magid, 30, who represents Yorkshire and the Humber for the Green party, said he was \u201cvisibly different\u201d but would not \u201ctry to fit in\u201d. The former lord mayor of Sheffield, who wore a baseball cap and T-shirt reading \u201cf**k fascism\u201d, claimed he had been asked to leave the parliament building during the opening day of the new legislature. Magid, who was elected as one of six MEPs for the Yorkshire and the Humber region in May, said he did not know the identity of the person who asked him to leave, although he believed the individual was an official. He said the person asked if he was lost and then suggested he leave. \u201cI know I\u2019m visibily [sic] different. I don\u2019t have the privilege to hide my identity. I\u2019m BLACK &amp; my name is Magid. I don\u2019t intend to try fit in. Get used to it,\u201d he tweeted. After receiving messages of support, Magid said: \u201cJust to clarity [sic], I obviously didn\u2019t leave. But to even be put in this position says a lot about what people think the stereotypical politician is meant to look like.\u201d Magid suggested his physical appearance made \u201cpeople feel uncomfortable\u201d. He added: \u201cMEPs don\u2019t reflect the people that they represent, Europe-wide and I know i\u2019m gonna stick out like a sore thumb.\u201d However, the European parliament said no member of staff was involved in the incident. \u201cWe investigated the matter immediately after our attention was brought to it and can safely say that no member of parliament staff was involved,\u201d a spokeswoman said. Magid was attending the opening of the new five-year session of the parliament. During a chaotic first day, Nigel Farage and his Brexit party MEPs turned their backs during the playing of the European anthem at a ceremony to mark the opening of the parliament. As a saxophone quartet and opera singer performed Beethoven\u2019s Ode to Joy in the Strasbourg chamber , the 29 Brexit party MEPs turned away from the group to face the back wall. Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat MEPs took their seats wearing yellow \u201cbollocks to Brexit\u201d T-shirts.",

      "body": "<p>Britain is a nation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/walking\">walkers</a>. Our landmass may be modest in size but is latticed with a generous 140,000 miles of public footpaths, bridleways and byways, and exploring them is one of our favourite pastimes.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t always so. Before the late 18th century most people walked only because they had to, or if they were on pilgrimage. Walking was the preserve of the horseless poor. With the rise of the Romantic movement came the idea of walking for pleasure, prompting such poets as Wordsworth to some of their finest words after traipsing the countryside on foot.</p> <p>So began the great British tradition of walking, and writing about it. Some authors have accomplished arduous hikes in far-flung lands; others have written just as engagingly about journeys much closer to home. Take Robert Louis Stevenson. Famously, he tramped with a donkey across the mountains of the C\u00e9vennes, though it is his gentler ramble across the Chiltern Hills that is the focus of my book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/country-of-larks-a-chiltern-journey-9781784770808.html\">The Country of Larks</a>.</p> <p>Non-fiction accounts such as Stevenson\u2019s make up the majority of books about walking in Britain, although fictional narratives have their place too \u2013 as do walks in less bucolic landscapes. Today, it seems no topography is too pedestrian to induce British authors to lace up their boots and take to the byways (and sometimes the highways) of our country. Here are my 10 favourites.</p> <p><strong>1. <a href=\"http://www.longwalking.com/longwalkers-john-hillaby/\">Journey Through Britain by John Hillaby</a><br></strong>Sometime before 1968, when the book was first published, explorer John Hillaby set off with a backpack to walk from Land\u2019s End to John O\u2019Groats, preparing for his 1,100-mile hike across Britain as rigorously as if he were traversing the Himalayas. Predating today\u2019s emphasis on self-discovery in travel writing, this classic may feel somewhat dated to modern readers. Its appeal lies in the warm and witty evocation of the British countryside and its people, as observed half a century ago.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"af29734e9923c47013e51580ddffad5954493bbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af29734e9923c47013e51580ddffad5954493bbf/0_0_3204_3485/919.jpg\" alt=\"Laurie Lee.\" width=\"919\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laurie Lee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/as-i-walked-out-one-midsummer-morning.html\">As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning by Laurie Lee</a><br></strong>One June morning in 1934 the young Lee set forth from the Cotswold village of Slad, where he\u2019d lived for most of his life, to walk to Spain. But before reaching Mediterranean shores, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/20/laurie-lee-centenary-birth-english-travel-writer-walking-robert-macfarlane\">Lee walked through southern England</a>, writing about his wanderings and encounters in characteristically elegiac prose. This was the era when tramps still roved the country lanes, cars were a rarity and Lee was still young and idealistic \u2013 before his initiation into the turmoil of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/29/national-museum-spanish-civil-war-barcelona\">Spanish civil war</a>.</p> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://www.wainwright.org.uk/coasttocoast.html\">A Coast to Coast Walk by Alfred Wainwright</a><br></strong>Ambulatory writers usually follow the old ways \u2013 whether trade routes like the Silk Road or pilgrimage trails such as the Camino de Santiago. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/alfred-wainwright\">Alfred Wainwright</a> preferred to plough his own furrow by creating an entirely new approach: a 182-mile walk linking St Bees Head in Cumbria with Robin Hood\u2019s Bay in Yorkshire. Complementing Wainwright\u2019s handwritten instructions and detailed drawings are touches of wit, homespun philosophy and lyricism, giving even the most sedentary reader an appreciation of England\u2019s dramatic northern landscapes.</p> <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/living-mountain.html\">The Living Mountain by Nan Shepherd</a><br></strong>Shepherd spent a lifetime exploring the Cairngorms on foot. This impressive mountain range attracts climbers from around the world, yet this is not a book about climbing. Dismissing macho <a href=\"https://www.visitscotland.com/see-do/active/walking/munro-bagging/beginners/\">Munro Bagging</a> as \u201csterile\u201d, Shepherd instead ventures out in all seasons and all weathers (mostly alone and sometimes barefoot) walking not on to the mountains, but \u201cinto\u201d them. It is the meditative rhythm of walking that unveils for her the essence of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/may/29/formation-dancing-with-space-blankets-wild-ways-climb-into-the-mountain\">the Cairngorms</a> \u2013 mountains that she comes to know as intimately as old friends.</p> <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/jun/11/the-rings-of-saturn-allusions-illusions-wg-sebald-w-g-\">The Rings of Saturn by WG Sebald</a><br></strong>When WG Sebald took a short walk in the Suffolk countryside he found himself among a burgeoning troupe of literary psychogeographers roaming Britain during the latter half of the 20th century. Modelled on Baudelaire\u2019s concept of the<em> fl\u00e2neur</em>, the physical journey is less important than the meandering intellectual expedition the narrator takes \u2013 in Sebald\u2019s case, one that embraces history, memoir literary criticism and biography.

Less conventionally, the quest undertaken in this book is a Sebaldian stroll around the 117 miles of the M25. Sinclair splendidly unearths an idiosyncratic and multilayered edgeland of industrial parks, shopping centres, housing estates and golf courses encircling the capital at the turn of the millennium.</p> <p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/unlikely-pilgrimage-of-harold-fry.html\">The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry by Rachel Joyce</a><br></strong>Joyce\u2019s novel sees her eponymous antihero set off on a trek across England to deliver a letter to a terminally ill former colleague. This Bunyanesque allegory about a retired brewery manager reflecting on his past while putting one inadequately shod foot in front of another takes on a tragicomic edge as attempts to catch up with him fail. At the heart of the narrative are Harold\u2019s words to his old friend: \u201cI will keep walking, and you must keep living.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"295989ba749f39c48c60004d647842dd36e6d52d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/295989ba749f39c48c60004d647842dd36e6d52d/0_0_5000_3432/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Enchanted \u2026 Dorset by night.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"686\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Enchanted \u2026 Dorset by night.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Stansfield/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>8. <a href=\"https://www.caughtbytheriver.net/2012/04/nightwalk-by-chris-yates/\">Nightwalk by Chris Yates</a><br></strong>Uncommonly, the walk described in this spellbinding narrative takes place over just a few short hours, and by moonlight. Setting out from his Dorset home one midsummer evening, Yates encounters the terrain and resident wildlife in its less familiar, nocturnal guise. Despite both the brevity of the walk and the book, as the sun rises you feel you have accompanied the author on a journey into an enchanted world, sharing the sounds, sights and smells that are only revealed after dusk.</p> <p><strong>9. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/january-man-535557.html\">The January Man by Christopher Somerville</a><br></strong>Inspired by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDCejNGfK7M\">Christy Moore\u2019s folk song of the same name</a>, Somerville embarks on a series of walks over a calendar year in search of his father.

It is also bleakly funny: \u201cI think I\u2019m drawn to temp work for the slight atmospheric changes,\u201d Millie writes. \u201cThe new offices and coworkers provide a nice illusion of variety.

Yet the generation that graduated into a recession has also been sold the lie that you have to \u201clove what you do\u201d. How to square that with the monotonous pointlessness of most office work? Butler paints it as a kind of spiritual death: \u201cBack at my desk I sit and slowly collect money that I can use to pay the rent on my apartment and on food so that I can continue to live and continue to come to this room and sit at this desk and slowly collect money.\u201d</p> <p>Her coping mechanisms are alcohol, back-to-back episodes of true-crime TV, deadpan humour and delicious hostility.

Steph Houghton\u2019s capacity to pop up with last-gasp interventions has papered over the cracks but goalline clearances are never an effective form of defence for long. The semi-final in Lyon was an odd game: USA have a seemingly conscious policy of playing in pulses and when they did, they were so palpably superior that it took an effort of will to remember they were never more than one goal ahead.

The name Libra comes from the basic Roman measurement of weight. The abbreviation lb for pound is derived from Libra, and the \u00a3 symbol originally comes from an ornate L in Libra.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is Facebook launching a cryptocurrency?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Facebook claims it wants to reach the 1.7 billion people around the world who do not have access to a bank account.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Who is in charge of Libra?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Facebook is likely to run into regulatory hurdles and antitrust concerns. The currency will be serviced by a collective of companies called the 'Libra Association'. It functions as what is known as a 'stablecoin', pegged to existing assets like the dollar or euro, in the aim of making it less subject to the volatility that many cryptocurrencies experience.</p>\n    <p>The Libra Association is described by Facebook as an independent, not-for-profit organisation based in Switzerland. Within the Libra Association will be a governing body called the Libra Association Council, comprised of a representative of each member of the association, which will vote on policy and operating decisions.</p>\n    <p>Facebook claims that although it created the Libra Association and the Libra Blockchain, once the currency is launched in 2020 the company will withdraw from a leadership role and all members of the association will have equal votes in governance of Libra. The companies who contributed a minimum of $10m(\u00a38m) to be listed as founding members of the Libra Association include tech companies such as PayPal, Ebay, Spotify, Uber and Lyft, as well as financial and venture capital firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, Visa and Mastercard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>However in October 2019 several of the companies that had been backing the initiative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/11/payment-firms-back-out-in-painful-blow-to-facebooks-cryptocurrency-libra\">announced that they were pulling out</a>, including Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Stripe.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How and when can I use it?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>With regulators asking questions and backing companies dropping out, it is unclear now if Libra is still viable. Facebook's original plans were that users could download Calibra, a digital wallet, that would allow them to send the currency to anyone with a smartphone. It is no longer clear which countries the coin will launch in first, if at all, though Facebook had said 'almost anybody' in the world with a smartphone would be able to download the app.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kari-paul\"><b>Kari Paul</b></a>&nbsp;in <i>San Francisco</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Although Facebook has spearheaded the development of Libra, and will be creating the first consumer \u201cwallet\u201d for the currency through its Calibra subsidiary, the actual development of the service will be handed over to the Libra Association, an arms-length organisation headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.</p> \n<p>The association is run nominally by a consortium of Libra\u2019s initial backers, including Visa, Lyft, Vodafone and Coinbase, of which Facebook is just one partner among many.

Census forms to leave out question that could affect elections The Trump administration has said it will print forms for the 2020 US census without a question on citizenship, after the supreme court blocked its inclusion last week. The commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, said he strongly disagreed with the court\u2019s decision to block the question, which critics argued would dissuade immigrants from submitting their census forms, leading to an inaccurate survey with potentially major political ramifications. Migrant detention.

Activist retrial.

Democrats sue administration for Trump\u2019s tax returns The House ways and means committee has sued the Trump administration in federal court for access to Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns, setting up a legal showdown over the documents between Democrats and the White House. The treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, has refused to turn over the president\u2019s returns, which the Democrat-controlled committee said it needs for an investigation into Trump\u2019s tax-law compliance.

Critics of the president have savaged his plans for a Fourth of July celebration in Washington DC, which they fear Trump will turn into a political campaign rally. Union-busting. Workers at the Social Security Administration say a new contract limiting union activity could herald a crackdown by the Trump administration on labor organising among federal government employees. Deep-sea mining boom threatens crucial ecosystems Some of the Earth\u2019s most important ecosystems could be threatened by a boom in deep-sea mining, as companies seeking new mineral and metal sources turn to the deep ocean as a \u201cnew industrial frontier\u201d.

The US produces far more garbage and recycles far less of it than other developed countries, according to analysis that found Americans produce 12% of global municipal solid waste, despite making up 4% of the world\u2019s population.

      "body": "<p>Theresa May is to warn her potential successors that a no-deal Brexit threatens the UK\u2019s future, in her final speech in Scotland as prime minister.</p> <p>May will also unveil plans for a review into the role of Whitehall departments in the devolved nations, in a move expected to lead to increased direct spending by the UK government in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p> <p>She will travel to Scotland on the eve of a widely anticipated Conservative leadership hustings between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt in Perth on Friday evening, which is likely to focus heavily on Holyrood\u2019s powers.</p> <p>Recent opinion polls show increased support for independence, particularly if Johnson becomes prime minister and presses ahead with a no-deal Brexit. A Panelbase poll for the Sunday Times last weekend put the yes vote at 49%, excluding don\u2019t knows, with 51% favouring a referendum if the UK left the EU.</p> <p>Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NicolaSturgeon/status/1146128356091551745\">tweeted that May\u2019s visit</a> was \u201ca desperate act by a prime minister who has shown zero respect for the Scottish parliament during her time in office\u201d.</p> <p>She added: \u201cIt\u2019s for the Scottish people \u2013 not a Tory PM \u2013 to consider and decide what future we want for our parliament and country.\u201d</p> <p>Sturgeon has said she wants a fresh independence referendum next year and has tabled legislation to enable referendums to take place in Scotland if the UK government hands Holyrood the powers to stage one.</p> <p>Both Johnson and Hunt have ruled out giving her those powers but senior Scottish Tories fear the Brexit crisis and Johnson\u2019s expected victory in the leadership election <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/23/boris-johnson-as-pm-would-be-catastrophe-for-uk-say-scottish-tories\">will substantially boost support</a> for an early independence referendum.</p> <p>Whitehall sources say May\u2019s review, which will be headed by the former Scotland Office minister Lord Dunlop, will focus on giving UK departments an enhanced role in devolved countries in an effort to strengthen the union and share its resources.</p> <p>One source said the prime minister wanted Whitehall departments to stop treating devolved nations as areas they were no longer concerned with. The Scotland Office and Wales Office are likely to be enlarged rather than merged into a new department.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to get a real shift in mindset in Whitehall,\u201d he said. \u201cThe emphasis needs to be not so much on the mechanics of devolution. The emphasis needs to be much more on sustaining the union.\u201d</p> <p>He pointed to UK government funding for a new 1,000-seater concert hall in central Edinburgh designed by Sir David Chipperfield and a rescue package to save Perth city hall from demolition.

      "bodyText": "Theresa May is to warn her potential successors that a no-deal Brexit threatens the UK\u2019s future, in her final speech in Scotland as prime minister. May will also unveil plans for a review into the role of Whitehall departments in the devolved nations, in a move expected to lead to increased direct spending by the UK government in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. She will travel to Scotland on the eve of a widely anticipated Conservative leadership hustings between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt in Perth on Friday evening, which is likely to focus heavily on Holyrood\u2019s powers. Recent opinion polls show increased support for independence, particularly if Johnson becomes prime minister and presses ahead with a no-deal Brexit. A Panelbase poll for the Sunday Times last weekend put the yes vote at 49%, excluding don\u2019t knows, with 51% favouring a referendum if the UK left the EU. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, tweeted that May\u2019s visit was \u201ca desperate act by a prime minister who has shown zero respect for the Scottish parliament during her time in office\u201d. She added: \u201cIt\u2019s for the Scottish people \u2013 not a Tory PM \u2013 to consider and decide what future we want for our parliament and country.\u201d Sturgeon has said she wants a fresh independence referendum next year and has tabled legislation to enable referendums to take place in Scotland if the UK government hands Holyrood the powers to stage one. Both Johnson and Hunt have ruled out giving her those powers but senior Scottish Tories fear the Brexit crisis and Johnson\u2019s expected victory in the leadership election will substantially boost support for an early independence referendum. Whitehall sources say May\u2019s review, which will be headed by the former Scotland Office minister Lord Dunlop, will focus on giving UK departments an enhanced role in devolved countries in an effort to strengthen the union and share its resources. One source said the prime minister wanted Whitehall departments to stop treating devolved nations as areas they were no longer concerned with. The Scotland Office and Wales Office are likely to be enlarged rather than merged into a new department. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get a real shift in mindset in Whitehall,\u201d he said. \u201cThe emphasis needs to be not so much on the mechanics of devolution. The emphasis needs to be much more on sustaining the union.\u201d He pointed to UK government funding for a new 1,000-seater concert hall in central Edinburgh designed by Sir David Chipperfield and a rescue package to save Perth city hall from demolition. Both came through city deals jointly funded by the UK and Scottish governments, but both projects would normally be regarded as devolved policy areas. It is thought Johnson and Hunt support May\u2019s proposed review but have said they will not be bound to accept Dunlop\u2019s recommendations. Recent opinion polls have also shown that Scottish voters trust the Scottish government far more than the UK government \u2013 a trend that has grown with successive Tory governments in power in London. The Scottish National party has a clear and substantial lead over the Conservatives and Labour in polling on both Holyrood and Westminster elections, with voters putting much greater emphasis on Europe and the future of the UK since the 2016 EU referendum. Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, believes Johnson may call a snap general election before the end of October in an attempt to win a mandate for a no-deal Brexit. There is also speculation Johnson would call an election later in the year if the Commons voted down his Brexit plans. Under either scenario, Scottish Tories have warned Johnson and Hunt they face losing many of the 13 seats they won in 2017. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, has been told Labour has no hope of winning the 20 Scottish seats he needs to secure a Commons majority if he continues to back Brexit. Meanwhile, the Cabinet Office published a new agreement between the UK and devolved governments on joint working between the four administrations \u2013 which includes Northern Ireland despite the collapse of Stormont\u2019s power-sharing government. The short document said all four governments \u201cagree that devolution is an established part of the UK\u2019s constitutional arrangements\u201d. It committed the four to maintain \u201cpositive and constructive relations based on mutual respect\u201d. Whitehall officials said this agreement and a series of joint frameworks on inter-governmental cooperation and shared policies undermined Sturgeon\u2019s repeated claims that the UK government was planning a power grab and had failed to listen to her government. David Mundell, the Scotland secretary, said: \u201cI\u2019m very pleased that we continue to make good progress on how our governments will work together as the UK leaves the EU. It is further evidence of our governments collaborating effectively, as people expect us to do.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s markets regulator has proposed a ban on financial instruments linked to digital cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, warning that such products could cause huge losses for retail consumers unlikely to understand their risks or value. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said products such as derivatives and exchange-traded notes (ETNs) that reference crypto-assets were \u201cill-suited\u201d to small investors. It cited their \u201cextreme volatility\u201d, the difficulty in valuing them, consumers\u2019 patchy understanding of what they were buying and the increased risk of financial crime. Investors might \u201csuffer harm from sudden and unexpected losses if they invest in these products\u201d, the FCA said, estimating that a ban would benefit consumers to the tune of between \u00a375m and \u00a3234.3m a year. The proposed ban would affect complex financial products such as contracts for difference (CFDs), options and futures, as well as exchange traded notes. Christopher Woolard, the executive director of strategy and competition at the FCA, said: \u201cAs with our work on the wider CFD and binary options markets, we will act when we see poor products being sold to retail consumers. These are complex contracts built on top of complex assets. \u201cMost consumers cannot reliably value derivatives based on unregulated crypto-assets. Prices are extremely volatile and as we have seen globally, financial crime in crypto-asset markets can lead to sudden and unexpected losses. \u201cIt is therefore clear to us that these derivatives and exchange traded notes are unsuitable investments for retail consumers.\u201d Woolard has previously warned Facebook that its plans for a new cryptocurrency called Libra, due to be launched next year, will warrant intense scrutiny from regulators. One of Facebook\u2019s co-founders, Chris Hughes, said this month that Libra could allow corporations involved in the scheme to wield power over nation states. One of the FCA\u2019s concerns is the volatility in the price of digital currencies, with fluctuations in the value of bitcoin proving a prime example. The price of bitcoin fell below $10,000 (\u00a37,950) on Tuesday, down 30% from last week\u2019s peak of nearly $14,000. Bitcoin had languished below $6,000 for months but was galvanised by Facebook\u2019s Libra plans. It has a history of wild swings and some analysts say it could rise back to $20,000 again \u2013 or fall as low as $3,000. In late 2017 it nearly reached $20,000 before a spectacular collapse in 2018. Its instability is among the factors that have dampened expectations about its ability to disrupt the global financial system.",

      "body": "<p>It started with an email. My brother-in-law had died of cancer and I posted a tribute on Facebook. Shortly afterwards, an email arrived from someone I didn\u2019t know, expressing their condolences for my loss and saying it made their \u201csnarky comments\u201d on Twitter seem petty and ill-timed. I knew, of course, that this was their way of alerting me to what they had actually said on Twitter. It was mostly the usual trolling that can be found on the most antisocial of social networks. I chose to ignore it. Like many writers, I spend a fair amount of time on Twitter. Learning to ignore the trolls is part of the job.</p> <p>But this particular troll refused to be ignored. The snarky comments gave way to homophobic insults. I was called \u201cpansy\u201d, \u201cfag\u201d, \u201cqueer\u201d and \u201cgaylord\u201d. At the time, I was employed as LGBT editor at Time Out, so I was running my personal Twitter account and a second account on behalf of the magazine. The tweets kept coming. Some days there would be one or two. Other days, there would be dozens. When Guardian Weekend magazine ran a dedicated gay issue, I shared the link on Twitter and headed off to the gym. By the time I arrived, my mentions were mostly from this person. \u201cGAY, GAY, GAY, GAY, GAY!\u201d read one. Another described me as \u201cthe Aids generation\u201d.</p> <p>Like many gay men my age, I lost a lot of people to Aids. Before becoming a journalist, I was an Aids activist. By the time I was 25, I had buried half my friends. I had written about this. I didn\u2019t need reminding of the fact by someone clearly trying to trigger an emotional response.</p> <p>I blocked the account sending the tweets, thinking this would be the end of it. But I hadn\u2019t counted on how determined my cyber-stalker was to make their presence felt. Because I use Twitter largely for work, my accounts were public. So they simply logged off Twitter, opened their browser and checked to see whom I was engaging with, then continued to tag me and several others in their tweets. If one person responded, the mention would appear in my notifications and I would be alerted to what was being said.</p> <p>I posted a tweet asking them to stop harassing me and threatened legal action if they continued. I asked my Twitter followers not to respond to their tweets. None of it made any difference. If anything, the situation escalated. There were comments on the Time Out website and on various other sites where my work was published. The accused posted blogs describing me as a \u201cmiddle-class wanker\u201d and accusing me of \u201cgayism\u201d. They doctored my Wikipedia page, deleting large parts of my bibliography and other professional achievements. They continued to send me emails from various accounts, CCing friends and work associates to ensure that I got the message. No sooner had I blocked one email address than they would create another. I discovered that I wasn\u2019t the only target. Others included well-known feminist columnists, some of whom wrote for this newspaper. But despite the person\u2019s reputation as a notorious troll, there were no photographs to be found anywhere on the internet. </p> <p>To understand the emotional and psychological impact of online harassment, you have to consider the amount of time many of us spend in front of our computers or glued to our phones. In my line of work, email is the main method of communication. Authors and journalists are expected to have a strong online presence, which means a considerable amount of time is spent on Facebook and Twitter. And that\u2019s not counting the hours you might choose to spend on social media for personal reasons. Online harassment affects you in the workplace, on the move and at home. Abusive tweets and emails are often the first thing you see in the morning and the last thing you see before switching off your devices. It quickly reached the point where I dreaded logging on to my computer or checking my phone.</p> <p>I spoke to friends, who were becoming increasingly concerned about the impact the harassment was having on me. I was drinking heavily and in a state of constant anxiety. One female friend was worried that the person stalking me might be dangerous. So when they started booking tickets for my author events and posting photos of the tickets on Twitter with threats to come and challenge me in person, I became increasingly alarmed. The stalker could be anyone sitting in the audience at one of my events. They could be harmless. Or, for all I knew, they could be carrying a knife.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8a62e13b1bc0a6d3675378c8a73493b73e90715d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a62e13b1bc0a6d3675378c8a73493b73e90715d/0_693_3992_4990/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I was drinking heavily and in a state of constant anxiety.\u2019\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I was drinking heavily and in a state of constant anxiety.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two things then happened at once. A friend who had also been targeted called to say she had identified our stalker. Then, one of the judges on the Polari First Book prize, which I had recently set up, received an email enquiring about submissions. The prize is for debut books exploring LGBT themes. The inquiry came from my stalker. The judge replied saying they could submit their self-published book, but that we weren\u2019t able to accept submissions under a pseudonym. They came back confirming their real name and address.</p> <p>Despite the fact that many of her tweets expressed views commonly held by men\u2019s rights activists, my stalker was a woman. It took me a few weeks before I finally did what I should have done months previously and reported her to the police.</p> <p>The detective asked what took me so long. The truth is, I was embarrassed to admit that I was being bullied by a woman. I was bullied a lot as a child \u2013 usually by other boys, always on the basis that I was \u201ca poof\u201d \u2013 and the shame still lingered. I have also been on the receiving end of homophobic abuse as an adult \u2013 but that was either verbal or physical and therefore seemed more \u201creal\u201d. When I was waiting to give a statement at Brixton police station, my eyes were drawn to a poster urging people to report domestic violence. The stark image of a woman\u2019s battered, bruised face made my complaint seem petty by comparison. The online nature of the harassment made me question whether the police would take me seriously. Thankfully, they did.</p> <p>It took several months before an arrest was made and the accused charged under the Malicious Communications Act. For weeks, I had personal security whenever I appeared at public events and I had to keep a record of every unsolicited email and unwanted social media contact in order to help the police build a case and persuade the CPS to prosecute. Naively, I had assumed that once I reported the crime, someone else would monitor the accused\u2019s online behaviour. But the police don\u2019t have the resources. The detective stressed that a case such as mine all depended on the volume of evidence. So I had to keep copies of every email and take screenshots of every abusive, homophobic tweet, print them out and then give further police statements where I had to relive the abuse and its impact.</p> <p>The police referred me to victim support, but I didn\u2019t contact them. Why? I think, on some level, I hated the thought of being seen as a victim. I have been a gay rights activist since the 80s and have lived through a period of enormous social change. Acknowledging my victimhood felt like a step backwards. But I was certainly in need of support. I was having trouble sleeping. I went to see my GP, broke down in his surgery and was prescribed antidepressants. I had never been on antidepressants before and I hated the way they made me feel. I became unfocused. I found it difficult to write. I still had trouble sleeping.</p> <p>I first saw the accused long before taking the witness stand. Approaching the court building on the first morning of the trial, I spotted a slightly dishevelled, skittish-looking woman, about 40, accompanied by an older man whom I took to be her father. Something in my gut immediately told me it was her. Sure enough, as soon as she saw me, the look on her face turned to one of panic and she scuttled off.</p> <p>Two things crossed my mind. One, that she was a typical keyboard warrior, brave behind a screen, but not so courageous in real life. Two, that something about her wasn\u2019t quite right. Her appearance and body language suggested that this was someone with problems. I would have probably felt pity for her, had she not caused me so much distress.</p> <p>Testifying in court is a nerve-racking business. However much the police and prosecution tell you otherwise, it is hard not to feel that you are the one on trial. The defence made light of the homophobic nature of the harassment, dismissing it as \u201cplayful banter\u201d and suggesting that I was oversensitive. They argued that I am a public figure on a social media platform and should therefore be open to healthy debate. I insisted that healthy debate does not include the right to harass and abuse someone, and that the defendant\u2019s behaviour towards me was homophobic and relentless. The district judge agreed and found her guilty of harassment without violence. Unlike racial or faith-motivated offences, there is no \u201caggravated offence\u201d legislation in UK law for crimes motivated by homophobia. But, in her summing up, the judge stressed the homophobic nature of the case. The defendant was given a two-year suspended sentence and issued with a restraining order.</p> <p>Having finally seen my cyber-stalker in the flesh, I assumed that the anxiety she provoked in me would quickly dissipate. My biggest fear had been not knowing whom I was dealing with. Now that fear had been put to rest, I thought I would put the whole thing behind me. But the impact of the harassment lingered long after the trial was over. I had nightmares most nights and flashbacks during the day. I was restless, hyper-alert and easily startled. Sometimes, I would see random women on the tube and my heart would pound, convinced for a moment that it was her. On the advice of my GP, I continued taking antidepressants for several months. I also sought help from victim support. I saw a counsellor, who told me I was suffering from a form of PTSD.</p> <p>What nobody tells you is that about 40% of people issued with a restraining order breach it within a few months. I am pleased to say that I neither saw nor heard from this person again. But what if I had? I was already at my wits\u2019 end. Had she continued to harass me, what would I have done? I knew who she was and where she lived. Might I have been tempted to take the law into my own hands? I like to think not, but I couldn\u2019t say for certain. That scared me. It also gave me the seed of an idea for a novel.</p> <p>The Closer I Get is a psychological thriller that doesn\u2019t end with the villain being apprehended or facing prosecution. It is about a writer who is stalked by an obsessive fan and what happens after she has been found guilty. How does a victim of harassment put their life back together when the trial is over and justice has been served? And what drives someone to harass someone they don\u2019t know in the first place? The characters in my story are entirely fictional. This being a psychological thriller, the line between protagonist and antagonist is deliberately blurred. But the underlying dynamic is one I understand all too well.</p> <p>Writing the book was daunting. Would it reopen old wounds? Would my mental health be affected? But turning a traumatic experience into a work of fiction proved enormously therapeutic. Before, I was still consumed with anger at the woman who harassed me. Now, I feel nothing but pity for her. And that is far easier to live with.</p> <p><em>The Closer I Get by Paul Burston is published by Orenda Books on 11 July</em></p>",

Something in my gut immediately told me it was her. Sure enough, as soon as she saw me, the look on her face turned to one of panic and she scuttled off. Two things crossed my mind. One, that she was a typical keyboard warrior, brave behind a screen, but not so courageous in real life. Two, that something about her wasn\u2019t quite right. Her appearance and body language suggested that this was someone with problems. I would have probably felt pity for her, had she not caused me so much distress. Testifying in court is a nerve-racking business. However much the police and prosecution tell you otherwise, it is hard not to feel that you are the one on trial. The defence made light of the homophobic nature of the harassment, dismissing it as \u201cplayful banter\u201d and suggesting that I was oversensitive. They argued that I am a public figure on a social media platform and should therefore be open to healthy debate. I insisted that healthy debate does not include the right to harass and abuse someone, and that the defendant\u2019s behaviour towards me was homophobic and relentless. The district judge agreed and found her guilty of harassment without violence. Unlike racial or faith-motivated offences, there is no \u201caggravated offence\u201d legislation in UK law for crimes motivated by homophobia. But, in her summing up, the judge stressed the homophobic nature of the case. The defendant was given a two-year suspended sentence and issued with a restraining order. Having finally seen my cyber-stalker in the flesh, I assumed that the anxiety she provoked in me would quickly dissipate. My biggest fear had been not knowing whom I was dealing with. Now that fear had been put to rest, I thought I would put the whole thing behind me. But the impact of the harassment lingered long after the trial was over. I had nightmares most nights and flashbacks during the day. I was restless, hyper-alert and easily startled. Sometimes, I would see random women on the tube and my heart would pound, convinced for a moment that it was her. On the advice of my GP, I continued taking antidepressants for several months. I also sought help from victim support. I saw a counsellor, who told me I was suffering from a form of PTSD. What nobody tells you is that about 40% of people issued with a restraining order breach it within a few months. I am pleased to say that I neither saw nor heard from this person again. But what if I had? I was already at my wits\u2019 end. Had she continued to harass me, what would I have done? I knew who she was and where she lived. Might I have been tempted to take the law into my own hands? I like to think not, but I couldn\u2019t say for certain. That scared me. It also gave me the seed of an idea for a novel. The Closer I Get is a psychological thriller that doesn\u2019t end with the villain being apprehended or facing prosecution. It is about a writer who is stalked by an obsessive fan and what happens after she has been found guilty. How does a victim of harassment put their life back together when the trial is over and justice has been served? And what drives someone to harass someone they don\u2019t know in the first place? The characters in my story are entirely fictional. This being a psychological thriller, the line between protagonist and antagonist is deliberately blurred. But the underlying dynamic is one I understand all too well. Writing the book was daunting. Would it reopen old wounds? Would my mental health be affected? But turning a traumatic experience into a work of fiction proved enormously therapeutic. Before, I was still consumed with anger at the woman who harassed me. Now, I feel nothing but pity for her. And that is far easier to live with. The Closer I Get by Paul Burston is published by Orenda Books on 11 July",

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.</p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europeif there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The latest snapshot revealed subdued activity in the sector forming the backbone of the British economy, which includes finance, transport and telecommunications, in a survey of 650 services firms that is closely monitored by the Treasury and the Bank of England.

One test of any revival, and it is one that Jeremy Herrin\u2019s production largely passes, is that you should feel that the Nothing On company is composed of querulous eccentrics. Jonathan Cullen stands out as the kind of fretful actor always seeking a rational motivation for farce\u2019s giddy mechanics and Daniel Rigby runs him close as a bullish extrovert who challenges the director\u2019s authority without ever quite being able to finish a sentence. Meera Syal might make more of the seen-it-all-before weariness of Dotty, the sardine-obsessed housekeeper, but there is good work from Simon Rouse as a permanently sozzled veteran, Lloyd Owen as the lordly director and Lois Chimimba as an exploited stage manager. Occasionally, I thought Herrin, in the backstage scene, was overdoing the joke of Dotty\u2019s being discovered in supposedly compromising positions. But Frayn\u2019s play is like a piece of clockwork that still functions impeccably almost 40 years after its invention. \u2022 At the Lyric Hammersmith, London, until 27 July.",

The Association Football Development Programme (AFDP) Global launched the #FearlessFootball campaign with support from more than 75 figures from within the game. These include the Afghanistan women\u2019s team\u2019s manager, Kelly Lindsey; the Chelsea women\u2019s manager, Emma Hayes; the former England forward Eni Aluko, who is also a Guardian columnist; several former USA women\u2019s internationals including Heather O\u2019Reilly; the former internationals Jamie Carragher, Robbie Fowler and Robert Pires; and Uefa\u2019s president, Aleksander Ceferin.

Or percentage of goals which impact on a result \u2013 which reduces the distorting effect of the Thailand thumping a bit.\u201d</strong></p> <p>Unfortunately the Knowledge hasn\u2019t got the budget to afford a team of statisticians big enough to leaf through result-affecting penalties at major tournaments, Thomas. In fact, we\u2019re going to simplify this by sticking to World Cups (men\u2019s and women\u2019s), particularly so because the two most recent (France 2019 and Russia 2018) have been played in the era of VAR. If we look at Brazil 2014, 11 of the 167 goals scored in the 64 games played were penalties. This works out at just 6.6%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/oct/08/worst.ever.penalty.shootouts\">Football: The Knowledge - which was the worst ever penalty shoot-out?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Four years later, at Russia 2018, of the 169 goals scored, 22 were penalties, a much higher figure of 13.02%. The clampdown on pushing and pulling on corners was probably as much of an influence on penalties given as VAR was in that particular tournament. Interestingly, though, at the Women\u2019s World Cup in 2015 \u2013 where VAR was not in use \u2013 the percentage of goals from penalties was 12.32% (18 of 146 goals), which seems quite high for a non-VAR tournament.</p> <p>So, fast-forward to France 2019 and of the 140 goals scored so far, 17 have been penalties, which works out at a figure of 12.14%, just down on Canada 2015 and Russia 2018.

      "bodyText": "\u201cIs the Women\u2019s World Cup the most penalty-ish tournament ever?\u201d asks Thomas Levine. \u201cEither in terms of percentage of goals? Or percentage of goals which impact on a result \u2013 which reduces the distorting effect of the Thailand thumping a bit.\u201d Unfortunately the Knowledge hasn\u2019t got the budget to afford a team of statisticians big enough to leaf through result-affecting penalties at major tournaments, Thomas. In fact, we\u2019re going to simplify this by sticking to World Cups (men\u2019s and women\u2019s), particularly so because the two most recent (France 2019 and Russia 2018) have been played in the era of VAR. If we look at Brazil 2014, 11 of the 167 goals scored in the 64 games played were penalties. This works out at just 6.6%. Four years later, at Russia 2018, of the 169 goals scored, 22 were penalties, a much higher figure of 13.02%. The clampdown on pushing and pulling on corners was probably as much of an influence on penalties given as VAR was in that particular tournament. Interestingly, though, at the Women\u2019s World Cup in 2015 \u2013 where VAR was not in use \u2013 the percentage of goals from penalties was 12.32% (18 of 146 goals), which seems quite high for a non-VAR tournament. So, fast-forward to France 2019 and of the 140 goals scored so far, 17 have been penalties, which works out at a figure of 12.14%, just down on Canada 2015 and Russia 2018. There are still three matches to play, though, so if VAR continues to be called on when arms are deemed to have been in unnatural positions, this could change. The highest percentage from World Cups before 2014 that we could find was 8.8% at Germany 2006, where 13 of the 147 goals scored came from the spot.

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.</p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europeif there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Kevin Keaney, the chief executive of cut-price toys and books retailer The Works, said it had brought in products for one of its key Christmas deals five weeks earlier than last year and had increased stocks in stores by 10% as a way to insulate itself against shortages in the run-up to the peak trading period in December.</p> \n<p>He said the October deadline was a concern \u201cless so about bringing in stock but about the customer impact and the distraction it may cause\u201d.</p> \n<p>Keaney said he was optimistic about Christmas, with the new Frozen film expected to lead to a boom in sales of related products, but he added: \u201cThe timing [of the Brexit deadline] for any retailer is particularly unhelpful.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Tesco chief executive, Dave Lewis, also warned that planning for the October Brexit deadline was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-48844351\">\u201cmore difficult\u201d</a> because the supply network would be full of Christmas stock and said the imposition of tariffs under a no-deal Brexit was likely to increase disruption.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the dailyBusinessToday email or follow GuardianBusinesson Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>With the potential Brexit difficulties on the horizon, Coupe would not say when Sainsbury\u2019s might be able to turn around its disappointing sales performance.</p> \n<p>Sales at established stores, excluding fuel, fell 1.6% in the 16 weeks to 29 June, worse than the 0.9% fall in the previous quarter.

The Sainsbury\u2019s boss said he had repeatedly made clear to government officials that a \u201chard-edged Brexit would be very disruptive to our business and people\u2019s Christmas this year\u201d. Kevin Keaney, the chief executive of cut-price toys and books retailer The Works, said it had brought in products for one of its key Christmas deals five weeks earlier than last year and had increased stocks in stores by 10% as a way to insulate itself against shortages in the run-up to the peak trading period in December. He said the October deadline was a concern \u201cless so about bringing in stock but about the customer impact and the distraction it may cause\u201d. Keaney said he was optimistic about Christmas, with the new Frozen film expected to lead to a boom in sales of related products, but he added: \u201cThe timing [of the Brexit deadline] for any retailer is particularly unhelpful.\u201d The Tesco chief executive, Dave Lewis, also warned that planning for the October Brexit deadline was \u201cmore difficult\u201d because the supply network would be full of Christmas stock and said the imposition of tariffs under a no-deal Brexit was likely to increase disruption. With the potential Brexit difficulties on the horizon, Coupe would not say when Sainsbury\u2019s might be able to turn around its disappointing sales performance. Sales at established stores, excluding fuel, fell 1.6% in the 16 weeks to 29 June, worse than the 0.9% fall in the previous quarter. Coupe blamed poor weather in comparison with last year\u2019s heatwave and a lack of feelgood events to match the royal wedding in 2018. Grocery sales fell by 0.5%, a similar level to the previous quarter, but clothing and general merchandise sales dramatically worsened, with falls of 4.5% and 3.1% respectively.",

It has taken a long time for the European champions to find some rhythm.

With only marginal room for error in European qualifying \u2013 only the top side in each five-team group were guaranteed progression \u2013 a shock draw with the Republic of Ireland and a 2-1 defeat by Norway ensured the Netherlands finished behind the latter. Reflecting just how hard it is to get through, they were paired with their Euro 2017 final opponents in a play-off semi-final, winning 4-1 over two legs, before producing the same aggregate score against Switzerland to clinch qualification. Before the World Cup, expectations were generally low, though not in the Netherlands.

For the rebels, it\u2019s the defining battle of their lives. For the empire, it\u2019s just Tuesday. England dipped into derangement after Steph Houghton\u2019s penalty was saved, with Millie Bright sent off and Demi Stokes dropping the ball to concede a foul throw, while the US shepherded out the match with inevitable efficiency; doing just enough, as in the quarter-final against France. The British media tried its best to provoke some conflict after the pre-game revelation that a couple of US staffers were found in England\u2019s hotel, touring it as an option ahead of the final. Investigating the location of the breakfast buffet and the price of a 500ml bottle of Evian from the mini-bar was shaped into a spy scandal, as if Phil Neville might have accidentally left \u201cSTART RACHEL DALY OUT WIDE\u201d scrawled on the whiteboard in the Fourvi\u00e8re Hotel\u2019s meeting room. Tuesday\u2019s semi-final would be a \u201cgrudge match\u201d, declared the Daily Star; \u201cEngland fury at World Cup \u2018Spygate\u2019 row: Manager Phil Neville in war of words with the US,\u201d roared the Daily Mail. While England were planting a St George\u2019s Cross on the moral high ground and fussing over why the Americans couldn\u2019t just read the reviews on TripAdvisor, the US simply went about their business before and during the match, paying due deference to the opposition\u2019s threat but not reserving any singular treatment for Neville\u2019s team, save for a taunt. Alex Morgan clearly likes her tea served ice-cold. (Although someone should tell her that we increasingly prefer coffee these days.) Her Lyon Tea Party celebration was the most withering put-down since the exchange between the characters Martin and Bob, a school bully, when they meet again as adults in the 1997 film, Grosse Point Blank: \u201cDo you really believe that there\u2019s some stored-up conflict that exists between us? There is no us. We don\u2019t exist.\u201d Having said that, the US annoying England with their celebrations wasn\u2019t anything personal: they reserved the same treatment for Thailand and Chile. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything special about the England match-up in particular on the women\u2019s side\u2026 everyone else\u2019s biggest game is against us,\u201d one American friend told me before the game. \u201cWith the women, we\u2019re the imperialist juggernaut that everyone wants to knock down.\u201d \u201cNo added edge,\u201d said another. \u201cThe US is a cut above everyone and the arrogance of the team, fans and media show it. It\u2019s the opposite to the men.\u201d In the moments after the US sealed their quarter-final against France, Megan Rapinoe admitted she didn\u2019t even know that England were up next. In the men\u2019s game, English encounters with the US are freighted with a strange tension: a superiority complex masking deep-rooted anxiety, because if America ever overtakes us in football, then what, as a country, do we have left? They\u2019re even staging sold-out baseball games in a London football stadium during the Cricket World Cup! That dynamic is absent in the women\u2019s game, given the US\u2019s long-held supremacy and England\u2019s more recent strides. Still, there is something about the nation\u2019s psyche that craves American attention and respect - the UK, after all, is a country willing to spend \u00a318m of taxpayers\u2019 money so that Donald Trump could play golf in Scotland and visit Windsor Castle, in the same year it closed about 130 public libraries. And what do we get in return? Perhaps a few crates of value-priced chlorinated chicken after 31 October, and a deserved defeat where there was more talk Stateside about a player who didn\u2019t even take the field - Megan Rapinoe - than about anything the England team did.",

Launching a review of the overburdened system, Sir Andrew McFarlane, president of the family division, said some parents needed to be persuaded not to bring claims to court in order to reduce the pressure. Cuts to legal aid had also resulted in an influx of \u201clitigants in person\u201d, exposing district judges and magistrates to the fury of unrepresented and \u201cemotionally charged\u201d claimants who had sometimes posed a security risk, Mr Justice Cobb, who is in charge of private family law, acknowledged. Sounding the alarm over the state of the family courts, McFarlane said it was not clear why, but the volume of cases had increased significantly since the beginning of 2016 and there was no sign of it falling back. The number of \u201cpublic law\u201d applications for care or supervision orders \u2013 made by social services departments across England and Wales \u2013 has risen by about 25% over that period. The number of \u201cprivate law\u201d applications \u2013 made by parents over their own children \u2013 has also been rising and is at an all-time high. Last year, there were 53,164 new private law cases lodged involving 123,334 children. \u201cThe system is \u2026 trying to run up a down escalator,\u201d McFarlane said ahead of the launch of a public consultation on the family courts. \u201cEveryone is working flat-out but delays are creeping into the system.\u201d One aim of his review is to identify cases that could be resolved through mediation or dispute resolution. About a quarter or a third of the cases do not involve issues of domestic violence and raise no concern about the safety of a child. \u201cThey would be better dealt with persuading the parents not to come to court,\u201d McFarlane said. He accepted that there was unlikely to be any new money for extra court resources and is therefore proposing revenue-neutral changes to improve the efficiency of the court rather than far-reaching changes to the law. A report of the private family law working group headed by Cobb recommended that family justice boards around the country should create alliances of services \u201cto provide integrated support for all families experiencing separation\u201d. Diverting \u201cappropriate cases of conflictual family breakdown away from court\u201d was sensible \u201cnot merely because the court system is stretched to breaking point (and beyond) by current case volumes\u201d, the report noted, but because \u201cout-of-court services will offer better solutions for many families whose differences are more amenable to negotiated or conciliated agreement\u201d.

Her first solo single, \u201cLaunderette\u201d, from 1981, was produced by John Lydon and had the Raincoats\u2019 Vicky Aspinall on violin. She started her journalistic career on Sounds magazine, has written biographies of Marley and Kid Creole, and made music documentaries for Channel 4 and the BBC.

Shortly afterwards she heard Poly Styrene of X-Ray Spex singing \u201cOh Bondage, Up Yours!\u201d \u2013 \u201cI knew at once that with all its saucy frisson, the bondage she sang about was not S&amp;M; rather it was the patriarchy I had been hearing about since feminism had started to filter through just a few years before.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We find Grace Jones crying in a hotel elevator about her lover\u2019s view of her: \u2018He always wants me to be an animal\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The language is urgent, often furious, sometimes funny and full of piquant turns of phrase.

Wang claims to be pro-Trump \u2013 \u201cIt is doubtful he would return the favour\u201d, notes Goldman, dryly \u2013 and is vehemently anti-abortion (one of her songs is called \u201cKill Your Belly\u201d).

As Raphael points out, the artists featured in the new book, and the stories they tell, show how far women have come but also how far they have yet to go.

While their perspective would have been interesting, the book doesn\u2019t suffer from their absence. As <em>Revenge of the She-Punks</em> illustrates, there is value in understanding the experiences of the outliers, the outsiders and the women breaking through as well as the artists who have since switched careers or retreated from view. So we hear from Kate Tempest, Nadine Shah, Natalie Merchant, Mitski, Chvrches\u2019 Lauren Mayberry, Tracey Thorn, the French-Cuban twins Ibeyi and Christine, and Christine and the Queens\u2019 H\u00e9lo\u00efse Letissier. Their testimony is variously optimistic, troubling, joyful, illuminating, fierce and thoughtful. It is often all these things at once.

Some years earlier Mr Powyss had published an advertisement offering a reward of \u00a350 a year for life to any man willing to live for seven years underground without seeing another human face. While the successful applicant would be required to \u201clet his toe and fingernails grow during the whole of his confinement, together with his beard\u201d, his conditions would be comfortable, even luxurious: his \u201ccommodious apartments\u201d would include meals served from Mr Powyss\u2019s own table, a bathtub with cold running water, a chamber-organ, and \u201cas many books as the occupier should desire\u201d. According to the Register, a labouring man with a large family had accepted the post. He was, by 1797, in the \u201cfourth year of his probation\u201d.</p> <p>Intrigued, Nathan tried to discover more about Powyss and the outcome of his experiment, but without success. Nothing of either remained. Instead she turned to fiction, writing a pair of short stories that imagined the peculiar undertaking, the first from Powyss\u2019s point of view, \u201cAn Experiment: Above\u201d, and then, in \u201cAn Experiment: Below\u201d, from the solitary subterranean perspective of his confined subject. Both were included in her excellent 2014 collection, <em>His Last Fire</em>, which attracted acclaim from, among others, Hilary Mantel, who praised Nathan as \u201can original, with a virtuoso touch\u201d.</p> <p>The enthusiasm was well earned. \u201cAn Experiment: Above\u201d is a subtle and unsettling story of a reclusive gentleman scientist in the late Enlightenment mould whose ambitious experiment into the effects of unrelieved solitude on the human spirit has begun to trouble him. Though Powyss reassures himself that the man confined in his cellars is there of his own free will and, with his family amply provided for, enjoys an existence infinitely more easeful than before, he listens uneasily to the howls that echo up through the hearing tube he has secretly installed in the underground apartments. Meanwhile Powyss\u2019s growing affection for the man\u2019s wife and youngest daughter delights and discomfits him in equal measure. In a few short pages, the story conjures a man torn vividly between compassion and ambition, doubt and authority, conscience and desire.</p> <p>\u201cAn Experiment: Below\u201d is similarly nuanced, driven as much by the absences in the story as the story itself. Nathan\u2019s confined man, John Warlow, is a rough creature, brutish and coarse, but she makes something touching from his deep ache for the land and the seasons that mark it, his meticulously summoned fantasies of back-breaking labour, the overwhelming, maddening powerlessness of his situation. For all the callous inhumanity of Powyss\u2019s experiment, in Nathan\u2019s imagination its strictures guide both men to find within themselves a new and unexpected tenderness.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Mr Powyss of Lancashire offered \u00a350 a year to any man willing to live for seven years underground without seeing a human face</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Despite this, Powyss and his story continued to nag at Nathan; she could not shake the sense that it \u201cdeserved fuller consideration\u201d. The result is <em>The Warlow Experiment</em>. In incubating her twin stories to a full-length novel she has changed remarkably little of her original detail: a number of scenes survive almost unaltered. The sense that Nathan evokes so skilfully in her short fiction, that her stories are mere glimpses of a complex and fully realised world, is plainly a matter of fact.</p> <p>The larger canvas of a novel allows her to create a household for Powyss, to give voices and subplots to the servants required to serve his experiment, and to root the undertaking more firmly in its politically febrile times. In 1793, with Louis XVI recently guillotined and blood running through the streets of Paris, ideas of liberty, equality and fraternity were inflaming dissent on both sides of the Channel. The notion that a well-born man might deny a poor man his freedom, simply by dint of his rank and wealth, was no longer a matter for private conscience. While Powyss is little interested in politics, letters from his friend Benjamin Fox, a radical in London, punctuate the book.</p> <p>Unfortunately these, like too much of the new material, weigh the novel down. While Nathan\u2019s stories glitter, dangerous with hidden depth, the book plods, its plot fatally underpowered. It takes too long for the effects of Warlow\u2019s incarceration to gain momentum and, when at last the household cracks under its pressure, the events feel forced and improbable. More frustratingly, though the extra pages provide more detailed encounters with the two protagonists, these do little to deepen our understanding of either man. There are some powerful moments, but readers intrigued by the lost story of Powyss and his experiment would do better to seek out <em>His Last Fire</em>.

Ditching his prosthetic arm has liberated Askin.

From football \u2013 there are varieties for both <a href=\"http://www.childrensfootballalliance.com/frame-football/\">frames</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wheelpower.org.uk/sports/powerchair-football?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIuPCD5tCE4wIVh5PtCh1JnAHwEAAYASAAEgIvRvD_BwE\">powerchairs</a> \u2013 to wheelchair rugby, or blind and visually impaired tennis, disability sport is enjoying something of a boom. There is even table cricket: a specially adapted version of the game requiring no little skill, the national title of which was contested by more than 300 schools.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c6c9a37cca1e42b38d51ce0cae2550f970bc165\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c6c9a37cca1e42b38d51ce0cae2550f970bc165/0_282_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chris\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Edwards, captain of England\u2019s learning disability team supporting pupils at Millwood School</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claudia Janke</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Roughly one in five people in the UK report a disability and, according to a <a href=\"https://www.sportengland.org/media/11498/active-lives-survey-yr-1-report.pdf\">Sport England study</a> in 2015-16, those who do are more than twice as likely to be physically inactive.</p> \n<p>\u201cA 26-year-old lad got in touch,\u201d said Neil Bradshaw, the operations manager for England disability cricket. \u201cHe was injured in service, is registered disabled and used to play for the army cricket team.

He\u2019s coming for a trial in August.\u201d</p> \n<p>At the training session at the National Cricket Performance Centre in Loughborough, everyone has a backstory \u2013 teenage bone cancer, amputation, club feet, missing limbs \u2013 but sympathy is neither sought nor required. Respect and a stage to perform on: that\u2019ll do. That\u2019s why they\u2019re here. That and the chance to inspire the next generation to get involved.</p> \n<p>Joining the physically disabled elite at the weekend training camp are their counterparts from England\u2019s deaf squad.

Later this summer, England stages the first physical disability world cricket series, duking it out with India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe across nine days of T20 action in the West Midlands.</p> \n<p>The hope is that exposure, and the seeing-is-believing nature of disability cricket, will help achieve what the likes of Anya Shrubsole and Steph Houghton have done for women\u2019s sport. There are, as yet unconfirmed, plans to stream the games live. Millions would watch on the subcontinent. India\u2019s involvement, backed by the all-powerful cricket authorities there, could be a gamechanger.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe number of blind cricketers alone in India would drown the number of visually impaired athletes in Paralympic programmes across the world,\u201d says Ian Martin, the head of disability cricket at the England and Wales Cricket Board. \u201cAnd I think people often miss cricket\u2019s appeal to people with all disabilities \u2013 we aim to include, not exclude. At grassroots level, we can be proud to say we welcome anyone.\u201d</p> \n<p>Martin appreciates the game\u2019s potential reach so keenly because the story is also autobiographical. A lifelong and passionate club cricketer diagnosed with the muscle- and nerve-wasting condition Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome, he has singlemindedly pushed the disabled game forward over the past decade.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen I pull on my suit and look at the three lions on it, I\u2019m able to think back to the dreams that I had as a kid about representing England at cricket and realise that I\u2019ve achieved the dream and then some, just not in the way that I planned.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0cceb4b62ea472210ce72c61e0e930e6ab1cf6eb\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0cceb4b62ea472210ce72c61e0e930e6ab1cf6eb/0_117_3463_2077/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Toby Howe of England Lions runs into bowl during a England Physical Disability T20 match between England Seniors and England Lions.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Toby Howe of England Lions runs into bowl during a England Physical Disability T20 match between England Seniors and England Lions.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nathan Stirk/Getty/ECB</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This summer is a watershed for Martin and Bradshaw, both backroom veterans. Martin brokered the first PD international, between England and Pakistan in 2012. Bradshaw, who knits logistics together across the board, finally gave up his Matalan warehouse shift manager\u2019s gig to go full-time last year. His initial involvement, a decade back in Cheshire, was done as a favour. \u201cI got into it simply because I fancied a pint at a cricket club,\u201d he chuckles. \u201cI saw 10-12 disabled kids running their own warm-up, so just started helping out.\u201d</p> \n<p>Martin and Bradshaw are a tight partnership despite a bitter footballing rivalry (one is Everton, the other Liverpool). They have hundreds of shared miles under their belts building patiently for this moment. As Bradshaw sees it, fate just dealt these cricketers a different path: his remit is to push the envelope in search of validity.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s where our frustration lies,\u201d he says. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a sympathy setup because these lads can\u2019t get access to their cricket anywhere else. The standard\u2019s really high.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s educating people \u2013 getting away from the \u2018oh, bless them, isn\u2019t that nice?\u2019 attitude. People don\u2019t understand the game until they\u2019ve seen the game.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1fbce7dcb5cab1a923d58feb7062ee8a822bdb0a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1fbce7dcb5cab1a923d58feb7062ee8a822bdb0a/0_446_5056_3034/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liam Thomas and Liam O\u2019Brien at England disability cricket training, Loughborough\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liam Thomas and Liam O\u2019Brien at England Disability Cricket training, Loughborough</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Morgan/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Watching the training underscores his point: there is serious ability here, as evidenced when left-hander Thomas nails a succession of sweet shots against a bowling machine, deploying immaculate footwork. (His right leg ends just below the knee.)</p> \n<p>The coaching staff comprises ex-England Test cricketers Ian Salisbury and James Kirtley. The performance analyst, Chris Highton, is on hand to crunch the numbers and go through footage. Muscles and tweaks are tended by Scott Gormley and Richard Olejar, the latter physio a quietly spoken Slovakian taekwondo international known as \u201cthe assassin\u201d for reasons that later become clear.</p> \n<p>After a couple of hours power-hitting in front of the bowling machines, there is a performance analysis seminar with Highton, who urges the players to embrace the data and make it work for them.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s about making strengths super-strengths and weaknesses strengths,\u201d he says. Then it\u2019s down to the nitty gritty: batters v bowlers in a series of T20 scenarios. Fielding and catching drills complete the afternoon\u2019s work.\u201d</p> \n<p>The competitive instinct kicks in when the different teams come together to test out their skills. There is an eye-catching exchange when deaf fast bowler George Greenway, capable of whistling it down at almost 80mph, takes on Liam O\u2019Brien, who is not given to taking backward steps.</p> \n<p>\u201cMake sure you say he didn\u2019t get me out,\u201d he says of the tussle. He\u2019s only half joking.</p> \n<p>Honesty, friendship and integrity, winning on and off the pitch: these are constantly recurring themes across the weekend. Saturday evening is spent at the campus bar enjoying a couple of well-earned drinks, during which the squads start to mingle. Salisbury doesn\u2019t bang the drum about curfews.

      "bodyText": "Hit hard, flat, true and with a whip-crack report, the ball is still gathering pace as it thuds against the back wall of the training centre. Heads nod amid whoops of approval and excitement at what this talent could bring to England\u2019s cricket team. Not the bunch currently scrapping in the World Cup, or the team that will face Australia later this summer, but the gaggle of richly talented amateurs united by two powerful things they have in common: sport and disability. \u201cOur most improved player over the last couple of years,\u201d says Liam Thomas, the vice-captain of England\u2019s physical disability side, of the ball hitter, Matt Askin. Ditching his prosthetic arm has liberated Askin. He now flourishes his bat like a cheerleader\u2019s baton, larruping the ball further and faster than ever. \u201cHitting sixes with one hand, eh?\u201d adds Thomas. \u201cAmazing.\u201d Teachers, tilers, students, water workers and biscuit exporters by day, the men gathered here for a weekend training session are the elite among 60,000 people with disabilities playing cricket at one level or another. There is a burgeoning range of sports for people with disabilities: the Paralympics is just the tip of the iceberg. From football \u2013 there are varieties for both frames and powerchairs \u2013 to wheelchair rugby, or blind and visually impaired tennis, disability sport is enjoying something of a boom. There is even table cricket: a specially adapted version of the game requiring no little skill, the national title of which was contested by more than 300 schools. Roughly one in five people in the UK report a disability and, according to a Sport England study in 2015-16, those who do are more than twice as likely to be physically inactive. \u201cA 26-year-old lad got in touch,\u201d said Neil Bradshaw, the operations manager for England disability cricket. \u201cHe was injured in service, is registered disabled and used to play for the army cricket team. He\u2019s not been confident enough to reach out previously. He\u2019s coming for a trial in August.\u201d At the training session at the National Cricket Performance Centre in Loughborough, everyone has a backstory \u2013 teenage bone cancer, amputation, club feet, missing limbs \u2013 but sympathy is neither sought nor required. Respect and a stage to perform on: that\u2019ll do. That\u2019s why they\u2019re here. That and the chance to inspire the next generation to get involved. Joining the physically disabled elite at the weekend training camp are their counterparts from England\u2019s deaf squad. This innovative joint residential jaunt has been designed to bring together four sides \u2013 those with physical disability (PD), deafness, learning disability and visual impairment \u2013 under the overall disability umbrella. Sizing each other up in open-net sessions lends proceedings a keen edge on the cusp of a pivotal season, for the PD group in particular. Later this summer, England stages the first physical disability world cricket series, duking it out with India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe across nine days of T20 action in the West Midlands. The hope is that exposure, and the seeing-is-believing nature of disability cricket, will help achieve what the likes of Anya Shrubsole and Steph Houghton have done for women\u2019s sport. There are, as yet unconfirmed, plans to stream the games live. Millions would watch on the subcontinent. India\u2019s involvement, backed by the all-powerful cricket authorities there, could be a gamechanger. \u201cThe number of blind cricketers alone in India would drown the number of visually impaired athletes in Paralympic programmes across the world,\u201d says Ian Martin, the head of disability cricket at the England and Wales Cricket Board. \u201cAnd I think people often miss cricket\u2019s appeal to people with all disabilities \u2013 we aim to include, not exclude. At grassroots level, we can be proud to say we welcome anyone.\u201d Martin appreciates the game\u2019s potential reach so keenly because the story is also autobiographical. A lifelong and passionate club cricketer diagnosed with the muscle- and nerve-wasting condition Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome, he has singlemindedly pushed the disabled game forward over the past decade. \u201cWhen I pull on my suit and look at the three lions on it, I\u2019m able to think back to the dreams that I had as a kid about representing England at cricket and realise that I\u2019ve achieved the dream and then some, just not in the way that I planned.\u201d This summer is a watershed for Martin and Bradshaw, both backroom veterans. Martin brokered the first PD international, between England and Pakistan in 2012. Bradshaw, who knits logistics together across the board, finally gave up his Matalan warehouse shift manager\u2019s gig to go full-time last year. His initial involvement, a decade back in Cheshire, was done as a favour. \u201cI got into it simply because I fancied a pint at a cricket club,\u201d he chuckles. \u201cI saw 10-12 disabled kids running their own warm-up, so just started helping out.\u201d Martin and Bradshaw are a tight partnership despite a bitter footballing rivalry (one is Everton, the other Liverpool). They have hundreds of shared miles under their belts building patiently for this moment. As Bradshaw sees it, fate just dealt these cricketers a different path: his remit is to push the envelope in search of validity. \u201cThat\u2019s where our frustration lies,\u201d he says. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a sympathy setup because these lads can\u2019t get access to their cricket anywhere else. The standard\u2019s really high. \u201cIt\u2019s educating people \u2013 getting away from the \u2018oh, bless them, isn\u2019t that nice?\u2019 attitude. People don\u2019t understand the game until they\u2019ve seen the game.\u201d Watching the training underscores his point: there is serious ability here, as evidenced when left-hander Thomas nails a succession of sweet shots against a bowling machine, deploying immaculate footwork. (His right leg ends just below the knee.) The coaching staff comprises ex-England Test cricketers Ian Salisbury and James Kirtley. The performance analyst, Chris Highton, is on hand to crunch the numbers and go through footage. Muscles and tweaks are tended by Scott Gormley and Richard Olejar, the latter physio a quietly spoken Slovakian taekwondo international known as \u201cthe assassin\u201d for reasons that later become clear. After a couple of hours power-hitting in front of the bowling machines, there is a performance analysis seminar with Highton, who urges the players to embrace the data and make it work for them. \u201cIt\u2019s about making strengths super-strengths and weaknesses strengths,\u201d he says. Then it\u2019s down to the nitty gritty: batters v bowlers in a series of T20 scenarios. Fielding and catching drills complete the afternoon\u2019s work.\u201d The competitive instinct kicks in when the different teams come together to test out their skills. There is an eye-catching exchange when deaf fast bowler George Greenway, capable of whistling it down at almost 80mph, takes on Liam O\u2019Brien, who is not given to taking backward steps. \u201cMake sure you say he didn\u2019t get me out,\u201d he says of the tussle. He\u2019s only half joking. Honesty, friendship and integrity, winning on and off the pitch: these are constantly recurring themes across the weekend. Saturday evening is spent at the campus bar enjoying a couple of well-earned drinks, during which the squads start to mingle. Salisbury doesn\u2019t bang the drum about curfews. He doesn\u2019t have to: several of the players retreat to their digs before last orders. Sunday morning brings the opportunity to discover first-hand why Olejar has his nickname. Breakfast is at 7.45am. At 9am sharp, both squads \u2013 and, at Salisbury\u2019s insistence, your 50-year-old correspondent \u2013 warm up with Olejar. For 45 minutes, we are put through a series of hops and/or leaps up one, two, and then three steps. The theme to Rocky blares out as we pound the concrete. Then it\u2019s rigorous stretching inside before getting down to work again. By about 4pm we are done. Everyone goes their separate ways, back to the day jobs. There is a wistful, end-of-school-term air as the players drift off. Liam O\u2019Brien and spinner Fred Bridges plot their podcast listening on the journey back to Sussex. Dan Hamm, joker in the pack, alights upon Askin\u2019s discarded prosthesis. \u201cLook!\u201d he says, waving it like a triumphant detective cracking a case, \u201cwe\u2019ve found this \u2013 which must mean\u2026 there\u2019s a body somewhere!\u201d Askin, clearly familiar with this sketch, smiles and shrugs his shoulders. I mention that time has raced by: 48 hours gone in five minutes. \u201cYeah,\u201d Askin concurs, smiling broadly. \u201cI never want to go home.\u201d \u2022 A version of this article appeared in Wisden cricket monthly",

      "body": "<p>Among the epigraphs in <em>Flash Count Diary</em>, Darcey Steinke\u2019s incandescent account of the menopause, is a line from <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/jun/05/review-simone-de-beauvoir-the-second-sex\" title=\"\">The Second Sex</a></em> by Simone de Beauvoir: \u201cThe body is not a thing but a situation.\u201d Steinke is being assailed, even menaced by hot flushes. They come with a warning: first an aura, a vertigo-inducing plunge into anxiety, then an explosion of heat. They hit her at work, in bed, bringing insomnia and depression in their wake. They can be generated by the smallest shift in temperature \u2013 a plate of scrambled eggs placed too close to her stomach, the door closing on a bus. Lying on her sofa in Brooklyn, \u201ca slab of frozen ham balanced on my forehead\u201d, she recognises that she has become the butt of a cultural joke: the menopausal woman, out of oestrogen, evolutionary roadkill.</p> <p>In <em>Feminine Forever</em>, the 1966 book that kickstarted the popularity of HRT, she finds post-menopausal women described as \u201ccastrates\u201d with pathologically dry vaginas. Half a century on, not much has changed. At the 11th European Conference on Menopause and Andropause in Amsterdam, she watches a video about laser treatment to sandblast the menopausal vagina, accompanied by an animation that shows a withered brown rose transform into a tight pink bud. As an Italian doctor dismisses a nurse\u2019s concerns about the breast cancer risk of HRT, she realises \u201call his descriptions explain how the vagina might feel to an incoming penis\u201d. Is the problem really her body, this ageing animal thing, or a cultural situation that insists women\u2019s value is predominantly sexual or reproductive? And what is the word for this situation? Could it be patriarchy?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"60a76c241438d1d9d79b51e3e334348b773e9b80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60a76c241438d1d9d79b51e3e334348b773e9b80/0_0_183_275/183.jpg\" alt=\"Feminine Forever, 1966.\" width=\"183\" height=\"275\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Feminine Forever, 1966. \u2018The book that kickstarted the popularity of HRT\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Patriarchy as a concept was long out of fashion. As Katherine Angel explains in <em>Daddy Issues</em>, her smart, thoughtful essay about the cultural place of fathers in the #MeToo age, it was sunk alongside the corpse of second-wave feminism. \u201cThe nineties \u2013 decade of girl power, and of an insistence on women\u2019s economic and social freedom, on the condition that women themselves abandon a critique of gender relations \u2013 gave invocations of patriarchy, as it gave feminism, a fusty feel, an old-fashioned whiff, conjuring all the age-old stereotypes of feminism: joylessness, sexlessness, uptightness.\u201d</p> <p>Nothing embodies these stereotypes more than the monumental, dungareed figure of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/apr/16/why-andrea-dworkin-is-the-radical-visionary-feminist-we-need-in-our-terrible-times\" title=\"\">Andrea Dworkin</a>, whose alliance with the religious right over the censorship of pornography dealt radical feminism a body blow. Now she too has been brought back into circulation with the timely publication of <em>Last Days at Hot Slit</em>, a selection of her writings that makes a powerful case for her complexity, wit, stylistic originality and political relevance in the grab-\u2019em-by-the-pussy era. Donald Trump, Harvey Weinstein: none of it would have surprised Dworkin. \u201cOur enemies \u2013 rapists and their defenders \u2013 not only go unpunished; they remain influential arbiters of morality; they have high and esteemed places in society; they are priests, lawyers, judges, lawmakers, politicians, doctors, artists.\u201d</p> <p>The body\u2019s situation was her prime territory. Her first husband battered her nearly to death before she escaped him, and her experience of being \u201cjust some bleeding thing cut up on the floor\u201d drove all her work. How do you convey the systemisation of violence against women when there is a conspiracy of silence around it, when it is so tolerated and disseminated and sustained as to have merged with the fabric of ordinary reality?</p> <p>Dworkin\u2019s decision, and the reason her writing remains so pungent and uncanny, was to amplify. To go hard. To find a language \u201cmore terrifying than rape, more abject than torture, more insistent and destabilising than battery, more desolate than prostitution, more invasive than incest, more filled with threat and aggression than pornography\u201d. Though there\u2019s plenty of material here that\u2019s dated, hyperbolic or plain wrong-headed (like Johanna Fateman, the co-editor of this collection, I\u2019ve often occupied the opposite position to Dworkin, particularly on issues of censorship and sexual freedom), her arguments are more nuanced than the caricatures perpetuated today. Then there\u2019s her weird, electric style. \u201cI want his boot off my neck.\u201d \u201cCarnivorous in its use of women.\u201d \u201cThere are no innocent bystanders.\u201d She wrote in 1995: \u201cI have always loved the writing that takes one deep, no matter how strange or bitter or dirty the descent.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ec1f1386f5860de9d6ebdddefd4cc7eb9539c580\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec1f1386f5860de9d6ebdddefd4cc7eb9539c580/0_99_2051_1231/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrea Dworkin in 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I have always loved the writing that takes one deep, no matter how strange or bitter or dirty the descent.\u2019 Andrea Dworkin in 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colin McPherson/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her own eyes had been opened by the publication in 1970 of Kate Millett\u2019s <em>Sexual Politics</em>, a revolutionary analysis of sexual dynamics in literature, which painstakingly revealed that the superstructure of patriarchy was by no means confined to economics or the law, but permeated to the furthest reaches of the culture, infiltrating and informing the domestic and erotic. Nearly 50 years on, it\u2019s both gratifying and troubling that the same technique is still in use, deployed liberally by Steinke and Angel in books that have returned to the contested ground, if not the tone, of radical feminism. Angel assesses fathers in Sally Potter\u2019s film <em>Ginger </em><em>&amp; Ros</em><em>a</em>, Radio 4\u2019s <em>The Archers</em> and Sarah Moss\u2019s <em>Ghost Wall</em>: narcissistic, self-involved, violently possessive. Both Steinke and Dworkin linger over <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jul/25/fiction.features3\" title=\"\">The Story of O</a></em>, Dworkin as evidence that men regard women primarily as a zero, a hole \u2013 Steinke in regretful post-post-feminist reverie about the erotic charge that submitting to this particular fantasy of abasement could induce.</p> <p>Patriarchy is a totalitarian system. How do you dodge conscription, or evade its all-seeing gaze? Angel, encountering Anthea Hamilton\u2019s exhibition <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/21/anthea-hamilton-review-the-squash-duveen-commission-tate-britain\" title=\"\">The Squash</a></em> at Tate Britain, takes pleasure in the \u201cdeliciously genderless\u201d nature of the creature \u2013 the performer in the squash-like costume. It has no eyes, or even a true face, but the \u201cbeautiful, bulbous, obscene\u201d head nevertheless seems to turn and take her in. What a relief to have an encounter in which gender plays no part. On a whale-watching trip, Steinke likewise experiences a \u201cdilation\u201d of her sense of self when she\u2019s miraculously eyed by Granny, the post-reproductive matriarch who leads three pods of killer whales in the Pacific.</p> <p>Animals are a way of thinking about the \u201cthingness\u201d of bodily existence without getting tangled up in the situations of human politics and culture. Androgyny, too, offers a way of refusing assigned and harmful gender roles. Catching a glimpse of herself in a window, Steinke first sees an old man and relishes the ungendering of age, the falling away of her visual identity as a woman. Reading trans memoirs by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/dec/06/juliet-jacques-trans-a-memoir\" title=\"\">Juliet Jacques</a> and Max Wolf Valerio, she luxuriates in a sense of gender as fluid, a hormonal tide between two poles, along which we all bob and drift, sometimes making drastic crossings and sometimes remaining tethered in place (being a white, cis, middle-class woman no doubt makes those crossings more alluring and less perilous than they actually are). Dworkin, too, advocates the destruction of the essentialist gender binary, writing in a utopian flourish: \u201cAndrogyny \u2026 may be the one road to freedom open to women, men, and that emerging majority, the rest of us.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Both Dworkin and Steinke fret over their mothers, the enforcers of impossible standards of beauty and behaviour</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The family tends to be where gender roles are inculcated and maintained, and both Dworkin and Steinke fret in particular over their mothers, the enforcers of impossible standards of beauty and behaviour. Dworkin\u2019s mother, Sylvia, could not brook conflict and regarded independent thought as sinister revolt. Dworkin believed that stopping loving her was among the greatest achievements of her life. Steinke, awake night after night in the furnace of flushes, goes to work on the memory of her dead mother like a burying beetle. She remembers that on their final evening together, her mother pulled out a picture of Steinke aged 49, getting married for the second time. She wore a pink dress, and, though underneath she had on a thick beige bodysuit and control-top tights, her mother swears that in the photograph her pubic hair is showing. Shame: passed between women down generations, a technique of control that brings no more pleasure to the enforcer than the recipient.</p> <p>These stories matter, both to the individual who experienced them and as cultural tendencies, but I can\u2019t help wondering whether the logic of exposure might not be quite as powerful as Dworkin hoped back in 1973, the year her first book, <em>Woman Hating</em>, was published. What is the point of revealing the embedded presence of patriarchal ideology (another lost word) in books and family histories when an undisguised misogynist is the president of the US, and abortion rights, one of the first victories of second-wave feminism, are being obliterated? As Angel says, the telling of stories held so dear by the #MeToo movement, the desire to call out injustice, might actually reinforce what it seeks to pull down, since \u201cthe evidence of swaggering cruelty may both gratify and solidify the fantasy of dominance\u201d.</p> <p>This doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no point in writing. Writing the self, Angel observes, is not just to do with catharsis or narcissistic revelation. It\u2019s a route towards individuation: the process of encapsulating what the self is, and of expelling what it\u2019s not. Drawing on Jacques Lacan and on Donald Winnicott (whose relative freedom from misogyny has made him a linchpin in contemporary autotheory, from Alison Bechdel\u2019s <em>Are You My Mother</em> to Maggie Nelson\u2019s <em>The Argonauts</em>), she describes the mirror stage of psychoanalysis, the process by which the infant gains a sense of itself as separate through the mirror of the parent\u2019s gaze. If the child is rejected, if their affection is coerced, if their aggression is forbidden, then the child will be trapped in a false self. But if the parent can withstand the child\u2019s aggression and remain undestroyed, then the infant will have the immeasurable gift of feeling real. Not everyone will achieve this in childhood, but the work of writing offers a second chance.</p> <p>Maybe feeling real sounds like a luxury. It\u2019s not. As a battered wife, Dworkin was hit with an iron bar, burned with cigarettes, punched in the breasts, her head smashed repeatedly into a concrete floor, but the worst thing she experienced was the isolation of being disbelieved, of being unable to convince anyone \u2013 friends, family, neighbours, police, doctors \u2013 to help. That was the nadir: \u201cthe pure and consuming madness of being invisible and unreal\u201d.</p> <p>In the activist tradition from which Dworkin hails, writing an experience down is a way of reclaiming reality. Making something visible \u2013 rape, domestic violence, racism, misogyny \u2013 is the precursor to action, since if these things cannot be seen and, crucially, realised as shared, communal, and therefore political, then they are not available for transformation. Writing is the first step to political change. \u201cI want writers to write books as actions,\u201d she declared in <em>Woman Hating</em>. A generation on, Steinke too explicitly frames writing as resistance: \u201cI wanted to fight back, resist how the culture stigmatises and denigrates menopausal women.\u201d</p> <p>If hope of change is what drove Dworkin\u2019s crusade, one of the most distressing aspects of <em>Hot Slit</em> is how she came to lose her faith. She had been raped many times. For a decade she gave a speech called \u201cRape Atrocity\u201d, and for a decade women came up to her afterwards and told her what had happened to them: in an alley, asleep in bed, in a factory, a stockroom, a school, until she could no longer bear it and stopped giving the speech. And then in 1999, at the age of 52, she was raped again in a hotel room in Paris, only this time a date-rape drug was used and she had no recollection of the attack, just artefacts: a bruise on her breast, a bloody gouge on her thigh.

      "bodyText": "Among the epigraphs in Flash Count Diary, Darcey Steinke\u2019s incandescent account of the menopause, is a line from The Second Sex by Simone de Beauvoir: \u201cThe body is not a thing but a situation.\u201d Steinke is being assailed, even menaced by hot flushes. They come with a warning: first an aura, a vertigo-inducing plunge into anxiety, then an explosion of heat. They hit her at work, in bed, bringing insomnia and depression in their wake. They can be generated by the smallest shift in temperature \u2013 a plate of scrambled eggs placed too close to her stomach, the door closing on a bus. Lying on her sofa in Brooklyn, \u201ca slab of frozen ham balanced on my forehead\u201d, she recognises that she has become the butt of a cultural joke: the menopausal woman, out of oestrogen, evolutionary roadkill. In Feminine Forever, the 1966 book that kickstarted the popularity of HRT, she finds post-menopausal women described as \u201ccastrates\u201d with pathologically dry vaginas. Half a century on, not much has changed. At the 11th European Conference on Menopause and Andropause in Amsterdam, she watches a video about laser treatment to sandblast the menopausal vagina, accompanied by an animation that shows a withered brown rose transform into a tight pink bud. As an Italian doctor dismisses a nurse\u2019s concerns about the breast cancer risk of HRT, she realises \u201call his descriptions explain how the vagina might feel to an incoming penis\u201d. Is the problem really her body, this ageing animal thing, or a cultural situation that insists women\u2019s value is predominantly sexual or reproductive? And what is the word for this situation? Could it be patriarchy? Patriarchy as a concept was long out of fashion. As Katherine Angel explains in Daddy Issues, her smart, thoughtful essay about the cultural place of fathers in the #MeToo age, it was sunk alongside the corpse of second-wave feminism. \u201cThe nineties \u2013 decade of girl power, and of an insistence on women\u2019s economic and social freedom, on the condition that women themselves abandon a critique of gender relations \u2013 gave invocations of patriarchy, as it gave feminism, a fusty feel, an old-fashioned whiff, conjuring all the age-old stereotypes of feminism: joylessness, sexlessness, uptightness.\u201d Nothing embodies these stereotypes more than the monumental, dungareed figure of Andrea Dworkin, whose alliance with the religious right over the censorship of pornography dealt radical feminism a body blow. Now she too has been brought back into circulation with the timely publication of Last Days at Hot Slit, a selection of her writings that makes a powerful case for her complexity, wit, stylistic originality and political relevance in the grab-\u2019em-by-the-pussy era. Donald Trump, Harvey Weinstein: none of it would have surprised Dworkin. \u201cOur enemies \u2013 rapists and their defenders \u2013 not only go unpunished; they remain influential arbiters of morality; they have high and esteemed places in society; they are priests, lawyers, judges, lawmakers, politicians, doctors, artists.\u201d The body\u2019s situation was her prime territory. Her first husband battered her nearly to death before she escaped him, and her experience of being \u201cjust some bleeding thing cut up on the floor\u201d drove all her work. How do you convey the systemisation of violence against women when there is a conspiracy of silence around it, when it is so tolerated and disseminated and sustained as to have merged with the fabric of ordinary reality? Dworkin\u2019s decision, and the reason her writing remains so pungent and uncanny, was to amplify. To go hard. To find a language \u201cmore terrifying than rape, more abject than torture, more insistent and destabilising than battery, more desolate than prostitution, more invasive than incest, more filled with threat and aggression than pornography\u201d. Though there\u2019s plenty of material here that\u2019s dated, hyperbolic or plain wrong-headed (like Johanna Fateman, the co-editor of this collection, I\u2019ve often occupied the opposite position to Dworkin, particularly on issues of censorship and sexual freedom), her arguments are more nuanced than the caricatures perpetuated today. Then there\u2019s her weird, electric style. \u201cI want his boot off my neck.\u201d \u201cCarnivorous in its use of women.\u201d \u201cThere are no innocent bystanders.\u201d She wrote in 1995: \u201cI have always loved the writing that takes one deep, no matter how strange or bitter or dirty the descent.\u201d Her own eyes had been opened by the publication in 1970 of Kate Millett\u2019s Sexual Politics, a revolutionary analysis of sexual dynamics in literature, which painstakingly revealed that the superstructure of patriarchy was by no means confined to economics or the law, but permeated to the furthest reaches of the culture, infiltrating and informing the domestic and erotic. Nearly 50 years on, it\u2019s both gratifying and troubling that the same technique is still in use, deployed liberally by Steinke and Angel in books that have returned to the contested ground, if not the tone, of radical feminism. Angel assesses fathers in Sally Potter\u2019s film Ginger &amp; Rosa, Radio 4\u2019s The Archers and Sarah Moss\u2019s Ghost Wall: narcissistic, self-involved, violently possessive. Both Steinke and Dworkin linger over The Story of O, Dworkin as evidence that men regard women primarily as a zero, a hole \u2013 Steinke in regretful post-post-feminist reverie about the erotic charge that submitting to this particular fantasy of abasement could induce. Patriarchy is a totalitarian system. How do you dodge conscription, or evade its all-seeing gaze? Angel, encountering Anthea Hamilton\u2019s exhibition The Squash at Tate Britain, takes pleasure in the \u201cdeliciously genderless\u201d nature of the creature \u2013 the performer in the squash-like costume. It has no eyes, or even a true face, but the \u201cbeautiful, bulbous, obscene\u201d head nevertheless seems to turn and take her in. What a relief to have an encounter in which gender plays no part. On a whale-watching trip, Steinke likewise experiences a \u201cdilation\u201d of her sense of self when she\u2019s miraculously eyed by Granny, the post-reproductive matriarch who leads three pods of killer whales in the Pacific. Animals are a way of thinking about the \u201cthingness\u201d of bodily existence without getting tangled up in the situations of human politics and culture. Androgyny, too, offers a way of refusing assigned and harmful gender roles. Catching a glimpse of herself in a window, Steinke first sees an old man and relishes the ungendering of age, the falling away of her visual identity as a woman. Reading trans memoirs by Juliet Jacques and Max Wolf Valerio, she luxuriates in a sense of gender as fluid, a hormonal tide between two poles, along which we all bob and drift, sometimes making drastic crossings and sometimes remaining tethered in place (being a white, cis, middle-class woman no doubt makes those crossings more alluring and less perilous than they actually are). Dworkin, too, advocates the destruction of the essentialist gender binary, writing in a utopian flourish: \u201cAndrogyny \u2026 may be the one road to freedom open to women, men, and that emerging majority, the rest of us.\u201d The family tends to be where gender roles are inculcated and maintained, and both Dworkin and Steinke fret in particular over their mothers, the enforcers of impossible standards of beauty and behaviour. Dworkin\u2019s mother, Sylvia, could not brook conflict and regarded independent thought as sinister revolt. Dworkin believed that stopping loving her was among the greatest achievements of her life. Steinke, awake night after night in the furnace of flushes, goes to work on the memory of her dead mother like a burying beetle. She remembers that on their final evening together, her mother pulled out a picture of Steinke aged 49, getting married for the second time. She wore a pink dress, and, though underneath she had on a thick beige bodysuit and control-top tights, her mother swears that in the photograph her pubic hair is showing. Shame: passed between women down generations, a technique of control that brings no more pleasure to the enforcer than the recipient. These stories matter, both to the individual who experienced them and as cultural tendencies, but I can\u2019t help wondering whether the logic of exposure might not be quite as powerful as Dworkin hoped back in 1973, the year her first book, Woman Hating, was published. What is the point of revealing the embedded presence of patriarchal ideology (another lost word) in books and family histories when an undisguised misogynist is the president of the US, and abortion rights, one of the first victories of second-wave feminism, are being obliterated? As Angel says, the telling of stories held so dear by the #MeToo movement, the desire to call out injustice, might actually reinforce what it seeks to pull down, since \u201cthe evidence of swaggering cruelty may both gratify and solidify the fantasy of dominance\u201d. This doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no point in writing. Writing the self, Angel observes, is not just to do with catharsis or narcissistic revelation. It\u2019s a route towards individuation: the process of encapsulating what the self is, and of expelling what it\u2019s not. Drawing on Jacques Lacan and on Donald Winnicott (whose relative freedom from misogyny has made him a linchpin in contemporary autotheory, from Alison Bechdel\u2019s Are You My Mother to Maggie Nelson\u2019s The Argonauts), she describes the mirror stage of psychoanalysis, the process by which the infant gains a sense of itself as separate through the mirror of the parent\u2019s gaze. If the child is rejected, if their affection is coerced, if their aggression is forbidden, then the child will be trapped in a false self. But if the parent can withstand the child\u2019s aggression and remain undestroyed, then the infant will have the immeasurable gift of feeling real. Not everyone will achieve this in childhood, but the work of writing offers a second chance. Maybe feeling real sounds like a luxury. It\u2019s not. As a battered wife, Dworkin was hit with an iron bar, burned with cigarettes, punched in the breasts, her head smashed repeatedly into a concrete floor, but the worst thing she experienced was the isolation of being disbelieved, of being unable to convince anyone \u2013 friends, family, neighbours, police, doctors \u2013 to help. That was the nadir: \u201cthe pure and consuming madness of being invisible and unreal\u201d. In the activist tradition from which Dworkin hails, writing an experience down is a way of reclaiming reality. Making something visible \u2013 rape, domestic violence, racism, misogyny \u2013 is the precursor to action, since if these things cannot be seen and, crucially, realised as shared, communal, and therefore political, then they are not available for transformation.

Researchers from Purdue University in Indiana spent six months trying to eradicate German cockroaches (Blattella germanica L.), one of the most common species of household cockroach in the US, Australia and Europe, from three low-rise apartment buildings in Illinois and Indiana. The results were published in Scientific Reports last month. The study used three different professional-grade pesticide mixes: a rotation of three different insecticides, changing every month for six months; a mix of two insecticides sprayed monthly; and abamectin gel baits applied once a month in an area where the cockroaches had been tested and showed a low resistance to abamectin. Of the three, only the abamectin gel baits succeeded in reducing the cockroach population, and then only in populations which had a low-resistance. In another area where 10% of the cockroach population was resistant to the chemical, populations grew. Cockroach populations in the building treated with three rotating pesticides remained flat, and populations in the building treated with the mixed spray \u201cflourished\u201d. Populations were surveyed using glue traps before testing began and once a month thereafter, just before the next round of pesticide treatment. \u201cIf you have the ability to test the roaches first and pick an insecticide that has low resistance, that ups the odds,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author Michael Scharf said in a press statement from the university. \u201cBut even then, we had trouble controlling populations.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Subsequent laboratory tests showed that cockroaches were able to develop a \u201ccross resistance\u201d to multiple types of pesticide, meaning that those which survived the spraying would go on to survive other eradication attempts even if a different class of pesticide was used. Previously, it was believed that cockroaches only developed a resistance to one class of pesticide following exposure. \u201cWe would see resistance increase four- or six-fold in just one generation,\u201d Scharf said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a clue that something like that could happen this fast.\u201d Rapid breeding rates \u2013 a female German cockroach can have 50 offspring every three months, expanding out to up to 10 million descendants over four generations within 12 months \u2013 mean that chemical pesticides can swiftly become ineffective. \u201cCockroaches developing resistance to multiple classes of insecticides at once will make controlling these pests almost impossible with chemicals alone,\u201d Scharf said. He said pest controllers would have to use a mix of traps, improved sanitation in housing developments, and bug vacuums to reduce cockroach numbers.",

People in Tassie are doing it tough and for them $1k in their back pocket now will give them some immediate relief. But there are thousands of Tasmanians who are on the pension, Newstart and don\u2019t earn enough money to pay tax, and they don\u2019t see any benefit from a tax cut.</p> <p>Tasmanian families are sleeping in cars, parks and tents \u2013 all in the dead of winter. Three thousand Tasmanians are on the housing waiting list. The state of Tasmania owes the federal government $157m in social housing debt. Tasmania is paying 50c in every dollar of our state housing budget back to the federal government in interest and debt repayments. That means we are building half as many homes, helping half as many people. This at a time when the Tasmanian treasurer is spruiking Tasmania\u2019s \u201cgolden age\u201d.</p> <p>This debt is holding Tasmania back and denying shelter to thousands of Tasmanian families. The commonwealth coffers don\u2019t need $15m a year from the Tasmanian budget. We\u2019ve got families living in cars who need a roof and a meal, and they\u2019re the ones I\u2019m thinking about.</p> <p>The state Liberal government keeps talking a big game but they haven\u2019t achieved anything in debt relief. At this rate we\u2019ll be paying this debt for another 23 years. This time last year Tasmanian families were living in tents in the showground \u2013 it\u2019s a year later and the situation has only got worse. They need help now, not in 2042.</p> <p>It\u2019s only by having the balance of power for Tasmania in the Senate that real debt relief is going to happen and that\u2019s what I am here to fight for. There is no way in good conscience I can vote for substantial tax cuts without making sure that the people who so desperately need a roof over their heads aren\u2019t left to go without.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t going to fix every problem in Tasmania, but it\u2019s a start. It would free up enough money to find a home for 3,000 people on the critical list through accommodation and casework.</p> <p>The government doesn\u2019t want to admit it, but the economy in rural and regional areas is flagging. We\u2019ve got businesses struggling to the point of closure and they\u2019re desperate to see some sort of stimulus happen now, not in the never-never. I\u2019m here to use the balance of power for them, and to make sure that we don\u2019t let people in rural and regional areas continue to slip through the cracks.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-03T05:03:00.116Z\">at 6.03am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d1c32308f087f38aa1f3c65\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-03T04:43:33.727Z\">5.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Earlier this morning, <strong>Laura Jayes</strong> from Sky asked <strong>Ed Husic</strong> about the Quran he took his oath of office on yesterday.

But here was the chat:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>FK: </strong>OK just finally and when <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> meets with <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> today, one of the things they\u2019re going to be talking about is the Religious Discrimination Bill, which we could see as early as this month. We understand the prime minister\u2019s keen for bipartisan support on this. Will Labor back the bill if it goes further than simply including religion as one of the allowable attributes under anti-discrimination law? Will you back it if religion protections are kept to a minimum? What\u2019s Labor\u2019s red line here?</p> <p><strong>KK</strong><strong>:</strong> Well the Labor party under the leadership of Anthony Albanese has made clear that we are willing to have discussions with the government and to work with the government on a religious discrimination and religious freedom act. We are waiting to have those conversations. We do stand ready though to work with the government on this.</p> <p><strong> FK: </strong>On what, to what level though? I mean, do you personally, do you think churches and religious organisations deserve specific protections, rather than exemptions from the current law that allow them for instance to discriminate in the name of their faith?

We\u2019ve shifted our position. We\u2019ve said we\u2019re prepared to cop stage two. We\u2019ve got a better way to deliver it sooner. The government, remarkably, voted against their own tax cuts being delivered sooner. The so-called \u201cparty of lower taxes\u201d voted against a tax cut this year because they\u2019ve put a higher premium on tax cuts in five years than tax cuts this week. </p> <p>But the point that I wanted to make, Sabra, is our position is guided by boosting the economy, by giving every Australian worker a tax cut in this term of the parliament. </p> <p>But thirdly, not saddling the budget with stage three of the tax cuts, which is a $95bn cost to the economy, which doesn\u2019t come in for another five years. This is a government which hasn\u2019t got the economy right at any turn now pretending that they know what the budget and the economy will look like in five years\u2019 time. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s responsible.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-02T23:34:49.054Z\">at 12.34am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d1be4048f082cc21811c52c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-02T23:16:09.221Z\">12.16am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Meanwhile, back in the real world, confidence in the economy is not fantastic. The RBA has made as much of a plea as it can for the government to kickstart spending. From <strong>Philip Lowe:</strong><br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is important to think about the task ahead holistically. Monetary policy does have a significant role to play and our actions are helping to support the Australian economy, but we should not rely on monetary policy alone. We will achieve better outcomes if the various arms of public policy are all pointing in the same direction.</p> </blockquote> <p>That is as much of FRICKING DO SOMETHING as the very dry RBA governor can make. A big part of the problem? Stagnant wage growth. We know that people on low and middle incomes tend to spend their money. If they are trying to hold on to as much of their income as possible, it\u2019s because they can\u2019t afford to live, so they make choices. Foregoing discretionary spending is one of the first moves. We also know that Newstart hasn\u2019t shifted in real terms for more than two decades. The business community wants Newstart increased because not only can people not afford to look for work on the allowance, they can\u2019t afford to live. That\u2019s not necessarily altruistic \u2013 business knows that any increase in Newstart will be spent. And that\u2019s what capitalism relies on.</p> <p>Higher income earners, though, they don\u2019t tend to spend their increases. They save it. Because they can. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-02T23:35:16.611Z\">at 12.35am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d1be0ea8f088a7392737c59\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-02T23:04:41.312Z\">12.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>You may have seen we posted the list of legislation for the next few sittings.</p> <p>You may have also noticed some of the parenthesis legislation names.

The government\u2019s tax plan was first off the bat but press freedom also got a guernsey.</p> <p>Labor voted to pass the tax cuts through the House \u2013 not that it matters from a numbers point of view, as the government has a majority. But it matters from the optics. All eyes are on Labor, because the tax plan \u2013 particularly tranche three \u2013 stands against everything the opposition has been building its policy platform on for the past six years. If it decides to pass the whole package in the Senate, that\u2019s a signal that things are about to change for the party.</p> <p>But first, Labor will attempt to have its amendments to the bill passed in the Senate. It wants the already legislated stage two to come into effect earlier, and the third tranche of this package delayed. The government says no, and looks to have the necessary crossbench support to get it across the line \u2013 so watch this space.</p> <p>Meanwhile, about an hour after <strong>Kristina Keneally</strong> announced Labor\u2019s plan to hold an inquiry into press freedom, the government announced it too was looking at an inquiry into press freedom.</p> <p>Whether there are two inquiries (and at this stage, that is a possibility) will depend on what is in the government\u2019s suggestion \u2013 and whether or not whistleblowers are also included.</p> <p><strong>Peter Dutton </strong>meanwhile, wants to bring in laws to ban Australians involved in terrorism activities overseas from returning for at least two years. They\u2019re based on similar UK laws but the joint intelligence committee which looked at the issue last year \u2013 and is led by the Liberal <strong>Andrew Hastie</strong> \u2013 had some concerns about the laws, particularly the lack of judicial oversight. In the UK, a judge signs off on the order, while in Australia it was to be the minister. Still, the government will push forward \u2013 we will wait to see if it responds to the joint intelligence committee\u2019s recommendations.</p> <p>So a big day. But most of that will be happening behind the scenes, with the official parts of the day taken up by condolence motions for<strong> Bob Hawke</strong>. So no debate until tomorrow.</p> <p>We\u2019ll bring you everything that happens, as it does. <strong>Mike Bowers</strong> was here late last night, so I\u2019ll bring you some of what he shot. The Guardian brains trust is on the job. I need another coffee, quite desperately. </p> <p>Ready?</p> <p>Let\u2019s get into it. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-02T22:39:32.925Z\">at 11.39pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "With the condolence motions rolling on, and everyone gearing up for the first real day of sitting tomorrow, we are going to bring the blog to a close. It will be my last early mark for sometime, so I am going to seize it while I can. But tomorrow, we\u2019ll be back to usual blog speed, as we see what the 46th parliament is going to be like for the very first time. First proper debate. First question time. First actual parliamenting. Thanks for following along with us so far this week. It has been a strange week \u2013 well, stranger than usual. Mike Bowers, the Guardian brainstrust and I will all be back early tomorrow morning. I hope you can enjoy your own early mark. And please \u2013 take care of you. If you hear about leadership rumblings within the Greens in the next few days, it is because cartoonist Jon Kudelka got bored on social media, and the joke seemingly hasn\u2019t translated correctly to the real world. I am assured that the Greens, who just elected their leadership, are doing fine. The party is talking to its membership about future leader ballots, but it is not on. This has been a public service, so people will stop messaging me about it. Jacqui Lambie\u2019s statement would point to the government having the tax cut deal all but stitched up. But all of it will be happening tomorrow. The condolence motions are still being delivered in the House of Representatives. It will adjourn at the conclusion of the last speech, just like the Senate. Looking at that statement, it looks like one of Jacqui Lambie\u2019s demands will be the federal government waiving Tasmania\u2019s social housing debt. Verrry interesting. Talks were had on that front quite recently, but there was no final solution offered up. Perhaps, there will be one now. Jacqui Lambie has released a statement on the tax cut package. She is yet to arrive at a final decision: I was elected by the people of Australia, I work for them and it is to them that I answer. I am yet to arrive at a final position on the Coalition\u2019s tax cuts. People in Tassie are doing it tough and for them $1k in their back pocket now will give them some immediate relief. But there are thousands of Tasmanians who are on the pension, Newstart and don\u2019t earn enough money to pay tax, and they don\u2019t see any benefit from a tax cut. Tasmanian families are sleeping in cars, parks and tents \u2013 all in the dead of winter. Three thousand Tasmanians are on the housing waiting list. The state of Tasmania owes the federal government $157m in social housing debt. Tasmania is paying 50c in every dollar of our state housing budget back to the federal government in interest and debt repayments. That means we are building half as many homes, helping half as many people. This at a time when the Tasmanian treasurer is spruiking Tasmania\u2019s \u201cgolden age\u201d. This debt is holding Tasmania back and denying shelter to thousands of Tasmanian families. The commonwealth coffers don\u2019t need $15m a year from the Tasmanian budget. We\u2019ve got families living in cars who need a roof and a meal, and they\u2019re the ones I\u2019m thinking about. The state Liberal government keeps talking a big game but they haven\u2019t achieved anything in debt relief. At this rate we\u2019ll be paying this debt for another 23 years. This time last year Tasmanian families were living in tents in the showground \u2013 it\u2019s a year later and the situation has only got worse. They need help now, not in 2042. It\u2019s only by having the balance of power for Tasmania in the Senate that real debt relief is going to happen and that\u2019s what I am here to fight for. There is no way in good conscience I can vote for substantial tax cuts without making sure that the people who so desperately need a roof over their heads aren\u2019t left to go without. This isn\u2019t going to fix every problem in Tasmania, but it\u2019s a start. It would free up enough money to find a home for 3,000 people on the critical list through accommodation and casework. The government doesn\u2019t want to admit it, but the economy in rural and regional areas is flagging. We\u2019ve got businesses struggling to the point of closure and they\u2019re desperate to see some sort of stimulus happen now, not in the never-never. I\u2019m here to use the balance of power for them, and to make sure that we don\u2019t let people in rural and regional areas continue to slip through the cracks. Earlier this morning, Laura Jayes from Sky asked Ed Husic about the Quran he took his oath of office on yesterday. It\u2019s a lovely story, if you haven\u2019t heard it: Well I visited Farid Ahmed, who lost his wife back in March [in the Christchurch massacre]. He had been in the mosque, consoling someone who was just diagnosed with cancer and she had gone and saved a number of people and made sure that they got off to safety. And then she went back in to save Farid because he is wheelchair-bound and the gunman got her. A bloke like that, you would understand would feel a range of emotions and be really worked up about it and he took the view, \u2018no I am going to forgive\u2019, which he said publicly straight after and he has dedicated himself to bringing communities together. I was very grateful he loaned me his family\u2019s copy of the Quran and I took my parliamentary oath on that and I just figure given how close our countries are and given the way that Farid has dedicated himself to better, stronger communities and I am more than happy to stand with a person like that. Acoss is making a last-ditch bid to convince the crossbench, and Labor, not to pass the third tranche of the tax plan: The government is asking the parliament to lock in tax cuts costing $36bn a year three to five years in advance, without knowing how the budget and the economy will then be faring,\u201d Jacqueline Phillips said. \u201cThese expensive, high-end tax cuts will deprive future governments of the revenue it needs to guarantee essential services like health, education and social security. \u201cThis is not a decision that can be rushed and at the very least the stage 2 and 3 tax cuts should go to a Senate inquiry. Stage 1 (due this year) can be passed separately and the other stages would not come into effect for at least three years.\u201d The Senate has adjourned as a mark of respect for Bob Hawke. Normal proceedings \u2013 including the first debates and question time \u2013 will resume tomorrow. My bet? End of the year. The spot would most likely go back to the Liberal party. The Nationals whip, the new senator Perin Davey, had a chat to the ABC about the tax debate tomorrow: We are all prepared to sit for as long as it takes, because getting the tax package through is the priority of government, it\u2019s what the Australian people voted for, so as a Senate we are prepared to do what it takes, but what happened in the House of Representatives was very positive, getting it through, so we hope that it\u2019s the way it pans out and plays out in the Senate, and that would be a very positive thing for all of us to move into the next parliament. How long the Senate sits of course is not a decision for the government \u2013 it is a decision for the Senate to extend sitting hours. Given some of the interest of this I have seen on social media, I thought I would post the conversation Fran Kelly and Kristina Keneally had on the religious freedom inquiry. This isn\u2019t a new position for today \u2013 Labor has said it is open to look at it. But here was the chat: FK: OK just finally and when Anthony Albanese meets with Scott Morrison today, one of the things they\u2019re going to be talking about is the Religious Discrimination Bill, which we could see as early as this month. We understand the prime minister\u2019s keen for bipartisan support on this. Will Labor back the bill if it goes further than simply including religion as one of the allowable attributes under anti-discrimination law? Will you back it if religion protections are kept to a minimum? What\u2019s Labor\u2019s red line here? KK: Well the Labor party under the leadership of Anthony Albanese has made clear that we are willing to have discussions with the government and to work with the government on a religious discrimination and religious freedom act. We are waiting to have those conversations. We do stand ready though to work with the government on this. FK: On what, to what level though? I mean, do you personally, do you think churches and religious organisations deserve specific protections, rather than exemptions from the current law that allow them for instance to discriminate in the name of their faith? The obvious example is schools and not being able to hire or being able to fire employees who are gay for instance. KK: Well, Labor in fact in the last term of parliament put forward legislation that made clear that we do support the right of religious schools to be able to require staff and teachers to act in ways that, in their professional capacity, that uphold the values and the ethos of the institution, the religious faith, in which that school operates. But this is an issue that is broader than that. What the government are talking about is an issue that goes to protecting religion in an affirmative way, as a freedom, and that is a conversation we are quite willing to have with the government. FK: And it\u2019s a conversation you think has some merit? KK: Well, given the\u2026 FK: Just briefly. KK: Given the conversations that we\u2019ve had over the past few weeks and, briefly, yes. This issue popped up a couple of weeks ago, but the second RBA cash rate cut in a row has brought it up again. Linda Burney has put out this statement: In light of yesterday\u2019s rate cut by the Reserve Bank, Labor is calling on the Liberals and Nationals to urgently reduce the deeming rates and ease the pressure on pensioner\u2019s budgets. The Reserve Bank has cut interest rates five times since 2015, with the cash rate now down to just 1 per cent. But the Liberals and Nationals have kept the deeming rates at up to 3.25 per cent. The deeming rates determine how much the Government assumes pensioners earn on their savings \u2013 and are used to calculate how much pension a person receives. Up to 627,000 age pensioners, who are on a part-pension because of the income test, are impacted by the Government\u2019s refusal to reduce deeming rates. The gap between interest rates and the deeming rates is growing \u2013 and the Liberals and Nationals are doing nothing about it. Scott Morrison is counting income many pensioners simply aren\u2019t getting. How does Scott Morrison expect pensioners to find term deposits or other secure investments that pay anything like 3.25 per cent? This is a double-whammy for pensioners. It means lower earnings on savings, and reduced pension payments. With interest rates at record lows \u2013 the Government has run out of excuses. Every day the Morrison Government refuses to reduce the deeming rates is another day they are short-changing pensioners. At this stage, the Senate looks like wrapping up just after 3. The House will go for longer, because there are more MPs. Bill Shorten delivered his speech to Bob Hawke. I\u2019ll bring you parts of it when I can. It would have been a bit of a surreal experience for him, I\u2019d imagine. This is an interesting press call: The National Farmers\u2019 Federation and the Rural Doctors Association of Australia ask the Government to explain the delay in implementing the ACCC\u2019s quad bike safety recommendations. If only there was a party dedicated to representing farmers and the concerns of regional and rural communities. It\u2019s been 50 years since man landed on the moon: Just back on the temporary exclusion laws Peter Dutton has been talking about, it might be worth pointing out that these \u2018urgent\u2019 laws have been legislated in the UK since 2015 \u2013 more than a year after the Coalition first came to power. Amber Rudd admitted in 2017 that the UK had only used the order once in that time, but the legislation existed. The joint intelligence committee returned its report and its recommendations in April this year. The government will decide if it adds the recommendations to the legislation. Labor remains in support of it, but wants to see if the recommendations are included as amendments to the bill. So yes, it has been \u2018fast tracked\u2019 and yes, we did see terror arrests yesterday and yes, there are reasons the government is talking about it now. But let\u2019s remember that the Coalition has been in power since 2013. This is not a first-term government. There have been opportunities for Dutton to have introduced this \u2018urgent\u2019 legislation previously. Just something to keep in mind. As always, it has been a very strange week \u2013 the first week of parliament is so heavy with pomp and tradition, it tends to weigh down everything around it. But the first question time is tomorrow. And it will be Anthony Albanese\u2019s first time in the opposition leader\u2019s chair, directing the questions. My guess? That it won\u2019t always be the prime minister in Labor\u2019s sights \u2013 if not tomorrow, then soon. There are quite a few people who don\u2019t like answering questions on that front bench, and what better way to bring that forward, than #theministerdidnotanswerthequestion time. Mike Bowers has been in both chambers, listening to the speeches in honour of Bob Hawke. He just compared it to the ones he heard when Gough Whitlam died, remembering that then, while there was a lot of tribute, there was also a \u201csting in the tail\u201d from the other side, with politicians talking about how he got them into politics because of how much they disliked his prime ministership. Bowers said he hasn\u2019t heard any of that today. It\u2019s partly because Hawke was beloved by the public, so they wouldn\u2019t take politicisation of the speeches (as Tony Abbott learned) but also because, well, a lot of what he and Paul Keating did is now so deeply ingrained as Australian \u2018never touch\u2019 policies, all sides now claim to support them. The meeting between Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese is also about finding areas of consensus, with reconciliation and religious freedoms high on the list, as well as the press and whistleblower freedom inquiry. Morrison really doesn\u2019t want a fight on religious freedoms \u2013 not only because of what will happen in the public debate, but because he doesn\u2019t want to reignite a war in his own party room. His election win has so far proclaimed peace in our times. But those issues still simmer under the surface, between liberals and conservatives. And of course, it is not as if the National party is one big happy family. While the Liberal party room may have lost some of its biggest disruptors at the last election, the Nationals did not. Just a little jump outside of modern politics for the moment \u2013 the high court will be asked for special leave to hear a case regarding the letters to the Queen from John Kerr over the Whitlam dismissal. So far, the letters have been kept private, but the historian Jenny Hocking has been fighting to make them public. If the high court says yes, this case will be Ah-MAZING. The Senate is also delivering condolence speeches for Bob Hawke. Richard Di Natale looked at whether or not, in today\u2019s political environment, \u201csomeone like Bob Hawke would be able to rise to the heights that he was able to\u201d considering his life before politics. He also looked at some of the decisions he made, comparing it to now: Some people have highlighted the parallels between the campaigns on the Franklin and, of course, the campaign that we\u2019re fighting today to stop the Adani coalmine from going ahead. If you look back on the Franklin River, it\u2019s true: there were divided views within all parties, voracious and greedy corporations desperate to see that project go ahead and a lot of local conservative politicians telling those out-of-towners to bugger off, but you had a growing grassroots environment movement committed to the preservation of Australia\u2019s precious places. What separates those issues is 35 years and the courage and leadership of Bob Hawke. The 1983 election that brought him to power saw all seats lost by Labor in Tassie, yet on the night of the election, after acknowledging his win and the hard work of his colleagues, the next people he acknowledged were Tasmanians. This is what he said to them: \u201cI want to give you, the people of Tasmania, the confidence that my government will be particularly concerned with the issues that were close to your mind when you cast your vote. \u201cMy government will go ahead and honour the promises that we\u2019ve made, but the dam will not go ahead \u2013 your concerns, legitimately, with issues of power and employment \u2013 and I\u2019ve made it clear that we\u2019ll meet your concerns. So, from this moment, I commit myself to an undertaking, a task, of national reconciliation. I ask that you give us your trust and cooperation and, if we work together, there will be no bounds as to what we can do together.\u201d He showed leadership; he sought to unite; he didn\u2019t equivocate; he worked hard to provide people with alternatives and he succeeded. It was Barry Jones, Bob Hawke\u2019s science minister, who told Fairfax that he\u2019d brooded a lot; about the likelihood of such interventions now. He said: \u201cIf there\u2019s a comparable situation to the Tasmanian dam dispute in 2019, would we act the same way that we did? I\u2019m not sure that we would.\u201d Interesting for anyone who is looking at the election result and trying to understand it: Niki Savva\u2019s book, Plots and Prayers, has the August leadership spill floating around the edges of this place once again. Particularly, Mathias Cormann\u2019s role in it. It\u2019s led to some uncomfortable conversations for the government\u2019s Senate leader. And questions he wants to continue to avoid. On Sky this morning, James Paterson took the whole \u2018he has my full confidence\u2019 cliche to a whole new level: \u201cWe would follow Mathias Cormann into a burning building if he asked us to,\u201d he said. Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese will meet very shortly to talk about the inquiry into press (and whistleblowers, which I would argue is just as if not more important) freedoms. The meeting is to see if the two parties can come to a consensus about what the inquiry should involve and who should take charge of it. Should the committee that ticked off on the national security laws look into the press and whistleblower freedoms that are being impinged because of those national security laws? Paul Fletcher told Fran Kelly this morning that yes, maybe it should: Well, the starting point, Fran, for any inquiry is the terms of reference and the terms of reference ask the committee to inquire and to report back on such things as the experiences of journalists and media organisations that have or could become subject to the powers of law enforcement or intelligence agencies and the impact of the exercise of those powers on journalists\u2019 work. So the key point here is what are the terms of reference for this committee in weighing up these matters and providing advice including, ultimately, to the parliament and to the government. So these terms of reference do go squarely to the issue which has generated a lot of commentary in recent weeks following the execution of those two search warrants by the AFP in early June, which is how do we strike this balance? When the AFP are going about their work \u2013 bearing in mind that they do that without reference to government, minister\u2019s aren\u2019t involved in these decisions \u2013 what are the factors that impact on that? What the committee\u2019s being asked to look at is what is that balance? And so the terms of reference are key and these terms of reference go squarely to the issues which have been the subject of a lot of commentary over recent weeks. The condolence motions will continue \u2013 but the tax debate continues to go on behind the scenes. But as far as the parliament is concerned, this is Bob\u2019s day. Anthony Albanese finishes the speech with Bob Hawke\u2019s impact on the Labor party: I must also say, on behalf of the Australian Labor party, that our party and our movement remembers our great fallen chief. He transformed Labor so that Labor could transform the nation. He took on internal fights and won them so that he could lead the nation. He taught us also how real reform occurs. You require successive victories. He was Australian Labor\u2019s greatest leader with four successive victories, which consolidated the reforms like Medicare and superannuation, so that they couldn\u2019t just be wound back easily. We know, of course, also that he never stopped singing Solidarity Forever. He particularly used to get to the line, \u201cIs there anything left to us but to organise and fight?\u201d The music is done now, in the quiet that is fallen we farewell this giant \u2013 a beloved Labor leader, our most popular prime minister. A man who, in so many ways, was Australia amplified. We farewell him, not with sadness, but with gratitude and with love. Our gratitude and love also go to his children, Susan, Steven and Roslyn, who had to share their dad with the nation, and to the memory of little Robert Jr, who, tragically, never got the chance. To Blanche, who was the great love of Bob and cared for him so compassionately during his later years. To the memory of Hazel Hawke, who was Bob\u2019s first great love. To the memory of Clem and Ellie Hawke who raised their son to turn his back on hatred and embrace the brotherhood and sisterhood of humanity. And finally, we turn to that driver outside the MCG that night, and we say, \u201cYou were right! Bob Hawke, legend!\u201d Albanese: During the decades after he left office, Australia\u2019s affection for him not only didn\u2019t dim, I think it actually grew. The year that he turned 80, Bob was walking out of MCG with delegates to the annual American-Australian Leadership Dialogue. A passing car slowed down. Its young driver yelled out, \u201cHawkey, you\u2019re a bloody legend.\u201d Bob\u2019s reply was both gracious and practical. \u201cWell, if I\u2019m such a bloody legend, why don\u2019t you give me a lift back to the pub.\u201d And with that, the former PM hopped into a car \u2013 no security, with perfect strangers \u2013 and sped off! One of the American delegates with their security was gobsmacked. That could never happen in America! And, indeed, it wouldn\u2019t. It is a perfect Australian story! I hope we never lose that character. Later that year, during his birthday celebrations, Bob stepped out on to the stage at the Sydney Opera House to conduct a number from Handel\u2019s Messiah. It was quite extraordinary when that was shown at the memorial service at the Sydney Opera House. One of the songs in Messiah includes the biblical line that had leapt out at Ellie a lifetime earlier \u2013 \u201cAnd the government shall be upon its shoulder\u201d \u2013 but fittingly it was the Hallelujah Chorus us that Bob conducted. Handel\u2019s joyous expression of a prophecy fulfilled. There was a lot of love in the room that day \u2013 a perfect snapshot of the long romance between one Australian and his compatriots. Today in the national parliament, we remember a genuinely national figure. Albanese: What can all of us here learn from Bob? Don\u2019t fear risk. Don\u2019t let the word \u201cno\u201d be your first instinct. Persuade people, bring them with you. Be among the people who chose you to represent them. Listen, engage. Stay true to your philosophies and make them the bedrock upon which you build your policies. You won\u2019t get agreement all the time, but you will get respect. Bob showed us the [rewards] of a political life lived that way. Albanese: When they were elected to office, three in every 10 Australians finished high school. When that period of government ended, the figure was eight out of 10 \u2013 a revolution in opportunity for young Australians. So many more young people also having the opportunity to attend university. The Antarctic, never to be militarised, never to be mined. In Tasmania, the Franklin River still flows wild and free. The Daintree in far north Queensland. Among the exploits on the world stage, Bob was the driving force between what South Africa\u2019s then finance minister described as \u201cthe dagger that finally immobilised apartheid\u201d. He drove that agenda on the global stage, and it was not a uniform agenda \u2013 far from it. It took courage. So that when Nelson Mandela arrived in Canberra, he said, \u201cI want you to know, Bob, that I am here in Canberra at this time because of you.\u201d Fighting that was just one of Bob\u2019s loathing for racism. He knew the strength in laying in unity, and he was always ready to fight those who sought to divide. When the dog whistle of racism was blown loudly, Bob responded in parliament with thunder. Last year, three decades later, almost to the day, parliament united right here around Bob\u2019s words, to condemn another politician who tried to divide us. That day in this place matched the vision Bob had for us. The prime minister shaking hands with the opposition leader. Muslim embracing Jew. All united in the knowledge that racism has no place among us. I spoke to Bob about that day. He was thrilled. Albanese: When Labor was swept to power in the first of his four election victories, Bob was blessed with a ministry of rare breadth, depth and talent. The political equivalent of a greatest hits collection. The Whitlam collection drove them into politics, but it was never going to steer them. This was no time for crash or crash through. Bob, Paul Keating his treasurer, and their team had a clear and urgent agenda to rescue Australia from what they saw as a state that they knew how to implement it, and how to sell it. Their energy was coupled with pragmatism. Their courage with intelligence. Their impatience with clear heads. They were united in the quest for an open and competitive and free society, and an intelligent, creative and benevolent society. They foresaw the rise of Australia and prepared Australia for it. They saw our future prosperity dependant on Australia becoming a confident, outward looking nation. They laid down the foundations of a robust, vibrant economy, that has repeatedly with stood forces which have felled other economies in our region and throughout the industrialised world. On to some of the achievements Apec, the floating of the dollar. Putting Australia in a position to benefit from global economic engagement. The Sex Discrimination Act. The affirmative action act. The return of Uluru, the physical heart of the nation, to its traditional owners. Universal superannuation. Landcare. Medicare. Albanese: Bob was a genuine folk figure long before he became the prime minister. He was, indeed, the first politician who built a reputation on TV before he became a parliamentarian. Once asked how he could simultaneously be president of the ACTU and president of the Australian Labor party, he replied with remarkable candour and typical Bob style. \u201cIf you can\u2019t ride two horses, you shouldn\u2019t be in the bloody circus!\u201d Now, doubt was not a regular visitor to Bob\u2019s mind. And he wasn\u2019t keen on it from others, but that doesn\u2019t mean that no one felt it. As a Hawke prime ministership grew ever more likely, some were worried. His talent and the sharpness of his economic mind were not questioned, but mightn\u2019t his larrikin streak embarrass us domestically and on the world stage? Never mind the future \u2013 what about the damaging revelations about his past? With the cheer of someone who once explained that he had credibility because he didn\u2019t exude morality, Bob pointed to his biography and said that there would be no shocks \u2013 it\u2019s all in the book! But the strength of personality sometimes masked his dedication to his work and to detail. The pay-off of habits formed in his long, hard years as an industrial advocate. All this energy was channelled into making life better for his fellow Australians. He was at once our leader and our cheerleader. He was ahead of us, calling us on, and yet somehow he was also walking alongside us, and for good measure giving us an encouraging push from behind. Bob was hardly a stranger to ambition, but his ambition embraced the rest of us. He knew we were capable of better, and he knew we could do it together. Think of some of his by-words that characterised his leadership. \u201cReconciliation, accord, consensus.\u201d They\u2019re all about us heading in one direction, as a nation, rather than division or conflict. And even though he was Labor to the core, you didn\u2019t have to vote for Bob to feel the love. He was no one-man band, of course. Anthony Albanese delivers the first speech for Labor. I thank the prime minister for his generous comments, not just today but at the memorial service at the Sydney Opera House, which was a remarkable event for an extraordinary Australian. I also welcome the announcement by the prime minister of the government\u2019s Bob Hawke scholarship foundation. It is, indeed, appropriate to recognise a young person and to give them support in Bob Hawke\u2019s name. Because Bob Hawke was always supportive of young people coming through. I first met him as the president of Young Labor, meeting with him about policy issue, that at the time Young Labor didn\u2019t always agree with Bob Hawke, it must be said! But he was always encouraging and he was a mentor and, indeed, a very dear friend, and he\u2019s missed on a personal level. Bob Hawke was the first prime minister in this new parliament. Close your eyes for a moment, and you can picture him by the despatch box \u2013 that famous cumulus of hair, the sparkle of his voice. He towered in this place with the confidence of a man who always felt destined for it. Bob had long known that he wanted to be the prime minister of Australia. More importantly, he knew that he would be \u2013 how could it be otherwise? Family legend always had it that when Bob\u2019s mother, Ellie, was pregnant with him, her bible fell open at Isiaah, chapter nine. \u201cFor unto us a child a born and the child is given, and the government shall be upon its shoulder.\u201d Between this early touch of Messiah and the clarifying effects of a near-death experience on his motorbike years later, Bob had a sense of destiny. Morrison finishes with this: Mr Speaker, on behalf of the government and indeed this parliament and the nation, I sincerely want to extend to Mr Hawke\u2019s widow, Blanche, and to his family, the deepest sympathies of our country, and we share and thank you for caring for Bob through the long sunset of his life. Again, today, as I did on the day that he passed, Jenny and I, particularly, want to acknowledge the support and contribution of the late and wonderful Hazel Hawke, who was a tremendous support and inspiration to Bob and his family, and is also deeply and sorely missed by a nation who loved her also. Mr Speaker, Australia is grateful for the leadership and service of Robert James Lee Hawke. Australians all can rejoice for his life, having served his country tirelessly, diligently, selflessly and passionately. May he now rest in peace. Morrison: The achievements under Bob Hawke were not just economic, they were social as well. After all, economies are meant to serve people. He understood that. They make those great social reforms possible. They were landmark social reforms made possible by that economic success. Social reforms that became embedded in our national life and now, in so many cases, enjoy bipartisan support ... the card we all carry in our pockets is a reminder of his great contribution. And its promise of universal access is an achievement that has stood, and will always stand the test of time. As was the outlawing of gender discrimination in the workplace. Morrison announced the government would fund the Bob Hawke scholarship foundation at Monash University in his honour, to help \u201cyoung Australians with ability and leadership potential to develop their skills at leading overseas universities\u201d. I believe that this is an appropriate way to recognise the memory of such a great Australian. To see it lived out in the lives of many great Australians who will follow in his footsteps in this regard and into the future. Morrison: In 1983, Bob Hawke campaigned on the slogan, \u201cBringing Australians together\u201d, and so he did. From 1983 to 1991, Bob Hawke led a government that redefined our nation forever. Floating the dollar, deregulating the financial system, admitting foreign banks, dismantling tariffs, starting the privatisation of government-owned businesses. Microeconomic reform in partnership with the states and territories. Retirement incomes for all workers. With sights firmly fixed on the long-term with his team, Bob Hawke opened up the Australian economy to the world, increasing competition, laying the foundation for 25 years and more of economic growth that continues to this day. Now, of course, it might not have seemed that way during the dislocation of the 1980s and the recession of the early 1990s, but our country had certainly, at that point, turned outward under his leadership, and I also wish to acknowledge that this work was done in a partnership most significantly with his treasurer, Paul Keating. But it was also a work that was largely, almost completely supported by those who sat in opposition. Now, this was achieved by Bob Hawke\u2019s leadership, and that\u2019s what I acknowledge. His leadership to embrace common-sense, common good economic reforms, to make Australia stronger and to bring Australians together for that purpose. He had many fights. Within this place, within his own ranks of his own party, and outside of this place. But such was his passion, such was his commitment, such was his determination to see the future of Australia going down a common ground path that will be forever to his credit, and we will be forever in his debt. And as a result of his vision and commitment, the tempo and direction of this economic reform agenda that, indeed, started under the Hawke government, has continued long after that to this day. Under my government, and beyond. The condolence motions have begun for Bob Hawke. Scott Morrison has started the speeches in the House. Following the condolence motions the House will adjourn as a mark of respect. Morrison: The honourable Robert James Lee Hawke AC, the 23rd prime minister of Australia, and places on record its appreciation of his remarkable service to our nation, which he loved. And offers its deepest sympathy to his family in their bereavement and, indeed, to the nation. Mr Speaker, the first prime minister to speak at this despatch box in this chamber, in this magnificent parliament building was Robert James Lee Hawke. But that meant he was also the last prime minister to do so at the despatch box at the old parliament house in the House of Representatives chamber down the hill. And in so many ways, not just that physical way, he took our country from the old to the new. He was personal enough that everyAustralian felt connected to him, regardless of their politics. And big enough that we actually entitled an era after him \u2013 the Hawke era. As I said at his memorial, which I was very grateful to the Hawke family and to Blanche for being invited to participate \u2013 Australians loved him just as he loved them. There was a great romance that played itself out in every part of this land with Bob Hawke. They knew each other, he and the Australian people. They forgave each other. They understood each other\u2019s virtues and they identified with each other\u2019s weaknesses. In Bob Hawke\u2019s own words, it was a \u201clove affair\u201d, and indeed it was. The bells are ringing \u2013 the day is officially about to get under way. The speaking list for the Senate condolence motions for Bob Hawke has been released. As you would expect, it is mostly Labor senators. But there are a few non-Labor senators, including Malcolm Roberts and Matt Canavan. Sarah Hanson-Young and Janet Rice are also on the list. Anyone can add or remove themselves from the list and they can do it at anytime, so expect that to grow. Jim Chalmers had a chat to ABC\u2019s AM this morning. He was asked about Labor\u2019s position on the tax package now, as compared to before and during the election: We\u2019ve shifted our position in recognition that the economy has deteriorated, even since the election, and that we weren\u2019t successful at the election. We\u2019ve shifted our position. We\u2019ve said we\u2019re prepared to cop stage two. We\u2019ve got a better way to deliver it sooner. The government, remarkably, voted against their own tax cuts being delivered sooner. The so-called \u201cparty of lower taxes\u201d voted against a tax cut this year because they\u2019ve put a higher premium on tax cuts in five years than tax cuts this week. But the point that I wanted to make, Sabra, is our position is guided by boosting the economy, by giving every Australian worker a tax cut in this term of the parliament. But thirdly, not saddling the budget with stage three of the tax cuts, which is a $95bn cost to the economy, which doesn\u2019t come in for another five years. This is a government which hasn\u2019t got the economy right at any turn now pretending that they know what the budget and the economy will look like in five years\u2019 time. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s responsible. Meanwhile, back in the real world, confidence in the economy is not fantastic. The RBA has made as much of a plea as it can for the government to kickstart spending. From Philip Lowe: It is important to think about the task ahead holistically. Monetary policy does have a significant role to play and our actions are helping to support the Australian economy, but we should not rely on monetary policy alone. We will achieve better outcomes if the various arms of public policy are all pointing in the same direction. That is as much of FRICKING DO SOMETHING as the very dry RBA governor can make. A big part of the problem? Stagnant wage growth. We know that people on low and middle incomes tend to spend their money. If they are trying to hold on to as much of their income as possible, it\u2019s because they can\u2019t afford to live, so they make choices. Foregoing discretionary spending is one of the first moves. We also know that Newstart hasn\u2019t shifted in real terms for more than two decades. The business community wants Newstart increased because not only can people not afford to look for work on the allowance, they can\u2019t afford to live. That\u2019s not necessarily altruistic \u2013 business knows that any increase in Newstart will be spent. And that\u2019s what capitalism relies on. Higher income earners, though, they don\u2019t tend to spend their increases. They save it. Because they can. You may have seen we posted the list of legislation for the next few sittings. You may have also noticed some of the parenthesis legislation names. And just how utterly out of control they are. For example, the tax bill\u2019s name is \u2018tax relief so working Australians keep more of their money\u2019. Well Labor added to that bullshit overnight, calling its amendment \u2018tax relief so working Australians keep more of their money, but not for a really long time\u2019. It\u2019s not funny. It\u2019s cheap. The schedule for the day is out: Greg Hunt\u2019s office has released some good news on the health front: HIV diagnoses in Australia is the lowest in almost 20 years due to increased prevention measures, earlier testing and treatment. In an Australian first, we have now seen significant reductions in new HIV diagnoses recorded at the national level thanks to the commitment of governments, healthcare, community and research sector. The Kirby Institute at UNSW Sydney\u2019s National HIV Quarterly notifications 2014\u20132018 report confirmed 835 HIV diagnoses across Australia in 2018 compared to 964 cases in 2017. This represents a decline in new diagnoses of 23 per cent in the past five years and this is the lowest number of new diagnoses since 2001. The largest decline in HIV diagnoses has been seen in men who have sex with men, which has declined by 30 per cent in the past five years. This incredible result is also because of a strong uptake among gay and bisexual men of the daily HIV prevention medication pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which our Government listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) on 1 April 2018.\u201d And just your semi-regular reminder that a HIV diagnosis is not a death sentence. Kristina Keneally was speaking on that very issue this morning: Australia continues to face a number of threats and that is something that our security agencies are quite alive to, as I\u2019ve said, when it comes to this particular legislation, we know that it deals with a specific cohort of people in limited cohorts of people, and the people that we know and understand, some of whom may seek to do Australia harm, or endanger public safety on their return. We support the intent of the legislation which is to have an appropriate mechanism in place to manage the return of these people to Australia. And we do stand ready to work with the government once they have responded to the PJCIS report, that report that Andrew Hastie from the committee he chairs and one that Labor and Liberals have given bipartisan support to 18 recommendations. Here is what Peter Dutton had to say this morning about the temporary exclusion laws he wants: We are going to introduce the laws this week. This passed through the party room and it\u2019s been to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, so it\u2019s been a welcome bill based on the UK law where the government can exclude people for up to two years, which is what we are proposing here, and we need the support of the Labor party, obviously, but we want to get the laws through as quickly as possible. They build on the changes we have already made to make sure that we can keep Australians safe. Now the PJCIS hasn\u2019t exactly waved it through. Here is its report from 3 April. This isn\u2019t Labor holding it up. The intelligence committee is bipartisan, but the Liberals hold the numbers. It is also chaired by Andrew Hastie. And it wants the bill changed. Including this: The Committee recommends that the Bill be amended so that: subject to the third dot point below, consistent with the preventive detention order regime, a temporary exclusion order may only be issued by an \u2018issuing authority\u2019 (being a judge, a retired judge or a senior member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal) on application by the Minister, the issuing authority must approve any condition set out in a return permit, and in respect of urgent situations, the Minister may issue a temporary exclusion order, or impose a condition in a return permit, without the approval of an issuing authority, provided that: the Minister obtain the approval of an issuing authority for the temporary exclusion order as soon as reasonably practicable, and if the issuing authority does not approve of the temporary exclusion order, the Minister must immediately revoke the order. It is up to the government to say whether or not it wants to amend its bill to include those recommendations. That\u2019s the holdup. Jacqui Lambie speaks! The Tasmanian senator stopped and had a chat to media outside the Senate doors on her way into the building a couple of minutes ago. She didn\u2019t say what she is doing, but she did say that she had some concerns over stage three \u2013 that\u2019s the part of the tax plan which will cost the budget $95bn from 2024, by creating a flat 30% tax rate for those earning between $45,000 and $200,000. Lambie said she had spent the past 18 months on the ground (after she resigned from the 45th Senate because of section 44 issues) and she had not seen a lot of evidence that the benefits were being translated where they were needed most. But asked about the politics of the bill, given that Labor\u2019s amendments will most likely fail because the government would just strike them back out in the House, Lambie said: I am watching it play out. You know what politics is like, it changes more than you change your undies. That was quite the evening. After almost two days of pomp and ceremony, the 46th parliament jumped straight into it. The government\u2019s tax plan was first off the bat but press freedom also got a guernsey. Labor voted to pass the tax cuts through the House \u2013 not that it matters from a numbers point of view, as the government has a majority. But it matters from the optics. All eyes are on Labor, because the tax plan \u2013 particularly tranche three \u2013 stands against everything the opposition has been building its policy platform on for the past six years. If it decides to pass the whole package in the Senate, that\u2019s a signal that things are about to change for the party. But first, Labor will attempt to have its amendments to the bill passed in the Senate. It wants the already legislated stage two to come into effect earlier, and the third tranche of this package delayed. The government says no, and looks to have the necessary crossbench support to get it across the line \u2013 so watch this space. Meanwhile, about an hour after Kristina Keneally announced Labor\u2019s plan to hold an inquiry into press freedom, the government announced it too was looking at an inquiry into press freedom. Whether there are two inquiries (and at this stage, that is a possibility) will depend on what is in the government\u2019s suggestion \u2013 and whether or not whistleblowers are also included. Peter Dutton meanwhile, wants to bring in laws to ban Australians involved in terrorism activities overseas from returning for at least two years. They\u2019re based on similar UK laws but the joint intelligence committee which looked at the issue last year \u2013 and is led by the Liberal Andrew Hastie \u2013 had some concerns about the laws, particularly the lack of judicial oversight. In the UK, a judge signs off on the order, while in Australia it was to be the minister. Still, the government will push forward \u2013 we will wait to see if it responds to the joint intelligence committee\u2019s recommendations. So a big day. But most of that will be happening behind the scenes, with the official parts of the day taken up by condolence motions for Bob Hawke. So no debate until tomorrow. We\u2019ll bring you everything that happens, as it does. Mike Bowers was here late last night, so I\u2019ll bring you some of what he shot. The Guardian brains trust is on the job. I need another coffee, quite desperately. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

SSA workers noted the new provisions in the union contract will further hurt working conditions at the agency, which they say is already suffering low morale. Jackson said: \u201cIf the government is going to be a premier place to work, employees are going to have to be treated more than indentured servants and have working conditions comparable to private industry, where freedom is not going to be restricted by a few, or otherwise the government is not going to be able to hold and sustain employees.\u201d Judith Browning, a social security employee in West Virginia, said the provisions will prevent whistleblowers from coming forward, as they will no longer have union protection, provide management with authoritarian power over employees, and set a dangerous anti-union precedent for all federal employees. In 2013, workers at Browning\u2019s office exposed the biggest social security disability fraud scheme in US history. She noted the only time she has now to assist workers with union representation is on the weekends at home, taking time away from her family. \u201cPresident Trump issued the executive orders targeting our union in order to target all federal employees,\u201d Browning said. \u201cTrump is going to allow management to basically fire us for no reason. We\u2019re an at-will agency now. It gives the discretion to the supervisors to terminate employees without representation, without a reason.\u201d The SSA did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",

Cycle lanes increase congestion (and thus pollution)</h2> <p>This is perhaps the most common myth, possibly because critics confuse what <em>feels </em>like it\u2019s true with what actually <em>is</em> true: the assumption that if you take some road space from motor vehicles, you get more traffic jams \u2013 as with (a commonly used parallel) forcing water down a smaller pipe.</p> <p>But fluid and traffic are not the same thing, as shown by 60 years of governments trying and failing to road-build their way out of congestion. The idea <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/induced-travel-demand-an-evidence-review\">of induced demand</a> \u2013 more road space brings more cars \u2013 has been known for decades, and it also works in reverse. This is especially so with bike lanes, which are such an efficient use of the same space that they can often mean the same amount of space carrying more people overall.</p> <p>Yes, traffic jams have worsened in some cities where bike lanes have been built, but <a href=\"http://content.tfl.gov.uk/understanding-and-managing-congestion-in-london.pdf\">studies show</a> this is largely down to other factors, for example the growth in the number of Uber-type private hire vehicles and Amazon delivery vans.</p> <p>Most compelling of all, of course, is the fact that motor vehicles cause the congestion in the first place, and the only real way to reduce traffic congestion is to have fewer of them on the roads.</p> <h2>2. Hardly anyone uses them</h2> <p>It seems that on Twitter you\u2019re never more than 10 minutes away from seeing a bike lane critic post a photo of an empty cycle route with the triumphant message: \u201cSee?!\u201d Often this is just a cunningly timed picture, but other factors are at play, not least the efficiency of cycle lanes, which means any \u201ctraffic\u201d tends to rapidly bunch up at red lights.</p> <p>Around the world, in just about every city where proper cycle routes have been built, many more riders start using them. One classic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jan/28/seville-cycling-capital-southern-europe-bike-lanes\">example is Seville</a> in southern Spain, where the recent construction of 50 miles of bike lanes led to an 11-fold increase in rider numbers.</p> <h2>3. They\u2019re only used by white, middle-class men/commuters</h2> <p>The myth-busting here comes in two parts: first, it\u2019s not as true as some argue, and second, where it is an issue, this is a sign that you need more safe cycling routes, not fewer.</p> <p>But yes, poorer people and those from minority ethnic backgrounds do ride bikes. Transport for London <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/human_streets_0.pdf\">statistics show</a> the ethnic mix of the city\u2019s cyclists roughly matches that of the population. In the US, the group most like to cycle (or walk) to work <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2014/acs/acs-25.html\">are those from households</a> with incomes of less than $10,000 (\u00a37,930) a year \u2013 ie the very poor.</p> <p>The other thing to stress is that the more obviously safe the cycling in your town or city, the <a href=\"https://www.transalt.org/sites/default/files/news/reports/2015/TransAlt_5th_6th_Avenue_Report.pdf\">more diverse and mixed the people on bikes</a>. Without proper infrastructure, cycling becomes something of a specialist pursuit, mainly restricted to what you might call the hobbyists \u2013 people with the more expensive bike, the greater confidence and the willingness to mix it with motor traffic.</p> <p>The converse is seen in places such as the Netherlands and Denmark: while \u201ccyclists\u201d \u2013 people who have a drawerful of Lycra and an interest in gear ratios \u2013 do exist, they\u2019re a different breed from the mass of everyday transport riders, who in socioeconomic terms encompass more or less everyone from royalty downwards.</p> <p>A series of barely connected bike lanes, such as in London, might be fine for commuters but people who make more varied journeys \u2013 for example those (disproportionately women) who need to go to work via a school and back via a shop \u2013 require a coherent network, including the other half of the safe-cycling equation, tamed backstreets, where cars are reduced in number and travel at slow speeds.</p> <h2>4. They\u2019re bad for business</h2> <p>Some of the noisiest opponents of recent London bike lanes have been individual business owners, who argue that a separated bike lane and any loss of parking will be fatal to their enterprise.</p> <p>In broad terms, however, this is completely wrong. Towns, cities and individual high streets are changing in how they compete. The growth of internet shopping means they must appeal more as destinations, which is hard to do amid wall-to-wall traffic.</p> <p>Studies <a href=\"http://cidadanialxmob.tripod.com/shoppersandhowtheytravel.pdf\">have shown</a> that shop owners tend to overestimate the proportion of customers who arrive by car, and that consumers on bikes often purchase <a href=\"http://www.cycling-embassy.dk/2013/08/26/are-cyclists-good-customers/\">more in the long term</a>.</p> <p>Perhaps the most comprehensive study of the real-world impact of cycle lanes, <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/dot-economic-benefits-of-sustainable-streets.pdf\">undertaken in New York City</a>, found businesses on streets with separated bike routes grew on average more quickly than those without. In contrast, I know of no evidence that points the other way.</p> <h2>5. They\u2019re dangerous for pedestrians</h2> <p>A surprisingly common charge \u2013 surprising in that it has absolutely no basis in logic, let alone reality. Sure, some elements of cycle lane design might seem new to Britons \u2013 for example, <a href=\"https://www.cycling-embassy.org.uk/dictionary/floating-bus-stop\">\u201cfloating\u201d bus stops</a> where passengers cross a cycle lane to reach them \u2013 but when they\u2019re designed well there is no evidence they cause danger.</p> <p>More basically, there\u2019s no getting away from the fact that motor vehicles are much, much, much more dangerous. On average each year in the UK between zero and two pedestrians die after being hit by bikes. About 400 a year die after being hit by motor vehicles, including more than 60 struck while on the pavement.</p> <p>As cannot be repeated enough, this is not about cyclists being somehow morally pure. It\u2019s just physics. It\u2019s possible to kill or maim someone if you are a 100kg-ish bike-and-human combination travelling at 12mph, but is extremely unlikely. In a 1.5-tonne SUV at 35mph, it is hideously easy.</p> <h2>6. Cyclists just break laws, so they shouldn\u2019t get lanes</h2> <p>This is such a silly idea it\u2019s baffling that it still needs regular debunking. <em>People</em> break road laws, on all forms of road transport, and if anything they do so more often on average in motor vehicles.</p> <p>Government data from actual recorded speeds <a href=\"https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/car-news/consumer-news/100009/more-than-half-of-drivers-break-30mph-speed-limits\">shows 52% of </a><a href=\"https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/car-news/consumer-news/100009/more-than-half-of-drivers-break-30mph-speed-limits\">drivers break the speed limit</a> in 30mph zones. In 20mph zones the figure is 86% \u2013 or 92% in the early hours of the day. Millions of drivers admit to <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/ten-million-drivers-using-phones-at-wheel-despite-higher-penalties-study-says-11671188\">using phones at the wheel</a>. All this, it\u2019s worth stressing, is behaviour that can and does frequently end or permanently change lives. Cyclists jumping red lights, as annoying and even intimidating as it can be \u2013 and I\u2019m not condoning it \u2013 isn\u2019t the same. As ever, this is all about the physics.</p> <h2>7. How do I carry work tools/a fridge on a bike?</h2> <p>See also: \u201cMy 85-year-old granny has two plastic hips and walks with a Zimmer frame \u2013 how do you expect her to ride everywhere?\u201d</p> <p>The most tempting response to this is a deep sigh: no one to my knowledge has suggested that if you build safe cycling routes, that will be the only form of transport on offer, let alone compulsory. And while there\u2019s a wider case for removing private cars from urban areas, even if you build cycling infrastructure then roads and cars \u2013 as well as buses \u2013 will still exist. They will also move more freely for those who really need them.</p> <p>Regarding heavy loads: again, no one says all road freight must vanish. But it\u2019s also worth noting that cargo bikes or trailers, especially with electric-assist, can carry heavy loads \u2013 even that hypothetical fridge. Some tradespeople, <a href=\"https://www.about.sainsburys.co.uk/news/latest-news/2018/18-04-2018-electriccargobiketrial\">even supermarkets</a>, already use cargo bikes, particularly in big cities where distances are shorter and parking scarce. More widely there is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/nov/18/innovative-delivery-system-transforming-gothenburg-roads\">huge potential scope</a> for \u201clast mile\u201d deliveries, especially of Amazon-size packages, to be moved from vans to cargo bikes.</p> <h2>8. We\u2019re not the Netherlands/Denmark</h2> <p>The slightly trite riposte is that at one point even the Netherlands was not the Netherlands. In the early 1970s the Dutch had some of the worst cycling casualty rates in the world, as roads used for decades by cyclists were filled with more and more cars. This <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/may/05/amsterdam-bicycle-capital-world-transport-cycling-kindermoord\">prompted a mass protest movement</a>, the result of which was 40-plus years of building safe infrastructure. Ultimately, it\u2019s about political will.</p> <p>See also: \u201cBut the Netherlands/Denmark are flat.\u201d Yes, they are, though a classic Dutch headwind can feel like riding up a steep incline. But this is also by no means a deal breaker, especially in the e-bike era. Bristol, for example, has relatively high rates of cycling for the UK, and it\u2019s not exactly flat.</p> <p>See also: \u201cAh, but London/Edinburgh/you name it are old cities with narrow streets.\u201d This is perhaps the most desperate plea of the lot. It\u2019s not as if Amsterdam or Copenhagen are Milton Keynes.</p> <h2>9. They cost too much</h2> <p>Amazingly, this does get said, often accompanied by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2010/mar/18/cyclists-road-tax-drivers\">curiously enduring myth</a> that cyclists \u201cdon\u2019t pay for the roads\u201d.</p> <p>As Chris Boardman, the cycle campaigner turned cycle tsar for Greater Manchester, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2019/jun/24/what-14bn-buys-1800-miles-of-cycle-lanes-or-one-big-roundabout\">noted last month</a>, his planned revamp of the region would cost \u00a31.5bn and would deliver 1,800 miles of safer cycling. That might sound a lot, he said, until you remember that the government has agreed to spend \u00a31.4bn <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-47290440\">improving a single roundabout</a> in Bedfordshire. So yes, by transport standards, cycling is an absolute bargain.</p> <h2>10. There\u2019s no need</h2> <p>This is, in effect, the message of the critics: not this, not now \u2013 let\u2019s try to get away with unambitious schemes without proper infrastructure, which will never change much.</p> <p>You could write a whole column \u2013 even a book \u2013 about why this is absurd, but it\u2019s always worth stressing this point to the cycling naysayers: OK, what\u2019s your solution to gridlock, pollution, a climate emergency; to cities that are noisy, dangerous and unjust? They will not respond, because there is no answer.</p>",

Most compelling of all, of course, is the fact that motor vehicles cause the congestion in the first place, and the only real way to reduce traffic congestion is to have fewer of them on the roads. 2. Hardly anyone uses them It seems that on Twitter you\u2019re never more than 10 minutes away from seeing a bike lane critic post a photo of an empty cycle route with the triumphant message: \u201cSee?!\u201d Often this is just a cunningly timed picture, but other factors are at play, not least the efficiency of cycle lanes, which means any \u201ctraffic\u201d tends to rapidly bunch up at red lights. Around the world, in just about every city where proper cycle routes have been built, many more riders start using them. One classic example is Seville in southern Spain, where the recent construction of 50 miles of bike lanes led to an 11-fold increase in rider numbers. 3. They\u2019re only used by white, middle-class men/commuters The myth-busting here comes in two parts: first, it\u2019s not as true as some argue, and second, where it is an issue, this is a sign that you need more safe cycling routes, not fewer. But yes, poorer people and those from minority ethnic backgrounds do ride bikes. Transport for London statistics show the ethnic mix of the city\u2019s cyclists roughly matches that of the population. In the US, the group most like to cycle (or walk) to work are those from households with incomes of less than $10,000 (\u00a37,930) a year \u2013 ie the very poor. The other thing to stress is that the more obviously safe the cycling in your town or city, the more diverse and mixed the people on bikes. Without proper infrastructure, cycling becomes something of a specialist pursuit, mainly restricted to what you might call the hobbyists \u2013 people with the more expensive bike, the greater confidence and the willingness to mix it with motor traffic. The converse is seen in places such as the Netherlands and Denmark: while \u201ccyclists\u201d \u2013 people who have a drawerful of Lycra and an interest in gear ratios \u2013 do exist, they\u2019re a different breed from the mass of everyday transport riders, who in socioeconomic terms encompass more or less everyone from royalty downwards. A series of barely connected bike lanes, such as in London, might be fine for commuters but people who make more varied journeys \u2013 for example those (disproportionately women) who need to go to work via a school and back via a shop \u2013 require a coherent network, including the other half of the safe-cycling equation, tamed backstreets, where cars are reduced in number and travel at slow speeds. 4. They\u2019re bad for business Some of the noisiest opponents of recent London bike lanes have been individual business owners, who argue that a separated bike lane and any loss of parking will be fatal to their enterprise. In broad terms, however, this is completely wrong. Towns, cities and individual high streets are changing in how they compete. The growth of internet shopping means they must appeal more as destinations, which is hard to do amid wall-to-wall traffic. Studies have shown that shop owners tend to overestimate the proportion of customers who arrive by car, and that consumers on bikes often purchase more in the long term. Perhaps the most comprehensive study of the real-world impact of cycle lanes, undertaken in New York City, found businesses on streets with separated bike routes grew on average more quickly than those without. In contrast, I know of no evidence that points the other way. 5. They\u2019re dangerous for pedestrians A surprisingly common charge \u2013 surprising in that it has absolutely no basis in logic, let alone reality. Sure, some elements of cycle lane design might seem new to Britons \u2013 for example, \u201cfloating\u201d bus stops where passengers cross a cycle lane to reach them \u2013 but when they\u2019re designed well there is no evidence they cause danger. More basically, there\u2019s no getting away from the fact that motor vehicles are much, much, much more dangerous. On average each year in the UK between zero and two pedestrians die after being hit by bikes. About 400 a year die after being hit by motor vehicles, including more than 60 struck while on the pavement. As cannot be repeated enough, this is not about cyclists being somehow morally pure. It\u2019s just physics. It\u2019s possible to kill or maim someone if you are a 100kg-ish bike-and-human combination travelling at 12mph, but is extremely unlikely. In a 1.5-tonne SUV at 35mph, it is hideously easy. 6. Cyclists just break laws, so they shouldn\u2019t get lanes This is such a silly idea it\u2019s baffling that it still needs regular debunking. People break road laws, on all forms of road transport, and if anything they do so more often on average in motor vehicles. Government data from actual recorded speeds shows 52% of drivers break the speed limit in 30mph zones. In 20mph zones the figure is 86% \u2013 or 92% in the early hours of the day. Millions of drivers admit to using phones at the wheel. All this, it\u2019s worth stressing, is behaviour that can and does frequently end or permanently change lives. Cyclists jumping red lights, as annoying and even intimidating as it can be \u2013 and I\u2019m not condoning it \u2013 isn\u2019t the same. As ever, this is all about the physics. 7. How do I carry work tools/a fridge on a bike? See also: \u201cMy 85-year-old granny has two plastic hips and walks with a Zimmer frame \u2013 how do you expect her to ride everywhere?\u201d The most tempting response to this is a deep sigh: no one to my knowledge has suggested that if you build safe cycling routes, that will be the only form of transport on offer, let alone compulsory. And while there\u2019s a wider case for removing private cars from urban areas, even if you build cycling infrastructure then roads and cars \u2013 as well as buses \u2013 will still exist. They will also move more freely for those who really need them. Regarding heavy loads: again, no one says all road freight must vanish. But it\u2019s also worth noting that cargo bikes or trailers, especially with electric-assist, can carry heavy loads \u2013 even that hypothetical fridge. Some tradespeople, even supermarkets, already use cargo bikes, particularly in big cities where distances are shorter and parking scarce. More widely there is huge potential scope for \u201clast mile\u201d deliveries, especially of Amazon-size packages, to be moved from vans to cargo bikes. 8. We\u2019re not the Netherlands/Denmark The slightly trite riposte is that at one point even the Netherlands was not the Netherlands. In the early 1970s the Dutch had some of the worst cycling casualty rates in the world, as roads used for decades by cyclists were filled with more and more cars. This prompted a mass protest movement, the result of which was 40-plus years of building safe infrastructure. Ultimately, it\u2019s about political will. See also: \u201cBut the Netherlands/Denmark are flat.\u201d Yes, they are, though a classic Dutch headwind can feel like riding up a steep incline. But this is also by no means a deal breaker, especially in the e-bike era. Bristol, for example, has relatively high rates of cycling for the UK, and it\u2019s not exactly flat. See also: \u201cAh, but London/Edinburgh/you name it are old cities with narrow streets.\u201d This is perhaps the most desperate plea of the lot. It\u2019s not as if Amsterdam or Copenhagen are Milton Keynes. 9. They cost too much Amazingly, this does get said, often accompanied by the curiously enduring myth that cyclists \u201cdon\u2019t pay for the roads\u201d. As Chris Boardman, the cycle campaigner turned cycle tsar for Greater Manchester, noted last month, his planned revamp of the region would cost \u00a31.5bn and would deliver 1,800 miles of safer cycling. That might sound a lot, he said, until you remember that the government has agreed to spend \u00a31.4bn improving a single roundabout in Bedfordshire. So yes, by transport standards, cycling is an absolute bargain. 10. There\u2019s no need This is, in effect, the message of the critics: not this, not now \u2013 let\u2019s try to get away with unambitious schemes without proper infrastructure, which will never change much. You could write a whole column \u2013 even a book \u2013 about why this is absurd, but it\u2019s always worth stressing this point to the cycling naysayers: OK, what\u2019s your solution to gridlock, pollution, a climate emergency; to cities that are noisy, dangerous and unjust? They will not respond, because there is no answer.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump won the presidency but never scored an Emmy for the Apprentice despite 15 seasons and 192 episodes. Come this Independence Day, however, the president will star in a movie of his own making. On the Fourth of July, the president will produce and take center stage in his own remake of Gladiator, Ridley Scott\u2019s Academy Award-winning tale of a debauched and self-venerating Roman emperor. Broadcast and filmed before a live audience from the Lincoln Memorial, Trump\u2019s extravaganza looms as a cinematic production befitting his politics and persona. Complete with tanks, accompanied by military flyovers, and flanked by the service branches\u2019 brass, Trump will seek to honor himself as he ostensibly pays tribute to the American republic and the anniversary of our cord-cutting from England. Commodus, the affection-deprived despot of Scott\u2019s 2000 epic, would most certainly be envious. It\u2019s not every day that Americans get to see mothballed Sherman tanks sitting under the 16th president\u2019s marble gaze or America\u2019s military forced to act as props for the commander-in-chief. Kim Jong-un, will you be watching? For the record, James Mattis, Trump\u2019s last non-acting defense secretary, and John Kelly, his last non-acting chief of staff, both retired generals, had their fill of their bone-spur afflicted and draft-dodging former boss. Or as a now former White House official told me at the time, Mattis was \u201cnot grateful\u201d. To be sure, the US honors its soldiers and their victories. In the aftermath of the civil war, the first world war, the second world war, and the Gulf war, the country threw deserved celebrations, our soldiers rightly marched in our streets. As for a show of force for its own sake, however, that is a different story. Dwight Eisenhower, the general who led the way in the second world war and served as our 34th president, took a dim view of military parades for their own sake. As the historian Michael Beschloss observed, Eisenhower saw America as the world\u2019s pre-eminent power and believed that imitating the Soviets \u201cwould make us look weak\u201d. Not according to this president or his political allies. As in the movie Gladiator, proximity to power can be warping. Take Newt Gingrich, the disgraced former speaker of the House, for example. With Callista, his third wife, ensconced in Rome as ambassador to the Vatican, Gingrich called opponents of Trump\u2019s planned extravaganza \u201cidiots\u201d. In Gingrich\u2019s own words, \u201cOther than the fact they have to pay to fix the streets, who cares?\u201d But back in the day, Gingrich sounded nothing like that. During the Clinton presidency Gingrich fancied himself as the second coming of William Pitt, the 18th-century British prime minister, and backed impeaching Clinton for obstruction of justice. When Barack Obama lived in the White House, Gingrich intimated that Obama was King John reborn, the monarch brought to heel at Runnymede. Still, for Trump himself, pomp, circumstance and self-worship should come as no surprise. To quote an early Trump backer and a major player in New York real estate shortly after Trump\u2019s inauguration: \u201cWe don\u2019t have a president, we have a king.\u201d Not exactly. The kings of yore were subject to few checks from the bench, and Trump\u2019s record with the judiciary has been mixed. Although he jammed Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh through Senate confirmation, the courts still vigorously push back. Still, after the G20 summit, it is clear that Trump hankers for a dynasty and sees himself as sitting atop a royal household. Last week, the supreme court blocked Trump\u2019s census question and a federal court ruled that Trump\u2019s bypassing Congress to pay for his big and beautiful border wall was unconstitutional. This spring, another federal court held that a congressional subpoena reached documents held by Trump\u2019s personal accountants. As the appellate brief filed in the ongoing appeal by the House framed things: \u201cThe fact that Mr. Trump dislikes the Oversight Committee\u2019s investigations is no basis for this Court to reverse the district court\u2019s well-reasoned judgment.\u201d Perhaps not. But this is the same President Trump who also threatened a Time magazine photographer with prison when Trump feared that he was about to snap a shot of the Korean dictator\u2019s letter to the president: \u201cYou can go to prison instead, because, if you use, if you use the photograph you took of the letter that I gave you \u2026 confidentially, I didn\u2019t give it to you to take photographs of it, so don\u2019t play that game with me.\u201d Prison!

The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/27/climate-change-human-fingerprint-found-on-global-extreme-weather\">strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves</a> (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America.</p>\n    <p>When these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Most of the planet\u2019s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons. <a href=\"https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/another-unprecedented-tropical-cyclone-and-flooding-hits-mozambique\">Record-breaking cyclones hit Mozambique</a> in March and April.

      "body": "<p>\u201cLove? Love fades away. But things? Things are forever.\u201d So says Tom, played by Aziz Ansari, in a scene from Parks and Recreation. The phrase has become a meme, a tongue-in-cheek defense of modern materialism.</p> <p>The essential thinginess of capitalism has been one of its most-criticized features. Materialism, and specifically consumerism, are almost always used as pejorative terms. Nostalgic conservatives, egalitarian progressives and environmentalists loudly agree on at least one thing: we are just buying too much stuff.</p> <p>They\u2019re not wrong. The US self-storage market <a href=\"https://www.curbed.com/2018/3/27/17168088/cheap-storage-warehouse-self-storage-real-estate\">is already worth $38</a><a href=\"https://www.curbed.com/2018/3/27/17168088/cheap-storage-warehouse-self-storage-real-estate\">b</a><a href=\"https://www.curbed.com/2018/3/27/17168088/cheap-storage-warehouse-self-storage-real-estate\">n, and growing fast</a>. Almost <a href=\"https://www.sparefoot.com/self-storage/news/1432-self-storage-industry-statistics/\">one in ten households are now renting extra space</a>. One feature of late capitalism is that many of us have more things than we have space for things.</p> <p>At its best, however, consumerism is a powerful, positive force. It allows for the expression of identity, it can hold sellers to public account, and it drives new thinking and development. But this is only the case when consumers are being served fairly in the market. Today, there is a pressing concern about whether the forces of \u201cbigness\u201d \u2013 a trend toward fewer larger companies \u2013 combined with a reluctance on the part of governments to intervene in consumer markets, is dampening innovation and narrowing choice.</p> <p>Before worrying about whether the market is serving consumers, we need to agree that it should. Critiques of consumerism have to be taken seriously before examining whether contemporary capitalism is friendly to consumers. These critiques usually come in four types: moral, aesthetic, financial, or environmental.</p> <p>The moral critique of consumerism is that the acquisition of things displaces more worthwhile activities or priorities. Instead of shopping, we should be spending time with friends and family, in places of worship, or in nature. Even as consumer societies meet our immediate, shallow desires, they are said to corrode our deeper selves. \u201cThey do not rejoice in what they have, no matter how much it is, so much as they lament what they still lack, or think they lack. Their soul is eaten away with cares as they compete in the struggle for success.\u201d That was <a href=\"https://www.svspress.com/on-social-justice-st-basil-the-great/\">Saint</a><a href=\"https://www.svspress.com/on-social-justice-st-basil-the-great/\"> Basil the Great</a>, sometime around the middle of the fourth century.</p> <p>But although materialism can be demoralizing and dispiriting, it is so probably only for a small minority of people. In reality, it is a question of balance. Things can be really useful, really cool or really fun. They can also enhance social life rather than diminish it.</p> <p>Back in the 1980s, the psychologist Milhaly Csikszentmihalyi interviewed all the members of 82 Chicago families about their favorite things. He discovered that happier families listed objects that reminded them of other people; a family memento, or a couch that had been in the family for years. Less happy ones listed more expensive items, citing their features rather than their history.</p> <p>Csikszentmihalyi\u2019s conclusion, <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/meaning-of-things/7AB6CD87B8C85B99FFE79DB86811C5A2\">in his 1981 book The Meaning of Things</a>, is that the \u201cwork\u201d of consumption does not end with the purchase; in fact, that is when it starts. Some things might prove to be worthless, others merely useful, but some acquire more meaning over time. It is not whether we consume things that matters, but how we do.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is not whether we consume things that matters, but how we do.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The second criticism of consumerism is aesthetic. Here the problem is the brashness, the showiness of material consumption, whether of goods or services. The aesthetic critic highlights not how much we consume, but what we consume. This criticism veers dangerously close, or even into, outright snobbery, as James Twitchell points out in his pro-consumption polemic Lead Us Into Temptation. \u201cOften the melancholy Eeyores condemning your consumption are confusing what you buy with what they buy,\u201d Twichell writes. \u201cThey can spend thousands of dollars hiking in Provence, but don\u2019t you even think of gambling away a sawbuck in Las Vegas.\u201d</p> <p>This is a salutary warning to consumerism\u2019s critics. In Britain during the 1970s, when cheaper air travel brought travel to warmer summer vacation destinations within reach of millions of workers, there was considerable elite disdain. The Labour politician <a href=\"http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/915997\">Tony Crosland fired back</a>: \u201cMy working-class constituents \u2026 want washing machines and refrigerators to relieve domestic drudgery ... and they want package tour holidays to Majorca. Why should they, too, not enjoy the sun?\u201d Why indeed?</p> <p>Third on the list of criticisms of consumerism is financial \u2013 specifically, the impact on personal finances of buying lots of stuff now, often using debt to do so, and putting too little aside for the future. We are induced, through sophisticated advertising efforts, to consume even more than we would in the absence of ministrations of marketeers. The knock against consumerism is that it displaces wiser spending or saving.</p> <p>As a rule, people find it hard to put high value on the distant future. Economists call this tendency \u201chyperbolic discounting\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.utilitarianism.com/mill2.htm\">John Stuart Mill noted</a> that people \u201coften reach for the nearer good, even though they know it to be less valuable\u201d. Note that the problem is not information \u2013 we know it to be less valuable. The problem is short termism.</p> <p>This is hardly a new problem, it is just that mature economies offer such a cornucopia of goods and services \u2013 available, now, at the click of a mouse \u2013 and life expectancy has risen so dramatically, that the challenges may now be greater. This, in turn, has justified collective interventions: most obviously, forced savings plans to fund government-provided pensions.</p> <p>It is a delicate balance, however. The same economists who worry about people saving enough for their retirement or for a negative life event worry on a different day about insufficient consumer demand. The solutions are less likely to lie in the direction of reduced consumer choice, however, than in the greater provision of public goods that act to protect us from ourselves.</p> <p>The fourth, and deepest, criticism of consumerism is environmental. Things take energy to make, transport, and use. Many services are energy-intensive too, with air travel just the most obvious example. Energy is scarce, and currently produced in ways that are heating up the planet.</p> <p>Consumerism, on this reading, is killing the planet. The only way to save the planet is to reduce energy use. And the only way to do that is to reduce consumption. But it is not clear that these statements are true. There are clean energy alternatives available, it\u2019s just a question of collectively moving towards them.</p> <p>The best of all worlds is probably to combine a carbon tax with a consumption tax, thereby pricing in externalities, and broadening the tax base to boot. Then we might be able to tax work a little less, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/24/capitalism-is-failing-workers-people-want-a-job-with-a-decent-wage-why-is-that-so-hard\">which would help hard-pressed families</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Consumers need protection from predatory, corrupt, or dishonest sellers; the market needs protection from monopoly power</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is, then, nothing intrinsically bad about consuming goods and services, and much that is good. Hence few critics of consumerism really want to turn back the clock. But it is important that the market serves consumers, as much as the other way round. That requires both to be protected: consumers need protection from predatory, corrupt or dishonest sellers; and the market needs protection from monopoly power, predatory pricing, and cronyism.</p> <p>\u201cConsumer protection\u201d and \u201cgovernment regulation\u201d have become curse words on the contemporary political right. But there are many consumer markets in which the stakes are high, and in which there is a stark asymmetry of information between buyer and seller. In these cases, such as financial services, there is a strong case for protection and regulation. The notion of \u201cconsumer sovereignty\u201d \u2013 that consumers exert power and authority over companies as an automatic result of market forces \u2013 is doubly dangerous, implying first that consumers always outrank workers and citizens, and second that consumers are all-powerful. In many cases, most consumers are unable to acquire the necessary knowledge to act even remotely regally in the market.</p> <p>Of course consumer protection can veer into paternalism. There is always a balance to be struck. Consumers are best served in markets that remain open and competitive. The statecraft required here is to encourage the creation of markets that do not leave consumers entirely at the mercy of companies, but without putting companies at the mercy of government. Somewhere between the Wild West and wartime rationing is what we are after.</p> <p>Edward Kleinbard, author of We Are Better Than This: How Government Should Spend Our Money, writes that the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/how-make-sense-candidates-economic-proposals/588685/\">binary distinction between socialist and capitalist economies misses the point</a>. What we need, he argues, are \u201cfriendly\u201d markets. These are markets which are both competitive and complete.</p> <p>In a competitive market, Kleinbard argues, \u201cno business can dictate prices to customers; all fight for survival in environments where profit margins are slim\u201d. This is not about being friendly to companies, but rather creating a \u201cmarketplace where businesses scrap for every little advantage\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The problem comes when companies become so large they can defend themselves with economic \u201cmoats\u201d against competition.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is one reason many contemporary economists are concerned about the dominance of particular sectors by a small number of companies. This is hardly a new worry. Most advanced economies have laws guarding against monopolies for precisely this reason, with ongoing political arguments about how tough these laws should be.</p> <p>For some, big is necessarily bad. For others, necessarily beautiful. But of course it depends. Does it matter that Starbucks now has 40% of the retail coffee market, and Dunkin\u2019 the next 30%? Probably not. There is nothing they can do to stop new entrants taking them on, just as nobody could stop a couple of teachers and a writer in Seattle from starting Starbucks in Pike Place in 1971, and then expanding to 14,000 stores worldwide.</p> <p>The problem comes when companies become so large that they can defend themselves with economic \u201cmoats\u201d against competition, by influencing policy to bend regulation and tax policy in their favor, snatching up likely rivals almost as soon as they hatch, and dominating the channels through which consumption takes place.</p> <p>Critically, a market that is friendly to consumers is not necessarily a market that delivers the lowest prices to consumers. But price has been the principal litmus test of mergers and acquisitions since Robert Bork\u2019s influential 1978 book The Antitrust Paradox. (The evidence on how mergers influence price <a href=\"https://cssh.northeastern.edu/economics/2015/03/qa-antitrust-economist-john-kwoka-says-mergers-mean-higher-prices/\">is in fact mixed</a>).</p> <p>Of course price matters, a lot. Economic hardship can be caused as readily by high costs as by low incomes. But consumers also need reassurance about future prices. Being at the mercy of a single company is bad: even if the company is merciful right now, what happens if it becomes less so in the future?</p> <p>The second test of a \u201cfriendly\u201d market, according to Kleinbard, is completeness. This test is passed when \u201creasonable economic desires find outlet in markets open to all under fair terms of participation\u201d. Most competitive consumer markets effectively complete themselves, providing different kinds and quality of goods and services to buyers of all kinds. But there are some goods and services where completeness requires regulation. Education and health care are two cases in point. To ensure access to all, these industries require heavy regulation or direct government provision. These are public goods, not private ones.</p> <p>That there are limits to free markets, especially in these kinds of areas, is accepted across the political spectrum. The argument is not over whether the government should reach into these arenas, but how far.</p> <p>So: consumption is not intrinsically bad. Indeed, buying things is one of the joys and privileges of a modern capitalist economy. But most of us, myopic creatures that we are, need a little help balancing present consumption with future consumption. The planet needs a lot of help to ensure that our consumption does not deplete our shared resources. Consumers need protection in high-stakes, complex areas like financial services, and public provision in others like health care and education.</p> <p>As well as becoming richer consumers, we also need to become better consumers. Not just in terms of being mindful of the impact of our consumption on the health of ourselves and the earth, but in discerning the kinds of consumption that will bring us the greatest benefits.</p> <p>Tibor Skitovsky, a Hungarian-American economist, argued that as opportunities for consumption expand, we need to be more skillful consumers, seeking out opportunities for what he called \u201ccreative consumption\u201d, focused on novelty and stimulation, rather than satiation. One of the deep problems with poverty, according to Skitovsky, is that it cuts people off from these consumption opportunities. You need money to consume; and you need more to consume creatively.</p> <p>In developed capitalist economies, our role as consumers does not trump our role as workers or citizens. But it is an important role nonetheless and one we should aim to improve in. Think of all the training that goes into being a better worker. Even a tiny fraction of that might make a difference in terms of making us better consumers. In the end, the promise of capitalism to consumers lies not only in the hands of the regulators, marketeers, and providers, but also in the pocketbooks of consumers themselves.</p> <ul> <li><p>Richard Reeves is the author of Dream Hoarders and a senior fellow at Brookings Institution.</p></li> <li><p>Read more from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/broken-capitalism\">Broken Capitalism</a> series, guest-edited by Richard Reeves.</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "The eminent economist Ross Garnaut has said Australia must come to terms with the looming reality that the global trading system is \u201cbreaking down\u201d. The US and China agreed to a ceasefire at the G20 summit in Japan at the weekend, after they slapped hundreds of billions in tariffs against each other in a trade war that Scott Morrison has warned risked \u201ccollateral damage\u201d around the world. But Donald Trump is a vocal critic of the existing global trading market and appears to view a more protectionist approach as vital to his electoral prospects in the industrial Mid-Western states which handed him the presidency in 2016. \u201cWe have to come to grips with what I\u2019m afraid is a looming reality, which is the trading system which has underpinned growth in the Asia-Pacific is breaking down,\u201d said Garnaut, a former adviser to the Hawke government. \u201cThe breakdown is a result of political responses, especially in the United States, but also in Europe, to some concerns that are valid, some concerns that are spurious and some concerns that have valid elements. \u201cThe valid concerns include some issues related to security and intellectual property rights.\u201d Amid that backdrop, Garnaut warned the \u201cbreakdown of the global system\u201d would reinforce oligopoly in the Australian economy and give rise to a return of \u201crent-seeking\u201d. \u201cA return to that world will be a return to the conditions that made Australian and New Zealand growth the lowest in the developed world in the 20th century, up until we changed all that with the reforms of the 1980s,\u201d he told the Melbourne Economic Forum on Wednesday. Offering a gloomy outlook, the former Australian trade minister Craig Emerson said the way nations were now approaching trade disputes was \u201calmost without precedent\u201d since the second world war and the establishment of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade. He said the US and China had both been \u201cflouting the rules\u201d but expressed particular worry at the Trump administration\u2019s attitude towards the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The WTO\u2019s dispute-settling body \u2013 essential a global trade court \u2013 looks likely to wind up its operations in December because the Trump administration has refused to appoint new members. \u201cThe Obama administration wasn\u2019t thrilled with this body but didn\u2019t want to dismantle it, the Trump administration does,\u201d Emerson said, citing the president\u2019s frustration at China\u2019s alleged dumping of steel. The former Labor cabinet minister said the absence of the WTO dispute-resolution body meant \u201cwe\u2019ll have a rules-based global trading system in name only\u201d. That would allow nations to adopt a more protectionist stance without the fear of legal repercussions. \u201cBecause if there are complaints, shoulders get shrugged, there\u2019s lots of tut-tutting, but that\u2019s the end of it,\u201d Emerson said. The International Monetary Fund has previously warned tit-for-tat tariffs would cost $455bn in lost output next year. Emerson said there was a global slowdown \u201ccoming in an environment where monetary policy is very easy and fiscal policy has been quite easy\u201d, describing the situation as \u201ca bit weird\u201d. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to be in a world, and I hope I\u2019m wrong ... where both the Democrats and the Republicans say we want nothing to do with a global rules based trading system and that would usher in a very, very uncertain and potentially dangerous time,\u201d he said. Morrison has encouraged Trump to end the trade war and said he also raised the negative impact of the dispute with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, at the G20. Garnaut suggested diplomacy would be key to turning the tide. \u201cMy starting point would be \u2026 to begin the process of real analysis \u2026 We are not without influence once we have a very clear view of where we want to go.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Morrison government is seeking to amend the Marriage Act as part of its religious discrimination act, the first time the act will have been amended since the legalisation of same-sex marriage following the postal survey in 2017. On the first day of the 46th parliament, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet released a list of legislation proposed to be introduced in the winter/spring sitting period. Included in the list is the religious discrimination bill, which the government said would \u201cmake it unlawful to discriminate against people on the ground of their religious belief or activity (including lack of religious belief) and establish the statutory office of the freedom of religion commissioner at the Australian Human Rights Commission\u201d. The legislation would amend a number of existing laws, according to the document, including \u201cmarriage law, charities law and \u2026 anti-discrimination legislation\u201d. Guardian Australia has sought comment from the attorney general\u2019s office. New legislation was first announced in the government\u2019s response to the Philip Ruddock-led review on religious freedom, which reported to government last year but was not introduced into parliament prior to the election being called in April. Among the changes to the Marriage Act, outlined in the government\u2019s response at the time, were plans to make it clear that religious organisations such as Catholic schools would not be required to make their halls available for same-sex marriage ceremonies, nor would they be required to provide services for same-sex weddings. At the time, the attorney general, Christian Porter, said the proposed religious discrimination legislation would \u201cnot necessarily be very contentious\u201d because it would be similar to other anti-discrimination legislation. While the legislation is planned, it doesn\u2019t appear to be written yet. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, reportedly told colleagues he wants to consult with Labor on the proposed legislation, and backbenchers will be allowed to shape the legislation through workshops with Porter starting later this week. Labor\u2019s shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, said Labor was willing to work with the government on the legislation. Due to earlier leaks about the contents of the Ruddock report, the government was facing pressure from Labor and LGBT groups to legislate to prevent LGBT students being kicked out of religious schools, or LGBT teachers from being fired from religious schools on the grounds of their sexuality or gender identity. The government instead asked the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) to determine how to balance the rights of non-discrimination of LGBT students and staff with religious schools\u2019 right to \u201cmaintain conduct and teaching in accordance with their faith\u201d. The ALRC report isn\u2019t due until April 2020. But Morrison and Porter are facing pressure from within their own party to bring the report forward to deal with all religious discrimination issues now in the wake of Israel Folau\u2019s contract being terminated by Rugby Australia over social media posts warning hell awaits gay people. In the Senate on Tuesday night, the Liberal senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells said the report deadline should be brought forward before any new law is passed. \u201cI believe that the recent election has reinforced not only the need for more immediate legislative action but also the need for a more amplified and comprehensive referral,\u201d she said. \u201cIndeed, it remains open to the attorney general to augment the ALRC referral and request that it report this year and before a religious freedom act is tabled.

      "body": "<p>Without Turin, Italy would be a totally different country. It was pivotal to the unification in 1861 and served as the first capital, until 1865. Its royal palaces were home to the ruling House of Savoy until the second world war and then its factories \u2013 and the influx of migrant workers they attracted \u2013 were integral to the economic miracle that rebuilt and transformed the country after it.</p> <p>Curious, then, that it is so often ignored when people talk about the best places to visit in the <em>bel </em><em>paese</em>. Italy\u2019s fourth largest city nestles in the foothills of the Alps and snowy peaks are never far from view. There are echoes of Paris along Turin\u2019s central boulevards, and though it\u2019s been more than 200 years since Napoleon\u2019s rule was replaced by the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, there are still tangible French influences to be found in the city\u2019s rich cultural and culinary traditions.</p> <p>A long period of economic decline began in the 1980s, and for decades Turin was seen as an unappealing proposition by Italian and foreign tourists alike. That sentiment changed around the time of the 2006 Winter Olympics, however, and the city has since enjoyed a period of regeneration and reinvention, filling the post-industrial vacuum with cultural and social attractions.</p> <h2>The Kappa Futurfestival, 6\u20137 July <br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6bf24475cb0c0a42be6fed9df120cb859df733a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6bf24475cb0c0a42be6fed9df120cb859df733a7/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fans at Kappa FuturFestival, Turin, Italy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>If you\u2019re into 90s rock, or want to see Ennio Morricone lead a full orchestra in an ancient Roman bath complex, then Italy is a paradise.

      "bodyText": "Without Turin, Italy would be a totally different country. It was pivotal to the unification in 1861 and served as the first capital, until 1865. Its royal palaces were home to the ruling House of Savoy until the second world war and then its factories \u2013 and the influx of migrant workers they attracted \u2013 were integral to the economic miracle that rebuilt and transformed the country after it. Curious, then, that it is so often ignored when people talk about the best places to visit in the bel paese. Italy\u2019s fourth largest city nestles in the foothills of the Alps and snowy peaks are never far from view. There are echoes of Paris along Turin\u2019s central boulevards, and though it\u2019s been more than 200 years since Napoleon\u2019s rule was replaced by the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, there are still tangible French influences to be found in the city\u2019s rich cultural and culinary traditions. A long period of economic decline began in the 1980s, and for decades Turin was seen as an unappealing proposition by Italian and foreign tourists alike. That sentiment changed around the time of the 2006 Winter Olympics, however, and the city has since enjoyed a period of regeneration and reinvention, filling the post-industrial vacuum with cultural and social attractions. The Kappa Futurfestival, 6\u20137 July If you\u2019re into 90s rock, or want to see Ennio Morricone lead a full orchestra in an ancient Roman bath complex, then Italy is a paradise. If you\u2019re into cutting-edge international acts, not so much. For fans of new music, Italy can feel like a cultural backwater at times, at least outside of Milan. Which makes the Futurfestival all the more special, because it has developed into one of Europe\u2019s major electronic music festivals. The venue alone is worth a visit. One of Turin\u2019s post-industrial marvels, the Parco Dora is a wonderful public space created from a once-derelict manufacturing area along the River Dora that was home to a Fiat steelworks and a Michelin tyre plant. It blends green areas, walkways and sports facilities with striking, fossilised elements of the old factories. Like the more famous Lingotto centre, once a Fiat factory that was so big it had a test track on its roof, the result is a vibrant, modern space that embraces the city\u2019s industrial past, rather than trying to erase it. Since the first edition in 2012, Futurfestival has developed a reputation as one for the music lovers rather than just those keen on partying, and it now attracts some of the electronic music scene\u2019s biggest acts. Highlights this year include Carl Cox, South Korea\u2019s Peggy Gou and the British-Canadian DJ Richie Hawtin. It takes place within some of the park\u2019s preserved industrial structures, running from noon until midnight each day, with 44 acts appearing across four stages. The biggest acts will play on the J\u00e4ger and Seat stages, with the Burn and Dora stages as more intimate alternatives. It is single entry each day, so no popping out for something to eat, but there will be plenty of food and drink stands on hand. Tickets are \u20ac55 for a day pass or \u20ac75 for the weekend.

Mike Bradley Jon Richardson: Ultimate Worrier 10pm, Dave This whimsical show, built in the neurotic but sharp-witted image of its host, returns for a second series. Given that Richardson has made a career out of being a fusspot, it probably shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that the format has been tweaked. The panel discussing their anxieties has expanded from two to three \u2013 kicking off with Joe Wilkinson, Kiri Pritchard-McLean and, bravely, Richardson\u2019s wife, Lucy Beaumont \u2013 and there is a new \u201cWorry Lab\u201d area to allow for extra slapstick.

Inside the Ritz Hotel 8pm, ITV Distinguished guests including the US Vogue editor Anna Wintour, the milliner Philip Treacy and actor Richard E Grant contribute to this paean to the \u201cgrande dame of Piccadilly\u201d, created in 1906. A meditation on the timelessness of a London landmark, this is a valuable addition to the growing genre of hotel TV.

Geography, geology and natural history combine in a poetic portrait of \u201cone vast ecosystem\u201d that stretches 120 miles. MB Rhys Jones: The Clues That Caught the Killer 10pm, Channel 5 In Liverpool, 2007, the 11-year-old schoolboy Rhys Jones was shot on his way home from football training. This documentary follows the investigation into his murder, exploring how police made vital breakthroughs that led to his killer\u2019s arrest, via interviews with police officers involved in the case. Ali Catterall For the People 10pm, Sky Witness Shonda Rhimes\u2019s courtroom drama opens the doors for its second season with the case of a teen gamer whose online argument may have caused a US senator\u2019s death. Sandra teams up with a new investigator to dig deeper. Meanwhile, Jay has to defend a hard-to-like young woman who faces jail for her petty crimes. Hannah Verdier Film choice The Hitch-Hiker 2.15am, Talking Pictures Ida Lupino, the Brixton-born danger-woman in thrillers such as High Sierra and They Drive by Night, moved behind the camera here to fine effect. Her taut B-movie has two friends travelling through sun-baked Mexico and stopping for a hitcher: serial killer William Talman. Bad move, boys.

She said Britain needs \u201curgent government intervention to end the epidemic\u201d and save lives.</p> <p>Excess weight causes about 1,900 more cases of bowel cancer than smoking in the UK each year. There are also 1,400 more cases of kidney cancer caused by excess weight than by smoking each year, 460 more ovarian cancers and 180 more cases of liver cancer. The warnings come as figures were released showing that the overall smoking rate has declined to 14.7%, down from 19% in 2011.

      "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018A national health crisis\u2019 Obesity rivals smoking as a cause of cancer, responsible for more cases of bowel, kidney, ovarian and liver cancer than cigarettes, according to Cancer Research UK, Britain\u2019s leading cancer charity. While smoking is still the biggest cause of cancer, the charity has warned the government to take action, as obese people outnumber smokers by two to one. \u201cAs smoking rates fall and obesity rates rise, we can clearly see the impact on a national health crisis when the government puts policies in place \u2013 and when it puts its head in the sand,\u201d said Michelle Mitchell, the charity\u2019s chief executive. She said Britain needs \u201curgent government intervention to end the epidemic\u201d and save lives. Excess weight causes about 1,900 more cases of bowel cancer than smoking in the UK each year. There are also 1,400 more cases of kidney cancer caused by excess weight than by smoking each year, 460 more ovarian cancers and 180 more cases of liver cancer. The warnings come as figures were released showing that the overall smoking rate has declined to 14.7%, down from 19% in 2011. Across the UK, 26% of adults were classified as obese in 2016, while 40% of men and 30% of women were overweight. * * * Grace Millane murder \u2013 Google has been accused of \u201cflipping the bird\u201d at New Zealand laws by refusing to change company policy after it broke suppression orders related to the murder of British backpacker Grace Millane last year. In December the name of a 27-year-old Auckland man charged with her murder was suppressed, but it appeared in Google\u2019s \u201cwhat\u2019s trending in New Zealand\u201d email that went out to thousands of subscribers. Google executives assured the New Zealand justice minister, Andrew Little, the issue would be dealt with, but this week it said it would not be making any changes. Little said the company appeared to be \u201cflipping the bird\u201d at the country\u2019s law. \u201cGoogle\u2019s contempt for New Zealand law, and for Grace Millane\u2019s family, is unacceptable and I will now be considering my options,\u201d Little said. * * * Media money \u2013 Nigel Farage is earning at least \u20ac30,000 (\u00a326,900) a month from his media company Thorn in the Side, his latest earnings declaration reveals. That\u2019s on top of pre-tax monthly MEP salary of \u20ac8,758. Farage is the sole director of the company he founded in 2011 to handle earnings from media appearances and lectures. Farage recently fell foul of the European parliament\u2019s obligation to reveal expenses after it was claimed he had failed to declare lavish gifts from the Brexit-supporting tycoon Arron Banks, including rent on a \u00a34.4m Chelsea home with fixtures and fittings, a car with a driver and a promotional tour in the US. * * * Mid-week catchup &gt; Philip Hammond has hinted he could vote against the next Tory PM and has warned of a \u00a390bn hit to finances in a no-deal Brexit. Hammond, who has made a series of increasingly forthright interventions in recent days, dropped a heavy hint on Tuesday that he would be prepared to vote against a no-deal Brexit, even if it meant breaking the party whip. It comes as Tory leadership frontrunner Boris Johnson promises to review whether so-called \u201csin stealth taxes\u201d on tobacco, alcohol and sugar are effective. &gt; A new report by the British Council has said Brexit and the difficulty of new GCSE and A-level exams have combined to put off young people from studying modern foreign languages at school. &gt; Two women will head up two of the EU\u2019s most powerful bodies, breaking with more than 60 years of male dominance. Germany\u2019s defence minister, Ursula von der Leyen, will replace Jean-Claude Juncker as president of the European Commission and France\u2019s Christine Lagarde will take over at the European Central Bank. &gt; Uber\u2019s co-founder, Garrett Camp, has bought a Los Angeles mansion $72.5m, shining a light on the city\u2019s wealth gap, and prompting criticism from drivers who have been protesting about the company\u2019s labour policies and advocating for better working conditions. \u201cDrivers are living in their cars. We\u2019re fighting for fair wages,\u201d said Nicole More, a ride-share driver in LA. &gt; The United Arab Emirates sheikh and fashion designer Khalid Al Qasimi has died at the age of 39. He was the crown prince and second son of Sheikh Dr Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, the ruler of Sharjah. Last week, Qasimi was involved in a disagreement with the Vetements brand over a replication of his 2017 T-shirt design that read \u201cDon\u2019t shoot\u201d in Arabic, French and English. * * * \u2018Shocking lack of understanding\u2019 \u2013 Race-equality thinktank the Runnymede Trust has called for lessons on migration and empire to be made compulsory in secondary schools. It says the Windrush scandal has exposed a \u201cshocking lack of understanding\u201d at government level about the winding up of the empire, and it wants to see a new approach to teaching on the subjects in schools. \u201cMigration and empire are not marginal events: they are central to our national story. As it stands the story we are telling is incomplete,\u201d the trust\u2019s new report says. Only 4% of pupils taking GCSE history choose the \u201cmigration to Britain\u201d option according to the trust\u2019s new report, yet nearly 17% \u2013 one in six \u2013 of children aged 0-15 in England and Wales are from black and minority ethnic (BME) backgrounds. BME young people make up more than one in four (27%) of state-funded primary and secondary school pupils. * * * Mystery substance \u2013 Organisers of Boston\u2019s so-called \u201cStraight Pride\u201d march have revealed that threatening envelopes posted to them that prompted calls to the police turned out to be full of nothing more hazardous than glitter. The envelopes, filled with a \u201cgranular substance\u201d, were addressed to three members of \u201cSuper Happy Fun America\u201d, a group whose membership have previously organised and attended events, some of which have turned violent and who have links to far-right figures.

It is a story told by a care home worker that touches on a taboo about dementia and sex. It is now well established that while sexuality and sexual intimacy may change with age \u2013 and dementia \u2013 they do not disappear, and positive physical relationships are good for mental health and wellbeing. With the numbers of people with dementia expected to soar from 850,000 (40,000 of them under 65) to <a href=\"https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-us/news-and-media/facts-media\" title=\"\"> more than one million by 2025</a> , the issue can no longer be allowed to hide in the shadows, campaigners argue.</p> <p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t much empirical evidence \u2013 and some care groups are more ready to talk about it than others,\u201d says Colin Capper, head of research development at the Alzheimer\u2019s Society, \u201cbut our experience is that this is a commonplace issue for care homes\u201d. As a result, it recently launched \u201c<a href=\"https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/Care-and-cure-magazine/winter-18/lift-lid-helping-care-home-staff-address-taboos\" title=\"\">Lift the Lid</a>\u201d \u2013 a resource box aimed at encouraging discussion among care workers. The <a href=\"https://www.cqc.org.uk/news/stories/new-guidance-addresses-relationships-sexuality-among-people-using-adult-social-care\" title=\"\">Care Quality Commission (CQC)</a>, which regulates residential care and the <a href=\"https://www.rcn.org.uk/professional-development/publications/pub-007126#detailTab\" title=\"\">Royal College of Nursing</a> (RCN) have both released guidance in the last year.</p> <p>No guidelines can, however, make this a simple matter, admits Dawne Garrett, the RCN professional lead on older people and dementia care (whose PhD was on sexual intimacy in older people). Consent can be complex at the best of times; never mind the uncertainties of dementia. \u201cLegally, it\u2019s a nightmare,\u201d says Garrett. On the one hand, you have an adult\u2019s human right to choose their relationships and continue to be sexual if they wish (and this includes the right to make \u201cbad\u201d decisions). On the other, there\u2019s the need to ensure sexual activity is consensual and protect vulnerable people from abuse.</p> <p>The core problem, says Alex Ruck Keene, a barrister specialising in mental capacity, is the clash between these \u201ctwo competing policy goals \u2013 both absolutely laudable and absolutely incompatible\u201d.</p> <p>The law is, in one sense, very clear: sexual activity (a broad term that can cover everything from intercourse to kissing) requires consent. This involves being able to understand what you are consenting to and communicating this at the relevant moment. Sexual relations are explicitly excluded from the best interests test so nobody \u2013 not even with legal power of attorney \u2013 can consent for you.</p> <p>\u201cNone of us would want a world in which consent is not essential,\u201d says Ruck Keene. \u201cImagine what could happen in a dodgy care home.\u201d</p> <p>But he adds: \u201cThis does mean the law can be very harsh.\u201d If you\u2019ve been married for 50 years, for instance, then one of you gets dementia and is deemed not to have capacity, continuing a sexual relationship makes the healthy partner technically a sex offender, he points out.

      "bodyText": "Frank and Mary loved each other\u2019s company. They would sit together and hold hands. Both had dementia and were living in a care home. Their closeness made them happy and their families were delighted. Mary wasn\u2019t bothered when Frank called her by his wife\u2019s name, nor that he began to intervene in her day-to-day life. They were besotted. He started sitting her on his knee, and, after a few drinks, they could be found canoodling in the corner. This is not a fictional scenario. It is a story told by a care home worker that touches on a taboo about dementia and sex. It is now well established that while sexuality and sexual intimacy may change with age \u2013 and dementia \u2013 they do not disappear, and positive physical relationships are good for mental health and wellbeing. With the numbers of people with dementia expected to soar from 850,000 (40,000 of them under 65) to more than one million by 2025 , the issue can no longer be allowed to hide in the shadows, campaigners argue. \u201cThere isn\u2019t much empirical evidence \u2013 and some care groups are more ready to talk about it than others,\u201d says Colin Capper, head of research development at the Alzheimer\u2019s Society, \u201cbut our experience is that this is a commonplace issue for care homes\u201d. As a result, it recently launched \u201cLift the Lid\u201d \u2013 a resource box aimed at encouraging discussion among care workers. The Care Quality Commission (CQC), which regulates residential care and the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) have both released guidance in the last year. No guidelines can, however, make this a simple matter, admits Dawne Garrett, the RCN professional lead on older people and dementia care (whose PhD was on sexual intimacy in older people). Consent can be complex at the best of times; never mind the uncertainties of dementia. \u201cLegally, it\u2019s a nightmare,\u201d says Garrett. On the one hand, you have an adult\u2019s human right to choose their relationships and continue to be sexual if they wish (and this includes the right to make \u201cbad\u201d decisions). On the other, there\u2019s the need to ensure sexual activity is consensual and protect vulnerable people from abuse. The core problem, says Alex Ruck Keene, a barrister specialising in mental capacity, is the clash between these \u201ctwo competing policy goals \u2013 both absolutely laudable and absolutely incompatible\u201d. The law is, in one sense, very clear: sexual activity (a broad term that can cover everything from intercourse to kissing) requires consent. This involves being able to understand what you are consenting to and communicating this at the relevant moment. Sexual relations are explicitly excluded from the best interests test so nobody \u2013 not even with legal power of attorney \u2013 can consent for you. \u201cNone of us would want a world in which consent is not essential,\u201d says Ruck Keene. \u201cImagine what could happen in a dodgy care home.\u201d But he adds: \u201cThis does mean the law can be very harsh.\u201d If you\u2019ve been married for 50 years, for instance, then one of you gets dementia and is deemed not to have capacity, continuing a sexual relationship makes the healthy partner technically a sex offender, he points out. But, if both partners lack capacity, they are legally safe, though an enabling care home worker could still find themselves in breach of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. The public nature of life in a care home adds another layer of complexity to this normally private matter, says Esther Wiskerke, who trains care home staff about dementia and sexuality. Sexual attitudes are deeply, culturally and religiously ingrained and a simple (totally unsexual) touching exercise between participants in one of her training sessions in a care home in Kent quickly reveals personal differences. Care workers need to be very conscious of their own beliefs to ensure they don\u2019t affect residents, says Wiskerke. \u201cWhether someone can carry on a relationship should not depend on who is on shift.\u201d Everyone who is attending her training session, hosted by family-run Hallmark Care Homes, has first-hand experience and stories ricochet about the room. Many include the difficulty of dealing with the residents\u2019 families \u2013 usually their children (rarely the best people to consult about a person\u2019s sexuality) who are frequently also paying the bills. Some carers feel they have to take relatives\u2019 views very seriously, others say, \u201cit isn\u2019t about them \u2013 it\u2019s about the resident\u201d. One carer says she is (unusually, she adds) about to take a resident out to buy a vibrator and that, no, she will not be mentioning this to the woman\u2019s daughter. In the case of Frank and Mary, their adult offspring found their parents\u2019 increasingly intimate relationship disturbing. A meeting was called and the decision made to separate them \u2013 moving him to another floor. \u201cIt destroyed her,\u201d Millie, then a young care worker at the home, tells the other participants. \u201cShe became really challenging. It was so cruel. We had no idea how to handle it. There was no training, no support. We failed them. It was awful, awful for everyone.\u201d So how can older people with dementia be allowed to have relationships without weakening the law that protects them? First, says Ruck Keene, we need to bear in mind that, \u201cthe [legal] bar for capacity to consent to sexual relations is deliberately set quite low\u201d. Nobody wants to \u201cbarge in and interfere\u201d if it isn\u2019t necessary, and mental capacity is specific to each behaviour so just because you can\u2019t handle your own bank account or run your own bath, doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t consent to sexual relations. The CQC guidance is clear: people with dementia \u201ccan, and do consent to sexual relations\u201d and care homes will now be judged on allowing and \u2013 in the right circumstances - supporting them to do so. Care home staff do have to be vigilant and notice non-verbal signs of discomfort, says Wiskerke. If in doubt, she adds, it\u2019s time to call in the multi-disciplinary team to assess and collectively decide what is best. \u201cManagers need to have big shoulders and not be too risk-averse,\u201d says Ruck Keene. \u201cIt is clearly not in the public interest for the Crown Prosecution Service to prosecute in the case of a loving relationship where nobody believes there is any problem, even though it is technically breaking the law.\u201d But the fear that this could happen may distort how institutions treat their residents.

Ruck Keene is involved in a project exploring whether the law should be changed to enable a person with deteriorating cognitive ability who is in a long-term relationship, to provide some kind of conditional advance consent to intimacy with the existing partner. He admits it is not proving easy. While the legal situation may be far from perfect, the only way forward is to break open this taboo and talk honestly, discuss, train, share best practice, and take each case on its merits, mapping the best path through this intimate minefield.

Look around boutique gyms, co-working spaces for the creative industries and stylish bars, and you will see women \u2013 mostly in their 20s and 30s \u2013 with intricately pierced ears.</p> <p>They may have four gold hoops hanging in a single lobe, diamond bars \u201cstacked\u201d along their cartilage, or a skull-shaped stud glimmering from their antitragus. They\u2019re all fans of the \u201ccurated ear\u201d \u2013 a craze for multiple ear piercings, in unusual placements \u2013 that has arguably replaced tattoos as the body adornment du jour. Although some men are also getting in on the act, this particular piercings trend is predominately led by young women, although reliable data on the subject is hard to come by. A <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/336/7658/1426.full#REF5\" title=\"\">2008 study</a> found that nearly half of women in England aged 16-24 had piercings at sites other than the earlobe (this included sites elsewhere on the body). By comparison, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/oct/26/how-tattoos-went-from-subculture-to-pop-culture\" title=\"\">2015 British study</a> found that 30% of 25- to 39-year-olds have at least one tattoo. According to the US piercing studio Infinite Body Piercing, the five most popular ear placements in 2017 were lobes, followed by the outer helix (the upper cartilage of the ear), tragus (the piece of skin immediately in front of the ear canal), conch (the inner part of the ear itself), and forward helix (the piece of cartilage above the ear canal, where the ear meets the face).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"68673ba8dff3a425fa3fa6a1024c06d8a7b0624b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68673ba8dff3a425fa3fa6a1024c06d8a7b0624b/0_178_3056_3817/801.jpg\" alt=\"Zo\u00eb Kravitz attending the Met Gala in May 2018\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zo\u00eb Kravitz attending the Met Gala in May 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So what is the appeal? \u201cThere was a good portion of my life where I was dunking my ears in salt water for most of an evening,\u201d says Caitlin Quinlan, a 23-year-old who works in the film industry. She has 10 piercings across both of her ears, all in gold. \u201cI get a few compliments on my ears, and I always really like it, because I feel like I\u2019ve achieved something \u2013 I\u2019ve curated my ears, and it\u2019s nice that people notice it.\u201d</p> <p>Another ear-piercing fan says: \u201cI think I just need the rush every six months of having a stranger stab me with something very sharp in a safe and controlled environment.\u201d </p> <p>Humans have been piercing their ears for thousands of years \u2013 bronze age frescoes depicting women wearing hoop earrings can be found on the Greek island of Santorini \u2013 but the craze for multiple piercings, often using fine metals and precious stones, is a more modern phenomenon. </p> <p>One of its early proponents was Maria Tash, an American jeweller and piercer to the stars. Living in San Francisco and Los Angeles in the early 90s, she watched body piercings became fashionable. Piercers would typically use titanium jewellery with little adornment, but Tash would customise her piercings by popping a rose gold bead into a plain ring, or anodising wire into different colours. She opened her first boutique in New York in 2004; since then, she has created a <a href=\"https://www.mariatash.com/\" title=\"\">global piercing empire</a>. In addition to two London outposts, Tash has studios in Rome, Dublin and Dubai, and her celebrity fans including Rihanna and Zo\u00eb Kravitz (Rihanna has worn a diamond stud in her helix, and a ring in her third lobe; Kravitz has her tragus pierced, as well as other body parts).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9d0ec1bd8254190d48370b6a5201580a52386936\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d0ec1bd8254190d48370b6a5201580a52386936/0_657_3079_3077/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ear jewellery from Astrid & Miyu\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ear jewellery, such as this from Astrid &amp; Miyu, is increasingly popular</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A Maria Tash ear does not come cheap: prices range from \u00a342 for a simple gold threaded stud, to \u00a35,890 for a pear-shaped diamond. As they are designed to be \u201cstacked\u201d in an ear, getting the look can run to thousands of pounds.</p> <p>\u201cThe curated ear is my philosophy of how we enhance a client\u2019s beauty through layering jewellery on the ear,\u201d says Tash. \u201cWe look very closely at the anatomy, skin tone \u2026 any scars or asymmetric features.\u201d</p> <p>The most popular trends Tash is encountering include a \u201cstacked lobe\u201d, with ear piercings that go above and are parallel to first and second lobe piercings, and a \u201chigh conch\u201d piercing, in the upper, flat part of the ear. Walking the streets of Manhattan, Tash sees her influence in many passing ears.</p> <p>\u201cMy eyes gravitate to things,\u201d she says. \u201cI think: \u2018Oh, that\u2019s a crappy placement, or that\u2019s beautiful, or that\u2019s my stone.\u2019 It\u2019s great.\u201d</p> <p>Tash isn\u2019t the only big-name piercer in the game. In much the same way that tattoo artists have become celebrities in their own right, some of the most celebrated piercers have huge social media followings, and lengthy waiting lists. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bentauber/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Ben Tauber</a>, for example, has more than 56,000 Instagram followers, while <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jcolbysmith/?hl=en\" title=\"\">J Colby Smith</a> is known for piercing the fashion and media glitterati in Brooklyn and Los Angeles.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3dcc30a115d0dde939220556667ffefde97c3dc4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3dcc30a115d0dde939220556667ffefde97c3dc4/0_0_1158_1158/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ear jewellery from Maria Tash\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ear jewellery from Maria Tash</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the UK, <a href=\"https://www.astridandmiyu.com\" title=\"\">Astrid &amp; Miyu</a> offers gold-plated body jewellery, which is ideal for achieving the curated ear look at a lower cost. It markets itself as the UK\u2019s \u201cmost Instagrammable piercing studio\u201d and has two shops in London, although it recently ran a month-long pop-up in the Bullring in Birmingham and has plans to open a concession in the Selfridges in the Trafford Centre in Manchester later this year.</p> <p>\u201cWe wanted to make ear stacking and mixing up your ear jewellery more accessible, by making it affordable without compromising on quality,\u201d says Sophie Williams, the company\u2019s brand marketing associate. It was obviously a savvy business move; Astrid &amp; Miyu is growing 200% year on year.</p> <p>At least part of the popularity of multiple ear piercings may be down to the fact that they are a low-effort, reversible alternative to tattoos. Like inking, curated ears are seen as subversive, but they can also be worn every day. And they are a form of body modification that appeals to those wary of making long-term commitments. \u201cThe thing that has always been powerful about piercing is that you can take it out and you can change it as your mood dictates,\u201d says Tash. And it is less of an undertaking, as Lucy Halligan, a 21-year-old PA from London, says. She adds that she got her 15 ear piercings \u201cbecause I was too scared to get a tattoo\u201d.</p> <p>Social media has also accelerated the trend. Browse the hashtag \u201ccurated ear\u201d on Instagram and you will see thousands of posts. Brands such as <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bynouck_jewelry/?hl=en\" title=\"\">By Nouck</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jcojewellery/?hl=en\" title=\"\">J&amp;Co Jewellery</a> use the platform as their predominant means of marketing. </p> <p>\u201cCustomers use platforms such as Instagram to inspire a whole new look for their ear,\u201d says Williams, who adds that daith (a hoop of skin in the inner ear) and helix piercings are very popular now. Another reason why the curated ear may be so popular is because it is low-effort but also chic. Once you have forked out for the jewellery \u2013 and endured the twice-daily saline soaks needed for your piercings to heal \u2013 you are set. You don\u2019t have to change your earrings, or match them to your outfit as you might with single lobe piercings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9765fbcb6f396e38458d3d71ca9bb4f4d1f54fb2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9765fbcb6f396e38458d3d71ca9bb4f4d1f54fb2/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Some of the ear jewellery on offer at Astrid & Miyu\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some of the ear jewellery on offer at Astrid &amp; Miyu</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the mania for piercings isn\u2019t risk-free. After Halligan got her rook pierced in February, it got infected. \u201cThere\u2019s no pain that can describe your cartilage swelling,\u201d she says, grimacing. Halligan spent three days in hospital on an antibiotic drip. While there, hospital staff removed all her other piercings.</p> <p>\u201cI could hear all of the little barbells dropping into a pot. I kept thinking: \u2018That\u2019s 20 quid.\u2019 I was so upset.\u201d Had Halligan not sought medical help, however, the infection could have spread to her brain.</p> <p>For now, it looks likely that the piercing trend isn\u2019t going away. And, despite everything, Halligan would consider getting more piercings. She says there is a woman at her work who has her conch pierced, and Halligan finds herself looking at it enviously. \u201cIt looks so nice. Every time I say it, everyone\u2019s like: \u2018Not this again.\u2019\u201d </p>",

      "bodyText": "Conch, rook, helix, daith: these words won\u2019t mean anything to most people, but to an army of voguish women, they are immediately recognisable as the parts of the ear that can be pierced. Look around boutique gyms, co-working spaces for the creative industries and stylish bars, and you will see women \u2013 mostly in their 20s and 30s \u2013 with intricately pierced ears. They may have four gold hoops hanging in a single lobe, diamond bars \u201cstacked\u201d along their cartilage, or a skull-shaped stud glimmering from their antitragus. They\u2019re all fans of the \u201ccurated ear\u201d \u2013 a craze for multiple ear piercings, in unusual placements \u2013 that has arguably replaced tattoos as the body adornment du jour. Although some men are also getting in on the act, this particular piercings trend is predominately led by young women, although reliable data on the subject is hard to come by. A 2008 study found that nearly half of women in England aged 16-24 had piercings at sites other than the earlobe (this included sites elsewhere on the body). By comparison, a 2015 British study found that 30% of 25- to 39-year-olds have at least one tattoo. According to the US piercing studio Infinite Body Piercing, the five most popular ear placements in 2017 were lobes, followed by the outer helix (the upper cartilage of the ear), tragus (the piece of skin immediately in front of the ear canal), conch (the inner part of the ear itself), and forward helix (the piece of cartilage above the ear canal, where the ear meets the face). So what is the appeal? \u201cThere was a good portion of my life where I was dunking my ears in salt water for most of an evening,\u201d says Caitlin Quinlan, a 23-year-old who works in the film industry. She has 10 piercings across both of her ears, all in gold. \u201cI get a few compliments on my ears, and I always really like it, because I feel like I\u2019ve achieved something \u2013 I\u2019ve curated my ears, and it\u2019s nice that people notice it.\u201d Another ear-piercing fan says: \u201cI think I just need the rush every six months of having a stranger stab me with something very sharp in a safe and controlled environment.\u201d Humans have been piercing their ears for thousands of years \u2013 bronze age frescoes depicting women wearing hoop earrings can be found on the Greek island of Santorini \u2013 but the craze for multiple piercings, often using fine metals and precious stones, is a more modern phenomenon. One of its early proponents was Maria Tash, an American jeweller and piercer to the stars. Living in San Francisco and Los Angeles in the early 90s, she watched body piercings became fashionable. Piercers would typically use titanium jewellery with little adornment, but Tash would customise her piercings by popping a rose gold bead into a plain ring, or anodising wire into different colours. She opened her first boutique in New York in 2004; since then, she has created a global piercing empire. In addition to two London outposts, Tash has studios in Rome, Dublin and Dubai, and her celebrity fans including Rihanna and Zo\u00eb Kravitz (Rihanna has worn a diamond stud in her helix, and a ring in her third lobe; Kravitz has her tragus pierced, as well as other body parts). A Maria Tash ear does not come cheap: prices range from \u00a342 for a simple gold threaded stud, to \u00a35,890 for a pear-shaped diamond. As they are designed to be \u201cstacked\u201d in an ear, getting the look can run to thousands of pounds. \u201cThe curated ear is my philosophy of how we enhance a client\u2019s beauty through layering jewellery on the ear,\u201d says Tash. \u201cWe look very closely at the anatomy, skin tone \u2026 any scars or asymmetric features.\u201d The most popular trends Tash is encountering include a \u201cstacked lobe\u201d, with ear piercings that go above and are parallel to first and second lobe piercings, and a \u201chigh conch\u201d piercing, in the upper, flat part of the ear. Walking the streets of Manhattan, Tash sees her influence in many passing ears. \u201cMy eyes gravitate to things,\u201d she says. \u201cI think: \u2018Oh, that\u2019s a crappy placement, or that\u2019s beautiful, or that\u2019s my stone.\u2019 It\u2019s great.\u201d Tash isn\u2019t the only big-name piercer in the game. In much the same way that tattoo artists have become celebrities in their own right, some of the most celebrated piercers have huge social media followings, and lengthy waiting lists. Ben Tauber, for example, has more than 56,000 Instagram followers, while J Colby Smith is known for piercing the fashion and media glitterati in Brooklyn and Los Angeles. In the UK, Astrid &amp; Miyu offers gold-plated body jewellery, which is ideal for achieving the curated ear look at a lower cost. It markets itself as the UK\u2019s \u201cmost Instagrammable piercing studio\u201d and has two shops in London, although it recently ran a month-long pop-up in the Bullring in Birmingham and has plans to open a concession in the Selfridges in the Trafford Centre in Manchester later this year. \u201cWe wanted to make ear stacking and mixing up your ear jewellery more accessible, by making it affordable without compromising on quality,\u201d says Sophie Williams, the company\u2019s brand marketing associate. It was obviously a savvy business move; Astrid &amp; Miyu is growing 200% year on year. At least part of the popularity of multiple ear piercings may be down to the fact that they are a low-effort, reversible alternative to tattoos. Like inking, curated ears are seen as subversive, but they can also be worn every day. And they are a form of body modification that appeals to those wary of making long-term commitments. \u201cThe thing that has always been powerful about piercing is that you can take it out and you can change it as your mood dictates,\u201d says Tash. And it is less of an undertaking, as Lucy Halligan, a 21-year-old PA from London, says. She adds that she got her 15 ear piercings \u201cbecause I was too scared to get a tattoo\u201d. Social media has also accelerated the trend. Browse the hashtag \u201ccurated ear\u201d on Instagram and you will see thousands of posts. Brands such as By Nouck and J&amp;Co Jewellery use the platform as their predominant means of marketing. \u201cCustomers use platforms such as Instagram to inspire a whole new look for their ear,\u201d says Williams, who adds that daith (a hoop of skin in the inner ear) and helix piercings are very popular now. Another reason why the curated ear may be so popular is because it is low-effort but also chic. Once you have forked out for the jewellery \u2013 and endured the twice-daily saline soaks needed for your piercings to heal \u2013 you are set. You don\u2019t have to change your earrings, or match them to your outfit as you might with single lobe piercings. But the mania for piercings isn\u2019t risk-free. After Halligan got her rook pierced in February, it got infected. \u201cThere\u2019s no pain that can describe your cartilage swelling,\u201d she says, grimacing. Halligan spent three days in hospital on an antibiotic drip. While there, hospital staff removed all her other piercings. \u201cI could hear all of the little barbells dropping into a pot. I kept thinking: \u2018That\u2019s 20 quid.\u2019 I was so upset.\u201d Had Halligan not sought medical help, however, the infection could have spread to her brain. For now, it looks likely that the piercing trend isn\u2019t going away. And, despite everything, Halligan would consider getting more piercings. She says there is a woman at her work who has her conch pierced, and Halligan finds herself looking at it enviously. \u201cIt looks so nice. Every time I say it, everyone\u2019s like: \u2018Not this again.\u2019\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Can you burp? Not even on command \u2013 just, for instance, have you burped at all in 2019?</p> <p>While belching is characterized as a day-to-day bodily function, for an unknown number of people, it\u2019s a relief they never experience.</p> <p>Instead, a big meal or carbonated beverage sets off a chain of gastric unpleasantries: bloating, searing pain in the esophagus, and excessive flatulence. And of course, the gurgling, a sound reminiscent of croaking frogs that seems to come from the throat.</p> <p>There\u2019s no medical term for people who can\u2019t burp, and the amount of scientific studies on the missing body function can be counted on one hand. But after years of being ignored by the medical establishment, the no-burpers have now taken things into their own hands.</p> <p>In March, Robert Bastian, an ear, nose and throat doctor at Bastian Voice Institute, published <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2473974X19834553\">the first known research article</a> to recognize the lack of burping as a condition, and to advocate for the use of Botox to treat these patients. For the last four years, his office had been stormed by people who learned online that he had successfully helped one person burp and demanded the same procedure.</p> <p>The first patient, a man from Dallas, contacted Bastian in 2015 in a desperate search for help after finding his <a href=\"https://laryngopedia.com/about-us/who-we-are/\">website about illness and injury to the larynx</a>. Bastian often deals with disorders of the sphincters \u2013 the muscle rings that open and close in the esophagus \u2013 and floated a treatment idea: a Botox injection. \u201cI was simply using deductive reasoning based on what he told me because I had never encountered it before,\u201d Bastian said.</p> <p>The man replied that he wanted to travel immediately to Bastian\u2019s office in the suburbs of Chicago to try the treatment. Bastian told the patient travel wouldn\u2019t be necessary because so many doctors were licensed to provide the injections across the country, but the man, traveled for the injection anyway. </p> <p>He managed to burp right away, then wrote about his experience on r/noburp, a community on the social media website Reddit, without Bastian\u2019s knowledge. Since then, more than 170 people have gone to Bastian for the injection.</p> <p>For many no-burpers, the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/noburp/\">r/noburp</a> community is where users find both hope and solace. There, people suggest vocal exercises such as those done by singers to train people to burp, or offer tips on medicine that provides relief. Users swap stories of doctors who don\u2019t take them seriously, and about getting treatment from the doctors who do. Posts such as <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/noburp/comments/bar213/i_spent_spring_break_burping_back_to_a_no_burp_now/\">I spent spring break burping!

It wasn\u2019t until her early 20s, when she started drinking and going out, that she realized it could be connected to the pain and bloating that often interrupted boozy nights. She would gurgle and feel like her stomach was a balloon that had been tied up at the top.</p> <p>It was a significant enough problem that she brought it up with a doctor, who told her it was a problem only she had. Then she found r/noburp.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been uplifting, to know I\u2019m not the only one that deals with this, that there are cures or ways to deal with it to make it less uncomfortable and just to be able to commiserate with this community of people that I didn\u2019t even realize existed,\u201d she said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It's been uplifting to just to be able to commiserate with this community of people that I didn't even realize existed</p> <footer> <cite>@i-like-tea</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As traffic picked up in the forum last year, @i-like-tea decided to conduct a comprehensive survey incorporating topics and issues raised in the group. There were 789 respondents.</p> <p>Of those surveyed, 88% said they experienced bloating, 87.5% experienced gurgling and 80% experienced excessive flatulence. After that, the remaining symptoms only applied to 54% of the group or less. Only 19.9% of those surveyed, for instance, said they had experienced a \u201ccough-burp\u201d.</p> <p>The group was also surveyed on what they felt triggered their symptoms and on the methods they had used to relieve discomfort and pain, including a suggestion to \u201cvomit air\u201d in a bathroom and to eat smaller, more frequent meals.</p> <p>As for @i-like-tea\u2019s own burp journey, every couple of months she\u2019ll \u201csqueak out\u201d a burp, up from the usual pattern of a couple times per year. She is doing this by being more mindful when she gets the gurgles.</p> <p>She has also been approached by a doctor who saw her survey while trying to figure out why one of his patients couldn\u2019t burp. He is hoping to use her research to fuel his own study. \u201cIt is promising that they [r/noburp] are able to get recognition for a condition that nobody else cared about,\u201d she said.</p> <p> @i-like-tea also warned that self-diagnosis can be dangerous, which is why she is reluctant to spend too much time searching online for information about no-burp.

      "bodyText": "Can you burp? Not even on command \u2013 just, for instance, have you burped at all in 2019? While belching is characterized as a day-to-day bodily function, for an unknown number of people, it\u2019s a relief they never experience. Instead, a big meal or carbonated beverage sets off a chain of gastric unpleasantries: bloating, searing pain in the esophagus, and excessive flatulence. And of course, the gurgling, a sound reminiscent of croaking frogs that seems to come from the throat. There\u2019s no medical term for people who can\u2019t burp, and the amount of scientific studies on the missing body function can be counted on one hand. But after years of being ignored by the medical establishment, the no-burpers have now taken things into their own hands. In March, Robert Bastian, an ear, nose and throat doctor at Bastian Voice Institute, published the first known research article to recognize the lack of burping as a condition, and to advocate for the use of Botox to treat these patients. For the last four years, his office had been stormed by people who learned online that he had successfully helped one person burp and demanded the same procedure. The first patient, a man from Dallas, contacted Bastian in 2015 in a desperate search for help after finding his website about illness and injury to the larynx. Bastian often deals with disorders of the sphincters \u2013 the muscle rings that open and close in the esophagus \u2013 and floated a treatment idea: a Botox injection. \u201cI was simply using deductive reasoning based on what he told me because I had never encountered it before,\u201d Bastian said. The man replied that he wanted to travel immediately to Bastian\u2019s office in the suburbs of Chicago to try the treatment. Bastian told the patient travel wouldn\u2019t be necessary because so many doctors were licensed to provide the injections across the country, but the man, traveled for the injection anyway. He managed to burp right away, then wrote about his experience on r/noburp, a community on the social media website Reddit, without Bastian\u2019s knowledge. Since then, more than 170 people have gone to Bastian for the injection. For many no-burpers, the r/noburp community is where users find both hope and solace. There, people suggest vocal exercises such as those done by singers to train people to burp, or offer tips on medicine that provides relief. Users swap stories of doctors who don\u2019t take them seriously, and about getting treatment from the doctors who do. Posts such as I spent spring break burping! Back to a no burp now or Here\u2019s how i learned to Burp (Ongoing Burp-Log), include temporary tweaks that seem to help. No-burpers, such as 26-year-old Canadian engineer-in-training @i-like-tea, usually find the community while searching online for an explanation about why they gurgle after drinking soda, or feel bloated for a full day after one meal. @i-like-tea, who chose to use her Reddit name so people wouldn\u2019t know her real-life identity, always knew she couldn\u2019t burp. It wasn\u2019t until her early 20s, when she started drinking and going out, that she realized it could be connected to the pain and bloating that often interrupted boozy nights. She would gurgle and feel like her stomach was a balloon that had been tied up at the top. It was a significant enough problem that she brought it up with a doctor, who told her it was a problem only she had. Then she found r/noburp. \u201cIt\u2019s been uplifting, to know I\u2019m not the only one that deals with this, that there are cures or ways to deal with it to make it less uncomfortable and just to be able to commiserate with this community of people that I didn\u2019t even realize existed,\u201d she said. As traffic picked up in the forum last year, @i-like-tea decided to conduct a comprehensive survey incorporating topics and issues raised in the group. There were 789 respondents. Of those surveyed, 88% said they experienced bloating, 87.5% experienced gurgling and 80% experienced excessive flatulence. After that, the remaining symptoms only applied to 54% of the group or less. Only 19.9% of those surveyed, for instance, said they had experienced a \u201ccough-burp\u201d. The group was also surveyed on what they felt triggered their symptoms and on the methods they had used to relieve discomfort and pain, including a suggestion to \u201cvomit air\u201d in a bathroom and to eat smaller, more frequent meals. As for @i-like-tea\u2019s own burp journey, every couple of months she\u2019ll \u201csqueak out\u201d a burp, up from the usual pattern of a couple times per year. She is doing this by being more mindful when she gets the gurgles. She has also been approached by a doctor who saw her survey while trying to figure out why one of his patients couldn\u2019t burp. He is hoping to use her research to fuel his own study. \u201cIt is promising that they [r/noburp] are able to get recognition for a condition that nobody else cared about,\u201d she said. @i-like-tea also warned that self-diagnosis can be dangerous, which is why she is reluctant to spend too much time searching online for information about no-burp. At the same time, she was surprised by how severely people in the survey said not burping was affecting their lives. \u201cI do think a lot of people will self-diagnose themselves with things and then address it in ways that aren\u2019t prudent,\u201d she said. \u201cBut also, a lot of the survey responses I\u2019ve got are people saying this is ruining my life.\u201d Dr Bastian said he has treated patients who made extreme life adjustments because of the condition \u2013 one woman who would eat at work, then leave her office and lie down in her car because of the pain she would experience. A university student he spoke with said he wouldn\u2019t eat for the first six hours of each day because he didn\u2019t want to get gurgles in class. Bastian\u2019s article focused on the first 51 people who had the Botox injection, since more than six months had elapsed since they had the injection when he was preparing the paper. Patients came from 20 states and three foreign countries. All 51 people were able to belch after the injection, though 11 lost the ability between eight and 20 weeks after the injection. Four of that group returned for another injection. There are now four more doctors r/noburp trusts to provide the procedure in the UK, Canada and the US, but Bastian hopes it will one day be much more. Ever since that first patient, he has been inundated with messages from no-burpers. The article published in March is a formalized version of an email text he sends to no-burpers looking for more information. He deliberately published it in an open-source publication so it wouldn\u2019t be stuck behind a paywall. Because he is busy treating patients with other disorders, he hopes by putting his initial work out, other doctors will do the treatment themselves or do more research into why people can\u2019t burp. Bastian sees his experience with the no-burpers as a reminder to the medical community that anecdote can be a powerful basis to develop science. He repeatedly emphasized that he encourages everyone to use the information they find in concert with their doctor, but defended how the internet can help people become better-informed patients. Bastian said: \u201cIt [the internet] is a bad thing if you\u2019re talking about actual diagnosis and treatment, but to serve as a way to alert and to give people a concept or to expand their consciousness or to give them another question to ask their physician is a very good thing.\u201d",

Iva Nevoralova, the orchestra\u2019s spokesperson, likened the request to the actions of Czechoslovakia\u2019s former communist regime, which pressured artists to denounce Havel\u2019s dissident Charter 77 movement as the price for being allowed to perform. Speaking to the Guardian, H\u0159ib questioned whether Prague\u2019s arrangement with Beijing was a fair relationship and criticised China\u2019s \u201csocial scoring\u201d system for good citizenship. He suggested that investment from Taiwan, with its western-style democracy and record of technological innovation, offered greater benefit. The mayor has won praise for restoring the Czech Republic\u2019s image as a champion of human rights and self-determination at a time when its politics have been dominated by the populist messages of Zeman and Andrej Babi\u0161, the anti-immigration billionaire prime minister. \u201cIt is empowering to see that a mayor of Prague can have a principled position, despite large portions of the Czech political establishment being co-opted by the narratives spread by the totalitarian government of China,\u201d said Jakub Janda, executive director of the European Values thinktank, which monitors anti-western influence in Czech politics and beyond. Ji\u0159\u00ed Pehe, the director of New York University in Prague, said H\u0159ib was using the mayor\u2019s office to reassert the values of Havel, who died in 2011. \u201cEveryone in this country knows that when you support Taiwan and Tibet, you\u2019re saying exactly what Havel used to say,\u201d said Pehe. \u201cThis was intentional on the part of the Pirate party as soon as he took over Prague. They are saying that the Czech Republic has a special history of fighting against communism and you should respect it.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

      "body": "<p>You know what you\u2019re supposed to think of Boris Johnson. He is a cynical joker, a blond wrecking ball spouting Latin, an overprivileged preposteropath. He is a politician to be opposed fiercely, yet never taken seriously.</p> <p>Look at the tools with which journalists are covering his leadership campaign. Dollops of scepticism about his Brexit plans, a few questions about that dodgy past \u2013 and a vast yawning incuriosity about any of his other policies. You can see why that is: when one has a star so box office and a show as dramatic as Britain crashing out of Europe within a few months, then who cares about the support acts? Especially if one doubts the Bullingdon buffoon is even capable of having policies. Still, this is an astonishingly easy ride to give a man probably just three weeks away from becoming our next prime minister.</p> <p>It also hugely underestimates the former foreign secretary and the seriousness of the threat he now poses to our way of life. The area that has given me most pause over the past few days is the one that many of my colleagues have greeted with the greatest derision: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/01/do-spending-plans-of-boris-johnson-and-jeremy-hunt-add-up-brexit\" title=\"\">Johnson\u2019s outlining of his economic plans</a>. I see their absurdity, yet they do not make me laugh. Are they ridiculous? No doubt. Reckless? Of course. But could they help him secure power and forever alter Britain? Sadly, I believe they could.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Theresa May's would-be replacement has found not just one magic money tree, but a whole forest</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On early showing, Boris-onomics may be rife with intellectual contradictions, but politically it is utterly cogent \u2013 and the Tory hard right no longer seeks starred firsts, but state power. What they are putting together is a package both to buy enough of a public mandate for a no-deal Brexit, and then to rip up what remains of Britain\u2019s tattered social contract between workers, employers and the state. More worryingly, I cannot yet see anything like a sufficient response either from the Labour opposition or among the disparate groups that claim to speak for remain.</p> <p>What is the big difference between Johnson\u2019s economics and that practised by his former colleagues in government? In a word, cash \u2013 and lots of it. In the 2017 general election, Theresa May famously told a struggling nurse that there was no \u201c<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-nurse-magic-money-tree-bbcqt-question-time-pay-rise-eight-years-election-latest-a7770576.html\" title=\"\">magic money tree</a>\u201d to give her a pay rise. Her would-be replacement has found not just one tree, but a whole forest. Pay rises for public-sector workers! Fewer workers paying national insurance! Tax cuts for the rich! And that\u2019s just for starters.</p> <p>As mayor of London, Johnson was mad about infrastructure, never happier than when strapped into a hard hat. He <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/04/09/garden-bridge-cost-taxpayer-50m-failure-charity-undermines-public/\" title=\"\">spaffed tens of millions</a> on a garden bridge across the Thames and dreamed of erecting an airport on an estuary island. If he becomes prime minister, he will almost certainly unleash the biggest public-works programme seen this decade. You can imagine him now, performing Churchill to the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg and her camera operator on building sites across the country; or driving a crane while reciting Tacitus. High-speed rail and superfast broadband everywhere! Nuclear power stations! Airport runways! Much of this could be announced as soon as an emergency budget in September, since his team say they want the economy \u201cgoing gangbusters\u201d by 31 October, just as the government bellyflops out of the EU.</p> <p>Ah, you may say. Ah, but those are just more promises from the man who paraded himself in front of a lying bus. True, except every one of the serious contenders for the Tory leadership carried their own huge blank cheque. The last challenger standing, the supposed moderate Jeremy Hunt, has actually pledged greater spending commitments than Johnson. And, little noticed at Westminster, Nigel Farage this week made his first policy pledge for the Brexit party: <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7197271/Farage-plots-200-BILLION-plan-rebuild-regions-outside-London.html\" title=\"\">a \u00a3200bn bung</a> for everywhere outside London.</p> <p>This tells you two things. First, that the two figureheads of no-deal politics, Farage and Johnson, are now in an open bidding war to buy up the Labour leave constituencies. Johnson is pitching himself as the Tory who can see off Farage and Jeremy Corbyn: he will keep on promising to spend public millions to keep his party in government. And he may have some success: polling from January this year showed that only 36% of Labour leave voters list Brexit as a top-three issue for them or their families. Far higher rank the economy, austerity and welfare cuts.</p> <p>Second, that four years after Corbyn made Labour an anti-cuts party, Britain is finally entering a post-austerity era. After nearly a decade of teaching assistants resorting to food banks, of council services getting cut to the bone, and of homeless people lining our streets, the contrast will be so sharp as to be painful. When Ramsay MacDonald\u2019s government finally devalued the pound in 1931 and the much-foretold chaos didn\u2019t break out, a Labour stalwart remarked in bewilderment: \u201cNobody told us we could do that.\u201d And when Britain finally breaks with austerity, there will settle over Whitehall and town halls across the country a similar stunned amazement. But the big lesson from this is that there is no longer a market for the language of \u201ctough choices\u201d and \u201cthere\u2019s no money left\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/27/un-rapporteur-tax-cut-plans-of-both-johnson-and-hunt-a-tragedy\">UN rapporteur: tax cut plans of Johnson and Hunt 'a tragedy'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Will this stabilise a country in freefall from a hard Brexit or no deal at all?

      "bodyText": "You know what you\u2019re supposed to think of Boris Johnson. He is a cynical joker, a blond wrecking ball spouting Latin, an overprivileged preposteropath. He is a politician to be opposed fiercely, yet never taken seriously. Look at the tools with which journalists are covering his leadership campaign. Dollops of scepticism about his Brexit plans, a few questions about that dodgy past \u2013 and a vast yawning incuriosity about any of his other policies. You can see why that is: when one has a star so box office and a show as dramatic as Britain crashing out of Europe within a few months, then who cares about the support acts? Especially if one doubts the Bullingdon buffoon is even capable of having policies. Still, this is an astonishingly easy ride to give a man probably just three weeks away from becoming our next prime minister. It also hugely underestimates the former foreign secretary and the seriousness of the threat he now poses to our way of life. The area that has given me most pause over the past few days is the one that many of my colleagues have greeted with the greatest derision: Johnson\u2019s outlining of his economic plans. I see their absurdity, yet they do not make me laugh. Are they ridiculous? No doubt. Reckless? Of course. But could they help him secure power and forever alter Britain? Sadly, I believe they could. On early showing, Boris-onomics may be rife with intellectual contradictions, but politically it is utterly cogent \u2013 and the Tory hard right no longer seeks starred firsts, but state power. What they are putting together is a package both to buy enough of a public mandate for a no-deal Brexit, and then to rip up what remains of Britain\u2019s tattered social contract between workers, employers and the state. More worryingly, I cannot yet see anything like a sufficient response either from the Labour opposition or among the disparate groups that claim to speak for remain. What is the big difference between Johnson\u2019s economics and that practised by his former colleagues in government? In a word, cash \u2013 and lots of it. In the 2017 general election, Theresa May famously told a struggling nurse that there was no \u201cmagic money tree\u201d to give her a pay rise. Her would-be replacement has found not just one tree, but a whole forest. Pay rises for public-sector workers! Fewer workers paying national insurance! Tax cuts for the rich! And that\u2019s just for starters. As mayor of London, Johnson was mad about infrastructure, never happier than when strapped into a hard hat. He spaffed tens of millions on a garden bridge across the Thames and dreamed of erecting an airport on an estuary island. If he becomes prime minister, he will almost certainly unleash the biggest public-works programme seen this decade. You can imagine him now, performing Churchill to the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg and her camera operator on building sites across the country; or driving a crane while reciting Tacitus. High-speed rail and superfast broadband everywhere! Nuclear power stations! Airport runways! Much of this could be announced as soon as an emergency budget in September, since his team say they want the economy \u201cgoing gangbusters\u201d by 31 October, just as the government bellyflops out of the EU. Ah, you may say. Ah, but those are just more promises from the man who paraded himself in front of a lying bus. True, except every one of the serious contenders for the Tory leadership carried their own huge blank cheque. The last challenger standing, the supposed moderate Jeremy Hunt, has actually pledged greater spending commitments than Johnson. And, little noticed at Westminster, Nigel Farage this week made his first policy pledge for the Brexit party: a \u00a3200bn bung for everywhere outside London. This tells you two things. First, that the two figureheads of no-deal politics, Farage and Johnson, are now in an open bidding war to buy up the Labour leave constituencies. Johnson is pitching himself as the Tory who can see off Farage and Jeremy Corbyn: he will keep on promising to spend public millions to keep his party in government. And he may have some success: polling from January this year showed that only 36% of Labour leave voters list Brexit as a top-three issue for them or their families. Far higher rank the economy, austerity and welfare cuts. Second, that four years after Corbyn made Labour an anti-cuts party, Britain is finally entering a post-austerity era. After nearly a decade of teaching assistants resorting to food banks, of council services getting cut to the bone, and of homeless people lining our streets, the contrast will be so sharp as to be painful. When Ramsay MacDonald\u2019s government finally devalued the pound in 1931 and the much-foretold chaos didn\u2019t break out, a Labour stalwart remarked in bewilderment: \u201cNobody told us we could do that.\u201d And when Britain finally breaks with austerity, there will settle over Whitehall and town halls across the country a similar stunned amazement. But the big lesson from this is that there is no longer a market for the language of \u201ctough choices\u201d and \u201cthere\u2019s no money left\u201d. Will this stabilise a country in freefall from a hard Brexit or no deal at all? Of course not. The latest figures from the consultancy EY show that foreign direct investment into Britain is already plunging, a trend that will surely continue after Brexit. Whatever the Conservatives spend on Sunderland will dwindle into insignificance on the day Nissan finally follows Honda and Ford and announces it will halve the size of its plant there. Yet Westminster has spent years ignoring the crisis of capitalism, by bunging money at large corporations and the rich. What you can expect under Johnson is a much bigger and bolder version of this traditional Tory move \u2013 which will be hallelujahed by the rightwing press, even as it sharpens inequality between rich and poor and between regions. However malign the motives and however grotesque the result, it will be aimed at buying time for a clapped-out party and their wealth-extracting mates. Compare that with the alternatives, though. The ineffective People\u2019s Vote campaign, with its promise of \u00a34.7bn for \u201cleft-behind\u201d (a terrible term) areas. Or Corbyn\u2019s Labour, whose anti-austerity offering will struggle to stand out against a spend-happy Tory government. The opposition may claim that the Conservatives have stolen their policies, but politics isn\u2019t literature: it places little value on originality. The left can\u2019t expect that pointing out Johnson\u2019s racism or his past will sway voters \u2013 those tactics didn\u2019t stop him grabbing City Hall. Remainers can\u2019t carry on pointing out the madness of leaving the EU to turn this country into Singapore with jumpers \u2013 that didn\u2019t work in 2016. We need to get much more serious and imaginative, show that staying in the EU is the best way to end austerity, and come up with policies to improve living standards here and now. \u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>All billionaires want the same thing \u2013 a world that works for them. For many, this means a world in which they are scarcely taxed and scarcely regulated; where labour is cheap and the planet can be used as a dustbin; where they can flit between tax havens and secrecy regimes, using the Earth\u2019s surface as a speculative gaming board, extracting profits and dumping costs. The world that works for them works against us.</p> <p>So how, in nominal democracies, do they get what they want? They fund political parties and lobby groups, set up fake grassroots (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/oct/25/tea-party-koch-brothers\" title=\"\">Astroturf</a>) campaigns and finance social media ads. But above all, they buy newspapers and television stations. The widespread hope and expectation a few years ago was that, in the internet age, news controlled by billionaires would be replaced by news controlled by the people: social media would break their grip. But social media is instead dominated by stories the billionaire press generates. As their crucial role in promoting Nigel Farage, Brexit and Boris Johnson suggests, the newspapers are as powerful as ever.</p> <p>They use this power not only to promote the billionaires\u2019 favoured people and ideas, but also to shut down change before it happens. They deploy their attack dogs to take down anyone who challenges the programme. It is one thing to know this. It is another to experience it. A month ago I and six others published a report commissioned by the Labour party called <a href=\"https://landforthemany.uk/\" title=\"\">Land for the Many</a>. It proposed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/04/tackle-inequality-land-ownership-laws\" title=\"\">set of policies</a> that would be of immense benefit to the great majority of Britain\u2019s people: ensuring that everyone has a good, affordable home; improving public amenities; shifting tax from ordinary people towards the immensely rich; protecting the living world; and enhancing public control over the decisions that affect our lives. We showed how the billionaires and other oligarchs could be put back in their boxes.</p> <p>The result has been <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=%22land+for+the+many%22&amp;client=firefox-b-d&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=nws&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiloaGJlZbjAhW2R0EAHQtUDTAQ_AUIECgB&amp;biw=1408&amp;bih=688\" title=\"\">four extraordinary weeks</a> of attacks in the Mail, Express, Sun, Times and Telegraph. Our contention that oligarchic power is rooted in the ownership and control of land has been amply vindicated by the response of oligarchic power.</p> <p>Some of these reports peddle flat-out falsehoods. A week ago the <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7171049/Report-lays-Corbyns-proposal-grab-inheritances-tax-profits-family-house-sales.html\" title=\"\">Mail on Sunday claimed</a> that our report recommends a capital gains tax on people\u2019s main homes. This \u201cspiteful raid that will horrify millions\u201d ensures \u201cwe will soon be joining the likes of China, Cuba, Laos and Vietnam in becoming one of the world\u2019s few Marxist-Leninist states\u201d. This claim was picked up, and often embellished, by all the other rightwing papers. The policy proved, the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2019/06/23/labours-wealth-grab-would-iniquitous-country/\" title=\"\">Telegraph said</a>, that \u201ckeeping a hard-left Labour party out of office is not an academic ideological ambition but a deadly serious matter for millions of voters\u201d. Boris Johnson, Philip Hammond and several other senior Tories weighed in, attacking our \u201cmad\u201d proposal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/04/tackle-inequality-land-ownership-laws\">Want to tackle inequality? Then first change our land ownership laws | George Monbiot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But we made no such recommendation. We considered the idea, listed its possible advantages and drawbacks, then specifically rejected it. As they say in these papers, you couldn\u2019t make it up. But they have.</p> <p>There were dozens of other falsehoods: apparently we have proposed a \u201cgarden tax\u201d; we <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7105601/James-Brokenshire-blasts-Labours-planned-tax-raid.html\" title=\"\">intend to add</a> \u201can extra \u00a3374 a year on top of what the typical household pays in council tax\u201d (no such figure is mentioned in our report); and inspectors will be sent to people\u2019s homes to investigate their bedrooms.</p> <p>Dozens of reports claim that our proposals are \u201cplans\u201d hatched by Jeremy Corbyn: \u201cJeremy Corbyn\u2019s garden tax bombshell\u201d; \u201cJeremy Corbyn is planning a huge tax raid\u201d; \u201cCorbyn\u2019s war on homeowners\u201d. Though Corbyn is aware of our report, he has played no role in it. What it contains are not his plans but our independent policy suggestions, none of which has yet been adopted by Labour. The press response gives me an inkling of what it must be like to walk in his shoes, as I see my name (and his) attached to lurid schemes I\u2019ve never heard of, and associated with Robert Mugabe, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and the Soviet Union. Not one of the many journalists who wrote these articles has contacted any of the authors of the report. Yet they harvested lengthy quotes denouncing us from senior Conservatives.</p> <p>The common factor in all these articles is their conflation of the interests of the ultra-rich with the interests of the middle classes. While our proposals take aim at the oligarchs, and would improve the prospects of the great majority, they are presented as an attack on ordinary people. Progressive taxation, the protection of public space and good homes for all should strike terror into your heart.</p> <p>We\u2019ve lodged a complaint to the press regulator, Ipso, about one of the worst examples, and we might make others. But to pursue them all would be a full-time job (we wrote the report unpaid, in our own time). The simple truth is that we are being outgunned by the brute power of billionaires. And the same can be said for democracy.</p> <p>It is easy to see why political parties have become so cautious and why, as a result, the UK is stuck with outmoded institutions and policies, and succumbs to ever more extreme and regressive forms of taxation and control. Labour has so far held its nerve \u2013 and this makes its current leadership remarkable. It has not allowed itself to be bullied by the billionaire press.</p> <p>The old threat has not abated \u2013 it has intensified. If a newspaper is owned by a billionaire, be suspicious of every word you read in it. Check its sources, question its claims. And withhold your support from any party that allows itself to be bullied or \u2013 worse \u2013 guided by their agenda. Stand in solidarity with those who resist it.</p> <p>\u2022 George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "All billionaires want the same thing \u2013 a world that works for them. For many, this means a world in which they are scarcely taxed and scarcely regulated; where labour is cheap and the planet can be used as a dustbin; where they can flit between tax havens and secrecy regimes, using the Earth\u2019s surface as a speculative gaming board, extracting profits and dumping costs. The world that works for them works against us. So how, in nominal democracies, do they get what they want? They fund political parties and lobby groups, set up fake grassroots (Astroturf) campaigns and finance social media ads. But above all, they buy newspapers and television stations. The widespread hope and expectation a few years ago was that, in the internet age, news controlled by billionaires would be replaced by news controlled by the people: social media would break their grip. But social media is instead dominated by stories the billionaire press generates. As their crucial role in promoting Nigel Farage, Brexit and Boris Johnson suggests, the newspapers are as powerful as ever. They use this power not only to promote the billionaires\u2019 favoured people and ideas, but also to shut down change before it happens. They deploy their attack dogs to take down anyone who challenges the programme. It is one thing to know this. It is another to experience it. A month ago I and six others published a report commissioned by the Labour party called Land for the Many. It proposed a set of policies that would be of immense benefit to the great majority of Britain\u2019s people: ensuring that everyone has a good, affordable home; improving public amenities; shifting tax from ordinary people towards the immensely rich; protecting the living world; and enhancing public control over the decisions that affect our lives. We showed how the billionaires and other oligarchs could be put back in their boxes. The result has been four extraordinary weeks of attacks in the Mail, Express, Sun, Times and Telegraph. Our contention that oligarchic power is rooted in the ownership and control of land has been amply vindicated by the response of oligarchic power. Some of these reports peddle flat-out falsehoods. A week ago the Mail on Sunday claimed that our report recommends a capital gains tax on people\u2019s main homes. This \u201cspiteful raid that will horrify millions\u201d ensures \u201cwe will soon be joining the likes of China, Cuba, Laos and Vietnam in becoming one of the world\u2019s few Marxist-Leninist states\u201d. This claim was picked up, and often embellished, by all the other rightwing papers. The policy proved, the Telegraph said, that \u201ckeeping a hard-left Labour party out of office is not an academic ideological ambition but a deadly serious matter for millions of voters\u201d. Boris Johnson, Philip Hammond and several other senior Tories weighed in, attacking our \u201cmad\u201d proposal. But we made no such recommendation. We considered the idea, listed its possible advantages and drawbacks, then specifically rejected it. As they say in these papers, you couldn\u2019t make it up. But they have. There were dozens of other falsehoods: apparently we have proposed a \u201cgarden tax\u201d; we intend to add \u201can extra \u00a3374 a year on top of what the typical household pays in council tax\u201d (no such figure is mentioned in our report); and inspectors will be sent to people\u2019s homes to investigate their bedrooms. Dozens of reports claim that our proposals are \u201cplans\u201d hatched by Jeremy Corbyn: \u201cJeremy Corbyn\u2019s garden tax bombshell\u201d; \u201cJeremy Corbyn is planning a huge tax raid\u201d; \u201cCorbyn\u2019s war on homeowners\u201d. Though Corbyn is aware of our report, he has played no role in it. What it contains are not his plans but our independent policy suggestions, none of which has yet been adopted by Labour. The press response gives me an inkling of what it must be like to walk in his shoes, as I see my name (and his) attached to lurid schemes I\u2019ve never heard of, and associated with Robert Mugabe, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and the Soviet Union. Not one of the many journalists who wrote these articles has contacted any of the authors of the report. Yet they harvested lengthy quotes denouncing us from senior Conservatives. The common factor in all these articles is their conflation of the interests of the ultra-rich with the interests of the middle classes. While our proposals take aim at the oligarchs, and would improve the prospects of the great majority, they are presented as an attack on ordinary people. Progressive taxation, the protection of public space and good homes for all should strike terror into your heart. We\u2019ve lodged a complaint to the press regulator, Ipso, about one of the worst examples, and we might make others. But to pursue them all would be a full-time job (we wrote the report unpaid, in our own time). The simple truth is that we are being outgunned by the brute power of billionaires. And the same can be said for democracy. It is easy to see why political parties have become so cautious and why, as a result, the UK is stuck with outmoded institutions and policies, and succumbs to ever more extreme and regressive forms of taxation and control. Labour has so far held its nerve \u2013 and this makes its current leadership remarkable. It has not allowed itself to be bullied by the billionaire press. The old threat has not abated \u2013 it has intensified. If a newspaper is owned by a billionaire, be suspicious of every word you read in it. Check its sources, question its claims. And withhold your support from any party that allows itself to be bullied or \u2013 worse \u2013 guided by their agenda. Stand in solidarity with those who resist it. \u2022 George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist",

Last week, a European parliament advisory committee concluded that Farage should face the \u201chighest penalty\u201d for a \u201cserious breach\u201d of the code of conduct, according to a leaked letter obtained by Channel 4 News. Under European parliament rules, the decision on penalties is made by its president. The Guardian has learned that the current president, Antonio Tajani, whose term is ending, has decided to pass the dossier on to his successor rather than act on the committee\u2019s recommendations. The European parliament has long been reluctant to throw the book at members found to have breached its code of conduct. According to Transparency International, 24 MEPs were found to have broken ethics rules between 2014 and 2018, and only one reprimand was issued and none were sanctioned. Offences included six MEPs failing to declare luxury trips funded by Azerbaijan\u2019s autocratic government. Another MEP was censured for tabling 200 amendments to the EU\u2019s data protection rules that had been copied word for word from lobbyists. Farage is one of the highest paid people in the European parliament but had the worst attendance record among British MEPs. Over a four-year period between 2014 and 2018, he took part in only 40% of rollcall votes, according to researchers at VoteWatch Europe. Brexit party MEPs marked their arrival in Strasbourg for the new parliament\u2019s opening session on Tuesday by turning their backs on a youth quartet playing the European anthem Ode to Joy. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 July 2019 in line with Guardian style guidance on earnings.",

The programming of SBS World Movies (which will include many films that don\u2019t get a theatrical or home release in Australia) is the same kind of curated experience as a film festival, the viewer surrendering some autonomy and throwing themselves at the mercy of cineastes. Thus the thrill of the cinematic lucky dip: where the lows might be films that aren\u2019t your jam, but the mind-boggling highs more than make up for it. SBS describes its new channel as \u201ca celebration of the very best of world cinema\u201d. They have pledged to broadcast over 700 films a year, with at least half of them in a language other than English. That Italian zombie movie I mentioned at the start, by the way, is called Dellamorte Dellamore (Cemetery Man). A representative from SBS told me the network does not yet have plans to program it on the new channel. Something tells me, though, that Rupert Everett and the zombie bride will be back, lifting the spirits and blowing the minds of another generation of late-night movie watchers. Highlights reel Hours and hours of Studio Ghibli The jewel in SBS\u2019s crown to my mind is what\u2019s playing every weekend throughout July. From 6am to 7:30pm every Saturday and Sunday, the channel is broadcasting back-to-back screenings of animated films produced by the great Japanese production company Studio Ghibli, including Spirited Away, My Neighbour Totoro, Howl\u2019s Moving Castle, Kiki\u2019s Delivery Service and The Wind Rises. These films are famously difficult to locate online, the company maintaining tight control over rights and accessibility. Try, for example, to find the Oscar-winning Spirited Away \u2013 among the finest animated films ever made, from the great auteur Hayao Miyazaki \u2013 and you\u2019re more likely to locate conversations about how nobody can find it rather than the film itself. Jacques Tati\u2019s back catalogue The inimitable French film-maker Jacques Tati\u2019s amazing oeuvre includes my favourite feature film: the 1967 masterpiece Playtime: a hallmark in complex, spatially oriented visual comedy. Other Tati gems screening on the channel include Mon Oncle (another masterpiece) and The Illusionist (based on an unproduced screenplay by Tati, homaging his work). Regular celebrations of women in film every Thursday Highlights from this ongoing slot include the entertaining and highly unusual coming-of-age drama Pin Cushion, from British writer/director Deborah Haywood, and the eye-watering epic The Assassin \u2013 director Hsiao-Hsien Hou\u2019s lavish martial arts movie set in ancient China.",

      "bodyText": "Woolworths is set to cut and run from its poker machine business, announcing plans to combine its drinks and gambling arms into a separate venture which it will offload. The supermarket giant announced on Wednesday that Endeavour Drinks would be combined with the hotels and gaming-focused Australian Leisure &amp; Hospitality Group under the new umbrella Endeavour Group Limited. ALH owns 12,000 poker machines across 330 pubs throughout Australia, which makes it the largest pokies business in Australia. The $10bn new company, which will include 1,500 BWS and Dan Murphy\u2019s alcohol retail chains, will be demerged, either sold off or put out for an initial public offering. The separation has been flagged for 2020. \u201cThe board believes that a merger of Endeavour Drinks and ALH followed by a separation, is in shareholders\u2019 best interests and will benefit customers and team members of both groups,\u201d the Woolworths chairman, Gordon Cairns, said in a statement to the stock exchange. Woolworths was coming under pressure to divest from gambling after rival Coles announced in March it had inked a $200m deal with a private equity firm to give up control of about 3,000 poker machines. Woolworths said the decision would allow the company to have a simplified organisational structure and greater focus on the food and retail businesses. Woolworths\u2019 chief executive, Brad Banducci, told analysts the sale was not to distance the company from gambling activities, despite it facing pressure from activists to do so. \u201cIt\u2019s not about gaming, it\u2019s about helping both businesses unlock their full potential,\u201d he said. Last year, Woolworths reaped $1.6bn in sales from its hotels and gaming business. In February, gaming regulators announced they would investigate allegations ALH staff broke laws by giving poker machine players free drinks. Shares in Woolworths jumped by 1.08% to $34.02 off the back of the announcement. The Alliance for Gambling Reform spokesman Tim Costello said Woolworths had been \u201cshamed into\u201d the divestment. \u201cCongratulations to Woolworths for seeing the light finally,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThis is a globally significant development for the gambling divestment movement, not unlike Rio Tinto getting out of coal.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Costello hopes there will now be greater transparency over ALH\u2019s pokies revenue, which Woolworths refused to disclose at its annual general meeting last year. \u201cALH has long been Australia\u2019s biggest, most aggressive and most irresponsible pokies operator, pushing hard on loyalty schemes, offering up free liquor to gamblers and operating for the maximum amount of hours as the laws allow,\u201d he said. The independent federal MP Andrew Wilkie, a longtime anti-gambling campaigner, also hailed the development. \u201cPoker machine money is blood money and it was always unconscionable for one of the country\u2019s biggest supermarkets, and most well-known brands, to profit from human misery for so long,\u201d Wilkie said in a statement. Meanwhile, RSL Victoria is set to face a challenge from younger veterans to reduce poker machine numbers at a state conference in Melbourne on Thursday. Veterans from Afghanistan, Iraq and East Timor are behind a reform group who will grill RSL powerbrokers, mostly ex-Vietnam servicemen, about the merits of gambling in clubs. About 50 RSL Clubs in Victoria out of 250 have poker machines. Former army captain Dave Petersen said RSL Victoria\u2019s head office would be asked to justify why it signed a deal to pay $68m to the state government in 2022 for the rights to operate about 2,800 poker machines until 2032.",

      "bodyText": "Former rugby league players are considering a class action lawsuit against the code over the game\u2019s historic treatment of concussions. Two Sydney law firms \u2013 Bannister Law and Cahill Lawyers \u2013 have revealed they are investigating the code\u2019s liability for \u201creasonably preventable brain injuries\u201d suffered by former players. Charles Bannister, principal of Bannister Law, said the firms have been investigating \u201cthe root causes of post-retirement medical issues among numerous former NRL players\u201d for the past 12 months, with a view to a possible class action. \u201cThe structures that have evolved within the NRL through the progression of the game mean that we are looking at the clubs\u2019 and associations\u2019 liability for what are, we will allege, reasonably preventable brain injuries,\u201d Bannister said. \u201cWe will also allege that ARL, NRL and the clubs have had the resources both medical and paramedical to understand and implement protocols and policies that could and should have protected player welfare long before they were introduced.\u201d The potential lawsuit could see both major Australian football codes facing similar legal action. Greg Griffin, managing partner of Griffins Lawyers, said he had been preparing a class action against the AFL for about five years. \u201cWe are way down the track,\u201d Griffin told AAP on Wednesday. \u201cI would say it\u2019s imminent. The next stage is getting things into the court system. There is a raft of claims.\u201d The two law firms investigating the potential class action say they have been in touch with \u201cmany senior players over an extended period, all of whom have serious concerns about their brain health\u201d and were investigating \u201cthe root causes of post-retirement medical issues among numerous former NRL players\u201d. The lawsuit would look at whether the rules imposed by the code took \u201csufficient steps to protect players against concussion incidents\u201d, as well as whether those rules were \u201cactually implemented\u201d to \u201callow players time to recover from concussion incidents without sustaining permanent injury\u201d. The code\u2019s historic treatment of concussion has been subject to increased scrutiny following the discovery of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, a degenerative brain disease, in two former rugby league players. Researchers and clinicians from Royal Prince Alfred hospital, NSW Health and the University of Sydney\u2019s Brain and Mind Centre made the discovery in two donated brains from middle-aged former professionals who played more than 150 NRL games over many years. But former players have long raised concerns about the long-term impacts of concussions suffered while playing. Ian Roberts, a former Australian and New South Wales representative forward who played during the 1980s and 90s, has been outspoken about the toll of what he estimates were more than a dozen concussions suffered playing the game. Last year Roberts was one of 25 retired NRL players who took part in a study into the effects of repeated concussions on the brain, which found repeated head injuries suffered during their careers had left them with long-term impairments. But while in the US former NFL players have previously brought lawsuits against the sport\u2019s administrators over concussions suffered while playing, Roberts told Guardian Australia he had personally never investigated it as an option. \u201cI\u2019ve heard speculation about it for years but no one has ever approached me about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know why [I haven\u2019t] maybe I\u2019m being ignorant myself to not have thought about it. \u201cWould I consider legal action?

I think major sporting bodies now \u2013 and this is just solely about the NRL but any contact sport organisation \u2013 they need to make their players aware of the situation, the risks, I think everyone needs a bit of education.\u201d Linked to repeated concussions, CTE has been found in former players of American football, ice hockey, football, rugby union and others exposed to repeated head injury. The discovery of the disease in two former NRL players prompted a renewed focus of the game\u2019s handling of concussion. After the report\u2019s release, former Parramatta Eels legend Peter Sterling announced he would donate his brain to science, while other players revealed their own concerns about the toll of playing the code had taken. Speaking after the report\u2019s release last week, former Brisbane Broncos and Queensland representative forward Corey Parker said on Fox Sports that he \u201chad moments\u201d where he worried about the impact of his playing career on his health. \u201cTo be very honest I\u2019ve had moments where I\u2019ve had concerns, so much so that I\u2019ve initiated conversations [about] going and have some checks done,\u201d he said. \u201cYou put up that wall of \u2018I\u2019ll be OK, I\u2019ll be OK\u2019 until such time that you do go and have a test or have some scans done \u2026 It is the greatest game but along with that comes a price at times.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A shooting that caused panic at a mall near San Francisco left two teens with serious gunshot wounds and led to transit delays during rush hour on Tuesday, as police stopped a train to search for two suspects, authorities said. Investigators believe the shooters, both \u201cyoung males\u201d, fired at each other with handguns at the Shops at Tanforan in San Bruno, said the police chief, Ed Barberini. Zuckerberg San Francisco general hospital was treating two teenage boys hit by gunfire, according to a spokesman, Brent Andrew. One of the victims was critical and the other was in serious condition, he said. Two other people who were hurt were treated and released, but the nature of their injuries was unknown, said the San Bruno fire chief, David Cresta. Investigators believe at least one of the shooters, and maybe both, fled on a train. \u201cIt was a senseless act,\u201d said Barberini, adding that opening fire in a crowded shopping mall near a Bay Area Rapid Transit (Bart) station showed a \u201ctrue disregard for human life\u201d. Police briefly closed the 12th Street Oakland station across San Francisco Bay while officers searched a train there, Bay Area rapid transit (Bart) said. People were warned to stay away as Swat officers descended on the mall to investigate the gunfire that erupted around 4pm and sent shoppers scrambling for exits. A witness at the shopping center reported hearing eight gunshots and seeing at least two gunshot victims on the second floor, along with three people in handcuffs. One employee of a shop inside the mall, Angelica Castro, said she saw a \u201cmob of people running\u201d toward her store from the opposite side of shopping center while they were screaming \u201cshooting, shooting, shooting\u201d. \u201cTheir faces just had terror,\u201d she added. \u201cI saw people running and I heard pow, pow, pow, pow!\u201d shopper George Castro told KPIX-TV. \u201cPeople were yelling, \u2018Get out of the mall, get out of the mall, there\u2019s a shooting!\u201d\u2019 Eric Rosales said he and his family heard two or three gunshots as they arrived to see a movie at the shopping center about 10 miles south of downtown San Francisco. \u201cWe dashed inside the theater,\u201d said Rosales, of San Bruno. \u201cWe were like in a crouched position, just trying to hide out.\u201d Commuters were warned to expect train delays across the Bay Area. In a separate incident in southern California, a man has been charged with a shooting that wounded a man inside one of the nation\u2019s largest malls. Prosecutors on Tuesday said Jose Manuel Salazar, a 22-year-old from Bellflower, has been charged with attempted murder and other crimes. It\u2019s unclear whether he has an attorney. He is accused of shooting a man inside the Del Amo Fashion Center in Torrance, in the Los Angeles area. Dozens of police swarmed the scene. They searched hundreds of stores but didn\u2019t find the gunman until he was arrested Saturday in Redondo Beach. Authorities haven\u2019t released a motive for that attack.",

It was the largest percentage drop in the threshold in more than 20 years and the second largest drop in the history of the scheme.</p> <p>Two years ago, the repayment threshold was $56,000, but Australia\u2019s Coalition government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/28/student-debt-how-the-governments-hecs-changes-will-affect-you\">lowered that to $52,000 last year</a> as a budget-saving measure, and it has now been lowered again.</p> <h2><strong>How much will I have to pay?</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s a common misconception that you only start paying your Hecs debt once you graduate.

To say that university has changed my life would be an understatement | Anastasia Glushko</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If you\u2019re just over the cut-off, you will have to pay 1% of your total income. And that\u2019s pre-tax, not after.</p> <p>So if you earn $45,881 before tax \u2013 which is more like $39,000 after tax \u2013 you will pay $459 a year ($9 a week).</p> <p>As you earn more income, that percentage goes up.</p> <p>At $55,000, you will pay 2% \u2013 which is $1,100 a year ($21 a week).</p> <p>At $75,000 you will pay 4.5% \u2013 which $3,375 a year ($65 a week). The maximum is 10%, for those over $135,000. <a href=\"https://www.ato.gov.au/Rates/HELP,-TSL-and-SFSS-repayment-thresholds-and-rates/\">The full table is here</a>.</p> <p>And remember: that percentage is of your income, not your debt, and it applies to the total of your earnings. This makes it different to the bracket-based system of income tax.</p> <p>This means, in rare cases, you can get a raise that pushes you into a higher threshold but end up paying more in Hecs than you got in your raise, because the new rate applies to the totality of your income.</p> <p>For example, if you are on $52,500 a year, you pay 1%, which is $525. If you get a $500 raise to $53,000, you enter the 2% bracket and have to pay $1,060. An increase of $535 that erases your raise.</p> <h2><strong>How many people will be affected?</strong></h2> <p>An estimated 136,000 people will be affected by the lower threshold.</p> <p>To put $45,881 in context, the median wage is roughly $55,000, according to the ABS\u2019s most recent statistics.</p> <p>And the minimum full-time wage is $38,500 \u2013 only $7,000 below the threshold.</p> <p>The median full-time wage is $68,640 and the median part-time wage is $27,500.</p> <h2><strong>If I get a pay rise or start working more, will I have to start paying my Hecs immediately?</strong></h2> <p>Probably. It depends on your employer.</p> <p>Most people pay off their Hecs using the same PAYG system they use to pay taxes. This means your employer estimates your final yearly income and takes tax and Hecs payments out of your payslip at that estimated rate. If they take too much, then you get it back through a tax return.</p> <p>So if you start earning a weekly wage high enough to hit the threshold ($882 a week), it\u2019s very possible that Hecs will start coming out, and probably higher than a 1% rate.</p> <p>It\u2019s complex \u2013 but a formula has been published by the Australian Taxation Office <a href=\"https://www.ato.gov.au/Rates/Schedule-8---Statement-of-formulas-for-calculating-study-and-training-support-loans-components/\">here</a>.</p> <p>Say you work part-time for six months at the median part-time yearly salary of $27,500, which is below the threshold.

But then you take extra shifts for the next six months, and move up to the median wage of $55,000 a year, which is $1,057 a week.</p> <p>You will start paying 2% Hecs, which means $21 a week will immediately be deducted from your pay.</p> <p>But adding your wages up for the whole year, you only made $41,250 \u2013 which is below the repayment threshold. The $21 a week you were paying in Hecs will be credited back to you.</p> <p>\u201cIf too much has been withheld, any credit available will be refunded as part of the normal return process, provided no other primary tax liabilities exist including other government debt (ie Centrelink and child support),\u201d says the ATO.</p> <p>And if you work intermittently \u2013 and get larger payments, for example, over Christmas \u2013 you could pay more Hecs for those weeks.</p> <p>When you start at a new job, there\u2019s often a box you can tick to say you have a Hecs debt.

This was not a playing embarrassment like those at previous Copas and World Cups but Argentina have flopped again. His chances of ever winning an international trophy are dwindling to a maximum of two, three more attempts, and he looked a little jaded in Belo. It may now be time to step aside for the new guard. <br><br>Brazil, with better finishing, organisation, and belief in themselves, are in the final and will play the winner of Peru and Chile. They must fancy themselves, though a mounting injury list may be problematic.

There isn\u2019t, you know. OK, both teams have rather lost their sheen these days, with Argentina essentially reduced to a cast of hapless clowns in Lionel Messi\u2019s quest to win an international trophy. Brazil might have won the Olympics in 2016 but theirs has been a tale of the rest failing to live up to Neymar, and being used as some kind of Harlem Globetrotters cash cow for the national federation. <br><br>No Neymar, of course, this time around, but Messi is still huffing and puffing away, putting his hands on his hips and gesticulating as he does. And the signs of the 2-0 quarter-final defeat of Venezuela (ok, Venezuela) suggested that some other players might be coming to the fore. Giovani Lo Celso scored late on after Lautaro Mart\u00ednez scored again. <br><br>Brazil needed penalties to beat Paraguay in their quarter-final, and they have been disjointed in attack though really quite decent in defence, having not yet conceded a goal. <br><br>We know what fate awaits Argentina if they get to the final losing to Chile on penalties as they did in 2015 and 2016 - but can Brazil make it through? They last won this tournament in 2007, whereas Argentina last won it in 1993. Both seem a very long time ago. <br><br>The overall record between the teams is 45 Brazil wins, 25 draws and 39 Argentina wins. <br><br><strong>The game kicks off in Belo at 1.30 am UK time, 8.30 pm ET, 5.30 pm PT. </strong><br> </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-02T23:47:57.309Z\">at 12.47am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "And here\u2019s the match report from Tuesday night\u2019s game: The camera goes to Messi, and his bottom lip is poking out, though he is trying not to give too much away. This was not a playing embarrassment like those at previous Copas and World Cups but Argentina have flopped again. His chances of ever winning an international trophy are dwindling to a maximum of two, three more attempts, and he looked a little jaded in Belo. It may now be time to step aside for the new guard. Brazil, with better finishing, organisation, and belief in themselves, are in the final and will play the winner of Peru and Chile. They must fancy themselves, though a mounting injury list may be problematic. That was the pitched battle we wanted and expected, a classic of the genre. 90+4 min: Brazil fans celebrate and taunt their most hated opposition as the clock ticks on. It has been a great night for them. 90+3 min: Brazil take an age over a corner but then Coutinho, chasing the goal his performance deserves, goes looking for a goal. The ball is eventually cleared. 90+2 min: Argentina have not played badly, really, especially the younger guard, who have been let down - a little by the elder statesmen - and that includes Messi, who has only occasionally flashed. 90 min: Four minutes added on. Surely not for Argentina? 89 min: Argentina\u2019s tactical shift has left them shapeless. They don\u2019t even have a Mick Harford or Niall Quinn to launch the ball at. Too many ball players. Di Maria loses it and the brilliant Dani Alves runs half the length of the field then gratefully buys a foul. 88 min: Brazil being roared on as they pass the ball the around. This looks like the end for Argentina. And Messi\u2019s drought will continue. Probably forever, too. 87 min: Argentina\u2019s final change saw Paulo Dybala come on for Tagliafico. That looks too little and far too late. 85 min: Brazil having to defend like demons. But they get respite when Otamendi hits the floor. He was poleaxed by Arthur in the box. That looks like a case for VAR. But nothing given. If that was not a foul then...VAR is far less liberal at the Women\u2019s World Cup. 82 min: A Messi maraud is stopped in its tracks by a combination of Alisson and his defenders. Aguero was waiting but couldn\u2019t get on the end of the ball. Willian is the latest Brazilian to go down, though he manages to haul himself back on the field to stop the action taking place. 80 min: Jesus off, for Alan, and the City player leaves as the man of the match, having set up the second and scored the first, his first of the tournament. He has overshadowed Aguero tonight. Pep Guardiola take note. 79 min: The Brazilian wall of defending holds firm again from a corner and Di Maria wildly whacks the ball into the stand. Gabriel Jesus looks like he has a problem, perhaps muscular, perhaps as a result of the buffeting he has taken. 78 min: Argentina free-kick, and Messi will take it. It\u2019s from the same position as before but he can\u2019t even beat the wall. 74 min: That sinking feeling for Argentina, and tempers are flaring. Lionel Scaloni, the Argentina coach was booked for getting involved in a row. It came on the counter. Gabriel Jesus broke clear of Otamendi\u2019s clutches, and the ball is slipped to the Liverpool forward, whose finish is hugely calm. Armani can do nothing, and he had been left exposed by his defenders. 70 min: Brazil waste a corner when Coutinho hits the ball too obtuse an angle for his attackers to read. His final ball has not been great on a night he has played well. 68 min: It was Lo Celso who scored Argentina\u2019s second against Venezuela, having come on as sub. What can he conjure tonight? 67 min: Argentina change: Lo Celso comes on for De Paul. 66 min: Messi wins a free-kick in ominous territory by skipping past Dani Alves. Argentina want a penalty but that won\u2019t be happening. It was outside the box. We have seen these whipped in as a matter of course, but Alisson reads it well and catches the ball. It was not given the usual exocet speed but still, fine keeping. 64 min: Another Argentina chance? No, De Paul\u2019s chip is just too far for Di Maria. That sub is made: Miranda on for Marquinhos. 62 min: Marquinhos has a knock and looks like he cannot continue for Brazil, and that will be a severe blow. He has been their prime defender. Joao Miranda will come on, the veteran 34-year-old. Marquinhos looks to have done his hamstring. 61 min: Argentina knock on the door, but Brazil look dangerous as well. This game has lived up to its billing. And more. Real tension and passion. 59 min: Argentina sub: on comes Angel di Maria for Marcos Acuna. 58 min: Messi hits a post! Martinez shoots and the ball spills to Messi who rattles the ball off the woodwork. Aguero is unable to follow the ball in. Martinez, soon after that, gets booked for a tactical foul on Alex Sandro. This is reaching boiling point. 57 min: Oh wow! Wizardry from Dani Alves, and then Gabriel Jesus, but the ball came to Coutinho who saw glory and smashed the ball over. Juan Foyth is booked meanwhile for a hack at Alves during that move. 56 min: Aguero sets off on a long run but finds a blind alley. Messi looked irked by that, as he was asking for the ball. 54 min: Brazil can\u2019t be looking to hang on to this lead, can they? Extra-time may beckon if they do. Willian was brought on to add speed on the break and muscle on the right flank. 52 min: Messi is fouled as he comes away from a melee in midfield. Again, he had dropped deep. Then, he and Aguero link up to set up De Paul, bursting on, to fire in a shot. The shoot was poor. Argentina have had seven shots to Brazil\u2019s two. 50 min: Plenty of booing as Argentina play the ball around patiently until Acuna makes a mess of his pass. Then, Martinez gets the ball in space and tests Alisson with a shot that is caught. Still, that was a warning sign. 49 min: Tagliafico goes forward this time and his cross is dangerous and aimed at Sergio Aguero, but headed away by Thiago Silva. 47 min: Tagliafico, chasing back, rather carelessly concedes a corner. The kick is aimed at Thiago Silva but Armani claims it smart-casually. Willian is coming on for Brazil as a half-time sub, and it looks like Everton has come off. There are boos for that from the crowd in Belo. Ok, here we go. Is this the last 45 minutes of Lionel Messi\u2019s international career? Until, that is, he comes out of retirement for next year\u2019s Copa and the World Cup in 2022. Aaron from Ireland thinks of what might have been, though takes a dollop of fantasy. \u201cGreetings John. It\u2019s sad that Lionel\u2019s Messi\u2019s incredible career will, in part, be defined by Argentina\u2019s comical failure to deliver a single international title aside from that Olympic gold in 2008. Imagine a parallel universe where Messi declared for Spain and won multiple World Cups and European Championships side-by-side with Xavi and Iniesta.\u201d That was a breathless half, and it ends with Lionel Messi asking questions of the officials. Brazil were the better team, but only just. Gabriel Jesus\u2019 goal was the creation of the ageless Dani Alves but Sergio Aguero hit the bar with a header from a chipped Messi free-kick. 45+1 min: Whistles as Argentina mount their last attacks of the half. Brazil holding firm so far. Still yet to concede a goal in the tournament. 45 min: There will be two minutes added on. 44 min: Coutinho carries the ball 40 yards, plays in Alves, who tries another of those crosses. Again, Argentina deal well with that. Brazil are back on the attack now. 43 min: Alves swings in a great cross but Firmino cannot climb above Pezzella, who stands his ground well, stopping the Liverpool man getting his head on the ball. 42 min: Jesus wins respite by winning a free-kick, as does Coutinho straight after. Everton goes on the charge and the crowd get excited. It takes Foyth\u2019s hack behind to cool that excitement. 40 min: Some Messi wizardry, as he holds three, four defenders but Brazil are back in enough numbers to get the ball away. Acuna, meanwhile, is booked for a clash with Alves, who also got a yellow. They were contesting a throw-in. Oh, it\u2019s heated. 38 min: First shot by Messi. It goes over; he now looks up for this. He even put in tackle just now, on a rather surprised Alex Sandro. 36 min: Marquinhos has to stop an Aguero shot as Messi releases his old pal. Signs of the old telepathy coming back? Did they ever have much telepathy? Maybe at the 2008 Olympics. 35 min: Alves is OK to continue too, and that\u2019s good for this game as he has been an absolute wizard. His contribution to the goal was a rolling back of the years to his Barca peak. 34 min: Now Dani Alves is hurt and it looks painful. Ginger would be the description of his current gait. 32 min: Alisson is OK to continue, but Brazil suddenly don\u2019t look quite so solid as they did. 30 min: Close for Argentina. Only a desperate scramble clears Brazil\u2019s lines. Messi\u2019s free-kick finds the head of Aguero and he hits the crossbar! Alisson, rather conveniently, goes down with a knock and there\u2019s a break in play. 29 min: Messi asks for a yellow card for foul on him by Casemiro. Naughty boy. He gets away with it, of course. 27 min: Argentina are a little slow in their build-up before Thiago Silva, the Glasto fave, stops Martinez\u2019s progress by coming across to pull off an expert block. 25 min: Messi is now dropping deep. Already. A foul by Casemiro on Martinez gives Argentina some territory, and they take their time over their kick. Messi takes, and it\u2019s no good. Alisson claims with ease and launches Everton off down the field. Brazil\u2019s amusement arcade - their new Denilson? - gets stuck in traffic. 23 min: Dani Alves, currently clubless, has been the best player on the park. 22 min: Ok, what have Argentina got? Well, if we have seen not much of Messi we have seen even less of Aguero. 20 min: Jesus deserved his goal. His liveliness is the reason he was getting so many kicks from the opposition. Needless to say, Messi\u2019s face was a picture of derision of his teammates\u2019 defending. Alves out to Firmino on the right, and a sliding pass across the box, where Jesus is ready and waiting to score his first tournament goal in open play. 18 min: Otamendi takes out Jesus with a huge tackle, one to make Khaldoon Al-Mubarak wince. 16 min: Martinez forces a corner off Marquinhos, as Argentina start to step things up. It goes short to Messi and then to De Paul, whose cross is too low. Jesus speeds away on the counter, and is only just stopped by a desperate Juan Foyth. 14 min: A Messi slalom comes to an end when Coutinho is the last man in the pile-up to baulk the genius at work. Some afters as Paredes confronts Coutinho. \u2018Nip and tuck,\u2019 as they used to call it. 12 min: Close for Argentina! Leandro Paredes smashes it from 40 yards and only just over. 11 min: Roddy Zambrano is the referee tonight. He\u2019s from Ecuador, and has a tough night ahead. The tackle is of an Old Firm level of agricultural, and Jesus is already being patched up. 9 min: Messi appears at last to complain about Tagliafico being booked for the latest foul on Jesus. Argentina didn\u2019t have much of a case. 8 min: Argentina at last have the ball in enemy territory but soon lose it. Gabriel Jesus goes down, the second time he has got a whack already, but the referee waves that on. 6 min: No touch yet for Lionel Messi, but that\u2019s standard in an Argentina shirt and often in a Barca shirt, too, these days. 5 min: Armani takes an age over his goal-kick, looks like Argentina are trying to take the sting out of this early storm. 4 min: Corner to Brazil forced by the effervescent Everton, though that\u2019s headed clear. 2 min: Brazil are up for this and Dani Alves, the captain and 36-year-old veteran is leading the charge. And the boos tell us that Argentina are on the ball...then comes a Firmino shot, which looks to be offside, though the VAR is inconclusive. It could be one of those nights of technical confusion. Martin Perrie emails in: \u201cGood evening from a bar on the Copacabana. Is pretty quiet at the moment. A few Chileans in here and a chap in a Flamengo shirt.\u201d Can I say that Copacabana is one of the most overrated places I have ever been to? Rio in total, actually, and I did love being in Brazil. Preferred the industrialism of Sao Paulo and Belo because I am like that. And Manaus, which was superb. The teams make their way to the field at the Mineir\u00e3o stadium, the scene of this night for Brazil. And the anthems ring out, the Brazilians singing the last verse without the accompaniment of the band. That was...passionate. This one means more, yet more. Formations-wise, the word is that Brazil go 4-2-3-1 with Roberto Firmino furthest forward and Argentina go 4-3-2-1, with Lionel Messi behind Sergio Aguero and Lautaro Martinez as twin strikers.. With three of the quarter-finals finishing 0-0 at full-time - there was no extra-time in the quarters - the fear has to be a goalless draw. In the semis, there will be ET and P. By the way, check the red-hot international action that was played on Saturday in men\u2019s football. Thank goodness there were some goals in the Women\u2019s World Cup. And penalties in the Copa, with Peru winning after the karmic comedy of Luis Suarez missing his spot-kick and Chile doing what they do in shootouts in this competition. Afcon: Benin 0-0 Guinea Bissau, Cameroon 0-0 Ghana, Mauritania 0-0 Angola Copa Am\u00e9rica: Uruguay 0-0 Peru, Colombia 0-0 Chile Has Jonathan Wilson\u2019s pr\u00e9cis of Argentina\u2019s problems lost its relevance in the days since he penned this? Nope, defeats of Qatar and Venezuela have not changed much despite Scaloni, the West Ham legend, stick to his selection guns. Want to know more about this august competition? This, from 2017 by the estimable Scott Murray should do the job. Here\u2019s the lowdown on the Brazil team news. Back to Neymar, who might not be playing but will be watching in Belo, and it is rumoured he will be meeting up old oppo Lionel Messi, to tease up the speculation that \u2018Ney\u2019 is on his way back to Barcelona in a move that confounds most of us. Though the word is that Messi likes playing with Neymar and what Lionel wants, Lionel gets. Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni has made an unorthodox move. Brazil: Alisson; Dani Alves, Marquinhos, Thiago Silva; Alex Sandro; Arthur, Casemiro; Jesus, Coutinho, Everton; Firmino. Argentina: Armani; Foyth, Pezzella, Otamendi, Tagliafico; De Paul, Paredes, Ac\u00fa\u00f1a; Messi; Lautaro; Ag\u00fcero. Meanwhile, here\u2019s why some in Brazil are concerned about the future of the game: The organisers of the Copa Am\u00e9rica insisted the opening match between Brazil and Bolivia would sell out the 67,000-capacity Morumbi stadium in S\u00e3o Paulo. It didn\u2019t. Just 46,342 fans paid for tickets, leaving the ground just 70% full. With the game still goalless at half-time, the deafening silence turned to boos as Tite\u2019s men trudged off the pitch. Two goals from Philippe Coutinho and a superb solo strike from Everton Soares gave Brazil a 3-0 win, but much of the debate after the game was about the crowd\u2019s antipathy to their own team. Manager Tite said he \u201cexpected\u201d a negative reaction given the way his team played. \u201cWe need to understand. If we get forward and create chances they will applaud. Having been at big clubs, when you sometimes don\u2019t produce, then don\u2019t expect the fans to understand. They will boo. When you pass the ball along the back, from full-back to central defender to goalkeeper, the first thing you hear is boo.\u201d Dani Alves put the poor reception down to S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s clubismo tribalism and a lack of unity between fans of its three main teams. \u201cWhenever we come here to Sao Paulo, that happens,\u201d said Alves. \u201cThe people cannot separate their clubs from the Brazilian national team. In Bahia the energy is different. People miss the Brazil team, that energy the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o takes wherever it goes. Surely there will be more excitement than here.\u201d You can read the full report below: Come now, is there a grander, more historic international rivalry than that between Brazil and Argentina? There isn\u2019t, you know. OK, both teams have rather lost their sheen these days, with Argentina essentially reduced to a cast of hapless clowns in Lionel Messi\u2019s quest to win an international trophy. Brazil might have won the Olympics in 2016 but theirs has been a tale of the rest failing to live up to Neymar, and being used as some kind of Harlem Globetrotters cash cow for the national federation. No Neymar, of course, this time around, but Messi is still huffing and puffing away, putting his hands on his hips and gesticulating as he does. And the signs of the 2-0 quarter-final defeat of Venezuela (ok, Venezuela) suggested that some other players might be coming to the fore. Giovani Lo Celso scored late on after Lautaro Mart\u00ednez scored again. Brazil needed penalties to beat Paraguay in their quarter-final, and they have been disjointed in attack though really quite decent in defence, having not yet conceded a goal. We know what fate awaits Argentina if they get to the final losing to Chile on penalties as they did in 2015 and 2016 - but can Brazil make it through? They last won this tournament in 2007, whereas Argentina last won it in 1993. Both seem a very long time ago. The overall record between the teams is 45 Brazil wins, 25 draws and 39 Argentina wins. The game kicks off in Belo at 1.30 am UK time, 8.30 pm ET, 5.30 pm PT.",

better protect the whales from the impacts of tourism and ships.</p> <h2><strong>Crocodile boom</strong></h2> <p>Further north and despite a cane toad invasion, crocodile numbers are exploding, pushing the prehistoric beasts closer to humans.</p> <p>At the home of the Worora people, where six creeks flow into the Prince Regent river hundreds of kilometres north of Broome, parks and wildlife

      "bodyText": "In the turquoise waters off the Kimberley, where sheer cliffs peer down on isolated beaches, researchers are studying an underwater world \u2013 in the hope of saving it. Formed millions of years ago, the waters off Western Australia\u2019s rugged 12,000km northern-most coastline have remained a scientific mystery. But for the past five years, researchers guided by Indigenous Australians have tackled rutted dirt tracks to study an oceanic highway lying off the Kimberley\u2019s shores. It was the biggest study of its kind, involving more than 200 scientists who uncovered new humpback whale calving sites, exploding crocodile numbers, dozens of new turtle hatcheries and a possible lifeline for coral reefs. The WA Marine Science Institute (Wamsi) program coordinator, Dr Kelly Waples, says the $30m project yielded important discoveries that will help safeguard the Kimberley\u2019s marine system from climate change, tourism and increasing development. \u201cThis was a once in a lifetime opportunity to run a really large study that really helps us understand the marine environment and how it operates in a world experiencing change from human pressure and climate change,\u201d Waples says. \u201cWithout this type of scientific evidence, you know what is there but you don\u2019t know what is happening to it, and we need that information to know when to step in and try to mitigate or do things differently.\u201d The region \u2013 touted as one of the last remaining pristine wildernesses in the world \u2013 is almost entirely covered by native title rulings or applications. Compulsory legal research agreements paved the way for hundreds of Indigenous Australians from eight tribes to take part in the project, providing invaluable hunter-gatherer knowledge about a saltwater country they have maintained for centuries. Kimberley Indigenous Saltwater Science co-leader Daniel Oades says traditional input played a vital role in helping scientists locate species and read tidal movements, with some Indigenous rangers able to tell the sex of a turtle simply by the way it swims. \u201cIt was a bit of an afterthought but it was quickly realised that traditional owners had such a depth of knowledge and that they were managing country already,\u201d Oades says. Now science is catching up and filling in the gaps. Global warming catching up with the reef A key part of the study focused on efforts to save Kimberley\u2019s struggling reefs which, despite being some of the toughest in the world, are living \u201cprecariously close\u201d to their limits. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that global ocean warming is catching up with Kimberley coral reefs,\u201d Waples says. The possibility that the ocean off the Kimberley will warm by more than 1C in the next 50 years was a major focus of the study. The region\u2019s shallow corals naturally thrive despite massive 12m tidal movements that expose them to 40C temperatures for hours at a time. But between November 2015 and April 2016, 80% of the Kimberley\u2019s super-strong inshore coral was bleached after El Ni\u00f1o weather conditions sent the sea surface temperatures soaring by between 4.5C and 9.3C. University of WA marine biologist and project scientist Dr Verena Schoepf says her team found that 70% of sub-tidal coral had perished from the devastating 2016 marine heatwave that also cooked reefs around the nation. A bleached reef can re-establish if the tiny algae that gives coral its colour return when the water cools. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Schoepf says while she doesn\u2019t know if the sub-tidal coral will ever re-grow, they found its hardy inshore neighbour had made a near-full recovery. She has teamed up with Californian reef experts at Stanford University to discover the biological tricks Kimberley\u2019s intertidal corals use to survive in extreme heat. \u201cSome of our work points to these intertidal corals most likely having genetically adapted to these more extreme temperatures but we haven\u2019t been about to do the genetic analysis to prove that,\u201d she says. Genetically adapted corals have the ability to pass their hardy traits on to offspring, installing hope that \u201csuper corals\u201d could be relocated and used to help save reef systems. The idea is already being trialled on the Great Barrier Reef, where corals bred to be resilient to higher temperatures and acidity are growing in test sites. Coral reefs support not just fish but also attract tourists, with an estimated 400,000 people visiting WA\u2019s \u201cfinal frontier\u201d each year, contributing to the state\u2019s $11.8bn tourism industry. But, Schoepf warns that the Kimberley\u2019s heat-resistant corals are no match for climate change. Humpback highway Beyond the reef, in the clear waters of the Dampier peninsula, researchers say humpback whale populations are booming, 40 years after a hunting ban brought the ocean giants back from the brink. Now, from June to July each year, the whales treat the WA coast like a humpback highway. The whales travel north from feeding in the Antarctic to birth and rest in the tropical waters of the Kimberley, before turning back down the coast in September. While scientists know that the Camden Sound body of water is critical for calving and nursing whales, the new research found other parts of the coast, further south, are equally important. Waples says a growing 30,000 population is pushing the whales down the coast and they were found resting and breeding along the peninsula too \u2013 a popular tourist spot. \u201cThey found that the area of Pender Bay [on the peninsula] is an important area throughout the whole migration season,\u201d Waples says. \u201cThe whales will migrate north through Pender Bay and mothers and calves were found spending time there. \u201cCamden Sound seems to be more like an end-point [and] while it\u2019s important at parts of the season, it\u2019s not as important throughout the whole season.\u201d She says understanding this will help better protect the whales from the impacts of tourism and ships. Crocodile boom Further north and despite a cane toad invasion, crocodile numbers are exploding, pushing the prehistoric beasts closer to humans. At the home of the Worora people, where six creeks flow into the Prince Regent river hundreds of kilometres north of Broome, parks and wildlife researcher Dr Andrew Halford says non-hatchling crocodile numbers have risen by 259% in 30 years. \u201cNumbers [of saltwater crocodiles] are up in the range of a 100 to 300% increase since 1997 \u2013 when their numbers were estimated to be as low as 2,500,\u201d Halford says on the Wamsi website. \u201cIt\u2019s been 30 years, so it\u2019s a very clear example of what happens when you take human predators out of the equation.\u201d Halford says the bulging population is pushing younger male crocodiles south. In January, a 3.7 metre crocodile was killed at a popular Broome beach after a close-call with swimmers. \u201cWhat we do know is that there will be increased interactions between crocodiles and humans, and in order to provide advice on managing this, we need to learn more about the amount of available nesting habitat throughout the region,\u201d Halford says. Vulnerable dolphins While crocodiles and whales are thriving, fish diversity and dolphin populations were found to be surprisingly low. Despite being endemic to Australia, snubfin and humpback dolphins are some of the more poorly understood dolphin species. As part of this project, research teams from Murdoch and Curtin Universities used new acoustic technology to track the animals by their whistles and clicks. They found that both species, who are slow to reproduce, survive in small numbers of between 50 and 200 animals \u2013 leaving them vulnerable to human pressure. Murdoch University marine biologist Joshua Smith says the dolphins live in small, fragmented populations that stick to their own patch for breeding. \u201cThese guys are particularly vulnerable, even at the species level, given the small sample sizes and small genetic connectivity that occurs because their distribution is heavily overlapping with coastal areas, which means they are predominantly interacting with human activity on a day-to-day basis.\u201d Officials say they are unable to properly assess their conservation status because of a lack of information about the animal\u2019s population size and movements. Smith says Roebuck Bay was found to be a stronghold for one of Australia\u2019s biggest populations of snubfin dolphins, with 200 plus of the animals spotted there. Waples says that fish diversity overall was found to be surprisingly low and well below expectations considering the region\u2019s proximity to the equator \u2013 a global centre of fish diversity. Scientists will now be able to investigate further what\u2019s happening to the region\u2019s fish. The feminisation of turtles Despite an ever-growing mining industry and mammal extinctions from years of land-clearing, WA\u2019s northern frontier has become a safe haven for endangered and protected species such as turtles. Six of the world\u2019s seven turtles species call the region home and project scientists have called for a tagging program to monitor a turtle nesting hotspot at the Lacepede Islands, near Broome, among dozens of report recommendations. Turtles are especially vulnerable to climate change. Embryos can\u2019t survive when temperatures exceed 35C and incubation temperatures above 29C produce female hatchlings. Problems with turtle colonies becoming feminised is well known in other parts of the world including Australia, with one study on the Great Barrier Reef finding 99% of hatchlings were female. For the first time, researchers have uncovered what they say are all the turtle nesting beaches throughout the Kimberley. They also recorded beach temperatures so conservationists can intervene if the going gets hot. \u201cBeing able to identify all the rookery beaches was pretty exciting and important,\u201d Walpole says. \u201cUnderstanding temperatures at the nesting beaches gives us baseline information so we can think about what type of impact climate change might have and mitigate for impacts in the future.\u201d Waples says the report highlights that the region is likely to be impacted by climate change, regional development and increased human access and use. \u201cWhile Aboriginal people have lived in the Kimberley for millennia and retain strong cultural connections to their saltwater country, this coastal and marine environment increasingly supports other activities such as tourism, commercial and recreational fishing, pearling, aquaculture and major port facilities associated with resource industries. \u201cBy understanding how the environment has changed and the ecosystem has adapted over the past 100 years to what it is today, we can better predict the likely response to current and future pressures and how we might mitigate any impacts.\u201d",

They began feeding her milk and sea grass. \u201cWe call our orange kayak \u2018Mother Orange\u2019,\u201d said Nantarika Chansue, director of Chulalongkorn University\u2019s aquatic animal medicine unit in Bangkok. \u201cWhen Mother Orange sweeps by, Marium follows.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s the centre of attention. She\u2019s a baby, she\u2019s an orphan, she\u2019s rare. When she\u2019s hungry she puts her thumb in her mouth and sucks it. If she\u2019s a little bit hungry it\u2019s one hand [flipper], if she\u2019s very hungry: two hands.\u201d Marium weighs 29.5kg and is already almost the size of an adult human but dugongs can grow to be 3 metres, weigh up to 500kg, and live for up to 70 years. They are listed as \u201cvulnerable\u201d by the International Union of Conservation for Nature, signalling that they are at high risk of extinction in the wild. Nantarika hopes that Marium will learn to live independently after a period of hand-feeding, as wild manatees have done in the past. Nantarika says she does not think there is a risk Marium will become too attached to humans to return to the wild. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, because I\u2019ve seen experiences with manatees in the US \u2013 you can hand-raise them and still they go back to nature. We have to wean [the dugong off] humans later \u2013 right now we want her to attach to us [so they can care for her].\u201d Her carers are planning to build an \u201cartificial tidal pool\u201d to solve the problem of Marium beaching herself. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t learned when to go to deep water,\u201d said Nantarika, who added that Marium will be put in the pool at night so that if the tide goes down, she will still be in water. \u201cIt\u2019ll be like having a puppy and taking them into the home at night.\u201d Other challenges have involved Marium\u2019s fussiness over fake nipples when drinking vitamin-enriched milk formula. \u201cWe had all kinds of artificial nipples \u2013 goat, cow \u2013 but she didn\u2019t like them. We invented one using a rubber glove finger, stuffing it with gauze then running an IV tube through it. When she sucks it has a munchy feeling,\u201d said Nantarika. Nantarika launched an online appeal for donations to pay for Marium\u2019s care, receiving 1.7m baht (AUS $80,000). The fundraiser was halted after two days, with the amount raised thought to be enough to cover care for one year. Now Marium\u2019s fans await the launch of a video live-stream following her every move, expected from the DMCR within weeks. The department\u2019s director general Jatuporn Burutpat said: \u201cMarium is so adorable. She becomes the nation\u2019s sweetheart and helps raise public awareness to conservation and the plight of dugongs.\u201d Nantarika urged cautious optimism about Marium\u2019s future. \u201cI hope she makes it, but I\u2019m careful. She\u2019s following anything that looks like a boat. That\u2019s a great danger if she finds boats with motors.\u201d She said the enormous efforts required to raise the dugong were worth it. \u201cThis is representative of rare marine animals. She\u2019s a symbol.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of thousands of tourists scattered across the north Chilean desert on Tuesday to experience a rare and irresistible combination for astronomy buffs: a total eclipse of the sun viewed from beneath the world\u2019s clearest skies. A solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between the Earth and the sun, plunging the planet into darkness. It happens only rarely in any given spot across the globe. The best views this time were from Chile\u2019s sprawling Atacama desert north of the coastal city of La Serena, where a lack of humidity and city lights combine to create the world\u2019s clearest skies. The region had not seen an eclipse since 1592, according to the Chilean Astronomy Society. The next one is expected in 2165. La Serena, a city of some 200,000 people, saw the arrival of more than 300,000 visitors, forcing the local water company to increase output and service gas stations to store extra fuel. Police and health services were also reinforced. Office workers poured from buildings late in the afternoon to catch a glimpse of the phenomenon and a run on special \u201ceclipse-viewing\u201d glasses downtown had led to a shortage in many stores, with street vendors charging as much as $10 for a pair of the disposable, cardboard-framed lenses. Northern Chile is known for clear skies and some of the largest, most powerful telescopes on Earth are being built in the area, turning the South American country into a global astronomy hub. \u201cIn the past 50 years we\u2019ve only had two eclipses going over observatories. So when it happens and an observatory lies in the path of a totality, it really is special for us,\u201d said Elyar Sedaghati, an astronomer working as a fellow at the European Southern Observatory in Paranal, Chile. \u201cWe can finally use our toys during the day because it\u2019s always at night that we use them.\u201d The town of La Higuera was also plunged into total darkness. \u201cWe hope this milestone will transform [our town] into a tourist attraction, so that visitors ... can come to La Higuera and take a picture where there once was a total sun eclipse,\u201d Mayor Yerko Galleguillos said. Town officials distributed more than 2,000 cardboard-frame protective eyeglasses at local schools and community centres while workers built statues of huge sunglasses and a darkened sun on a local square. The total eclipse could also be seen in the Argentine town of Chascom\u00fas, where dozens braved near-freezing temperatures and strong winds and claimed a spot at a pier in a lagoon, hoping to catch a glimpse of the eclipse. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking at the sky since my youth.

Many of us teach the Holocaust at our universities, and have drawn on the Museum\u2019s online resources. We support the Museum\u2019s programs from workshops to education. </em></p> <p><em>We are deeply concerned about the Museum\u2019s recent \u201cStatement Regarding the Museum\u2019s Position on Holocaust Analogies.\u201d We write this public letter to urge its retraction.</em></p> <p><em>Scholars in the Humanities and Social Sciences rely on careful and responsible analysis, contextualization, comparison and argumentation to answer questions about the past and the present. By \u201cunequivocally rejecting efforts to create analogies between the Holocaust and other events, whether historical or contemporary,\u201d the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum is taking a radical position that is far removed from mainstream scholarship on the Holocaust and genocide. And it makes learning from the past almost impossible.</em></p> <p><em>The Museum\u2019s decision to completely reject drawing any possible analogies to the Holocaust, or to the events leading up to it, is fundamentally ahistorical. It has the potential to inflict severe damage on the Museum\u2019s ability to continue its role as a credible, leading global institution dedicated to Holocaust memory, Holocaust education, and research in the field of Holocaust and genocide studies. The very core of Holocaust education is to alert the public to dangerous developments that facilitate human rights violations and pain and suffering; pointing to similarities across time and space is essential for this task.</em></p> <p><em>Looking beyond the academic context, we are well aware of the many distortions and inaccuracies, intentional or not, that frame contemporary discussions of the Holocaust. We are not only scholars. We are global citizens who participate in public discourse, as does the Museum as an institution, and its staff. We therefore consider it essential that the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum reverse its position on careful historical analysis and comparison. We hope the Museum continues to help scholars establish the Holocaust\u2019s significance as an event from which the world must continue to learn. </em></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d1bcd238f088a7392737c19\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-02T21:37:26.991Z\">10.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/02/us/nra-donors-wayne-lapierre.html\">is reporting</a> that <strong>the National Rifle Association</strong> is experiencing some turmoil.

It is titled: <em><strong><a href=\"https://www.theplayerstribune.com/en-us/articles/sue-bird-megan-rapinoe-uswnt\">So the President F*cking Hates My Girlfriend</a>. </strong></em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1bae19df09a4d2863c25f91ed13e3158e3adc5ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bae19df09a4d2863c25f91ed13e3158e3adc5ff/0_108_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fans hold up a sign in reference to Megan Rapinoe of the U.S. before the match.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fans hold up a sign in reference to Megan Rapinoe of the U.S. before the match.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beno\u00eet Tessier/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rapinoe first gained attention, and the ire of some, for taking a knee during the national anthem in solidarity with protests from Colin Kaepernick, the NFL player who took a knee to protest disproportioate rates of police violence against African Americans. </p> <p>Rapinoe gained attention again this year when she refused to sing the national anthem and said she would probably \u201cnever put my hand over my heart again\u201d to protest a new by-law forcing players to stand. </p> <p>So when she said in an interview she would not go to the White House if invited following the World Cup, Trump went after her on Twitter. </p> <p>Bird described the \u201cout-of-body experience\u201d of having the President of the United States go after you on Twitter. Trump accused Rapinoe of being disrespectful, and predictably caused a cascade of take-downs from rightwing media. </p> <p>Let\u2019s jump into the middle with a long excerpt:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It would be ridiculous to the point of laughter, if it wasn\u2019t so gross. (And if [Trump\u2019s] legislations and policies weren\u2019t ruining the lives of so many innocent people.) And then what\u2019s legitimately scary, I guess, is like\u2026.. how it\u2019s not just <em>his</em> tweets. <strong>Because now suddenly you\u2019ve got all these MAGA peeps getting hostile in your mentions.</strong> And you\u2019ve got all these crazy blogs writing terrible things about this person you care so much about. And now they\u2019re doing <em>takedowns of Megan</em> on Fox News, and who knows whatever else. It\u2019s like an out-of-body experience, really \u2014 that\u2019s how I\u2019d describe it. That\u2019s how it was for me.<br></p> <p>But then Megan, man\u2026.. I\u2019ll tell you what. You just <em>cannot</em> shake that girl. She\u2019s going to do her thing, at her own damn speed, to her own damn rhythm, and she\u2019s going to apologize to exactly NO ONE for it. So when all the Trump business started to go down last week, I mean \u2014 the fact that Megan just seemed completely unfazed? It\u2019s strange to say, but that was probably the only normal thing about it. It\u2019s not an act with her. It\u2019s not a deflection. To me it\u2019s more just like: <strong>Megan is at the boss level in the video game of knowing herself.</strong> She\u2019s always been confident\u2026.. but that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s always been immune. She\u2019s as sensitive as anyone \u2014 maybe more!!

The American Civil Liberties Union said that the ruling \u201cwill provide much-needed relief for people being detained in cruel and inhumane conditions while going through the asylum process\u201d. The National Park Service is diverting $2.5m in fees for President Trump\u2019s Fourth of July extravaganza. The 2020 census will be printed without the citizenship question, even though President Trump said yesterday that he was \u201clooking into\u201d delaying the census over the question. The question was blocked by the Supreme Court last week. The Washington Post is reporting that the National Park Service is setting aside nearly $2.5m in entrance and recreation fees \u201cprimarily intended to improve parks across the country\u201d to cover costs associated with President Trump\u2019s Fourth of July celebration: The diversion of the park fees represents just a fraction of the extra costs the government faces as a result the event, which also includes expansive displays of military hardware, flyovers by an array of jets including Air Force One, the deployment of tanks on the Mall and an extended pyrotechnics display. By comparison, according to former Park Service deputy director Denis P. Galvin, the entire Fourth of July celebration on the Mall typically costs the agency about $2m. The White House is also distributing VIP tickets for Trump\u2019s planned speech at the Lincoln Memorial to Republican donors and political appointees, prompting objections from Democratic lawmakers who argue the president has turned the annual celebration into a campaign-like event. The Republican National Committee and Trump\u2019s reelection campaign confirmed Tuesday that they had received passes they were handing out for the event. Last month, Facebook launched a cryptocurrency called Libra. Today, Democrats on the House financial services committee sent a letter to the social media giant asking them to halt their plans: If you, like me, still have no idea what Libra is, give this piece by Kari Paul and stop being confused: If you\u2019ll rewind back to this morning, you\u2019ll recall that House Dems sued the US Treasury for President Trump\u2019s tax returns. The White House has responded: President Trump said he intends to nominate Christopher Waller, an executive vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, to a seat on the central bank\u2019s board of governors. He also said he intends to nominate Judy Shelton to the board as well. Make America France/Brazil/Turkey Again? The Associated Press is reporting that the supporters featured in campaign President Trump\u2019s reelection campaign Facebook ads are actually models - and the video footage is produced as far away as France, Brazil and Turkey: \u201cThomas from Washington,\u201d featuring the bearded young man behind a coffee shop counter, appeared aimed at evangelicals, with the voice-over quote saying the president and his family are \u201cin our prayers for strength and wisdom from God almighty.\u201d \u2033AJ from Texas\u201d seemed focused on Hispanic men. And \u201cTracey in Florida\u201d was aimed specifically at a demographic in which Trump is historically weak \u2014 young women. All are models for Turkish, Brazilian and French companies, respectively, that supply hundreds of photos and video to the popular site iStock run by Getty Images, which caters to publications, filmmakers and advertisers looking for professional, inexpensive imagery. According to the site, licenses for the video clips used in the Trump ads can be had for as little as $170. The blonde on the beach appears to be particularly prolific. Her photos and videos from the French company Tuto Photos in Roubaix, France, show her twirling in a wedding gown, walking spaniels in a meadow, getting her teeth checked at the dentist and working in a warehouse. And the star of iStock\u2019s \u201cBearded and tattooed hipster coffee shop owner posing\u201d \u2014 also known as Trump\u2019s \u201cThomas from Washington\u201d \u2014 is a fixture on the videos and photos contributed by the company GM Stock out of Izmir, Turkey. His unmistakable beard and tats can be seen on the image site strolling with a woman on the beach, sitting by a campfire and pumping iron in the gym. At least we\u2019re not talking about the tanks anymore. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has made a statement on the 2020 census going forward without the citizenship question: Almost 500 scholars signed an open letter to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, asking it to rethink its statement in which it rejected comparisons between migrant detention facilities and concentration camps. The museum issued a statement saying that it \u201cunequivocally rejects efforts to create analogies between the Holocaust and other events, whether historical or contemporary\u201d after Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez drew ire for calling the detention facilities concentration camps. As of 2:30pm, 492 scholars have signed the letter calling for the museum to retract its statement: We are scholars who strongly support the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Many of us write on the Holocaust and genocide; we have researched in the USHMM\u2019s library and archives or served as fellows or associated scholars; we have been grateful for the Museum\u2019s support and intellectual community. Many of us teach the Holocaust at our universities, and have drawn on the Museum\u2019s online resources. We support the Museum\u2019s programs from workshops to education. We are deeply concerned about the Museum\u2019s recent \u201cStatement Regarding the Museum\u2019s Position on Holocaust Analogies.\u201d We write this public letter to urge its retraction. Scholars in the Humanities and Social Sciences rely on careful and responsible analysis, contextualization, comparison and argumentation to answer questions about the past and the present. By \u201cunequivocally rejecting efforts to create analogies between the Holocaust and other events, whether historical or contemporary,\u201d the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum is taking a radical position that is far removed from mainstream scholarship on the Holocaust and genocide. And it makes learning from the past almost impossible. The Museum\u2019s decision to completely reject drawing any possible analogies to the Holocaust, or to the events leading up to it, is fundamentally ahistorical. It has the potential to inflict severe damage on the Museum\u2019s ability to continue its role as a credible, leading global institution dedicated to Holocaust memory, Holocaust education, and research in the field of Holocaust and genocide studies. The very core of Holocaust education is to alert the public to dangerous developments that facilitate human rights violations and pain and suffering; pointing to similarities across time and space is essential for this task. Looking beyond the academic context, we are well aware of the many distortions and inaccuracies, intentional or not, that frame contemporary discussions of the Holocaust. We are not only scholars. We are global citizens who participate in public discourse, as does the Museum as an institution, and its staff. We therefore consider it essential that the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum reverse its position on careful historical analysis and comparison. We hope the Museum continues to help scholars establish the Holocaust\u2019s significance as an event from which the world must continue to learn. The New York Times is reporting that the National Rifle Association is experiencing some turmoil. One of the group\u2019s major benefactors is working with other to donors to withhold monetary contributions until the group\u2019s chief executive, Wayne LaPierre, is ousted: David Dell\u2019Aquila, the restive donor, said the N.R.A.\u2019s internal warfare \u201chas become a daily soap opera and it\u2019s decaying and destroying the N.R.A. from within, and it needs to stop.\u201d He added, \u201cEven if these allegations regarding Mr. LaPierre and his leadership are false, he has become radioactive and must step down.\u201d Until that happens, Mr. Dell\u2019Aquila, a retired technology consultant who has given roughly $100,000 to the N.R.A. in cash and gifts, said he would suspend donations \u2014 including his pledge of the bulk of an estate worth several million dollars. He said he was among a network of wealthy N.R.A. donors who would cumulatively withhold more than $134m in pledges, much of it earmarked years in advance through estate planning, and would soon give the gun group\u2019s board a list of demands for reform. That dollar figure could not be verified, however, and Mr. Dell\u2019Aquila declined to provide a list of the other donors, who he said were not ready to go public. But a second prominent donor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is a senior firearms industry executive, said he was also suspending a plan to give more than $2m from his estate, as well as halting other donations, and was backing Mr. Dell\u2019Aquila\u2019s effort. \u201cThe donors are rebelling,\u201d the executive said, adding that he believed that the leadership turmoil was \u201chelping to destroy, temporarily, the strength of the N.R.A. as one of the strongest lobbying groups.\u201d Another odd twist in the sudden cancellation of Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s New Hampshire event today: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to President Trump about migrant children and their families on the border, and reiterating her desire to implement protections for them administratively. In the letter, Pelosi \u201crespectfully\u201d suggests that the president takes \u201cseveral important, immediate actions as proposed in the House legislation\u201d: The Department of Homeland Security establishes basic standards of care for individuals in the custody of US Customs and Border Protection, and that includes basic protocols for \u201cmedical assessments and emergencies; requirements for ensuring the provision of water, appropriate nutrition hygiene and sanitation needs; and standards for temporary holding facilities that adhere to the best practices for the care of children.\u201d The Department of Health and Human Services should ensure that no children remain at \u201cinflux shelters\u201d for longer than 90 days. Congress should be notified within 24 hours when a migrant child dies. Read the letter in full here. Hey all, Vivian Ho taking over for Kari Paul and Jessica Glenza. Happy Tuesday. Kari Paul, logging off after a brief blog stint! Passing along to Vivan Ho. The Trump administration confirmed Tuesday the 2020 Census questionnaire will be printed without questions regarding citizenship status. The administration was looking at delaying the census after the Supreme Court blocked a question regarding citizenship on the annual head count of people int he United States. Hello readers, Kari Paul in San Francisco taking over the live blog for the next hour or so. Stand by for more news. In a statement announcing hearings into the treatment of migrants held in detention facilities at the southern border, Representative Elijah Cummings has said the Trump administration has displayed \u201copen contempt\u201d of \u201cbasic human decency\u201d. More from Reuters: The House Oversight Committee has scheduled a hearing next week on the separation and treatment of immigrant children and has launched an investigation into reports of offensive Facebook posts by border patrol officers, the panel said on Tuesday. Cummings, the committee\u2019s Democratic chairman, said the panel had invited Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan from the Department of Homeland Security and Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan from U.S. Customs and Border Protection to testify on July 12. \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s actions at the southern border are grotesque and dehumanizing,\u201d Cummings said. \u201cThere seems to be open contempt for the rule of law and for basic human decency.\u201d Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other House Democrats were shocked by the conditions in a Customs and Border Protection facility Monday evening, and the issue continued to dominate the agenda on Tuesday. While Republicans have attempted to deter migrants from coming to the southern border, Democrats highlighted shocking conditions inside detention facilities. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York called conditions \u201chorrifying\u201d, and later said CBP was a \u201crogue\u201d agency. A day earlier, ProPublica revealed a secret Facebook group of thousands of immigrations agents which featured lewd jokes and insults about migrants and Ocasio-Cortez herself. CBP took Congress members\u2019 phones at the gates of the detention facility. The chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Representative Joaquin Castro of Texas, smuggled a recording device into a detention facility so he could later tweet a video of the conditions. By the end of the day, the Democrat-led House called a hearing on the treatment of migrant children for next week. Also today... President Trump tweeted that the Fourth of July celebration would have huge fireworks and flyovers. Those same celebrations would prompt temporary closure of Reagan airport in Washington DC. That had not been necessary in previous years. Trump\u2019s campaign also encouraged supporters to come to the July 4 celebrations at the National Mall, a move critics said showed the president was likely to politicize the Independence Day celebrations. White House advisor Kellyanne Conway had a combative exchange with reporters, who she accused of tossing her a question akin to a \u201cMolotov cocktail\u201d. A government oversight agency recently recommended the Trump administration fire her for repeatedly violating the Hatch Act, which bars appointees from mixing campaigning with government business. Vice President Mike Pence canceled an opioid roundtable to return to Washington DC. His staff said the cancelation was not related to health or national security, but has failed to quell speculation about why he was called back from the scheduled trip. This was an animating issue in last week\u2019s Democratic Presidential debates \u2013 the private prison companies which run immigration detention facilities. There are currently 52,000 migrants held in Immigrations and Customs Enforcement custody, and 71% of them are held in private prison facilities whose subcontractors are nearly impossible to track down, according to reporting from NPR. If there\u2019s one throughline between every single component part of the ICE detention system, it is opacity; it\u2019s like intentional lack of transparency,\u201d said Heidi Altman, director of policy at the National Immigrant Justice Center. Quick reminder that today is the anniversary of passage and signing of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, barring discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. We have a new report from the Associated Press. Advocates for child migrants are suing the Trump administration to block a memorandum they say significantly curtails asylum rights. Here\u2019s more: Attorneys from Catholic Legal Immigration Network and Kids in Need of Defense are asking a federal judge in Maryland for a temporary restraining order benefiting all asylum seekers affected by the policy change. Their lawsuit claims the memo violates a 2008 law that protects children entering the U.S. without a parent or guardian. USCIS spokesman Daniel Hetlage said in an email Tuesday that the agency doesn\u2019t comment on pending litigation. If you want to follow the Women\u2019s World Cup semi-final, do it here where we\u2019re watching live. As we get ready for the start of the USA v England Women\u2019s World Cup semi-finals, now seems like the best time to highlight an article by star player Megan Rapinoe\u2019s girlfriend, WNBA star Sue Bird, in Player\u2019s Tribune. It is titled: So the President F*cking Hates My Girlfriend. Rapinoe first gained attention, and the ire of some, for taking a knee during the national anthem in solidarity with protests from Colin Kaepernick, the NFL player who took a knee to protest disproportioate rates of police violence against African Americans. Rapinoe gained attention again this year when she refused to sing the national anthem and said she would probably \u201cnever put my hand over my heart again\u201d to protest a new by-law forcing players to stand. So when she said in an interview she would not go to the White House if invited following the World Cup, Trump went after her on Twitter. Bird described the \u201cout-of-body experience\u201d of having the President of the United States go after you on Twitter. Trump accused Rapinoe of being disrespectful, and predictably caused a cascade of take-downs from rightwing media. Let\u2019s jump into the middle with a long excerpt: It would be ridiculous to the point of laughter, if it wasn\u2019t so gross. (And if [Trump\u2019s] legislations and policies weren\u2019t ruining the lives of so many innocent people.) And then what\u2019s legitimately scary, I guess, is like\u2026.. how it\u2019s not just his tweets. Because now suddenly you\u2019ve got all these MAGA peeps getting hostile in your mentions. And you\u2019ve got all these crazy blogs writing terrible things about this person you care so much about. And now they\u2019re doing takedowns of Megan on Fox News, and who knows whatever else. It\u2019s like an out-of-body experience, really \u2014 that\u2019s how I\u2019d describe it. That\u2019s how it was for me. But then Megan, man\u2026.. I\u2019ll tell you what. You just cannot shake that girl. She\u2019s going to do her thing, at her own damn speed, to her own damn rhythm, and she\u2019s going to apologize to exactly NO ONE for it. So when all the Trump business started to go down last week, I mean \u2014 the fact that Megan just seemed completely unfazed? It\u2019s strange to say, but that was probably the only normal thing about it. It\u2019s not an act with her. It\u2019s not a deflection. To me it\u2019s more just like: Megan is at the boss level in the video game of knowing herself. She\u2019s always been confident\u2026.. but that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s always been immune. She\u2019s as sensitive as anyone \u2014 maybe more!! She\u2019s just figured out how to harness that sensitivity. Back to the conditions at the border that US Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez described as \u201chorrifying\u201d. Buzzfeed has interviewed two nurses in a south Texas hospital, who said children brought to them from Customs and Border Protection were at times so ill healthcare workers considered calling specialized rapid response teams to prevent cardiac arrest. In another instance, a nurse said teenagers were so dehydrated \u201ctheir lips are cracked\u201d. White House officials are still not giving a reason why Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s canceled a trip to an opioid roundtable in New Hampshire. His chief of staff Marc Short is emphasizing the return was not for a health or national security concern. Here\u2019s Short, via David Smith, our reporter in Washington DC: The vice president had a trip to New Hampshire today for an opiate event that we look forward to rescheduling probably a month out,\u201d Short said at the White House. \u201cHe was returned back to the White House but it was not for a national security issue and it\u2019s not for any sort of health concern. He\u2019s met the president; he\u2019ll meet with him again probably this afternoon.\u201d Last week\u2019s Democratic debates and new fundraising totals are likely to trigger another event in Washington \u2013 thinning of the Democratic presidential field. Politico is reporting senior staff of former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper urged him to drop out of the race and consider running for Senate. Hickenlooper\u2019s fundraising totals will make it difficult for him to qualify for debates this fall. Democrats must win the US Senate in 2020, or they are unlikely to accomplish significant policy goals even if they win the White House. A dozen Democrats in Colorado have already announced bids to oust Republican US Senator Cory Gardner. Here is more from the Politico report: The source said that the campaign only has about 13,000 donors, making it almost impossible to qualify for the next round of presidential debates in the fall. The campaign also only raised just over $1 million in the second quarter \u2014 about what he raised in the first 48 hours of his candidacy \u2014 and will likely run out of money completely in about a month. At least five staffers have left or are leaving Hickenlooper\u2019s struggling operation, including his campaign manager, communications director, digital director and finance director. Hickenlooper named a new campaign manager on Monday night. The Hickenlooper campaign declined to comment for the Politico story, the outlet reported. Let\u2019s return quickly to something earlier in the blog \u2013 Vermont Senator and Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sander\u2019s fundraising totals for the second quarter for 2019. He said he said he raised $18m from mostly small donations. The Associated Press has just reported Presidential Trump\u2019s fundraising totals for the second quarter: a mind-boggling $105m. The campaign already had a \u201cwhopping $100m on hand\u201d. More from AP here: Campaign manager Brad Parscale says the total is \u201ca testament to the overwhelming support\u201d for Trump, who formally announced for reelection in June. Parscale says none of the Democrats who are competing for the right to challenge Trump in 2020 can match the president\u2019s fundraising prowess or the level of enthusiasm for him. The money was raised by the Trump campaign, Trump\u2019s joint fundraising entities and the Republican National Committee. Campaigns have until July 15 to report their fundraising totals to the Federal Election Commission, but many will release their end-of-quarter totals if the numbers are especially good. While Trump did not raise as much money as his rival in 2016, he did go on to have the most expensive inauguration of all time, much of it financed by corporations and wealthy individuals. In a combative interaction with the press about the Fourth of July holiday, White House advisor Kellyanne Conway accused a reporter of tossing a question, \u201clike a Molotov cocktail\u201d. You took all of that just to have a negative, toss it at me like a Molotov cocktail, and hope you get to be on the nightly news tonight.\u201d Later in the gaggle, a reporter states they are asking her questions because, \u201cWe don\u2019t have a press briefing so this is out chance to ask you for substance.\u201d Here is the full video from C-SPAN, and a short clip of Conway accusing reporters of \u201cpoliticizing\u201d the event below. Texas US Representative Lloyd Doggett, a member of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, just released this statement on a Democratic lawsuit attempting to force the US Treasury to release Trump\u2019s tax returns: This long-overdue legal action is needed to keep this bad president from setting a bad precedent. It should not take a court order to affirm that \u2018shall\u2019 means \u2018shall.\u2019 But Trump will do what it takes to delay the inevitable, hiding his tax returns as long as he can. Republican silence and Democratic timidity will not produce the documents we need to ensure accountability. Trump must learn that no President can ignore laws he doesn\u2019t like.\u201d Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a staunch conservative, has just asked the head of the Department of Homeland Security to establish a process to accept donations for children in Customs and Border Protection\u2019s custody. Members of Congress said they found \u201chorrifying\u201d conditions in a CBP detention center on Monday. I thus urge you to establish and publicize a process for accepting donations from charitable organizations, faith-based organizations, and NGOs to aid individuals in CBP custody,\u201d Sen. Cruz wrote. \u201cEven with the additional supplemental emergency funding [that Congress recently passed], I am confident that DHS and CBP can still use the generosity of the American people to help manage the humanitarian crisis on our border. Congress, Texans, and the American people thank you and your Department for your hard work in addressing this crisis.\u201d While most Americans are preparing to barbecue and relax on the Fourth of July, President Trump has promised \u201cIncredible Flyovers &amp; biggest ever Fireworks!\u201d (sic). Trump\u2019s campaign emailed supporters this morning, inviting them to the celebration on the National Mall in Washington DC. Here\u2019s more from the Associated Press: Trump said Monday that tanks will be part of a special event he\u2019s headlining Thursday to honor the military. An Associated Press photographer found at least two tanks and other military vehicles on flatcars in a railyard in southeast Washington. Trump tweeted Tuesday: \u201cBig 4th of July in D.C. \u2018Salute to America.\u2019 The Pentagon &amp; our great Military Leaders are thrilled to be doing this &amp; showing to the American people, among other things, the strongest and most advanced Military anywhere in the World. Incredible Flyovers &amp; biggest ever Fireworks!\u201d More on Vice President Pence\u2019s schedule change from his press secretary: A little more perspective on some of the polls out today. There are a lot of polls out today about which Democratic presidential candidates are doing well following last week\u2019s debates. There are fewer polls about issues they discussed. That is what makes this Morning Consult/Politico poll about Medicare-for-all so interesting. It finds a majority of voters would favor a government-run healthcare system (like the UK\u2019s health system) if they were able to continue going to the same doctors and hospitals. Only four of 20 candidates who qualified for the debate supported eliminating private insurance in favor of a government-run system. One of them was Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. These numbers only affirm what the senator has said many times: people don\u2019t like insurance companies, they like their doctors and their hospitals,\u201d Sanders\u2019 campaign said of the data in an email to Morning Consult. \u201cDespite what the pharmaceutical and insurance industries will tell you, Medicare for All is the only proposal that gives Americans the freedom to control their own futures \u2014 change jobs, start a family, start a business \u2014 and keep their doctor.\u201d The poll comes after another recent report on a huge increase in lobbying against Medicare-for-all. The number of registered lobbyists working against such a proposal rose from 29 in the first quarter of 2018 to 270 in the first quarter of 2019 \u2013 a nearly 10 fold increase, according to Public Citizen. The Boston Globe is now Vice President Pence\u2019s flight was diverted, but the situation was not an emergency. The situation is developing and we still lack details about what canceled Pence\u2019s event. We have just gotten word an expected opioid roundtable in New Hampshire featuring Vice President Mike Pence was canceled so he could attend to an \u201cemergency\u201d. Trump has broken decades of presidential precedent by refusing to release his tax returns. Washington DC\u2019s Reagan Airport will suspend operations for more than two hours over the July 4 holiday for flyovers. Bernie Sanders has raised $18m for his campaign in the second quarter of 2019. Most of those donations were for less than $100. The number on profession of donors were teachers. With the July 4 holiday quickly approaching, Trump is being increasingly criticized for his handling of the celebration on the National Mall. The president ordered military tanks to Washington DC for the event, his campaign emailed supporters, and gave away \u201cVIP\u201d tickets to political appointees and Republican operatives. Following the Democratic debates last week, we are starting to see some of the first polls to reflect those performances. This one is taken among progressives. A new poll conducted of supporters of Indivisible, a group that supports progressive candidates, has found supporters had favorable opinions of US Senators Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris after the first Democratic debates. Just a note here about this poll \u2013 it is not as random sample. It was conducted among members of the Indivisible email list. This is from Indivisible\u2019s national political director Mar\u00eda Urbina: We asked Indivisibles to identify which candidates they are considering voting for and which they are definitely not. The results revealed that the historic candidacies of women, people of color and LGBTQ candidates are faring well among the movement and have plenty of room to grow as the field narrows. It also revealed that some of the presumed frontrunners may hit a ceiling with activists, given how many Indivisibles say they aren\u2019t considering them at all. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has just described Customs and Border Protection as a \u201crogue agency\u201d following the Congressional tour of a detention facility yesterday. On a tour of a detention facility in El Paso, Texas on Monday evening, members of Congress said they found shocking conditions. Detainees told members of Congress they were forced to drink out of toilets because there was no water, that a woman had her medication changed at the detention facility, and that another woman needed medical attention for a lump on her neck. Good morning and welcome to our politics liveblog. Today, all eyes are on the conditions at migrant detention facilities. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called conditions there \u201chorrifying\u201d. After touring two camps in Texas, Ocasio-Cortez said: \u201cWhat we saw today was unconscionable.\u201d She went on: \u201cThe idea that we have to choose between people is a false notion. No child ever has to suffer for the benefit of another, and I will never accept that argument.\u201d As well, a secret Facebook group revealed by ProPublica shows that border agents insulting migrants and making sexualized threats against Ocasio-Cortez. We\u2019re also expecting to hear more about a roundtable on opioids held by Vice President Mike Pence and Democrats on the campaign trail.",
