      "bodyText": "\u201cIf you\u2019re fond of sand dunes and salty air, quaint little villages here and there \u2026\u201d These song lyrics, sung by Patti Page in 1957, and sampled by Groove Armada 40 years later, perfectly capture the mood of this idyllic seaside region of Shoalhaven. Tucked into the coastline, off the main highways, is a string of beachside villages and tiny towns from Berry all the way to North Durras. Days feel laid-back down on this coast, but there\u2019s so much to do, see and eat. We asked Cunjurong Point local and photographer Marcus Clinton for his recommendations on the best this idyllic coastal stretch has to offer. DAY 1 Hampden Bridge, Kangaroo Valley 8am Leave Sydney early and drive south via the inland route (M31) through Kangaroo Valley next to Morton National Park. 10am Pick up coffee and a snack to go from Hampden Deli, Dining &amp; School. The menu changes daily and everything is made in-house using seasonal produce. If you\u2019re ready to stretch your legs, head over to Fitzroy Falls for bushwalking and birdwatching. 1pm Drive the country roads to Berry for lunch at the Berry Sourdough Bakery. This should be a stop on any road trip south. Specialising in sourdough bread and European pastries, the bakery also sells local produce, good coffee and kombucha on tap. The croque monsieur is a decadent option, filed with layers of smoked ham and oozing with hollandaise sauce. Leave with a loaf of sourdough bread. Pick up some cinnamon doughnuts from the Famous Berry Donut Van for afternoon tea. You won\u2019t regret it. 3pm In the afternoon, walk to the Cape St George Lighthouse ruins at Jervis Bay. The lookout has sea and cliff views and is a great place to watch the whale migration from May to November. 4.30pm Check in to your accommodation at Bannisters by the Sea, a boutique clifftop hotel overlooking Mollymook Beach. This once-tired coastal motel has been turned into a chic beachside 34-room hotel with white walls, palm trees and private balconies. 5pm Read a book on the deck or have a drink at the bar and settle in. 7pm Dinner at South Coast favourite, St Isidore. Clinton highly recommends dining here. \u201cIt\u2019s our favourite restaurant in the area,\u201d he says. Chef Alex Delly previously worked under notable chefs such as Teage Ezard, Andrew McConnnell and Rick Stein. St Isidore sits on rolling dairy pastures, and uses fresh produce from its own kitchen garden. \u201cPretty much everything else on the menu is made in-house or found locally,\u201d Clinton says. This includes the pork neck, the baby turnips and the sea urchin butter that you spread on your bread. Day 2 Huskisson Markets 7am Get up early for a surf at Mollymook, depending on the swell. \u201cThis coast is full of great surf spots,\u201d Clinton says. \u201cCheck the weather report and take your pick.\u201d For a surf lesson, check out Pam Burridge\u2019s Surf School, run by the Australian former world champion. 9am After a splash, refuel with breakfast and coffee at Brown Sugar in Milton. 10am Visit the Milton Produce Market (Saturdays mornings) to get a taste of local veggies, fruit, bread, preserves, cakes and more. While you\u2019re in Milton, have a look at its gorgeous boutiques and homewares shops. You\u2019ll find something for the senses at Essence of Milton, luxe homewares and linens at Spaces2538, and antiques and 20th-century furniture at Revival (often a goldmine for recycled and rare secondhand furniture). 12pm Head back to your hotel for lunch at Rick Stein at Bannisters.

Harvest also has a mobile bar in a caravan called Harvey that travels to festivals and events on the South Coast. 7.30pm Dinner is at Tallwood Eatery down the road in Mollymook. Food here is made with mostly local produce. \u201cCurrently, on Mondays they do chef\u2019s choice, $45 per head for three courses,\u201d Clinton says. \u201cTurn up and they cook for you, no menu, it\u2019s great.\u201d Day 3 Adnate artwork on Shoalhaven library 9am Sleep in before breakfast at Pilgrims Vegetarian Cafe in Milton.

      "body": "<p>Victims of sexual violence are receiving \u201ca terrible deal\u201d from the criminal justice system with only 2% of their attackers convicted in court, according to the outgoing victims\u2019 commissioner.</p> <p>In her final report after six years in office, Helen Newlove said there had been a breakdown in trust and that victims were being failed by law enforcement agencies. She called for victims of sexual violence to be provided with independent legal advice.</p> <p>Reporting a rape or sexual assault was, for many victims, \u201cas harrowing as the crime itself\u201d, Lady Newlove said. Figures from the National Crime Survey for England and Wales show more than four in five of those who are sexually assaulted do not report it to the police. Only 2% of cases end up in a conviction.</p> <p>The growth of digital technology and the ubiquity of smartphones had created vast quantities of personal data, Newlove said, exposing private lives to greater scrutiny even though there was anonymity for victims.</p> <p>\u201cWe have created a climate whereby victims of sexual violence are routinely having their personal lives disproportionately investigated and disclosed in criminal trials,\u201d her report noted. \u201cIn doing so, we are retraumatising them and potentially infringing a most basic human right \u2013 the right to privacy.\u201d</p> <p>Victims are routinely asked to sign what is called a \u201cStafford statement\u201d, giving police and prosecutors the right to access and disclose to the court and defence team any of their historical personal data that might be relevant to the case.</p> <p>Most do not have a lawyer they can consult. \u201cNor can they expect to be consulted throughout the process.

In her final report after six years in office, Helen Newlove said there had been a breakdown in trust and that victims were being failed by law enforcement agencies. She called for victims of sexual violence to be provided with independent legal advice. Reporting a rape or sexual assault was, for many victims, \u201cas harrowing as the crime itself\u201d, Lady Newlove said. Figures from the National Crime Survey for England and Wales show more than four in five of those who are sexually assaulted do not report it to the police. Only 2% of cases end up in a conviction. The growth of digital technology and the ubiquity of smartphones had created vast quantities of personal data, Newlove said, exposing private lives to greater scrutiny even though there was anonymity for victims. \u201cWe have created a climate whereby victims of sexual violence are routinely having their personal lives disproportionately investigated and disclosed in criminal trials,\u201d her report noted. \u201cIn doing so, we are retraumatising them and potentially infringing a most basic human right \u2013 the right to privacy.\u201d Victims are routinely asked to sign what is called a \u201cStafford statement\u201d, giving police and prosecutors the right to access and disclose to the court and defence team any of their historical personal data that might be relevant to the case. Most do not have a lawyer they can consult. \u201cNor can they expect to be consulted throughout the process. This blanket consent allows police and CPS access to all your personal data from school, social services, medical, psychiatric or even notes from counselling. \u201cDisclosure of such sensitive material can have a devastating emotional effect on the victims.

      "bodyText": "Giant flightless birds that dwarfed modern ostriches and weighed nearly half a tonne roamed Europe when the first archaic humans arrived from Africa, scientists say. Researchers unearthed the fossilised thigh bone of one of the feathered beasts while excavating a cave on the Crimean peninsula on the northern coast of the Black Sea. It is the first time such a massive bird has been found in the northern hemisphere. Analysis of the 40cm-long bone and others found with it date the remains to between 1.5m and 1.8m years old, suggesting the birds may have been part of the local wildlife when Homo erectus, an ancient ancestor of modern humans, reached Europe 1.2m years ago. The enormous birds may well have been a valuable source of meat, bones, feathers and eggshells for the early human settlers, the scientists say. Nikita Zelenkov, a palaeontologist at the Russian Academy of Sciences, said that when he first received the thigh bone for study he thought it must be from a long-extinct elephant bird from Madagascar. \u201cNo birds of this size have ever been reported from Europe,\u201d he said. But close inspection revealed that the bird probably belonged to an ancient species called Pachystruthio dmanisensis, a stocky, flightless creature that stood about 3.5 metres tall. Based on measurements of the thigh bone, the scientists calculate the bird weighed about 450kg, which is twice the weight of the largest extinct moas from New Zealand, three times heavier than the largest living bird, the common ostrich, and nearly as heavy as an adult polar bear. The fossils are described in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. \u201cWe don\u2019t know when it became extinct exactly, but most likely it did not survive later than 1.2m years ago,\u201d Zelenkov said. \u201cThey would have been seen by various Homo erectus people.\u201d Despite the bird\u2019s bulk, the long, slim thigh bone shows it was fast on its feet. Other remains recovered from the cave offer some explanation as to why that may have helped: the giant bird lived alongside some of the most formidable predators of the Ice Age, from sabre-toothed cats to other over-sized carnivores, including giant cheetahs and giant hyenas. All could take on prey as large as mammoths. Evolution has decorated the tree of life with a bizarre collection of bulky birds. The apparently herbivorous Gastornithidae, a family of prehistoric flightless birds with powerful legs and enormous beaks, stalked Europe, Asia and North America, from 66m to 35m years ago. When fully grown, some species reached three metres tall. A similar-sized feathery beast brought terror to the rainforests of Australia\u2019s Northern Territory 15m years ago. Technically known as Bullockornis planei but named the \u201cdemon duck of doom\u201d by a researcher with an eye for publicity, the bird sported a scythe-like beak on a head the size of a horse\u2019s. Also known as thunderbirds, the beasts are thought to have survived until at least 50,000 years ago. Scientists have argued over the identity of the world\u2019s largest bird for decades, but last year researchers at the Zoological Society of London attempted to settle the matter. They set out with a tape measure and a pair of callipers to measure hundreds of bird bones in museums around the world and came across one creature from Madagascar that stood three metres tall and weighed up to 800kg.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has vowed he will push for introducing an immigration system modelled on a so-called Australian-style points system, resurrecting one of the key promises of the Vote Leave campaign. In a pledge that could pave the way to abandoning the Conservatives\u2019 net migration target, Johnson said the country needed to be more open to highly skilled immigrants and tougher on those who \u201cabused\u201d the UK\u2019s \u201chospitality\u201d. Johnson\u2019s camp stressed this proposal was not intended to suggest he would abandon the current proposed immigration bill, but would instead give new instructions to the migration advisory committee (MAC) to investigate the idea of a points-based system. The MAC will be asked to consider how people can be admitted to the UK on the basis of specific criteria, including by examining the Australian points system. \u201cWe will restore democratic control of immigration policy after we leave the EU,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe must be much more open to high-skilled immigration, such as scientists, but we must also assure the public that as we leave the EU we have control over the number of unskilled immigrants coming into the country. \u201cWe must be tougher on those who abuse our hospitality. Other countries such as Australia have great systems and we should learn from them.\u201d The UK already has a points-based system for non-EEA migrants, introduced by the Labour government in 2008, where eligibility is determined by a set of mandatory criteria to which a fixed number of symbolic points are attached. A Commons library paper on the system, published in 2018, said: \u201cCalls for the UK to adopt a system closer to the \u2018Australian model\u2019 have persisted, although it has not always been obvious what advocates specifically have in mind.\u201d Johnson also pledged he would ensure EU nationals\u2019 rights were entrenched and said he regretted that that had not happened straight after the 2016 referendum. \u201cI will sort it out immediately and make sure that this issue is properly dealt with, and millions of people can stop worrying,\u201d he said. The government has already introduced a new immigration bill, which ends freedom of movement for EU nationals, though it does not specify the shape of the immigration system from 2021. A government consultation has started on the system but the home secretary, Sajid Javid, has already ordered a review of Theresa May\u2019s proposed \u00a330,000 salary threshold for immigrants to qualify for work visas, asking the MAC to look again at the plans. Johnson said he would continue with the current immigration bill but also ask MAC to look at what elements of the Australian points-based system could be incorporated into the immigration systemto be introduced from 2021. The Conservative leadership frontrunner was among several leading members of Vote Leave who floated the idea, during the referendum campaign, of an Australian-style system to replace free movement. Neither Johnson\u2019s campaign nor Vote Leave promised that the system would reduce immigration. Johnson\u2019s leadership rival, Jeremy Hunt, also announced a new policy, pledging to waive tuition fee debt for young people starting new businesses that employ more than 10 people for five years. Hunt, who has staked his leadership campaign on his background as an entrepreneur, said: \u201cIf we are to turbo-charge our economy and take advantage of Brexit we need to back the young entrepreneurs who take risks and create jobs. \u201cI want more young people to have the confidence to take the decision to start their own business so we create wealth and start thriving as a country again.\u201d His campaign said student entrepreneurs employing others would create far more benefit for the economy than the cost of tuition fees. Statistics from the Higher Education Statistics Agency suggest just 1% of students start their own businesses, although 5% are freelance or self employed.",

      "bodyText": "Internazionale are preparing their first bid for Romelu Lukaku as they attempt to sign the forward from Manchester United this summer. The Italian club met with the Belgian\u2019s representative, Federico Pastorello, on Wednesday and were told that Lukaku wants a move to Inter to work with their new coach, Antonio Conte. Inter\u2019s offer to Manchester United will involve an initial two-year deal worth \u20ac10m (\u00a39m) with an obligation to buy at the end of the loan period for \u20ac60m (\u00a353.8m), taking the total fee for the transfer to \u00a362.8m. The structure of the deal would allow Inter to conduct other transfer business this summer while still securing their No1 target, Lukaku. Inter are in the process of setting up meetings with United to discuss a possible deal and are set to discuss the matter with representatives from the Premier League club early next week. The Italian side are still eager to sell their Argentinian forward, Mauro Icardi, and are hopeful of getting around \u00a360m for him but if they seal an initial loan deal for Lukaku, the need to sell Icardi becomes less pressing. Lukaku wants to leave Old Trafford after two years at the club. He lost his place at times last season under Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r while Conte is a huge admirer of him and tried to sign him when in charge of Chelsea in 2017. The Belgian scored 27 goals in his first season at the club but managed only 15 in 2018-19. On Wednesday United agreed a deal to sign the Crystal Palace full-back Aaron Wan-Bissaka for an initial fee of \u00a345m, rising to \u00a350m. The club have already signed the Swansea winger Daniel James in this transfer window.",

      "bodyText": "OK everybody, it\u2019s been real. But now it\u2019s time for the first of the 2020 DNC presidential primary debates! My colleague Adam Gabbatt is in Miami and will have all the updates you could possibly need. Follow along on the live blog here: Seriously, is every 2020 Democratic presidential candidate visiting the Homestead facility? With just minutes to go to the first of the Democratic primary debates, President Trump has begun tweeting up a storm. Immediately after his tweets about impeachment and Robert Mueller, the president moved right on to immigration. It\u2019s almost as if he doesn\u2019t want you to pay attention to something. Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper responds to his earlier rough start to tonight\u2019s debate: The happening place to be? The political celebrity sightings have begun. Andrew Gillum, the progressive from Tallahassee who almost won the red state Florida governor\u2019s mansion for the Democrats, is spotted down the street. Before the debate tonight, take a look at what some of the Democratic candidates had to say about the heartbreaking image of the drowned migrant father and daughter at the US-Mexico border: On the lighter side of congressional news, transportation committee members raced scooters on capitol hill today. Hey all, Vivian Ho here for a SUPER BRIEF live blog before the first of the Democratic primary debates. Hope everyone\u2019s jazzed. With that I bid you a good afternoon, as Vivian Ho comes on board to take you through the rest of the day until our Adam Gabbatt fires up late live blog coverage of the Democratic primary debate from south Florida tonight. Here are a few key things you may have missed today: The House and Senate have both passed bills which provide in the neighborhood of $4.5bn in funding to address the crisis on the border, but it\u2019s unclear how lawmakers expect to square the competing proposals. A Buzzfeed News investigation found that US investigators have found dismal conditions at migrant camps, similar to the ones that have been described in recent news accounts. More or less the whole Democratic field of contenders took trips to a detention camp in south Florida Wednesday ahead of this evening\u2019s debate. Two Republican Senators have come out and said that new rape claims against Donald Trump should be investigated. Also, Donald Trump (surprise, surprise) made a laundry list of off-color and meanspirited remarks today, during a televised interview and a speech at the Faith and Freedom Coalition. They included: Seeming excitement at the prospect of the late Senator John McCain spending eternity in damnation Threatening to fire his Federal Reserve Chairman Calling German chancellor Angela Merkel \u201csomeone who hates the United States perhaps worse than any person I\u2019ve ever met\u201d... Which is pretty weird because he\u2019s definitely met Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-Un. Attacking a US women\u2019s soccer player Joking about using his office to \u201cgo after\u201d political rivals All before heading off for Japan this afternoon. Hundreds of people out to demonstrate in Boston in solidarity with Wayfair workers who walked out over their company\u2019s decision to sell furniture for use in migrant detention centers. Senator and presidential hopeful Cory Booker is calling for hearings on reports of ICE using solitary confinement in migrant detention camps, often against mentally ill persons, and detainees who hadn\u2019t violated any rules. In a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, Booker cites May reports by NBC News and The Intercept that ICE placed thousands of immigrants in solitary confinement between 2012 and 2017. ICE\u2019s own policy seems to recognize the dangers of solitary confinement. The policy states that the \u2018[p]lacement of detainees in segregated housing is a serious step that requires careful consideration of alternatives... In particular, placement in administrative segregation due to a special vulnerability should be used only as a last resort and when no other viable housing options exist.\u2019\u201d -Cory Booker The Senate passed its own border supplement bill Wednesday with strong bipartisan support after the House passed one last night on a much tighter margin. Both bills allocate funding to address the humanitarian crisis, but the two pieces of legislation differ substantially in the details. The House bill has more constraints than the Senate version on how the Trump administration would use the money, leaving the next step unclear. Congressional leaders hope to send President Donald Trump a compromise measure before lawmakers leave town for a July 4 recess. Senate Majority leader McConnell and House Speaker Pelosi have both said reaching some type of legislative solution is a high priority. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is reportedly planning a vote on a bipartisan amendment to the country\u2019s current defense authorization legislation that would \u201cprohibit funds from being used for military operations against Iran without explicit authorization from Congress.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s time for Congress to step up to our constitutional responsibilities before we find ourselves in another unnecessary and endless war in the Middle East,\u201d said Democratic Senator Tom Udall, one of the sponsors. \u201cWe need to stand up and take the hard votes. Our troops face live fire and sacrifice their lives \u2013 and we should have no sympathy for Congress ducking a vote on whether or not we go to war. Congress has not authorized war with Iran, and we need to make sure that saber rattling and miscalculation don\u2019t spark a catastrophic conflict, before it\u2019s too late.\u201d Democratic Senator Tim Kaine added: \u201cIt\u2019s time we have a real conversation on the Senate floor about what another war in the Middle East would do to our troops and the safety of the American people at home. This amendment is a guardrail to prevent Trump from unilaterally starting a war with Iran.\u201d Rand Paul, a Republican, is also a sponsor. \u201cEducation clearly has not been at the top of his list of priorities to address directly, but he has been very supportive of all the work that we\u2019ve done,\u201d DeVos said Wednesday in an interview with Denver radio station KDMT. \u201cI have a great relationship with the president,\u201d DeVos continued. \u201cAnd he has been very supportive of and encouraging of all of the initiatives that we\u2019ve undertaken.\u201d From Politico: DeVos\u2019 relationship with Trump was thrust into the spotlight earlier this year after the controversy over proposed funding cuts for the Special Olympics. DeVos publicly defended the administration\u2019s proposal for days until Trump suddenly reversed course, declaring that he had \u201coverridden my people.\u201d Earlier this month, Trump appeared to side with West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice in the governor\u2019s rift with DeVos and GOP legislators over charter schools and education savings account programs in the state. Online home goods retailer Wayfair sold roughly 1,600 mattresses and 100 bunk beds to Baptist Child and Family Services, a nonprofit that works as a federal contractor managing some of the camps along the southern border, according to a copy of the sales receipt obtained by CNBC and verified by an employee to the station. Wayfair employees staged a walkout Wednesday afternoon at its headquarters in Boston while many customers called for a boycott on social media. The announcement earlier today that Wayfair would donate profits from related sales to the Red Cross also haven\u2019t gone over particularly well on Twitter. According to the Daily Beast, Reddit quarantined the \u201cThe_Donald\u201d subreddit on Wednesday, \u201cciting threats made on the popular forum for Trump supporters against law enforcement officers.\u201d \u201cRecent behaviors including threats against the police and public figures is content that is prohibited by our violence policy,\u201d a Reddit spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cAs a result, we have actioned individual users and quarantined the subreddit.\u201d World Cup winner Ali Krieger has thrown her support behind fellow USA soccer alum Megan Rapinoe in her spat with Donald Trump. The Daily Beast has compiled a friendly reminder of what candidates ought NOT to do at tonight\u2019s Democratic debate. Let\u2019s take a walk down memory lane, shall we? Rough start for former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper. Justice Neil Gorsuch continued his trend of joining his generally more liberal US Supreme Court colleagues in certain criminal cases, reports Bloomberg Law. Gorsuch wrote the court\u2019s opinion, released Wednesday, siding with a man convicted of child pornography offenses who faced more prison time for violating supervised release. From Bloomberg Law: Though a more reliably conservative vote in other areas\u2014and in criminal cases involving death row prisoners\u2014it\u2019s the latest instance of Gorsuch applying a limited government mentality to help convicts on appeal. Just this week, he cast the tie-breaking vote for the defense in another criminal case, and earlier this term provided the liberals with a fifth vote in decisions favoring American Indian rights. Thirty miles south of where Elizabeth Warren will take the stage on Wednesday night for the first of two presidential primary debates, the Massachusetts senator climbed a ladder to peer over a chain-link fence enclosing a detention center for young migrants. From her vantage point, Warren said a sprawling campus with massive white tents, metal trailers, a soccer field \u2013 and organized in single file lines, the children and young adults who are being housed at the facility in Homestead, Florida. \u201cThese were children who were being marched like they were soldiers - like they were prisoners - from one place to another,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThis is not what we should be doing as a country. These children did not commit a crime. These children pose no threat.\u201d The facility, which is run by Comprehensive Health Services, Inc., a private, for-profit company, has become a backdrop for Democratic presidential hopefuls to rail against Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies while in Miami, a city known as the capital of Latin America\u201d where more than 70% of the population is Hispanic, located in Florida, one of country\u2019s most important battleground states. Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar arrived on the scene shortly after Warren departed and Jane Sanders, the wife of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, also joined protesters on Wednesday. Democratic hopefuls Beto O\u2019Rourke and author Marianne Williamson were due to visit later this week. California congressman Eric Swallwell documented his visit here on Monday: \u201cThese children need homes, NOT a privatized prison,\u201d he said on Twitter. Their visits come after photos were published of a father and his toddler daughter face down in the Rio Grande river, where they drowned trying to cross the border to seek asylum in the United States and amid a fresh found of reports about the conditions that children are being kept in at Border Patrol stations near the border. Lawyers who had visited the facilities said children were being kept without adequate food, water or basic sanitary needs such as toothpaste and soap. \u201cWhat is happening at Homestead to children \u2013 what is happening is the direct result of activities of the United States government is wrong,\u201d Warren told a sweat-soaked crush of activists and reporters said Warren. \u201cIt is a stain on our country and we must speak out.\u201d Warren, who wore a hat with the message \u201cHome Instead\u201d, touted her plan to ban private, for-profit prisons and detention centers. = The senator was not scheduled to visit the facility, but added the stop after hearing from activists ahead of her town hall in Miami on Tuesday night. Jane Sanders told the Guardian it was \u201cheartbreaking\u201d to see the facility firsthand. She said Sanders first executive order as president would be to close the private detention facilities. She also that her husband had voted against legislation in that led to the creation of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency in 2002. \u201cEverything that he feared has come true,\u201d she said, referring to the agency, \u201cand it needs to be abolished. We need a complete overhaul of our immigration system.\u201d Trump tells CNN reporter that what he speaks about with Vladimir Putin is \u201cnone of your business.\u201d Politico reporter Eliana Johnson says that, per a senior Democratic aide, House Speaker Pelosi and President Trump spoke this afternoon for 15 minutes. \u201cThe Speaker placed the call to the President to try to reconcile the House and Senate border supplementals.\u201d Buzzfeed News is reporting that the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Office of Inspector General found atrocious conditions in migrant detention facilities including \u201cstanding room only\u201d living space, and little access to hot showers or food. From Buzzfeed: When Department of Homeland Security inspectors visited several border facilities in the Rio Grande Valley earlier this month, they found adults and minors with no access to showers, many adults only fed bologna sandwiches, and detainees banging on cell windows \u2014 desperately pressing notes to the windows of their cells that detailed their time in custody. The inspectors compiled a draft report, obtained by BuzzFeed News, that described the conditions as dangerous and prolonged. Some adults were held in standing-room conditions for a week. There was little access to hot showers or hot food for families and children in some facilities. Some kids were being held in closed cells. There was severe overcrowding. The draft report was written by the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Office of Inspector General and addressed to the acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan. It comes after inspectors visited five border facilities and two ports of entry during the week of June 10. It appears to have been sent to DHS officials last week for comments and requests for redactions before being released publicly. \u201cSpecifically, we are recommending that the Department of Homeland Security take immediate steps to alleviate dangerous overcrowding and prolonged detention of children and adults in the Rio Grande Valley,\u201d wrote Jennifer Costello, acting inspector general. Trump, speaking at the Faith and Freedom Coalition Wednesday, seemed to suggest that he believes the late Senator John McCain is in hell, and that this idea brings him some joy. \u201cWe needed 60 votes. And we had 51 votes. And sometimes, you know, we had a little hard time with a couple of them, right,\u201d Trump said, which could be alluding to any of a few Senators who sometimes bucked Trump on bills, including former Senators Jeff Flake and Bob Corker.\u201d Trump continued: \u201cFortunately, they\u2019re gone now. They\u2019ve gone on to greener pastures. Or perhaps far less green pastures... They\u2019re gone. I\u2019m very happy they\u2019re gone.\u201d It takes a little bit of extrapolating, and Trump has plausible deniability if the comments attract widespread condemnation. But Trump\u2019s well-known, petty dislike for John McCain seems to point in his remarks having a particularly morose and nasty meaning. Trump made some light humor on authoritarianism to reporters Wednesday, saying that his administration wouldn\u2019t be enforcing the Johnson Amendment on pastors \u201cunless they speak against me, in which case I\u2019ll bring it back,\u201d before adding that he was \u201conly kidding\u201d. The Johnson Amendment prohibits all 501(c)(3) organizations, including houses of worship, from endorsing political candidates. Former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort is expected to be arraigned tomorrow at approximately 2:15pm before Judge Maxwell Wiley in Manhattan, Courthouse News\u2019 Adam Klasfeld is reporting. Manafort is currently in prison after having pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United States and witness tampering in federal court in September. The charges in New York are unrelated mortgage fraud charges. Unlike the crimes he pleaded guilty to in the federal case, Manafort could not rely on a presidential pardon to eventually clear him in New York. From NBC Chicago: The Chicago bar whose employee spit on Eric Trump Tuesday night said in a statement that the employee in question has been placed on leave, calling the incident \u201cunfortunate\u201d and its fallout \u201ctroubling.\u201d \u201cLast night an unfortunate incident occurred between an employee at The Aviary and Eric Trump,\u201d began The Aviary\u2019s statement, released Wednesday morning. \u201cWe did not witness the incident and we are just beginning to learn the details.\u201d \u201cWhat is certain is this: no customer should ever be spit upon,\u201d the Fulton Market cocktail lounge continued. Multiple sources told NBC 5 that Eric Trump, the son of President Donald Trump, was a patron of the upscale cocktail lounge at around 8:30 p.m. when an employee approached and spit on him. Eric Trump later confirmed the incident in a statement to NBC News. We have not yet spoken with the employee but our HR team has, in the meantime, placed her on leave,\u201d The Aviary\u2019s statement continued, adding that the establishment would not discuss internal HR matters any further. More broadly, the online discussion about the incident is troubling,\u201d The Aviary continued, adding, \u201cHundreds of people are calling for the demise of our business, threatening our employees, and posting fake reviews... they are wrong to do so based on the actions of a lone individual. So too, however, are those people wrong who are praising this as an act of civil disobedience/ We have voices and the means to be heard. A degrading act lowers the tenor of debate. To some it might feel good, but it is unlikely to serve any larger purpose.\u201d We hope this incident can, at least, serve to illuminate the current absurdity of the discourse in our politics,\u201d the bar\u2019s statement concluded. \u201cAs fellow Americans and citizens, we should all aim higher.\u201d -The Aviary As conditions in migrant detention camps remain a contentious and hotly debated topic, 2020 Democratic candidates are jockeying Wednesday to bring attention to, and/or plant a flag in the issue- depending on your level of cynicism. Elizabeth Warren paid a visit to the Homestead detention facility outside Miami earlier this morning after a voter enccouraged her to show up during a town hall last night. Bernie Sanders\u2019 wife Jane is also at Homestead, telling reporters that closing detention facilities would be her husband\u2019s first executive order as president. Senators Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar also announced they would be visiting Homestead today. The Democratic candidates are all in south Florida in advance of the first primary debate scheduled for this evening. House Oversight chairman Jerry Nadler doesn\u2019t seem especially concerned about a White House attempt to block Robert Mueller from testifying next month. Wayfair, the mega online furniture retailer, is reportedly backing down in a standoff with its employees over having accepted orders from the US government for items used in migrant detention camps. The company had initially issued a statement which read in part: As a retailer, it is standard practice to fulfill orders for all customers and we believe it is our business to sell to any customer who is acting within the laws of the countries within which we operate. We believe all of our stakeholders, employees, customers, investors and suppliers included, are best served by our commitment to fulfill all orders. This does not indicate support for the opinions or actions of the groups or individuals who purchase from us. But pressure was mounting, not only from employees who staged a walkout Tuesday, but across social media where customers and potential customers were threatening boycotts. It remains unclear whether the announcement will satisfy either group. A House committee voted Wednesday to authorize a subpoena for White House counselor Kellyanne Conway after she failed to show for a hearing on a government watchdog\u2019s findings that she broke the law dozens of times. Conway is skipping the hearings with the support of White House lawyers. Oversight committee chairman Elijah Cummings has warned that his panel would vote to hold Conway in contempt if she ignores the subpoena. From The Washington Post: The House Oversight Committee voted, 25-to-16, for the subpoena after Special Counsel Henry Kerner said she blatantly violated the Hatch Act, a law that bars federal employees from engaging in politics during work. \u201cMs. Conway\u2019s egregious and repeated Hatch Act violations, combined with her unrepentant attitude, are unacceptable from any federal employee, let along one in such a prominent position,\u201d Kerner told the panel. \u201cHer conduct hurts both federal employees, who may believe that senior officials can act with complete disregard for the Hatch Act, and the American people, who may question the nonpartisan operation of their government.\u201d In an interview shared yesterday, USA soccer player Megan Rapinoe scoffed at the notion of going to the White House in the event of a potential Women\u2019s World Cup victory. Trump heard and responded characteristically, in a series of Tweets: Women\u2019s soccer player, @mPinoe, just stated that she is \u201cnot going to the F...ing White House if we win.\u201d Other than the NBA, which now refuses to call owners, owners (please explain that I just got Criminal Justice Reform passed, Black unemployment is at the lowest level... in our Country\u2019s history, and the poverty index is also best number EVER), leagues and teams love coming to the White House. I am a big fan of the American Team, and Women\u2019s Soccer, but Megan should WIN first before she TALKS! Finish the job! We haven\u2019t yet...invited Megan or the team, but I am now inviting the TEAM, win or lose. Megan should never disrespect our Country, the White House, or our Flag, especially since so much has been done for her &amp; the team. Be proud of the Flag that you wear. The USA is doing GREAT!\u201d One problem. Trump initially tweeted his reply to the wrong account. The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s air chief\u2014who has been leading the Trump administration\u2019s rollbacks of rules for pollution and climate change\u2014is departing amid a congressional probe of a possible ethics violation. Bill Wehrum, a lawyer who has represented energy interests, came under scrutiny after meeting with two former clients and taking part in a decision in favor of a former client, the power company DTE Energy, according to the Washington Post. EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler did not say why Wehrum is leaving but commended him for \u201chis service, his dedication to his job, the leadership he provided to his staff and the agency, and for his friendship.\u201d Wehrum was confirmed in November 2017. Two Republican senators said Tuesday the sexual assault allegation made against President Donald Trump by writer E Jean Carroll should be investigated, while most of the party has mostly ignored the claims or defended the president. From CNN: Joni Ernst of Iowa said Trump and Carroll should be questioned about the alleged assault. \u201cI think anybody that makes an accusation like that, they should come forward,\u201d Ernst said when asked if Carroll should be believed. \u201cBut obviously there has to be some additional information. They need to interview her. They need to visit with him.\u201d Mitt Romney of Utah said there needs to be an \u201cevaluation\u201d but that he didn\u2019t know what entity should conduct it, \u201cwhether it\u2019s Congress or whether it\u2019s another setting, I\u2019m not sure. \u201cIt\u2019s a very serious allegation,\u201d Romney said. \u201cI hope that it is fully evaluated. The president said it didn\u2019t happen and I certainly hope that\u2019s the case.\u201d Ernst shared in January that she herself is a survivor of sexual assault. A Senate hearing on the \u201cunprecedented migration at the US southern border\u201d is just getting underway and you can watch live here. Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson, chairman of the committee holding the hearing, said in his opening remarks: \u201cWe\u2019ll hear stories of [migrants who] probably have already been placed into involuntary servitude. We have records of people being beaten, and videos taken and sent back down to their home countries demanding payment.\u201d Johnson expressed concerns that the system for processing migrants at the southern border is completely overwhelmed, sentiments that were echoed by Brian Hastings, Chief of the Law Enforcement Operations Directorate of US Border Patrol. \u201cThree weeks into the month, we\u2019ve already passed the apprehension level for every June since 2007,\u201d Hastings said. \u201cThe flow continues to overwhelm resources throughout the immigration system.\u201d The hearings come as a photograph of a father and his 23-month-old daughter face down along the banks of the Rio Grande is being published around the world as a grisly representation of the dangers that migrants face on the border. The Hill is reporting that Code Pink activists have been granted a permit to fly the \u201cBaby Trump balloon\u201d just blocks from the White House during Trump\u2019s July 4 celebration. With news coming yesterday that special council Robert Mueller will be testifying before Congress next month, Trump took his televised interview as a chance to make unfounded broadsides at him \u2013 accusing him of illegally disposing of evidence during the investigation. Trump rules out replacing his vice-president, Mike Pence, with former UN ambassador Nikki Haley, as a Wall Street Journal op-ed suggested Trump ought to do earlier this week. I love Nikki, she\u2019s endorsed me, she\u2019s my friend, but Mike has been a great Vice President...I love Nikki...but you can\u2019t break up a team like us, we get along together.\u201d -Donald Trump on running mate questions. On the escalating tensions between the US and Iran after a US drone was shot down last week Trump says he \u201chopes\u201d the two countries don\u2019t go to war, but \u201cwe are in a very strong position\u2026 it would not last long\u2026 I\u2019m not talking boots on the ground\u2026 just saying if something happened it wouldn\u2019t last long.\u201d Good morning and welcome to the politics live blog for Wednesday the 26th of June. We kick off this morning with Fox Business Network, where Donald Trump started off the morning by attacking his Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, on national television. Trump\u2019s remarks came in the midst of a wide-ranging interview with host Maria Bartiromo. he president Trump and Powell have been at loggerheads over the chairman\u2019s raising of interest rates while Powell has made a public display of touting the bank\u2019s independence from the president\u2019s wishes. Other recipients of Trump attacks this morning include Twitter, Trump\u2019s preferred means of public communication, who he says is \u201cbiased\u201d against him, Google, who Trump says is \u201ctrying to rig the election\u201d and German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who, without mentioning her by name, Trump claims \u201chates the United States perhaps worse than any person I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d",

But know that being at home brings its own pressure, especially if you\u2019re an Egyptian footballer. The Pharaohs kicked off their campaign with a 1-0 win over Zimbabwe last Friday and although they showed glimpses of thrilling fluency, their performance left plenty of room for improvement. Even Mohamed Salah fell below the standard demanded, as his attempt to influence that match was frustrated by a combination of strong defending by Divine Lunga and uncharacteristically hefty touches by Salah himself. Egypt\u2019s manager, Javier Aguirre, said Salah arrived a little jaded from his epic season with Liverpool but will grow into this tournament. Let\u2019s hope so, for the sake of the spectacle. He also said Salah may be deployed in a central striking role today, as opposed to on the right wing, where he began against Zimbabwe. If that works, then expect him to fire Egypt towards the victory that will confirm their presence in the last 16.</p> <p><strong>While Egypt fans want to see a little more from their side, supporters of DR Congo must wonder when their team is going to turn up at all</strong>. The Leopards were catastrophic in their first outing, deservedly beaten 2-0 by Uganda. It was the worst performance of any team in the tournament so far because they played like a senseless rabble, which was surprising from a team managed by Florent Ibenge. The Congolese collective malfunctioned and so too did their individuals: while Salah failed to shine for Egypt, Congo\u2019s star player, C\u00e9dric Bakambu, stood out for his sheer awfulness. Yannick Bolasie was only marginally better. If the Leopards don\u2019t pull themselves together and harness the talent they clearly possession, they\u2019ll be on their way home real soon. A draw might do for them today \u2013 although that would leave them needing to beat Zimbabwe, who took four points off them in qualifying, so a win here would be much better. Ibenge has vowed to attack. </p> <p><strong>Let\u2019s be having you!</strong> </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-26T17:44:03.467Z\">at 6.44pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Mohamed Salah scored his first goal of this year\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations to help hosts Egypt to a 2-0 win over Democratic Republic of Congo which guaranteed them a place in the knockout stages. Aston Villa full-back Ahmed Elmohamady broke the deadlock in the 25th minute, turning the ball in following a corner before Salah netted two minutes before half-time. The Liverpool forward finished clinically from Trezeguet\u2019s pass to send the packed Cairo International Stadium wild with delight. The result was perhaps harsh on the Congolese, who twice hit the crossbar in the first half. Jonathan Bolingi\u2019s header rattled the woodwork moments before Salah scored, while Marcel Tisserand missed the chance to put the Leopards ahead after connecting with Bolingi\u2019s flick-on 11 minutes on. With two defeats from two games, DR Congo must now hope to beat Zimbabwe and squeeze through from third place. Egypt face Uganda in their final game, needing only a draw to secure top spot in Group A. Reuters The hosts march into the last 16 - as group winners if they can avoid defeat to Uganda in their third match. They did not sparkle here - except when scoring their second goal, created by a great run by Trezeguet and finished beautifully by Salah. But they were efficient when it mattered, and were helped by a bit of luck, particularly when DR Congo struck the bar twice. The Leopards played better than in their first match but are left with only a remote chance of creeping into the next round as one of the best third-best placed teams. 90+2 min: Bolasie\u2019s weak shot from the left is diverted just over the bar by Bakambu from eight yards. 90 min: DR Congo have at times been woefully rash around the box, firing off outlandish shots when there were several better options. No wonder Egypt have been confident they could spend the last half hour protecting their lead. 88 min: Salah gets a chance to run at the defence, all on his own versus three opponents. He makes it into the box but his shot is smothered as soon as it leaves his foot. 87 min: Ghazal marks his arrival by chopping down Bakambu. The ref writes his name in his naughty book. 86 min: Bolasie has a go from an improbable angle and distance. Alaa takes no chances and diverts it out for a corner. It\u2019s badly delivered. Egypt substitution: Ghazal on, Trezeguet off after a fine performance, notably his contribution to Salah\u2019s goal. 83 min: Ooooh! Bolasie rasps the freekick around the six-man wall and the goalkeeper ... but inches wide of the far post. 82 min: Bolaise threads a pass through to Bakambu, who goes down at the edge of the box under a tackle from Alaa. Freekick to DR Congo ... and only a yellow card for Alaa... 80 min: Bolasie gallops down the right ... and wafts a cross into no-man\u2019s-land. 78 min: Important interception by Hegazi to prevent Bolasie from getting through on goal. DR Congo will try from a corner instead. Bakambu\u2019s header is booted away three yards shy of the line. 76 min: Issama sends over his best cross of the match, and Bolingi meets it with a towering header from eight yards, rising high above Hegazi. El Shenawy shows rapid reflexes and a strong hand to make a terrific save low to his right! 74 min: Maghoma has played well. Hemakes good ground through midfield before fizzing a low pass in to Bakambu, who does well to turn and shoot, albeit without enough power to beat the keeper from 20 yards. 73 min: Salah comes deep to collect the ball inside his own half. Then he spins and drives forward at high speed. His pass fails to find a man, as quite often in this tournament. But at no point could his work-rate be doubted. The man is going to need a good long holiday before resuming Premier League action next season (same for Man\u00e9). 71 min: Issama sears forward down the right but then gets his delivery wrong. 70 min: Bakambu has a go from nigh-on 30 yards but gets nowhere near the target. That pretty much sums up his tournament so far. He\u2019s been desperately disappointing. 68 min: Elneny booked for wrapping his legs around those of Bolasie from behind and forcing the winger to the ground. That was dangerous and should have been punished with a red. Egypt substitution: Solimon off, Mohsen off 66 min: Elneny feeds Salah, who loses control but then fights to win it back, poking it through to Trezeguet, whose low shot from 16 yards hurtles into the sidenetting. 64 min: Egypt have retreated quite deep in the last few minutes, seemingly happy to let DR Congo try to infiltrate them, and confident they can fend off those attempts. DR Congo substitution: Bolasie on, Bop\u00e9 off. 63 min: Bakambu retrieves a raking pass from deep by Bop\u00e9, then lays it back to Elia. Hegazi rises high to head the in-swinging cross clear. 61 min: Elmohamady\u2019s attempt at trickery deep in his own territory backfires and he\u2019s robbed by Elia. But DR Congo\u2019s attack soon peters out. Egypt substitution: Hassan on, Mohsen off. 59 min: Ngona booked for crashing to El Said near half way, driving his studs into the players thigh, perhaps accidentally. The break in play might enable Egypt to regain their composure after a couple of minutes of highly-strung defending. 58 min: Good play by DR Congo, who are now attacking with urgency and putting Egypt under lots of pressure. A breakthrough now would make the last half hour of this very interesting ... 56 min: Maghoma pings a low cross towards the near post. Bakambu tries to turns it goalward but doesn\u2019t get a good enough touch. 54 min: Salah balloons a corner all the way out of play beyond the far post. 53 min: El Said, picking up the ball wide on the left, smuggles it through to Salah, who skips forward and tries to nip it through to Mohsen. But Luyindama reads his intentions and cuts it out. 52 min: Issama fires a cross in from the right, and watches it fly out of play on the far side. 51 min: Luyindama barges into the back of Salah, conceding a freekick midway inside his own half and copping the wrath of the entire crowd. 49 min: Meschak has a pop from 25 yards. But his gentle curler is comfortably saved by El Shenawy. 48 min: A shot by Salah is charged down at the edge of the area, but moments later he\u2019s threatening again, laying the ball off to El Said and darting into the box for the return pass. But it\u2019s overhit. DR Congo substitution: Elia on, Mputu off. 46 min: I trust the players took plenty of water on board during the interval, because there weren\u2019t any water breaks during the first half. There have been very few in the tournament so far despite the supposed encouragement to let the players rehydrate in the intense heat. Odd. As a spectacle it\u2019s been turbo-charged fun so far, but DR Congo will see nothing to smile about the fact that they trail by two goals after hitting the crossbar twice themselves. They\u2019ve played well, but Egypt have been the more clinical and are en route to the knockout stages unless the Leopards produce something special in the second half. The Cairo crowd go wild! That\u2019s what they came to see! Little had been going right for Salah so far in the tournament but that\u2019s all changed now. His finish was splendid and big thanks are due to Trezeguet, who created the chance with a jagged run in-field from the left and and a cute pass through to Salah. The forward was left with one defender to beat from the edge of the area, and he feinted to curl it around Tisserand but then banged it past him on the near side, fooling the keeper! 41 min: The Leopards have twice shown their ability to pose problems to the Egyptian defence in the air, so it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to launch a few more into the mixer. 39 min: Maghoma clips a pass towards the back post. Bop\u00e9 heads it back towards the centre, where Bolingi outjumps the defender six yards out and nods it over the keeper ... and onto the crossbar! That\u2019s the second time it\u2019s been rattled by DR Congo! 35 min: Snazzy interplay by DR Congo, zipping forward with a sequence of one-touch passes. But that only takes them to within a roar of the Egyptian box, and then the Pharaohs win the ball back and romp forward themselves. If the final cross had not been too long, Salah would surely have scored at the back post. 33 min: Elmohamady penalised for shoving Maghoma as the pair competed for an aerial ball. Mputu fancies the freekick, which is about 23 yards out, near the left-hand corner of the box. Mputu dabs it over the wall, inviting his runners to throw themselves at it. Tisserand does exactly that ... and goes tantalisingly close to getting a killer touch! Instead the ball drifts wide of the far post. 31 min: Salah lashes a curling freekick around the wall, but is denied by Matampi, who gets both hands on it and beats it away to safety. 29 min: Mohsen comes a cropper just outside the Congolese D following a rugged tackle by Bop\u00e9, who\u2019s booked and therefore ruled out of the next match. And Egypt have a chance to make him pay even more, as the freekick is well placed... 27 min: Tisserand does well to stretch out a leg and intercept Mohsen\u2019s attempted through-ball for Salah. In truth, Mohsen\u2019s pass lacked power: he should have been able to release Salah. Egypt, though, are playing with more vibrancy now that they\u2019ve got the lead. Can the Leopards mount a fightback? They started the game well so will be aghast at falling behind. 25 min: Salah played a key role in that goal. The corner from the right as taken short to him and then he pinged a vicious cross into the danger zone. Elomahady and Luyindula challenged for it and when the ball rebounded off bodies and back into the path of Elmohamady, he fired low into the net. A corner triggers panic in the Congolese box, and when the ball breaks to Elmohamady, he stabs home from seven yards! 21 min: Elneny slips a pass through to Salah a few yards outside the box. Salah tries to dribble his way into a shooting position but runs straight into trouble and is relieved of the ball through an ungainly tackle, which many in the stadium construed as a foul. Not the ref, though. 20 min: After lots of sideways passing, Egypt run short of ideas, so El Said hangs up a high ball into the box from near half-way. Easy pickings for the keeper. 17 min: DR Congo have succeeded in knocking Egypt off their stride. The Pharoahs circulate the ball patiently at the back but as soon as they approach the Congolese half they find the going a lot tougher. And the Leopards are primed to tear forward as soon as they win back the ball. It\u2019s a gripping contest. 15 min: Egypt build methodically from the back, working it slowly but surely to Salah, who immediately gives it away. It\u2019s just not happening for him so far in this tournament. 13 min:Bolingi knows he can\u2019t reach a lofted cross into the box but carries on his run so that he clatters into the keeper. It\u2019s a freekick out, but a useful warning served to the keeper that if he comes for crosses, he can expect a collision. The Leopards are on a mission here: they haven\u2019t come to play the polite guests. 11 min: Hegazi concedes another corner, nudging the ball out of play after a long throw-in was flicked on to the near post. This time Mputu\u2019s delivery is a peach and very nearly bears even better fruit. It was flicked on at the near post by Bolingi, and Tisserand, straining to reach it, touches it on to the crossbar from three yards! 9 min: Moke\u2019s cross from the right is put out for a corner by Hegazi. Mputu delivers but Trezeguet heads to safety. 6 min: Already the Leopards look far more coherent than they did in their opening game. They\u2019re functioning like a unit, choosing when to press Egypt and doing it well. But Egypt are still enjoying the majority of possession... 4 min: A slack Congolese pass out from defence is intercepted and sent straight forward for Salah to chase. He latches on to it and finds himself bearing down on goal! Tisserand stretches out a foot to get a nick to Salah\u2019s shot from the edge o the box, deflecting it narrowly wide! 3 min: Ashraf intercepts a long pass from the back but then loops a weak header to Mputu, who lets fly with a volley from 20 yards. It\u2019s well struck but straight at El Shenawy. 2 min: Salah is operating from the right wing but hasn\u2019t had a touch yet. However, Trezeguet has already showed his menace from the other flank with a dangerous raid towards the box. But he was dispossessed before he got there. 1 min: There\u2019s a thrum of anticipation around the stadium as DR Congo kick off ... The teams enter the Cairo arena, which is of course full to its 60,000 capacity, and overwhelmingly red. DR Congo, meanwhile, are clad in magnificent all white kit with light blue trims across the neck and shoulders and a leopard silhouette on the belly. It\u2019s quality clobber, and no mistake. Nick Ames has more on that expulsion of Amr Warda from Egypt\u2019s squad. Sounds like the player\u2019s got some serious explaining to do. Proof that DR Congo know how to make an entrance ... There\u2019s a hint of Loi-era Koffi Olomide about that arrival (minus the France jerseys, obviously)... Hegazi has overcome his fitness worries and will start in central defence. Salah looks like he\u2019ll start on the right again, with Mohsen in the centre. Amr Warda is notably by his absence from the bench, having been ejected from the squad today for an undisclosed breach of discipline (reference has been made to unwholesome social media exchanges). For the Leopards, the Premier League players Bolasie and Masuaku have been dropped, as has the former Premier LEague player Mbemba. Bolingi, Maghoma and Moke. Egypt: El Shenawy; Elmohamady, Hegazi, Slaa, Ashraf; Elneny, El Said, Hamed; Salah, Mohsen, Trezeguet Subs: Gennesh, Gaber, El-Wensh, Mansour, Elmohamady, Soliman, Dunga, Ali, Kouka DR Congo: Matampi; Issama, Luyindama, Ngonda, Tisserand; Bop\u00e9, Mputu, Moke; Maghoma, Bakambu, Bolingi Subs: Akolo, Mulumbu, Mpoku, Bolasie, Elia, Masuaku, Assombolanga, Ngawai, Shabani, Mbemba, Mandanda Referee: V Gomes (South Africa) Hello, welcome, please make yourselves at home. But know that being at home brings its own pressure, especially if you\u2019re an Egyptian footballer. The Pharaohs kicked off their campaign with a 1-0 win over Zimbabwe last Friday and although they showed glimpses of thrilling fluency, their performance left plenty of room for improvement. Even Mohamed Salah fell below the standard demanded, as his attempt to influence that match was frustrated by a combination of strong defending by Divine Lunga and uncharacteristically hefty touches by Salah himself. Egypt\u2019s manager, Javier Aguirre, said Salah arrived a little jaded from his epic season with Liverpool but will grow into this tournament. Let\u2019s hope so, for the sake of the spectacle. He also said Salah may be deployed in a central striking role today, as opposed to on the right wing, where he began against Zimbabwe. If that works, then expect him to fire Egypt towards the victory that will confirm their presence in the last 16. While Egypt fans want to see a little more from their side, supporters of DR Congo must wonder when their team is going to turn up at all. The Leopards were catastrophic in their first outing, deservedly beaten 2-0 by Uganda. It was the worst performance of any team in the tournament so far because they played like a senseless rabble, which was surprising from a team managed by Florent Ibenge. The Congolese collective malfunctioned and so too did their individuals: while Salah failed to shine for Egypt, Congo\u2019s star player, C\u00e9dric Bakambu, stood out for his sheer awfulness. Yannick Bolasie was only marginally better. If the Leopards don\u2019t pull themselves together and harness the talent they clearly possession, they\u2019ll be on their way home real soon. A draw might do for them today \u2013 although that would leave them needing to beat Zimbabwe, who took four points off them in qualifying, so a win here would be much better. Ibenge has vowed to attack. Let\u2019s be having you!",

The auditor general, Grant Hehir, has also found that the FMD scheme, which held more than $6.6bn in deposits in June 2018, does not have \u201cfully effective\u201d administration processes, risk identification or compliance measures in place. This is despite the amount of foregone revenue from the taxpayer-funded scheme more than doubling from $245m in 2016\u201317 to $500m in 2017\u201318.

A temperature of 38.6C was recorded on Wednesday in Coschen, near the Polish border, exceeding the country\u2019s previous June high, while rail tracks buckled near Rostock on the Baltic Sea. Sri Lanka\u2019s president has ordered the execution of four drug offenders, potentially ending a 43-year moratorium on capital punishment. Maithripala Sirisena, the president, said on Wednesday he had signed the death warrants. A Gambian pageant winner has accused the country\u2019s former president of rape as an investigation claims Yahya Jammeh systematically sexually abused young women. Jammeh, who reluctantly stepped down in 2017 after 22 years of rule, presented himself as a deeply religious figure and an advocate of girls\u2019 rights. Evidence is mounting that Parkinson\u2019s disease may start off in the gut. New research shows proteins thought to play a key role in the disease can spread from the gastrointestinal tract to the brain. More than 9 million people around the world play Candy Crush for between three and six hours \u2013 or more \u2013 a day, a top executive at the maker of the multibillion dollar game has revealed. Opinion and analysis With Israel Folau, the church is demanding a kind of free speech that keeps gays in the firing line, writes David Marr. \u201cThese Christians \u2013 by no means all Christians \u2013 are willing to burn up huge amounts of political capital to keep and, if possible extend, their power to punish homosexuals. It\u2019s a weird pivot of their faith. This is not all they want the Morrison government to shore up with legislation, but it\u2019s at the core of their demands. They are shy of saying it in so many words, of course, hence all the malarkey we\u2019ve been hearing from them for the last couple of years about freedom. Here\u2019s a simple principle: being decent and kind requires no legislation. You only need a religious freedom act to shelter behind when you plan to be nasty \u2013 say to age-old targets of your wrath like gays.\u201d \u201cThe latest engineering construction figures show yet more evidence that Australia\u2019s economy has been struggling for nearly a year now, and that the public sector is failing to fill the gap of falling private sector infrastructure work,\u201d Greg Jericho writes. \u201cWhat a difference a year makes. This time last year I wrote of the latest engineering construction figures that \u2018infrastructure spending remains well below peak levels\u2019 but \u2018fortunately the level of public infrastructure spending has been rising very strongly\u2019. And now, with the latest release of the engineering construction figures by the Bureau of Statistics, we see that the volume of infrastructure work done for both the private and public sectors has declined for four straight quarters and is now at its lowest level since 2016.\u201d Sport Donald Trump has warned Megan Rapinoe not to \u201cdisrespect\u201d her country. Rapinoe, who has won the World Cup and Olympics, is outspoken on social issues and was the first white professional athlete to kneel for the national anthem in protest of social injustice in the United States, before US Soccer passed a rule requiring team members to stand for the anthem. Wallabies coach Michael Cheika has flagged his side will adopt a new style of attack following the departure of former attack coach Stephen Larkham, who claimed the pair had fundamental differences in their philosophies. The Wallabies\u2019 plan of attack at the World Cup later this year might be a case of \u201ceverything old is new again\u201d as Cheika goes back to his roots in an attempt to revitalise the team, which last year endured their worst season since 1958. Thinking time: \u2018I\u2019d put on a smiling face, then go home and fall apart\u2019 Saturday night on the banks of the Ohio River, and the most American of scenes is unfolding. At the Ball Park, the Cincinnati Reds are playing the Texas Rangers, while at the US Bank Arena next door Carrie Underwood is making the latest stop on her global tour. Fans spill together through the muggy streets, a mingling of scarlet baseball jerseys and tan cowboy boots. This is Underwood\u2019s first tour since 2016, a huge two-hour, 60-date monolith of a show in support of last year\u2019s album Cry Pretty. It must be a strange time for such a quintessentially American artist to be visiting the wider world, especially one who is white, southern and religious. \u201cI feel like more people try to pin me places politically,\u201d she says carefully. \u201cI try to stay far out of politics if possible, at least in public, because nobody wins. It\u2019s crazy. Everybody tries to sum everything up and put a bow on it, like it\u2019s black and white. And it\u2019s not like that.\u201d Media roundup The Sydney Morning Herald reports that NSW Labor leadership hopeful Chris Minns \u201caccepted a banned donation from a Labor party fixer and property developer Bechara Khouri in the lead-up to his election to parliament.\u201d The Age\u2019s front page story this morning is Australia leads bid to sideline America. The headline Final act: Call the G-G appears above a photograph of a downcast Malcolm Turnbull on the Australian\u2019s front page, as the paper reveals that: \u201cThe day before Malcolm Turnbull was deposed, the prime minister clashed with attorney general Christian Porter over a last-ditch plan to save his leadership by persuading governor general Peter Cosgrove not to commission Peter Dutton as prime minister.\u201d Coming up US Democrats are preparing for their first showdown as the 2020 debates loom. 20 presidential hopefuls will go head-to-head in Miami on 26 and 27 June.

      "body": "<p>When <a href=\"https://www.benweatherill.com/about-me\">Ben Weatherill</a> set out to write a romantic comedy, the first thing he did was ask himself: \u201cWho do we not see fall in love very often?\u201d</p> <p>Disabled people are underrepresented in the genre, characters with learning disabilities even less so. Weatherill consulted <a href=\"https://www.mencap.org.uk/learning-disability-explained/research-and-statistics/sexuality\">Mencap</a> and discovered that 3% of people with a learning disability live as a couple, compared with 70% of the general adult population. He decided to write a play about someone who is neurodiverse and someone who is neurotypical falling in love. Jellyfish was the result. First seen at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jul/03/jellyfish-review-bush-theatre-london\">London\u2019s Bush theatre last year</a>, it is now about to open at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/national-theatre\">National Theatre</a>.</p> <p>The play is set in Skegness and depicts the relationship between Kelly and Neil.

Gordy and Weatherill became close and their friendship informed the character of Kelly. \u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot from you,\u201d Weatherill says to her when the three of us meet. He looks at her and grins. \u201cYou tell me to pull my socks up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love how Ben\u2019s brain works,\u201d says Gordy, \u201cand I love being Kelly. She\u2019s strong, witty and funny.\u201d</p> <p>Gordy wanted to act from a young age and used to perform with her sister to entertain the family. \u201cI love to have characters in my head. When I don\u2019t, I feel empty,\u201d she says. She loves Shakespeare. As You Like It is a particular favourite \u2013 she thinks she\u2019d make a good Phoebe.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10b6d6e07b4636dad6cb5844da9a5555dd1a0d6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10b6d6e07b4636dad6cb5844da9a5555dd1a0d6a/0_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It might make people uncomfortable\u2019 \u2026 Ben Weatherill\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It might make people uncomfortable\u2019 \u2026 Ben Weatherill</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Both Weatherill and Gordy acknowledge that Jellyfish is a \u201ctricky, knotty\u201d play. It offers no easy answers. \u201cIt might make people uncomfortable,\u201d he says. The play doesn\u2019t shy away from the questions of consent, power and agency at its core, questions about who gets to make the decisions about Kelly\u2019s romantic life.</p> <p>The play also does not skirt the issue of sex. Kelly and Neil are very obviously attracted to each other. This was essential to Weatherill \u201cbecause disabled people aren\u2019t often seen as sexually attractive or sexy\u201d. Kelly\u2019s mum, played by Penny Layden, struggles to see Kelly as a woman with sexual agency; the need to protect her is too ingrained. Gordy makes it clear that Kelly\u2019s sexuality is an integral part of her character. The play lets her character flirt, kiss and be kissed, and she\u2019s enjoyed the opportunity to perform this.</p> <p>From early on Weatherill was adamant that he wanted a scene in which two characters with learning disabilities are on stage together talking about something other than their disabilities. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what they would say, but that was important.\u201d To this end he created the character of Dominic, played by the actor and comedian Nicky Priest, who is initially set up on a blind date with Kelly but goes on to become her friend. As someone who has Asperger syndrome and is familiar with the stereotypes surrounding the condition, Priest found playing the character rewarding and hopes to contribute to changing those perceptions through his portrayal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"28801b98c521269abc161f5bf40f2e778538cd08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28801b98c521269abc161f5bf40f2e778538cd08/0_0_4353_3162/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Penny Layden as Agnes and Nicky Priest as Dominic in Jellyfish.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"726\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Penny Layden as Agnes and Nicky Priest as Dominic in Jellyfish.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gordy is excited about the prospect of playing the National Theatre. \u201cIt\u2019s like a dream come true,\u201d she says. It won\u2019t be the first play there in which a character with learning difficulties features prominently \u2013 this was also true of 2013\u2019s Up Down Boy \u2013 but it\u2019s not a long list. \u201cThere should be more people with Down\u2019s syndrome on screen and everywhere in the industry,\u201d says Gordy. Priest also believes that if a play features neurodiverse characters, every effort should be made to cast neurodiverse performers, as not only will it provide more opportunities for them but \u201cthe portrayal of those neurodiverse characters will be as authentic and accurate as possible. It\u2019s not rocket science.\u201d</p> <p>Weatherill says that when he started sending his play out, one theatre wondered if it wouldn\u2019t be easier if an actor without a learning difficulty played the lead. This was only five years ago, but the conversation around disability and representation has moved on since then. You wonder if that question would be asked now.</p> <p>Ultimately, says Gordy, it\u2019s not really a play about Down\u2019s syndrome. It\u2019s one woman\u2019s story, agrees Weatherill. It\u2019s not intended to represent a community. Recently he was in discussion with some \u201ctelly people\u201d and he floated an idea featuring Gordy to which they responded: \u201cWe\u2019ve already got one Sarah Gordy project.\u201d \u201cNo one says that about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/sheridan-smith\">Sheridan Smith</a>,\u201d he says. \u201cJust because you\u2019ve done something once doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s finished. We\u2019re not done.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Jellyfish is at the <a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/jellyfish\">National Theatre, London</a>, 5-16 July.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Ben Weatherill set out to write a romantic comedy, the first thing he did was ask himself: \u201cWho do we not see fall in love very often?\u201d Disabled people are underrepresented in the genre, characters with learning disabilities even less so. Weatherill consulted Mencap and discovered that 3% of people with a learning disability live as a couple, compared with 70% of the general adult population. He decided to write a play about someone who is neurodiverse and someone who is neurotypical falling in love. Jellyfish was the result. First seen at London\u2019s Bush theatre last year, it is now about to open at the National Theatre. The play is set in Skegness and depicts the relationship between Kelly and Neil. They make each other laugh, they both love chips and they have strong views about The Avengers. She has Down\u2019s syndrome and he doesn\u2019t, not that this bothers either of them. Kelly\u2019s mum, who raised her daughter alone, feels differently. She wants to protect her daughter and worries Neil might be exploiting her. At an early reading of the play, Weatherill met the actor Sarah Gordy, whose screen credits include the BBC\u2019s Strike, Upstairs Downstairs (she played Lady Pamela Holland) and Call the Midwife; she has also performed at Manchester\u2019s Royal Exchange and the New Vic, Newcastle-under-Lyme. Gordy and Weatherill became close and their friendship informed the character of Kelly. \u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot from you,\u201d Weatherill says to her when the three of us meet. He looks at her and grins. \u201cYou tell me to pull my socks up.\u201d \u201cI love how Ben\u2019s brain works,\u201d says Gordy, \u201cand I love being Kelly. She\u2019s strong, witty and funny.\u201d Gordy wanted to act from a young age and used to perform with her sister to entertain the family. \u201cI love to have characters in my head. When I don\u2019t, I feel empty,\u201d she says. She loves Shakespeare. As You Like It is a particular favourite \u2013 she thinks she\u2019d make a good Phoebe. Both Weatherill and Gordy acknowledge that Jellyfish is a \u201ctricky, knotty\u201d play. It offers no easy answers. \u201cIt might make people uncomfortable,\u201d he says. The play doesn\u2019t shy away from the questions of consent, power and agency at its core, questions about who gets to make the decisions about Kelly\u2019s romantic life. The play also does not skirt the issue of sex. Kelly and Neil are very obviously attracted to each other. This was essential to Weatherill \u201cbecause disabled people aren\u2019t often seen as sexually attractive or sexy\u201d. Kelly\u2019s mum, played by Penny Layden, struggles to see Kelly as a woman with sexual agency; the need to protect her is too ingrained. Gordy makes it clear that Kelly\u2019s sexuality is an integral part of her character. The play lets her character flirt, kiss and be kissed, and she\u2019s enjoyed the opportunity to perform this. From early on Weatherill was adamant that he wanted a scene in which two characters with learning disabilities are on stage together talking about something other than their disabilities. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what they would say, but that was important.\u201d To this end he created the character of Dominic, played by the actor and comedian Nicky Priest, who is initially set up on a blind date with Kelly but goes on to become her friend. As someone who has Asperger syndrome and is familiar with the stereotypes surrounding the condition, Priest found playing the character rewarding and hopes to contribute to changing those perceptions through his portrayal. Gordy is excited about the prospect of playing the National Theatre. \u201cIt\u2019s like a dream come true,\u201d she says. It won\u2019t be the first play there in which a character with learning difficulties features prominently \u2013 this was also true of 2013\u2019s Up Down Boy \u2013 but it\u2019s not a long list. \u201cThere should be more people with Down\u2019s syndrome on screen and everywhere in the industry,\u201d says Gordy. Priest also believes that if a play features neurodiverse characters, every effort should be made to cast neurodiverse performers, as not only will it provide more opportunities for them but \u201cthe portrayal of those neurodiverse characters will be as authentic and accurate as possible. It\u2019s not rocket science.\u201d Weatherill says that when he started sending his play out, one theatre wondered if it wouldn\u2019t be easier if an actor without a learning difficulty played the lead. This was only five years ago, but the conversation around disability and representation has moved on since then. You wonder if that question would be asked now. Ultimately, says Gordy, it\u2019s not really a play about Down\u2019s syndrome. It\u2019s one woman\u2019s story, agrees Weatherill. It\u2019s not intended to represent a community. Recently he was in discussion with some \u201ctelly people\u201d and he floated an idea featuring Gordy to which they responded: \u201cWe\u2019ve already got one Sarah Gordy project.\u201d \u201cNo one says that about Sheridan Smith,\u201d he says. \u201cJust because you\u2019ve done something once doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s finished. We\u2019re not done.\u201d \u2022 Jellyfish is at the National Theatre, London, 5-16 July.",

With Boris Johnson likely to become prime minister, and his Brexit strategy making no-deal looking ever more probable, it is one of the key questions of the day. But the answer is not obvious, partly because some Conservative pro-Europeans are not very clear about their intentions on this point. (For example, this morning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/26/boris-johnson-could-ignore-efforts-to-block-no-deal-says-raab\">Rory Stewart was saying he would not vote to bring down a Tory government, </a>but two weeks ago he was saying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jun/13/conservative-leadership-tory-mps-start-voting-for-new-leader-live-news?page=with:block-5d024b4a8f080adae4897642#block-5d024b4a8f080adae4897642\">he would \u201cbring down\u201d Johnson if Johnson tried to prorogue parliament to facilitate no-deal.)</a></p> <p>In an interview on the World at One <strong>Phillip Lee</strong>, the former minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jun/12/justice-minister-phillip-lee-resign-over-brexit-policy\">who resigned last year to back a rebel amendment giving parliament more say over Brexit, </a>explained his thinking on this issue as a leading Tory pro-European. He said he and his colleagues needed to threaten to bring down the government - but that he did not expect it to happen. Here are his main points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Lee said that Tory pro-Europeans like himself had to be as \u201cruthless\u201d as the European Research Group (or ERG, the pro-Brexit Tory caucus) and that that was why they had to keep open the option of voting against the government on a no confidence motion to prevent a no-deal Brexit. </strong>He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Nobody wants to vote no confidence in the government, nobody seeks to do that ... But ultimately if we believe truly that no-deal is unacceptable without the explicit consent of the public, then we have to leave everything on the table ...</p> <p>I\u2019ve watched as the ERG have essentially won through here, and have dictated terms, and they have done this, successfully I might add, by being ruthless and having a clear strategy throughout. And it\u2019s about time those of us who hold the belief that a no-deal on these terms is an unacceptable thing to be contemplating, that we also adopt exactly the same approach that the ERG have successfully undertaken in the last 12 months. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said that there was a \u201ccollective madness\u201d in the Conservative party with people thinking a no-deal Brexit would be acceptable. </strong>He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If somebody says to me \u2018Do I want to vote no confidence in the government\u2019, of course I don\u2019t. I\u2019m a Conservative, have been so for over 27 years.

Over the last year PMQs has become increasingly low-voltage; not irrelevant, because important issues are still being raised and debated, but it now longer feels like the forum where the great political conflicts of the day are being settled. And now that Theresa May is effectively working her notice the problem has intensified. Jeremy Corbyn chose to ask her about arms sales to Saudi Arabia, a cause he cares about passionately, and while it was good to see the topic get an airing (Corbyn did manage to make May squirm reasonably successfully, although she hit back very firmly in her final answer), it still felt like displacement activity, because he was ignoring the great crisis facing the country. The SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford is always much more comfortable raising Brexit and for the second week in a row he used PMQs to engage in Boris Johnson character assassination. But without Johnson there to respond, it was like arm wrestling without an opponent. Still, only four more of these to go, and then come September, when the new PM is due at the despatch box for the first time, it might all liven up again.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d135e8f8f080e828514fd6a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-26T12:03:37.518Z\">1.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In response to a point of order about why he did not ask Ian Blackford to withdraw what he said about Boris Johnson making a career out of lying, <strong>John Bercow, </strong>the Speaker, says he did not hear a specific allegation of dishonesty.

NB: The EU has said repeatedly the withdrawal agreement is not up for renegotiation.</p> <p><strong>Plan B:</strong> If (when?) the EU says no, seek agreement from Brussels for a standstill on tariff rates under article 24 of the World Trade Organisation\u2019s general agreement on tariffs and trade (sigh) while the two sides work towards a free trade agreement.</p> <p><strong>Plan C:</strong> If this fails, no deal on October 31 with full tariffs on Day 1, with only those preparations and parachute arrangements unilaterally planned by the U.K and the EU in place. Throughout, the \u00a339bn divorce payment agreed by May will be withheld till Johnson is satisfied by the EU\u2019s commitments on trade.</p> </blockquote> <p>Given that plan A is almost certainly impossible - even if the EU was willing to negotiate a new withdrawal agreement, which it says it isn\u2019t, almost no one thinks that such a deal could be signed and legislated for in the UK before 31 October - there is increased focus on plan B. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/jun/25/tory-leadership-latest-news-boris-johnson-rudd-tells-boris-johnson-optimism-not-enough-to-deliver-brexit-live-news?page=with:block-5d11e5a78f080e828514efcc#block-5d11e5a78f080e828514efcc\">Yesterday Johnson scaled down his assertions about the potential of article 24,</a> accepting that the UK could not use it unilaterally, but still claiming it was a viable means of keeping EU-UK trade tariff fee in the event of there being no deal.</p> <p>But, overnight, <strong>Liam Fox</strong>, the international trade secretary has pitched in, using an article to effectively accuse Johnson of of peddling \u201csupposition\u201d not fact on this point. Fox is supporting Jeremy Hunt for the Tory leadership. But he is also a hardline Brexiter, whose instinctive Brexit views are much closer to Johnson\u2019s than Hunt.

Gatt</em><em> article XXIV permits the establishment of free trade agreements and customs unions as an exception to the \u2018most favoured nation\u2019 principle at the WTO - namely, that WTO members cannot give preferential treatment to products and services originating from one trading partner over others.</em></p> <p><em>However, in order to benefit from the terms of article XXIV, there must be an agreement between two WTO members as to the elimination of duties and other restrictive regulations on substantially all trade. Therefore, article XXIV would not, by itself, allow the UK to maintain tariff-free trade with the EU in the absence of a negotiated agreement ...</em></p> <p><em>A \u2018no deal\u2019 scenario, by definition, suggests that there would be no mutual agreement between the UK and the EU on any temporary or permanent arrangement.

This from tortoise\u2019s Chris Cook and the Observer\u2019s Michael Savage: And this from the ex-director of legislative affairs at No 10, Nikki da Costa: That\u2019s it from me. Goodnight and thanks for tuning in. And this from Kevin Schofield from PoliticsHome on the matter: This from MP Luciana Berger, who left the Labour party earlier this year because she felt it had become an \u201cinstitutionally anti-Semitic\u201d party: This from Sky\u2019s Tom Rayner, in reaction to Berger\u2019s tweet above: This just in from my colleague Patrick Wintour on the Chris Williamson case. Read the whole thread he has retweeted. My colleague Rowena Mason has written up a summary of the Tory hustings: Perhaps unsurprisingly, Chris Williamson\u2019s readmission to the Labour party is generating more comments on Twitter than the Tory hustings. Here my colleague Jessica Elgot\u2019s story: This from Ian Austin MP, formerly Labour and now independent: And this from Labour\u2019s Jess Phillips MP: This from Labour MP Stella Creasy: This from The Times\u2019 Henry Zeffman: And this from Sky News\u2019 Tom Rayner: This from The Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn: My colleagues Rowena Mason and Heather Stewart have written a piece about a planned Tory MP attempt to throw a spanner in the works of no-deal proceedings. This is from the BBC\u2019s Glenn Campbell: An interesting piece of info from the Observer\u2019s Michael Savage: This from the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar: Conservative MP Mark Francois, the deputy chairman of the European Reserach Group, has told Robert Peston that Boris Johnson has promised the ERG not to bring the withdrawal agreement back for another vote. This from the Spectator\u2019s Andrew Neill on Hunt\u2019s and Johnson\u2019s comments regarding the rules of Gatt24 in case of a no-deal exit: Jeremy Hunt just posted this video on Twitter: And this is from the official BackBoris campaign: Jeremy Hunt just told Peston on ITV that he \u201cpresumes from what Boris is saying\u201d that Johnson would call a general election in case parliament takes no-deal off the table. I thought I\u2019d heard Johnson say the opposite, but who knows with all this mumbling. This from Buzzfeed\u2019s Emily Ashton: I seem to have missed that Boris Johnson said he would not include Nigel Farage in the Brexit negotiations. This from SkyNews: I\u2019ll now be gathering some reactions to the Tory hustings. This from my colleague Owen Gibson: The hustings have wrapped up now. Asked what the biggest threat is post-Brexit, Johnson says Britain faces real problems in regard to Iran, the Middle East in general, and Russia. He mentions the Skripal poisonings, and how he was tasked, as foreign secretary, to convince other countries that Russia had been behind the attacks, and to expel diplomats, which he says was managed successfully. What will he do about knife crime? He says when he was mayor of London, a \u201cmassive programme of stop and search\u201d took about 11,000 knives off the streets of the capital, says this halved the murder rate. Adds that mothers of murdered kids want this to happen. Is he concerned about creeping NHS privatisation? Johnson says under his premiership everyone would remain entitled to free health care, particularly under a free trade deal with the US. How would he rebalance the north-south divide as PM? Johnson says transport is \u201cthe great unsung liberator\u201d of the small man, gives HS2 as an example, says some towns in the north are \u201cless happy\u201d, and that \u201cthere are ways\u201d to stimulate them, via infrastructure, broadband, education, and devolution. And that\u2019s it from him, his time is up. Q: What would his housing policy be? Johnson says he would \u201cencourage better, more housing, but not on greenbelt sites\u201d. He draws again on his mayor of London experience and takes a dig at Sadiq Khan: \u201cWe are not building enough at the moment.\u201d He says better infrastructure and better broadband and education would encourage people to migrate to towns across the country, and bring jobs to areas other than London. As he spells this vision out, Johnson sounds, for the first time in this session, coherent and confident. Asked about utility prices, Johnson says they are too high, and that \u201cthere may be things we can do\u201d. Boris Johnson just misremembered Liam Fox\u2019s name, after which he said, slowly: \u201cLiam Fox, trade secretary\u201d. Johnson now says \u201cit didn\u2019t seem to me\u201d that he had suggested being prepared to circumvent parliament in order to get his Brexit outcome. Adds he does not believe no-deal will happen, and that the odds for this are \u201ca million to one against\u201d. Would he call a general election in case parliament blocks no deal? No, he would not, Johnson says. Would he suspend parliament? Johnson refuses to answer the question, says Tories are facing an \u201cexistential threat\u201d, and that until Brexit is \u201cover the line\u201d there can\u2019t be talk of a general election. Q: How would he get young people to vote for the Tories? Johnson says via appealing to them with policies in the areas of housing, environment, and one \u201ccrucial thing\u201d: the \u201cexcessive burden\u201d of student debt. And the solution \u201cmay lie in the interest rate\u201d, or elsewhere. Q: How will he unite the country and heal Brexit divisons? His answer is erratic, excuse my inability to note down one clear line it contained. Q: What will his stance be on immigration? And how will he avoid his immigration policies being viewed as xenophobic? Johnson says he doesn\u2019t think there has been any other Tory politician as committed to talent as he has been, \u201cbut I do believe it should be controlled.\u201d Says he is in favour of an Australia-style points-based system. Who would be in his cabinet? He wants a more positive approach to Brexit, but wants to \u201cleave it at that\u201d, says he \u201cmade no promises\u201d. Enter Boris Johnson. He opens his statement by saying the Tory party is \u201cin crisis\u201d. These three things, Johnson says, need to happen: 1) \u201cWe need to come out of the EU on 31 October\u201d, with the help of someone who believes in the Brexit project 2) \u201cWe need to unite our party and our country\u201d (and he says he was able to unite Londoners as mayor). 3) Faster broadband for all parts of the country And he\u2019s got a 4th: 4) Get the Tory party ready to fend off Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party at a general election. The final question to Hunt is what he would do to improve children\u2019s mental health. Hunt says he wants to employ an extra 19,000 people to tackle the youth mental health crisis, and that he wants the UK to be the first country to take children\u2019s mental health seriously. And that\u2019s it for him, his time is up. Next question is about how Hunt would reduce knife crime. He says the reduction in police numbers went too far, the Conservatives had to make difficult fiscal decisions post-financial crash, and the reductions in both police spending and social care \u201cwent too far\u201d, and this would have to change. Says despite this scenario, he managed to negotiate an extra \u00a320bn for the NHS as health secretary. Hunt is asked about tariffs in case of no-deal. He says \u201cthere isn\u2019t a no-deal route\u201d in regard to Gatt 24 that wouldn\u2019t require both sides to consent. Asked whether Boris Johnson has been lying in that regard, Hunt gives an evasive answer and says he wouldn\u2019t exactly call it lying. Hunt is asked what his own faults are. Answer: \u201cI certainly have plenty of faults.\u201d But he adds it would \u201cdemean the competition\u201d if he and Boris Johnson only pointed fingers at each other. Q: How will he ensure the north of the country is getting a better deal if he becomes PM? Hunt says he is backing the Northern Powerhouse rail, and that he wants the UK to be \u201cthe world\u2019s next Silicon Valley\u201d. He wants a \u201cnorthern tech-triangle\u201d, like the \u201cLondon-Oxford-Cambridge triangle\u201d in the south. Hunt is asked whether he would simply go from Brexit extension to extension if he became PM. Hunt says he wouldn\u2019t. \u201cI will leave without a deal, [...] but I will do so with a heavy heart.\u201d Q: How confident are you that you can beat both Corbyn and Farage at a next general election? Hunt: \u201cMy absolute commitment is to not provoke a general election before we have left.\u201d Says Conservative Party is the actual party standing up for small people, not Labour, and the party that \u201cwalks the walk\u201d in terms of social justice, to a bit of jeering from the audience. Hunt now says he will give \u201cfull rights\u201d to the 3 million EU nationals in the UK. A question about big infrastructure projects: Would he support HS2 and a third Heathrow runway? Hunt says he would back both as PM. Hunt says US-UK relationship should be treated as \u201csacred\u201d. He is asked about the future of the NHS in case of no-deal and the potential threat of \u201ccreeping privatisation\u201d of the health service. Hunt said president Trump misunderstood British demonstrators campaigning for better NHS funding. Hunt now speaks about the rise of China, which, he says, \u201cis not a democracy\u201d, mentions his wife, and jokes: \u201cGot the nationality right!\u201d Hunt says he\u2019ll be the first ever PM with \u201ca background as an entrepreneur\u201d, and someone prepared to walk away \u201cif we don\u2019t get what what we need\u201d. He says he followed his Navy dad around the country, and repeats his pledge to increase defence spending beyond 2% of GDP, and says he wants to abolish illiteracy. Says he\u2019ll also be \u201cthe first PM for half a century\u201d to win in a marginal seat. Adds: \u201cI won\u2019t fight an election until we\u2019ve left the European Union\u201d. Then refers to the Labour party as a \u201ccrocodile in the water\u201d, and the \u201cmost dangerous, anti-western Labour party we\u2019ve ever had\u201d. And it\u2019s starting: The first ever Tory live online hustings. The host is journalist Hannah Vaughan Jones. She says the candidates have not been privy to any of the questions. She is now introducing Jeremy Hunt. Before the fun begins, here a piece by my colleague Rowena Mason on Boris Johnson\u2019s testosterone-laden campaign. Hello everyone. The live Tory hustings are starting shortly. Both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt will be answering questions from members of the public put to them by the host from 7pm for 60 minutes. The event is streamed live on Facebook and Twitter, and uploaded to YouTube, via the Conservative party channels. On Twitter, people wanting to put questions are asked to use the #AskTheNextPM hashtag. Jeremy Hunt, the underdog in the race for the Tory leadership, has claimed that Boris Johnson cannot be trusted to keep his promise to deliver Brexit by 31 October in all circumstances. (See 2.55pm.) Hunt was speaking a day after Johnson made his \u201cdo or die\u201d commitment to hit the October Brexit deadline a key issue in the contest. Phillip Lee, a pro-European former minister, said his party was gripped by \u201ccollective madness\u201d because Brexiters backing Johnson were arguing a no-deal Brexit - which seems increasingly probable under Johnson\u2019s declared Brexit strategy - would be acceptable. (See 2.27pm.) Later, at 7pm, Johnson and Hunt will both be taking part in a digital hustings. We will be covering that live here. Theresa May has defended Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt after they were labelled the most incompetent foreign and health secretaries in a century. Eurosceptic Conservative MPs have hit back at the trade secretary, Liam Fox, for \u201cludicrously tilting at windmills\u201d, after he rejected Boris Johnson\u2019s claim that exporters would be spared tariffs if Britain left the EU without a deal. Boris Johnson has appointed Lynton Crosby\u2019s business partner Mark Fullbrook to sharpen up his Conservative leadership campaign. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s spokesman has insisted the Labour leader makes his own decisions, as he hit back against claims by Margaret Beckett that some of Corbyn\u2019s close aides wanted Britain to leave the EU, \u201cno matter what\u201d. Mark Carney has indicated that the Bank of England could have to cut interest rates should Britain crash out of the EU without a deal as he said the mounting risks of such a scenario were slowing down growth. The Liberal Democrat leadership candidate Ed Davey has suggested his party could back Yvette Cooper or Hilary Benn as head of a government of national unity, to be installed instead of a general election if the government lost a no-confidence vote. MP Chris Williamson has been readmitted to the Labour party after he was suspended for suggesting the party had been \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d about antisemitism. Ian Austin, who sits as an independent MP after leaving Labour because he did not think it was taking antisemitism seriously, said this decision was a disgrace. Theresa May is to hold talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin when the two leaders attend the G20 summit in Osaka, Downing Street has said. Thousands of people have gathered around Westminster to call on their MPs to take urgent action on the climate and environmental \u201cemergency\u201d. An estimated 12,000 people attended, according to organisers. Shaun Spiers, chair of Greener UK, one of the groups behind the mass lobby, said: The broad range of people and organisations supporting the lobby shows the feeling across the country that urgent action is needed, starting with an ambitious environment bill and policies that put us on track for net zero emissions by 2045. The time to act is now. Michael Russell, the Scottish government\u2019s constitutional relations secretary, has given MSPs details of its plans for a citizens\u2019 assembly to consider Scotland\u2019s future and Brexit. He told them: We have to keep innovating in order to keep moving. When we see, in the Brexit issue, a complete breakdown in trust between politicians and people, surely it should inspire all of us, no matter our political allegiance, to find new ways to bring politicians and people together to resolve deep seated division. Citizens\u2019 assemblies are becoming an established way for mature democracies to engage with complex and contested issues on an inclusive, informed and respectful basis. That is what we want for Scotland. The Scottish government has also set up a website for the assembly. Rory Stewart has said it would be \u201cheartbreaking\u201d to leave his job as international development secretary were Boris Johnson to become the next prime minister. The Scottish government is to boost the incomes of the country\u2019s poorest families by offering them \u00a310 a week for every child in addition to child benefit payments. The government\u2019s failure to get to grips with the escalating financial crisis in social care has put tens of thousands of older and disabled people at risk of being denied basic support such as help with washing and dressing, care chiefs have warned. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. But my colleague Jedidajah Otte will be picking the blog up again before 7pm to cover the Tory hustings. Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, has said she is backing Jeremy Hunt fo Tory leader. Her endorsement hasn\u2019t always been a guarantee of success. In earlier stages of the contest she backed first Sajid Javid, and then Michael Gove, but they were both eliminated. In her speech on housing in Manchester this afternoon Theresa May said that the government would be publishing an action plan for reforms to social housing in September. It was partly inspired by the evidence given by Grenfell Tower residents, she said. She went on: It will include the creation of a stronger consumer regulation regime for social housing, enhancing tenants\u2019 rights and making it easier to enforce them. Changes to the way complaints are resolved, so that tenants know exactly how to raise concerns and can be confident their voices will be heard and acted on. Empowering residents still further by requiring landlords to demonstrate how they have engaged with their tenants. And a commitment to further boost the supply of high-quality social housing through the affordable homes programme and other funding. A hundred years after the introduction of Britain\u2019s first council houses, I want to see not just homes that people have to live in but homes they want to live in, homes they can be proud to live in. But May\u2019s speech was mostly about reflecting on her record, not looking to the future. She said that she had identified housing as a key issue when she took office and, among the achievements she listed, she said the government: Was on course to deliver 1m new homes by 2020, as promised in the 2015 Conservative manifesto. Had created a Ministry of Housing. Had set up a \u00a35.5bn housing infrastructure fund to allow developers to build on sites that were previously not viable. Seen the number of first-time buyers reach the highest level for more than a decade. Abolished the housing revenue account (HRA) cap, allowing councils to build council houses. Announced plans to repeal section 21 of the Housing Act, ending so-called \u201cno fault\u201d evictions. Set up the Building Better, Building Beautiful Commission. The Corbynite MP Chris Williamson has been readmitted to Labour, PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield reports. Williamson was suspended in February after saying Labour had been \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d about allegations of antisemitism in the party. Labour readmitted Williamson after a national executive committee panel considered his case and issued him with a formal warning. A party source said: An NEC panel, advised by an independent barrister, found Chris Williamson had breached the party\u2019s rules and gave him a formal sanction. He could face further, more severe, action if he repeats any similar comments or behaviour. Tonight the Conservatives are holding a digital hustings. People are invited to submit questions on Twitter or via Facebook, and a moderator, the journalist Hannah Vaughan Jones, will be reading them out for Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt to answer in person. There will be no studio audience, but there people will be able to watch a live feed. Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, has said the UK should leave the EU by 31 October. As Sky\u2019s Kate McCann report, Foster made the comments, which support Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit stance, not Jeremy Hunt\u2019s, at an event at lunchtime. And on a campaign visit earlier, Jeremy Hunt accused Boris Johnson of making a promise, to deliver Brexit by 31 October, that he was unlikely to keep. He said: You should only, if you want to be prime minister, make promises you can actually deliver and my concern about that fixed date is that we know parliament will try and stop a no-deal Brexit and then you could end up tripping into a general election, that puts Corbyn in Downing Street and there\u2019ll be no Brexit at all. I\u2019m the person who\u2019s far, far more likely to deliver Brexit by October 31 because I can negotiate a deal with the European Union and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. Yesterday Boris Johnson revealed his secret model bus-making habit. Today, in an interview with Radio 2\u2019s Jeremy Vine, Jeremy Hunt, Johnson\u2019s rival for the Tory leadership, spoke about his passion for the lambada. He told the programme: When I was elected as an MP in 2005 my big passion was lambada dancing, I have a lot of Brazilian friends, I used to go to the carnival in Brazil. This just brings back some happy memories. This is a dance for single people and quite an intimate dance so perhaps not one for the married listeners. Earlier this government the Welsh government switched its position on Brexit and committed itself to firmly arguing for a referendum and for the UK to remain in the EU. Originally it had argued for a soft Brexit, to honour the referendum result. But it switched to backing remain because it concluded that a soft Brexit was not an option. The Scottish government is also arguing for remain. But what makes the Welsh government decision potentially significant is that the Welsh government is run by Labour, meaning that its new position increases the pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to commit the party to backing remain in a future referendum. Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, has written an open letter to all Welsh MPs urging them to back a second referendum. He says his government is backing remain because, with the Tory leadership election, the UK is now \u201calmost certainly facing a straight choice between a no-deal and remain in the EU\u201d. Crashing out of the UK at Halloween could result in a \u201cflurry of profit warnings\u201d from publicly listed companies in November, MPs have been warned. As my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll reports, the Institute for Chartered Accountants for England and Wales (ICAEW) told MPs that this could have a \u201csystemic\u201d impact on the confidence in the British economy. Are there enough Tory MPs willing to vote down their own government in a no confidence debate to stop a no-deal Brexit? With Boris Johnson likely to become prime minister, and his Brexit strategy making no-deal looking ever more probable, it is one of the key questions of the day. But the answer is not obvious, partly because some Conservative pro-Europeans are not very clear about their intentions on this point. (For example, this morning Rory Stewart was saying he would not vote to bring down a Tory government, but two weeks ago he was saying he would \u201cbring down\u201d Johnson if Johnson tried to prorogue parliament to facilitate no-deal.) In an interview on the World at One Phillip Lee, the former minister who resigned last year to back a rebel amendment giving parliament more say over Brexit, explained his thinking on this issue as a leading Tory pro-European. He said he and his colleagues needed to threaten to bring down the government - but that he did not expect it to happen. Here are his main points. Lee said that Tory pro-Europeans like himself had to be as \u201cruthless\u201d as the European Research Group (or ERG, the pro-Brexit Tory caucus) and that that was why they had to keep open the option of voting against the government on a no confidence motion to prevent a no-deal Brexit. He said: Nobody wants to vote no confidence in the government, nobody seeks to do that ... But ultimately if we believe truly that no-deal is unacceptable without the explicit consent of the public, then we have to leave everything on the table ... I\u2019ve watched as the ERG have essentially won through here, and have dictated terms, and they have done this, successfully I might add, by being ruthless and having a clear strategy throughout. And it\u2019s about time those of us who hold the belief that a no-deal on these terms is an unacceptable thing to be contemplating, that we also adopt exactly the same approach that the ERG have successfully undertaken in the last 12 months. He said that there was a \u201ccollective madness\u201d in the Conservative party with people thinking a no-deal Brexit would be acceptable. He said: If somebody says to me \u2018Do I want to vote no confidence in the government\u2019, of course I don\u2019t. I\u2019m a Conservative, have been so for over 27 years. But I look on at this and I think there is a collective madness out there at the moment, in thinking that no-deal, and delivering it in this way, is acceptable, politically deliverable, and in the interests, socially and economically and geopolitically of my country - I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t see that. He said he did not accept the idea that a no confidence vote would automatically lead to Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister. Another alternative might be some sort of government of national unity, headed by a backbencher, he said. But he said he was not aware of any conversations about a possible government of national unity taking place. He also said that there were other parliamentary options, besides a vote of no confidence, that could be used to stop a new prime minister going for no-deal. He said that, because of the parliamentary opposition, he was \u201cconfident\u201d the next Conservative leader would conclude that a no-deal Brexit was \u201cjust not deliverable\u201d. Instead the new leader would conclude the only options were a referendum, a general election or revoking article 50, Lee said. Here are some tweets from the post-PMQs Labour party briefing. This is what Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, said about Boris Johnson at PMQs. On the one hand the Tories are asking people to put their faith in the most incompetent foreign secretary in a century, a man who has made a career out of lying, who has spent this week avoiding the media, staging photos and playing to the extreme delusions of the Tory shires. Blackford also criticised Jeremy Hunt, calling him \u201cthe most incompetent health secretary in our history\u201d, but it was what he said about Johnson that infuriated Tory MPs because Commons rules normally stop MPs accusing each other directly of lying. Frankly, does anyone care? Over the last year PMQs has become increasingly low-voltage; not irrelevant, because important issues are still being raised and debated, but it now longer feels like the forum where the great political conflicts of the day are being settled. And now that Theresa May is effectively working her notice the problem has intensified. Jeremy Corbyn chose to ask her about arms sales to Saudi Arabia, a cause he cares about passionately, and while it was good to see the topic get an airing (Corbyn did manage to make May squirm reasonably successfully, although she hit back very firmly in her final answer), it still felt like displacement activity, because he was ignoring the great crisis facing the country. The SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford is always much more comfortable raising Brexit and for the second week in a row he used PMQs to engage in Boris Johnson character assassination. But without Johnson there to respond, it was like arm wrestling without an opponent. Still, only four more of these to go, and then come September, when the new PM is due at the despatch box for the first time, it might all liven up again. In response to a point of order about why he did not ask Ian Blackford to withdraw what he said about Boris Johnson making a career out of lying, John Bercow, the Speaker, says he did not hear a specific allegation of dishonesty. (See 12.25pm.) He says what he did hear was distasteful, but he did not judge it disorderly. Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader at Westminster, says Britons who were victims of IRA violence have not received compensation from the Libyan government, which provided the IRA with weapons, but Americans have. May says she has discussed this issue with the Libyan authorities. Gillian Keegan, a Conservative, asks about cancer care in West Sussex. May says cancer care is addressed in the NHS\u2019s long-term plan. She accepts that it is hard for patients if they are asked to travel long distances for treatment. The SNP\u2019s Marion Fellows says figures out today show that \u00a3973m is owed in unpaid child maintenance. The Child Maintenance Service does not use all the powers available to it to get parents to pay up, she says. Will May review this? May says this is a difficult area. For many years governments have been trying to get this right. The simplified system in place now is better than what was there before, but she will ask the relevant department to look at this. Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Conservative, asks about Nice, and the drug Spinraza, which is used to treat spinal muscular atrophy. He says Nice said this drug would be available in a statement on its website, and then had to clarify, meaning his constituent could not access it. May says this should not have happened. Unusually, John Bercow, the Speaker, intervenes to say if Rees-Mogg wants a debate on this before the summer recess, that debate will take place. Labour\u2019s Emma Dent Coad asks May to use her final days in office to respond to Grenfell Tower issues, including setting up a social housing regulator with teeth. May says the government has already taken many measures in response to the Grenfell tragedy. Sir John Hayes, a Conservative, asks May to use the tax system to steer resources away from big monoliths to small, local businesses. May says the government has already introduced reforms to business rates. Labour\u2019s Stephen Pound says May could be distracted by her imminent departure. But will she spare a thought for the 1m-plus PHMOs -pensioner households missing out (on benefits). May says the government wants people entitled to benefits to get them. Labour\u2019s Kerry McCarthy asks about the case of a 14-year-old girl with autism placed in a secure unit 150 miles away from home. May says the government has been looking at this issue very carefully. It wants more funding to be available for more facilities. Andrew Mitchell, the Conservative former international development secretary, asks May if she accepts the UK should move to much more neutral position on Yemen. May says the government is working for peace in Yemen. Labour\u2019s Jo Stevens asks about a constituent who was abducted and taken to Libya. She asks if May will take up this case, and May says she will ensure that happens. Labour\u2019s Karen Lee asks if May accepts her actions have made a no-deal Brexit more likely. May says she voted three times for a deal. Labour did not, she says. Alistair Burt, the former Middle East minister, asks May if she agrees that Corbyn\u2019s comments about Yemen were one-sided. Both sides have committed atrocities, he says. May does agree. Labour\u2019s Khalid Mahmood asks about the recent poll showing that almost half of Conservative party members would not want to see a Muslim prime minister. Will May order an inquiry into what is increasingly a nasty party? May says the Conservative party takes Islamphobia very seriously. People have been thrown out of the party. She says this contrasts with Labour\u2019s approach to antisemitism. It is easier to get thrown out of Labour for voting Lib Dem than for antisemitism, she says. Paul Masterton, a Conservative, asks about the Wimbledon tournament. May offers her wishes to the players taking part. Suella Braverman, the Conservative MP, says she will soon give birth. She says she is glad proxy voting has been introduced. She asks May to back a campaign for safer roads. May wishes Braverman the best for her birth. And she commends the campaign. Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, says the Scottish government was the first in the UK to declare a climate emergency. Quoting Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201cdo or die\u201d comment, he asks May to condemn the idea of a no-deal Brexit. May says as PM she voted three times for a Brexit deal. Blackford says it is no wonder May is leaving, that was no answer. The Tories are asking the country to put their faith in the worst foreign secretary in the last 100 years, \u201ca man who has made his career out of lying\u201d. Blackford condemns Boris Johnson as \u201ca man who has made a career out of lying\u201d. Blackford also criticises Jeremy Hunt, but it is hard to hear because so many Tories are shouting \u201cwithdraw\u201d. He says neither candidate is fit to be PM. May says either candidate would be better than the MPs sitting on Blackford\u2019s bench. Corbyn says the government stop the sale of arms to Saudi Arabia. He asks if May accepts the UN assessment that the crown prince was involved in the murder of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. May says she has raised this case with the Saudi authorities. She wants the investigation to proceed. Corbyn says more than 200,000 people have been killed from the war in Yemen. The court of appeal judgment should be a wake-up call, he says. He says the government should accept it. May says bringing peace to the Yemen is exactly what the government is working on with its diplomatic partners. She says the relationship with Saudi Arabia has saved lives in the UK. But let\u2019s look at Corbyn\u2019s sympathies. After the Salisbury poisoning attack, Corbyn sympathised with Russia. When the IRA were killing Britons, he sympathised with them. And in the recent crisis in the Gulf, he sided with Iran. He is not fit to be prime minister, she says. Corbyn says the PM does not understand the depth of feeling on this matter. It is estimated that more than 200,000 people are being killed in this conflict, many of them children. If the Saudi government say they are respecting human rights, do we ignore all evidence to the contrary? May says while the government is appealing against the court case, it will not be approving new export licences for arms to Saudi Arabia. She says the government is concerned about the humanitarian situation in Yemen. It has allocated more than \u00a3700m for aid. Corbyn says UN experts have been saying for years the Saudi coalition has been violating international law in Yemen. The government says there can only be a political solution. So why is it putting more arms into the region. May says the the only resolution will come from a diplomatic solution. That is why the government is working for one. Jeremy Corbyn says climate change campaigners are lobbying MPs today. This parliament was the first in the world to declare a climate emergency he says (after backing a Labour motion). He says he welcomes the court of appeal judgment last Thursday about arms sales to Saudia Arabia. Does the PM dispute the court\u2019s finding? May says the UK has one of the most robust arms sales regimes in the world. She says the government is disappointed the court found against the government on one ground, and it will be seeking permission to appeal. Corbyn says Germany and Denmark have both banned armed sales to Saudi Arabia. Does May think there are serious, ongoing violations of international law by Saudia Arabia in Yemen. May says the government considers these issues very carefully when considering arms sales. But there needs to be a peace settlement in Yemen. She says the Saudia Arabian intervention came in response to the legitimate government of Yemen. May says discussions are continuing about a different approach to localism in Yorkshire. Labour\u2019s Thangam Debbonaire asks if May thinks the new PM should pass an environment and climate change bill to make the world a more beautiful place. May says the government already has introduced an environment bill. But why is Labour in the Lords trying to block the net zero carbon emissions target. Theresa May starts by wishing the England football team good luck against Norway this morning. And she says she hosted a reception this morning for armed forces reserves day, and Saturday is armed forces day, she says. Later today she will travel to Japan for the G20 summit, where global challenges like climate change and the threat to peace in the Gulf will be discussed. From the Press and Journal\u2019s Dan O\u2019Donoghue Theresa May has only five more PMQs left. Today\u2019s is starting very soon. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. And here is Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leadership contest, mocking the favourite in the Tory contest ... Boris Johnson is inviting people to give him a call on Monday night. Doubtless there will be plenty of journalists trying to get through ... The BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley has been tweeting from a hustings for Westminster\u2019s other leadership contest - the Lib Dem one, feature Jo Swinson and Sir Ed Davey. The population of the UK has risen to 66.4m but the growth rate has stalled, the Press Association reports. The latest calculations reveal there was an estimated 66,436,000 people living in the country at the end of June last year, according to data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). But the growth rate remained the same as the previous year. Over the 12 months to the middle of 2018, the UK population rose year-on-year by 0.6%, with the annual growth rate remaining slower than any year since mid-2004. Here is Alberto Nardelli, BuzzFeed\u2019s Europe editor, on Steve Baker\u2019s article 24 tweet. (See 10.40am.) At the Commons Treasury committee Labour\u2019s Wes Streeting asked Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, to respond to what Boris Johnson said about him in his LBC interview yesterday. Johnson appeared to criticise Carney\u2019s understanding of the article 24 process - before admitting Carney might not have said what he implied he did. Carney started by pointing out that Johnson clarified his initial comment yesterday saying Carney was wrong. Then he went on: I did not say that there needed to be the withdrawal agreement for Gatt 24 to apply. I said there needed to be an agreement ... When I was asked about it, it was \u2018Could you unilaterally use Gatt 24?\u2019 And the answer was no, you can\u2019t unilaterally use Gatt 24. There has to an agreement ... some form of agreement between the two parties that you are working towards a free trade or customs union agreement, something along that spectrum, and that has to be credible enough to the other members of the WTO [World Trade Organisation] that that is indeed the case ... Just to be clear, it gets into questions of semantics and precise language. But if one is asked can you have no-deal and Gatt 24 - well, an agreement is a form of deal, an agreement to use Gatt 24, at least in my understanding of the English language ... So there needs to be some form of agreement, and intention, and a credible intention to move towards a free trade or customs union. This is from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand, who has been watching the Mark Carney hearing. I will post the full quote shortly. The Tory MP Marcus Fysh, a Brexiter who is backing Boris Johnson for the leadership, has posted a Twitter thread about the Gatt article 24 debate. It starts here. As mentioned earlier, what is at issue is not so much what article 24 says, which is verifiable, but whether the EU would be willing to use it, which is a matter for political judgment. This is what Fysh says on this issue. Steve Baker, the Tory Brexiter and deputy chairman of the European Research Group, which represents Conservative MPs pushing for a harder Brexit, has accused Liam Fox of \u201ctilting at windmills\u201d in his overnight LinkedIn article (see 9.23am) - ie, misrepresenting Brexiter arguments about the potential of Gatt article 24. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has just started giving evidence to the Commons Treasury committee. My colleague Graeme Wearden is covering it here. As the Independent reports, Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, said in a speech last night that a Boris Johnson\u2019s premiership could be an \u201copportunity for disaster\u201d. He said: Boris has placed at the very centre of his campaign the commitment that we will leave the EU on 31 October, deal or no deal. This a complete hostage to fortune. At the same parliament has been clear, rightly in my view, that it will not countenance leaving the EU without a deal. It is always a good maxim in politics not to enter a room unless you know that you can get out of it. Boris Johnson has not only entered the room but he has put on the straitjacket, padlocked the door and started the tap running. Kerslake said Johnson was \u201cgood to work with\u201d when they worked on housing issues together when Johnson was mayor of London. But he recalled Johnson cracking a joke about how \u201cOut of every disaster comes an opportunity - or in my case an opportunity for another disaster.\u201d Kerslake went on: \u201cBoris as PM may just be another opportunity for disaster.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn wants to back a second EU referendum but some of his inner circle seem to want Brexit to be carried out no matter what, Labour\u2019s Margaret Beckett has said. As my colleague Rowena Mason and Jessica Elgot report, Beckett, a former foreign secretary who is campaigning for a second referendum, told the Today programme she thought the Labour leader was open to the idea but some of his closest advisers were preventing him from budging and would be prepared to allow a no-deal Brexit. Beckett said: I don\u2019t get the impression that Jeremy himself is the stumbling block. There are people very close with great influence on him who are passionately opposed to it \u2026 and he wants to keep the party together as much as possible. Unfortunately, it\u2019s looking more and more that some of the people who he wants to accept the majority view are not just expressing reservations but completely oppose, and I\u2019m beginning to think some of them do actually want Britain to leave no matter what and they don\u2019t give a toss. Here is Rowena and Jessica\u2019s full story. Yesterday the German ambassador to UK, Peter Wittig, said his government would \u201ctalk to the last hour\u201d to avoid a no-deal Brexit. He has also written a 1,500 word article in Handelsblatt which will be seen as a plea to the UK not to crash out of the EU on 31 October. In the piece he: Warns that a free trade agreement after a no-deal Brexit would be \u201cenormously difficult\u201d. Advocates a deal with \u201cmore than a conventional\u201d third country special relationship between Britain and EU. Talks of the need for a continuing close military relationship. Says all countries must ask what their global status will be in 10, 15 years. Wittig says: Negotiating a free trade agreement after a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit would be enormously difficult. The UK\u2019s obligations under the withdrawal agreement would remain unresolved, trust would be destroyed. We would not be able to return to the agenda immediately ... Short-term considerations must not prevail. We have to preserve the strategic view of Europe in the world: where will Europe stand in 10, 15, 20 years? Where do we want Europe to stand? Will the EU still play a role on the global map in a world dominated by the US and China: politically, economically, technologically, militarily? If we Europeans want to continue to sit at the table of the global powers of design in the future, we must join forces - also and especially in the case of Brexit. It is in the pan-European interest to keep Britain as the fifth largest economy in the world and - with France - Europe\u2019s leading military power with veto power in the Security Council in joint orbit. This requires a high level of vision from all. The United Kingdom legally becomes a so-called \u201cthird country\u201d as of the date of withdrawal. But we need more than a conventional third state relationship. We need a partnership of our own kind that is as close as possible, hence a new \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the EU and the UK. Sir Bill Cash, the Tory Brexiter, has been tweeting this letter published in the Daily Telegraph implying that Gatt article 24 could be used quite easily to allow tariff-free trade to continue after a no-deal Brexit. In fact, if you read the letter closely, you will see that what it is saying about how Gatt article 24 works is much the same as what Liam Fox is saying in his LinkedIn article. (See 9.23am.) The difference between the two sides lies in their assessment of the EU\u2019s willingness to use this mechanism. Fox is arguing that, in the event of the UK and the EU failing to negotiate a withdrawal agreement, there is no prospect of the EU saying that, actually, they have agreed in principle to conclude a free trade deal in the future. But Cash seems to think this would be an option. In his article Fox also says that article 24 would not be a panacea anyway because it only covers tariffs. It does not cover \u201cmore complex behind the border regulatory issues affecting trade\u201d, he says. Boris Johnson would be able to ignore parliament\u2019s efforts to stop a no-deal Brexit and blame the EU if it refuses to give the UK a better deal, Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary, has said. As my colleagues Rowena Mason and Matthew Weaver report, Raab, who is now backing Johnson for the Tory leadership, told the Today programme that any motion from MPs against a no-deal Brexit would have \u201czero legal effect\u201d and could be overridden. But Rory Stewart, the international development secretary who is now backing Jeremy Hunt for the leadership, told the same programme that parliament had not exhausted all options to prevent no deal. He said: Parliament is against no deal. It is only the legal default because parliament made it the legal default. Parliament can unmake it the legal default. There are many, many opportunities in legislation that have to brought forward, that could be amended in order to stop a no-deal Brexit. Here is our full write-up of the Raab and Stewart interviews. At one stage in his TalkRadio interview yesterday Boris Johnson described his Brexit strategy as a set of three preferences, with plan A as his preference, plan B as his fallback, and plan C as the fallback to the fallback. Charlie Cooper sums them up well in the Politico Europe London Playbook briefing this morning. Plan A: A deal with the EU replacing the Northern Ireland backstop aspect of May\u2019s withdrawal agreement with \u201calternative arrangements\u201d that will be brought up to speed during a standstill transition period much like the one agreed by May. NB: The EU has said repeatedly the withdrawal agreement is not up for renegotiation. Plan B: If (when?) the EU says no, seek agreement from Brussels for a standstill on tariff rates under article 24 of the World Trade Organisation\u2019s general agreement on tariffs and trade (sigh) while the two sides work towards a free trade agreement. Plan C: If this fails, no deal on October 31 with full tariffs on Day 1, with only those preparations and parachute arrangements unilaterally planned by the U.K and the EU in place. Throughout, the \u00a339bn divorce payment agreed by May will be withheld till Johnson is satisfied by the EU\u2019s commitments on trade. Given that plan A is almost certainly impossible - even if the EU was willing to negotiate a new withdrawal agreement, which it says it isn\u2019t, almost no one thinks that such a deal could be signed and legislated for in the UK before 31 October - there is increased focus on plan B. Yesterday Johnson scaled down his assertions about the potential of article 24, accepting that the UK could not use it unilaterally, but still claiming it was a viable means of keeping EU-UK trade tariff fee in the event of there being no deal. But, overnight, Liam Fox, the international trade secretary has pitched in, using an article to effectively accuse Johnson of of peddling \u201csupposition\u201d not fact on this point. Fox is supporting Jeremy Hunt for the Tory leadership. But he is also a hardline Brexiter, whose instinctive Brexit views are much closer to Johnson\u2019s than Hunt. And, given his cabinet job, he is also the one minister who ought to know what he is talking about on the matter of Gatt. Here is LinkedIn article. And here is an extract: Some commentators have suggested that, in a \u2018no deal\u2019 scenario, the UK could maintain its existing trading relationship with the European Union for up to ten years by claiming exemption from the WTO\u2019s rules, under article XXIV:5 of the general agreement on tariffs and trade (Gatt). This is not the case. Gatt article XXIV permits the establishment of free trade agreements and customs unions as an exception to the \u2018most favoured nation\u2019 principle at the WTO - namely, that WTO members cannot give preferential treatment to products and services originating from one trading partner over others. However, in order to benefit from the terms of article XXIV, there must be an agreement between two WTO members as to the elimination of duties and other restrictive regulations on substantially all trade. Therefore, article XXIV would not, by itself, allow the UK to maintain tariff-free trade with the EU in the absence of a negotiated agreement ... A \u2018no deal\u2019 scenario, by definition, suggests that there would be no mutual agreement between the UK and the EU on any temporary or permanent arrangement. In those circumstances article XXIV cannot be used. The European Union has made it clear on a number of occasions that full tariffs will be applied to the United Kingdom in the event of \u2018no-deal\u2019. The director-general of the WTO, Roberto Azevedo, has also confirmed there must be a bilateral agreement between the EU and the UK in order to claim an implementation period under Gatt article XXIV. \u201cOnce they have an agreement I think article XXIV could give them some time for implementation of that agreement,\u201d he told Bloomberg. \u201cBut the first question is the agreement itself\u201d ... It is important that public debate on this topic is conducted on the basis of fact rather than supposition, so that we are able to make decisions in the best interests of our country. We will doubtless hear much more on this today, including from Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, who is giving evidence to MPs. At one point yesterday Johnson said that Carney was wrong about Gatt - before he retracted and accepted (correctly) that Carney might not have said what Johnson thought he had said. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, gives a speech to the Telegraph\u2019s future of trade and export forum. 10am: Damian Hinds, the education secretary, gives evidence to the Commons education committee. 10am: Jo Swinson and Sir Ed Davey take part in a Lib Dem leadership hustings in the Commons. 10.15am: Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, gives evidence to the Commons Treasury committee. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. 12pm: Arlene Foster, the DUP leader, speaks at a Policy Exchange event on the backstop. Afternoon: Theresa May gives a speech on housing in Manchester. 3pm: Rory Stewart, the international development secretary, gives evidence to the Commons international development committee. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing mostly on the Tory leadership contest. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "It is known as Goldilocks weather \u2013 not too hot and not too cold. For those of us who dislike extreme heat, Ireland may be the best place to go on holiday this summer. Temperatures rarely hit the peaks we experience in south-east England and certainly don\u2019t reach the unpleasantly hot extremes becoming increasingly frequent in resorts around the Mediterranean. Indeed, if you like your climate to be as equable as possible then head to Valentia Island, County Kerry, one of the most westerly points in Ireland. According to figures from the island\u2019s weather station, the mean temperatures between January and July fluctuate by just 8C. Occasionally, conditions do get much warmer or cooler: the record high is almost 30C, while the lowest temperature ever recorded is minus 8C. The only downside to spending a summer holiday in Valentia is the rainfall. It is the wettest of all Ireland\u2019s weather stations, with a total of more than 1,500mm (more than 60ins) of precipitation each year. Sunshine, too, is on the low side: between four and five hours a day during the summer months. But with such beautiful scenery and spectacular views across the Atlantic, this corner of the Emerald Isle can still give the Med a run for its money.",

      "bodyText": "An investigator from the unit examining alleged illegal land-clearing by a company part-owned by Angus Taylor was at a meeting between Taylor, Josh Frydenberg\u2019s office and senior environment department officials \u2013 but Taylor denies the meeting had anything to do with the case. Guardian Australia revealed last week that Taylor met with Frydenberg\u2019s office and department officials to discuss the federal government\u2019s designation of critically endangered grasslands. The meetings occurred at the same time that New South Wales and federal investigations were underway into the poisoning of 30 hectares that contained the grasses on a property in the state\u2019s Monaro region owned by Jam Land Pty Ltd. One of the directors of that company is Richard Taylor, the minister\u2019s brother, and the minister himself holds an interest in the firm via his family investment company, Gufee. After lobbying by Taylor, Frydenberg\u2019s office canvassed whether protections for the grasslands \u2013 known as the natural temperate grassland of the south-eastern highlands \u2013 could be watered down and if it could be kept secret. Taylor has said the briefing he received from the department was unrelated to the investigation. Emails obtained by Guardian Australia under freedom of information showed Frydenberg\u2019s office specifically requested the department\u2019s assistant secretary of compliance, Monica Collins, attend. The office of compliance investigates potential breaches of national environment laws and the department said last week Collins did not go to the meeting on 20 March 2017. But the department has now confirmed another compliance officer attended in her place. Labor and the Greens say it raises fresh questions about why the meeting was sought by Frydenberg\u2019s office, on Taylor\u2019s behalf, while Frydenberg was the environment minister and Taylor was the minister for cities. In response to questions, Taylor said: \u201cI made no requests as to who participated in this briefing. \u201cAs the department has already confirmed, the briefing did not include discussion of compliance action.\u201d The environment and energy department confirmed the compliance officer was present, along with Geoff Richardson, the assistant secretary of the department\u2019s protected species and communities branch, as well as a member of Richardson\u2019s staff. A spokesperson said the investigator attended the meeting \u201cas an observer\u201d. \u201cThe purpose of the meeting was to outline the technical aspects of the grasslands listing, which had been raised as the No 1 issue of concern to farmers in the Monaro region,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cDepartment officials were aware of the compliance matter and did not discuss the matter with Minister Taylor.\u201d But Labor\u2019s environment spokeswoman, Terri Butler, said there was a growing list of questions for both ministers. \u201cThe long list of unanswered questions for the treasurer and minister Taylor about this rapidly escalating ministerial ethics scandal is growing,\u201d Butler said. \u201cWho knew what and when? The government needs to come clean with the Australian people about this outrageous and deeply troubling set of allegations, which is eating away at public trust in the government.\u201d The Greens\u2019 deputy leader, Larissa Waters, said the party would demand an explanation when parliament resumes next week. \u201cA federal anti-corruption body is long overdue and the Greens will push to ensure such a body has broad powers to investigate scandals like this one,\u201d Waters said. The grasslands have been protected under Australia\u2019s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act since 2000. Their status was upgraded from endangered to critically endangered by the former environment minister Greg Hunt in 2016. Taylor, who has repeatedly denied making any representations regarding the compliance action, said he was briefed in his capacity as the member for Hume \u201cgiven the significant impact of these changes on farmers in my electorate\u201d. The critically endangered grasslands are mainly found on the Monaro plains, which are not in Hume. However, some communities of the grassland are found in Taylor\u2019s electorate. Guardian Australia did not receive responses to a list of questions put to Frydenberg. His office referred back to the treasurer\u2019s statements from last week: \u201cThe listing of natural temperate grassland of the south-eastern highlands was revised up from endangered to critically endangered on 6 April 2016,\u201d Frydenberg said. \u201cIn early 2017, the member for Hume subsequently sought a meeting to understand the impact on his constituents of the revised listing.

      "bodyText": "As the Women\u2019s World Cup enters the quarter-final stages, the sound heard across the globe is of records \u2013 and prejudices \u2013 being joyously shattered. At the weekend a peak audience of 6.9 million watched England\u2019s match against Cameroon, and there is every expectation that figure will be surpassed on Thursday night when Phil Neville\u2019s side face Norway. With France, Brazil and Italy also enjoying record-breaking TV figures in recent days there is growing sense that women\u2019s football, which has often been marginalised and sneered at, has finally gone mainstream. The BBC has told the Guardian that three of England\u2019s matches at the Women\u2019s World Cup rank in its top 10 most-watched football games of 2019 \u2013 something that would have been unthinkable barely a decade ago - with only Manchester United\u2019s FA Cup ties against Chelsea and Arsenal, and the final between Manchester City and Watford, attracting higher peak audiences. Even Glastonbury has got in on the act, responding to a plea from England\u2019s 20-year-old midfielder Georgia Stanway to show the Norway game so that her brother can watch it while at the festival. No wonder that when a Norwegian reporter asked Karen Bardsley whether England was in the midst of a \u201crevolution in women\u2019s football\u201d, the goalkeeper nodded in agreement. \u201cThat\u2019s a nice way to put it,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cWe have gone from struggling to get teams in competitions to having massive clubs involved and being full-time professionals.\u201d Neville also admits he was caught by surprise by the sudden surge in popularity. \u201cWhen I took the manager\u2019s job 18 months ago I never envisaged we\u2019d be where we are today,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s exploded, really. The World Cup has helped. But you don\u2019t have an explosion without the quality on the field.\u201d That big bang is being felt globally, too. According to Fifa, France\u2019s match against Brazil at the weekend got the biggest TV audience for a Women\u2019s World Cup match with 35 million watching in Brazil and another 10.6 million in France. There was a similarly uplifting story in the Netherlands, where the victory against Japan on Tuesday was watched by 3.54 million \u2013 the fourth-highest TV rating for any sporting event in the country during 2019. Italy\u2019s manager, Milena Bertolini, has noted the effect that the team\u2019s progress into the quarter-finals has had on attitudes back home. \u201cI know cultural changes take a lot of time, but this team are able to break down some of those prejudices,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s their mission.\u201d Lynsey Douglas, the women\u2019s sport global lead at Nielsen, which tracks TV audiences, told the Guardian that the boom in viewers in the UK and elsewhere are indicative of a wider trend. \u201cThe audiences for this Women\u2019s World Cup have been breaking records all around the world, with plenty of free to air coverage attracting audiences in the millions,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd while there are still eight games remaining, we fully expect this to be the most watched women\u2019s tournament in history.\u201d England go into their quarter-final as warm favourites, given they are ranked third in the world while Norway are outside the top 10. Neville, although his team have not yet completely convinced, is confident they will handle the greater expectations back home. \u201cIn the past, you\u2019d probably shield the players from a fear of failure \u2013 but my girls don\u2019t have that,\u201d he said. \u201cThree or four years ago we were crying out to get to these levels of attention and visibility. When we get here we\u2019re not going to back off and say it\u2019s a bit nerve-wracking.\u201d Bardsley, who has been part of the national side since 2005, is convinced that this is by far the strongest England team she has played for. \u201cWe\u2019re in a fantastic place,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had more belief. We are the most prepared team, the most resilient team. We know our strengths inside and out. And we have gained and gathered momentum. I\u2019m very excited because we haven\u2019t met our full potential yet.\u201d",

But at the same time you also want your brother to win and you have to beat him.\u201d Who Judy would support? \u201cHa!\u201d Murray says. \u201cGood question. You can ask her that. There\u2019s no chance she\u2019d watch. No chance.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In the midst of a refereeing and VAR storm Pierluigi Collina was calm. A media briefing on refereeing mid-tournament is not a new occurrence. At <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/29/pierluigi-collina-holding-crackdown-var-hailed-success\" title=\"\">the 2018 World Cup a similar conference was called</a>. Except then it was easier. It was about success. The much-maligned VAR was, overall, working.</p> <p>This time the attention is on the game\u2019s rules and the implementation of those rules in a way few would have expected before a ball was kicked at the Women\u2019s World Cup. But Collina, the chairman of Fifa\u2019s refereeing committee, was on a mission. In a Marcelo Bielsa-esque session at the Parc des Princes, Collina talked through controversial rule by controversial rule with the aids of PowerPoint and video. Leaping up to test a member of the press on whether a photo on his phone showed a ball on the line \u2013 \u201cNo,\u201d the bemused reporter replied \u2013 Collina swept across to bring a different angle into view and had his \u201cta\u2011da\u201d magician moment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/26/england-steph-houghton-a-major-doubt-for-world-cup-quarter-final-with-norway-football\">England\u2019s Phil Neville keeps cool amid World Cup fitness and heat fears</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Later, he interrupted a question, keen to show frame-by-frame an incident in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/24/sweden-canada-womens-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">Sweden\u2019s defeat of Canada</a> to show exactly why there was a lengthy stoppage and whether prioritising accuracy over time was correct.</p> <p>Responding to the most common complaint, that the Women\u2019s World Cup is being used as a guinea pig to test these new rules, he said these rules have already been used in the Under-20 World Cup in Poland and are being used in the current Africa Cup of Nations and Copa Am\u00e9rica. Last December all 24 nations competing at this World Cup were invited to a meeting on the rules, while teams were able to test and begin playing under the rules to practise during the two international windows of 2019. \u201cOn none of these occasions did we receive any complaints or questions,\u201d Collina said. \u201cThey were accepted.\u201d</p> <p>The decision to suspend the booking of goalkeepers that breached the new rule of keeping a single foot, rather than both, on the line, was taken following experiences of the new system at the under-20s in Poland, Collina said. \u201cWe realised in Poland that all the incidents were not deliberate. It was because of a lack of control of the body. An honest encroachment. We thought it was harsh \u2026 It\u2019s a temporary dispensation so will be discussed further.\u201d</p> <p>The response to the new one-foot rule surprised Collina. Because it was designed to help shot-stoppers. \u201cKeeping two feet on the line is impossible\u201d, he said.</p> <p>\u201cIf the law that existed is not effective, or enforced by the referee, we have to change it. First we thought we have to change it to make the goalkeepers\u2019 job easier. So we decided to allow them to step one foot off. This is the only change we made.\u201d</p> <p>Yet rather than the rule itself being the problem, it is the stringent implementation of it, to the millimetre, that is drawing ire. Not just for goalkeepers on the line but for offsides, too.

      "bodyText": "In the midst of a refereeing and VAR storm Pierluigi Collina was calm. A media briefing on refereeing mid-tournament is not a new occurrence. At the 2018 World Cup a similar conference was called. Except then it was easier. It was about success. The much-maligned VAR was, overall, working. This time the attention is on the game\u2019s rules and the implementation of those rules in a way few would have expected before a ball was kicked at the Women\u2019s World Cup. But Collina, the chairman of Fifa\u2019s refereeing committee, was on a mission. In a Marcelo Bielsa-esque session at the Parc des Princes, Collina talked through controversial rule by controversial rule with the aids of PowerPoint and video. Leaping up to test a member of the press on whether a photo on his phone showed a ball on the line \u2013 \u201cNo,\u201d the bemused reporter replied \u2013 Collina swept across to bring a different angle into view and had his \u201cta\u2011da\u201d magician moment. Later, he interrupted a question, keen to show frame-by-frame an incident in Sweden\u2019s defeat of Canada to show exactly why there was a lengthy stoppage and whether prioritising accuracy over time was correct. Responding to the most common complaint, that the Women\u2019s World Cup is being used as a guinea pig to test these new rules, he said these rules have already been used in the Under-20 World Cup in Poland and are being used in the current Africa Cup of Nations and Copa Am\u00e9rica. Last December all 24 nations competing at this World Cup were invited to a meeting on the rules, while teams were able to test and begin playing under the rules to practise during the two international windows of 2019. \u201cOn none of these occasions did we receive any complaints or questions,\u201d Collina said. \u201cThey were accepted.\u201d The decision to suspend the booking of goalkeepers that breached the new rule of keeping a single foot, rather than both, on the line, was taken following experiences of the new system at the under-20s in Poland, Collina said. \u201cWe realised in Poland that all the incidents were not deliberate. It was because of a lack of control of the body. An honest encroachment. We thought it was harsh \u2026 It\u2019s a temporary dispensation so will be discussed further.\u201d The response to the new one-foot rule surprised Collina. Because it was designed to help shot-stoppers. \u201cKeeping two feet on the line is impossible\u201d, he said. \u201cIf the law that existed is not effective, or enforced by the referee, we have to change it. First we thought we have to change it to make the goalkeepers\u2019 job easier. So we decided to allow them to step one foot off. This is the only change we made.\u201d Yet rather than the rule itself being the problem, it is the stringent implementation of it, to the millimetre, that is drawing ire. Not just for goalkeepers on the line but for offsides, too. VAR leaves no room for manoeuvre or subjectivity and Collina, the head of Fifa\u2019s refereeing department, Massimo Busacca, and Fifa\u2019s senior manager of refereeing, Kari Seitz, are convincing in their sympathetic picking apart of whether it needs to be so hair-splitting. \u201cToday, in matches with VAR, if the technology makes us able to view something we cannot ignore it,\u201d Collina said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it is 2cm or 20cm, there isn\u2019t a small offside and a big offside. If a ball is over the line by 0.5cm its a goal. There are not small goals or big goals. It\u2019s not a matter of small encroachment or big encroachment, it\u2019s just encroachment.\u201d He was dismissive of Cameroon\u2019s complaints over perceived England offside incidents during their hotly contested game in Valenciennes on this score: \u201cThey all have the right to complain as long as the complaints are based on facts. If they are not based on facts I have no time for them.\u201d However, \u201cnot all decisions are black or white,\u201d the former referee said. \u201cThere is room for interpretation. I know there is this mood. And we ask ourselves what could have been done differently and it is hard to find the answer, especially when the referee took the correct decision, or when VAR made the correct decision. If my common sense damages someone else, I cannot use common sense.\u201d The Scotland goalkeeper Lee Alexander stepped off her line to save Florencia Bonsegundo\u2019s penalty in the 93rd minute against Argentina forcing a retake. The resulting goal sent Scotland out of the tournament. Collina believes the state of the match meant the decision was more controversial, rather than being incorrect, and that had the incident taken place in different circumstances people would have given it less attention. On handball incidents, though, he was more evasive, brushing over the decisions in the same \u201ccorrect\u201d or \u201cincorrect\u201d manner, ignoring the bigger questioning of the rule itself: that the arm must be in a \u201cnatural\u201d position. When reviewing the late penalty that handed the Netherlands a quarter-final spot against Japan he ran through the VAR process but did not take up the question of whether, given Saki Kumagai\u2019s contorted straining body, her arm placement is \u201cnatural\u201d in the context of her movement and whether, to be frank, having limbs is being penalised.",

      "bodyText": "Labour MPs have expressed fury at Chris Williamson\u2019s re-admission to the party after having been suspended for suggesting the party had been \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d about antisemitism. Labour\u2019s Ruth Smeeth called the decision \u201cdisgusting\u201d and said colleagues did not want Williamson in the party. \u201cI am horrified,\u201d she said on Wednesday. \u201cIt says a great deal about how seriously we\u2019re taking anti-Jewish hate.\u201d She added that she was \u201cnot comfortable being in the same room\u201d as the Derby North MP. The Guardian understands party investigators recommended the Derby North MP face a sterner sanction, but were overruled by a panel from the party\u2019s national executive committee, made up of the MPs Keith Vaz and George Howarth and constituency rep Huda Elmi. Sources close to the NEC said Vaz and Elmi had argued for Williamson\u2019s re-admission, with a formal warning, on the basis a snap general election was highly likely. Williamson is now likely to face a deselection battle in his constituency, but will be eligible to stand again for the party in any election. A Labour source said that a party panel, advised by an independent barrister, had found Williamson breached party rules and issued a formal sanction, though chose not to refer him to Labour\u2019s highest disciplinary body, the national constitutional committee, which considers possible expulsions. \u201cHe could face further, more severe, action if he repeats any similar comments or behaviour,\u201d a party source said. Labour MPs including Stella Creasy, Jess Phillips and Wes Streeting, all expressed disgust at the decision. Phillips said she was \u201cdisgusted but not surprised anymore\u201d and suggested she would have been expelled had she said similar things to Williamson. Creasy said it was \u201cthe best example yet of why we need an independent process for antisemitism and sexual harassment complaints. The Jewish Labour Movement also criticised the decision and said it showed the \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d the party was currently in. Chair Mike Katz said: \u201cHow dare the Labour party deny it is institutionally racist against Jews when it decides to take no action against Chris Williamson? \u201cIt seems the decision to let him off is because he represents a marginal seat and there might be a snap election. It\u2019s good to know that a party of anti-racists, led by an avowed anti-racist decides it\u2019s OK to ignore anti-Jewish racism if there\u2019s a vote to be won.\u201d A NEC source said it was a \u201cred herring\u201d to blame the decision on the party leadership. \u201cParty staff recommended that he be referred to the NCC, Keith Vaz who is a longtime operator on the Labour right opposed it,\u201d the source said. \u201cThe silver lining is that while suspended from the party Chris Williamson couldn\u2019t face a trigger ballot. Now he can be and I strongly hope he is deselected.\u201d In footage first revealed by the Yorkshire Post, Williamson was cheered by activists in Sheffield as he said: \u201cI\u2019ve got to say, I think our party\u2019s response has been partly responsible \u2026 Because, in my opinion, we\u2019ve backed off far too much, we\u2019ve given too much ground, we\u2019ve been too apologetic.\u201d The MP, who is a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn, later issued an apology saying: \u201cI deeply regret, and apologise for, my recent choice of words when speaking about how the Labour party has responded to the ongoing fight against antisemitism inside of our party. I was trying to stress how much the party has done to tackle antisemitism.\u201d A party spokesman said: \u201cThe Labour party takes all complaints extremely seriously, which are investigated in line with our rules and procedures. We can\u2019t comment on individual cases.\u201d Williamson is likely to face a selection battle in his own constituency after a bitter row with the trade union Unite after he backed plans to reduce trade union influence in MP selections. He has vowed to fight any attempt to remove him as a candidate but said he welcomed open selection.",

      "bodyText": "Glastonbury festival-goers were preparing for a weekend of soaring temperatures as gates opened, with the 49th edition of the event set to be dry, plastic free and potentially very, very hot. There was also room for bizarre political satire as the viral anti-Brexit artists Cold War Steve and Led By Donkeys had collaborated on a billboard overlooking the entire festival site above the Park stage. A Boris Johnson tweet from July 2017, reading \u201cThere\u2019s no plan for no deal, because we\u2019re going to get a great deal\u201d, was placed next to Cold War Steve\u2019s surreal photoshopped images of politicians, pop-culture figures and the EastEnders actor Steve McFadden. Pockets of mud were the only remnants of a few miserable weeks of June weather, with temperatures reaching 20C on Wednesday and highs of 30C and above expected over the weekend. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of mud, a lack of personal hygiene and bad toilets,\u201d said Ilona, who had travelled from the Dutch city of Dordrecht with her children, Lucy and Charlie. She said coming to the festival was on her bucket list and she was glad the forecast meant mud was highly unlikely. \u201cWe were a bit worried about the weather,\u201d said Lucy. \u201cBut it\u2019s really hot in Holland now and it\u2019s a lot better here.\u201d \u201cWe were hoping it wouldn\u2019t be that hot. It\u2019s perfect really,\u201d said Ilona. \u201cAs long as it\u2019s not going to rain and the famous mud stays away we\u2019ll be happy.\u201d JR, a rapper from Wapping, east London, who was attending Glastonbury for the first time, was shocked at the size of the site. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d he said. \u201cI got here on Monday and I\u2019ve seen it all slowly coming to life. I met some people on the gate who were here in 1981 and said back then it was \u00a312 to get in and there would be two hippies on the gate with a bit of rope that they\u2019d lift up to let you in. The scale of it now is incredible.\u201d When tickets went on sale this year, 200,000 were bought in 36 minutes. The event wasn\u2019t held in 2018 to allow the Worthy farm site to recover and two million people pre-registered to have the chance of buying a ticket at a cost of \u00a3248 for a standard package. This year Glastonbury is pioneering a plastic-free system, which means no single-use plastic can be bought on site. The aim isto save on clean-up costs, with the removal of rubbish from the siteestimated at costing \u00a3785,000 and lasting six weeks. The last time the festival was held in 2017, visitors used 1.3m plastic bottles. \u201cA vast amount of plastic bottles were gotten through and when you see images of the arena completely covered in old plastic bottles it\u2019s quite haunting,\u201d said Emily Eavis, the festival\u2019s co-organiser. \u201cWe are tackling drinking bottles at the moment, water bottles \u2026 and we are encouraging people to bring their own reusable bottle but there will also be reusable bottles available on site.\u201d The festival has already banned food traders from using plastic cutlery and plates, insisting instead on compostable alternatives. Only paper straws are available on site, festival wristbands are made of cloth, and single-use plastic cups are not used in the bars. Imi,17, an A-level student from Bridport in Dorset, who has been coming to the festival with her parents since she was six-years-old, was less optimistic about the forecast. \u201cBring wellies or boots, always,\u201d she said. \u201cWhatever the weather looks like, this is Glastonbury.\u201d After a dreary early British summer there were concerns prior to the festival that the weather could dampen spirits. But the forecast is for sun, a few showers and balmy heat \u2013 with potential highs of 31C on Friday. Craig Snell, a Met Office forecaster, said that the festival is likely to be 90% rain free with some showers predicted by Sunday. \u201cYou might still need your wellies because of the rain that\u2019s fallen earlier in the week but mostly it\u2019s looking dry and sunny \u2013 especially on Friday,\u201d he said. Jonny Edmonton, a local from Glastonbury who has been to the festival 12 times, said he was expecting a wet edition. \u201cI work locally and last week it didn\u2019t stop raining. I feared the worst when I checked the forecast but it\u2019s lovely now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very mundane here for the rest of the year, this is what I\u2019ve been waiting for.\u201d",

Jared Kushner arrived in Bahrain touting bedrock principles at untenable discounts. And even then there were no buyers.</p> <p>The conference that was supposed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/25/the-guardian-view-on-trump-and-israel-palestine-the-reality-behind-kushners-fantasy\">offer a new way out of the malaise of the Israel/Palestine</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/25/the-guardian-view-on-trump-and-israel-palestine-the-reality-behind-kushners-fantasy\"> conflict</a> provided little of the sort. Its central premise of prosperity as a precursor to a lasting solution barely appeared to register on either side of the separation wall.</p> <p>In Ramallah and Gaza, there was very little interest in the Trump administration\u2019s proposals. Even in Israel, local media played down the gathering and did nothing to ramp up expectations.</p> <p>The $50bn (\u00a339bn) pledged, effectively as a start-up fund for the region\u2019s Palestinians, was less than enthusiastically received in Jordan, Egypt and in Lebanon \u2013 where leaders in Beirut, not usually inclined to turn away from a $6bn money pot, dismissed the pitch as a shameless bribe.</p> <p>Economic incentives to integrate Palestinian communities around the region and revitalise the West Bank and Gaza economy were widely viewed as redundant in the glaring absence of a political dimension that could turn such pledges in to realities.</p> <p>No-one wanted to talk politics in Manama. In the place of a formula that had underwritten peace initiatives for decades came the expectation that the Trump Administration should be trusted to deliver a just and equitable peace, if and when a political dimension comes around.</p> <p>To say such a demand was a tough sell would be one of the year\u2019s great understatements. The current US administration has been overwhelmingly supportive of the Israeli agenda and openly dismissive of the Palestinians \u2013 a fact that led to a boycott of the workshop by Palestinian leaders.</p> <p>Kushner arrived in Manama as the self-styled envoy who could shake things up, and finally bring traction to a peace process that had gone nowhere in the past decade and had shown real signs of disintegrating.</p> <p>Casting himself as a disruptor who would find new ways to revitalise a moribund issues, he did indeed make bold moves \u2013 all of them in support of Israeli interests to which he is ideologically aligned. Kushner\u2019s one hint of his political stance came when he said the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/mar/28/israel7\">Arab </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/mar/28/israel7\">peace </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/mar/28/israel7\">initiative</a>, brokered 17 years ago by former monarch King Abdullah, was no longer viable.</p> <p>That concession brought into question the internationally agreed formula of a two-state solution. While dismissing the Arab initiative as a vehicle for a two-state solution does not mean the latter is dead, critics in Ramallah and across the region were quick to draw that inference.</p> <p>\u201cFrankly, we demand an independent Palestinian state on the territories occupied by Israel in 1967,\u201d said Ashraf Jabari, chair of the Palestinian Business Network. Hanan Ashrawi, a senior member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, said of Kushner\u2019s plan: \u201cIt is totally divorced from reality. The elephant in the room is the occupation itself.\u201d</p> <p>Abandoning such a foundational platform would take the conflict into unchartered waters, and be sure to raise the ire of much of the global community. It would also beg the question of what could possibly come next that either side could accept as a viable model.</p> <p>The Palestinian position ahead of the conference was as weak as it has ever been; the US had withdrawn humanitarian aid funding, shuttered its missions in the West Bank and Gaza, and kicked out its diplomats from Washington. Its economy has stagnated, political structures broken down and the rule of law across the territories continues to be tested.</p> <p>In short, the Palestinians are in no state to negotiate, even if they were minded to. With Kushner having revealed his hand in Manama, there is now at least more clarity about what to expect for the remainder of this administration.</p> <p>Now comes the guessing game of just how far the US will go if it gets no buy in to its plan. An Iran-style economic strangulation, a push for regime change or more of the same steadily tightening occupation, with no one in Washington raising a fuss about human rights or deteriorating living conditions.</p> <p>As the conference wound down, Tony Blair, who bought into the notion of economic growth being a reboot for the Palestinian economy during his time as head of the Quartet a decade ago, stressed to Kushner the need to abide by the principles of two states and for economic and political initiatives to give heft to any plans. He failed to draw a commitment, and the conference ended with a pledge that whatever comes next will be \u201cfair and just\u201d for both sides.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely foolish to believe you can have economics without sound politics, but it\u2019s likewise completely futile to think politics will work without economics buttressing it,\u201d Blair told the gathering.</p> <p>There was little reason to take such a claim on face value before the Bahrain summit, and even less so now.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the end, the \u2018deal of the century\u2019 was little more than a failed clearance sale. Jared Kushner arrived in Bahrain touting bedrock principles at untenable discounts. And even then there were no buyers. The conference that was supposed to offer a new way out of the malaise of the Israel/Palestine conflict provided little of the sort. Its central premise of prosperity as a precursor to a lasting solution barely appeared to register on either side of the separation wall. In Ramallah and Gaza, there was very little interest in the Trump administration\u2019s proposals. Even in Israel, local media played down the gathering and did nothing to ramp up expectations. The $50bn (\u00a339bn) pledged, effectively as a start-up fund for the region\u2019s Palestinians, was less than enthusiastically received in Jordan, Egypt and in Lebanon \u2013 where leaders in Beirut, not usually inclined to turn away from a $6bn money pot, dismissed the pitch as a shameless bribe. Economic incentives to integrate Palestinian communities around the region and revitalise the West Bank and Gaza economy were widely viewed as redundant in the glaring absence of a political dimension that could turn such pledges in to realities. No-one wanted to talk politics in Manama. In the place of a formula that had underwritten peace initiatives for decades came the expectation that the Trump Administration should be trusted to deliver a just and equitable peace, if and when a political dimension comes around. To say such a demand was a tough sell would be one of the year\u2019s great understatements. The current US administration has been overwhelmingly supportive of the Israeli agenda and openly dismissive of the Palestinians \u2013 a fact that led to a boycott of the workshop by Palestinian leaders. Kushner arrived in Manama as the self-styled envoy who could shake things up, and finally bring traction to a peace process that had gone nowhere in the past decade and had shown real signs of disintegrating. Casting himself as a disruptor who would find new ways to revitalise a moribund issues, he did indeed make bold moves \u2013 all of them in support of Israeli interests to which he is ideologically aligned. Kushner\u2019s one hint of his political stance came when he said the Arab peace initiative, brokered 17 years ago by former monarch King Abdullah, was no longer viable. That concession brought into question the internationally agreed formula of a two-state solution. While dismissing the Arab initiative as a vehicle for a two-state solution does not mean the latter is dead, critics in Ramallah and across the region were quick to draw that inference. \u201cFrankly, we demand an independent Palestinian state on the territories occupied by Israel in 1967,\u201d said Ashraf Jabari, chair of the Palestinian Business Network. Hanan Ashrawi, a senior member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, said of Kushner\u2019s plan: \u201cIt is totally divorced from reality. The elephant in the room is the occupation itself.\u201d Abandoning such a foundational platform would take the conflict into unchartered waters, and be sure to raise the ire of much of the global community. It would also beg the question of what could possibly come next that either side could accept as a viable model. The Palestinian position ahead of the conference was as weak as it has ever been; the US had withdrawn humanitarian aid funding, shuttered its missions in the West Bank and Gaza, and kicked out its diplomats from Washington. Its economy has stagnated, political structures broken down and the rule of law across the territories continues to be tested. In short, the Palestinians are in no state to negotiate, even if they were minded to. With Kushner having revealed his hand in Manama, there is now at least more clarity about what to expect for the remainder of this administration. Now comes the guessing game of just how far the US will go if it gets no buy in to its plan. An Iran-style economic strangulation, a push for regime change or more of the same steadily tightening occupation, with no one in Washington raising a fuss about human rights or deteriorating living conditions. As the conference wound down, Tony Blair, who bought into the notion of economic growth being a reboot for the Palestinian economy during his time as head of the Quartet a decade ago, stressed to Kushner the need to abide by the principles of two states and for economic and political initiatives to give heft to any plans. He failed to draw a commitment, and the conference ended with a pledge that whatever comes next will be \u201cfair and just\u201d for both sides. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely foolish to believe you can have economics without sound politics, but it\u2019s likewise completely futile to think politics will work without economics buttressing it,\u201d Blair told the gathering. There was little reason to take such a claim on face value before the Bahrain summit, and even less so now.",

      "bodyText": "Conservative MPs implacably opposed to a no-deal Brexit will try to amend government legislation as early as next week as a way of binding the hands of Boris Johnson. A cross-party group is planning another attempt to stop a no-deal Brexit after becoming increasingly alarmed at the tone of Johnson\u2019s pledges to take Britain out of the European Union on 31 October, \u201cdo or die\u201d. They are planning with Labour and other opposition parties to pass an amendment that would rule out leaving without a deal \u2013 or at least offer MPs the opportunity of a vote before that happened. Under one plan, they will try to change the parliamentary estimates bill that comes before the House of Commons as early as next Tuesday, with an amendment to prevent a no-deal Brexit put down in the names of Tory MP Dominic Grieve and Labour MP Margaret Beckett. It would stop the government being able to consume resources and spend cash if it pursued a no-deal Brexit policy. Another is the possibility of amending some likely emergency government legislation on Northern Ireland power-sharing, which may appear on Wednesday. The Guardian understands the government is considering introducing an emergency bill next week, to extend the powers civil servants have effectively to govern in Northern Ireland, while the power-sharing assembly continues to be suspended. Parliamentarians who have discussed the plan are concerned about whether an anti no-deal amendment would be ruled outside the scope of the legislation \u2013 but hope they will be aided by the willingness of the Speaker, John Bercow, to bend the rules. However, it is not yet certain to be brought forward. Bercow said in a speech in Washington last month: \u201cThe idea that parliament is going to \u2026 be evacuated from the centre-stage of the debate on Brexit is unimaginable. It is simply unimaginable.\u201d Labour narrowly failed in a recent bid to commandeer the parliamentary timetable for a day, to pave the way for a bid to stop a no-deal Brexit. But a plan led by Conservative backbenchers might have more hope of securing the support of Tory rebels, than one initiated by Jeremy Corbyn and the other opposition leaders. Passing an amendment would also be a less drastic option than voting to bring down the government. Several Conservative MPs, including Ken Clarke and Grieve, have said publicly in recent days that they would consider supporting Labour in a motion of no confidence against the government, if they believed a no-deal Brexit was imminent. Their fears have been raised by increasingly hard Brexit rhetoric from Johnson, who has the backing of key figures in the European Research Group (ERG), which is urging him to deliver Brexit by Halloween, even if that means leaving without a deal. Corbyn has not ruled out tabling a no-confidence vote in the narrow window between the new prime minister being appointed, on Wednesday 24 July, and the House of Commons rising for its summer recess the next day. The Labour leader\u2019s spokesman said on Wednesday they would table such a motion when they believe it has the most chance of success. Supporting Labour in bringing down the government would be a dramatic decision for Conservative MPs, however, who would thereby effectively be resigning from their party. Under the Fixed-Term Parliament Act, if the government loses a formal motion of no confidence, there is then a fortnight-long period in which alternative candidates can try to assemble a governing majority. If they fail to do so, a general election is triggered. Liberal Democrat leadership candidate Ed Davey has suggested a government of national unity could emerge in those 14 days, perhaps led by a Labour backbencher such as Yvette Cooper or Hilary Benn. Philip Lee, a backbench Conservative MP, told the BBC\u2019s World at One that pro-European Conservatives like himself had to be as \u201cruthless\u201d as the ERG as they seek to stop a no-deal Brexit, which was why they had to keep open the option of voting against the government on a no confidence motion to prevent a no-deal Brexit. \u201cNobody wants to vote no confidence in the government, nobody seeks to do that \u2026 but ultimately if we believe truly that no-deal is unacceptable without the explicit consent of the public, then we have to leave everything on the table,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve watched as the ERG have essentially won through here, and have dictated terms, and they have done this, successfully I might add, by being ruthless and having a clear strategy throughout. \u201cAnd it\u2019s about time those of us who hold the belief that a no-deal on these terms is an unacceptable thing to be contemplating that we also adopt exactly the same approach that the ERG have successfully undertaken in the last 12 months.\u201d",

In her victim impact statement, Dixon said \u201cin that moment, my life changed forever.\u201d Dr Edward Hughes, who was retained as an expert witness by the college, suggested that Barwin\u2019s defence \u2013 that improper cleaning of a sperm counter he tested with his own semen must have led to mistaken insemination \u2013 was \u201cimplausible\u201d. \u201cThis is a tragic situation, in which a sea of avoidable harm was done,\u201d wrote Hughes.",

He said: \u201cWe have made major strides towards a better future for all junior doctors.\u201d</p> <p>Under the deal, the 39,000 doctors \u2013 who are all in training \u2013 will get:</p> <ul> <li><p>a payrise averaging 2% for each of the next four years, starting in 2020.</p></li> <li><p>new limits on how much weekend working they do.</p></li> <li><p>new limits on the number of long shifts, of up to 13 hours, they can do in a row.</p></li> </ul> <p>Wijesuriya acknowledged the bitterness of the year-long dispute between junior doctors and the then health secretary Jeremy Hunt in 2015-16, which led to a series of strikes, including an unprecedented total withdrawal of labour, by trainees.</p> <p>The agreement on a new deal had come about \u201cthrough a new collaborative, constructive negotiation process that has learned from the mistakes of the past\u201d, he added.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/24/nhs-consultants-turning-down-work-avoid-huge-pension-tax-bills\">NHS consultants 'turning down work to avoid huge pension tax'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The BMA has been locked in a dispute with the government over the contract since 2016, when Hunt imposed it. Ministers agreed to review in 2018 how it was working. The new deal follows months of detailed negotiations between the BMA and the department of health and social care.</p> <p>Matt Hancock, the health and social care secretary, said: \u201cI\u2019m delighted that we have successfully brought to an end the junior doctors dispute with this landmark agreement. Improved working conditions and an 8.2% four-year pay rise will give junior doctors and current medical students the support they fully deserve.\u201d</p> <p>However, only 11,588 (28%) of the 41,116 junior doctors and final- or penultimate-year medical students who were entitled to vote did so. Of those, 9,449 backed the deal and 2,139 (18%) voted against.</p> <p>The deal is expected to clear its final hurdle on 2 July when the JDC is likely to formally endorse it.</p> <p>But the Doctors\u2019 Association UK, which campaigns to improve junior doctors\u2019 working lives, criticised the new contract. It represents \u201ca poor deal for hardworking junior doctors, with its modest financial gains largely negated by inflation, a drawn-out implementation timetable and contractual loopholes\u201d, it said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "NHS junior doctors have accepted a new contract which gives them an 8.2% pay rise over four years in return for finally ending a four year-long dispute with ministers that triggered the first walkouts they had ever staged. More than four in five (82%) of the junior doctor members of the British Medical Association who voted in a referendum on the new terms and conditions agreed to accept them. About 39,000 junior doctors in England \u2013 all medics below the level of consultant \u2013 will benefit from the deal, which the BMA announced at its annual conference in Belfast. Dr Jeeves Wijesuriya, the chair of the BMA\u2019s junior doctors committee (JDC), said members had approved the deal because they recognised that it involved enhanced shared parental leave and better rest facilities. He said: \u201cWe have made major strides towards a better future for all junior doctors.\u201d Under the deal, the 39,000 doctors \u2013 who are all in training \u2013 will get: a payrise averaging 2% for each of the next four years, starting in 2020. new limits on how much weekend working they do. new limits on the number of long shifts, of up to 13 hours, they can do in a row. Wijesuriya acknowledged the bitterness of the year-long dispute between junior doctors and the then health secretary Jeremy Hunt in 2015-16, which led to a series of strikes, including an unprecedented total withdrawal of labour, by trainees. The agreement on a new deal had come about \u201cthrough a new collaborative, constructive negotiation process that has learned from the mistakes of the past\u201d, he added. The BMA has been locked in a dispute with the government over the contract since 2016, when Hunt imposed it. Ministers agreed to review in 2018 how it was working. The new deal follows months of detailed negotiations between the BMA and the department of health and social care. Matt Hancock, the health and social care secretary, said: \u201cI\u2019m delighted that we have successfully brought to an end the junior doctors dispute with this landmark agreement. Improved working conditions and an 8.2% four-year pay rise will give junior doctors and current medical students the support they fully deserve.\u201d However, only 11,588 (28%) of the 41,116 junior doctors and final- or penultimate-year medical students who were entitled to vote did so. Of those, 9,449 backed the deal and 2,139 (18%) voted against. The deal is expected to clear its final hurdle on 2 July when the JDC is likely to formally endorse it. But the Doctors\u2019 Association UK, which campaigns to improve junior doctors\u2019 working lives, criticised the new contract. It represents \u201ca poor deal for hardworking junior doctors, with its modest financial gains largely negated by inflation, a drawn-out implementation timetable and contractual loopholes\u201d, it said.",

      "bodyText": "The latest engineering construction figures show yet more evidence that Australia\u2019s economy has been struggling for nearly a year now, and that the public sector is failing to fill the gap of falling private sector infrastructure work. What a difference a year makes. This time last year I wrote of the latest engineering construction figures that \u201cinfrastructure spending remains well below peak levels\u201d but \u201cfortunately the level of public infrastructure spending has been rising very strongly\u201d. By the end of the year I was noting that the level of public infrastructure work was slowing and private engineering construction also looked to be going backwards again. And now, with the latest release of the engineering construction figures by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, we see the volume of infrastructure work done for both the private and public sectors has declined for four straight quarters and is now at its lowest level since 2016: The level of engineering work done in the March quarter of this year was 13% below what it was a year ago \u2013 the worst growth since the December 2016 quarter, and is due almost equally to falls in work done in both the private and public sectors: Whereas a year ago public sector infrastructure work was growing at an annual rate of 19% (the strongest since the GFC) now it is falling at a rate of 15%, the biggest fall for five years. The falls occur across the country, but it is very much led by the mining sector. While engineering construction in Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory makes up around 48% of all engineering work done in Australia, it accounted for 84% of the fall in work done over the past year: But we should not merely relax and think this is again just a problem of the end of the mining boom, because all states on the mainland recorded a lower volume of engineering work done in March this year than 12 months ago. Only Tasmania has seen any growth: It is a situation that truly speaks to the calls from the head of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe, for increased infrastructure spending. While there is rightly some questions asked \u2013 such as those by economist Stephen Koukoulas on what precise form that infrastructure should take, it is clear over the past six months there has been a large drop-off in public-sector works. As a percentage of GDP, the engineering work done on roads and bridges over the past six months is as low as it has been for four years and is sharply down on where it was a year ago: While the rolling out of the NBN continues to keep telecommunications engineering work at high levels, it has not been anywhere near enough to make up for the fall in the work done on roads and bridges. When we consider that public investment contributed around a fifth of the growth in the economy over the past year, any drop in public infrastructure work at a time when private sector infrastructure work is also falling does not bode well for growth over the coming year. Currently there appears to be little increase in the amount of work yet to be done for the public sector. In fact the latest figures suggest the lowest level of public sector work still yet to be done for three years: Yes there remains a sizeable pipeline of work in the years ahead, but little sense that we are going to see much of an increase on the level of work that is currently being undertaken. Now clearly the level of public-sector work cannot always grow faster, but should private-sector spending continue to fall then declines in the public sector will only compound the problem. Fortunately there is some good news ahead for the private sector. The value of work yet to be done is rising \u2013 mostly due to mining operations. This generally does feed into actual work, but at this stage looks to be still much lower than in the past: And without infrastructure spending powering any domestic economic growth, we fall back on consumer spending, which has been suffering due to flat real income and wages growth. The figures continue to provide yet more evidence that the economy was suffering well before the election was called and it is why the market is pricing in a nearly 90% chance of a interest rate cut to 1% next week and fully pricing in a cut to 0.75% by November.

The whistleblower has submitted an individual complaint to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC), which is being considered.</p> <p>Peter Timmins, a leading FOI specialist, former diplomat, and lawyer, said the matter warranted a more comprehensive investigation by the OAIC, but expressed doubts about whether that would take place.</p> <p>\u201cThe record isn\u2019t encouraging,\u201d Timmins said. \u201cThe watchdog has undertaken only two own motion investigations into an agency\u2019s actions in performing functions or exercising powers under the FOI Act since the office was established in 2012.

Allan Hawke, the distinguished public servant who led the review, made 40 recommendations to improve the system. The government never responded to the report.</p> <p>Timmins said this had left the current legislation out of date.</p> <p>\u201cOur laws are outdated, implementation, to be kind, is patchy, and the watchdog is under resourced and lacks clout,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe agenda for a government intent on addressing the serious decline in public trust is clear.

He likened the process of getting records from defence as akin to \u201cpulling teeth from a hippopotamus\u201d.</p> <p>Patrick said Labor had only paid lip service to openness and transparency, while doing little to actually push for genuine reform of FOI. He noted Labor had sided with the government to reject his 2018 bill to radically overhaul the FOI system.</p> <p>\u201cCentre Alliance will be using its position in the new Senate to press both the Government and the Opposition to re-engage positively for real FOI reform,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a broken system that must be fixed.\u201d</p> <p>Like Patrick, the Greens have also pledged to fight for FOI reform to address the overuse of exemptions, redactions and delays. The Greens\u2019 democracy spokeswoman, Larissa Waters, said the party would raise the whistleblower\u2019s complaint in Senate estimates.</p> <p>\u201cSunlight is the best disinfectant especially when it comes to politicians\u2019 entitlements, conflicts of interest and internal reviews,\u201d Waters said. \u201cThe Greens will continue to push for transparency in our democracy, and for FOI to be fast, cheap, not riddled with exemptions and not redacted beyond all utility.\u201d</p> <p>Transparency International Australia warned the FOI system was an essential anti-corruption measure. But its chief executive, Serena Lillywhite, said the whistleblower\u2019s complaint suggested the system was failing.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to ask why and shine a spotlight on the blockages,\u201d Lillywhite said.</p> <p>\u201cA well-functioning FOI process can help drive a shift from a culture of secrecy to that of open government, in which everyone has a stake.\u201d</p> <p>The group has previously expressed concern about the growth of FOI rejections and continuing delays in decision-making, and called for greater resourcing for FOI teams in government.</p> <p>\u201cWe have long been concerned that after constant budget cuts to public service agencies they don\u2019t have the resources they need to handle FOI requests in a timely and appropriate way.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Labor has called for the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to investigate allegations that his department repeatedly broke laws to stymy the release of sensitive documents, while crossbenchers announce a renewed push to overhaul Australia\u2019s freedom of information system. Guardian Australia revealed on Wednesday that a freedom of information officer complained of \u201csystemic\u201d unlawful conduct within the department of prime minister and cabinet, which he alleged delayed the release of politically-sensitive documents. FOI and transparency experts, the crossbench senator Rex Patrick, Labor and the Greens have all expressed serious concern about the report. The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said the allegations, if true, were \u201cextremely concerning\u201d. \u201cEver since he became a minister, Mr Morrison has evaded scrutiny. That attitude now infects the whole of his government,\u201d Dreyfus told Guardian Australia. \u201cAs these allegations concern the Prime Minister\u2019s own department, he must investigate the matter. The coalition government has shown contempt for FOI in the past six years \u2013 it\u2019s time for this to change.\u201d The whistleblower\u2019s complaint, made in late 2017, was investigated and treated seriously by the department. The final report found five cases where FOI laws had been breached, due to inexplicable and lengthy delays. The whistleblower has submitted an individual complaint to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC), which is being considered. Peter Timmins, a leading FOI specialist, former diplomat, and lawyer, said the matter warranted a more comprehensive investigation by the OAIC, but expressed doubts about whether that would take place. \u201cThe record isn\u2019t encouraging,\u201d Timmins said. \u201cThe watchdog has undertaken only two own motion investigations into an agency\u2019s actions in performing functions or exercising powers under the FOI Act since the office was established in 2012. The most recent investigative report was published in 2014.\u201d The last significant review of the FOI system in Australia was in 2013. Allan Hawke, the distinguished public servant who led the review, made 40 recommendations to improve the system. The government never responded to the report. Timmins said this had left the current legislation out of date. \u201cOur laws are outdated, implementation, to be kind, is patchy, and the watchdog is under resourced and lacks clout,\u201d he said. \u201cThe agenda for a government intent on addressing the serious decline in public trust is clear. All that is needed is recognition that excessive secrecy and lack of transparency are part of the problem.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Patrick, the Centre Alliance senator, said the whistleblower\u2019s allegations show \u201cjust how utterly broken the system has become\u201d. Patrick is a regular user of FOI and frequently takes cases to the administrative appeals tribunal or information commissioner. \u201cThese disclosures of shameful administrative malpractice and obstruction come as no great surprise for anyone \u2013 journalists, MPs or members of the public \u2013 seeking to use FOI to inform themselves on the workings of government,\u201d he said. \u201cA decade ago Labor senator John Faulkner made a genuine effort to reform the Australian government\u2019s FOI regime, but those efforts now lie in ruins with ministers, departments and agencies largely free to redact, impede, obstruct and deny without penalty.\u201d He said the delay and obstruction alleged against the department was common across the public service, particularly the defence department. He likened the process of getting records from defence as akin to \u201cpulling teeth from a hippopotamus\u201d. Patrick said Labor had only paid lip service to openness and transparency, while doing little to actually push for genuine reform of FOI. He noted Labor had sided with the government to reject his 2018 bill to radically overhaul the FOI system. \u201cCentre Alliance will be using its position in the new Senate to press both the Government and the Opposition to re-engage positively for real FOI reform,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a broken system that must be fixed.\u201d Like Patrick, the Greens have also pledged to fight for FOI reform to address the overuse of exemptions, redactions and delays. The Greens\u2019 democracy spokeswoman, Larissa Waters, said the party would raise the whistleblower\u2019s complaint in Senate estimates. \u201cSunlight is the best disinfectant especially when it comes to politicians\u2019 entitlements, conflicts of interest and internal reviews,\u201d Waters said. \u201cThe Greens will continue to push for transparency in our democracy, and for FOI to be fast, cheap, not riddled with exemptions and not redacted beyond all utility.\u201d Transparency International Australia warned the FOI system was an essential anti-corruption measure. But its chief executive, Serena Lillywhite, said the whistleblower\u2019s complaint suggested the system was failing. \u201cWe have to ask why and shine a spotlight on the blockages,\u201d Lillywhite said. \u201cA well-functioning FOI process can help drive a shift from a culture of secrecy to that of open government, in which everyone has a stake.\u201d The group has previously expressed concern about the growth of FOI rejections and continuing delays in decision-making, and called for greater resourcing for FOI teams in government. \u201cWe have long been concerned that after constant budget cuts to public service agencies they don\u2019t have the resources they need to handle FOI requests in a timely and appropriate way.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The former agriculture minister Barnaby Joyce expanded a taxpayer-funded scheme that gives lucrative concessions to farmers against the advice of Treasury, an audit has found. A report from the National Audit Office on the Farm Management Deposit Scheme shows that an expansion of the scheme, spearheaded by Joyce as minister in 2016, occurred despite none of the proposals having a \u201cstrong case for change\u201d. The auditor general, Grant Hehir, has also found that the FMD scheme, which held more than $6.6bn in deposits in June 2018, does not have \u201cfully effective\u201d administration processes, risk identification, or compliance measures in place. This is despite the amount of foregone revenue from the taxpayer-funded scheme more than doubling from $245m in 2016\u201317 to $500m in 2017\u201318. The report examines three changes to the scheme made by Joyce in 2016, which lifted the limit of deposits from $400,000 to $800,000, allowed early access to deposits and permitted using accounts to offset business loan repayments. The Department of Agriculture\u2019s records indicate the proposal to increase the deposit cap to $800,000 came from the minister for agriculture\u2019s office in April 2015. Prior to this, Treasury was preparing a budget costing for a deposit limit of $500,000. \u201cWhile the advice noted that increasing the deposit limit to $800,000 would assist primary producers to \u2018better manage\u2019 fluctuations in cash flows, it did not include any specific reasons why it was appropriate to double the size of the cap, or provide other deposit limit options for government to consider,\u201d the audit notes. \u201cThe advice noted that a deposit limit of $800,000 would likely benefit a small number of primary producers. No assessment was made as to how the higher limit would support the policy objective of increasing financial self-reliance.\u201d Hehir notes that take-up of the three policy measures have been low, particularly for the loan offset measure, and said \u201csound\u201d advice had been provided to the government that the changes would have a \u201climited\u201d impact on achieving the scheme\u2019s objectives. \u201cTreasury\u2019s advice to government was that none of the proposals provided a strong case for change.

Under the scheme, primary producers are able to defer \u2013 and potentially reduce \u2013 their income tax liability for money held in FMD accounts. The program, established by John Howard in 1999, is designed to allow producers to bank pre-tax income in good years, which they can then draw down in tougher times, such as drought. Surveys suggest that the average amount held in a FMD account is about $274,000 per farm, with an estimated 43% of FMD holdings owned by large farms with a turnover of between $1m and $5m. There are around 45,000 FMD holders participating in the scheme.",

The ancient Randwick flat-line attack coupled with modern rugby league manoeuvres may well be the fusion that helps the Wallabies to cause some surprises at the World Cup.",

      "bodyText": "More than 10 years on from the high court decision on Blue Mud Bay \u2013 which gave Aboriginal traditional owners control over who fishes in their coastal waters, and sparked a bitter battle with fishers and the Northern Territory government \u2013 settlement has finally been reached. In 2008, the high court said that traditional owners of Blue Mud Bay had exclusive access rights to waters which sit on Aboriginal land \u2013 like the intertidal zones of oceans and rivers \u2013 affecting up to 80% of the NT coastline. The decision alarmed amateur and commercial fishers, and tourist operators in the Top End, but represented a chance for traditional owners to reap the economic, cultural and environmental benefits of control over their own waters and fisheries management. Wednesday\u2019s deal, signed at Nitmiluk (Katherine Gorge), is between the first nations people who have rights, interests and responsibilities along more than 6,000 kilometres of coastline, the NT government, the Amateur Fishermen\u2019s Association of the NT, the NT Seafood Council and the NT Guided Fishing Industry Association. The Northern Land Council chief executive, Marion Scrymgour, is \u201cdelighted that this matter is finally being resolved. The settlement arrangements are exciting and offer great opportunities. I believe this package will genuinely assist reconciliation.\u201d Under the agreement, amateur fishers will not need permits for the greater Darwin region, including the area from the Daly River to the East Alligator river, where most recreational fishing occurs. But those arrangements will be reviewed as outstanding land claims are settled in the region. Other areas, such as the Roper River, may be open to long-term access agreements in the future. Codes of conduct will be developed for fishers, and traditional owners will become actively involved in the commercial fishing industry. There will also be a comprehensive review of NT fisheries management, legislation and policy, according to the agreement giving Aboriginal people real input to management of their waters. \u201cSettling Blue Mud Bay has been a complex process,\u201d the Northern Land Council deputy chairman, John Christophersen, said. \u201cFinally we can all move forward together, developing world\u2019s best fisheries management approaches for the NT, and where management is driven by good science rather than politics for the benefit of all Territorians.\u201d The president of the Amateur Fishermen\u2019s Association, Warren de With, said: \u201cToday is the culmination of years of hard work and cooperation.

The latest poll of 1,097 respondents suggests voters remain to be convinced of the merits of stage three of the Morrison government\u2019s income tax package if information is presented to them in terms of budgetary trade-offs. A strong majority, 78%, said maintaining government investments in health and education was more important than legislating a tax cut for workers on incomes of $200,000. Three-quarters of the sample said people earning more than $150,000 should pay a higher rate of tax than workers earning $40,000. Partisan loyalties influenced perceptions of the tax cuts.

Perceptions also varied among different age cohorts. Voters under 34 were more likely to support the tax cuts than retirees. Unsurprisingly, people on higher incomes were more supportive of the concept that people on more modest incomes. While the Morrison government appears likely to be able to pass the tax package in full when parliament returns next week for the first sitting post-election with backing from Senate crossbenchers, political debate has centred around stage three of the $158bn package because Labor has balked at that part. Labor has been divided between MPs who say the opposition should pass the tax cuts given Scott Morrison won the election, and Labor needs to desist from governing from opposition \u2013 and people who believe stage three is fiscally irresponsible, and won\u2019t deliver stimulus to the sluggish economy because high-income earners have a lower propensity to spend any windfall. The result of the internal divisions within Labor is a holding pattern of sorts on stage three. This week\u2019s Guardian Essential survey also took early soundings on the major party leaders for the first time since the federal election on 18 May. The data suggests public support for Morrison has increased in the wake of the Coalition\u2019s victory, with a bounce in both the preferred prime minister measure and in his approval ratings. Morrison is ahead of the new Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, as preferred prime minister 43% to 25%, but the survey also indicated voters are still recalibrating after the recent Labor leadership change, because the number of voters saying they don\u2019t know who their preferred prime minister is has gone up. Morrison\u2019s net approval rating in the survey is 48% and his disapproval is 36%. The Liberal leader\u2019s approval is up five points since the question was last asked in May. But the prime minister\u2019s approval differs along partisan lines. Approval for the prime minister is over three times as strong among Coalition voters as it is among Greens or Labor voters. Labor\u2019s new federal leader has recorded a similar approval rating to his predecessor, Bill Shorten, in this week\u2019s survey (35% net in this poll compared to 38% for Shorten), but his disapproval rating is lower (25% for Albanese and 44% for Shorten). But the data again suggests voters are taking stock after the change of personnel, because there has been a significant increase in the number of voters in the sample saying they don\u2019t know. The lack of clarity manifests across Labor and Coalition voters, and people intending to vote for someone other than the major parties. With media issues continuing to dominate the headlines, voters in the survey were also asked this week to rate their trust in various news products. A majority of people in the sample had at least some trust in SBS TV news (60%) and ABC radio news (57%), while none of the other sources rated above 50%. These results were similar to results recorded last year. There has been controversy post election about the reliability of opinion polling because none of the major surveys \u2013 Newspoll, Ipsos, Galaxy or Essential \u2013 correctly predicted a Coalition win on 18 May8, projecting Labor in front on a two-party preferred vote of 51-49 and 52-48. The lack of precision in the polling has prompted public reflection at Essential, as has been flagged by its executive director, Peter Lewis.

But I\u2019ve been reporting faith and politics in Australia for nearly 40 years and I\u2019ve seen all this before: militant Christians all over the shop, blind to their arrogance and contradictions.</p> <p>Rigid ideologues, they sing great anthems to free speech.

Yes, St Paul was on the case way back at the start but that only makes it vilification with a pedigree.</p> <p>While Folau isn\u2019t calling for men like me to be stoned, whipped or pushed off high buildings, I reckon he is free to preach his horrible<strong> </strong>beliefs. But his freedom shouldn\u2019t trample my freedom or the freedom of anyone else.</p> <p>We are free to say he\u2019s a dork to carry on like this about gays and drunks and idolaters. (That means Catholics, by the way.) And Land Rover is free to stop him promoting their luxury cars. And GoFundMe is free <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/24/israel-folau-donations-page-taken-down-by-gofundme-for-breaching-terms-of-service\">not to be the platform where he raises millions to fight Rugby Australia.</a></p> <p>But to Folau\u2019s Christian backers this notion of freedoms we all share doesn\u2019t make sense.

      "bodyText": "Pity these Christians. They\u2019re lashing out, angry and terrified. Miranda Devine is warning them via the pages of the Sydney Daily Telegraph Australia faces a revolution of \u201ccoercion and bloodshed\u201d \u00e0 la Mexico in the 1920s unless we rally to the cause of Christianity and Israel Folau. The madness is dialled up to the max. But I\u2019ve been reporting faith and politics in Australia for nearly 40 years and I\u2019ve seen all this before: militant Christians all over the shop, blind to their arrogance and contradictions. Rigid ideologues, they sing great anthems to free speech. Warriors of discrimination, they condemn discrimination against Folau. No matter how cruel the doctrines they are pushing they see them washed clean as articles of faith. The fact is, condemning gays to hell is vilification. Yes, St Paul was on the case way back at the start but that only makes it vilification with a pedigree. While Folau isn\u2019t calling for men like me to be stoned, whipped or pushed off high buildings, I reckon he is free to preach his horrible beliefs. But his freedom shouldn\u2019t trample my freedom or the freedom of anyone else. We are free to say he\u2019s a dork to carry on like this about gays and drunks and idolaters. (That means Catholics, by the way.) And Land Rover is free to stop him promoting their luxury cars. And GoFundMe is free not to be the platform where he raises millions to fight Rugby Australia. But to Folau\u2019s Christian backers this notion of freedoms we all share doesn\u2019t make sense. Why? Because for them putting the boot into gays is basic Christianity. This is hard for the rest of us to credit in 21st century Australia, but to make sense of the current uproar it needs to be faced. These Christians \u2013 by no means all Christians \u2013 are willing to burn up huge amounts of political capital to keep and, if possible extend, their power to punish homosexuals. It\u2019s a weird pivot of their faith. This is not all they want the Morrison government to shore up with legislation, but it\u2019s at the core of their demands. They are shy of saying it in so many words, of course, hence all the malarkey we\u2019ve been hearing from them for the last couple of years about freedom. Here\u2019s a simple principle: being decent and kind requires no legislation. You only need a religious freedom act to shelter behind when you plan to be nasty \u2013 say to age-old targets of your wrath like gays. So where does that leave Rugby Australia? One of those attacking the code this week was Sydney\u2019s Anglican archbishop, Glenn Davies, who eloquently defended Folau\u2019s \u201cright as a citizen to speak of what he believes without threat to his employment\u201d. Really? Is this the same archbishop who compelled 34 Anglican headmasters and headmistresses last year to sign an open letter demanding the law continue to allow them to sack gay teachers and expel gay students? I asked His Grace if this same citizens\u2019 right extended to teachers in Anglican schools? No was the answer that came back from his spokesman, Russell Powell. \u201cThis case of non faith-related employment should not be conflated with others.\u201d How silly of me! There\u2019s one rule for them and another for the rest of us. Folau is free as a footballer to vilify homosexuals without losing his job but were he coaching rugby at a Sydney Anglican school and tweeting approval of gays it might well see him shown the door. Here\u2019s another simple principle: if you are demanding rights for yourself which you won\u2019t extend to others, that\u2019s not freedom. It\u2019s privilege. We\u2019re in the midst of this pandemonium because Folau changed his mind. For a million bucks a year, he agreed to go easy on denouncing, among other vices, the evils of homosexuality. He traded his freedom of speech. So why say yes in the first place if that\u2019s such a profound violation of his rights and his faith? And why does he expect more millions from Rugby Australia because he\u2019s copped the ordinary consequences of going back on his word? Beneath this is the deeper question on which the debate is now focusing, the question Folau plans to pursue through the courts: whether Rugby Australia had the right (that word again) to ask him in the first place to tone his preaching down. Rugby Australia reckons hounding fags is not a good look in this day and age. Hence the deal they struck with their star. Many Australians \u2013 including airlines, fundraising websites and luxury car dealers \u2013 agree wholeheartedly. But not a formidable number of angry Christian dissenters. So what are they fighting for? Free speech, but free speech of a particular kind that keeps gays in the firing line.

The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.<br></p>\n    <p>At its core, the JCPOA is a straightforward bargain: Iran\u2019s acceptance of strict limits on its nuclear programme in return for an escape from the sanctions that grew up around its economy over a decade prior to the accord. Under the deal, Iran unplugged two-thirds of its centrifuges, shipped out 98% of its enriched uranium and filled its plutonium production reactor with concrete. Tehran also accepted extensive monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has verified 10 times since the agreement, and as recently as February, that Tehran has complied with its terms.

The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.</p>\n    <p>On 8 May 2018, US president Donald Trump pulled his country out of the deal.

      "bodyText": "European states will announce a multimillion-euro credit line to ease trade between the EU and Iran in a last-minute and probably doomed effort to persuade Tehran not to take the first step to quit the 2015 nuclear deal. Iran\u2019s withdrawal is almost certain to deepen the Gulf crisis, and prompt US demands for Europe states \u2013 primarily Britain, France and Germany \u2013 to quit the deal and join Washington in imposing sanctions on Tehran. The relatively modest credit line will be announced in Vienna at a meeting of the joint commission for the Iran deal \u2013 the grouping of all the remaining parties to the deal including Europe, Iran, Russia and China. The US pulled out of the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a year ago. It imposed harsh economic sanctions on Iran that have plunged the country\u2019s currency into a nosedive and created mass unemployment. The credit line is expected to be announced as early as Thursday \u2013 the same day Iran will break part of the nuclear deal by surpassing the 300kg limit on its low-enriched uranium stockpile. Iran is due to take further more serious steps to breach the deal on 7 July, when it has pledged to increase uranium enrichment purity levels over the 3.67% limit set in the deal. Officials said this could be a symbolic increase to 3.68%, but if the levels continue to rise Europeans would be concerned that the breakout time \u2013 the period it would take Iran to enrich enough uranium for a nuclear bomb \u2013 could fall below a year. Iran will argue that its long-signalled moves to breach the limit do not breach the JCPOA, claiming it is entitled to take reversible steps to suspend parts of the deal if another signatory to the deal has failed to keep a commitment, notably the undertaking to boost trade between the EU and Iran. The EU is likely to counter that Europe is using its best endeavours to boost trade, but has no obligation under the deal to take steps to compensate for the effect of threatened US sanctions on any firm that trades with Iran. The US sanctions regime \u2013 including the removal of all Iranian oil export waivers \u2013 has been much more draconian than Europe or Iran foresaw. The EU will argue that the credit line should be seen by Tehran as a signal of intent to launch a trading mechanism focused initially on humanitarian goods that will allow companies to trade with minimum access to the banking system. The EU is still not in a position to announce any specific transactions under the mechanism, but officials have repeatedly said that some deals will be announced in the next few days. The EU may not give specific transactions publicity for fear that it will alert the US Treasury to impose sanctions. Iran has said that announcement of a credit line \u2013 briefed to the Iranians in lengthy technical talks in Tehran last week \u2013 hardly represents the seriousness of intent it requires to stay inside the JCPOA. The idea of a trading mechanism was first announced in January, but it has proved a huge technical and legal task of international co-ordination for Europe to construct a scheme in which even mid-level European banks are willing to participate. European officials recognise that the crisis could spiral out of control in the coming weeks, with the International Atomic Energy Agency declaring Iran is in breach of the deal in a matter of days. At the same time France, Germany and Italy are raising concerns about Iran\u2019s ballistic missile programme, saying it is designed to be capable of delivering a nuclear payload.

      "body": "<p>Last year, YouTube <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/29/youtube-deletes-30-music-videos-after-met-link-with-gang-violence\" title=\"\">removed</a> 30 music videos after requests from the Metropolitan police, who claim they incited or glorified violence. All the tracks were made by exponents of drill, an often grim and slang-ridden London take on rap. While Britain\u2019s rise in violence comes amid falling police budgets and vanishing youth services, the authorities treat lyrics as culprits. True, the street argot of \u201cshanking\u201d and \u201cfishing\u201d \u2013 both used to denote stabbing \u2013 may cause alarm if people understand it. But <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/a249c215c523dbd528710412cb91b193\" title=\"\">arguments</a> that blame art for fomenting physical assaults are as thin as sheet music.</p> <p>Rappers Krept and Konan say drill artists are  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/14/rappers-konan-krept-condemn-police-criminalisation-of-drill\" title=\"\">being silenced</a> by a civil order known as the \u201cgangster asbo\u201d which has also been used to target <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/krept--konan-accuse-police-16517752\" title=\"\">terrorists</a>. Two rappers were handed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/31/skengdo-and-am-the-drill-rappers-sentenced-for-playing-their-song\" title=\"\">suspended sentences</a> in January for performing a song in breach of such an injunction. Drill music is made almost exclusively by young black men who chart the lives of their peers and themselves. Why is their freedom of expression being curtailed? The Met didn\u2019t ban the Rolling Stones\u2019 Street Fighting Man in 1968, though it exhorted Londoners, only half-ironically, to emulate rioting Parisians. After nine people were <a href=\"https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/courts/young-man-jailed-for-his-role-in-a-violent-attack-on-at-swedish-house-mafia-gig-29712192.html\" title=\"\">stabbed</a> in 2012 at a Swedish House Mafia gig in Dublin, nobody banned the band.</p> <p>In those cases, the fanbase was white. There\u2019s a dismal history of racial profiling when it comes to provocative art. Until 2017, the <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/form-696-scrapped-racist-police-paperwork-claims-london-mcs-djs-grime-garage-a8048821.html\" title=\"\">controversial</a> 696 live music order form was required 14 days in advance for London shows. Events that \u201cpredominantly feature DJs or MCs performing to a recorded backing track\u201d were targeted. Yet again, black people <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/news/music/artists-mps-claim-police-696-form-racist-towards-grime-artists-2029198#FoEXLmsjvmllUlSY.99\" title=\"\">appeared</a> to be disproportionately affected by authorities.</p> <p>Hip-hop and its variants often involve verbal rage alongside social critique. This Saturday, veteran hip-hop provocateurs Wu-Tang Clan headline <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/er3v9r/acts/a389xj\" title=\"\">Glastonbury</a>. Their best <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhE4bdoWAAE\" title=\"\">tracks</a> are invitations to rhyme battles. Few would mistake them as calls to violence. Officials fear that drill\u2019s taunts are different. Police say some videos and social media postings are \u201cclearly and only designed to incite violence\u201d. Members of drill act 1011 were <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/insider/alist/krept-konan-drill-is-real-life-bans-make-things-worse-a4166771.html\" title=\"\">jailed</a> for conspiracy to commit violent disorder last year \u2013 but were banned from making music first. Drill artist M-Trap, aka Junior Simpson, was jailed for life in 2015 for stabbing 15-year-old Jermaine Goupall to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/15/three-jailed-stabbing-teenager-south-london-jermaine-goupall\" title=\"\">death</a> in circumstances predicted by his lyrics. Given such a case, it may seem absurd to suggest drill has a role in reducing knife crime. But better the mic than the knife, Krept and Konan <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuwcr-M37Do\" title=\"\">argue</a> in their new single, Ban Drill.</p> <p>In truth, some wield both. But a better relationship with minorities seems more worthwhile for police than sifting lyrics for coded death threats. Targeting drill is easier than tackling the social problems of which it is, chiefly, an expression. Banning drill may deprive Britain of its next stars \u2013 perhaps the genre\u2019s equivalent of grime\u2019s Stormzy and Skepta. To stop knife crime, we must do more than mute a soundtrack of urban despair. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Last year, YouTube removed 30 music videos after requests from the Metropolitan police, who claim they incited or glorified violence. All the tracks were made by exponents of drill, an often grim and slang-ridden London take on rap. While Britain\u2019s rise in violence comes amid falling police budgets and vanishing youth services, the authorities treat lyrics as culprits. True, the street argot of \u201cshanking\u201d and \u201cfishing\u201d \u2013 both used to denote stabbing \u2013 may cause alarm if people understand it. But arguments that blame art for fomenting physical assaults are as thin as sheet music. Rappers Krept and Konan say drill artists are being silenced by a civil order known as the \u201cgangster asbo\u201d which has also been used to target terrorists. Two rappers were handed suspended sentences in January for performing a song in breach of such an injunction. Drill music is made almost exclusively by young black men who chart the lives of their peers and themselves. Why is their freedom of expression being curtailed? The Met didn\u2019t ban the Rolling Stones\u2019 Street Fighting Man in 1968, though it exhorted Londoners, only half-ironically, to emulate rioting Parisians. After nine people were stabbed in 2012 at a Swedish House Mafia gig in Dublin, nobody banned the band. In those cases, the fanbase was white. There\u2019s a dismal history of racial profiling when it comes to provocative art. Until 2017, the controversial 696 live music order form was required 14 days in advance for London shows. Events that \u201cpredominantly feature DJs or MCs performing to a recorded backing track\u201d were targeted. Yet again, black people appeared to be disproportionately affected by authorities. Hip-hop and its variants often involve verbal rage alongside social critique. This Saturday, veteran hip-hop provocateurs Wu-Tang Clan headline Glastonbury. Their best tracks are invitations to rhyme battles. Few would mistake them as calls to violence. Officials fear that drill\u2019s taunts are different. Police say some videos and social media postings are \u201cclearly and only designed to incite violence\u201d. Members of drill act 1011 were jailed for conspiracy to commit violent disorder last year \u2013 but were banned from making music first. Drill artist M-Trap, aka Junior Simpson, was jailed for life in 2015 for stabbing 15-year-old Jermaine Goupall to death in circumstances predicted by his lyrics. Given such a case, it may seem absurd to suggest drill has a role in reducing knife crime. But better the mic than the knife, Krept and Konan argue in their new single, Ban Drill. In truth, some wield both. But a better relationship with minorities seems more worthwhile for police than sifting lyrics for coded death threats. Targeting drill is easier than tackling the social problems of which it is, chiefly, an expression. Banning drill may deprive Britain of its next stars \u2013 perhaps the genre\u2019s equivalent of grime\u2019s Stormzy and Skepta. To stop knife crime, we must do more than mute a soundtrack of urban despair.",

He had been either invisible or deliberately sober to the point of dullness, when his usual primary draw to Tory members is a self-created sense of optimism and fun. Much is also made of his supposed broad appeal to the electorate, evidenced by two terms as London mayor.</p>\n    <p>His bizarre claim to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/26/mesmerising-boris-johnsons-bizarre-model-buses-claim-raises-eyebrows\">make model cardboard buses</a> has raised eyebrows. In most political contests, Johnson\u2019s character \u2013 he has lost more than one job for lying, and has a complex and opaque personal life \u2013 would be a big issue, but among the Tory faithful he seemingly receives a free pass.

While his hard Brexit supporters are adamant this is a cast-iron guarantee of leaving on that date, elsewhere Johnson has been somewhat less definitive. Asked about the date in a BBC TV debate, Johnson said only that it was 'eminently feasible', although he then went on to tell TalkRadio that the 31 October deadline was 'do or die'.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Taxation</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>His main pledge has been to raise the threshold for the 40% higher tax rate from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000, at a cost of almost \u00a310bn a year, which would help about 3 million higher earners, a demographic with a fairly sizeable crossover into Tory members.

Johnson has generally hinted he would loosen the purse strings, but given his prior fondness for big-ticket projects \u2013 London\u2019s cancelled garden bridge, the mooted 'Boris island' airport \u2013 perhaps expect more of a focus on infrastructure projects than services.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Climate and environment</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is unlikely to be a big issue for Conservative party members, and Johnson has not said much on this beyond confirming his general support for the new government target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to a net zero by 2050.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Foreign policy</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Also unlikely to be a big issue among Tory members, beyond vague platitudes on 'global Britain', it could be a weak spot for Johnson given his poor performance as foreign secretary.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has been criticised for surrounding himself with an almost entirely male team to run his election campaign, as he brought in the Australian election guru Sir Lynton Crosby\u2019s business partner to professionalise the operation. The frontrunner to be prime minister has beefed up his team with two senior advisers: Iain Duncan Smith, who is his new campaign chairman, and Mark Fullbrook, an election consultant who works with Crosby. Fullbrook is now in charge of the day-to-day running of the campaign, taking over from the former MP James Wharton and Gavin Williamson, the former defence secretary, who led the parliamentary phase of the contest. Campaign sources said Wharton and Williamson would still be \u201cintegral\u201d to Johnson\u2019s election effort but it had always been understood that they would step back when the focus turned to winning over Conservative members. Other senior male aides include Will Walden, Johnson\u2019s former media chief who is providing strategic advice; Oliver Lewis, his policy chief from Hanbury Strategy; Lee Cain, his chief media spokesman; Sir Edward Lister, who is in charge of transition; Ben Gascoigne, who has a private secretary style role; and Oliver Dowden MP and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, who are also working on his path to No 10. A Johnson team source rejected the idea that all his most senior advisers were men, pointing to Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, who has taken on a policy advisory role, and supportive female MPs such as Priti Patel. Another female team member is Shirley Walker-Williams, a former Foreign Office official, who is running operations. The Labour MP Jess Phillips said Johnson has \u201conce again shown what the women in his party and the women in the country can expect from him \u2013 to be ignored and forgotten\u201d, adding that \u201canyone would think he was lying when he said he was a feminist\u201d. Jo Swinson, a Lib Dem leadership contender, said: \u201cBoris is a man who talked about patting his female publisher on the bottom and described female Olympic athletes as glistening like wet otters. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t respect women in public; it shouldn\u2019t surprise people he doesn\u2019t want to listen to them in private either.\u201d Johnson has shaken up his team for the second phase of the leadership contest amid concerns among Eurosceptics that he was retreating from his commitment to leave on 31 October, which he reinforced on Tuesday. Some of Johnson\u2019s team have been rolling their eyes at Duncan Smith\u2019s claims to be in charge of the campaign, but he is seen as important in reassuring pro-Brexit supporters of Johnson that he will not resile from that pledge. Duncan Smith\u2019s position is thought to be that Johnson should be unleashed rather than hidden away during the campaign, as his personality is part of his appeal, regardless of gaffes. However, Fullbrook is the most powerful person on the campaign team, and he is in charge of daily operations, planning and strategy. The political consultant has a strong knowledge of the party base and its internal workings, which is seen as a key asset as Johnson seeks the votes of 160,000 members. Fullbrook helped run two successful London mayoral campaigns for Johnson but was also in charge of Zac Goldsmith\u2019s failed run against Labour\u2019s Sadiq Khan, which was accused of being racist and Islamophobic. He is an expert on polling and election strategy. Johnson speaks to Crosby, who also worked on his mayoral campaigns, every day but he is not officially involved this time, according to campaign sources. Figures from Johnson\u2019s time at City Hall have been tapped up to help with his \u201ctransition\u201d to No 10. MPs said Lister,Johnson\u2019s former deputy, was leading that team alongside Hancock and Dowden. Cain is Johnson\u2019s chief media spokesman, a former journalist who has advised several cabinet ministers and worked on the Vote Leave campaign. The FT reported that he would not necessarily follow his boss into No 10 as he may regard getting him there as \u201cjob done\u201d. Another influential media adviser is Richard Holden, an experienced operator who has worked as a special adviser for several cabinet ministers and at Conservative central office. Rosie Bate-Williams, a former Tory press officer, is handling regional media. On policy, Johnson has given a job to Truss, one of his early backers. However, Lewis has the title of policy chief, and there are numerous others on the team, including a former adviser at City Hall, Alex Crowley, and Ben Mallet, an international elections expert. Johnson\u2019s team Iain Duncan Smith Johnson once supported the Europhile centrist Ken Clarke for the leadership of the Conservative party instead of the eventual winner, the Maastricht rebel Duncan Smith. Now he has appointed Duncan Smith as chair of his leadership campaign to keep Eurosceptics on board.

James Wharton The former MP has been running Johnson\u2019s campaign so far and has been in charge of negotiations over broadcast appearances and hustings, but Fullbrook appears to be taking control of the operation.

      "bodyText": "William Hill, one of the most famous names in betting, has become the latest bookmaker to declare a significant number of ante-post bets void at short notice, in a further reminder to punters of the extent to which bookies\u2019 Terms &amp; Conditions (T&amp;Cs) allow them to cancel bets many weeks or even months after acceptance. William Hill\u2019s decision to follow BetBright and 188BET in voiding ante-post bets follows a sudden move to stop taking bets from customers based in Switzerland. The firm emailed their Swiss clients on Tuesday saying that the decision had been taken \u201cfor regulatory reasons\u201d and \u201cat very short notice\u201d, and that all unsettled bets on accounts would be declared void from midday on 28 June. The Guardian has seen details of one bet on Wimbledon, which begins on Monday, which Hills intends to declare void. The client concerned staked \u20ac1,500 each-way on Ashleigh Barty to win the women\u2019s singles at odds of 33-1, with a potential payout of about \u20ac77,000. Barty, who has won the French Open and risen to world No 1 since the bet was placed, is now Hills\u2019s 7-2 favourite to win the tournament. Hills did not initially offer the punter a chance to \u201ccash out\u201d of the bet, which would allow a reinvestment at the current market odds to achieve a broadly similar payout, on the grounds that it does not offer cash outs on each-way bets. Hills\u2019s decision to simply void bets with significant potential liabilities follows similar moves earlier this year by the now defunct BetBright and also 188BET, which decided to withdraw from the British market. BetBright announced that it was to cease trading a week before the Cheltenham Festival in March. Its ante-post racing liabilities were subsequently taken on by 888.com, which had paid \u00a315m to acquire BetBright\u2019s technology and betting platform assets, while its sports book, including football bets with five-figure payouts, was later transferred to BetVictor in a deal brokered by BetBright\u2019s former chairman, Rich Ricci. There is little sign at present that a similar deal will come to the rescue of Hills\u2019s customers in Switzerland, and the firm\u2019s decision to void its entire ante-post book there is a reminder for punters that all bookies\u2019 T&amp;Cs allow them to void bets and return stakes at their discretion and without the involvement of the Gambling Commission, which regulates betting and gaming in the UK. However, when approached for comment on Wednesday, William Hill stepped back from its original decision not to allow cash outs on outstanding bets. \u201cUnfortunately, we have no option due to new regulations in Switzerland to void all bets that would settle after 30 June,\u201d the firm said on Wednesday evening. \u201cFor the vast majority of our small customer base, a straight refund is the better option but in cases like this, we will look to offer the prevailing cash out value as the fairest way to resolve the situation.\u201d",

In an open letter published by the Guardian, many of Scotland\u2019s leading conservation and civic groups have urged Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, to introduce an environment act guaranteeing that legal rights available within the EU continue after Brexit. The letter, signed by 16 bodies including the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, WWF, Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations, National Trust for Scotland and Royal Scottish Geographic Society, said the climate emergency added to the need for legislation. Organised by the umbrella group Scottish Environment Link, the letter says: \u201cNicola Sturgeon has acknowledged that our planet faces a climate emergency.

Under EU law any citizen can go, for free, to the European commission to challenge a government\u2019s or agency\u2019s failure to uphold EU law. The commission can investigate and take enforcement action, including taking the member state to the European court of justice. Those powers have been used at EU level by the legal group Client Earth to make the UK enforce air pollution regulations; by the RSPB to halt a cull of barnacle geese on Islay, sanctioned by Scottish Natural Heritage; and again by the RSPB, to protect peatlands in England. Michael Gove, the UK environment secretary, is planning to introduce similar procedures after Brexit to cover environmental legal enforcement in England. The Labour-run Welsh government, which like Holyrood has devolved responsibilities for the environment, is involved in that process.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of people, including primary school children and members of the Women\u2019s Institute, have lobbied MPs, calling for urgent action to tackle the climate emergency and critical loss of nature. About 12,000 people gathered in Westminster on Wednesday to put pressure on politicians, according to the organisers the Climate Coalition and Greener UK, whose members include aid agencies, social groups and conservation organisations. The Time Is Now lobby comes after months of growing environmental protests, from school strikes to actions by members of Extinction Rebellion, and increasing warnings of the need for unprecedented action to tackle the global climate. Gareth Redmond-King, head of climate change at WWF, said: \u201cPublic concern is at its highest level. It is a mainstream issue. There are lots of organisations working hard to raise the profile and focus their MPs\u2019 minds on policies and actions to make sure we take action.\u201d A recent survey showed two-thirds of Britons wanting faster action to tackle climate change. Theresa May, in one of her last acts as prime minister, is signing into law a target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, which was being debated by the Lords on Wednesday. Campaigners, religious leaders and people of various faiths, led by the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams proceeded along Whitehall on a \u201cwalk of witness\u201d. Williams said he was proud the UK was taking the climate crisis seriously. \u201cI compare it with the great struggle 200 years ago with ending the slave trade. Parliament took an option that wasn\u2019t easy, it must have felt risky at the time facing massive entrenched global culture \u2013 and things changed,\u201d he said. At least 195 MPs who met campaigners were encouraged to mark their constituency with a pin on a large map of the UK before being taken by rickshaw to speak to their constituents. At 2pm the thousands present rang alarm clocks, mobile phone alarms and sirens, and cheered loudly to symbolise \u201cthe time is now\u201d. Jane Alexander, a primary school headteacher from London, brought five pupils from her school, North Harringay primary, to the lobby. She said: \u201cOur children may be too young to vote but they are not too young to have their voices heard.\u201d Michelle Lowe, from Winchester, said she had joined the mass lobby to speak to her MP because \u201cthe time is now\u201d. She said: \u201cI have children, who are 22, 20 and 16, and I\u2019m worried about their futures.\u201d The Liberal Democrat leadership contender Sir Ed Davey was among MPs who met constituents.

      "bodyText": "It is time to wake up, but there is barely a moment to smell the coffee. If Boris Johnson becomes prime minister, Britain will be sleepwalking towards the break-up of the United Kingdom. The minority who want this to happen are rubbing their hands at the prospect. The separate minority who say they don\u2019t care if it happens seem beyond reasoned debate at present. But the majority who don\u2019t want it to happen aren\u2019t being much more attentive either. Unless this changes, they could be in for a shock more lasting than Brexit. Even when the twists and turns of leaving the EU dominated the daily news in the early part of this year it was difficult to get many English politicians or commentators to focus for long on the destructive consequences for the union. Now that Brexit has become the defining doctrinal obsession of a Conservative party leadership election conducted in the shadow of the Brexit party, even less attention is being paid to those possible consequences, especially in England. But the forces that are driving Britain towards its break-up are not sleeping. This is a problem with very deep and entangled historical roots. It embraces the centuries-long uneasy relationship between Britain and Ireland, and the increasingly confrontational modern one between Britain and Scotland. It highlights the failure of successive constitutional settlements to give a particular voice to Englishness. It ensnares not just the Tory and Brexit parties in its coils but Labour, too. For a few more weeks, the face of the problem is still Theresa May. She intermittently mouthed decent words about the union while consistently following a Brexit policy that made the words sound like lies.

They picked apart<strong> Warwickshire</strong>\u2019s tail, taking the last seven wickets for 67, to win by 74 runs before lunch.</p> <p>Needing another 142 to win, Dominic Sibley and Adam Hose added 41 until Sam Curran had one of his holy overs, sending back Hose and three balls later, Matthew Lamb. When Ambrose was run out without scoring and Dominic Sibley caught and bowled by Morne Morkel for 73, it was all over. Gareth Batty finished with four for 34. The win takes the defending champions up to fifth, while Warwickshire sink to seventh.</p> <p><strong>Glamorgan</strong> cantered to their third Championship win of the summer to go top of Division Two, albeit only by a point and having played a game more than Lancashire. They needed 188 to win in just under two sessions, after bowling Gloucestershire out for 161. Mick Hogan snatched four for 22, and seven wickets in the match, as Gloucestershire lost their last five wickets for a miserable 16 after sandwiches.</p> <p>The sun then sprang a surprise and an inspired Marnus Labuschagne, dapper of foot and the division\u2019s leading run-scorer, made 82 as Glamorgan won by four wickets. It was Gloucestershire\u2019s first Championship loss since last August. <br></p> <p>At Hove, <strong>Sussex</strong> lost their final wicket to the second ball of the day and nothing got much better as <strong>Durham</strong> declined to enforce the follow-on but built on an already hefty lead thanks to a second century in consecutive games for Alex Lees in a partnership of 220 with Gareth Harte. </p> <p>Durham declared with a lead of 436, only for Sussex to lose two wickets in the first five overs to a rampaging Chris Rushworth \u2013 Luke Wells and Harry Finch for ducks \u2013 and another before the close.</p> <p>At the County Ground, a slow-going match between <strong>Leicestershire</strong> and <strong>Northamptonshire</strong> danced to its own beat. Hassan Azad made a patient and careful 92 against inquisitive Northants bowling, falling just short of his third hundred in three innings. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d13b19a8f081e872734f75d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-26T18:04:05.708Z\">7.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>And Glamorgan are top of the Division Two table!</strong><strong> By a point, and with a match </strong>in hand, but still there they stand, a golden daffodil waving at the big boys - LOOK AT US! </p> <p>Surrey win their first game, Durham look like pocketing their second unless the weather intervenes at Hove, and Leicestershire and Northamptonshire move along to the beat of their own slow dance at The County Ground.</p> <p>Thanks for your emails and commments below the line, and for popping your head in with all the hullaballoo and excitement at Edgbaston.

      "bodyText": "On the day it was revealed that the Hundred Franchise name coming out of south London would be the Oval Greats, Surrey at last won their first County Championship game of the season. They picked apart Warwickshire\u2019s tail, taking the last seven wickets for 67, to win by 74 runs before lunch. Needing another 142 to win, Dominic Sibley and Adam Hose added 41 until Sam Curran had one of his holy overs, sending back Hose and three balls later, Matthew Lamb. When Ambrose was run out without scoring and Dominic Sibley caught and bowled by Morne Morkel for 73, it was all over. Gareth Batty finished with four for 34. The win takes the defending champions up to fifth, while Warwickshire sink to seventh. Glamorgan cantered to their third Championship win of the summer to go top of Division Two, albeit only by a point and having played a game more than Lancashire. They needed 188 to win in just under two sessions, after bowling Gloucestershire out for 161. Mick Hogan snatched four for 22, and seven wickets in the match, as Gloucestershire lost their last five wickets for a miserable 16 after sandwiches. The sun then sprang a surprise and an inspired Marnus Labuschagne, dapper of foot and the division\u2019s leading run-scorer, made 82 as Glamorgan won by four wickets. It was Gloucestershire\u2019s first Championship loss since last August. At Hove, Sussex lost their final wicket to the second ball of the day and nothing got much better as Durham declined to enforce the follow-on but built on an already hefty lead thanks to a second century in consecutive games for Alex Lees in a partnership of 220 with Gareth Harte. Durham declared with a lead of 436, only for Sussex to lose two wickets in the first five overs to a rampaging Chris Rushworth \u2013 Luke Wells and Harry Finch for ducks \u2013 and another before the close. At the County Ground, a slow-going match between Leicestershire and Northamptonshire danced to its own beat. Hassan Azad made a patient and careful 92 against inquisitive Northants bowling, falling just short of his third hundred in three innings. And Glamorgan are top of the Division Two table! By a point, and with a match in hand, but still there they stand, a golden daffodil waving at the big boys - LOOK AT US! Surrey win their first game, Durham look like pocketing their second unless the weather intervenes at Hove, and Leicestershire and Northamptonshire move along to the beat of their own slow dance at The County Ground. Thanks for your emails and commments below the line, and for popping your head in with all the hullaballoo and excitement at Edgbaston. See you on Sunday, for the next round! Labuschagne went for 82 but Glamorgan have eased over the line to reach 188-6 and see off Gloucestershire. Elsewhere, Leicestershire (273-7) trail Northants (299 all out) by 26 runs, with play suspended for bad light. Sussex needed 400+ against Durham and they haven\u2019t made a great start \u2013 they\u2019re 32-2, Wells and Finch both gone for ducks, and still 405 behind. And with Glamorgan needing only 41 runs to win, I\u2019m going to write up. Keep an eye on things, if you\u2019re not too distracted by Edgbaston. I\u2019m just remembering how the NZers managed to keep their cool against West Indies at the last. And hoping. Glamorgan are going to do this! Just 47 needed - Labuschagne 78 and Root 29. Touch of back garden battles with Joe in this shot. Anything Morne Morkel can do, Chris Rushworth can better - if slightly less flexibly. Finch caught and bowled for a perfectly round duck. Sussex four for two. World Cup update: nervous days for England and Pakistan. Adam Collins is watching every ball here: And with the fifth ball of the first over, Chris Rushworth does what Chris Rushworth does and has Luke Wells caught for a five ball duck. Sussex 0 for 1, in a dirty, smelly ditch at the bottom of a ruddy great hill. The latest equation from Bristol reads: 75 needed off 23 overs. Glamorgan are over half way there. Labuschagne still there, 65 not out. On the radio they\u2019re wondering what has happened to Matt Henry\u2019s pace since he was playing for Kent? , Something special for those with a soft spot for Darren Stevens - he\u2019s taken his first ever hat-trick, for Kent 2nd XI v Somerset second XI. Though I struggle to believe that\u2019s true, surely the man with the golden dibbly-dobblers has done it before? Glamorgan have lost a second, but Labuschagne going for it by himself- 45 not out off just 54 balls. Does he know something we don\u2019t? Glamorgan need 116 to win. I\u2019m pretty sure Warwicks were in a similar situation until it all went pear shaped this morning. Surrey beat Warwickshire by 74 runs. Surrey 194 (Lester 4-41) and 325 (Stoneman 71; Miles 5-91); v Warwicks 230 (Rhodes 51) and 215 (Sibley 73, Batty 4-34) Day 4: Gloucestershire 313 (Dent 105) and 161 (Hogan 4-22) v Glamorgan 287 (Selman 73) and 56-1. Glamorgan need 132 to win off 36 overs. Day 3: Northants 299 (Wakely 65; Wright 4-78) v Leicestershire 178-2 (Azad 67 not out) Day 3: Sussex 232 (Rawlins 56; Carse 5-43) v Durham 384 (Bancroft 158, Eckersley 118; Jordann 4-58) and 258-2 (Lees 138 not out). Durham lead by 410. Spicy shots from Labuschagne. Glamorgan need 142 off 38 which is...3.74 an over. I think it is half way to being in the bag. Teetering on the shelf. Another hundred for Alex Lees! Well played! Eleven fours, 185 balls. Durham a heady 200 for one. This is the fabulous Marina Hyde column that was mentioned earlier below the line. Chris Gayle has backtracked on retirement plans post World Cup, hanging out the possibility of an improbable Test recall. \u201cI\u2019m definitely up there with the greats without a doubt.\u201d he pondered. \u201cI enjoy each and every moment playing for West Indies. It\u2019s been a lot of ups and downs. But I could not have had a better career as a player representing the West Indies.\u201d Alex Lees enters the nervous nineties at Hove, and Gareth Harte goes to fifty with a six! Durham lead now 331!!! Feel in need of some London Spirit? Will knows a man who can help: Glamorgan stumble into a standing start. Selman out in the fifth over, caught off David Payne for six. Glam 10/1. And that\u2019s a third fifty in a row for Hassan Azad at Wantage Road! Leicestershire 126 for 2. And, with a whimper, Gloucestershire are all out after losing 6 for 32. Two quick wickets for Graham Wagg and Michael Hogan grabs 4-22. Just under two sessions to go. Alex Lees has scored a 6o, a hundred, and a 72 not out for Durham this month since a brief spell in the seconds. Durham 136 for one - a lead of 288 over Sussex. When I said benign pitch I actually meant uncivil little beast of a strip ... Gloucestershire slip to 149/7 - a lead of 175. They\u2019ve lost 3-20 in a nasty little spell round lunch. Just been reading something from Bristol which reports that the pitch is increasingly benign. You\u2019ll have to summon something special Glamorgan. Who\u2019s in the cupboard? De Lange\u2019s got the most f-c wickets this season with 21... Jeetan Patel is a worthy man-crush. He\u2019s just so grown up and dignified and has everything in proportion. \u201cI\u2019m not despondent at all. We\u2019ve come to the home ground of the reigning champions and toughed it out on a pitch we knew was always going to suit them. It was a tough week for both batting sides, but they bowled very well for long periods and, in some ways, probably deserved this quick spell of wickets today. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens in games of cricket, you battle day in and day out and suddenly you get your rewards in a rush, and I felt Surrey probably deserved that. \u201cWe missed some moments in the game, but that happens especially with a young side like ours and a team that\u2019s still learning, but I\u2019ve spoken with the lads and I\u2019m happy with what was said. \u201cThe words that came out from the guys were; enjoyment, fighting, desire, passion and a real longing to go out and perform for \u2018The Bear\u2019. If that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got from the last seven games and from this week in particular then, in my eyes, we\u2019ve won overall.\u201d Surrey beat Warwickshire by 74 runs. Surrey 194 (Lester 4-41) and 325 (Stoneman 71; Miles 5-91); v Warwicks 230 (Rhodes 51) and 215 (Sibley 73, Batty 4-34) Day 4: Gloucestershire 313 (Dent 105) and 131-5 v Glamorgan 287 (Selman 73). Day 3: Northants 299 (Wakely 65; Wright 4-78) v Leicestershire 87-1 Day 3: Sussex 232 (Rawlins 56; Carse 5-43) v Durham 384 (Bancroft 158, Eckersley 118; Jordann 4-58) and 100-1 (Lees 55 not out) And after that all that, we have lunch. Scores to follow. Here\u2019s that run out from The Oval earlier, a bit of back-forward hesitation did it for Tim Ambrose at the non-strikers end. Good throw though. A very good morning\u2019s work by Surrey! Their first Championship win of the season. Not so brilliant a couple of hours from Warwickshire who lost six for 25 since elevenses. And things are starting to just look a little bit more interesting in Division One - Surrey jump up to fifth after revealing at last what they can do when everyone starts functioning at once, and how much they\u2019ve missed Sam Curran. Warwickshire fall to seventh, though they\u2019re still 26 points above bottom-placed Notts. Hush, hush, whisper who dares, Durham haven\u2019t lost a wicket for over an hour. Nor have Leicestershire actually, all morning! And, with a desperate sigh, Dom Sibley strikes out at Morne Morkel who scoops up the ball at the bottom of his very long legs, from the toe of his boots. Sibley out for 73, after 299 minutes of crease occupation, and Warwickshire are 196 for 8, needing a fantastical 94 to win. James Bracey is lbw to Douthwaite for 33 - Gloucs 97-4, wickets falling fairly regularly at Bristol, but probably not regularly enough with only two and a bit sessions left... Here\u2019s the Sam Curran magic: Warwickshire falling in a heap - a run-out! Ambrose for a duck. It sounds absurd, I\u2019ll try and find it... Warwickshire need a magic hundred to win, but what\u2019s this madness? Six wickets down?! Sam Curran has two in an over - Adam Hose for 21 and Matthew Lamb for a duck three balls later. I wanted to find a picture of Brydon Carse to celebrate his first first-class five-fer, but this is the best I can do - his side view from 2017. For those that don\u2019t know, he is a Kolpak player, was born in Port Elizabeth, is 23 and was a joint winner of Durham\u2019s young player of the year award in 2016, alongside Jack Burnham. Enjoyed this knee-trembler from Gareth Batty. Dom Sibley, Dom Sibley. I won\u2019t say a score for to frighten a little jinx out of a bottle somewhere at The Oval. But on he goes, as he has all season. And in the time it took me to write that, Gareth Roderick had nudged a thick edge behind at Bristol (Gloucs 70-3) and Mohammad Amir got Martin Guptill for five in front of a green, partisan crowd at Edgbaston. Steve emails in to articulate some white-rose concern about the signing of Maharaj. I think it\u2019s fair to say there\u2019s some consternation amongst Yorkies regarding the Maharaj signing. Undoubtedly an excellent player, but it\u2019s disappointing that the promising James Logan, who did so well on debut at York last week, will now be relegated to the seconds. It also seems bizarre that our main problem - the batting department - has still not been addressed!\u201d I did a bit of digging after reading the Yorkshire academy report on Logan\u2019s batting: \u201c he needs to work on his batting. He\u2019s not a frontline batsman.\u201d I googled Maharaj\u2019s batting stats for Lancs last year to see if he was a secret tail-end basher that I\u2019d forgotten about - but he only made 66 runs in five innings, with a top score of 38. And as you say Bess has gone back to Taunton, so I can only think that Headingley feel their position isn\u2019t strong enough to risk promise, and would rather buy certainty. Which is daft really, as with only one team going down this year, the risk of relegation is low - especially with Nottinghamshire in a permanent state of crisis. Alas, no double daddy, Cameron Bancroft trudges off for five, caught at slip off Ollie Robinson. And that early wicket at Hove leaves Durham 10 for one. I\u2019m just pondering Durham, at Hove. I\u2019m thinking, they could bat calmly all day and build up a lead say, of 350? That seems ample. And Lizzie Ammon has tweeted that the south London Hundred side will be known as The Oval Greats. Hmm. C\u2019mon you greats? C\u2019mon you OGs? Brydon Carse grabbed the last Sussex wicket with the second ball of the morning, giving him final figures of five for 43, a maiden first-class five-fer. Bravo! And Sussex are all out but Durham have NOT enforced the follow on. They bat again, 152 ahead. Oh dear. Warwickshire don\u2019t start the day well. Miles lbw Clarke 9. Warwicks now 150 for four, needing 140 still to win. Nice round numbers if that helps Warwicks fans? In other news: the New Zealand v Pakistan match will start at 11.30 and is still 50 overs per side; and Yorkshire have a new recruit - left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj. Maharaj, who I last saw wheeling away for Lancashire at Southport, will fly in for three matches, starting with Yorkshire\u2019s game against Surrey at Scarborough which starts on Sunday. Set your sights on The Oval: There is a greasy outfield at Edgbaston, after it rained most of yesterday, which has delayed the start; follow over by over updates on what is now rather an important game for England \u2013 Pakistan v New Zealand. They are also playing the waiting game at Loughborough where England Academy Women are due to take on Australia Women. Hello everybody, it is Wednesday, it is June, it is chilly, and we have two games going into their last day, two into their penultimate day, and one over a day early at Chelmsford - where Somerset were unable to resist the magic of Essex\u2019s bowlers on an overcast day and fell to their first Championship defeat of the season - by 151 runs. The result leaves Somerset still top of Division One with 118 points, but Essex second, and with their spurs at the ready, with 105. Both teams have played seven games. There\u2019s an umbrella-nibbler in store at The Oval where Warwickshire need 142 to win, with seven wickets in hand. Dominic Sibley, ever-present at the crease for Warwickshire this season, could do his Ashes chances no harm at all if he could he convert that 52 not out, into 150 not out. But he\u2019s up against Morne Morkel, Sam Curran, Clarke one and Clark two, plus Gareth Batty, who has already taken two wickets in this innings. Glamorgan need to bowl out Gloucestershire in a hurry on the final day at Bristol, if they want to get another win under their belt. Gloucestershire lead by 67 with eight wickets remaining. Only one day\u2019s cricket has been possible at Northampton, where play will be extended by half an hour, weather permitting. Leicestershire start the day six without loss. And at Hove Durham have thrown a basket of eggs into the air and produced a light fluffy omelette, still leading by 153 with only one Sussex wicket remaining.",

      "bodyText": "A prominent anti-Islamic extremist whose organisation is being investigated in Austria over links to the Christchurch shooting suspect has apparently been permanently excluded from entering the UK. Martin Sellner, the Austrian leader of Generation Identity, was being excluded on security grounds and posed a serious threat to the UK\u2019s interests of preventing social harm and countering extremism, according to a Home Office letter which has been posted online. It added that Sellner, who was stopped from entering Britain at Stansted airport last year, was the co-founder and de facto leader of Generation Identity, \u201can organisation which actively promotes anti-Islamic and anti-immigration narratives and directly targets Islamic communities through publicity stunts\u201d. It had been assessed that he was likely to attempt to return to the UK, the letter stated, to provide support to Generation Identity\u2019s UK branch and undertake publicity stunts which directly targeted Islamic and immigrant communities. The home secretary, Sajid Javid, had authorised the exclusion order, according to the letter, which was publicised via Generation Identity\u2019s Telegram channel. Sellner has been subjected to further searches by Austrian police in connection with the Christchurch shooter, according to Austrian media reports and videos on Sellner\u2019s YouTube channel. The investigation, which was not mentioned in the Home Office letter, has also reportedly widened to include Sellner\u2019s US-based partner, Brittany Pettibone, and her alleged connections with Blair Cottrell, an Australian far-right figure. The Austrian newspaper Die Presse reported on 18 June that two apartments in Vienna had been searched by the prosecutor\u2019s office in Graz. It has been investigating Sellner\u2019s connections to the Australian Brenton Tarrant who is on trial for the murder in March of 51 people in Christchurch, New Zealand. Sellner, in two German-language YouTube videos, offered his account of the investigation. In the first, which he said was before an interview with police, Sellner said officers had removed devices from his home, and that the reason was a \u201cstrong suspicion of forming a terrorist organisation with Brenton Tarrant\u201d. He has previously been denied entry to the UK in the company of at least one other far-right extremist as they attempted to attend a conference organised by counterparts in Britain. Sellner and the Hungarian \u00c1bel B\u00f3di were planning to attend the private Generation Identity conference in London in April last year but were detained at Stansted airport. It was the second time in a month that Sellner had been prevented from entering the UK by border officials. Sellner was also the ringleader of a \u201cdefend Europe\u201d campaign last summer, responsible for targeting boats attempting to rescue migrants in the Mediterranean. The 29-year-old was first connected with Tarrant after it emerged the accused had made a \u20ac1,500 (\u00a31,300) donation to Sellner\u2019s organisation. Die Presse reported that prosecutors were looking for accounting records and evidence of further donations from Tarrant to Sellner. Pettibone announced on her Twitter account last week that she had been notified she was under investigation. Pettibone, a prominent far-right YouTube activist, and Sellner were both refused entry to the UK when they landed at Luton airport in March last year.

The furthest I have gone back so far is a camping trip in the late 1970s. My dad took me and my brother to a campsite on the banks of the River Wye, somewhere near Hereford. I was about 11 and my brother was eight. My brother was, and is, more competent than me in most ways. As we set about pitching our tent, I got in a muddle and started flapping about something or other. My dad, I\u2019m afraid, lost his temper and said: \u201cAde, you\u2019re about as much use as a bucket of shit.\u201d Sadly, I walked away and went and sat by the river. It was hurtful, to be sure, but I had to admit he had a point.</p> <p>Come nightfall, it started raining and the tent sprang a leak, so we had to sleep in the car.

      "body": "<p>Lawyers representing children with special educational needs and disabilities have told the high court there is a crisis in funding that is depriving children of a proper education and risking blighting their lives forever.</p> <p>The hearing, a landmark legal challenge to the government\u2019s funding policy, was told the allocation for children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) was \u201cmanifestly insufficient\u201d in the face of clear and incontrovertible evidence of a \u201csubstantial national shortfall\u201d.</p> <p>Three families, supported by many others who staged an emotional demonstration outside the Royal Courts of Justice on Wednesday, have brought the case against the education secretary, Damian Hinds, and the chancellor, Philip Hammond. They accuse the government of failing to give adequate funding to local authorities who are responsible for Send provision.</p> <p>Jenni Richards QC, for the families, told the court in written submissions: \u201cThe evidence strongly supports the contention that there is a genuine crisis in Send funding. Importantly, it is not the case that the shortfalls in funding are currently being absorbed by local authorities with relatively little impact on frontline provision.</p> <p>\u201cOn the contrary, the direct result of the lack of funding is that children with Send are not being properly educated, notwithstanding the fact that parliament has required their needs to be met. This has the potential to blight the lives of these children forever, seriously limiting the scope for them living independent lives as adults.\u201d</p> <p>Richards accused the chancellor of acting unlawfully when setting the national budget in October 2018 and made the same allegation against the education secretary over additional Send funding made available in December 2018, accusing each of failing to take sufficient account of the \u201cnature and extent of the crisis\u201d when making those decisions.</p> <p>She said: \u201cThere is no evidence that the defendants have ever asked themselves whether Send funding is sufficient to allow local authorities and schools to comply with their statutory duties and meet the needs of this particularly vulnerable cohort of children and young people, whereas all the evidence ... says it is not.\u201d</p> <p>Government lawyers said ministers recognised the increase in demand for Send provision and acknowledged the difficulty some families had securing their entitlements. The court was told the education secretary had already said that high needs funding would be one of his priorities before the 2019 spending review.</p> <p>Sir James Eadie QC, representing the ministers, said the chancellor had given careful consideration to the situation, but there were competing demands for a finite pool of government money. \u201cThese decisions have been taken in full knowledge of the challenges faced by local authorities \u2026 In addition, they have been taken in the context of a complex policy area \u2013 school funding \u2013 which requires the secretary of state [for education] to make difficult decisions balancing competing priorities.\u201d</p> <p>He said ministers did not accept that significant additional funding in the short term was the only possible solution. \u201cRather, the defendants consider that the appropriate overall balance between the allocation of additional funding [in revenue and/or capital form], interventions aimed at reducing costs and improving efficiency, and changes to local authority policies and practices, remains to be determined.\u201d</p> <p>It is the first time the government has been taken to court over Send funding, which has come under intense scrutiny amid growing complaints from families that their children are losing vital educational support to which they are entitled.</p> <p>Outside the court, families and young people with Send described their experiences of the system.</p> <p>Mary Riddell, of Great Barr, Birmingham, was one of those named in the action. Her daughter Dakota, 10, has a number of conditions including cerebral palsy, global development delay, and the muscle disorders clonus and dystonia.</p> <p>Riddell told supporters she had had to fight for every single provision for her daughter. \u201cThe fight is real, exhausting, mindblowing. I\u2019m here today to fight for what is right and to fight for my daughter\u2019s rights. Local authorities are so chronically underfunded, there\u2019s no way they can meet demand.</p> <p>\u201cThe situation as it is cannot continue or else Dakota and a huge number of other vulnerable children will ultimately lose out. We feel our concerns have been repeatedly ignored on this issue and we hope this action will ensure the government finally sits up and pays attention.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/apr/04/funding-pupils-special-educational-needs-send-drops-north-england\">Funding for pupils with special educational needs drops 17%</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Also bringing the case are the families of 15-year-old Nico Heugh Simone, from Robertsbridge, East Sussex, and 14-year-old Benedict McFinnigan, from Scarborough, North Yorkshire. Benedict, who has post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression and chronic insomnia, has not been in mainstream school for about two years and is now attending a pupil referral unit for less than three hours a day.</p> <p>Nico, who has autism, anxiety and other related conditions, requires special support to remain in mainstream school, yet his family said they had repeatedly faced issues with East Sussex county council over the cost of his requirements.</p> <p>His mother, Lorraine Heugh, said before the hearing: \u201cWe feel we have been left with no choice but to take this action. We are hopeful the high court will recognise the national emergency that is being created by the lack of Send funding and order action to be taken to redress this issue.\u201d</p> <p>The hearing is due to last two days, after which Mr Justice Lewis is expected to reserve judgment to a later date. The high court previously rejected cases brought by families of children with special educational needs against Hackney and Surrey councils. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Lawyers representing children with special educational needs and disabilities have told the high court there is a crisis in funding that is depriving children of a proper education and risking blighting their lives forever. The hearing, a landmark legal challenge to the government\u2019s funding policy, was told the allocation for children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) was \u201cmanifestly insufficient\u201d in the face of clear and incontrovertible evidence of a \u201csubstantial national shortfall\u201d. Three families, supported by many others who staged an emotional demonstration outside the Royal Courts of Justice on Wednesday, have brought the case against the education secretary, Damian Hinds, and the chancellor, Philip Hammond. They accuse the government of failing to give adequate funding to local authorities who are responsible for Send provision. Jenni Richards QC, for the families, told the court in written submissions: \u201cThe evidence strongly supports the contention that there is a genuine crisis in Send funding. Importantly, it is not the case that the shortfalls in funding are currently being absorbed by local authorities with relatively little impact on frontline provision. \u201cOn the contrary, the direct result of the lack of funding is that children with Send are not being properly educated, notwithstanding the fact that parliament has required their needs to be met. This has the potential to blight the lives of these children forever, seriously limiting the scope for them living independent lives as adults.\u201d Richards accused the chancellor of acting unlawfully when setting the national budget in October 2018 and made the same allegation against the education secretary over additional Send funding made available in December 2018, accusing each of failing to take sufficient account of the \u201cnature and extent of the crisis\u201d when making those decisions. She said: \u201cThere is no evidence that the defendants have ever asked themselves whether Send funding is sufficient to allow local authorities and schools to comply with their statutory duties and meet the needs of this particularly vulnerable cohort of children and young people, whereas all the evidence ... says it is not.\u201d Government lawyers said ministers recognised the increase in demand for Send provision and acknowledged the difficulty some families had securing their entitlements. The court was told the education secretary had already said that high needs funding would be one of his priorities before the 2019 spending review. Sir James Eadie QC, representing the ministers, said the chancellor had given careful consideration to the situation, but there were competing demands for a finite pool of government money. \u201cThese decisions have been taken in full knowledge of the challenges faced by local authorities \u2026 In addition, they have been taken in the context of a complex policy area \u2013 school funding \u2013 which requires the secretary of state [for education] to make difficult decisions balancing competing priorities.\u201d He said ministers did not accept that significant additional funding in the short term was the only possible solution. \u201cRather, the defendants consider that the appropriate overall balance between the allocation of additional funding [in revenue and/or capital form], interventions aimed at reducing costs and improving efficiency, and changes to local authority policies and practices, remains to be determined.\u201d It is the first time the government has been taken to court over Send funding, which has come under intense scrutiny amid growing complaints from families that their children are losing vital educational support to which they are entitled. Outside the court, families and young people with Send described their experiences of the system. Mary Riddell, of Great Barr, Birmingham, was one of those named in the action. Her daughter Dakota, 10, has a number of conditions including cerebral palsy, global development delay, and the muscle disorders clonus and dystonia. Riddell told supporters she had had to fight for every single provision for her daughter. \u201cThe fight is real, exhausting, mindblowing. I\u2019m here today to fight for what is right and to fight for my daughter\u2019s rights. Local authorities are so chronically underfunded, there\u2019s no way they can meet demand. \u201cThe situation as it is cannot continue or else Dakota and a huge number of other vulnerable children will ultimately lose out. We feel our concerns have been repeatedly ignored on this issue and we hope this action will ensure the government finally sits up and pays attention.\u201d Also bringing the case are the families of 15-year-old Nico Heugh Simone, from Robertsbridge, East Sussex, and 14-year-old Benedict McFinnigan, from Scarborough, North Yorkshire. Benedict, who has post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression and chronic insomnia, has not been in mainstream school for about two years and is now attending a pupil referral unit for less than three hours a day. Nico, who has autism, anxiety and other related conditions, requires special support to remain in mainstream school, yet his family said they had repeatedly faced issues with East Sussex county council over the cost of his requirements. His mother, Lorraine Heugh, said before the hearing: \u201cWe feel we have been left with no choice but to take this action. We are hopeful the high court will recognise the national emergency that is being created by the lack of Send funding and order action to be taken to redress this issue.\u201d The hearing is due to last two days, after which Mr Justice Lewis is expected to reserve judgment to a later date. The high court previously rejected cases brought by families of children with special educational needs against Hackney and Surrey councils.",

We also believe it sends a negative signal about how pregnant women and new mothers should be treated when they are working. With 54,000 women a year being pushed out of their jobs due to pregnancy and maternity discrimination it is important that Westminster sets the gold standard in how it treats new mothers.</p> <p>This change in policy is important for MPs and the diversity of the parliamentary workforce, but it is also important for all UK citizens; firstly because we need to know that constituents will be in receipt of proper representation but also because, by legislating for parental leave for MPs, the government will send a strong signal to employers that parents who work are valued.</p> <p><strong>Joeli Brearley</strong><em> Pregnant Then Screwed</em><br><strong>Olga Fitzroy</strong><em> Parental Pay Equality </em><br><strong>Sam Smethers</strong><em> Fawcett Society </em><br><strong>Eve Holt</strong><em> Happen Together</em><br><strong>Rachel Elgy</strong><em> EqualiTeach</em><br><strong>Mandy Garner</strong><em> Working Mums </em><br><strong>Mandu Reid</strong><em> Women\u2019s Equality Party </em><br><strong>Dr Mary-Ann Stephenson</strong><em> Women\u2019s Budget Group </em><br><strong>Joe Levenson</strong><em> Young Women\u2019s Trust, </em><br><strong>Adrienne Burgess</strong><em> CEO, Fatherhood Institute</em><br><strong>Dave Devenney </strong><em>Director,</em><strong> </strong><em>Fatherhood Network Scotland </em><br><strong>Olivia Bailey</strong><em> Chair, Labour Women\u2019s Network </em><br><strong>Lee Chalmers</strong><em> The Parliament Project</em><br><strong>Laura Christer</strong><em> Westend Women and Girls</em><br><strong>Helen Pankhurst</strong><em> The Centenary Action Group</em><br><strong>Shereen Fisher</strong><em> Chief executive, The Breastfeeding Network</em><br><strong>Catherine Anderson</strong><em> Jo Cox Foundation</em><br><strong>Fenella Dawnay</strong><em> Artichoke </em><br><strong>Dr Shola Mos-Shogbamimu</strong><em> Lawyer and women\u2019s rights activist</em><br><strong>Emma Ritch</strong><em> Engender</em><br><strong>Helene Reardon Bond OBE</strong><br><strong>Amelia Womack</strong><em> The Green party </em><br><strong>Dr Tessa Chynoweth</strong><em> The Pankhurst Trust </em><br><strong>Flo Clucas</strong><em> Chair, Liberal Democrat Women</em><br><strong>Ella Robertson</strong><em> Conservative Young Women</em><br><strong>Binita Mehta-Palmer</strong><em> Modern Britain </em><br><strong>Patrick Sullivan</strong><em> Parliament Street</em><br><strong>Cerys Furlong</strong><em> Chwarae Teg</em></p> <p><em><strong>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email <a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">guardian.letters@theguardian.com</a></strong></em></p> <p><em><strong>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\">gu.com/letters</a></strong></em></p> <p><em><strong>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/15/share-your-best-photographs-of-the-week-with-us\" title=\"\">Click here</a> to upload it and we\u2019ll publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition</strong></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "We write as an alliance of charities and campaigners to express our support for the development of a transparent procedure and budget that would allow all MPs to have access to six months\u2019 parental and adoption leave. We therefore call on the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) to take the lead on this matter and consult on bringing in new measures without delay. There has been cross-party support for this campaign, including support from Theresa May, Jeremy Hunt, Anna Soubry, Sajid Javid, Jo Swinson, Caroline Lucas and Valerie Vaz. We believe the current process discriminates against women and acts as a deterrent to gender equality within Westminster. We also believe it sends a negative signal about how pregnant women and new mothers should be treated when they are working. With 54,000 women a year being pushed out of their jobs due to pregnancy and maternity discrimination it is important that Westminster sets the gold standard in how it treats new mothers. This change in policy is important for MPs and the diversity of the parliamentary workforce, but it is also important for all UK citizens; firstly because we need to know that constituents will be in receipt of proper representation but also because, by legislating for parental leave for MPs, the government will send a strong signal to employers that parents who work are valued.

The assertion that the attitudes of 50 years ago fostered \u201cself-reliance\u201d, \u201cgetting on with life\u201d, \u201cnot becoming too self-absorbed\u201d and \u201cnot taking ourselves too seriously\u201d made me sigh. Despite advocating a nuanced view of history, Mr Massey seems unable to take a similar view of the present. My course of high-intensity cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) on the NHS has provided me with space to laugh at my irrationality, to get on with life, and to become more empathic of others. I was only obsessing over my mental ill health when it wasn\u2019t being treated. Joshua Martin Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands \u2022 I am of the generation that was brought up to value self-reliance, get on with life, not become too self-absorbed, not take myself too seriously and not impose demands on a finite healthcare system out of recognition that there are others whose needs are greater. Two years ago I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety after I could not stop weeping uncontrollably (the stiff upper lip didn\u2019t work). Increased awareness of mental illness has meant I can talk openly about my own situation, so that friends and neighbours can offer support, understanding what has happened to me, and my wife\u2019s cousin can call me the family nut job and mean it affectionately. There will always be a need for people like me to seek and receive the mental health care and support I needed, and still need, from professionals and those around me, to recover from what was, for me, a life-changing downward spiral into mental ill health.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/05/abortion-doctors-fetal-heartbeat-bills-language-misleading\">has made this clear</a>; there is no detectable heartbeat at six weeks.</p> \n<p>\u201cAdding the words \u2018so-called\u2019 or placing the phrase in parentheses will not address this bias; only a commitment to its removal from BBC coverage of abortion from now on can restore the balance the corporation rightly demands and expects of itself.\u201d</p> \n<p>The BBC\u2019s director of news and current affairs, Fran Unsworth, said in response: \u201cWe would not aim to adopt it as our own description of the legislation \u2026 I\u2019m afraid that I disagree with you when you suggest that we should cease using the expression entirely.</p> \n<p>\u201cI do not think our reporting can avoid the fact that the phrase is now in common usage. We will continue to place \u2018heartbeat bill\u2019 in quotation marks or to attribute it, but our overall aim will always be to try to explain the precise nature of the bill, rather than rely on shorthand coined by others.\u201d</p> \n<p>The director general of the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), Dr Alvaro Bermejo, urged the BBC to \u201cthink again\u201d. He said the BBC could not \u201cconcede \u2018heartbeat bill\u2019 is a biased and medically inaccurate description and then say it\u2019s going to use it anyway\u201d.</p> \n<p>Bermejo said: \u201cSaying it is \u2018in common usage\u2019 is no excuse, especially when the BBC \u2026 shares the blame for spreading it.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3a579405-990c-43af-96a1-3c6f43d37396\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Which states have enacted the strictest abortion bans?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Missouri\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/28/missouri-abortion-clinic-closure-first-state-roe-v-wade\">move</a> to close its last <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/abortion\">abortion</a> clinic, after already outlawing the procedure past eight weeks, and the near total abortion ban in Alabama have put the states passing the most restrictive laws under the spotlight.</p>\n    <p>Abortion in the United States remains legal in all 50 states. The new laws recently passed in a number of states have not yet come into force and may never do so, being subject to court challenges from pro-choice entities.</p>\n    <p>State laws that ban abortion eight weeks into a pregnancy or sooner are unconstitutional.</p>\n    <p>They go against the 1973 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/roe-v-wade\">Roe v Wade</a> ruling from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/us-supreme-court\">US supreme court</a> that triggered the legalization of abortion nationwide. Anti-abortion campaigners hope court challenges will ultimately prompt the now-conservative leaning court to reconsider the ruling.</p>\n    <p>The Roe landmark bestowed the right of a woman to seek an abortion up to the point of fetal viability outside the womb, which is widely considered to be between 24 and 28 weeks. In reality, some states have already made obtaining an abortion almost impossible for many, by chipping away at women\u2019s rights and services in a sustained legal and religious crusade in recent decades.</p>\n    <p>These are the states that have passed the most restrictive laws in 2019, and two earlier vanguards:</p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Alabama</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alabama\">Alabama</a>\u2019s Republican-<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/14/alabama-abortion-ban-white-men-republicans\">controlled</a> state senate in mid-May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/14/abortion-bill-alabama-passes-ban-six-weeks-us-no-exemptions-vote-latest\">passed</a> a near-total ban on abortion, making it a crime to perform the procedure \u2013 at any stage of pregnancy. The ban is the strictest in the US, and allows an exception only when the woman\u2019s health is deemed to be at serious risk. The measure contains no exception for rape or incest, and the state governor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2019/may/15/alabama-abortion-ban-bill-live-trump-news-today-protests-us-politics-latest-updates\">signed</a> it into law days later, before a court challenge by Planned Parenthood.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Ohio</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Stringent restrictions were passed in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ohio\">Ohio</a> in April, banning the procedure after detection of embryonic cardiac activity, ie at around six weeks, when many don\u2019t yet know they\u2019re pregnant.</p>\n    <p>Known as \"fetal heartbeat\" legislation, the title is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/24/its-not-a-little-child-gynecologists-join-the-fight-against-six-week-abortion-bans\">mischaracterization</a>. At this early stage a woman is carrying an embryo with a throbbing cell cluster, that\u2019s not yet termed a fetus with a recognizable heart.</p>\n    <p>Republican governor Mike DeWine broke with his predecessor to sign the law, a long-sought victory for extremist activists such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/25/the-anti-abortion-crusader-hopes-her-heartbeat-law-will-test-roe-v-wade\">Janet Porter</a>.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Kentucky</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kentucky\">Kentucky</a> also <a href=\"https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/ky-legislature/2019/03/13/abortion-bills-headed-final-action-kentucky-house/3151914002/\">passed</a> a six-week ban, in March, which governor Matt Bevin signed, capping off a session that saw several pieces of anti-abortion legislation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/11/abortion-judge-strikes-down-kentucky-restriction-but-governor-to-appeal\">passed</a> in the state, only to be met by lawsuits.</p>\n    <p>As in several other states, the bill was accompanied by impassioned and sometimes angry arguments from both sides, and faced immediate legal challenges, in this case from the ACLU, which described it as \u201cblatantly unconstitutional\u201d.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Mississippi</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Governor Phil Bryant signed a similar bill into law in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mississippi\">Mississippi</a>, amid ceremony at the capitol, also in March and again <a href=\"https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/21/mississippi-abortion-heartbeat-ban-phil-bryant-law/3232408002/\">banning</a> abortion effectively after six weeks.</p>\n    <p>Saying the legislation showed \u201cthe profound respect and desire of Mississippians to protect the sanctity of that unborn life whenever possible\u201d and was for the sake of \u201cthe physical and mental health of the mother\u201d, Bryant walked into a prompt court challenge.</p>\n    <p>It gave no exceptions for rape or incest, and doctors performing abortion faced suspension of their license.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Georgia</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/state-of-georgia\">Georgia</a> passed its version of the six-week ban in May, it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/07/georgia-governor-signs-bill-to-ban-abortion-after-six-weeks\">capped</a> weeks of protests in Atlanta and sparked yet another court battle.</p>\n    <p>Governor Brian Kemp said he was signing the bill \u201cto ensure that all Georgians have the opportunity to live, grow, learn and prosper in our great state\u201d.</p>\n    <p>In a challenge, Sean Young, legal director of the ACLU of Georgia, said: \u201cEvery federal court that has heard a challenge to a similar ban has ruled that it\u2019s unconstitutional.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Louisiana</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Protesters may have dressed up as handmaids, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/louisiana\">Louisiana</a> still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/29/louisiana-abortion-ban-passes-house\">overwhelmingly</a> enshrined the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/24/its-not-a-little-child-gynecologists-join-the-fight-against-six-week-abortion-bans\">misnamed</a> \u201cfetal heartbeat\u201d bill in late May. It\u2019s expected to be signed by governor John Bel Edwards, even as the only governor in the deep south who\u2019s a Democrat, despite opposition at national party level.</p>\n    <p>Abortion has been prohibitively difficult in the state for decades. Louisiana already has more than 1,000 medically unnecessary requirements regarding the procedure, <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/issues/reproductive-freedom/abortion/last-clinics-standing\">according to the ACLU</a>, and just three clinics left.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Missouri</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Days before the state moved in late May to shut down its last abortion clinic, which would make it the only state without one, Missouri had already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/17/missouri-lawmakers-approve-bill-to-ban-abortions-after-eight-weeks-of-pregnancy\">passed</a> an eight-week abortion ban for the state.</p>\n    <p>The legislation includes an exception for medical emergencies threatening a woman\u2019s health, but not for rape or incest.

      "bodyText": "An international alliance of medical experts has accused the BBC of using \u201cmedically inaccurate\u201d and biased \u201cdangerously emotive\u201d language after the corporation refused to stop describing US legislation seeking to ban access in some states to legal abortions after six weeks as a \u201cheartbeat bill\u201d. The phrase helps \u201cweaponise\u201d descriptions of abortions, claim a group of family planning specialists that includes Marie Stopes International, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics. They wrote recently to the corporation to request it stop using the term, claiming it is \u201cat odds\u201d with the BBC\u2019s editorial standards and royal charter that \u201crequire the corporation to treat subjects with \u2018due impartiality\u2019\u201d. The alliance\u2019s letter, seen by the Guardian, said: \u201cAnti-abortionists coined the phrase in a clear attempt to frame the debate on their own emotional and empathetic terms. \u201cAs an international broadcaster with a global weekly reach in 2018 of 376 million people, [the BBC] \u2026 has a duty to avoid being complicit, however unknowingly, in the aggressive campaign by anti-abortion extremists worldwide attempting to rob women of their rights and care.\u201d It also said the term \u201cheartbeat bill\u201d was \u201cmedically inaccurate. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has made this clear; there is no detectable heartbeat at six weeks. \u201cAdding the words \u2018so-called\u2019 or placing the phrase in parentheses will not address this bias; only a commitment to its removal from BBC coverage of abortion from now on can restore the balance the corporation rightly demands and expects of itself.\u201d The BBC\u2019s director of news and current affairs, Fran Unsworth, said in response: \u201cWe would not aim to adopt it as our own description of the legislation \u2026 I\u2019m afraid that I disagree with you when you suggest that we should cease using the expression entirely. \u201cI do not think our reporting can avoid the fact that the phrase is now in common usage. We will continue to place \u2018heartbeat bill\u2019 in quotation marks or to attribute it, but our overall aim will always be to try to explain the precise nature of the bill, rather than rely on shorthand coined by others.\u201d The director general of the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), Dr Alvaro Bermejo, urged the BBC to \u201cthink again\u201d. He said the BBC could not \u201cconcede \u2018heartbeat bill\u2019 is a biased and medically inaccurate description and then say it\u2019s going to use it anyway\u201d. Bermejo said: \u201cSaying it is \u2018in common usage\u2019 is no excuse, especially when the BBC \u2026 shares the blame for spreading it.\u201d The IPPF pointed out that others, including the Guardian, had announced they would avoid using the phrase. Bermejo added: \u201cLanguage around legal abortion has been weaponised by those who want to deny women access to it and journalists \u2013 especially those who work for a news organisation which claims to be impartial and trusted \u2013 must wake up and see they are being played. \u201cThis phrase was chosen very carefully by people who want to end access to legal abortion and who are exploiting the mainstream media to insert dangerously emotive language into the common vernacular.

      "body": "<p>The publisher and editor Cecil Woolf, who has died aged 92, was a nephew of Virginia and Leonard Woolf and the last person to have known Virginia Woolf personally, taking her tea in bed as a little boy. From his house in Mornington Crescent, north London, he ran a small publishing company, Cecil Woolf Publishers, producing books including the Bloomsbury Heritage Series, a collection of monographs exploring all aspects of Virginia Woolf and her fabled circle.</p> <p>A kind, charming and erudite man, in later years he spoke regularly at Woolf conferences and extended the hand of friendship to young scholars and writers, inviting them into the home he shared with his wife, the biographer and critic Jean Moorcroft Wilson, where art by Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant adorned the walls and dinner was served on the table on which Virginia and Leonard Woolf had run the Hogarth Press. </p> <p>Cecil was the son of Philip Woolf (the youngest brother of Leonard) and his wife, Barbara (nee Lownds), and was born and brought up in Buckinghamshire on the Waddesdon estate, home of the Liberal politician James de Rothschild, where Philip was estate manager. He had two sisters, Philippa and Marie.</p> <p>Educated at Stowe school, Buckinghamshire, and clearly a bright student who at another time would have gone on to university, he instead enlisted in the army, joining the tank regiment as a private and fighting in Italy. He returned in 1947 as a captain, fluent in Italian, and had a brief career in the City at Woolf, Christie, his uncles\u2019 stockbroking firm. His sights set on publishing, he left to become an antiquarian bookseller.</p> <p>It was a trade to which Woolf was no stranger, having worked with Leonard at the Hogarth Press (he also shared Leonard\u2019s London house for nearly a decade), and in 1960 he set up his own imprint. The first in the Bloomsbury Heritage Series appeared in 1994 \u2013 Virginia Woolf\u2019s previously unpublished juvenile \u201cnovel\u201d A Cockney\u2019s Farming Experiences \u2013 and this was followed by more than 80 further volumes about Woolf and the Bloomsbury Group, a rich resource for scholars and general readers alike.</p> <p>He also published an extensive list of first world war poets, as well as his own writings \u2013 including, in 2017, a short memoir, The Other Boy at the Hogarth Press: Virginia and Leonard Woolf As I Remember Them. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"995ff3b77f2d42ba3ad0675cce19aa32909f1cff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/995ff3b77f2d42ba3ad0675cce19aa32909f1cff/11_314_2629_1577/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Virginia and Leonard Woolf.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Virginia and Leonard Woolf. Cecil Woolf was 14 when she died and in his later years spoke regularly at Woolf conferences.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The list\u2019s liveliness owes much to the efforts of Moorcroft Wilson, who shared Woolf\u2019s life and work from 1972. They met in the reading room at the British Museum, a chance encounter when she was working on her PhD thesis on the forgotten war poet William Watson, about whom Cecil had written. He told her he preferred DH Lawrence to Virginia Woolf but the relationship survived and the couple married in 1981, after the birth of four of their five children.</p> <p>Her doctorate complete, Moorcroft Wilson began a career in academia \u2013 first in Munich, later at Birkbeck in London \u2013 and at Woolf\u2019s suggestion added to the CWP War Poets series with volumes on Isaac Rosenberg and Charles Hamilton Sorley. While she personally moved to larger publishers (\u201che forgave me\u201d) the couple worked creatively on a variety of titles.</p> <p>A series of Authors Take Sides was inspired by Nancy Cunard\u2019s pamphlet on the Spanish civil war, and included a volume of writings on the Gulf and Iraq wars (2004). The Falklands provided fertile ground, with two books on the sinking of the Belgrano: Tam Dalyell\u2019s Thatcher\u2019s Torpedo (1983) and On The Spot (1984), by Diane Gould, the schoolteacher whose interrogation of Margaret Thatcher on the current affairs TV programme Nationwide so discommoded the prime minister. Death of a Rose-Grower (1985), by Graham Smith, about the murder of the anti-nuclear campaigner Hilda Murrell, was another topical bestseller. </p> <p>Moorcroft Wilson reflected on the decades-long collaboration with her husband: \u201cWe had an extraordinarily good working relationship \u2026 My great wish is that Cecil Woolf Publishers continue, and I have every intention of doing my utmost to ensure it does, either with me or our children, or with someone else who shares the same values and ideals.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/11/letter-cecil-woolf-obituary\">Letter: Cecil Woolf was generous and sociable</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As to Virginia Woolf, Cecil took real pride in the relationship, attending many conferences, where he spoke of early memories of staying with the Woolfs at Monk\u2019s House, Rodmell, near Lewes, or later at Tavistock Square in Bloomsbury, overcoming his natural diffidence as his wife dealt with \u201ccircles of adoring women\u201d. But he had a hard time dealing with those who blamed Leonard for Virginia\u2019s death, insisting \u201che saved her time and again, sitting there feeding her spoonful by spoonful because as she got thinner and thinner, she\u2019d get depressed\u201d.</p> <p>Woolf remembered his aunt as \u201camusing, funny \u2013 a very motherly sort of person\u201d, and his last sight of her was up a tree picking apples. He was 14 and at school when she died; the English master, G Wilson Knight, a colleague of Quentin Bell, told him of \u201cVirginia\u2019s last walk to the Ouse\u201d.</p> <p>Woolf was an \u201camazingly approachable gem of a man\u201d, according to the writer Paula Maggio, who was introduced to him as a postgraduate at a conference in 2007. She found in him a mentor and a friend, and went on to contribute five volumes on Woolf for the Bloomsbury Heritage Series.</p> <p>He was patient with the authors he published, working painstakingly as an editor to ensure their book was the best it could be. Drew Shannon, another scholar who became a good friend, described Woolf as \u201cour link to a past that we all long to connect to, and such a force of nature in our present\u201d.</p> <p>His first marriage, to the Italian actress Malya Nappi, ended in divorce. He is survived by Jean and their children, Kate, Philip, Emma, Alice and Trim.</p> <p>\u2022 Cecil James Sydney Woolf, publisher, born 20 February 1927; died 10 June 2019</p>",

It was a trade to which Woolf was no stranger, having worked with Leonard at the Hogarth Press (he also shared Leonard\u2019s London house for nearly a decade), and in 1960 he set up his own imprint. The first in the Bloomsbury Heritage Series appeared in 1994 \u2013 Virginia Woolf\u2019s previously unpublished juvenile \u201cnovel\u201d A Cockney\u2019s Farming Experiences \u2013 and this was followed by more than 80 further volumes about Woolf and the Bloomsbury Group, a rich resource for scholars and general readers alike. He also published an extensive list of first world war poets, as well as his own writings \u2013 including, in 2017, a short memoir, The Other Boy at the Hogarth Press: Virginia and Leonard Woolf As I Remember Them. The list\u2019s liveliness owes much to the efforts of Moorcroft Wilson, who shared Woolf\u2019s life and work from 1972. They met in the reading room at the British Museum, a chance encounter when she was working on her PhD thesis on the forgotten war poet William Watson, about whom Cecil had written. He told her he preferred DH Lawrence to Virginia Woolf but the relationship survived and the couple married in 1981, after the birth of four of their five children. Her doctorate complete, Moorcroft Wilson began a career in academia \u2013 first in Munich, later at Birkbeck in London \u2013 and at Woolf\u2019s suggestion added to the CWP War Poets series with volumes on Isaac Rosenberg and Charles Hamilton Sorley. While she personally moved to larger publishers (\u201che forgave me\u201d) the couple worked creatively on a variety of titles. A series of Authors Take Sides was inspired by Nancy Cunard\u2019s pamphlet on the Spanish civil war, and included a volume of writings on the Gulf and Iraq wars (2004). The Falklands provided fertile ground, with two books on the sinking of the Belgrano: Tam Dalyell\u2019s Thatcher\u2019s Torpedo (1983) and On The Spot (1984), by Diane Gould, the schoolteacher whose interrogation of Margaret Thatcher on the current affairs TV programme Nationwide so discommoded the prime minister. Death of a Rose-Grower (1985), by Graham Smith, about the murder of the anti-nuclear campaigner Hilda Murrell, was another topical bestseller. Moorcroft Wilson reflected on the decades-long collaboration with her husband: \u201cWe had an extraordinarily good working relationship \u2026 My great wish is that Cecil Woolf Publishers continue, and I have every intention of doing my utmost to ensure it does, either with me or our children, or with someone else who shares the same values and ideals.\u201d As to Virginia Woolf, Cecil took real pride in the relationship, attending many conferences, where he spoke of early memories of staying with the Woolfs at Monk\u2019s House, Rodmell, near Lewes, or later at Tavistock Square in Bloomsbury, overcoming his natural diffidence as his wife dealt with \u201ccircles of adoring women\u201d. But he had a hard time dealing with those who blamed Leonard for Virginia\u2019s death, insisting \u201che saved her time and again, sitting there feeding her spoonful by spoonful because as she got thinner and thinner, she\u2019d get depressed\u201d. Woolf remembered his aunt as \u201camusing, funny \u2013 a very motherly sort of person\u201d, and his last sight of her was up a tree picking apples. He was 14 and at school when she died; the English master, G Wilson Knight, a colleague of Quentin Bell, told him of \u201cVirginia\u2019s last walk to the Ouse\u201d. Woolf was an \u201camazingly approachable gem of a man\u201d, according to the writer Paula Maggio, who was introduced to him as a postgraduate at a conference in 2007. She found in him a mentor and a friend, and went on to contribute five volumes on Woolf for the Bloomsbury Heritage Series. He was patient with the authors he published, working painstakingly as an editor to ensure their book was the best it could be. Drew Shannon, another scholar who became a good friend, described Woolf as \u201cour link to a past that we all long to connect to, and such a force of nature in our present\u201d. His first marriage, to the Italian actress Malya Nappi, ended in divorce. He is survived by Jean and their children, Kate, Philip, Emma, Alice and Trim. \u2022 Cecil James Sydney Woolf, publisher, born 20 February 1927; died 10 June 2019",

Fifty years after the first broadcast of Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus, the men who revolutionised comedy have revealed details of events to mark their anniversary in what they dubbed \u201can increasingly Pythonesque world\u201d. \u201cExtreme silliness seems more relevant now than it ever was,\u201d the surviving five Pythons added in a statement that also revealed plans by BBC Radio 4 to air new radio specials. The troupe\u2019s legions of fans of all generations can also look forward to what has been billed as the \u201cfirst official Monty Python Guinness world record attempt\u201d, which will take place on the anniversary date itself, 5 October.

A statement issued on behalf of the group said that a \u201cBBC takeover\u201d in September would feature previously unreleased material from the Monty Python sound archives. Listeners are being invited to find out the extra unpleasant things that were planned for Idle\u2019s Brave Sir Robin character, a cowardly knight whose minstrels sing about the terrible fates that await him in the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail. A return is also on the cards for other characters, namely the Fat Ignorant Bastards, who \u201chave never been more relevant to the world today\u201d, according to the group. Meanwhile on television, BBC Two will celebrate Monty Python with \u201cdefining career pieces\u201d from the archives. The anniversary celebrations begin on 1 September at the BFI Southbank, London, which will curate a month-long season celebrating the Pythons\u2019 influences and subsequent work both as a group and as individuals.

He stressed they should make it easier for parents to exercise control over what their children can see online and that child-safe modes should be the default setting in many cases. The culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, also expressed commitment to implementing the online harms white paper and vowed to create a regulator that would impose sanctions on tech companies failing to abide by a code of practice. These sanctions would include fines, he said, but also place responsibility on company directors and potentially lead to sites being blocked. \u201cWe expect, we deserve and we will require that some of the cleverest companies in the world use their ingenuity to protect us, as well as to sell to us,\u201d he said. He added that guidelines for websites and apps on how to safeguard children from inappropriate content would be published in the autumn. Jim Gamble, a former chief executive of the National Crime Agency\u2019s child exploitation and online protection division, said the government had been too quick to blame tech companies. He said child vulnerability and mental health issues were the root causes that needed to be tackled, and these problems had been exacerbated by Conservative austerity measures. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to point the finger of blame and I think we do it too frequently at industry, perhaps not frequently enough at parents, but definitely we do not point the finger of blame where it belongs at government often enough,\u201d Gamble said.

A funding green paper, promised more than 18 months ago, has been postponed six times.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/18/care-services-reliant-unpaid-volunteers\">Care services shouldn\u2019t rely on volunteers\u2019 goodwill.

Many get great care and support to live good lives and die good deaths. Too many struggle without help though. Too many struggle without enough help,\u201d Ogley writes in an introduction to the Adass survey.</p> <p>Adass contrasted the pessimism of this year\u2019s survey with signs of optimism it detected <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/12/adult-social-care-services-collapse-survey-england-council\">12 months ago</a> that a funding settlement for social care was within reach. \u201cThis has not happened and instead the problems councils and providers face have got progressively worse,\u201d it said.</p> <p>The crisis was compounded by uncompetitive wages and poor working conditions leaving councils unable to recruit and retain good-quality staff. More than 100,000 of the 1.4 million care workforce come from the EU, and Adass warned that after Brexit it would be harder to recruit EU nationals.</p> <p>Since 2010, \u00a37.7bn had been cut from adult social care budgets in England, Adass said. A further \u00a3700m of cuts are planned for 2019-20, but two-thirds of directors were not wholly confident they can be delivered. There were similar levels of scepticism that councils had sufficient resources to meet legal minimum levels of service.</p> <p>On average councils will devote 38p of every pound they spend overall on adult social care this year \u2013 up from 34p in the pound in 2010. Despite this investment, however, more than a third of authorities overspent their adult social care budget last year. Half of those financed the overspend by cutting non-care council services.</p> <p>More than a third of councils said the impact of cuts meant access to social care was restricted to fewer people, while just under a third of councils said cuts meant people were getting smaller personal care budgets. Nearly a fifth of councils surveyed admitted the quality of life for people using care had got worse.</p> <p>Earlier this year Age UK said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/06/age-uk-50000-elderly-have-died-waiting-for-social-care-package\">tightening eligibility </a>for council-funded social care meant 627,000 people \u2013 nearly 900 a day \u2013 had been refused social care since March 2017. More than 1.4 million older people aged 65 and over had unmet care needs, it estimated.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government\u2019s failure to get to grips with the escalating financial crisis in social care has put tens of thousands of older and disabled people at risk of being denied basic support such as help with washing and dressing, care chiefs have warned. Without urgent guarantees over funding levels there was a serious risk that local authorities would be forced to start decommissioning care services in the autumn, they said. \u201cThis situation has a very real and damaging effect on the day-to-day lives of people who need and provide care,\u201d said the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services in its annual survey. In a withering assessment, Adass said social care in England was adrift in a \u201csea of inertia\u201d caused by years of budget cuts and Brexit-related Whitehall policy paralysis. \u201cThe system is not only failing financially, it is failing people,\u201d it concluded. There were already signs that some fragile local care markets were imploding under the strain \u2013 almost half of councils had witnessed the closure of domestic home care providers in their area in the past year, and a third had seen residential care homes shut down, collectively affecting more than 8,000 clients and residents. Although the care crisis has emerged as a topic in the Conservative party leadership debates \u2013 the former health and social care secretary Jeremy Hunt admitted the cuts have gone too far \u2013 this is seen of no practical help for councils unsure of funding levels beyond the next few months. The frank warning from council care chiefs reflects deep frustration at the government\u2019s repeated neglect of promises to come up with a solution to the challenge of how to pay for growing adult social care needs. A funding green paper, promised more than 18 months ago, has been postponed six times. Adass called for urgent cross-party agreement to tackle what it called the most pressing domestic issue of our time. \u201cOur message from this survey to the new prime minister, whoever this may be, is very clear: make social care an immediate priority,\u201d said the Adass president, Julie Ogley. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson responded by promising that the funding of social care would be considered alongside the rest of local government services at the forthcoming spending review. \u201cWe will set out our plans to reform the social care system at the earliest opportunity to ensure it is sustainable for the future.\u201d At local authority level there is cross-party political concern that the strains on social care budgets will lead to more unpopular rationing of state-funded care services, as shown on a recent fly-on-the-wall BBC documentary that captured the traumatic impact on families of care cuts at Somerset county council. \u201cBehind these numbers are the stories of thousands and thousands of older and disabled people and their families. Many get great care and support to live good lives and die good deaths. Too many struggle without help though. Too many struggle without enough help,\u201d Ogley writes in an introduction to the Adass survey. Adass contrasted the pessimism of this year\u2019s survey with signs of optimism it detected 12 months ago that a funding settlement for social care was within reach. \u201cThis has not happened and instead the problems councils and providers face have got progressively worse,\u201d it said. The crisis was compounded by uncompetitive wages and poor working conditions leaving councils unable to recruit and retain good-quality staff. More than 100,000 of the 1.4 million care workforce come from the EU, and Adass warned that after Brexit it would be harder to recruit EU nationals. Since 2010, \u00a37.7bn had been cut from adult social care budgets in England, Adass said. A further \u00a3700m of cuts are planned for 2019-20, but two-thirds of directors were not wholly confident they can be delivered. There were similar levels of scepticism that councils had sufficient resources to meet legal minimum levels of service. On average councils will devote 38p of every pound they spend overall on adult social care this year \u2013 up from 34p in the pound in 2010. Despite this investment, however, more than a third of authorities overspent their adult social care budget last year. Half of those financed the overspend by cutting non-care council services. More than a third of councils said the impact of cuts meant access to social care was restricted to fewer people, while just under a third of councils said cuts meant people were getting smaller personal care budgets. Nearly a fifth of councils surveyed admitted the quality of life for people using care had got worse. Earlier this year Age UK said tightening eligibility for council-funded social care meant 627,000 people \u2013 nearly 900 a day \u2013 had been refused social care since March 2017. More than 1.4 million older people aged 65 and over had unmet care needs, it estimated.",

We know who has the upper hand here.\u201d</p> \n<p>Numbers of Mexican law enforcement officers have been increasing in recent days as Donald Trump demands that Mexico crack down on migrants before they attempt to cross the border. More than 200 Mexican federal police officers arrived in Piedras Negras on Saturday, reinforcing Mexican national guard soldiers and immigration agents already there. They guard the river and check people\u2019s papers day and night.</p> \n<p>On Sunday morning, a family of eight migrants from El Salvador arrived at the migrant shelter run by Catholic nuns in Piedras Negras. The S\u00e1nchez Reyes family of three adults and five children said they ran a bakery in San Salvador.

We want to find work here,\u201d the matriarch, Flor S\u00e1nchez Reyes, said.</p> \n<p>But those words may have been a decoy. Later that day, the S\u00e1nchez Reyes family slipped away from the shelter to \u201cgo for a walk and bathe in the river\u201d after their six-hour bus ride from the Mexican interior, they told the Guardian by text message.

You would be surprised at how fast they can run.

I grew up here along the R\u00edo Bravo river [R\u00edo Grande]. I wouldn\u2019t even go into that water to bathe or swim. There are springs and whirlpools and when the current takes you it can pull you under and you don\u2019t resurface.

The family had said they were going to stay for two days at the migrant shelter in Piedras Negras but instead disappeared late on Sunday afternoon. After several hours of not responding to messages, they got in touch, saying they had made it safely across the river to Eagle Pass.</p> \n<p>\u201cNobody even stopped us as we got into the river. We changed out of our wet clothes and waited for ages on the riverbank. We wanted to turn ourselves in to border patrol,\u201d Diaz said. \u201cBut the van never showed up so we decided to walk into Eagle Pass.\u201d</p> \n<p>They found a motel and threw themselves on the mercy of its owner, who said they could pay for a night\u2019s stay in Mexican pesos.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are trying to figure out what to do,\u201d D\u00edaz said. \u201cDo we turn ourselves in or try to keep going? We don\u2019t have any money and so it\u2019s going to be difficult to get out of Eagle Pass. Soon we\u2019ll have to make a decision. I think we should turn ourselves in to border patrol.\u201d It was hard to discern from WhatsApp messages whether the family was hopeful or frightened.</p> \n<p>Back in Piedras Negras, there are simple wooden crosses in the municipal cemetery, marking paupers\u2019 graves where unidentified migrants who drowned on the Mexican side of the river this year were taken to be buried.</p> \n<p>Like the father and daughter photographed face down in the Rio Grande a few miles east, it is not possible to know exactly what terrors and prayers crossed their minds in their last seconds, but it is all too easy to imagine.</p>",

It happens all the time.\u201d Meanwhile, \u00c1ngel D\u00edaz, a migrant from Nicaragua, crossed the river with six family members, including his newborn daughter, around dusk on Sunday. The family had said they were going to stay for two days at the migrant shelter in Piedras Negras but instead disappeared late on Sunday afternoon. After several hours of not responding to messages, they got in touch, saying they had made it safely across the river to Eagle Pass. \u201cNobody even stopped us as we got into the river. We changed out of our wet clothes and waited for ages on the riverbank. We wanted to turn ourselves in to border patrol,\u201d Diaz said. \u201cBut the van never showed up so we decided to walk into Eagle Pass.\u201d They found a motel and threw themselves on the mercy of its owner, who said they could pay for a night\u2019s stay in Mexican pesos. \u201cWe are trying to figure out what to do,\u201d D\u00edaz said. \u201cDo we turn ourselves in or try to keep going? We don\u2019t have any money and so it\u2019s going to be difficult to get out of Eagle Pass. Soon we\u2019ll have to make a decision. I think we should turn ourselves in to border patrol.\u201d It was hard to discern from WhatsApp messages whether the family was hopeful or frightened. Back in Piedras Negras, there are simple wooden crosses in the municipal cemetery, marking paupers\u2019 graves where unidentified migrants who drowned on the Mexican side of the river this year were taken to be buried. Like the father and daughter photographed face down in the Rio Grande a few miles east, it is not possible to know exactly what terrors and prayers crossed their minds in their last seconds, but it is all too easy to imagine.",

      "bodyText": "The troubled Caledonian Sleeper has suffered a fresh setback, with new trains on its Highlands service now unlikely to appear until after the summer holiday season. The flagship overnight train, billed as a hotel on wheels, has been plagued by problems on the lowland route between London, Edinburgh and Glasgow since the introduction of a new \u00a3150m fleet. The sleeper operator, Serco, said further new Spanish-built carriages from the manufacturer CAF would be used to supplement the lowland service rather than launch on the scenic Highlands routes to Fort William and Inverness. The upgraded trains, featuring double beds and ensuite bathrooms and partly funded by the Scottish government, should appear in the Highlands in September. Customers who booked for 7 July onwards can either get a full refund or the fare difference for the existing, 30-year-old rolling stock. Passengers were promised a luxury experience, paying from \u00a3400 for a double ensuite, but reality has fallen short for many travellers. On a disastrous first night in April both north and southbound trains rolled in hours late. The delay was due to signalling problems, but compounded by the sleeper\u2019s onboard problems, with customers booked into the wrong cabins and the vaunted catering going awry. Technical faults with the trains have led to a number of overnight services being cancelled or curtailed, leaving passengers stranded until morning. Punctuality is the worst of any UK train operator: last month, official figures showed only three in five trains ran from London to Edinburgh on time. Ryan Flaherty, Serco\u2019s managing director at Caledonian Sleeper, said: \u201cWe are disappointed to be announcing this further delay but it is undoubtedly the correct decision and will allow us to improve the reliability and resilience of the lowlander fleet and maintain capacity on the Highland route. \u201cOur priority must be delivering a reliable service on the lowland route and then make sure that each new carriage on the Highland route is ready to welcome guests and deliver a true Caledonian Sleeper experience.\u201d Transport Scotland said the latest delay was \u201csimply unacceptable\u201d but blamed the manufacturer for failing to supply enough trains in time. Staff have reported being at \u201cbreaking point\u201d through stress since the new fleet arrived, according to unions. RMT threatened strike action, adding that onboard crew stuck on delayed trains with disgruntled customers were \u201cunable to see how they are ever going to have anything like a good work-life balance again\u201d.",

He is disturbed to discover the status of the site.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b7d67c7e-011f-46d5-9a2c-db04eb6077a7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aw7GeveegPI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI was expecting a nursing home with 70 beds, so I\u2019m really shocked to see that nothing has happened,\u201d he said earlier this month. \u201cIf my wife was here, she would start to cry. I\u2019m really upset but what else can I do?</p> \n<p>\u201c[I\u2019m] devastated and really disgusted; more so because my wife is so upset. She is in a position where she has to carry on working.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe were banking on [the interest payment] for our future. It is our real lifetime savings and pension for us. Because of this both of us have to rethink our plans and carry on working.\u201d</p> \n<p>Devadoss is not the only investor in Woodhouse\u2019s care home projects who is concerned about what might happen to their savings. Earlier this year Woodhouse wrote to investors admitting to cashflow problems and telling them he would be rescheduling their dividends.</p> \n<p>Another investor, who did not want to be named but put about \u00a340,000 into the Walsden care home project in West Yorkshire in 2014, said: \u201cWhen my dad died, he said to me: \u2018Put the money that you will get from the house into property.\u2019 So we followed his advice. We thought this [project] is really good, it fits in with the amount we can afford and it\u2019s a really worthwhile thing because we like to be altruistic and help other people through life.\u201d</p> \n<p>Annual scheduled dividends have been delayed in each year of the investment and only received after sustained chasing. It has left the investor worried if they will ever see their money again.</p> \n<p>\u201cI wish I\u2019d never seen [this investment] \u2026 There are so many people who have put much more than we have into it and my heart bleeds for them. I really don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll get the money at all. There was my dad giving what he thought was sensible advice and I sort of let him down. It\u2019s quite upsetting really. I feel I\u2019ve been taken for a mug, as so many people have.\u201d</p> \n<p>In Burnley at Hawthorn, the third unbuilt care home for which Woodhouse raised funds, another investor who did not want to be identified has been trying to confirm that his money is safe for almost a year.</p> \n<p>Communications with NPD\u2019s sales agents had left him with the firm impression that the funds raised to build Hawthorn were being safeguarded by Woodhouse\u2019s solicitor, Metis Law. But repeated efforts to obtain proof the money was safe were frustrated over many months.</p> \n<p>\u201cAll I\u2019m asking for is that they are holding \u00a350,000 of my money somewhere safe. I don\u2019t know what the difficulty is,\u201d the investor told the Guardian.</p> \n<p>Rajat Sharma, a partner at Metis Law, said: \u201cThe solicitors\u2019 professional rules prohibit the firm from engaging in any dialogue with third parties about any client\u2019s affairs without the express consent of that client.

      "bodyText": "Vijay Devadoss is a 62-year-old retired NHS orthopaedic surgeon who invested \u00a3450,000 in nine rooms in Gavin Woodhouse\u2019s Clifton Moor development in June 2015. He was told that Clifton Moor would be operational and generating profits from last year but, at the site near Wigan, there is an overgrown plot where the care home should now be. Devadoss was expecting his first interest payment of \u00a378,000 from Woodhouse\u2019s company, Northern Powerhouse Developments (NPD), on 6 June this year but it has yet to arrive. He is disturbed to discover the status of the site. \u201cI was expecting a nursing home with 70 beds, so I\u2019m really shocked to see that nothing has happened,\u201d he said earlier this month. \u201cIf my wife was here, she would start to cry. I\u2019m really upset but what else can I do? \u201c[I\u2019m] devastated and really disgusted; more so because my wife is so upset. She is in a position where she has to carry on working. \u201cWe were banking on [the interest payment] for our future. It is our real lifetime savings and pension for us. Because of this both of us have to rethink our plans and carry on working.\u201d Devadoss is not the only investor in Woodhouse\u2019s care home projects who is concerned about what might happen to their savings. Earlier this year Woodhouse wrote to investors admitting to cashflow problems and telling them he would be rescheduling their dividends. Another investor, who did not want to be named but put about \u00a340,000 into the Walsden care home project in West Yorkshire in 2014, said: \u201cWhen my dad died, he said to me: \u2018Put the money that you will get from the house into property.\u2019 So we followed his advice. We thought this [project] is really good, it fits in with the amount we can afford and it\u2019s a really worthwhile thing because we like to be altruistic and help other people through life.\u201d Annual scheduled dividends have been delayed in each year of the investment and only received after sustained chasing. It has left the investor worried if they will ever see their money again. \u201cI wish I\u2019d never seen [this investment] \u2026 There are so many people who have put much more than we have into it and my heart bleeds for them. I really don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll get the money at all. There was my dad giving what he thought was sensible advice and I sort of let him down. It\u2019s quite upsetting really. I feel I\u2019ve been taken for a mug, as so many people have.\u201d In Burnley at Hawthorn, the third unbuilt care home for which Woodhouse raised funds, another investor who did not want to be identified has been trying to confirm that his money is safe for almost a year. Communications with NPD\u2019s sales agents had left him with the firm impression that the funds raised to build Hawthorn were being safeguarded by Woodhouse\u2019s solicitor, Metis Law. But repeated efforts to obtain proof the money was safe were frustrated over many months. \u201cAll I\u2019m asking for is that they are holding \u00a350,000 of my money somewhere safe. I don\u2019t know what the difficulty is,\u201d the investor told the Guardian. Rajat Sharma, a partner at Metis Law, said: \u201cThe solicitors\u2019 professional rules prohibit the firm from engaging in any dialogue with third parties about any client\u2019s affairs without the express consent of that client. In the case of Northern Powerhouse Developments Ltd, we did not have that consent. Accordingly, we were unable to answer investors\u2019 questions.\u201d Woodhouse now says the funds are not with Metis but \u201cin bank accounts, which are separate and allocated to each SPV [special project vehicle]\u201d. A spokesman for NPD said: \u201cWe have up to 600 investors, the vast majority of which have not voiced concerns. The allegations made by the Guardian and ITV concern a handful of disgruntled investors and do not reflect the view of investors in Northern Powerhouse Developments as a whole.\u201d Northern Powerhouse Developments denies any wrongdoing. Here is its complete response.",

Three unbuilt care homes Hawthorn, Burnley In the middle of May 2019, Woodhouse told investors in his yet-to-be-started Hawthorn care village near Burnley that the \u201cproject is now progressing \u2026 we are now in talks with the council and progressing with planning\u201d. What investors were not told was that the land earmarked for the home is owned by Lancashire county council, which says it informed Hawthorn\u2019s solicitor in April 2018 that it \u201cwould not be proceeding with the sale\u201d. The council has confirmed that its position has not changed since last year, while planning has never been submitted to Burnley council. Days after claiming in May that the project was progressing \u2013 and after Woodhouse became aware of the Guardian and ITV News investigation \u2013 he published an update telling investors he was now looking for a new site for Hawthorn.

Woodhouse also said that no contradictory statements had been made, and that another site for the care home had been identified. He added that it was a coincidence that the update was sent to property owners the same day he became aware of the Guardian and ITV News investigation. Clifton Moor, Tyldesley The Clifton Moor care home near Wigan was also launched in 2014 and raised \u00a34m \u2013 \u00a32.1m net \u2013 according to leaked documents seen by the Guardian and ITV News. The care home has never been built and in May \u2013 after Woodhouse became aware his business interests were the subject of a media investigation \u2013 the businessman conceded to his investors that the project had \u201cslowed to a stop\u201d. This might have been a shock to some of them, as Woodhouse had informed the same investors only a month before that there had been \u201chuge progress\u201d with the development.

It said it had never received the evidence and has not heard from the company or its representatives in almost a year. Woodhouse said that he was told by his contractors that \u201cthe approval from United Utilities had been secured\u201d. While there has been a lack of construction activity at the site, the project company seems to have moved funds around. MBI Clifton Moor Ltd appeared to have loaned \u00a31.5m to MBI Consulting, according to the administrator\u2019s report into the latter company. The latest accounts for MBI Clifton Moor Ltd to March 2018, which were signed off by Woodhouse, show the care home company had no cash on its balance sheet. Woodhouse said the change in his position on the progress at the care home from April to May in 2019 was because the contractors had stopped working. He added that it was a coincidence that the update had been sent to property owners the same day he became aware of the media investigation. Woodhouse said he still plans to build care homes at Clifton Moor and Hawthorn. Walsden care village, Calderdale The Walsden care village project was launched by Woodhouse in 2014 and raised \u00a35.8m from private investors, according to leaked documents seen by the Guardian and ITV News. That gave the project net cash raised of \u00a33.8m. Nothing has been built at the site and investors were told that delays have been caused by problems in obtaining planning permission because of the 2015 flooding in the Calder Valley. However, there has never been a planning permission application for a care home at that site according to Calderdale council and, while the bursting of the banks of the river Calder did make the national news four years ago, the floods never reached the planned Walsden site, according to the Environment Agency. The land is owned by a company called MBI Walsden Care Ltd, of which Woodhouse is the major shareholder. He resigned from the board of that company in 2016 and Forster is the company\u2019s sole remaining director. Despite construction work failing to start at Walsden, the latest accounts for MBI Walsden to March 2017 suggest the company has loaned more than \u00a33m to companies controlled by Woodhouse. Its accounts state it had no cash left of its own. Included in those loans is \u00a31.8m advanced to MBI Consulting, according to that company\u2019s administrator\u2019s report. Woodhouse said he has had nothing to do with Walsden since resigning in 2016, and directed all Walsden inquiries to Forster. Forster disputes this. When asked by the undercover reporter about the project in May, Woodhouse said he was planning to build a care home at Walsden. Hotels Northern Powerhouse Developments (NPD), Woodhouse\u2019s company, has a portfolio of 11 operational UK hotels. The model is to find underperforming hotels in need of renovation, and then agree to buy them. Before completing the deal, Woodhouse sells rooms in the hotel to private investors in order to fund the acquisition and renovation of the property. The investors then rent the rooms back to him over the next decade. Of the portfolio of 11, none of the hotels made an operating profit, according to the last set of filed accounts from each. The overall group did, however, book a profit in its last set of published accounts after NPD increased its assessment of the value of its hotels in its books. Included in NPD\u2019s recent revaluations is the group\u2019s Fishguard Bay hotel in Pembrokeshire, which was acquired in June 2017 for \u00a3966,720. Two years later it is yet to be renovated but the company claims the hotel is now worth \u00a36.7m. In recent months, NPD has also been selling investors rooms in two hotels that the group is hoping to buy. The completion date for the purchases were scheduled for the first week in June. Woodhouse failed to complete the deals on deadline. Woodhouse said NPD had gone from owning four hotels to 11 in one year, and that the first year\u2019s trading is always tough.

His business interests include care homes, hotels, leisure facilities and student accommodation and he has been listed as a director 137 times with Companies House. Woodhouse began his business career as a teenager cleaning cars. \u201cI was always a clever little git that thought he knew something that they didn\u2019t, and one day somebody said: \u2018Put up or shut up\u2019 and I sort of thought I\u2019d better put my money where my mouth is,\u201d he says. \u201cMy first experience as an entrepreneur was maybe working within the car industry and just seeing that cars needed cleaning.

That was my first experience of cleaning cars and selling cars was probably my first experience at a young age.\u201d His personal website reports how the business \u201cwas such a success that within two years he had helped create a multimillion-pound financial facility for the funding of vehicles to large independent financial advisory and accountancy groups across the globe\u201d. Woodhouse then moved into property development and raising funds to build care homes, buy hotels and \u2013 eventually \u2013 build the Afan Valley adventure resort. His website also describes him as a \u201cbusiness mentor\u201d and the advice on offer includes: five lessons you can learn from failure; how to optimise your decision making; simple strategies for overcoming procrastination; and how to improve your personal brand. His career has allowed him to enjoy many of the trappings of a successful entrepreneur. He lives in a 17th-century country house, which estate agents have described as a \u201cmagnificent Grade I-listed six-bedroom country residence with staff quarters \u2026 Over the years this has been home to eminent local businessmen and visited by prime ministers and dignitar[ies] \u2026 The hall stands in manicured gardens and grounds of approximately 4.8 acres\u201d. The driveway is adorned with a string of luxury cars \u2013 a Bentley, a Tesla, a Porsche and a Range Rover \u2013 while Woodhouse\u2019s love of social media reveals his taste for pursuits such as skiing, skydiving and snorkelling with whale sharks.",

      "bodyText": "Finally, another underwhelming trading session is over in the City. The FTSE 100 has closed 6 points lower at 7,416 points. Mark Carney\u2019s concerns about no-deal worries hurting the economy weighted on the market, with the pound hovering below $1.27 still. Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at www.cityindex.co.uk, says trade war optimism was limited too: Comments from Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin that a US \u2013 Sino trade deal was 90% done has fuelled optimism that the two sides could finally achieve a trade agreement. US equities have moved higher in early trade on the news, paring some of yesterday\u2019s Fed inspired losses. Any good news on trade is good news for the equity markets. However, the reaction is actually fairly tame to the attention-grabbing headline, both the Dow and the S&amp;P are up around 0.2% and parts of Europe remain in the red. Investors are not getting carried away opting to sit on the side-lines as they look cautiously ahead to the G20 summit this weekend. A side meeting between Trump and China\u2019s President Jinping Xi could give vital clues as to whether the two powers are onside to resolve the ongoing trade dispute. Wall Street has opened higher, as investors are cheered by Stephen Mnuchin\u2019s claim that the US-China trade deal is 90% complete. Tech shares are among the risers, despite Donald Trump\u2019s threat to sue the likes of Twitter and Google.... Donald Trump attacked tech companies today, because he reckons they discriminate against him because he\u2019s a Republican. He told Fox that social media firms such as Twitter are unfairly throttling his follower numbers (a claim he\u2019s made before). He also cites a recording released yesterday of a Google executive discussing plans to prevent another \u201cTrump situation\u201d. The president says: \u201cTwitter is just terrible, what they do. They don\u2019t let you get the word out. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, they should be sued because what\u2019s happening with the bias \u2014 and now you see it with that executive yesterday from Google. The hatred for the Republicans: It\u2019s not even like \u2018Gee! Let\u2019s lean Democrat.\u2019\u201d \u201cThese people are all Democrats, it\u2019s totally biased toward Democrats. If I announced tomorrow that I\u2019m going to become a nice liberal Democrat, I would pick up five times more followers. Take a deep breath before watching this clip of Donald Trump rubbishing America\u2019s top central banker on Fox News today: Back in the UK, Bathstore, the country\u2019s biggest bathroom specialist, has collapsed into administration after failing to find a buyer, putting more than 500 jobs at risk. Just the latest in a string of retail failures that have cost tens of thousands of jobs this year. Here\u2019s the full story: Wowzers. Donald Trump has suggested he could widen his trade war to include Vietnam. Here\u2019s a clip from his Fox News appearance: The Financial Times have a good take on Mark Carney\u2019s criticism of investment funds built on the \u201clie\u201d of instant redemptions. Here\u2019s a flavour: The Bank of England governor said that all fund investors should expect to have redemption terms that were in line with the liquidity of the assets that underpinned them and should not be able to assume they could get their hands on their money daily. \u201cThese funds are built on a lie, which is you can have daily liquidity,\u201d Mr Carney told MPs on the Treasury select committee. For assets that \u201cfundamentally aren\u2019t liquid\u201d or might become illiquid in a market downturn, he said the damage of that \u201clie\u201d for financial stability is that it \u201cleads to an expectation for individuals that it\u2019s not that different from having money in a bank\u201d. \u201cWe do have to be very deliberate about the types of measures that need to be taken \u2014 something that better aligns the redemption terms with the actual liquidity of the underlying investment is infinitely preferable to the situation we have today,\u201d the governor said. Donald Trump has used an interview on Fox News to blast a range of targets - from America\u2019s top central banker to its largest tech companies. He also took a swipe at Japan, shortly before heading to Tokyo for the G20 summit: Newsflash from America: Durable goods orders fell sharply last month, raising new fears about the health of the US economy. New orders for durable goods (such as transportation and machinery) fell by 1.3% in May, led by a drop in airline sales. That follows a 2.8% tumble in April, and is weaker than expected. Demand for capital goods (expensive equipment) fell by 3.3%, and computer-related orders slid by 2.4%. City experts say Mark Carney is correct to predict interest rates would be cut after a no-deal Brexit. Joshua Roberts, associate director at JCRA, says investors had already worked this out for themselves: \u201cCarney\u2019s comments are hardly a revelation for the market, which has been judging a rate cut as more likely than a hike for over a month. The logic is inescapable: if the flow of goods and services between the UK and its most important trading partner is severely disrupted, the Bank of England has a duty to try and stabilise the resulting economic shock.\u201d Oliver Blackbourn, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, says the Bank is in the hands of Westminster: Carney made it clear that he and some others on the MPC favour more support in the event of a no-deal Brexit. With the Brexit forecast assumption dependent on government policy, we are back to awaiting the new Prime Minister and their ability to manage parliament for indications of future BoE decisions.\u201d Mark Carney has given his strongest hint yet that the Bank of England could cut interest rates back toward record lows, if Britain crashed out of the EU without a deal. The BoE governor told the Treasury committee that many policymakers, himself included, believe they would need to protect the economy through a new stimulus package. Previously, the Bank has suggested it could hike interest rates to prop up the pound and fight inflation, if no-deal caused a sterling crisis and made imports expensive and hard o obtain. But today, Carney said: In the event that there is no deal, the response would not be automatic, it would depend on demand, on supply and where the exchange rate went. Some of us, myself included, have said it is not equally weighted. However, if Britain leaves with a \u2018smooth Brexit\u2019, the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee expect to raise rates in a gradual, limited way. Carney also warned that fears of a no-deal Brexit have risen recently, dragging business investment back and hurting the economy. Financial markets are also anticipating the risk of a disorderly Brexit. Carney said: The path of interest rates, in the markets judgment, is lower because they are ascribing some possibility to no-deal. And in the event of no-deal, that interest rates would be lower than they otherwise would be. The governor reiterated that Britain couldn\u2019t rely on \u201cGatt 24\u201d to insist on tariff-free trade with the EU after a no-deal Brexit. This WTO rule could only be used as part of an agreement between London and Brussels, Carney explained. He also slapped down suggestions that Britain should just get Brexit over with and leave on 31, pointing out that a transition period is crucial to help companies adjust. The Bank also denied that there are too many \u2018zombie companies\u2019, propped up by low interest rates. On world affairs, Carney said that trade war tensions have risen since the Bank issued its latest quarterly inflation report in May (just before Donald Trump announced new tariffs on China). But he remains confident that the Federal Reserve will maintain its independence, despite political pressure from Donald Trump. He also chastised fund managers who invest in illiquid assets but offer their customers instant redemptions, saying they are \u201cbuilt on a lie\u201d. This is a hot issue, since Neil Woodford blocked investors from quitting his equity income fund after a wave of redemptions. Carney warned: \u201cThis is a big deal. You can see something that could be systemic. \u201cThese funds are built on a lie, which is that you can have daily liquidity for assets that fundamentally aren\u2019t liquid. And that leads to an expectation of individuals that it\u2019s not that different to having money in a bank.\u201d Mark Carney finally turns to another issue -- investment funds, which are in the spotlight since Neil Woodford locked down his equity income fund to halt a wave of redemptions. Some funds are \u201cbuilt on a lie\u201d, says Carney severely, the idea that you can have daily liquidity from a fund that holds illiquid assets. That encourages small investors to treat such holdings as \u2018money in the bank\u2019, which you can get instant access to, the governor tells the Treasury committee. Woodford investors now know the truth.... That\u2019s the end of the session. Q: Are low interest rates allowing an army of zombie firms to \u201cstagger on\u201d, endangering financial stability, asks Steve Baker MP. Bank of England policymaker Michael Saunders isn\u2019t too worried. He says the number of firms with low profits compared to their interest payments are stable. Yes, there would be more of them if interest rates were higher -- but that could also drive firms to the wall, hurting the wider economy (and creating another wave of zombies)..... Q: Young people are growing up in an era where interest rates have been extremely low for a decade - isn\u2019t that a problem for the future? Umbrella\u2019s don\u2019t cause rain, shoots back Mark Carney (quoting his MPC colleague Gertjan Vlieghe) There are structural reasons why borrowing costs are so low - central banks are providing support to help economies. But yes, there are macro-prudential risks from such low interest rates, Carney says. Q: Back in 2014, you told the committee that monetary policy was at \u201cextraordinary, if not emergency\u201d settings. Would you agree that it still is? Carney does not -- even though interest rates (0.75%) are barely higher than five years ago (0.5%). He argues that \u2018equilibrium\u2019 interest rates (the point where you\u2019re neither stimulating nor strangling the economy) are lower than in 2014. So borrowing costs today are \u2018accommodative\u2019, but not extraordinarily so, the governor insists. Mark Carney warns that \u201ccrystallising\u201d businesses\u2019 concerns over Brexit, by plunging out of the EU without a deal, would cause economic damage. It would lead to some \u2018capital scrapping\u2019 as firms canned equipment, which would also hurt skilled workers, he adds. Back in Westminster, Mark Carney has warned MPs that pay growth will probably slow this summer - having clawed its way up to 3.5% per year. He says the \u2018tightness in the labour market\u2019 has pushed earnings up recently, but Britain has still suffered the worst decade for real pay growth since the 1850s. George Osborne never managed to balance the books as UK chancellor, and he\u2019s not doing much better following his switch to journalism. Osborne\u2019s Evening Standard lost more than \u00a311m before tax last year, but did achieve a 2% rise in revenues in a tough market. Jack Maidment of Mail Online suspects that Mark Carney and Boris Johnson aren\u2019t poles apart on Gatt 24, following the governor\u2019s comments earlier. The issue, though, is whether the EU would go along with Boris\u2019s Plan B, if it didn\u2019t provide a solution to the Irish border question, or settle Britain\u2019s outstanding financial liabilities.... Deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe has warned the committee that the international economy is providing less support to the UK than in 2018. Q: Don\u2019t we need to conclude Brexit by Halloween, and end this nightmare, one way or another, asks Brexiteer MP Charlie Elphicke. Mark Carney does his best impression of an Oxbridge don, telling the committee dryly that: There\u2019s a reason that that 40-plus trade deals stuck between advanced economies in the last quarter century have always had a transition from the status quo to the new arrangement.... I would underscore that it is highly desirable to give businesses enough time to adjust to the new reality. Of course, it also matters what that new situation is, adds MPC member Silvana Tenreyro. Worryingly, Mark Carney doesn\u2019t expect the weak business investment to recover soon. Survey data suggests it was weak in the current quarter (April-June). MPC member Michael Saunders chimes in, reiterating that market fears of a no-deal Brexit have risen. The outlook for the economy would be very different now (ie better), if we knew now that we\u2019d see a smooth Brexit, rather than face rolling deadlines and uncertainty, Saunders adds. Mark Carney adds that the housing market has suffered from Brexit uncertainty, as the deadlines for Britain\u2019s departure have been pushed back. [prices in London and the South East have been falling for several months] Q: Isn\u2019t it \u201cunreal\u201d for the BoE to still be assuming a smooth Brexit in its forecasts, then? Carney replies that the markets don\u2019t believe no-deal is the most likely outlook - it\u2019s not the official policy of the government, or either Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt. But the Bank is working constantly on its no-deal preparations, in case. Q: Do you think the risk of a no-deal Brexit is growing? Carney turns the question deftly back onto the Treasury committee -- pointing out that it\u2019s the government\u2019s job to plot the path forwards, and parliament\u2019s job to approve it or not. There has been a \u201cnotable increase\u201d in market expectations of no-deal, he adds. This uncertainty is hurting business investment, and hurting the UK\u2019s short-term economic performance. Deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe weighs in too -- telling MPs that \u201cwe look to you\u201d. The BoE is only a central bank, after all.... Q: The Westminster Village have been frantically googling \u201cGatt 24\u201d (after Boris Johnson suggested it could be used to guarantee free trade with the EU). You have suggested otherwise.... [Reminder for any MPs baffled by Google: Gatt 24 allows tariff-free trade for up to 10 years while a permanent trade agreement is negotiated]. Mark Carney explains that the UK cannot \u2018unilaterally\u2019 used Gatt 24 - there has to be an agreement in place too. If other WTO members agree that both are sides working towards a free trade deal, then tariff barriers can be lowered. The governor then explains that you can\u2019t have \u2018no deal and Gatt 24\u2019, joking that it may all come down to symantics -- but as a Canadian, he understands that \u2018agreement\u2019 means \u2018deal\u2019 in English. Q: So Gatt 24 can\u2019t apply in a no-deal situation? There has to be an agreement, yes, Carney confirms. Not necessarily the Withdrawal Agreement, but something. Q: Is that Bank of England worried by Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on the Federal Reserve (demanding interest rate cuts)? Mark Carney explains that central bank independence is important. He reassures the committee that \u201cmonetary policy hasn\u2019t been compromised in the UK\u201d (although I do remember some criticism of the BoE by Theresa May in 2016). He adds that he isn\u2019t worried that the Fed will be knocked off course from pursuing low inflation and full employment, saying: I have full confidence that the Federal Reserve will conduct a policy to achieve their dual mandate, and that the timing and extent of any policy changes will be determined by how they think they can achieve that mandate. Q: At the May inflation report, governor, you said that global trade tensions have eased? Does that still hold true? It held true for about 48 hours, Mark Carney grins, before Donald Trump tweeted he was hiking tariffs on Chinese imports. Q: Has the threat to economic growth from a trade war increased? Deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe agrees that tensions have increased, with America also threatening Mexico with tariffs and targeting European car sales. Markets are more sensitive to trade developments, Cunliffe says, warning that there are now \u201cmore ingredients\u201d for a full-blown trade war. Q: What advice do you have for your successor, Mr Carney? Carney (who is due to leave the Bank next January) says being governor is an \u201chonour and a privilege\u201d. It\u2019s also a unique role, as the Bank is responsible for financial stability as well as monetary policy. It requires a particular background and set of skills, Carney points out. Q: If Britain\u2019s next prime minister decides that leaving the EU with a deal is impossible, your next inflation report will look very different than the May one.... Carney replies that this isn\u2019t the Plan A of either candidate, but yes, in that scenario the forecasts will change. MPC policymaker Michael Saunders tells the committee that the UK economy could do \u201ca little better\u201d than the Bank forecasts, if Britain leaves the EU smoothly. In that scenario, he argues that interest rate rises will be needed. Q: But what if the Bank of England is wrong, and Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal? We would change our forecasts, Mark Carney replies. He argues that it\u2019s not \u201cautomatic\u201d whether the Bank would raise or lower interest rates, but several policymakers (including Carney) believe some stimulus would be needed. That\u2019s a hint that interest rates could be cut, to protect the economy, in a no-deal situation. Over in parliament, the Treasury Committee is holding a session with the Bank of England over its latest Quarterly Inflation Report. In the hot seats: Dr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England , Sir Jon Cunliffe, Deputy Governor for Financial Stability, and monetary policy committee members Silvana Tenreyro and Michael Saunders. Nicky Morgan, chair of the committee, asks why the financial markets haven\u2019t believed the Bank\u2019s claim that interest rates will rise faster than investors think. Carney says the Bank\u2019s forecasts are based on the assumption that Britain will leave the EU smoothly, while the markets are factoring the risk of a disorderly no-deal Brexit. In the Bank\u2019s view -- a smooth Brexit will allow interest rates to rise. As Carney puts is: When we set out the forecast... we\u2019re saying that in the event of a smooth transition to a deal, it would require limited and gradual interest rate increases [to keep inflation on target]. Newsflash: America\u2019s Treasury secretary, Stephen Mnuchin, has told CNBC that the US-China trade deal is \u201c90% complete\u201d. That may bolster confidence ahead of the G20 meeting (although, obviously, the agreement won\u2019t work without that vital last 10%...) Ouch! Rating agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s have just slashed their forecast for Italian growth this year to virtually zero. S&amp;P now expect Italy to only expand by 0.1%, down from 0.7% previously, extending a long period of weak growth (or worse). The Financial Times\u2019s Daniel Shane says Bitcoin is \u201churtling towards the $13,000 mark\u201d, for the first time since January 2018. He writes: Recent enthusiasm for bitcoin has been stoked by Facebook\u2019s foray into the world of cryptocurrencies, launching its own currency called Libra. The coin is designed as a means of payment and for international money transfers. Analysts are optimistic that Libra will help cryptocurrencies generally gain more mainstream acceptance. World leaders haven\u2019t even set foot in Tokyo yet, but the draft communique from the G20 meeting has already leaked. According to Japanese media, the statement will urge support for free trade to achieve strong global growth. However, this could be queried by the US delegation, who are pushing a more protectionist, \u2018America First\u2019, agenda. My colleague in Beijing, Lily Kuo, reports that few experts expect a substantive agreement at the G20 to end almost a year of trade tensions and months of deteriorating ties between the world\u2019s two largest economies: In the City, clothing retailer Bonmarch\u00e9 has been forced into a screeching u-turn over a takeover offer. Bonmarch\u00e9 had previously rejected a bid from retail billionaire Philip Day, claiming that it undervalued the company. But this morning, it admitted to shareholders that recent trading had been \u201cpoor\u201d, meaning it now recommends accepting Day\u2019s offer! Bonmarch\u00e9 blamed \u201ccontinued weakness in the underlying clothing market, and a lack of seasonal weather\u201d to counteract this trend. So, given the danger that trading doesn\u2019t improve, Day (who owns the Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group) suddenly looks less of a threat and more of a savour. Or as Bonmarch\u00e9\u2019s board put it: Whilst the Board\u2019s view remains that the Offer does not adequately reflect the potential longer term value of the business, the increase in uncertainty that has developed reflecting the trading and financial position of the business during the first quarter of the financial year makes the certainty represented by the Offer potentially more attractive in the short term. Shares in Bonmarch\u00e9 have promptly slumped by 20% to 11.5p, the level of Day\u2019s offer, as hopes of a rip-roaring takeover battle fade. European stock markets are subdued this morning, after America\u2019s top central banker dampened hopes of hefty interest rate cuts. Yesterday, Fed chief Jerome Powell gave a speech in New York in which he appeared to push back against Donald Trump\u2019s demands for lower borrowing costs. Powell declared: The Fed is insulated from short-term political pressures \u2014 what is often referred to as our \u2018independence. Congress chose to insulate the Fed this way because it had seen the damage that often arises when policy bends to short-term political interests. Central banks in major democracies around the world have similar independence. Powell also reiterated that the Fed will act \u201cas appropriate\u201d to sustain America\u2019s economic expansion. But this still left traders disappointed - and worried they\u2019ve been too confident in expecting a Fed rate cut in July. Stephen Innes of Vanguard Markets says Powell: ... walked back some of the market overly zealous dovish inference. This has pushed the main European indices down a little: FTSE 100: Down 8 points of 0.1% at 7,413 German DAX: Down 35 points or 0.3% at 12,192 French CAC: Down 9 points or 0.2% at 5,504 Neil Wilson of Markets.com also reckons Facebook\u2019s move into digital currencies is helping push bitcoin up (as it gives the whole sector more legitimacy). He also believes nervous investors are trying to spread their risk, in case other asset prices tumble. The biggest players are looking at cryptocurrencies afresh and don\u2019t want to miss out. There\u2019s a \u2018haven\u2019 play too as nominal and real yields have retreated sharply, reducing the opportunity cost of holding (or HODLing) bitcoin. And the liquidity injection from central banks has forced a range of assets like gold, bonds, the yen etc, so bitcoin is just being swept along by those macro currents. Whatever the cause, the momentum is powerful right now. Bitcoin has now surged by around 150% in the last two months, from around $5,100 in late April to over $12,700 this morning Marcus Swanepoel, CEO at cryptocurrency exchange Luno, says bitcoin\u2019s in a bull run, for several reasons: The bullish signals for bitcoin have been present for some time, with greater buying and interest from major banks, institutions and groups of specialist buyers adding liquidity to the market. This led to increased speculation and the price rise from April. Then the Facebook announcement of Libra showed to many financial services sectors that altcoins are going mainstream. Finally, as the geopolitical situation remains so uncertain, strategic investors are still looking at Bitcoin and Ethereum as uncorrelated with centralised assets, so provide a quasi safe-haven option. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s another jittery day in the markets, as geopolitical tensions and trade war anxiety give investors plenty to think about. Oil is the big mover this morning - Brent crude has romped to $66.25 per barrel for the first time in almost a month. This follows a report from the American Petroleum Institute showing that US crude stockpiles fell by 7.55 million barrels last week. That bigger-than-expected decline may indicate higher demand than expected. But tensions in the Middle East are also driving oil up. Relations between Washington and Tehran deteriorated further yesterday as Donald Trump threatened to obliterate parts of Iran, after president Rouhani suggested the US leader was \u201cafflicted by a mental disorder\u201d. This sort of \u201cjaw-jaw\u201d antics only increase worries of military action, disrupting supplies. No wonder oil is up 10% since two tankers were attacked in the Gulf of Oman two weeks ago. Investors are also getting nervous about this week\u2019s G20 meeting of world leaders, which kicks off on Friday. Trump is due to meet China\u2019s Xi Jinping on Saturday, for a crucial meeting on trade. American officials say their aim is to restart negotiations, suggesting the two sides could agree not to impose more tariffs while talks are underway. Bloomberg is reporting that the U.S. could suspend the next round of tariffs on an additional $300bn of Chinese imports. But nothing\u2019s guaranteed. And in such turbulent times, some traders are turning to cryptocurrencies for protection. Bitcoin has continued its recent strong rally, hurtling through the $12,000 mark for the first time in 15 months today. It\u2019s currently up 8.4%, or $986, at $12,737. And with Facebook\u2019s new Libra currency getting plenty of attention, some analysts are predicting that digital coins will keep climbing. Also coming up today Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, is being quizzed by MPs on the Treasury committee. Officially it\u2019s about the Bank\u2019s last quarterly inflation report, but Brexit and trade rules may also come up too (especially as Carney shot down Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit idea last week). Plus, new US durable goods and trade data will show if America\u2019s economy is suffering from the trade dispute with China. The agenda 10.15am BST: Treasury committee hearing with the Bank of England 1.30pm BST: US durable goods orders for May 1.30pm BST: US trade goods for May",

      "bodyText": "IVF success rates decline significantly in older men, according to scientists who call for greater awareness of the male biological clock. The analysis of nearly 5,000 IVF cycles performed at a London fertility clinic found that success rates were about one fifth lower in men aged over 51 compared with men under 35, when the effect of the age of their female partners was taken into account. Speaking at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology\u2019s annual meeting in Vienna, Guy Morris, who led the study, said stories of celebrity men fathering children into their 60s had helped perpetuate a myth that \u201cmale fertility lasts for ever\u201d. \u201cThere may well be a public perception that male fertility is independent of age,\u201d said Morris, from the Centre for Reproductive and Genetic Health (CRGH) in London. \u201cIndeed, in natural conception and pregnancy it is only recently that evidence of risks associated with later fatherhood has become available.\u201d The study, thought to be the largest of its kind in men over 50, found a steady decline in IVF success rates in successive age brackets from 35 upwards. However, in the under 50s, this trend appeared to be largely accounted for by the age of the man\u2019s female partner. Beyond 51 years, there was a significant decline in success rates, irrespective of the age of the woman, the study found. For a woman aged 36 years, the scientists calculated an average success rate of 45% if her partner was under 35 compared with a 35% success rate if he was over 51. The success rates were looked at retrospectively, meaning the scientists could not be sure that the men represented a random sample and the study did not take into account lifestyle factors such as weight, smoking or drinking, which could also influence outcomes independently of age. However, the scientists did find indications that sperm quality was worse in the older men. The analysis also showed that just 42% of those over 51 had sperm count and sperm motility measures within the healthy range defined by the World Health Organization, compared with 61% of those in younger age brackets. Previous research has suggested that sperm in older men has more DNA damage and that there is a slightly increased risk of older men fathering children with genetic disorders. \u201cOur data certainly support the importance of educating men about their fertility and the risks of delaying fatherhood,\u201d said Morris. Prof Ying Cheong, honorary consultant in reproductive medicine and surgery at the University of Southampton, said: \u201cThis study again highlights that men are not immune to the impact of biological ageing as far as their fertility is concerned, although this detrimental impact arrives later than women.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 27 June 2019. In an earlier version, the text and headline incorrectly said that IVF success rates were found to be about one third lower in men aged over 51 compared with men under 35.",

Threadneedle Street can support economic growth by cutting interest rates or using quantitative easing \u2013 buying government bonds from commercial banks to pump up the amount of money circulating in the economy. \u201cIt\u2019s more likely we would provide some stimulus\u201d in the event of no-deal Brexit, he told the MPs. \u201cWe have said we would do what we could in the event of a no-deal scenario but there is no guarantee on that.\u201d The Bank has previously said its response to no deal would not be automatic, meaning it could raise interest rates should it need to counter rising inflation caused by a sudden drop in the pound.

You can buy one to use on the socket you plug your mower into.\u201d Shaw advises checking whether your appliances have been recalled (in the UK, at registermyappliance.org.uk). \u201cDon\u2019t leave a washing machine, tumble drier or dishwasher going when you go to bed,\u201d he says. Dishwashers can have problems with control units and door switches; tumble driers with an inadequate seal can have lint or fluff blown directly on to the element. \u201cIf you\u2019re leaving your tumble dryer on, make sure you remain on the same floor. If you have concerns, fit an additional smoke alarm.\u201d",

Reaching UK arenas on Friday, it features a hydraulic stage, multiple costume changes and fearsome pyrotechnics, and it will carry her from Greensboro, North Carolina, to Detroit, Michigan, via the Glastonbury festival this weekend.</p> <p>The most successful winner of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/american-idol\">American Idol</a>, triumphing in the TV talent show\u2019s fourth season in 2005, Underwood has since recorded six albums, sold over 65m records, won seven Grammys, and earned more than $83m (\u00a365m).

At the time it was awful, and it still hurts, but it\u2019s kind of like OK, I have this.\u201d Underwood\u2019s producer, David Garcia, says the number one question she gets asked is whether or not she genuinely writes songs, \u201cor does she just show up and Instagram the whole time?\u201d Underwood not only writes, she also co-produced this record \u2014 an anomaly in the male-dominated world of country music. \u201cI mean, I get it: if you were a songwriter in Nashville, and 90-plus per cent of artists are male, are you going to go into your writing session and write a song for a woman?\u201d She looks resolute. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll do it myself.\u201d She pours one last glass before she heads to the bus and the crying baby. \u201cBut we do it all. In high heels. I\u2019ll be waking up at God knows what time in the morning feeding my baby \u2013 no one else can do that, and I\u2019m proud of that.\u201d Carrie Underwood is at the Birmingham Arena on Friday 28 June, Glastonbury on 29 June, then touring the UK until Thursday 4 July",

      "bodyText": "The grim reality of the migration crisis unfolding on America\u2019s southern border has been captured in photographs showing the lifeless bodies of a Salvadoran father and his daughter who drowned as they attempted to cross the Rio Grande into Texas. The images, taken on Monday, show \u00d3scar Alberto Mart\u00ednez Ram\u00edrez, 26, and his daughter Valeria, lying face down in shallow water. The 23-month-old toddler\u2019s arm is draped around her father\u2019s neck, suggesting that she was clinging to him in her final moments. The UN refugee agency compared the photograph to the 2015 image of the three-year-old Syrian boy Alan Kurdi who drowned off the Greek island of Kos \u2013 although it remains to be seen if it will have the same impact on America\u2019s fierce immigration debate. Their bodies were discovered on the bank of the river near Matamoros, Mexico, across from Brownsville, Texas, just half a mile (1km) from an international bridge. According to Julia Le Duc, a reporter for La Jornada, Mart\u00ednez Ram\u00edrez had arrived in Matamoros on Sunday, hoping to request asylum from US authorities with his wife, Vanessa \u00c1valos, and their daughter. But when he realized that it could be weeks before they were even able to start the asylum process, Mart\u00ednez decided they should swim across, said Le Duc, who witnessed \u00c1valos give her account to the police. \u201cHe crossed first with the little girl and he left her on the American side. Then he turned back to get his wife, but the girl went into the water after him. When he went to save her, the current took them both,\u201d Le Duc told the Guardian. The image underlines the dangers which mostly Central American migrants face in their attempts to escape violence, corruption and poverty at home and find asylum in the United States. As part of a broader crack down on migration, the Trump administration tightened the country\u2019s asylum system, creating a growing backlog of cases. Migrants are routinely forced to wait for months to start the asylum process; those who despair of waiting turn to more remote and dangerous routes across the southern frontier. On Sunday, two babies, a toddler and a woman were found dead after succumbing to heat exhaustion in Anzalduas Park, which borders the river in the city of Mission. Elsewhere three children and a woman from Honduras died in April after their raft capsized on the Rio Grande, and a six-year-old from India was found dead earlier this month in Arizona, where temperatures routinely soar well above 100F. So far this year, dozens of people have died attempting to cross the Rio Grande, where water levels are at their highest levels in 20 years and record levels of snowmelt run-off have transformed the river into a raging torrent. Claudia Hern\u00e1ndez, a Mexican police officer in the border town of Piedras Negras, told the Guardian: \u201cThe river is treacherous and people who aren\u2019t from here don\u2019t know that. I grew up here along the R\u00edo Bravo River [R\u00edo Grande]. I wouldn\u2019t even go into that water to bathe or swim.

They just want to cross. So they go to the river and without any form of protection \u2013 no lifejacket, nothing to save them \u2013 they go into the river.

Every human being has the right to migrate. It\u2019s a human right.\u201d Meanwhile Mexico has launched its own crackdown on migrants as the government scrambles to ward off Trump\u2019s threat of trade tariffs. \u201cVery regrettable that this would happen,\u201d said President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador on Tuesday in response to a question about the latest deaths on the border. \u201cAs there is more rejection in the United States, there are people who lose their lives in the desert or crossing\u201d the river.

Bukele\u2019s office responded by asking G\u00f3mez to send a private message and promised to start the repatriations. On Wednesday, Pope Francis expressed \u201cimmense sadness\u201d over the fate of Mart\u00ednez and his daughter. \u201cThe pope is profoundly saddened by their death, and is praying for them and for all migrants who have lost their lives while seeking to flee war and misery,\u201d a spokesman said in a statement.

      "bodyText": "On Monday, Megan Rapinoe scored two goals to send the US through to the quarter-finals of the Women\u2019s World Cup. On Wednesday, the President of the United States warned her not to \u201cdisrespect\u201d her country. Rapinoe, who has won the World Cup and Olympics with the USWNT, is outspoken on social issues and was the first white professional athlete to kneel for the national anthem in protest of social injustice in the United States, before US Soccer passed a rule requiring team members to stand for the anthem. In a video that has circulated on social media since Tuesday \u2013 but appears to have been filmed before the World Cup started \u2013 she said that she would not visit the White House if the team wins the tournament. On Wednesday, Trump responded to Rapinoe\u2019s comments, although he addressed Twitter user @meganrapino rather than Rapinoe\u2019s official account @mPinoe before correcting it about an hour later. \u201cWomen\u2019s soccer player, @meganrapino, just stated that she is \u201cnot going to the F...ing White House if we win.\u201d Other than the NBA, which now refuses to call owners, owners (please explain that I just got Criminal Justice Reform passed, Black unemployment is at the lowest level... ....in our Country\u2019s history, and the poverty index is also best number EVER), leagues and teams love coming to the White House. I am a big fan of the American Team, and Women\u2019s Soccer, but Megan should WIN first before she TALKS! \u201cFinish the job! We haven\u2019t yet........invited Megan or the team, but I am now inviting the TEAM, win or lose. Megan should never disrespect our Country, the White House, or our Flag, especially since so much has been done for her &amp; the team. Be proud of the Flag that you wear. The USA is doing GREAT!\u201d If the US do refuse a visit to the White House, they would be following in the footsteps of the Golden State Warriors, who did not meet with the President after winning the NBA championship, and the Philadelphia Eagles, who skipped the trip after winning Super Bowl LII. Other US championship teams have visited Trump although some players on nearly every one of those teams have chosen to stay away. Rapinoe\u2019s teammates Becky Sauerbrunn and Alex Morgan have also said that they will not attend the White House should the team win the World Cup. The US met with Barack Obama after they won the World Cup in 2015. Veteran fullback Ali Krieger, who is engaged to teammate Ashlyn Harris, voiced her support for Rapinoe on Wednesday, saying that she would also decline a White House visit and doesn\u2019t \u201csupport this administration nor their fight against LGBTQ+ citizens, immigrants &amp; our most vulnerable\u201d. Trump\u2019s remarks came one day after he said he did not think it was appropriate for Rapinoe, a co-captain of the US team, to protest during the anthem during an interview with The Hill. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Trump said when asked about Rapinoe\u2019s actions. The 33-year-old Rapinoe has been outspoken about LGBTQ rights as well as racial and gender equality.

Contested by \u2026 deep breath \u2026 30 teams from the Scottish Professional Football League, four each from the Highland and Lowland Leagues, as well as two \u201cguest\u201d teams from the Norn Iron, O\u2019Ireland and Welsh top flights. Plus Wrexham and Solihull from England\u2019s National League are thrown in for good measure, just to make the whole thing a little more confusing. Previously sponsored by the bubblegum-flavoured, sugar-saturated and peculiarly Scottish hangover cure that is Irn-Bru, this competition to showcase the most mediocre football talent in Britain and O\u2019Ireland has now sold its soul to something that is arguably even more unhealthy. It will henceforth be known as the Tunnock\u2019s Caramel Wafer Challenge Cup, in a nod to a biscuit conceived in 1952 that remains popular among the kind of people who were born around the same time. Having picked a slow news day to stage their attention-grabbing draw against a backdrop of highly distinctive red, yellow and white branding, the tournament sponsors have already succeeded in their fiendish aim of grabbing the kind of Fiver headlines no amount of money or tasty Scottish chocolate treats sent in bulk to our easily findable address can usually buy.

QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI like it being hot and we\u2019ve planned for it. If we keep passing it well, the ball won\u2019t get tired. It\u2019s our English mentality to worry about the weather. For two weeks at St George\u2019s Park my players essentially lived in a sauna. We wore thermals. The players enjoy hot weather, we feel good in the heat\u201d \u2013 Phil Neville laughs in the face of hellish \u201ckiller\u201d heatwaves when there\u2019s a World Cup to be won. FIVER LETTERS \u201cOn first glance, I was sure the lamp in the background of the photo of the pensively gazing Fawaz al-Hasawi (yesterdays News, Bits and Bobs) was the 1959 FA Cup trophy, inconspicuously disguised as a lamp. I immediately thought what a good sense of humour this chap must have\u201d \u2013 James Ryan. \u201cCan you do something for me please, Fiver? Can you refer to them as Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea for a while? It might catch on as a thing if someone with as much influence as you took it up and it\u2019d make the past year or so for Derby County, seemingly spent as Chelsea\u2019s asset-polishing club, slightly more bearable\u201d \u2013 Louise Wright. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see that the fun and games in South America Dept is alive and kicking (yesterday\u2019s News, Bits and Bobs). I did wonder if it had succumbed to the cull that is rife in much of the traditional media. Next up must be the rehiring of the 1,057 pedants who seem to have gone missing too\u201d \u2013 Luke McLean. \u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure this qualifies as nominative determinism (Fiver letters passim), but I remember a joiner a few years ago now, who drove round in a van with his name on the side. \u2018Terry Bell, Joiner.\u2019 You had to wonder\u201d \u2013 Paul Dixon.

Jack Clarke, who wasn\u2019t born when Radiohead released Kid A, is coughing for the doctor at Spurs after Nasty Leeds accepted a \u00a310m offer plus add-ons for the wee scamp of a winger. Just because he likes a certain number, hipster fans\u2019 favourite David Silva is going to say adios to Manchester City at the end of next season. \u201cIt completes the cycle.

      "bodyText": "Evidence that Parkinson\u2019s disease may start off in the gut is mounting, according to new research showing proteins thought to play a key role in the disease can spread from the gastrointestinal tract to the brain. The human body naturally forms a protein called alpha-synuclein which is found, among other places, in the brain in the endings of nerve cells. However, misfolded forms of this protein that clump together are linked to damage to nerve cells, a deterioration of the dopamine system and the development of problems with movement and speech \u2013 hallmarks of Parkinson\u2019s disease. The latest findings, which are based on studies in mice, back up a long-held theory that abnormally folded alpha-synuclein may start off in the gut and then spread to the brain via the vagus nerve \u2013 a bundle of fibres that starts in the brainstem and transports signals to and from many of the body\u2019s organs, including the gut. \u201cIt supports and really provides the first experimental evidence that Parkinson\u2019s disease can start in the gut and go up the vagus nerve,\u201d said Ted Dawson, professor of neurology at the Johns Hopkins University school of medicine and co-author of the research. The researchers say the way the misfolded alpha-synuclein spreads in the brains of the mice, and the animals\u2019 symptoms, closely mirrors the disease in humans. \u201cWe have what we think is a really accurate [animal] model that can be used to work out mechanisms \u2013 but also to test therapies,\u201d said Dawson, saying one possibility may be to interfere with the misfolding of alpha-synuclein in the gut to stop Parkinson\u2019s disease in its tracks. The study comes months after a different group of researchers revealed that people whose appendix was removed early in life had a reduced risk of later developing Parkinson\u2019s disease \u2013 a finding experts said also supports the idea the disease may begin in the gut. Writing in the journal Neuron, Dawson and colleagues describe how they conducted a series of experiments involving more than 100 mice. First, the team injected abnormally folded alpha-synuclein into the gut of healthy mice and tracked where the protein turned up. After one month the misfolded protein was present in several structures within the brainstem, while at three months it was also found in other regions of the brain including the amygdala and part of the midbrain rich in dopamine neurons. After seven months it was present in even more areas. The team say that fits with the way markers of Parkinson\u2019s disease are distributed throughout the human brain at different stages in the disease. Further work revealed the mice showed a drop in dopamine levels in the brain, followed by a progressive loss of dopamine neurons from seven months. They also showed problems in their motor skills \u2013 such as having difficulties in building a nest \u2013 as well as memory, anxiety and behaviour problems. The team repeated the injection of misfolded alpha-synuclein both in mice with a severed vagus nerve as well as mice genetically engineered to be unable to produce normal alpha-synuclein. Neither type of mice ended up with the misfolded protein in the brain, damage to their dopamine system or any motor, memory or behavioural problems . The team say these results suggest misfolded alpha-synuclein travels to the brain via the vagus nerve, with the injected proteins triggering normal alpha-synuclein in the mice to become misfolded, resulting in a sort of domino effect that leads to misfolded proteins reaching the brain. However there are some curiosities. For example, while problems with smell is an early symptom of Parkinson\u2019s disease in humans, the olfactory system was not affected in mice until several months after injection of the misfolded alpha-synuclein into their gut. And mysteries remain, including why some people have clumps of the abnormal protein in the brain but no symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease \u2013 and how alpha-synuclein becomes misfolded in the first place. Dr Beckie Port, research manager at the charity Parkinson\u2019s UK, said the latest research builds on previous studies.\u201cThis study adds support to a growing base of evidence [implying] that changes in the gut play a key role in the initiation of Parkinson\u2019s, although it is not believed to be the only place where the condition may start,\u201d she said. \u201cBy identifying and halting these changes before they reach the brain, we may be able to prevent the majority of Parkinson\u2019s symptoms ever appearing and improve the lives of people who will be affected.\u201d",

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.</p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europeif there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Speaking to journalists at a hustings with his Lib Dem leadership rival Jo Swinson, Davey said it was an \u201cextreme option\u201d and said he had not done the numbers.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think it has to be a Labour MP because most MPs supporting the Queen\u2019s speech in this government of national unity would be Labour.

It\u2019s the greatest job I\u2019ve ever had in government. It\u2019s an amazing department that makes a huge difference around the world. And it\u2019s greatly admired. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve worked with the Department for International Development in Iraq, Afghanistan going back over 15, 16 years. It really was the dream of my career, but unfortunately we will have to see who the next prime minister is.\u201d</p> <p>The former prisons minister, who had worked previously at DfID before he took over from Penny Mordaunt last month, said Johnson\u2019s stance on Europe would make it impossible to stay. Stewart, who has backed Johnson\u2019s rival Jeremy Hunt in the Conservative leadership contest, warned that a no-deal Brexit would make it harder for Britain to attain UN targets to lift people out of poverty.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, I wouldn\u2019t be able to remain in this job if Boris was prime minister,\u201d said Stewart. \u201cI don\u2019t think we he would want me, for a start, but it\u2019s also true that I\u2019m afraid on the very fundamental issue of the day, which is Brexit.</p> <p>\u201cI have said repeatedly that he is trying to deliver something that he can\u2019t deliver and he\u2019s going to disappoint people deeply. I wouldn\u2019t be able to be a member of a cabinet arguing for a policy that I think is misleading.\u201d</p> <p>Stewart was at Torriano primary school in Camden, north London, to face questions from schoolchildren and to talk about the UK\u2019s progress towards the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/sustainable-development-goals\">UN\u2019s global goals</a>. A <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uks-voluntary-national-review-of-the-sustainable-development-goals\">DfID review</a> said that while Britain has made \u201csignificant strides\u201d on the targets, much remained to be done \u2013&#xa0;particularly on the key UK priorities of reducing poverty and ensuring \u201cno one is left behind\u201d.</p> <p>Stewart said avoiding a no-deal Brexit was essential to achieving these goals.

      "bodyText": "Rory Stewart has said it would be \u201cheartbreaking\u201d to leave his job as international development secretary were Boris Johnson to become the next prime minister. Stewart, an anti no-deal candidate who was knocked out of the Tory leadership contest after last week after a television debate, has vowed not to serve in a Johnson cabinet. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the proudest I\u2019ve been. It\u2019s the greatest job I\u2019ve ever had in government. It\u2019s an amazing department that makes a huge difference around the world. And it\u2019s greatly admired. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with the Department for International Development in Iraq, Afghanistan going back over 15, 16 years. It really was the dream of my career, but unfortunately we will have to see who the next prime minister is.\u201d The former prisons minister, who had worked previously at DfID before he took over from Penny Mordaunt last month, said Johnson\u2019s stance on Europe would make it impossible to stay. Stewart, who has backed Johnson\u2019s rival Jeremy Hunt in the Conservative leadership contest, warned that a no-deal Brexit would make it harder for Britain to attain UN targets to lift people out of poverty. \u201cUnfortunately, I wouldn\u2019t be able to remain in this job if Boris was prime minister,\u201d said Stewart. \u201cI don\u2019t think we he would want me, for a start, but it\u2019s also true that I\u2019m afraid on the very fundamental issue of the day, which is Brexit. \u201cI have said repeatedly that he is trying to deliver something that he can\u2019t deliver and he\u2019s going to disappoint people deeply. I wouldn\u2019t be able to be a member of a cabinet arguing for a policy that I think is misleading.\u201d Stewart was at Torriano primary school in Camden, north London, to face questions from schoolchildren and to talk about the UK\u2019s progress towards the UN\u2019s global goals. A DfID review said that while Britain has made \u201csignificant strides\u201d on the targets, much remained to be done \u2013 particularly on the key UK priorities of reducing poverty and ensuring \u201cno one is left behind\u201d. Stewart said avoiding a no-deal Brexit was essential to achieving these goals. Asked how the government could better achieve its aim to reduce poverty, he said:\u201cFrom my point of view, we have to avoid a no-deal Brexit. It sounds like a daft thing to say, but I think the economic damage it would do would reduce the amount of money that we have available. If we can deliver a sensible solution to Brexit there should be \u00a326m or \u00a327m more available, and I would like to see that invested firstly in education, and we should put more into policing and the NHS.\u201d The international development secretary, who pledged to put the climate crisis and the environment at DfID\u2019s heart, said the world was at risk of becoming \u201cmuch more difficult and unpleasant\u201d within 50 years without sweeping changes in sustainability. Stewart said he expected Johnson to retain the 0.7% target of gross national income for overseas aid, and hoped DfID would remain a standalone department despite Johnson\u2019s previous suggestions that it should be brought into the Foreign Office. \u201cMy understanding is that Boris is committed to keeping 0.7% and that\u2019s really important, because there were candidates in this race that were trying to get rid of 0.7%. That is central, partly because climate and the environment is something that is so intermeshed in the way we think about development and poverty, and the scale of the challenge we\u2019re facing on climate and the environment is literally multiple trillions of pounds.\u201d Esther McVey, an early leadership candidate, has suggested the 0.7% target should be cut.

Stewart suggested that a charge of 1p for every bag of mixed waste would lead to more people recycling.

What\u2019s more, he sees the threat of a no-deal Brexit as key to winning last-minute concessions from Brussels. It follows that a Johnson government will be at pains to keep the option on the table.</p> \n<p>The problem? Despite Johnson\u2019s insistence that MPs are coming around to the idea, swathes of parliamentarians are passionately opposed and have promised to do whatever they can to stop it. But what can these MPs actually do to stop a no-deal Brexit?</p> \n<p>Speaking on the Today programme this morning, one-time leadership hopeful and now full-time Johnson backer, Dominic Raab, suggested that as prime minister Johnson could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/26/boris-johnson-could-ignore-efforts-to-block-no-deal-says-raab\" title=\"\">simply ignore</a> parliamentary efforts to stop no deal. He said any motion from MPs against a no-deal Brexit would have \u201czero legal effect\u201d and could be overridden.</p> \n<p>This is a view shared by many of Johnson\u2019s parliamentary supporters. They argue that although parliament could vote for numerous motions calling on Johnson to try and extend article 50 or rule out a no deal, he could ignore them. Even a censure motion in which MPs could vote to dock the prime minister\u2019s pay in protest at his decision to keep no deal on the table could have little effect. It\u2019s hardly the case that Johnson is short of funds or likely to be embarrassed.</p> \n<p>Johnson supporters argue that unlike Theresa May, he is really prepared to go for no deal. As one cabinet minister said to me: \u201cThe problem with no deal last time was not that MPs would not do it, it was that the prime minister would not do it.\u201d There\u2019s a view that May didn\u2019t really fight the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/27/from-a-labour-deal-to-a-jobs-fund-amendments-to-third-brexit-motion\" title=\"\">Cooper/Letwin amendment</a> forcing the government to seek an article 50 extension as much as she could have.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b146305d-32c1-4dc9-9f4d-b60ce025264f\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal it would by default, become a \u201cthird country\u201d, with no overarching post-Brexit plan in place and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.</p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europeif there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>If a motion failed, there is the drastic option of a vote of no confidence in the government. If a majority of MPs voted against the government, it would fall. Unless a new government could be formed, an election would follow. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess as to how the Commons would then stop no deal \u2013 but if the UK had a general election, there\u2019s an expectation that Brussels would grant a brief extension in a bid to allow the matter to be resolved.</p> \n<p>Are there the numbers?

      "bodyText": "What can MPs do to stop a no-deal Brexit? With Boris Johnson insisting that as prime minister he would take the UK out of the EU by the end of October \u201cdo or die\u201d, it\u2019s a question that will be asked frequently in the coming months. If \u2013 as expected \u2013 Johnson enters No 10 next month, he will have little time to try to negotiate a new Brexit deal with the EU. What\u2019s more, he sees the threat of a no-deal Brexit as key to winning last-minute concessions from Brussels. It follows that a Johnson government will be at pains to keep the option on the table. The problem? Despite Johnson\u2019s insistence that MPs are coming around to the idea, swathes of parliamentarians are passionately opposed and have promised to do whatever they can to stop it. But what can these MPs actually do to stop a no-deal Brexit? Speaking on the Today programme this morning, one-time leadership hopeful and now full-time Johnson backer, Dominic Raab, suggested that as prime minister Johnson could simply ignore parliamentary efforts to stop no deal. He said any motion from MPs against a no-deal Brexit would have \u201czero legal effect\u201d and could be overridden. This is a view shared by many of Johnson\u2019s parliamentary supporters. They argue that although parliament could vote for numerous motions calling on Johnson to try and extend article 50 or rule out a no deal, he could ignore them. Even a censure motion in which MPs could vote to dock the prime minister\u2019s pay in protest at his decision to keep no deal on the table could have little effect. It\u2019s hardly the case that Johnson is short of funds or likely to be embarrassed. Johnson supporters argue that unlike Theresa May, he is really prepared to go for no deal. As one cabinet minister said to me: \u201cThe problem with no deal last time was not that MPs would not do it, it was that the prime minister would not do it.\u201d There\u2019s a view that May didn\u2019t really fight the Cooper/Letwin amendment forcing the government to seek an article 50 extension as much as she could have. If a motion failed, there is the drastic option of a vote of no confidence in the government. If a majority of MPs voted against the government, it would fall. Unless a new government could be formed, an election would follow. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess as to how the Commons would then stop no deal \u2013 but if the UK had a general election, there\u2019s an expectation that Brussels would grant a brief extension in a bid to allow the matter to be resolved. Are there the numbers? Both Amber Rudd and Tobias Ellwood say that they know of enough Tory MPs who would vote against the government if the timing was right. However, both have ruled it out as something they themselves would do on the grounds that it would be a step too far for them to vote down their own government. The only two Tory MPs to publicly say they would do just this are Ken Clarke and Dominic Grieve. With deselection threats against various pro-EU Tory MPs it could be that more MPs surface \u2013 concluding they have little to lose. There would need to be more given that a handful of leave-backing Labour MPs could abstain or prove helpful in the vote as a way to deliver Brexit. It follows that any Labour plots to hold a confidence vote before the summer holidays begin \u2013 as soon as the new prime minister takes office \u2013 would likely be premature. Most Tory MPs on the brink say they would only consider it if they believed every avenue had been exhausted and there was no chance of a Brexit deal. Johnson allies believe that the highest chance there is of such a vote succeeding would be in the autumn, when everything is clearer on Brexit.

At the expense of our humanity, not to the benefit of our safety.\u201d Fellow 2020 hopeful senator Kamala Harris condemned the picture as \u201ca stain on our moral conscience\u201d. She wrote: \u201cThese families seeking asylum are often fleeing extreme violence. And what happens when they arrive? Trump says, \u2018Go back to where you came from.\u2019 That is inhumane. Children are dying.\u201d Corey Booker, New Jersey senator and 2020 candidate, also blamed the president. \u201cWe should not look away. These are the consequences of Donald Trump\u2019s inhumane and immoral immigration policy. This is being done in our name,\u201d he tweeted. At a town hall in Miami on Tuesday night, Elizabeth Warren talked about her distressing experience visiting a detention centre in McCallen, Texas, last year, which she compared to a \u201cgiant Amazon warehouse\u201d full of cages full of people. Responding to a request by an audience member, she agreed to visit Homestead detention centre in Florida ahead of the first televised Democrat debate in Miami. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to Homestead tomorrow, come with me,\u201d she said, bringing audience members to their feet. To cheers she called for \u201cmore aid\u201d for central America and help to stabilize those countries and better treatment for those who cross the border into the US. \u201cTreat the people who come here with the dignity and kindness that marks the United States of America,\u201d she said. But frontrunners Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders so far appear to have remained silent on the issue. Trump did not comment directly on the picture, but used the opportunity to criticize the Democrats over their border policies, making a series of untrue claims. \u201cToo bad the Dems in Congress won\u2019t do anything at all about Border Security,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThey want Open Borders, which means crime. But we are getting it done, including building the Wall! More people than ever before are coming because the USA Economy is so good, the best in history.\u201d He added in a second tweet: \u201cDemocrats want Open Borders, which equals violent crime, drugs and human trafficking. They also want very high taxes, like 90%. Republicans want what\u2019s good for America \u2013 the exact opposite!\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 27 June 2019 to correct the spelling of Alan Kurdi\u2019s name.",

      "bodyText": "I am now 68 years of age but when I was 21, in my final year at university, I became aware of major problems then facing the world \u2013 war, poverty, acid rain, ozone depletion, desertification, deforestation, species loss, civil and military uses and abuses of nuclear power, pollution, population growth, consumerism and the climate crisis. I was determined to devote my life to helping solve these problems. After spending three years in Cameroon, learning about deforestation for timber and cash crops such as palm oil, and the exploitation of the rich resources of Africa to the detriment of locals and enrichment of corporations and western societies, I returned home to the nuclear weapons crisis of the cold war. I joined the Greenham Common protests, founded the Snowball civil disobedience campaign and then later the anti-nuclear weapons group Trident Ploughshares. I also became involved in work on the climate crisis. I learned that everything is connected and that it all has an impact on the climate, on biodiversity and on the sustainability of life on Earth. I discovered more about how our reliance on fossil fuels was causing the greenhouse effect and soon joined with climate scientists and local environmentalists to start a group in Norwich that tried to educate the public. We put up maps showing how much of East Anglia and London would be under water as temperatures soared and the sea levels rose. This was in the early 1980s. We concentrated on what individuals could do to lower their carbon footprints \u2013 by putting up solar panels, changing lightbulbs, practising recycling and re-use, eating less meat, using public transport, shopping carefully and locally, and consuming less. After discovering the impact that UK timber imports were having on the loss of old-growth forests and their biodiversity, I even got involved in carbon sinks and sustainable forest management.

Langa Methodist Church Choir (Pyramid stage, 11.00, Sunday) If you\u2019re feeling a bit special by Sunday morning, it\u2019s raining and you just want to drive to the nearest Harvester, this lot will get you back in the game. Even the most godless will have their souls soothed by the sweeping, swelling power of this Cape Town choir, backed by simple drumming. The Love Unlimited Synth Orchestra (The Park stage, 15.15, Saturday) Had Barry White lived long enough, he would have made the perfect Sunday legend slot. But this year has the next best thing: recreations of the lush orchestral backings of his Love Unlimited Orchestra by the British Paraorchestra \u2013 made up of disabled performers \u2013 and a host of synth players.

Yola (Avalon stage, 13.55, Sunday; BBC Music Introducing, 18.00, Sunday) With a voice that could carry across the whole of Worthy Farm, and excellent Dan Auerbach-produced songs to do it justice, Yola \u2013 from just down the road in Bristol \u2013 should by rights be massive. See her at close quarters before she inevitably ends up that way. The jazz takeovers In addition to individual sets, a number of London\u2019s boldest jazz collectives will face off in h2h smackdowns over the weekend: the Wormhole has the Comet Is Coming v Steam Down (00.00, Friday), Ezra Collective vs Sons of Kemet (00.00, Saturday) and Kokoroko v Joe Armon-Jones (00.00, Sunday), while London\u2019s jazz space Total Refreshment Centre takes over the Stonebridge Bar (16.00 \u2013 midnight, Friday) with the Steam Down Soundsystem, Emma-Jean Thackray, Emma Warren and more.

      "bodyText": "A far-right extremist has confessed to murdering a pro-refugee German politician who was found dead outside his house on 2 June having been shot in the head. Stephan Ernst, a 45-year-old German man with a string of convictions for violent anti-migrant crime, was arrested two weeks after the murder of Walter L\u00fcbcke, 65. Police had matched Ernst\u2019s DNA with evidence recovered from the scene of the crime. The German interior minister, Horst Seehofer, said on Wednesday that Ernst had confessed to what Seehofer called a \u201cpolitical murder\u201d and that the hunt was still on for possible accomplices. Ernst reportedly said L\u00fcbcke\u2019s pro-refugee stance was his motive. L\u00fcbcke, a member of Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats (CDU), was well known as a champion of refugees in Germany. He had previously received death threats due to his stance. Ernst admitted being incensed by L\u00fcbcke\u2019s comments at a town hall meeting in October 2015, Spiegel Online reported. At the meeting, held to discuss a new asylum seeker shelter, as hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees entered the country, L\u00fcbcke reportedly said: \u201cOne has to stand up for values here. And those who don\u2019t do so can leave this country any time, if they don\u2019t like it. That\u2019s the freedom of every German.\u201d It is not clear whether Ernst attended the meeting, but a video of L\u00fcbcke\u2019s comments was reportedly circulated in far-right forums and was mentioned at rallies by the anti-immigration Pegida movement at the height of the migration crisis. Investigators believe Ernst had contact with the far-right NPD party, as well as the neo-Nazi group Combat 18, whose members are known for promoting violence, hoarding weapons and spreading far-right propaganda and bomb-making guides. He served a prison sentence after attempting to plant a pipe bomb outside a home for asylum seekers in 1993. He was arrested 10 years ago at a neo-Nazi march in Dortmund and sentenced to seven months\u2019 probation for breaching the peace. Extremists and neo-Nazis have posted messages online appearing to applaud L\u00fcbcke\u2019s murder, stoking fears that a wider networkcould have been involved in the killing. The killing has deeply shaken Germany and raised questions about whether the country has failed to take seriously a rising threat from neo-Nazis. Ernst has claimed he acted alone, but Seehofer said investigators would continue to hunt for possible accomplices or co-conspirators. \u201cThe investigation of this political murder is not yet complete,\u201d Seehofer said. He promised to \u201cdo everything humanly possible to investigate this terrible act\u201d, adding: \u201cWe will continue to work hard to establish whether there were accessories or even accomplices.

      "body": "<h2>EUROPE</h2> <h2>Porto</h2> <p><strong>Taste Porto</strong>\u2019s tours are rooted in fundamental beliefs about the gastronomic scene in Portugal\u2019s second city. First, Portuenses like to keep things simple: so, no fusion experiments. Second, it\u2019s as much about the people behind the food, as the food itself. \u201cFood is an expression of culture,\u201d says US-born Carly Petracco, who founded Taste Porto in 2013 with her Porto-born husband Miguel and his childhood buddy Andr\u00e9. \u201cWe like to show who\u2019s doing the cooking, who\u2019s serving the food, who\u2019s supplying the ingredients, and so on.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019s good to her word. Walking the city with one of the six guides feels less like venue-hopping and more like dropping in for a catch-up with a series of food-loving, old friends. Everywhere you go (whether it\u2019s the <a href=\"http://www.alojadospasteisdechaves.pt/\" title=\"\">Loja dos Past\u00e9is de Chaves</a> cafe with its flaky pastries or the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Restaurante-Flor-dos-Congregados-303833413049462/\" title=\"\">Flor de Congregados</a> sandwich bar with its sublime slow-roasted pork special) the experience is as convivial as it is culinary. And it\u2019s not just food either. Taste Porto runs a Vintage Tour option that includes a final stop at boutique wine store, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tourigavinhosdeportugal\" title=\"\">Touriga</a>, where the owner David will willingly pair your palate to the perfect port.<br>\u2022<em> </em><em>Tours from \u20ac59pp, tours last 3-3\u00bd hours, <a href=\"https://www.tasteporto.com/\" title=\"\">tasteporto.com</a></em><br><strong>Oliver Balch</strong></p> <h2>Lisbon</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"349f0528515a0db2db842feffc412cfde2cb46a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/349f0528515a0db2db842feffc412cfde2cb46a1/0_0_951_571/500.jpg\" alt=\"Lisbon Penalva Da Graca\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>A single espresso first thing on an empty stomach is the secret to a long and healthy life. So says 93-year-old Carlos Pina, whose father founded coffee roastery <a href=\"http://www.cafesnegrita.pt/\" title=\"\">Negrita</a> in 1924 and who still works there. One of only two roasteries left in Lisbon, Negrita is in a former stables in the Gra\u00e7a neighbourhood and has survived because the family own the building: elsewhere across the city rising rents are forcing decades-old businesses to close.</p> <p>Gra\u00e7a and neighbouring Mouraria are still home to families who shop in local stores, making the two neighbourhoods ideal for <strong>Culinary Backstreets</strong>: its food tours aim to give visitors an insight into the city\u2019s history and culture. After breathing in the scent of coffee and roasted spices at Negrita, the tour takes in a traditional <em>cerveceria</em> for plates of clams, velvet crab and <em>prego</em> (steak sandwich). Then there\u2019s a shot of cherry liqueur at a local corner store and a takeaway grilled chicken eaten in the no-nonsense bar of a neighbourhood association \u2013 <a href=\"https://culinarybackstreets.com/cities-category/lisbon/2018/lisbon/\" title=\"\">another fast-disappearing feature of old Lisbon</a>.</p> <p>A contrast to these insights into old Lisbon is tiny <a href=\"https://atabernadomar.negocio.site/\" title=\"\">A Taberna do Mar</a>, which opened in 2018 opposite the church and convent of Gra\u00e7a. Here chef-owner Filipe Rodrigues combines his love of Japanese techniques, Portuguese produce and a passion for sustainability to create inventive dishes. Try samples of horse mackerel bone broth and smoked sashimi of yellow fin tuna. Even the pudding, based on traditional egg custard, has a hint of sardine.

While cruising around, admire the wedding-cake architecture built during the 20th-century sugar boom and sate savoury cravings as Tanja introduces you to her favourite hamburger joint.<br>\u2022 <em>\u00a3103 for 2-8 people, excluding transport and snacks, </em><em>contact Tanja.Buwalda at gmail.com</em><br><strong>CB</strong></p> <h2>SOUTH AMERICA</h2> <h2>Lima</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c4b5abf57fab57ece879f492437b5aabf8272a8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4b5abf57fab57ece879f492437b5aabf8272a8b/0_202_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Freddy Alarc\u00f3n offering a few tips on how to make a great ceviche at the back of his food truck La Combi Roja in Callao, Peru.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Freddy Alarc\u00f3n offering a few tips on how to make a great ceviche at the back of his food truck La Combi Roja in Callao, Peru.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paola Ugaz</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you are looking for a way to make an already exciting food scene even more edgy try the <strong>Ruta del Callao</strong> gastro tour. Callao is Lima\u2019s port, and has its own flavour (musically it prefers salsa to cumb\u00eda) and though it has some of the city\u2019s most crime-ridden neighbourhoods \u2013 it also has some of its most lip-smacking seafood. Callao is one of the best spots on Peru\u2019s 2,414km coastline to eat ceviche, and Freddy Alarc\u00f3n\u2019s Combi Roja (red van) is one of <em>the</em> places to try Peru\u2019s flagship dish. Freddy has been cooking on wheels for more than 30 years. With ready smile he can prepare a hake ceviche at lightning speed and diners can sit and eat in the specially adapted van on fake leather seats.</p> <p>Next stop is El Colorao de Chucuito, run by Andr\u00e9s Angeles, a former merchant marine who has created 20 of his own dishes. His specialities are <em>muchame de at\u00fan</em>, layers of dried tuna fish served with avocado and olive oil, and swordfish in sea snail sauce. In Callao all roads lead to La Punta, a peninsula that juts out into the Pacific, lined with pastel-hued art-deco homes. At its end is Don Giuseppe\u2019s eponymous eatery, owned by an older Genoa-born seaman who met his love on the Peruvian coast and decided to stay. His restaurant is famous for its <em>pan con pejerrey,</em> a crispy fried fish sandwich. Returning from the furthest point of the tour stop off at Kala Tanta, a bakery run by social entrepreneurs Andr\u00e9s Ugaz and Gaby Wuest who created the tour.

Colombians have started appreciating the natural bounty of the world\u2019s second-most biodiverse country and flock to the city\u2019s best-stocked mercado.</p> <p>Street-food kiosks serving local dishes have also grown in popularity and, besides trying a rainbow assortment of sweet natural treats at the Fruti Fruti stand, Juliana gives the lowdown on dishes made by Paloquemao\u2019s finest purveyors. Do\u00f1a Aurora\u2019s chicken and \u201cmeat\u201d <em>tamal tolimense</em> (from Tolima) is described as great hangover fodder, while warm cheesy <em>pandebono</em> rolls and <em>avena</em> (a chilled oatmeal and vanilla drink) are breakfast staples at Pandebonitos de la virgen. Paloquemao\u2019s street-food queen, however, is Do\u00f1a Rosalba; on Sundays, she sells 2,000 portions of <em>lechona</em>, slow-cooked pork with dried peas and rice that are mixed back into the hog and served with crackling and a white corn arepa.

Besides pushing waistline boundaries with abundant servings of meat, this three-hour walking tour also opens the doors to unexpected Buenos Aires corners, revealing low-profile but authentic bodegones (taverns) and steakhouses in Palermo and San Telmo.</p> <p>The first mouthful is legendary Argentine hot sausage sandwich <em>chorip\u00e1n</em>, taken at 120-year-old La Ca\u00f1ita, a former store dating back to when sugar cane grew in this neighbourhood.

Next is pizzeria <a href=\"https://www.laguitarrita.com.ar/#\" title=\"\">La Guitarrita</a> (though it also serves empanadas).

      "bodyText": "EUROPE Porto Taste Porto\u2019s tours are rooted in fundamental beliefs about the gastronomic scene in Portugal\u2019s second city. First, Portuenses like to keep things simple: so, no fusion experiments. Second, it\u2019s as much about the people behind the food, as the food itself. \u201cFood is an expression of culture,\u201d says US-born Carly Petracco, who founded Taste Porto in 2013 with her Porto-born husband Miguel and his childhood buddy Andr\u00e9. \u201cWe like to show who\u2019s doing the cooking, who\u2019s serving the food, who\u2019s supplying the ingredients, and so on.\u201d She\u2019s good to her word. Walking the city with one of the six guides feels less like venue-hopping and more like dropping in for a catch-up with a series of food-loving, old friends. Everywhere you go (whether it\u2019s the Loja dos Past\u00e9is de Chaves cafe with its flaky pastries or the Flor de Congregados sandwich bar with its sublime slow-roasted pork special) the experience is as convivial as it is culinary. And it\u2019s not just food either. Taste Porto runs a Vintage Tour option that includes a final stop at boutique wine store, Touriga, where the owner David will willingly pair your palate to the perfect port. \u2022 Tours from \u20ac59pp, tours last 3-3\u00bd hours, tasteporto.com Oliver Balch Lisbon A single espresso first thing on an empty stomach is the secret to a long and healthy life. So says 93-year-old Carlos Pina, whose father founded coffee roastery Negrita in 1924 and who still works there. One of only two roasteries left in Lisbon, Negrita is in a former stables in the Gra\u00e7a neighbourhood and has survived because the family own the building: elsewhere across the city rising rents are forcing decades-old businesses to close. Gra\u00e7a and neighbouring Mouraria are still home to families who shop in local stores, making the two neighbourhoods ideal for Culinary Backstreets: its food tours aim to give visitors an insight into the city\u2019s history and culture. After breathing in the scent of coffee and roasted spices at Negrita, the tour takes in a traditional cerveceria for plates of clams, velvet crab and prego (steak sandwich). Then there\u2019s a shot of cherry liqueur at a local corner store and a takeaway grilled chicken eaten in the no-nonsense bar of a neighbourhood association \u2013 another fast-disappearing feature of old Lisbon. A contrast to these insights into old Lisbon is tiny A Taberna do Mar, which opened in 2018 opposite the church and convent of Gra\u00e7a. Here chef-owner Filipe Rodrigues combines his love of Japanese techniques, Portuguese produce and a passion for sustainability to create inventive dishes. Try samples of horse mackerel bone broth and smoked sashimi of yellow fin tuna. Even the pudding, based on traditional egg custard, has a hint of sardine. At \u20ac25 the 10-course tasting menu is a bargain and worth booking if you have another night in the city. \u2022 \u20ac115, tour lasts around 6 hours, culinarybackstreets.com Isabel Choat Berlin An influx of creative talent and relatively affordable startup costs have meant the German capital\u2019s restaurant scene has boomed in recent years. Per Meurling, the Swedish founder of Berlin Food Stories, and Liv Fleischhacker, a food writer and founder of Nosh Berlin, the city\u2019s only Jewish food festival, are here to help sift through the glut of dining options. Tours kick off at Markthalle Neun, a refurbished food hall in the Kreuzberg area, and encompass everything from a look at Berlin\u2019s thriving Turkish diaspora \u2013 with a stop for d\u00f6ner kebabs and other signature staples, of course \u2013 to German classics, such as eisbein (pickled ham hock) and k\u00f6nigsberger klopse (veal meatballs in cream sauce) at Max &amp; Moritz. The guides take turns leading tours but each offers insights on how the city\u2019s history has helped shape its gastronomic present. \u2022 \u20ac90pp, tours 3\u00bd hours, berlinfoodstories.com Diana Hubbell Barcelona More than mere culinary tours, Devour Barcelona\u2019s small-group sojourns dive into the history and culture of the city \u2013 and steer travellers towards lesser-known local haunts. On a morning stroll on the Tastes &amp; Traditions of Barcelona tour, visitors skip the hordes at Mercat de la Boqueria in favour of a more civilised breakfast of charcuterie, cheeses and cava at Bar Joan at Mercado de Santa Caterina. After more stops in the El Born neighbourhood, the tour winds toward Barceloneta for vermouth and bombas (meat-and-potato croquettes) at Bodega La Peninsular and squid ink-stained paella at Can Ramonet. In the evening, the Tapas, Taverns &amp; History tour delves into everything from the Spanish inquisition to the city war. The exact stops vary depending on the guide but may include a visit to Bodega La Palma for cider-braised pork cheeks or a glass of red straight from the barrel with flash-fried anchovies and cumin-scented butifarra sausage at La Plata, a barebones tapas joint that was a favourite of the late Anthony Bourdain. \u2022 Tours from \u20ac79pp, tours last 2\u00bd to 3\u00bd hours, devourbarcelonafoodtours.com DH Copenhagen The first thing visitors note about Copenhagen is the vast number of bicycles: 43% of all commutes are done by bike. So, it is not surprising that visitors want to explore the city by bike, too. If you master the art of pedalling you should give Foods of Copenhagen\u2019s culinary bike tour a spin as it involves exploring the less touristy areas of N\u00f8rrebro and Refshale\u00f8en. Cindie Christiansen founded the company three years ago and she takes guests to the hippest places in town. A tour might include modern, open-faced sandwiches at Selma, desserts at Winterspring, hotdogs from Kejser Sausage at the Bridge Street Kitchen and fermented potato fries at Tapperiet Brus. It also includes local drinks, such as Nordic ciders at R\u00f8dder &amp; Vin. Christiansen chooses places carefully, mixing street food and fine dining. All the food on the tour is consumed sitting down and eating a full dish rather than tastings. This makes for a longer tour but also for in-depth knowledge and a more sociable experience. \u2022 \u00a3144pp including bike rental (which is yours for the full day), foodsofcopenhagen.com Andrea Bak Naples Despite its history and culinary traditions, an outdated reputation keeps Naples off some travellers\u2019 Italian itineraries. Yet, Culinary Backstreets\u2019 tour \u2013 one of the newest among the company\u2019s global offerings \u2013 illustrates just how much there is to discover in this hypnotic city. The tour begins outside the old city walls in Porta Capuana with a mid-morning espresso, rum baba and sweet, ricotta-filled sfogliatelle. Next up is a third-generation baccaleria for samples of salt cod, a \u201chealing\u201d glass of sulphuric water from Vesuvius, and a bruschetta-like snack in the city\u2019s last traditional friselle bakery. The 10 stops on the five-hour tour offer much more than quick bites and photo-ops. The guides have fostered relationships with the bakers, vendors, and cooks who make this food scene unique, and this allows rare peeks into bakers\u2019 ovens and chats with artisans. A stroll among the buzzing stalls of a local market highlights a slice of Naples in an area many visitors are unlikely to see. The tour also hits the \u201cmust-sees\u201d \u2013 perfect for those on a tight schedule who don\u2019t want to miss tasting a Sorbillo pizza or a shot of limoncello. \u2022 \u20ac107pp, tour 5 hours, culinarybackstreets.com Will Vibert Palermo The Duchess of Palma \u2013 Nicoletta Lanza Tomasi \u2013 has a crash course in Sicilian cuisine and it begins with a tour of Palermo\u2019s Mercado del Capo. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise I knew so much about the city\u2019s history until I started teaching my cooking class to fund the upkeep of the palace,\u201d she says, working between her favourite spice merchant, fishmonger, shouty fruit and veg traders and stalls stacked with bags of pasta. Part food tour, part cooking masterclass, Cooking with the Duchess delves deep into the way Palermitans have eaten for centuries, from the Arab traders that first set up Mercado del Capo 1,000 years ago to the Jewish, Normans and Greeks that made this city the street-food capital of Europe. It also ends at Nicoletta\u2019s home, the cacti-lined 18th-century Palazzo Lanza Tomasi \u2013 a palace on the city\u2019s seafront, where the Duke\u2019s father, author Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa, once sat to write the iconic novel, Il Gattopardo (The Leopard). \u201cI have always cooked traditional, Sicilian dishes to preserve the heritage of the island,\u201d says Nicoletta. The four-course menu changes seasonally but street-food inspired chickpea panelle, swordfish rolls and almond and pistachio pesto ruvidelli are examples of the recipes you can get hands on with in the palace kitchen, between herb foraging on the jasmine-laced terrazza and glasses of Sicilian wine. Then on to a tour of the palace and lunch with the Duke and Duchess in the grand banqueting hall. \u2022 \u20ac146, butera28.it Anastasia Miari ASIA Shanghai Untour\u2019s street eats breakfast tour starts with a tasting of three of Shanghai\u2019s four most popular breakfast foods, collectively known as the \u201cfour heavenly kings\u201d. There are crispy, oily, fried youtiao doughnuts, which are dipped into a freshly made sweetened soy milk that also helps wash down a dense cifantuan rice ball. This stodgy-and-satisfying Shanghainese dish combines white and red sticky rice, stuffed with salted duck egg and tart mustard pickles. These are enjoyed at Xiangcai Renjia, a Hunan-style restaurant that, in the morning, doubles as a breakfast joint, making use of the free seating to serve food made by the owners of the food stall next door. Next, the tour moves to the Xiangyang Road area of the Former French Concession, where visitors can sample pancakes, steamed buns and dumplings, all served from tiny holes in the wall. The classic jianbing, or Chinese crepe, is a fitting substitute for the sesame pancake that is traditionally the fourth \u201cheavenly\u201d breakfast item. Jianbing, which is best enjoyed straight off the griddle folded around egg, fried wonton skin, pickles and spicy sauce, can be traced back 2,000 years to north-east China but is now popular across the country as an on-the-go breakfast. Elsewhere, in a tiny sit-down place next door to the jianbing stall, there are rich and flavoursome pork-filled soup dumplings, served in a traditional bamboo steamer. Of course, breakfast in a city as cosmopolitan as Shanghai isn\u2019t all about tradition: trendy coffee shops also serve western-style choices with Chinese characteristics. At Egg, a cafe on nearby Xiangyang North Road, taste the brownie topped with peanut and numbing Sichuan peppercorns for a tingly, sweet contrast to the morning\u2019s savoury carb feast. \u2022 \u00a360pp, tour 3 hours, untourfoodtours.com Tess Humphrys Hong Kong Despite its name, there is more to Little Adventures\u2019 Wonton-a-thon tour than just a sampling of Hong Kong\u2019s iconic dumplings. Each itinerary is tailored to the tastes of the guests, and could include succulent roast goose or deftly carved duck; a dazzling array of dim sum in an old-school tea house; a jarring shot of snake wine; or learning the finer points of oolong appreciation with a celebrated tea master. Stops on recent tours include Lin Heung Kui and its array of morsels served from trolley-mounted steam tables and sizzling grills, or For Kee, a quintessential cha chaan teng, the Hong Kong equivalent of a greasy spoon diner, known for its pork chops. The tour is narrated by a member of the Little Adventures team, which includes founder and journalist Daisann McLane, a local chef, and some noted food writers. The guides are Cantonese-speaking culinary experts who beyond their infectious enthusiasm for the foods of the Fragrant Harbour \u2013 Hong Kong in Cantonese \u2013 share their encyclopaedic knowledge of the city they live in and love. \u2022 \u00a3125pp for half-day tour for a group of three. littleadventuresinhongkong.com Vincent Vichit-Vadakan Bangkok Skip the gloopy stir-fried noodles on the tourist-trap of Khao San Road and explore the intricacies of Thai cuisine with Chili Paste Tour\u2019s Chin Chongtong, a charismatic guide who has called Bangkok home for more than 15 years.

A short saunter across is Mumbai\u2019s oldest surviving eatery, Pancham Puriwala, a magnet for migrant labourers drawn to its fluffy puris and gravied potatoes. In cacophonous Crawford Market, a five-minute walk away, is Badshah, serving its falooda (a colourful jumble of ice-cream, vermicelli noodles, jelly, rose syrup, nuts and basil seeds), the perfect cold drink for sun-charred Mumbai. Nearby is Kyani &amp;Co, Mumbai\u2019s oldest Irani cafe, specialising in all manner of meaty Parsi comestibles from masala-flecked mince to chicken patties to mutton cheese omelettes. Then onwards to Parsi Dairy Farm on Princess Street, purveyors of creamy kulfi (a sort of ice-cream made by simmering creamy milk for hours) and ghee-drenched sweetmeats. On Chowpatty beach, honeycombed with food shacks, taste pao bhaji: mashed vegetables in a bath of butter, and bhel (potatoes, onions, puri, puffed rice, with a wash of sweet-sour and spicy chutneys), and a dusting of sev (hair-thin strands of fried chickpea flour) on top. Those more stern of stomach can visit the nearby restaurant Soam for the same dishes in more salubrious, air-conditioned environs. Then to the Babulnath dosa vendor for cheese-slicked dosa and spring \u201cChinese\u201d dosa, the latter stuffed with capsicum, carrots, and skewered with soy and spicy schezwan sauce.

Today, little of that history remains but it has become known for its maze of narrow alleys, home to squat postwar buildings and the tiny restaurants, bars and cafes they contain. The night-time tour by Tokyo Memories through the neighbourhood is led by Simon Berry, an Englishman who\u2019s lived in Sangenjaya for the last decade. Berry guide guests through a couple of favourites: Takomasu, a street-side takoyaki (fried octopus ball) stall that sells takoyaki \u201csandwiches\u201d; Ogata, where guests make monjayaki, a cabbage-filled pancake. Then it\u2019s into the alleys, to Omasu, a kushikatsu restaurant owned by baseball fanatic Yoshi-san (kushikatsu is deep fried skewers of meat and vegetables). It\u2019s easy to get lost in these alleys but Berry navigates them confidently to Kiura, a sake bar behind a sliding door disguised as a shop\u2019s back wall. After the oil-heavy kushikatsu, it\u2019s a welcome change and a strong finish to the tour. The sake is refreshingly light and the food menu stretches from sashimi to a plate of lightly boiled, garlic-covered edamame. \u2022 \u00a3100pp, tour 4 hours, tokyo-memories.com Oscar Boyd Vientiane, Laos When the French settled into Vientiane amid the heat on the middle Mekong in 1893, they puffed on opium, before a smoking ban reignited colonial passion and planning.

Of particular note are her tours of Greenpoint, a historically Polish neighbourhood on the northern Brooklyn waterfront, in which participants swing by Acme Smoked Fish Factory, which is only open to the public one day a week, and Pyza, a traditional restaurant serving cheese blintzes worthy of a Polish grandmother. \u2022 $54pp, tours from 3 hours, noshwalks.com DH Mexico City This city of eternal spring almost never sees a day without sun, so what better way to take a taco tour than by bicycle. El Taco Club leads small groups (up to 10) through the parks, art-deco buildings and colourful markets of the city\u2019s chic Roma, Condesa and Polanco neighbourhoods to find delicious tacos at hole-in- the-wall taquerias and street stands. The tour, which varies according to season and day of the week, might include a restaurant where patrons are serenaded by strolling musicians, offering a speciality of central Mexico, barbacoa, which is tender mutton wrapped in agave leaves and roasted in its own juices in an outdoor pit. Or a market stall serving cochinita pibil: slow-cooked suckling pig from the Yucatan marinated in a crimson chilli and achiote paste. A small street stand prepares brisket, tender enough to make any grandmother proud. And simple tacos done with tortillas made of fast disappearing heirloom varieties of corn and organic, locally grown avocados can be sampled at star chef Enrique Olvera\u2019s Molino el Pujol. A visit to a traditional cantina is included to top the journey with a beer or mezcal. \u2022 \u00a348pp, includes folding bikes, helmets, food and beverages, tour 3 hours, eltaco.club Nicholas Gilman Havana Taste for sugar in Cuba \u2013 a nation once rich from selling the sweet stuff \u2013 is embedded in the locals\u2019 DNA. From ice-cream to milkshakes, churros and coconut delicacies to coffee sunk with teaspoons of crystals, and cakes fashioned in neon meringue, embrace the island\u2019s candy choices. Irish-born Cubaphile Tanja Buwalda moved to Havana 10 years ago after running a restaurant in Cork. Starting a food blog to recount her travels and Cuban food experiences, she now runs food tours explaining how and where food comes from in Cuba, dual-currency hacks, how private front-room restaurants (paladares) source ingredients, and Cuba\u2019s organic food revolution. With Tanja, you\u2019ll learn as much about Cuba\u2019s contemporary food issues as you will about what the locals snack on. Try coffee from Habaneros\u2019 windows \u2013 an espresso will cost 3p and will probably be dredged in sugar for Cuban tastes \u2013 slurp intense guarapo (sugarcane juice), and hunt for the best cookies, and creamy mamey milkshakes, across the city. While cruising around, admire the wedding-cake architecture built during the 20th-century sugar boom and sate savoury cravings as Tanja introduces you to her favourite hamburger joint. \u2022 \u00a3103 for 2-8 people, excluding transport and snacks, contact Tanja.Buwalda at gmail.com CB SOUTH AMERICA Lima If you are looking for a way to make an already exciting food scene even more edgy try the Ruta del Callao gastro tour. Callao is Lima\u2019s port, and has its own flavour (musically it prefers salsa to cumb\u00eda) and though it has some of the city\u2019s most crime-ridden neighbourhoods \u2013 it also has some of its most lip-smacking seafood. Callao is one of the best spots on Peru\u2019s 2,414km coastline to eat ceviche, and Freddy Alarc\u00f3n\u2019s Combi Roja (red van) is one of the places to try Peru\u2019s flagship dish. Freddy has been cooking on wheels for more than 30 years. With ready smile he can prepare a hake ceviche at lightning speed and diners can sit and eat in the specially adapted van on fake leather seats. Next stop is El Colorao de Chucuito, run by Andr\u00e9s Angeles, a former merchant marine who has created 20 of his own dishes. His specialities are muchame de at\u00fan, layers of dried tuna fish served with avocado and olive oil, and swordfish in sea snail sauce. In Callao all roads lead to La Punta, a peninsula that juts out into the Pacific, lined with pastel-hued art-deco homes. At its end is Don Giuseppe\u2019s eponymous eatery, owned by an older Genoa-born seaman who met his love on the Peruvian coast and decided to stay. His restaurant is famous for its pan con pejerrey, a crispy fried fish sandwich. Returning from the furthest point of the tour stop off at Kala Tanta, a bakery run by social entrepreneurs Andr\u00e9s Ugaz and Gaby Wuest who created the tour. Learn to make bread and see how promoting Callao\u2019s gastronomy is tackling crime and youth unemployment. \u2022 To take the tour contact gabyseptember at yahoo.com or call +51 943209365, the tour takes 4 hours and departs from 10 hotels across Lima Dan Collyns Bogot\u00e1 \u201cThis is where Bogot\u00e1\u2019s top chefs come shopping,\u201d says Foodies Colombia guide and chef Juliana Salazar, browsing Paloquemao market\u2019s stalls for fruity tropical bounties such as guan\u00e1bana (soursop), feijoa, pitahaya (dragonfruit) and lulo piled up in perfect pyramids. Colombians have started appreciating the natural bounty of the world\u2019s second-most biodiverse country and flock to the city\u2019s best-stocked mercado. Street-food kiosks serving local dishes have also grown in popularity and, besides trying a rainbow assortment of sweet natural treats at the Fruti Fruti stand, Juliana gives the lowdown on dishes made by Paloquemao\u2019s finest purveyors. Do\u00f1a Aurora\u2019s chicken and \u201cmeat\u201d tamal tolimense (from Tolima) is described as great hangover fodder, while warm cheesy pandebono rolls and avena (a chilled oatmeal and vanilla drink) are breakfast staples at Pandebonitos de la virgen. Paloquemao\u2019s street-food queen, however, is Do\u00f1a Rosalba; on Sundays, she sells 2,000 portions of lechona, slow-cooked pork with dried peas and rice that are mixed back into the hog and served with crackling and a white corn arepa. Leave room to sample one last dish \u2013 traditional chicken and three-potato Colombian soup ajiaco \u2013 finishing the four-hour eating tour totally sated. \u2022 From \u00a347pp, private groups from two to 16 people, foodies.com.co Sorrel Moseley-Williams Buenos Aires \u201cAsado means uniting: I\u2019d never eat barbecue on my own because it celebrates family and friends,\u201d says Parrilla Tour guide Antonella Sarag\u00f3 at the first of four restaurant stops. Besides pushing waistline boundaries with abundant servings of meat, this three-hour walking tour also opens the doors to unexpected Buenos Aires corners, revealing low-profile but authentic bodegones (taverns) and steakhouses in Palermo and San Telmo. The first mouthful is legendary Argentine hot sausage sandwich chorip\u00e1n, taken at 120-year-old La Ca\u00f1ita, a former store dating back to when sugar cane grew in this neighbourhood. Unusually, La Ca\u00f1ita\u2019s chori is made from beef rather than pork and homemade chimichurri sauce is the standard topping. Next is pizzeria La Guitarrita (though it also serves empanadas). Here, hand-cut whole-knuckle beef pasties win out over pies, paired with fragrant Torront\u00e9s white wine. The real parrilla deal is revealed at stop three. The sign on this secret spot\u2019s door says \u201ccerrado\u201d (closed) but Antonella knows better. Here, asador Albertito Odetti tends to slabs of Argentina\u2019s prized beef, grill hood decorated with swirly fileteado letters. It\u2019s a legit hole in the wall, with star dishes scrawled on A4 and stuck to windows; there\u2019s puffy provoleta (cheese), hand-cut chips, malbec and a token salad, which are worthy companions to 800g of medium-rare bife de chorizo and entra\u00f1a (to share). It all concludes with dulce de leche ice-cream at Persicco. \u2022 From \u00a366, 3-hour tour, parrillatour.com SMW Looking for a holiday with a difference?

A standardisation programme at the beginning of the 20th century saw 90% of the 550 characters used in kana die out. But these forgotten characters are now being kept alive by the artist and master of Japanese calligraphy <a href=\"http://www.meisterin-akagawa.jp/\">Kaoru Akagawa</a>, who became fascinated with them after deciphering letters from her grandmother.</p> <p>\u201cReading my grandmother\u2019s letters was always difficult for me as a teenage girl,\u201d recalls Akagawa. \u201cHer handwriting looked like scribbling, and I used to ask her to write properly.\u201d But years later, during Akagawa\u2019s calligraphy training, she had a revelation while taking a journey along Himekaido, a historic trading route favoured by women travellers.

      "bodyText": "Anyone who has ever fired off a text in haste will sympathise with the first point on 11th-century Japanese writer Sei Sh\u014dnagon\u2019s list of \u201cinfuriating things\u201d: \u201cThinking of one or two changes in the wording after you\u2019ve sent off a reply to someone\u2019s message.\u201d This list, her messages, and her Pillow Book in which they\u2019re recorded \u2013 a sparklingly acerbic, blog-style frolic through the lives of Heian-era aristocrats \u2013 were written using kana, a Japanese script mainly used by women for nearly a millennium to write literature, arrange secret assignations and express themselves freely within the confines of court life. Women in medieval Japan were discouraged from studying kanji \u2013 characters modelled on written Chinese which represent individual words \u2013 and began using kana, which transcribe words phonetically. A standardisation programme at the beginning of the 20th century saw 90% of the 550 characters used in kana die out. But these forgotten characters are now being kept alive by the artist and master of Japanese calligraphy Kaoru Akagawa, who became fascinated with them after deciphering letters from her grandmother. \u201cReading my grandmother\u2019s letters was always difficult for me as a teenage girl,\u201d recalls Akagawa. \u201cHer handwriting looked like scribbling, and I used to ask her to write properly.\u201d But years later, during Akagawa\u2019s calligraphy training, she had a revelation while taking a journey along Himekaido, a historic trading route favoured by women travellers. Reading documents written in kana housed in castles and temples, Akagawa says: \u201cI felt as if I were reading a history of my DNA.\u201d Far from being scribbles, she realised, her grandmother had been writing to her using the same script. Akagawa uses the forgotten kana in a style of calligraphy called kana shodo, and also fuses traditional calligraphy with new techniques in a style she\u2019s named kana art, where thousands of minutely painted kana form larger images and paper sculptures. \u201cWhen people talk about Japanese calligraphy, they normally mean kanji shodo,\u201d Akagawa explains, \u201ca style imported from China, practiced by samurais and monks.\u201d Kana shodo uses a script which was known by the 10th century as onnade, or \u201cwoman hand\u201d, she continues, which became \u201cthe backbone of a female-dominated literary culture\u201d. Sei Sh\u014dnagon\u2019s contemporary Murasaki Shikibu wrote her masterpiece The Tale of Genji \u2013 often called the world\u2019s first novel \u2013 using kana, which were often associated with private and emotional life. Men who wanted to reply to love letters sent by noblewomen used kana themselves to reply. And the tradition lasted for hundreds of years; the 19th-century novelist Ichiy\u014d Higuchi used kana script for her sympathetic portrait of the life of a geisha, Nigorie (Troubled Waters). Japan\u2019s government standardised writing in 1900, establishing the system of kanji, hiragana and katakana characters used side-by-side in modern written Japanese.

      "body": "<p>In the parallel universe of where Manchester United imagined they would be six years ago David Moyes is planning a little party this weekend, inviting a few close friends around to mark the successful completion of his first Old Trafford contract. The manager has long known he would be staying at United for many years more than that \u2013 he basically gave himself the right to draw up his own terms in his annus mirabilis season of 2015-16, when he signed Jamie Vardy, won the league and the FA Cup and succeeded in persuading David Gill to return in place of floundering chief executive Ed Woodward. But with last season\u2019s European success against Manchester City still fresh in the memory he thinks it would be appropriate to remind everyone that he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/09/david-moyes-manchester-united-six-years\" title=\"\">initially offered only a six-year deal</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/26/manchester-united-sign-aaron-wan-bissaka-crystal-palace-transfer-window-footballl\">Manchester United agree deal to sign Wan-Bissaka for initial \u00a345m fee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nothing in football, or any other sphere of human activity for that matter, is as difficult as trying to foresee the future. Sir Alex Ferguson and Manchester United acted from the best of intentions back in 2013, and you could not have told either party at the time that Moyes\u2019s hitherto impressive managerial career would hit the buffers so quickly, taking in relegation at Sunderland and that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/apr/03/sunderland-david-moyes-tells-reporter-get-slap-bbc-vicki-sparks\" title=\"\">unfortunate remark to the BBC\u2019s Vicki Sparks</a>, or that four managers later the club would be a bigger joke than it ever was in the decade or so before Ferguson arrived from Scotland.</p> <p>That may seem an unnecessarily cruel conclusion, though one only has to stand outside the present Old Trafford to understand that the club is massively bigger than it was 30 years ago, easily dwarfing anything else in English football. The hapless Woodward takes a lot of flak for sweating United\u2019s various noodle and mattress partners, yet this ignominious but necessary stream of income is precisely what enables the club to put a brave face on financial absurdities such as Alexis S\u00e1nchez\u2019s wages or Paul Pogba\u2019s loyalty bonus.</p> <p>When people say \u201cOle\u2019s at the wheel\u201d in the sniggering way they currently do, the joke is partly based on recognition of the fact that the vehicle the boyish novice is driving is actually a juggernaut theoretically capable of flattening anything in its path. No one wishes Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r any harm \u2013 he is a likable character who initially at least worked like a charm in a tricky situation \u2013 though no one expects United to be bothering the top four next season either.</p> <p>Even Woodward must have noticed that Liverpool and City have profited through importing title-winning managers from Germany and Spain, and perhaps more importantly putting recruitment structures in place to facilitate the swift signing of transfer targets. Tottenham have the highly regarded Mauricio Pochettino (highly regarded at Old Trafford as recently as six months ago) and the formidable Daniel Levy. United have the former manager of Molde of the Eliteserien and an alleged vacancy for a director of football, that alleged vacancy for a director of football that the club does not appear to be in any hurry to fill.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"951f9a816b94b60b1aec66617cf1ffe569a557d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/951f9a816b94b60b1aec66617cf1ffe569a557d5/0_216_2267_1360/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Can Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r buck the trend of Manchester United managerial appointments since Sir Alex Ferguson left?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Can Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r buck the trend of Manchester United managerial appointments since Sir Alex Ferguson left?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images via Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ferguson is thought to favour Steve Walsh for the job, despite the soaking the former Leicester scout took in his short stay at Everton, but it remains unclear whether the United hierarchy want anyone else spending their money. Mention of Leicester at least recalls <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/02/leicester-city-win-the-premier-league-title-after-fairytale-season\" title=\"\">the memory of 2016</a> and the notion that just about anyone can spring from the most unpromising circumstances, though while the Foxes\u2019 achievement will never be anything less than sensational it was accomplished at a time when the usual top six contenders were in transition or asleep on the job.

      "bodyText": "In the parallel universe of where Manchester United imagined they would be six years ago David Moyes is planning a little party this weekend, inviting a few close friends around to mark the successful completion of his first Old Trafford contract. The manager has long known he would be staying at United for many years more than that \u2013 he basically gave himself the right to draw up his own terms in his annus mirabilis season of 2015-16, when he signed Jamie Vardy, won the league and the FA Cup and succeeded in persuading David Gill to return in place of floundering chief executive Ed Woodward. But with last season\u2019s European success against Manchester City still fresh in the memory he thinks it would be appropriate to remind everyone that he was initially offered only a six-year deal. Nothing in football, or any other sphere of human activity for that matter, is as difficult as trying to foresee the future. Sir Alex Ferguson and Manchester United acted from the best of intentions back in 2013, and you could not have told either party at the time that Moyes\u2019s hitherto impressive managerial career would hit the buffers so quickly, taking in relegation at Sunderland and that unfortunate remark to the BBC\u2019s Vicki Sparks, or that four managers later the club would be a bigger joke than it ever was in the decade or so before Ferguson arrived from Scotland. That may seem an unnecessarily cruel conclusion, though one only has to stand outside the present Old Trafford to understand that the club is massively bigger than it was 30 years ago, easily dwarfing anything else in English football. The hapless Woodward takes a lot of flak for sweating United\u2019s various noodle and mattress partners, yet this ignominious but necessary stream of income is precisely what enables the club to put a brave face on financial absurdities such as Alexis S\u00e1nchez\u2019s wages or Paul Pogba\u2019s loyalty bonus. When people say \u201cOle\u2019s at the wheel\u201d in the sniggering way they currently do, the joke is partly based on recognition of the fact that the vehicle the boyish novice is driving is actually a juggernaut theoretically capable of flattening anything in its path. No one wishes Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r any harm \u2013 he is a likable character who initially at least worked like a charm in a tricky situation \u2013 though no one expects United to be bothering the top four next season either. Even Woodward must have noticed that Liverpool and City have profited through importing title-winning managers from Germany and Spain, and perhaps more importantly putting recruitment structures in place to facilitate the swift signing of transfer targets. Tottenham have the highly regarded Mauricio Pochettino (highly regarded at Old Trafford as recently as six months ago) and the formidable Daniel Levy. United have the former manager of Molde of the Eliteserien and an alleged vacancy for a director of football, that alleged vacancy for a director of football that the club does not appear to be in any hurry to fill. Ferguson is thought to favour Steve Walsh for the job, despite the soaking the former Leicester scout took in his short stay at Everton, but it remains unclear whether the United hierarchy want anyone else spending their money. Mention of Leicester at least recalls the memory of 2016 and the notion that just about anyone can spring from the most unpromising circumstances, though while the Foxes\u2019 achievement will never be anything less than sensational it was accomplished at a time when the usual top six contenders were in transition or asleep on the job. That will not be happening this season \u2013 City, Liverpool and Spurs have arguably never been more alert \u2013 and with some key playing departures still possible this summer one imagines Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s first full season as United manager might be quite painful. Probably not as painful as Moyes\u2019s first full season as United manager though. The former Everton manager never fully won over the players and did not have a hope of commanding the sort of instant respect Ferguson had come to enjoy. Perhaps the biggest mistake United made was simply not realising how much the club had grown in stature in the 27 years of Ferguson\u2019s tenure, and that seeking a 1986 solution to a 2013 problem was always going to be risky, though in fairness none of the more obvious appointments of the past five years have worked out either, with Solskj\u00e6r unlikely to buck the trend. One hopes Moyes enjoys a drink or two this weekend anyway, perhaps with a wry smile at the way things turned out in a manner that was beyond his control. He could even invite Rafa Ben\u00edtez to join him, for the two former rivals on Merseyside still have plenty in common despite some stark differences in recent experience. Ben\u00edtez is reaching the end of his three-year contract at Newcastle and is leaving the club, presumably fed up of not seeing eye to eye with Mike Ashley, if such an expression is appropriate for two people who hardly ever met. Newcastle were in a mess when Ben\u00edtez took over, and though the club\u2019s future is probably always going to be uncertain under present ownership, the former Liverpool and Real Madrid manager did an admirable job of restoring viability with limited resources. To a man the players appreciated his input, crowds of 52,000 sang his name and all the love that eluded Moyes in Manchester was present on Tyneside for Ben\u00edtez, yet Newcastle have still contrived to lose their most popular and effective manager since Sir Bobby Robson.

      "bodyText": "Bathstore, the UK\u2019s biggest bathroom specialist, has collapsed into administration after failing to find a buyer, putting more than 500 jobs at risk. The loss-making company has appointed administrators at the business services firm BDO, which said the retailer would continue to trade for now in the hope it could be sold as a going concern. So far, administrators have not received any offers. Bathstore has 132 stores and 529 staff. Most employees \u2013 405 people \u2013 are shop workers, while 124 are in the head office in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire. Ryan Grant, the joint administrator, said: \u201cDespite significant investment into the business over the past five years, Bathstore has struggled to overcome the well-documented challenges facing the UK retail sector. \u201cThe appointment was made after several months of difficult trading and the failure of ongoing talks to find a buyer for the business. Bathstore is continuing to trade in administration while the administrators seek a buyer.\u201d He said Bathstore should be able to fulfil the majority of outstanding customer orders, although all installation services have ceased. Customers will be contacted directly but can also find information on the company\u2019s website. It is the latest retailer facing a financial crunch, with many others going out of business or closing stores. The British Retail Consortium says retail conditions are the toughest in a decade. It is understood that Bathstore\u2019s owner, the American billionaire Warren Stephens, who backed a management buyout in 2014, was unwilling to put in more cash to save the business before this month\u2019s rent day. The company was founded in 1990 by Patrick Riley and Nico de Beer, who opened the first shop in Croydon. Bathstore made a pre-tax loss of \u00a322m in the year to 31 July 2017 with sales of \u00a3141m, according to the last set of results filed with Companies House. The loss reflected exceptional costs of \u00a311m, including a \u00a35.4m writedown on the value of its stores and leases. Last year, the company embarked on a turnaround plan. Stephens provided a \u00a315m loan and extended the maturity of previous loans to the end of next month. It also appointed a new chief executive, Ian Herrett, who joined in May 2018 from the builders\u2019 merchants Wolseley UK. Its rival Better Bathrooms slumped into administration in March with the loss of 325 jobs. The \u00a31bn-a-year bathroom retail sector has been hit by the slowdown in the housing market and weak consumer confidence, with sales of big-ticket items particularly hard hit.",

      "bodyText": "Tributes have been paid to Ivan Cooper, a founder of Northern Ireland\u2019s civil rights movement, who has died aged 75. The former politician, one of the few Protestant leaders who marched with Catholics on Bloody Sunday, died in hospital on Wednesday. Born into a working-class family in Killaloo, near Derry, he was a founding member of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party in 1970 and served as an MP at Westminster and as a community relations minister during the Sunningdale administration in 1974. Colum Eastwood, the SDLP leader, said Cooper embodied Ireland\u2019s contrasting traditions and campaigned for fairness for people regardless of their background. \u201cIvan Cooper was born to break the mould. A working-class Protestant man who saw a common injustice and inequality that had taken root in Protestant and Catholic communities, he dedicated his life to fighting it,\u201d he said. \u201cOrganising marches in Derry for the right to a home, the right to a job and the right to a vote, Ivan often put himself in the path of danger to secure justice for people in every community. And on many occasions that meant that he suffered vilification and violence for his convictions. It never stopped him.\u201d Eastwood said that along with John Hume, a former SDLP leader, Cooper helped \u201cblaze the trail\u201d that led to the 1998 Good Friday agreement. Cooper wanted Catholics and Protestants to form a united front against injustice, but the violence and polarisation of the Troubles swept aside that vision. Many Protestants considered him a traitor. He was with civil rights marchers on 30 January 1972 when British soldiers opened fire, killing 14 people. He once told the BBC he \u201calways regretted\u201d organising the march because no political cause was worth a life. The actor James Nesbitt, who played Cooper in the film Bloody Sunday, said he was brave, brilliant and humane. \u201cHe was a sparkly man, a teller of tall stories, remarkably funny and extremely charming - but his impact on the peace process should never be underestimated.\u201d Cooper quit politics in the 1980s. The Irish president, Michael D Higgins, gave him a civil rights award last year. Robin Swann, the leader of the Ulster Unionist party, said Cooper\u2019s commitment to non-violent, peaceful and democratic methods was an example for Northern Ireland. \u201cHad voices like his prevailed, we could perhaps have been spared the disaster and misery that was the Troubles,\u201d he said. Pat Hume said Cooper walked hand-in-hand with her husband, John, in seeking a non-violent, non-sectarian Northern Ireland. \u201cHis commitment and courage and his desire and determination to tackle these issues never waned \u2026 Ivan Cooper will for ever hold a special place, not only in our hearts, but in the history of this island and in the continuing of the fight for civil rights and social justice.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The Thames is 215 miles from source to sea, and for centuries writers of all kinds have been inspired by it, returning to its banks again and again to explore what it can tell us about memory, history and landscape. It\u2019s one of the most written-about parts of Britain \u2013 there\u2019s something irresistible about the river that makes it a perfect background to all kinds of storytelling.</p> <p>My introduction to this wealth of river writing began at the end: I grew up sailing on the Thames estuary \u2013 the muddy, sometimes smelly, coastal area downstream from London where the famous river finally joins the North Sea. My parents arrived here after sailing thousands of miles from South Africa in a boat they had built themselves. By the time I was born a few years later, the estuary had ceased to be just a point of entry for them. It was home.</p> <p>When I began work on my book about this area, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/way-to-the-sea-9781783784134.html\">The Way to the Sea</a>, I discovered the estuary hasn\u2019t always been a popular subject for those writing about the river \u2013 it inspired only a fraction of the thousands of titles about the Thames with something to say about the places I know. In my own writing, I\u2019ve always tried to think about the Thames as one long, living piece of landscape, with no one part missed out, and for that reason I gravitate towards books that do the same. Here are 10 of the best:</p> <p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/sep/16/historybooks.features1\">Thames: Sacred River by Peter Ackroyd</a><br></strong>The nearest thing there is to a comprehensive modern biography of the river, packed with fascinating titbits about its literary, artistic and religious connections down the ages. It\u2019s particularly good on the upper reaches of the Thames before it gets to London, where medieval monasteries used to stand at every bend and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/04/chaucer-canterbury-tales-2012-multimedia\">pilgrims would pass by on their way to the great shrine at Canterbury</a>.</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/02/jerome-k-jerome-three-men-in-a-boat-centenary-1959\">Three Men in a Boat by Jerome K Jerome</a><br></strong>This comic novel from 1889 is a classic for a reason. It captured the moment when commercial shipping traffic vanished on the upper Thames and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/aug/13/historybooks.features\">it became a place for leisure</a>, where Jerome, his two friends and their dog Montmorency could splash about and submerge the stresses of London life in the glories of the river. Such was this book\u2019s runaway popularity that Jerome\u2019s publisher once commented: \u201cI cannot imagine what becomes of all the copies of that book I issue. I often think the public must eat them.\u201d</p> <p><strong>3. The True Heart by Sylvia Townsend Warner<br></strong>A deceptively simple love story I could reread endlessly. It was first published in 1929, but is set in 1873 out on the Essex marshes, where the Thames merges with the sea. Sukey Bond is a lowly orphan, in service on a remote farm where she meets and falls in love with Eric Seaborn, a simple lad known as a \u201choly fool\u201d. When they are forcibly parted, Sukey heads upriver to seek out Queen Victoria, who she feels is the one person who will understand their plight.</p> <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/09/100-best-novels-the-wind-in-the-willows-kenneth-grahame\">The Wind in the Willows</a></strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/09/100-best-novels-the-wind-in-the-willows-kenneth-grahame\"> </a></strong></em><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/09/100-best-novels-the-wind-in-the-willows-kenneth-grahame\">by Kenneth Grahame</a><br></strong>This one needs no introduction \u2013 the charms of \u201cmessing about in boats\u201d with Ratty and Mole are very well known indeed. But it wasn\u2019t until I started researching my own book that I realised how much it has to say about the river and the 19th-century expansion of London that changed the surrounding countryside forever. I also love Grahame\u2019s image of the Thames as \u201ca babbling procession of the best stories in the world\u201d. That\u2019s how I like to think of it, too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e973072385e60af4c1f66c13925173a91e3727b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e973072385e60af4c1f66c13925173a91e3727b/0_234_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boats in the dawn mist upriver at Abingdon-on-Thames, part of the stretch where Three Men in a Boat is set.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boats in the dawn mist upriver at Abingdon-on-Thames, part of the stretch where Three Men in a Boat is set.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stuart Black/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/apr/29/highereducation.history\">The House by the Thames by Gillian Tindall</a><br></strong>This biography of a single house that sits just by the south side of the Millennium Bridge is fascinating for what it shows about the transition of inner London from dirty and crime-ridden to expensive, glassed-in corporate playground. I particularly like how famous people such as Christopher Wren and Catherine of Aragon are just background characters in this book \u2013 the real star is the house and all that it represents about the river and the city.</p> <p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/sep/21/classics.charlesdickens\">Great Expectations by Charles Dickens</a><br></strong>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/dec/21/walking-north-kent-marshes-hoo-peninsula-charles-dickens\">Hoo peninsula</a>, a spur of land between the Thames and its final tributary the Medway, is not a place that has appeared much in classic fiction. But it\u2019s in a graveyard near the Hoo\u2019s highest point that young Pip meets the convict Magwitch, who has just escaped from a prison hulk and is fleeing his jailers through the Thames marshes. I first read this scene as a teenager and I still find it chilling. Pip is terrified, but little knows that this chance meeting will change the course of his life.</p> <p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/24/downstream-a-history-and-celebration-of-swimming-the-river-thames-caitlin-davies-review\">Downstream: A History and Celebration of Swimming the River Thames by Caitlin Davies</a><br></strong>This book is a delightful compendium of watery facts and documents the changing physical relationship we have with the river. Swimming in the Thames has been a popular pastime for centuries, despite its often murky and polluted waters. Organised races have been going on that long, too \u2013 in 1791 the winner of an eight-guinea wager swim from Westminster Bridge to London Bridge \u201cexpired\u201d after celebrating too hard on the gin, and in 1880 a dog named Now Then beat a man in a 10-mile swim upriver from the Isle of Sheppey.</p> <p><strong>8. The Mirror of the Sea by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/josephconrad\">Joseph Conrad</a><br></strong>Before he was a novelist, Conrad spent nearly<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/dec/01/classics.josephconrad\"> two decades in the merchant navy</a>, and after retiring he published this selection of autobiographical essays about his time on the high seas. I love it for his accounts of sailing in and out of the Thames in the late 19th century, and for his descriptions of riverside life in London, where smaller wharves were still in use alongside the big docks in east London. The ships in the centre of the city looked like \u201ca flock of swans kept in the flooded backyard of grim tenement houses\u201d, he wrote.</p> <p><strong>9. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/may/17/guardian190-william-morris-news-from-nowhere\">News from Nowhere by William Morris</a><br></strong>I\u2019ve read this strange story so many times and I still can\u2019t decide what it is: my best approximation is part science fiction, part utopian treatise, part romance of the river. Its protagonist, William Guest, falls asleep in the late 19th century and wakes in the future. He finds that a revolution has occurred and society has been refashioned along communist lines. He rows up the Thames with a group of comrades to see this new world, a journey that mirrors one the Morris family took between their two Thames-side residences, one in London at Hammersmith and one at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/oct/25/william-morris-country-home-kelmscott-manor-cotswolds-gets-43m-lottery-grant\">Kelmscott</a> in Gloucestershire.</p> <p><strong>10. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jun/10/fiction.johncunningham\">Wide Open by Nicola Barker</a><br></strong>This novel from 1998 is precious to me because it\u2019s set on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/may/10/lets-move-to-isle-of-sheppey-kent\">Isle of Sheppey</a> in the Thames estuary, and accurately represents it as the very peculiar place I knew as a child. Barker fills this marshy island with drifters and eccentrics, characters who find themselves out of place and dislocated from the \u201creal life\u201d upriver. Her writing is full of surprises, from nudists to wild boars to unexploded bombs, but the landscape of the river\u2019s edge is a constant presence.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Way to the Sea: The Forgotten Histories of the Thames Estuary by Caroline Crampton is published by Granta Books.

A documentary series, Emily Atack: Adulting, starts this week on W.</p> <p>One scene from Adulting features Atack having a fertility test, on screen. Like Atack, her ovaries are over-achievers. \u201cSixteen follicles!\u201d quips the doctor examining her. \u201cWell done you!\u201d (A follicle count of around 10 would be average.) Having a fertility test felt both reassuring, and also nerve-wracking, she says: \u201cWhen you look at your body like that on a screen, and you know the science of it all, you go: \u2018Right, OK, so in two years\u2019 time that will diminish.\u2019 You do need to think about it. The doctor even said to me: \u2018Well done for getting this checked out.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Although viewers might struggle to understand Atack\u2019s concerns about her fertility at her age, she worries about it because most of her friends have already started having kids. \u201cIt\u2019s normal to be in the industry and not have kids right now, because everyone\u2019s very career-savvy. But because I don\u2019t surround myself with that, but with my mates I\u2019ve been hanging around with since I was 12, they\u2019re all doing the Bedfordshire baby thing. I think, should I be doing that?\u201d</p> <p> Atack comes from a show-business dynasty. Her mother, Kate Robbins, is a comedian best known for her work on the satirical show Spitting Image. Her father, Keith Atack, is a musician, and Paul McCartney is a relative. Growing up, famous friends of her parents were constantly around. She reminisces about popping over to Victoria Wood\u2019s house, and going to a Steps gig with Julie Walters and Dawn French. Despite her starry background, Atack is curiously classless in real life \u2013 you would never associate her with the other privileged scions of celebrity families. She attributes this to her parents\u2019 decision to send her to a state school. \u201cWe grew up very normal kids \u2013 I hate the word normal, because it makes it sound boring. I don\u2019t mean that. It was just a very suburban, ordinary school. I love my parents for not sending us to private school. I\u2019m still friends with all the people I went to school with now.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed2f92fba5bb51e19ecee18febb188683e85fb7b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed2f92fba5bb51e19ecee18febb188683e85fb7b/0_22_5024_6279/800.jpg\" alt=\"Winning a new fanbase \u2026 Atack on I\u2019m A Celebrity.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Winning a new fanbase \u2026 Atack on I\u2019m A Celebrity.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Gourley/ITV/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Atack has very much branded herself as an ordinary woman, trying to make sense of a quarter-life crisis.It is a savvy move \u2013 who doesn\u2019t, approaching 30, sometimes feel lost? But I\u2019m not buying it. She doesn\u2019t look as if her life is a shambles. If anything, things are going superbly for the 29-year-old: her career is flying, and she is in a relationship with the film producer Rob Jowers. It is a remarkable turnaround, given where things were a year ago. Is she really as shambolic as she would have us believe? \u201cTo be honest, if I look at my life as a whole, it\u2019s in a million times better place than it was,\u201d she admits. \u201cSo in that sense, absolutely, I\u2019m getting it all together.\u201d</p> <p>It is easy to forget how long Atack has been in the business \u2013 she was 17 when she was cast in The Inbetweeners. She then became a regular fixture in lads\u2019 magazines \u2013 the covers are still hanging on her living room walls. \u201cI was getting all of these glamorous, sexy, girl-next-door-type roles, and that\u2019s great. I was all: \u2018Hey, I\u2019m sexy!\u2019 Posing in my pants. But you can\u2019t do that for ever. You especially can\u2019t do that, if \u2013 like me \u2013 you love going to the pub and you love Christmas Day dinners every weekend. The point is, my body was becoming way more womanly, and I wasn\u2019t looking like the girl next door any more.\u201d</p> <p>When the sexy ingenue roles started to dry up, Atack changed direction. \u201cI did this whole thing of going: \u2018I want to be taken seriously as an actor, I don\u2019t want to be this pin-uppy type any more, I\u2019m going to dye my hair brown and try and do that. I\u2019m an actor now. I\u2019m going to play police officers.\u2019\u201d It didn\u2019t work. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve cemented a vision in people\u2019s minds of what you are in the industry, that\u2019s the only way people see you.\u201d Meanwhile, light entertainment kept calling.</p> <p>\u201cI was knocking on all these doors, trying to get into a party I just wasn\u2019t invited to,\u201d she laughs. \u201cAnd then I had the party of light entertainment, going: \u2018You\u2019re invited! Come here!\u2019 And I\u2019d been saying: \u2018No, no no\u2019 for ages. And then I thought: You know what? This is the party I\u2019m going to go to, where I\u2019m invited, and where I can be the best version of myself that I can be.\u201d But persuading her agency that she was going to pause her acting career was a struggle. \u201cI had to be honest with them and just be like: \u2018Guys, I\u2019m not trying to be the next Keira Knightley.

An <a href=\"https://learning.nspcc.org.uk/media/1067/how-safe-are-our-children-2018.pdf\">NSPCC report</a> shows that the number of recorded sexual offences against children has been steadily increasing throughout the UK since 2012.

While players can be armed, attributed in-game to the prevalence of 3D printers, if you don\u2019t take out your guns, the enemy won\u2019t take out theirs. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to give the Metropolitan police guns, and in fact, some of the police characters might be sympathetic to your cause,\u201d says Hocking. \u201cThe motivation of DedSec is to bring people together. \u201cDivision is the root of the problems of the world of Watch Dogs, and they\u2019re trying to get the people of London to put aside their differences and fight the real threats.\u201d Watch Dogs Legion is out on 6 March 2020.",

United have also not agreed to any sell-on clause in the terms of Wan-Bissaka\u2019s transfer.</p> <p>Wan-Bissaka, like James, is fast and has a rawness the manager hopes to mould as he bids to drive United forward next season. The right-back has not yet made 50 Premier League appearances and was in Aidy Boothroyd\u2019s England Under-21 squad that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/25/error-prone-england-boothroyd-european-under-21-championship\" title=\"\">failed to win a game at the European Championship</a> currently underway in Italy.</p> <p>Solskj\u00e6r is still thought to be targeting several positions, including a centre-back \u2013 Harry Maguire is in the frame \u2013 a full-back, a midfielder and a striker. Paul Pogba and Romelu Lukaku both wish to depart and it may be that the Norwegian has to generate funds from the sales of the pair \u2013 or others \u2013 before being able to make further, substantial outlays this summer.</p> <p>Lukaku favours a move to Internazionale, with the Italian club hoping to secure a deal for the striker, who wants the move, before United\u2019s pre-season tour of Australia and east Asia. Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s squad is due to fly to Perth on 7 July.</p> <p>Meanwhile, discussions are continuing between the club and David de Gea regarding fresh terms but there is frustration among the hierarchy due to a lack of a breakthrough. The Spaniard\u2019s current deal expires in 12 months after United were forced to trigger the one-year extension clause to prevent him walking away for free this summer.</p> <p>While United are intent on signing De Gea for the long term, they may be forced to sell him before the close of the transfer window on 8 August. If they do not and the 28-year-old does not agree a new contract, the club face the prospect of receiving no fee for a goalkeeper who is rated among the world\u2019s finest and could otherwise command a sum in the region of \u00a375m.</p> <p>Injuries permitting, Solskj\u00e6r will have his entire squad available for the upcoming tour, apart from Alexis S\u00e1nchez who is at the Copa America with Chile.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Manchester United are set to sign Aaron Wan-Bissaka for \u00a345m from Crystal Palace as Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r adds a second player to his squad who fits his desired profile of a youngster with potential. The 21-year-old right-back is expected to join imminently in a deal that with add-ons may push the final price to around \u00a350m. Solskj\u00e6r has already added Daniel James, also 21, to his squad, the winger arriving from Swansea for \u00a315m this month. Palace have not managed to amend or have removed the 20% sell-on clause in the deal that took Wilfried Zaha back to the club from United in the summer of 2015. United have also not agreed to any sell-on clause in the terms of Wan-Bissaka\u2019s transfer. Wan-Bissaka, like James, is fast and has a rawness the manager hopes to mould as he bids to drive United forward next season. The right-back has not yet made 50 Premier League appearances and was in Aidy Boothroyd\u2019s England Under-21 squad that failed to win a game at the European Championship currently underway in Italy. Solskj\u00e6r is still thought to be targeting several positions, including a centre-back \u2013 Harry Maguire is in the frame \u2013 a full-back, a midfielder and a striker. Paul Pogba and Romelu Lukaku both wish to depart and it may be that the Norwegian has to generate funds from the sales of the pair \u2013 or others \u2013 before being able to make further, substantial outlays this summer. Lukaku favours a move to Internazionale, with the Italian club hoping to secure a deal for the striker, who wants the move, before United\u2019s pre-season tour of Australia and east Asia. Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s squad is due to fly to Perth on 7 July. Meanwhile, discussions are continuing between the club and David de Gea regarding fresh terms but there is frustration among the hierarchy due to a lack of a breakthrough. The Spaniard\u2019s current deal expires in 12 months after United were forced to trigger the one-year extension clause to prevent him walking away for free this summer. While United are intent on signing De Gea for the long term, they may be forced to sell him before the close of the transfer window on 8 August. If they do not and the 28-year-old does not agree a new contract, the club face the prospect of receiving no fee for a goalkeeper who is rated among the world\u2019s finest and could otherwise command a sum in the region of \u00a375m. Injuries permitting, Solskj\u00e6r will have his entire squad available for the upcoming tour, apart from Alexis S\u00e1nchez who is at the Copa America with Chile.",

      "body": "<p>Most people know what a nurse or a social worker does and will have some understanding of what is needed to become one of these frontline health or social care professionals. But ask the same group of people whether they know what a registered manager is and how they qualify for the job, and the questioner is likely to be met with blank faces.</p> <p>Registered managers are a largely unknown workforce outside of adult social care, even though they hold one of the most pivotal and influential roles within the sector. \u201cThe buck stops with the registered manager,\u201d explains Georgina Turner, Skills for Care\u2019s interim director of sector development \u2013 engagement. \u201cThe experiences that people have of the sector are influenced by the registered manager as well as the day-to-day culture in the workplace.\u201d</p> <p>There are 23,000 registered managers in England. Every adult care service registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) regulator must have its own registered manager. They have overall statutory responsibility for making sure care standards are met and that there are enough skilled staff recruited and trained to deliver quality care. But the post also comes with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/skills-for-care-partner-zone/2018/nov/01/to-be-good-or-outstanding-you-need-to-be-well-led\">leadership</a> responsibilities.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a role that is easy to categorise and there isn\u2019t something comparable outside the sector,\u201d says Turner. \u201cBut a good indicator of the fact it\u2019s a multifaceted job is that we\u2019re now seeing occasions where the role is split. In some organisations, a registered manager will be looking after care provision, staff development and day-to-day aspects, while in another they might have a more strategic role \u2013 overseeing a number of services for the same organisation and taking on business development. That said, it\u2019s worth remembering that most managers are still responsible for a single service at a single site.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7f22495eac69e7f73910adf6b55769d12b8c01fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f22495eac69e7f73910adf6b55769d12b8c01fd/0_20_1731_1039/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Arab muslim business woman in headscarf hijab working at desk, hardworking confident focused worker\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Recent research shows that 70% of registered managers were recruited in-house.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daxiao Productions/Stocksy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now Skills for Care, the membership organisation for registered managers, wants to raise the professional profile of the role and help providers support deputy managers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/skills-for-care-partner-zone/2018/nov/01/to-be-good-or-outstanding-you-need-to-be-well-led\">team leaders</a>, senior care staff and others to take that next step up the career ladder. It also hopes the move will prompt organisations to take on succession planning, as approximately 10,000 of today\u2019s registered managers could retire in the next 10 years. Also, the <a href=\"https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/NMDS-SC-intelligence/Workforce-intelligence/publications/Topics/Registered-managers.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">vacancy rate for the role is 11.8%</a> \u2013 compared with 8% across the sector. Turner says: \u201cA survey we carried out last year found that 70% of registered managers were offered the role by their existing employer \u2013 many hadn\u2019t planned to become a registered manager. When you put that in the context of staff turnover, the number of SME providers, and consider that it\u2019s a complex job, then the role really shouldn\u2019t be something that you just fall into.\u201d</p> <p>New Skills for Care online resources, designed to help providers develop the role, create definite career paths and support those already doing the job, are due to be launched in June.</p> <p>Providers will be able to find existing material for registered managers in a single place. This includes the Lead to succeed development programme, the 11 professional standards they are expected to meet and details of the Skills for Care national support network for registered managers. Advice for registered managers around how to recruit, retain and develop their staff will also be included. The results of Skills for Care\u2019s two successful development projects \u2013 the Aspiring manager and the New registered manager programmes \u2013 have helped shape the material. And \u00a33m of Department of Health and Social Care workforce <a href=\"https://www.skillsforcare.org.uk/About/News/News-Archive/Workforce-Development-Fund-2019-20-now-open-for-grant-applications.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">funding</a> has also been set aside for providers to spend on developing the registered manager role this year.</p> <p>The Home Group housing association and care provider won national recognition for the support it gives registered managers in the 2018 Skills for Care Accolades awards.</p> <p>So what does Home Group do that sets it apart from others?</p> <p>The organisation has its own national network of registered managers who meet every two months to discuss problems and issues. Registered managers have access to clinical supervision with a mental health nurse or psychologist, if needed, to reflect on practice or deal with stress.

      "bodyText": "Most people know what a nurse or a social worker does and will have some understanding of what is needed to become one of these frontline health or social care professionals. But ask the same group of people whether they know what a registered manager is and how they qualify for the job, and the questioner is likely to be met with blank faces. Registered managers are a largely unknown workforce outside of adult social care, even though they hold one of the most pivotal and influential roles within the sector. \u201cThe buck stops with the registered manager,\u201d explains Georgina Turner, Skills for Care\u2019s interim director of sector development \u2013 engagement. \u201cThe experiences that people have of the sector are influenced by the registered manager as well as the day-to-day culture in the workplace.\u201d There are 23,000 registered managers in England. Every adult care service registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) regulator must have its own registered manager. They have overall statutory responsibility for making sure care standards are met and that there are enough skilled staff recruited and trained to deliver quality care. But the post also comes with leadership responsibilities. \u201cIt\u2019s not a role that is easy to categorise and there isn\u2019t something comparable outside the sector,\u201d says Turner. \u201cBut a good indicator of the fact it\u2019s a multifaceted job is that we\u2019re now seeing occasions where the role is split. In some organisations, a registered manager will be looking after care provision, staff development and day-to-day aspects, while in another they might have a more strategic role \u2013 overseeing a number of services for the same organisation and taking on business development. That said, it\u2019s worth remembering that most managers are still responsible for a single service at a single site.\u201d Now Skills for Care, the membership organisation for registered managers, wants to raise the professional profile of the role and help providers support deputy managers, team leaders, senior care staff and others to take that next step up the career ladder. It also hopes the move will prompt organisations to take on succession planning, as approximately 10,000 of today\u2019s registered managers could retire in the next 10 years. Also, the vacancy rate for the role is 11.8% \u2013 compared with 8% across the sector. Turner says: \u201cA survey we carried out last year found that 70% of registered managers were offered the role by their existing employer \u2013 many hadn\u2019t planned to become a registered manager. When you put that in the context of staff turnover, the number of SME providers, and consider that it\u2019s a complex job, then the role really shouldn\u2019t be something that you just fall into.\u201d New Skills for Care online resources, designed to help providers develop the role, create definite career paths and support those already doing the job, are due to be launched in June. Providers will be able to find existing material for registered managers in a single place. This includes the Lead to succeed development programme, the 11 professional standards they are expected to meet and details of the Skills for Care national support network for registered managers. Advice for registered managers around how to recruit, retain and develop their staff will also be included. The results of Skills for Care\u2019s two successful development projects \u2013 the Aspiring manager and the New registered manager programmes \u2013 have helped shape the material. And \u00a33m of Department of Health and Social Care workforce funding has also been set aside for providers to spend on developing the registered manager role this year. The Home Group housing association and care provider won national recognition for the support it gives registered managers in the 2018 Skills for Care Accolades awards. So what does Home Group do that sets it apart from others? The organisation has its own national network of registered managers who meet every two months to discuss problems and issues. Registered managers have access to clinical supervision with a mental health nurse or psychologist, if needed, to reflect on practice or deal with stress. There are regular registered manager group meetings where CQC expectations are discussed alongside what they do well or need to improve on. Home Group\u2019s HR team develop registered managers\u2019 recruitment skills, professional performance and give them the tools they need to have \u201cchallenging conversations\u201d with staff who are failing to come up to scratch and identify where they need help. Home Group registered manager Deb Duggan says the support has been invaluable: \u201cBeing a registered manager is a huge responsibility. CQC makes it very clear that I am the responsible person and if something goes wrong it has the power to send me to prison. But here I feel valued, supported and listened to. If there is a gap in staff knowledge or I need extra support, it\u2019s recognised.\u201d Rachael Byrne, Home Group\u2019s executive director of new models of care, predicts that boosting the profile of registered managers could be good news for the sector as a whole: \u201cI think if people see the complexity and depth of the role, it may improve their view of care and assure families and friends that quality and safety are paramount.\u201d To find out more, click here",

      "body": "<p>When Peter Wright plays darts, he is escorted to and from the stage by security. The image of a snake, to match his Snakebite Wright nickname, or similar patterns are painted on the side of his head by his wife, who also dyes his hair bright colors for each competition. The crowd cheers, and if the competition happens to be the Professional Darts Corporation World Championships, the 49-year-old Scot could be playing live in front of nearly 70,000 fans in the span of a fortnight. He\u2019s been recognized in such far-reaching places as Japan.</p> \n<p>Such over-the-top showmanship is common in the UK and Europe, where unique personalities have boosted what was once an accessory to a few pints into a spectacle that today nets seven-figure viewerships for World Championship Finals broadcasts and elicits comparisons to professional wrestling.</p> \n<p>Yet on the other side of the Atlantic, darts remains a pub sport. Despite an estimated 17m players in the United States according to the National Sporting Goods Association, there are no Americans currently among the top 183 players in PDC\u2019s World Rankings.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9c7b055f-61b3-4d64-8609-1c82622f846b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uZ_5LxEC70U?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Personalities like Wright\u2019s do exist in the world of US darts. American Darters Association president Karl Remick cites players in his organization who he thinks, if given the chance, would have breakout careers on a major stage. Darts leagues are growing year over year throughout the country, and Remick sees untapped opportunity on the horizon.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are more chances or choices or options out there as a whole,\u201d Remick says. \u201cWe have tons of characters or people you\u2019d want to follow or see what kind of shenanigans they can get into.\u201d</p> \n<p>Remick\u2019s ADA is one of three major darts organizations currently operating in the US, along with the ADO (American Darts Organization) and the NDA (National Dart Association). The ADA, founded in 1990, operates in 30 states and is the only one of the trio that encompasses both the traditional steel tip and electronic soft tip styles of the game.</p> \n<p>The ADO is the largest steel tip organization, while the NDA represents the less popular section of soft tip darts, primarily consisting of manufacturers aiming to increase participation by placing soft-tip machines in leagues. Tom Sawyer, current ADO president, describes a friendly relationship between the bodies, even as they\u2019re defined by differences over rules and formats.</p> \n<p>Remick believes the only ways darts can flourish in the US is if all parties put their resources to a distinct strategic plan. \u201cThey always think it\u2019s a good idea, [but] they never do it in the long run,\u201d he says. \u201cWithout one common goal we can\u2019t go anywhere. We can\u2019t get on the same page for some strange reason.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Without a unified goal, darts in the US doesn\u2019t stand a chance of rising above the current level of hobbyists</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Sawyer agrees, but admits his priority is turning around the ADO before he can focus on any larger strategic picture. When he was elected president the ADO was \u201ca financial disaster\u201d near \u201crock bottom\u201d and in need of a guiding hand to increase participation again, which has precluded him from any sort of partnership talks for the time being, though he is not opposed.</p> \n<p>Yet without a unified goal, darts in the US doesn\u2019t stand a chance of rising above the current level of hobbyists.</p> \n<p>Although the ADA counts thousands of casual players as members, Remick only cites 117 professionals as being part of that group in 2019. The ADO counts around 700 dedicated players out of 100,000 total active, with as many as 2,500 getting national rankings points at some point in the year across both genders \u2013 that number fluctuating as some players don\u2019t compete in national events until later in the calendar year.</p> \n<p>The limited numbers of top competitors relative to the massive overall pool is due in no small part to the lack of ability to make a living off the sport for US players. According to Sawyer, many of the best players are sponsored by local breweries, regional companies or in some cases the darts companies themselves. Those deals are usually only enough to net players $350 to $400 a month, far from enough to make a living and dedicate an unfettered amount of time to darts, especially when compared to the tens of thousands of dollars players in Europe are able to net from their sponsorships.</p> \n<p>Without an overarching plan to grow the sport further, or the ability for players to dedicate themselves fully to their careers, there can be no true consistency to what is, right now, a fragmented system of evangelizing the sport and providing a monetary reward for playing it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"58a8c8995f88cf9461430152053831bf2bfe9e73\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58a8c8995f88cf9461430152053831bf2bfe9e73/0_102_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Wright\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unique personalities, such as Scotland\u2019s Peter Wright, have boosted a game that was once an accessory to a few pints, into a spectacle that today nets seven-figure viewerships in Europe.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlie Crowhurst/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>One of the most difficult obstacles to overcome for American darts leagues as they battle for relevancy is that there are already so many other entertainment options sucking up real estate on television or other traditional platforms. Not the least of which is the PDC itself, which is featured on ESPN and has a preexisting fandom in the US. If someone who loves darts already has an attachment to the established world of the PDC, it\u2019s much harder to convince them to tune in for a lesser known league with unknown competitors.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/dec/28/darts-pdc-world-championship-dimitri-van-den-bergh-devon-petersen\">Darts keeps dreaming big but its spirit remains rooted at Alexandra Palace</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>US leagues also generally play cricket \u2013 a game that rarely requires a set amount of time \u2013 while the PDO is structured around the more straightforward, and thus more easily televisable, game of 501. One or two games of cricket could take as long as a best-of-11-games set of 501 matches, says Sawyer, making it \u201calmost impossible to stream\u201d. If deciding between a known ratings success that can fit in a set time slot for off-peak programming and an unknown entity that can take hours upon hours to finish, the choice is a simple one.</p> \n<p>Many US organizations do stream their tournaments, mostly through a partnered streaming platform or via DartConnect scoring, an electronic platform that allows fans to track their favorite players\u2019 matches which alerts fans when they\u2019re up during a tournament.

      "bodyText": "When Peter Wright plays darts, he is escorted to and from the stage by security. The image of a snake, to match his Snakebite Wright nickname, or similar patterns are painted on the side of his head by his wife, who also dyes his hair bright colors for each competition. The crowd cheers, and if the competition happens to be the Professional Darts Corporation World Championships, the 49-year-old Scot could be playing live in front of nearly 70,000 fans in the span of a fortnight. He\u2019s been recognized in such far-reaching places as Japan. Such over-the-top showmanship is common in the UK and Europe, where unique personalities have boosted what was once an accessory to a few pints into a spectacle that today nets seven-figure viewerships for World Championship Finals broadcasts and elicits comparisons to professional wrestling. Yet on the other side of the Atlantic, darts remains a pub sport. Despite an estimated 17m players in the United States according to the National Sporting Goods Association, there are no Americans currently among the top 183 players in PDC\u2019s World Rankings. Personalities like Wright\u2019s do exist in the world of US darts. American Darters Association president Karl Remick cites players in his organization who he thinks, if given the chance, would have breakout careers on a major stage. Darts leagues are growing year over year throughout the country, and Remick sees untapped opportunity on the horizon. \u201cThere are more chances or choices or options out there as a whole,\u201d Remick says. \u201cWe have tons of characters or people you\u2019d want to follow or see what kind of shenanigans they can get into.\u201d Remick\u2019s ADA is one of three major darts organizations currently operating in the US, along with the ADO (American Darts Organization) and the NDA (National Dart Association). The ADA, founded in 1990, operates in 30 states and is the only one of the trio that encompasses both the traditional steel tip and electronic soft tip styles of the game. The ADO is the largest steel tip organization, while the NDA represents the less popular section of soft tip darts, primarily consisting of manufacturers aiming to increase participation by placing soft-tip machines in leagues. Tom Sawyer, current ADO president, describes a friendly relationship between the bodies, even as they\u2019re defined by differences over rules and formats. Remick believes the only ways darts can flourish in the US is if all parties put their resources to a distinct strategic plan. \u201cThey always think it\u2019s a good idea, [but] they never do it in the long run,\u201d he says. \u201cWithout one common goal we can\u2019t go anywhere. We can\u2019t get on the same page for some strange reason.\u201d Sawyer agrees, but admits his priority is turning around the ADO before he can focus on any larger strategic picture. When he was elected president the ADO was \u201ca financial disaster\u201d near \u201crock bottom\u201d and in need of a guiding hand to increase participation again, which has precluded him from any sort of partnership talks for the time being, though he is not opposed. Yet without a unified goal, darts in the US doesn\u2019t stand a chance of rising above the current level of hobbyists. Although the ADA counts thousands of casual players as members, Remick only cites 117 professionals as being part of that group in 2019. The ADO counts around 700 dedicated players out of 100,000 total active, with as many as 2,500 getting national rankings points at some point in the year across both genders \u2013 that number fluctuating as some players don\u2019t compete in national events until later in the calendar year. The limited numbers of top competitors relative to the massive overall pool is due in no small part to the lack of ability to make a living off the sport for US players. According to Sawyer, many of the best players are sponsored by local breweries, regional companies or in some cases the darts companies themselves. Those deals are usually only enough to net players $350 to $400 a month, far from enough to make a living and dedicate an unfettered amount of time to darts, especially when compared to the tens of thousands of dollars players in Europe are able to net from their sponsorships. Without an overarching plan to grow the sport further, or the ability for players to dedicate themselves fully to their careers, there can be no true consistency to what is, right now, a fragmented system of evangelizing the sport and providing a monetary reward for playing it. One of the most difficult obstacles to overcome for American darts leagues as they battle for relevancy is that there are already so many other entertainment options sucking up real estate on television or other traditional platforms. Not the least of which is the PDC itself, which is featured on ESPN and has a preexisting fandom in the US. If someone who loves darts already has an attachment to the established world of the PDC, it\u2019s much harder to convince them to tune in for a lesser known league with unknown competitors. US leagues also generally play cricket \u2013 a game that rarely requires a set amount of time \u2013 while the PDO is structured around the more straightforward, and thus more easily televisable, game of 501. One or two games of cricket could take as long as a best-of-11-games set of 501 matches, says Sawyer, making it \u201calmost impossible to stream\u201d. If deciding between a known ratings success that can fit in a set time slot for off-peak programming and an unknown entity that can take hours upon hours to finish, the choice is a simple one. Many US organizations do stream their tournaments, mostly through a partnered streaming platform or via DartConnect scoring, an electronic platform that allows fans to track their favorite players\u2019 matches which alerts fans when they\u2019re up during a tournament. The ADO sets up DartConnect, which the PDO has also begun to employ, on up to 70 boards in a tournament, removing some of the scheduling issues and limitations of a local sport. Both leagues stream their major tournaments, the ADO its national finals in Las Vegas held every January and the ADA its regional and national finals. Remick estimates 30,000 people tuned in for the ADA Championship in Memphis this year, and that all three organizations collectively stream 10 to 15 major tournaments each year. Streaming has been a boon for the ADA, growing interest in the game on social media and increasing participation across the country. Each time a national championship visits a new city, Remick charts an increase in participation on a grassroots level. That increased participation is coming hand in hand with additional chances for existing professional players in the US to play alongside top players. The ADO sends teams to the World Cup each year. The PDC also started holding the North American Championships as the first event in the World Series of Darts, which Sawyer calls a \u201chuge improvement\u201d between the two leagues. \u201cI don\u2019t particularly see an American qualifying for the World Championships and surprising anybody at any extended level,\u201d Sawyer says. \u201cBut to be able to play for a North American Championship and a really good payday, then being able to go play in that PDC event is a big step in the right direction for them.\u201d US darts may not ever reach the soaring heights and rockstar status of its European cousin. There are still too many built-in advantages for the latter. Gambling has been legal in the UK for decades, offering a leg up when drumming up interest in competitions and results. Yet for some, it doesn\u2019t matter so much. If darts is one day a massive draw, that\u2019s great when it comes to financial opportunities for the players. But at its heart, darts has always been a local sport. For Sawyer, the personal aspect is more important than anything else. \u201cIt\u2019s part of what got me to play darts and kept me playing darts,\u201d he says. \u201cBut obviously if you keep that it\u2019s never going to be a living here. ...

Johnson has been backed by many of the \u201cSpartans\u201d in the Tory party, including the European Research Group (ERG) deputy chair Steve Baker, who refused three times to vote for Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement, and want to see it junked. But another vocal group of Conservative MPs, including Ken Clarke and Dominic Grieve, have warned they are ready to bring down a future Tory government rather than allow a no-deal Brexit. Baker hit back against Fox on Wednesday, saying: \u201cBy stating the obvious, by repeating common ground as if there were any disagreement, Liam is ludicrously tilting at windmills. He\u2019s done much to promote trade and freedom but I couldn\u2019t be more disappointed in him here.\u201d He highlighted tweets by his ERG colleague Marcus Fysh, who claimed Johnson would \u201coffer\u201d the EU a temporary, tariff-free standstill period; and expected that offer to be taken up. \u201cAs the draft withdrawal agreement will not pass, the EU will need to decide whether it wants to accept Boris\u2019s offer of zero tariff trade to continue for the time being after Brexit on 31 October,\u201d Fysh said. The two sides would then notify the WTO of their intentions, under Gatt 24. Gatt was the founding treaty of what became the World Trade Organization (WTO) \u2013 but trade experts say Gatt 24, as it is known, was only ever intended to operate where an outline trade deal has already been secured. Johnson conceded that point himself in an LBC interview on Tuesday, saying \u201cthere has to be an agreement on both sides\u201d, adding that the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, was \u201cwrong in thinking it\u2019s not an option\u201d. Johnson has won the support of the ERG by taking a firm stance on Brexit; but has also convinced moderate Tories, including the health secretary, Matt Hancock, that he will govern from the political centre ground once Britain has left the EU.",

      "bodyText": "Spanish police have arrested a member of the air force travelling with the Brazilian president\u2019s advance party for the G20 summit in Japan after 39kg of cocaine was discovered in his luggage during a stopover in Seville. A spokesman for the Guardia Civil said the man was arrested on Tuesday after his plane landed at the Andaluc\u00edan airport. \u201cThe serviceman was travelling on a military plane that had flown in from Brazil and stopped over at Seville airport en route to Tokyo,\u201d he said. \u201cThe serviceman was found to have cocaine in his hand baggage that weighed a total of 39kg. He was arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking and is currently in custody at our Seville headquarters waiting to appear before a judge.\u201d It is understood the plane was carrying a military delegation tasked with protecting the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, during the summit in the Japanese capital. Bolsonaro confirmed the news in a statement on Tuesday night, saying he had been informed of the airman\u2019s arrest by the defence minister. \u201cI immediately ordered the defence minister to cooperate with Spanish police to establish the facts and cooperate with every stage of the investigation, and to launch an investigation by the military police,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are around 300,000 men and women in the armed forces who are trained to uphold the highest principles of ethics and morality. If the airman is found to have committed a crime, he will be tried and convicted according to the law.\u201d Leaders are due to gather in Osaka on Friday and Saturday as Japan hosts its first G20 summit. As well as the main gathering, there will be meetings between finance ministers, central bank governors and foreign ministers. Earlier this month, Bolsonaro enacted drug policy designed to toughen penalties for traffickers and require users to undergo rehabilitation at private or religious centres. The new rules raise the minimum prison sentence for traffickers who lead criminal organisations from five to eight years. In addition, they reinforce the role of therapeutic communities. Specialists have argued the legislation moves Brazil in the opposite direction of many countries that try to approach addiction as a health issue. Drug users in the country previously had to agree to hospital admission, but the law now allows involuntary rehabilitation upon the recommendation of a relative or public health official.

The judges were Tim Marshall, a former diplomatic editor at Sky, Sam Taylor, editor of the Lady magazine, and Vaughan Smith, the founder of the Frontline Club.

These small black beans are available whole, split (as used by chef <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ehxcBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=vivek+singh+homely+black+lentils&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Bcik5LHF4s&amp;sig=ACfU3U3weIrOFbJyC6QDJCZuFsYF9aBgNw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwimqPHV077iAhXkVBUIHZYzBAUQ6AEwA3oECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=vivek%20singh%20homely%20black%20lentils&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">Vivek Singh in his recipe in Spice At Home</a>), and split and hulled \u2013 at which point they become known as white lentils, which are never used for black dal. Perhaps that seems obvious to you, especially if you\u2019re lucky enough to have grown up on the stuff, but staring at endless bags of beans in Drummond Street behind London\u2019s Euston station, it wasn\u2019t to me, so I offer up my own stupidity as a cautionary tale. Go for the things that look like tiny grey pebbles in the bag.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.foodepedia.co.uk/books/2013/oct/Book_review_The_Dal%20Cookbook_Krishna_Dutta.htm\" title=\"\">Krishna Dutta\u2019s gloriously comprehensive Dal Cookbook</a> includes a recipe for a Kashmiri-style dal makhani, contributed by an 80-year-old she describes as a \u201cpious Hindu\u201d, which uses five different types of dal \u2013 urad, channa, masoor, waxy toor and moong \u2013 as an \u201causpicious combination\u201d. The texture is far more varied than those using a single type, but delicious as it is, with urad dal as just one sixth of the total. It\u2019s not terribly black or, indeed, creamy, which, auspicious or not, seems a shame.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e69ce55e5c289a619cef00d894597e11c61d17c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e69ce55e5c289a619cef00d894597e11c61d17c9/0_574_2905_2905/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maunika Gowardhan\u2019s dal:\u2019.

One Delhi restaurant famously simmers it for days on end, but without the luxury of time, \u201cthe addition of a small quantity or rajma or kidney beans will give the makhani gravy its rich texture, and also a little bit of colour\u201d.</p> <p>They do indeed lend the finished dish a better colour, but neither my testers nor I think they add much else, so I\u2019m going to leave them out. However, if you do happen to have some dried kidney beans lying around in need of using up (dried beans and pulses are best used within six months of purchase, according to Dutta; the older they are the longer they will take to soften), by all means use them in place of some of the urad dal.</p> <p>I do like Gowardhan\u2019s suggestion of roughly mashing the cooked dal; in the absence of 40-odd hours to tend the dish, this is a useful shortcut for thickening the gravy.</p> <h2>The spices</h2> <p>While Dutta, Gill, Sodha and Gowardhan cook their pulses separately, Singh and <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/foodanddrink/kricket-cookbook-will-bowlby-review-a3833516.html\" title=\"\">Will Bowlby</a>, head chef at London\u2019s Kricket, simmer them with onions, chillies and spices. I find this makes them difficult to skim, and gives the onion a rather slimy consistency, but the subtle, smoky sweetness that <a href=\"http://anjalipathak.com/\" title=\"\">Anjali Pathak</a>\u2019s black cardamom and cinnamon gives the beans in her book Secrets from My Indian Family Kitchen, does appeal. If you don\u2019t happen to have them, though, don\u2019t worry \u2013 they\u2019re by no means essential.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8799898438b3e72b24e4e94845181c078e7387e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8799898438b3e72b24e4e94845181c078e7387e3/534_70_2954_2954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Romy Gill\u2019s dal uses a mixture of urad dal and kidney beans.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Romy Gill\u2019s dal makhani uses a mixture of urad dal and red kidney beans.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This isn\u2019t a dish that demands hundreds of different spices \u2013 indeed, Sodha uses just chilli powder \u2013 but warming garam masala, as used by Gill, Gowardhan and Dutta, works well with the richness of the cream, along with cumin for earthiness and coriander for zestiness \u2013 both popular ingredients in the recipes I try.</p> <p>The secret ingredient in Gill\u2019s dal, which proves the runaway winner among my testers, is methi, or fenugreek leaves, which she tells me is a typical Punjabi ingredient. They add a haunting, smoky, almost musty flavour that takes me right back to India. Do try to find them, if you can; Asian supermarkets will carry them, and they\u2019re commonly stocked in the speciality ingredients or world food aisles of large supermarkets.</p> <h2>The aromatics</h2> <p>Dutta\u2019s recipe is unique in containing no onion or garlic, which are off limits to devout Hindus (hence the asafoetida, which is often used to impart a compensatory, savoury note in their place). Everyone else adds large amounts of the latter, along with ginger, and Gowardhan, Singh, Sodha, Bowlby and Pathak also start their dals with golden, slow-cooked onions, which gives them an answering sweetness to the beans and spices. I would suggest chopping, rather than slicing them, however; the tangle of the former spoils the smoothness of the gravy for me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"aafe0af788f37f4950ec0aa2440fc5e9d84edda8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aafe0af788f37f4950ec0aa2440fc5e9d84edda8/0_504_3024_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Will Bowlby simmers his dal with onions, chillies and spices.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Will Bowlby simmers his dal with onions, chillies and spices.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fresh chillies are also common: finely chop them if you enjoy heat; slit them and remove from the dal before serving if you\u2019d prefer a milder result.</p> <h2>Tomatoes: yes or no?</h2> <p>Only Dutta leaves these out altogether; the rest of the recipes are divided fairly evenly between fresh fruit and puree \u2013 we all prefer the latter, and not just because decent fresh tomatoes are so hard to come by in the UK for most of the year. The rich, deep, cooked flavour of the puree just works better with the earthy lentils and cream.</p> <h2>The dairy</h2> <p>\u201cThe reason I say this dish is for special occasions,\u201d Gowardhan writes, \u201cis the copious quantities of butter and cream. No recipe should skimp on it, and nor will mine!\u201d Wise words: for my greedy crowd, Dutta\u2019s yoghurt just won\u2019t cut it. Sodha, interestingly, uses whole milk, simmering it down to sticky sweetness, and copious amounts of butter, but perhaps unsurprisingly, the double whammy of double cream and butter or ghee favoured by Bowlby, Singh and Gill proves the most popular.

      "bodyText": "While dal, a general word for dried lentils, pulses and beans, as well as the infinite variety of cooked dishes they\u2019re made into, is an everyday staple across the Indian subcontinent, dal makhani is, according to chef Maunika Gowardhan, \u201cin a league of its own\u201d. It\u2019s saved, in the main, for weddings and other celebrations \u2013 and not only because the longer you cook it, the better it gets. It\u2019s also unapologetically rich; makhani means \u201cbuttery\u201d in Hindi. Niki Segnit sums the spirit of the dish up perfectly in Lateral Cooking, when she describes it as \u201cthe dal equivalent of Jo\u00ebl Robuchon\u2019s famously opulent puree de pomme de terre, except you don\u2019t even have to pretend to want anything else to go with it\u201d. Meera Sodha reckons it\u2019s \u201cone of the world\u2019s finest dishes\u201d, and all you need is a little patience, and a lot of ghee. The dal Dal makhani requires urad, sometimes written as urid, dal and \u2013 I made this mistake so you don\u2019t have to \u2013 not everything labelled as such is suitable. These small black beans are available whole, split (as used by chef Vivek Singh in his recipe in Spice At Home), and split and hulled \u2013 at which point they become known as white lentils, which are never used for black dal. Perhaps that seems obvious to you, especially if you\u2019re lucky enough to have grown up on the stuff, but staring at endless bags of beans in Drummond Street behind London\u2019s Euston station, it wasn\u2019t to me, so I offer up my own stupidity as a cautionary tale. Go for the things that look like tiny grey pebbles in the bag. Krishna Dutta\u2019s gloriously comprehensive Dal Cookbook includes a recipe for a Kashmiri-style dal makhani, contributed by an 80-year-old she describes as a \u201cpious Hindu\u201d, which uses five different types of dal \u2013 urad, channa, masoor, waxy toor and moong \u2013 as an \u201causpicious combination\u201d. The texture is far more varied than those using a single type, but delicious as it is, with urad dal as just one sixth of the total. It\u2019s not terribly black or, indeed, creamy, which, auspicious or not, seems a shame. Both Gowardhan and Romy Gill, whose gloriously rich dal makhani made a big impression on me when I visited her Thornbury restaurant last year, use a mixture of urad dal and kidney beans, Gowardhan explaining that \u201curad dal is a lentil that thrives on slow cooking; the longer it cooks, the richer the dal makhani is\u201d. One Delhi restaurant famously simmers it for days on end, but without the luxury of time, \u201cthe addition of a small quantity or rajma or kidney beans will give the makhani gravy its rich texture, and also a little bit of colour\u201d. They do indeed lend the finished dish a better colour, but neither my testers nor I think they add much else, so I\u2019m going to leave them out. However, if you do happen to have some dried kidney beans lying around in need of using up (dried beans and pulses are best used within six months of purchase, according to Dutta; the older they are the longer they will take to soften), by all means use them in place of some of the urad dal. I do like Gowardhan\u2019s suggestion of roughly mashing the cooked dal; in the absence of 40-odd hours to tend the dish, this is a useful shortcut for thickening the gravy. The spices While Dutta, Gill, Sodha and Gowardhan cook their pulses separately, Singh and Will Bowlby, head chef at London\u2019s Kricket, simmer them with onions, chillies and spices. I find this makes them difficult to skim, and gives the onion a rather slimy consistency, but the subtle, smoky sweetness that Anjali Pathak\u2019s black cardamom and cinnamon gives the beans in her book Secrets from My Indian Family Kitchen, does appeal. If you don\u2019t happen to have them, though, don\u2019t worry \u2013 they\u2019re by no means essential. This isn\u2019t a dish that demands hundreds of different spices \u2013 indeed, Sodha uses just chilli powder \u2013 but warming garam masala, as used by Gill, Gowardhan and Dutta, works well with the richness of the cream, along with cumin for earthiness and coriander for zestiness \u2013 both popular ingredients in the recipes I try. The secret ingredient in Gill\u2019s dal, which proves the runaway winner among my testers, is methi, or fenugreek leaves, which she tells me is a typical Punjabi ingredient. They add a haunting, smoky, almost musty flavour that takes me right back to India. Do try to find them, if you can; Asian supermarkets will carry them, and they\u2019re commonly stocked in the speciality ingredients or world food aisles of large supermarkets. The aromatics Dutta\u2019s recipe is unique in containing no onion or garlic, which are off limits to devout Hindus (hence the asafoetida, which is often used to impart a compensatory, savoury note in their place). Everyone else adds large amounts of the latter, along with ginger, and Gowardhan, Singh, Sodha, Bowlby and Pathak also start their dals with golden, slow-cooked onions, which gives them an answering sweetness to the beans and spices. I would suggest chopping, rather than slicing them, however; the tangle of the former spoils the smoothness of the gravy for me. Fresh chillies are also common: finely chop them if you enjoy heat; slit them and remove from the dal before serving if you\u2019d prefer a milder result. Tomatoes: yes or no? Only Dutta leaves these out altogether; the rest of the recipes are divided fairly evenly between fresh fruit and puree \u2013 we all prefer the latter, and not just because decent fresh tomatoes are so hard to come by in the UK for most of the year. The rich, deep, cooked flavour of the puree just works better with the earthy lentils and cream. The dairy \u201cThe reason I say this dish is for special occasions,\u201d Gowardhan writes, \u201cis the copious quantities of butter and cream. No recipe should skimp on it, and nor will mine!\u201d Wise words: for my greedy crowd, Dutta\u2019s yoghurt just won\u2019t cut it. Sodha, interestingly, uses whole milk, simmering it down to sticky sweetness, and copious amounts of butter, but perhaps unsurprisingly, the double whammy of double cream and butter or ghee favoured by Bowlby, Singh and Gill proves the most popular. You can reduce the latter, if you like, but it seems a shame \u2013 there are thousands of great recipes for everyday dals out there (indeed, Dutta\u2019s book is stuffed full of them), but this isn\u2019t one of them. Perfect dal makhani Prep 15 min, plus soaking time Cook 50 min Serves 4-6 as a main or side 200g urad dal, whole and unhulled 1 cinnamon stick (optional) 2 black cardamom pods (optional) 5 tbsp ghee or butter 2 large onions, peeled and finely chopped 20g piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated 5 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed 2 green chillies, slit (or finely chopped, if you\u2019d like your dal hotter) 1 tsp garam masala 1 tsp ground cumin 1 tsp ground coriander \u00bd tsp Kashmiri red chilli powder 75g tomato puree 150ml double cream 2 tbsp dried fenugreek leaves Fresh coriander (optional) Soak the dal overnight, then rinse well and drain. Cover with three times as much cold water and bring to a boil. Skim, then add the cinnamon stick and cardamom pods, if using. Simmer until the beans are soft enough to crush easily against the side of the pan, topping up the water if necessary, because they should always be covered (this will probably take 45 minutes to an hour). Meanwhile, melt four tablespoons of ghee in a large frying pan over a medium heat, then gently sweat the onions until soft and golden. Stir in the ginger, garlic and green chillies, cook for another minute or so, then stir in all the dried spices apart from the fenugreek leaves, and cook, stirring, for a few minutes more. Turn down the heat and stir in first the tomato puree and then, gradually, the cream and fenugreek. Turn off the heat. When the dal is ready, drain it over a bowl, retaining the water, then roughly mash so some of the dal is squashed and some remains whole. Stir all the dal into the pan with the sauce, then, over a low heat, add just enough of the cooking water to bring it to your desired consistency \u2013 I like mine quite thick, rather than soupy. Season to taste and serve with a scattering of fresh coriander, if you like the stuff. \u2022 Dal makhani: a heart attack in healthfood\u2019s clothing, or the most delicious thing you can do with lentils?

This blockchain is held, at least in theory, by every user, in a \u201cdistributed ledger\u201d that obviates the need for a central third party authority. The purpose of this little book is to explain how the blockchain works and why it still inspires. It consists of Nakamoto\u2019s breakthrough 2008 paper Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, a guide to it by blockchain aficionado Jaya Klara Brekke, along with appendices, an introduction by James Bridle and informative essays parallelling bitcoin with the cryptographic work at Bletchley Park that helped the allies defeat the Nazis. \u201cI want to make your eyes shine in bright-eyed wonder as you reread the Bitcoin white paper, just as mine did,\u201d Brekke writes. That\u2019s the peril and pleasure of the book: her guide mixes the off-putting ardour of a doorstep God botherer with excitement over the elegance and unrealised potential of Nakamoto\u2019s idea. Bitcoin may be in the recycling bin of radical initiatives, and Nakamoto unheard of since 2014, but the blockchain idea of a self-sustaining framework for the development of consensus is still worth developing \u2013 and not just to change how we spend. In our serially disappointed age, the blockchain suggests a way better than mere cynicism about state and privacy-violating corporations, albeit one that doesn\u2019t seem ready to take over the world any time soon. \u2022 The White Paper is published by Ignota (\u00a312.99).

      "body": "<p>No one expected the final stage of the Conservative party leadership contest to be a staid and dignified affair. The Tories are now more spectacle than party, more farcical roadshow than government. But barely a week in, and it feels like events are escalating at the pace of a crammed last episode of a poorly crafted drama \u2013 the writers just want to wrap it up because they have already been told there will be no second series.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/26/mesmerising-boris-johnsons-bizarre-model-buses-claim-raises-eyebrows\">'Mesmerising': Boris Johnson's bizarre model buses claim raises eyebrows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Boris Johnson\u2019s much anticipated interviews over the past 24 hours have been a series of how-did-we-end-up-here moments. In an<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/25/boris-johnson-team-photo-partner-carrie-symonds\" title=\"\"> interview on LBC</a> yesterday, he petulantly refused to answer questions about an allegedly recent photo of him and his partner looking cosy after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/21/police-called-to-loud-altercation-at-boris-johnsons-home\" title=\"\">domestic incident</a> reported last week. \u201cWhy should I!\u201d he sulked. The rest of the time he descended into word salads and often just sounds, a harrumphing cornered animal. In another even more alarming interview, we saw Johnson talk about his supposed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/26/mesmerising-boris-johnsons-bizarre-model-buses-claim-raises-eyebrows\" title=\"\">model bus crafting hobby</a> in slow motion, his eyes glazing over. It wasn\u2019t that it had the air of something made up that was worrying, it was that he seemed to be drifting away as he was fabulating. Like a chirpy robot running out of batteries and slowing down to a drawl, Johnson\u2019s whole demeanour during the campaign so far is that of someone who has burned himself out just before destiny called. He\u2019s tired and irritated and can\u2019t keep up. His shtick, the bumbling posh boy swashbuckling act, is getting so old even he is bored of it, especially when it doesn\u2019t quite cut it when scrutiny is at full-on potential prime minister levels.</p> <p>For as long as I can remember, Johnson supporters have been telling me that it\u2019s all a clever act, that the man is an intellectual who disarms his critics in order to stealthily outwit them. Not many are saying that any more. He\u2019s not even as good as Donald Trump; his bag of base-galvanising tricks is much sparser. Business leaders (remember when they were the Tories\u2019 mates?) are now using code red language. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/26/uk-economy-cliff-edge\" title=\"\">Writing in the Guardian</a>, Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, said \u201cthe idea that Boris Johnson will become our prime minister fills me \u2013 and many other business people \u2013 with horror\u201d.</p> <p>Johnson is now nobody without the Brexit ultras of the Conservative party membership. And he knows they will see him through, so why expend any more effort than is needed? \u201cWhy should I!\u201d should be his campaign slogan.

      "bodyText": "No one expected the final stage of the Conservative party leadership contest to be a staid and dignified affair. The Tories are now more spectacle than party, more farcical roadshow than government. But barely a week in, and it feels like events are escalating at the pace of a crammed last episode of a poorly crafted drama \u2013 the writers just want to wrap it up because they have already been told there will be no second series. Boris Johnson\u2019s much anticipated interviews over the past 24 hours have been a series of how-did-we-end-up-here moments. In an interview on LBC yesterday, he petulantly refused to answer questions about an allegedly recent photo of him and his partner looking cosy after the domestic incident reported last week. \u201cWhy should I!\u201d he sulked. The rest of the time he descended into word salads and often just sounds, a harrumphing cornered animal. In another even more alarming interview, we saw Johnson talk about his supposed model bus crafting hobby in slow motion, his eyes glazing over. It wasn\u2019t that it had the air of something made up that was worrying, it was that he seemed to be drifting away as he was fabulating. Like a chirpy robot running out of batteries and slowing down to a drawl, Johnson\u2019s whole demeanour during the campaign so far is that of someone who has burned himself out just before destiny called. He\u2019s tired and irritated and can\u2019t keep up. His shtick, the bumbling posh boy swashbuckling act, is getting so old even he is bored of it, especially when it doesn\u2019t quite cut it when scrutiny is at full-on potential prime minister levels. For as long as I can remember, Johnson supporters have been telling me that it\u2019s all a clever act, that the man is an intellectual who disarms his critics in order to stealthily outwit them. Not many are saying that any more. He\u2019s not even as good as Donald Trump; his bag of base-galvanising tricks is much sparser. Business leaders (remember when they were the Tories\u2019 mates?) are now using code red language. Writing in the Guardian, Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, said \u201cthe idea that Boris Johnson will become our prime minister fills me \u2013 and many other business people \u2013 with horror\u201d. Johnson is now nobody without the Brexit ultras of the Conservative party membership. And he knows they will see him through, so why expend any more effort than is needed? \u201cWhy should I!\u201d should be his campaign slogan. This all leaves Jeremy Hunt shadow-boxing an opponent who cannot be bothered and whose temperament is so frayed he now cannot handle basic debate. And so Hunt, looking a bit lost, too scared to alienate Brexiters but also needing something to actually campaign against, gestures weakly at Johnson\u2019s evasiveness in a general \u201cthis is just not on\u201d fashion, while posting random pictures of himself on the trail eating pizza and hashtagging his every move #hastobehunt. Inspiring stuff. The Johnson campaign is now officially in so much trouble that it has hired Six Sigma saviours Iain Duncan Smith and Mark Fullbrook, the man behind Zac Goldsmith\u2019s dirty yet still unsuccessful campaign against Sadiq Khan.

This spat really isn\u2019t cricket | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Well, you get the idea with that one. It\u2019s notable that we now live in times where Boycott is lionised by some as an amusing character who\u2019d do a much better job than the politicians and so on and so on. After all, the great consensus in the old days was that Boycott knew very little about entertainment and even less about leadership. The latter quality was in particularly short supply. Of Boycott\u2019s brief England captaincy, Mike Brearley \u2013 who famously had it in spades \u2013 said: \u201cWhen he took over after I broke my arm, [Boycott] won little except the recognition he was not the man to captain England.\u201d That was the polite way of putting it; Ian Botham made a similar point by <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/604169.html\" title=\"\">running Boycott out</a> during the second Test between New Zealand and England in 1978, ending another unspeakably glacial innings. \u201cWhat have you done? What have you done?\u201d Boycott demanded <em>sotto voce</em> of Botham, who likes to say that he replied: \u201cI\u2019ve run you out, you cunt.\u201d</p> <p>Strange, even in the mad post-referendum world, to think the often haplessly self-centred Boycott is now regarded as a thought leader of sorts. This latest tirade is far from the first inkling of how post-Boycott Boycott would differ from Boycott-era Boycott. The writer Tim de Lisle once observed that Ian Botham and Boycott swapped roles in retirement. Despite having been the great showman, Botham\u2019s commentary was plodding and dreary, while the previously dour Boycott insisted on whacking every point around the ground.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet even accounting for this, I am not sure that the fabled disinhibition of old age is what lies behind Boycott\u2019s political vision for the UK as delineated on GMB this week. In fact, it is rather easier to see his whole career as being of a coherent piece when you remember it is all underpinned by the same inability to think much \u2013 or indeed anywhere \u2013 beyond what suits himself. Boycott says exactly what he pleases as long as it won\u2019t be him getting caught out by the effects of his pronouncements. And he personally would be fine in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

What\u2019s the worst that can happen, and so forth. On the other hand: who on earth is this devil\u2011may\u2011care adventurer, this fast-and-loose buccaneer, this cricketing personality type simply made to get the foam fingers wagging appreciatively at the Big Bash? Can it really be Geoff Boycott? I think it\u2019s the sheer cavalier abandon that makes you wonder what might have been. Back in the day, it often felt to cricket watchers as though Boycott was in for an entire summer, every time he was in, inching defensively and absolutely without apology toward the low 20s by lunch. \u201cIt was more of an occupation than an innings,\u201d the Times\u2019s John Woodcock wrote witheringly of one such anti-spectacle, an innings on the first day of which Boycott went a full 45 minutes without scoring, among various other lowlights. But will you just look at how he Brexits! By the seat of his actual pants. Without pants, if necessary. If only Boycott\u2019s future self could have written one of those letters to his 27-year-old self. \u201cCome on Geoffrey, my lad,\u201d this might have run. \u201cI know that right now you think people have paid their money to see you and you\u2019re keen to treat that investment with the utmost contempt, ideally by blocking your way to a joyless 50 by close of play, which will have the joint effect of letting the England selectors see exactly how you feel about their pointed call for \u2018brighter cricket\u2019. I know that right now you value being boring, technically faultless and incredibly reliable as virtues. I know you make no apologies for taking obsessive amounts of care. But listen: we won two world wars \u2013 and by the time you get to the age of 78, you\u2019re going to be one of those weirdo subclinical nostalgics who somehow reckons they actually fought in them. Let\u2019s have a bit of flair! Let\u2019s have a bit of fuck-this-for-a-game-of-soldiers! Let\u2019s have a sense of adventure and hang the consequences! I\u2019m sure you can see the long-term folly of thinking everything through as much as you do \u2026\u201d Well, you get the idea with that one. It\u2019s notable that we now live in times where Boycott is lionised by some as an amusing character who\u2019d do a much better job than the politicians and so on and so on. After all, the great consensus in the old days was that Boycott knew very little about entertainment and even less about leadership. The latter quality was in particularly short supply. Of Boycott\u2019s brief England captaincy, Mike Brearley \u2013 who famously had it in spades \u2013 said: \u201cWhen he took over after I broke my arm, [Boycott] won little except the recognition he was not the man to captain England.\u201d That was the polite way of putting it; Ian Botham made a similar point by running Boycott out during the second Test between New Zealand and England in 1978, ending another unspeakably glacial innings. \u201cWhat have you done? What have you done?\u201d Boycott demanded sotto voce of Botham, who likes to say that he replied: \u201cI\u2019ve run you out, you cunt.\u201d Strange, even in the mad post-referendum world, to think the often haplessly self-centred Boycott is now regarded as a thought leader of sorts. This latest tirade is far from the first inkling of how post-Boycott Boycott would differ from Boycott-era Boycott. The writer Tim de Lisle once observed that Ian Botham and Boycott swapped roles in retirement. Despite having been the great showman, Botham\u2019s commentary was plodding and dreary, while the previously dour Boycott insisted on whacking every point around the ground. Yet even accounting for this, I am not sure that the fabled disinhibition of old age is what lies behind Boycott\u2019s political vision for the UK as delineated on GMB this week. In fact, it is rather easier to see his whole career as being of a coherent piece when you remember it is all underpinned by the same inability to think much \u2013 or indeed anywhere \u2013 beyond what suits himself. Boycott says exactly what he pleases as long as it won\u2019t be him getting caught out by the effects of his pronouncements. And he personally would be fine in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Yes, Geoffrey Boycott is simply looking after Geoffrey Boycott. It really was ever thus.",

      "bodyText": "Subscribe now to receive the morning briefing by email. Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Deaths and protests fuel migrant detention controversy The acting head of US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has resigned amid escalating controversy over the administration\u2019s hardline immigration policies, specifically the inhumane conditions at a CBP station in Texas used to house migrant children. John Sanders, who will stand down on 5 July, gave no reason for his exit, but he recently begged Congress for extra funding to address the crisis. On Tuesday the House passed a $4.5bn emergency border aid package to care for the record numbers of migrant detainees. Tragic photo. Julia Le Duc, a reporter, photographed the bodies of a Salvadorian migrant and his daughter after they drowned on Monday trying to cross the Rio Grande to the US. It is a stark and shocking image of the migration crisis. Wayfair walkout. Hundreds of Wayfair employees are planning a walkout on Wednesday to protest against the home goods company\u2019s involvement in furnishing border camps for detained migrants. No refuge. Donald Trump has overseen the lowest refugee admission rates since the modern resettlement system was created in 1980, tearing apart a program that has transformed millions of lives, as Amanda Holpuch reports. Democrats prepare for a candidate cull after first debates The first 10 of 20 candidates who qualified for NBC\u2019s televised Democratic debates will face off in Miami on Wednesday, with Elizabeth Warren taking centre stage against rivals such as fellow US senator Cory Booker and the former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke. Thursday\u2019s second debate is expected to be a testier affair, featuring the early poll leaders Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders as well as several other top-tier candidates including Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg. Here\u2019s everything you need to know before watching. Black voters. Polls suggest the contest among Democrats to secure African American votes will be more intense and complex than in 2008 or 2016, as David Smith reports. Climate protest. Young climate protesters staged a demonstration outside DNC headquarters in Washington on Tuesday, demanding a debate focused on the climate crisis. Mueller to testify before House committees in July Robert Mueller will answer questions on his Trump-Russia investigation from the House judiciary and intelligence committees in an open session on 17 July, in what seems likely to be the most anticipated congressional hearing in years. After announcing the news on Tuesday, the intelligence committee chairman, Adam Schiff, said the special prosecutor had only reluctantly agreed to testify. Mueller suggested in a May statement that he had nothing to add to the contents of his report, saying \u201cthe report is my testimony\u201d. Obstruction of justice. The Trump White House has ordered several current and former employees to defy congressional subpoenas, but it has no sway over Mueller, who quit the justice fepartment upon completion of his investigation. Trump threatens Iran as Middle East peace plan is derided The White House\u2019s foreign policy stoked further anger on Tuesday, as Trump threatened Iran with \u201cobliteration\u201d after the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, accused him of suffering from a \u201cmental disorder\u201d \u2013 an escalating war of words that continues to raise fears of a real conflict in the region. Meanwhile in Bahrain, Jared Kushner unveiled the economic plank of his peace plan for Israel-Palestine at an event attended by neither Israeli nor Palestinian officials, to a mix of skepticism and outright derision from experts. Press secretary. Melania Trump\u2019s spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, has been named the president\u2019s new press secretary, replacing Sarah Sanders. Grisham will continue to work with the first lady and will also take on the role of White House communications director, vacated by Bill Shine in March. Crib sheet Protesters in Hong Kong have urged world leaders to address the crisis over the territory\u2019s proposed new extradition law at the G20 summit in Osaka this week, where Trump and Xi Jinping are expected to discuss the US-China trade war. Denmark has followed Finland and Sweden in becoming the third Nordic country this year to form a leftist government, under the youngest-ever Danish prime minister, the 41-year-old Social Democrat Mette Frederiksen.

Last year\u2019s performance dealt another blow to Lebedev\u2019s bank balance as Lebedev Holdings, the company that houses his media assets, including the loss-making London Live TV station, reported a pre-tax loss of \u00a318.5m. In the last two years alone, the company\u2019s total losses amount to more than \u00a336m. Revenues at London Live, which Lebedev is in talks to sell to a fellow local TV operator, fell by more than a quarter to \u00a33.1m. Earlier this year, London Live cut a quarter of its staff. The company said it had achieved a \u201cmodest improvement\u201d in operating losses at the TV station. In December, Lebedev sold 30% of Lebedev Holdings to a Saudi businessman with ties to the country\u2019s state-owned bank for \u00a325m. In 2017, Lebedev sold a stake in the digital-only Independent to the same Saudi businessman. Earlier this month, the culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, said he was \u201cminded\u201d to order regulators Ofcom and the Competition and Markets Authority to investigate the deals on public interest grounds over concerns the editorial independence of the titles could be affected.",

      "body": "<p>Andrew Scott gives a virtuosic performance in No\u00ebl Coward\u2019s imperishable 1943 comedy. He lends the hero, Garry Essendine, a mixture of twinkling charm and driving egomania characteristic of the kind of actor-manager Coward was portraying and possibly of the author himself. It is a richly funny performance even if Matthew Warchus\u2019s production occasionally displays the frenzy that seems an ingredient of modern comedy. Scott\u2019s Garry is, above all, a lost boy: a Peter Pan who has never fully grown up and who emerges from slumber sporting a piratical eyepatch and a waistcoat as if he had come from JM Barrie\u2019s Neverland rather than dreamland. But Scott also wittily lapses into an outrageous theatricality to keep people at bay. He pouts and peacocks around in order to ward off unwanted lovers and importunate playwrights and to protect the little clique of chums that is essential to his wellbeing. As in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/sep/16/design-for-living-michael-billington\">Design for Living</a> \u2013 in which Scott also starred at the Old Vic \u2013 Coward is writing about a bohemian world threatened by invasion from outsiders.</p> <p>In the original, the threat comes from a predatory female called Joanna with whom Garry sleeps in order to neutralise her capacity to upset the apple cart. Joanna here becomes Joe in the formidable shape of Enzo Cilenti and I am in two minds about the gender-swap. It heightens the idea of Garry as a sexual chameleon with the built-in ambivalence of the matinee-idol. But, given that the knock-on effect of the switch is that three of the major characters are now bisexual, you wonder why Joe is seen as a menace to Garry\u2019s tight little gang. There may be a hint of misogyny in Coward\u2019s original but there is also more dramatic logic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ab4da9f3a236f1acca7492b18daa72948483338\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ab4da9f3a236f1acca7492b18daa72948483338/517_353_5066_3040/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sexual chameleon ...

Funniest of all is his encounter with the playwright from Uckfield, Roland Maule, whom Luke Thallon invests with a lunging intensity. Prising his hand from Maule\u2019s ferocious grasp, Scott dips it in a beaker of cooling water.

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80986854\">I Think You Should Leave With Tim Robinson</a> is one of the greatest television programmes of 2019 so far. Put simply, it is a reinvigoration of the sketch show. It is short (episodes are just 15 minutes a pop), it exists on a plane of gloriously busted logic, and it is the sole reason why I haven\u2019t been able to dislodge a song about skeletons from my mind for the past six weeks.</p> <p>However, on closer inspection, I Think You Should Leave has one gaping flaw. There isn\u2019t enough of it. Sure, Netflix has recommissioned it, but that still means we won\u2019t see any more new episodes until 2020. As of now, only two hours of I Think You Should Leave exists in the world. Which is, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YDpvMYk5jA\">to quote a man more profound than I will ever be</a>, stinky.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09bbfd9153837be1f334e9ad7a0bd4b9eb272b08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09bbfd9153837be1f334e9ad7a0bd4b9eb272b08/68_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Quickly unspools into a puddle of absurdity ... Detroiters.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Quickly unspools into a puddle of absurdity ... Detroiters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Comedy Central</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, salvation of a kind still exists. I Think You Should Leave\u2019s co-creator Tim Robinson has a smattering of work to be found elsewhere. On Netflix, you can find his episode of 2016\u2019s little-loved sketch show <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkRl8fwkaqw\">The Characters</a>, which, in retrospect, was the closest thing we have to an I Think You Should Leave pilot (the opening Sammy Paradise sketch easily stands alongside anything from his newer show). But the real gold is to be found on in his sitcom Detroiters (which for UK viewers is streaming in full on <a href=\"https://www.nowtv.com/\">NowTV</a>, with episodes also available to purchase on YouTube premium and Google Play).</p> <p>In Detroiters, Robinson co-stars alongside Veep\u2019s Sam Richardson (who also appears in I Think You Should Leave\u2019s legendary Baby of the Year sketch) as ad executives who exist to serve Detroit\u2019s underperforming businesses. As premises go, it\u2019s just about as down the middle as you can get. And yet it quickly unspools into a puddle of absurdity that\u2019s just as finely honed as anything on I Think You Should Leave.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4g4WBo-5fc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M4g4WBo-5fc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The very first episode announces itself in a reasonable enough way \u2013 Robinson and Richardson interrupt a restaurant meeting to hustle for an opportunity to pitch for Chrysler \u2013 before its true nature unveils itself. The pair start throwing a ball around their office to generate ideas. The game gets ugly. Richardson bangs into a window. Robinson is amazed that it didn\u2019t break, so they start hurling larger and larger objects at it. By the time they are finished, almost half the episode has passed. By the end, the plot has petered out in favour of brilliant, joyous, stupid set-pieces.</p> <p>And this is how the series continues. They spend one episode mucking around on a motorbike; another<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQipqQR0whs\"> attempting to nail the jingle for a local wig firm</a>; another <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4g4WBo-5fc&amp;feature=youtu.be\">reacting in horror </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4g4WBo-5fc&amp;feature=youtu.be\">to a defecating car</a>. Fans of I Think You Should Leave have plenty to gnaw on here and the season one finale might just contain Tim Robinson\u2019s finest ever skeleton gag which, given that he\u2019s now technically the global poet laureate of skeleton jokes, is really saying something.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef37abbb6aa0d50c830878425e4ff626cd640859\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef37abbb6aa0d50c830878425e4ff626cd640859/126_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The best comedy of 2019 ...

Tim Robinson in I Think You Should Leave.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Only two seasons of Detroiters exist. In its day it was badly marketed and little watched; and the second season bears traces of network tinkering, with the key Robinson-Richardson relationship diluted with some less than convincing ensemble work. However, those who loved it <em>loved</em> it. At the end of last year, after Comedy Central sealed the fate of the show, <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2018/12/seth-meyers-loves-detroiters.html\">Seth Meyers used Vulture to lobby for its renewal elsewhere</a>. \u201cThere are so many wonderful comedies on television today,\u201d he wrote. \u201cShows that present new and interesting perspectives and make you think about the world in ways you never have before. Detroiters was not one of those shows. Detroiters was an old-school cackler. The only thing it ever made me think was, \u2018I can\u2019t remember the last time I laughed this hard at a television show.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Detroiters isn\u2019t quite as avant-garde as I Think You Should Leave. By necessity, the leads in a sitcom do need to sometimes appear vaguely human. As a result, there\u2019s a thick seam of dumb sweetness running right the way through it that should make it more palatable to outsiders. Detroiters exists right at the sweet spot between I Think You Should Leave and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/24/would-you-rent-a-flat-from-this-guy-meet-stath-lets-flats-fleabag-bus-rodent-jamie-demetrious-clueless-estate-agent\">Stath Lets Flats</a>. Try to tell me that it doesn\u2019t sound incredible. And did I mention the pooing car?</p>",

      "bodyText": "I Think You Should Leave With Tim Robinson is one of the greatest television programmes of 2019 so far. Put simply, it is a reinvigoration of the sketch show. It is short (episodes are just 15 minutes a pop), it exists on a plane of gloriously busted logic, and it is the sole reason why I haven\u2019t been able to dislodge a song about skeletons from my mind for the past six weeks. However, on closer inspection, I Think You Should Leave has one gaping flaw. There isn\u2019t enough of it. Sure, Netflix has recommissioned it, but that still means we won\u2019t see any more new episodes until 2020. As of now, only two hours of I Think You Should Leave exists in the world. Which is, to quote a man more profound than I will ever be, stinky. However, salvation of a kind still exists. I Think You Should Leave\u2019s co-creator Tim Robinson has a smattering of work to be found elsewhere. On Netflix, you can find his episode of 2016\u2019s little-loved sketch show The Characters, which, in retrospect, was the closest thing we have to an I Think You Should Leave pilot (the opening Sammy Paradise sketch easily stands alongside anything from his newer show). But the real gold is to be found on in his sitcom Detroiters (which for UK viewers is streaming in full on NowTV, with episodes also available to purchase on YouTube premium and Google Play). In Detroiters, Robinson co-stars alongside Veep\u2019s Sam Richardson (who also appears in I Think You Should Leave\u2019s legendary Baby of the Year sketch) as ad executives who exist to serve Detroit\u2019s underperforming businesses. As premises go, it\u2019s just about as down the middle as you can get. And yet it quickly unspools into a puddle of absurdity that\u2019s just as finely honed as anything on I Think You Should Leave. The very first episode announces itself in a reasonable enough way \u2013 Robinson and Richardson interrupt a restaurant meeting to hustle for an opportunity to pitch for Chrysler \u2013 before its true nature unveils itself. The pair start throwing a ball around their office to generate ideas. The game gets ugly. Richardson bangs into a window. Robinson is amazed that it didn\u2019t break, so they start hurling larger and larger objects at it. By the time they are finished, almost half the episode has passed. By the end, the plot has petered out in favour of brilliant, joyous, stupid set-pieces. And this is how the series continues. They spend one episode mucking around on a motorbike; another attempting to nail the jingle for a local wig firm; another reacting in horror to a defecating car. Fans of I Think You Should Leave have plenty to gnaw on here and the season one finale might just contain Tim Robinson\u2019s finest ever skeleton gag which, given that he\u2019s now technically the global poet laureate of skeleton jokes, is really saying something. Only two seasons of Detroiters exist. In its day it was badly marketed and little watched; and the second season bears traces of network tinkering, with the key Robinson-Richardson relationship diluted with some less than convincing ensemble work. However, those who loved it loved it. At the end of last year, after Comedy Central sealed the fate of the show, Seth Meyers used Vulture to lobby for its renewal elsewhere. \u201cThere are so many wonderful comedies on television today,\u201d he wrote. \u201cShows that present new and interesting perspectives and make you think about the world in ways you never have before. Detroiters was not one of those shows. Detroiters was an old-school cackler. The only thing it ever made me think was, \u2018I can\u2019t remember the last time I laughed this hard at a television show.\u2019\u201d Detroiters isn\u2019t quite as avant-garde as I Think You Should Leave. By necessity, the leads in a sitcom do need to sometimes appear vaguely human. As a result, there\u2019s a thick seam of dumb sweetness running right the way through it that should make it more palatable to outsiders. Detroiters exists right at the sweet spot between I Think You Should Leave and Stath Lets Flats. Try to tell me that it doesn\u2019t sound incredible. And did I mention the pooing car?",

Spain gave them a very tough test, providing a blueprint for others hoping to breach a defence that hadn\u2019t conceded since April. America had a huge helping of luck: watch the incident for Megan Rapinoe\u2019s second penalty over and over and from every angle and it is still hard to tell whether there was contact, or enough contact, with Rose Lavelle to warrant the spot-kick.</p> \n<h2>2) France</h2> \n<p>The hosts were unlucky to have Val\u00e9rie Gauvin\u2019s first \u2018goal\u2019 ruled out by VAR in their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/23/france-brazil-womens-world-cup-last-16-match-report\">last-16 meeting with Brazil</a>, given that the goalkeeper Barbara did not have the ball under control when Gauvin nodded it beyond her. The forward scored from a great Kadidiatou Diani cross, though. Thaisa\u2019s equaliser showed France remain vulnerable, and Griedge Mbock\u2019s goalline clearance was as magical as Amandine Henry\u2019s winner. Now France face the USA. The winner has to be favourite to lift the trophy.</p> \n<h2>3) Germany</h2> \n<p>Germany are cruising, and doing so without the talismanic Lyon midfielder Dzsenifer Marozsan, who has a broken toe. They have scored nine and conceded none on their way to a quarter-final with Sweden. The depth of their squad is scary. They had their fair share of VAR help <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/22/germany-nigeria-womens-world-cup-match-report\">against Nigeria</a> \u2013 the review upholding Alexandra Popp\u2019s header despite an offside Svenja Huth potentially obstructing the view of the keeper Chiamaka Nnadozie. Favourites for the final in the non-USA/France side of the draw.</p> \n<h2>4) England</h2> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/25/jill-scott-lionesses-mentally-strong-world-cup-quarter-final-norway\">Visits to the 'mind gym' are helping England at World Cup, says Jill Scott</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It was hard to draw conclusions from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/23/england-cameroon-womens-world-cup-last-16-match-report\">England\u2019s 3-0 defeat of Cameroon</a>. In the second half Phil Neville\u2019s defence looked particularly chaotic but given the crazy circumstances it is hard to analyse. A bottled penalty call and two possible red-card incidents could have seen the score become more emphatic but a marginal offside also saved England from a goal that would have blown the game open. Not really tested yet, and Norway will be tough.</p> \n<h2>5) Italy</h2> \n<p>If you have not fallen a little bit in love with the Italians you have not being paying enough attention. Valentina Giacinti and Aurora Galli\u2019s goals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/25/italy-china-womens-world-cup-match-report\">against China</a> showed Italy are much more than their rock-solid defence. A 20-year absence from the World Cup has been ended in style. Now they get to test their defence against some of the best forwards in the world when they face the Netherlands in Valenciennes, which will be a sea of orange. Italy, having topped their group above Australia and Brazil, have demonstrated anything is possible.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>6) Norway</h2> \n<p>The brilliantly organised Norwegians deserved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/23/norway-break-australias-hearts-in-womens-world-cup-last-16-shootout\">to progress </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/23/norway-break-australias-hearts-in-womens-world-cup-last-16-shootout\">at the expense of Australia</a>. With Caroline Graham Hansen back after an injury scare, they dominated. Hansen had 11 of Norway\u2019s 27 shots, the most by a player in any game thus far, and Sam Kerr was kept quiet by the Chelsea duo Maren Mjelde and Maria Thorisdottir. Only Elise Kellond-Knight\u2019s clever goal direct from a cornertook the game to extra time and penalties. Norway will have a field day if England\u2019s defence play as they did against Cameroon.</p> \n<h2>7) Netherlands</h2> \n<p>The European champions took on Asian champions Japan in possibly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/25/netherlands-japan-womens-world-cup-last-16-match-report\">the most exciting tie of the last 16</a>. A moment of individual magic from Lieke Martens was followed by a superb team goal from Japan. The 2011 winners should have finished off their European rivals as Mana Iwabuchi ran riot but they couldn\u2019t quite make the breakthrough and a cruel handball decision gave the the Netherlands a fortunate 90th-minute penalty. The Dutch look great going forward but remain incredibly fragile at the back.</p> \n<h2>8) Sweden</h2> \n<p>Former Chelsea goalkeeper Hedvig Lindahl was the star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/24/sweden-canada-womens-world-cup-match-report\">against Canada</a>, pulling off a stunning save to deny Manchester City\u2019s Janine Beckie a late leveller. Sweden had struggled to break down the Canada defence but Stina Blackstenius clipped the ball over Stephanie Labb\u00e9 to ensure passage. Sweden have not really been tested beyond their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/20/usa-pass-sweden-test-to-seal-top-spot-in-group-as-spain-await-in-last-16\">2-0 loss to the USA</a> in Group F.

Japan blooded youth in preparation for a home Olympics next year but having found some rhythm they will be frustrated to not have gone through. Very unlucky.</p> \n<h2>10) Spain</h2> \n<p>Like Japan, they exit with their heads high. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/25/a-soft-penalty-and-questionable-selection-the-us-got-lucky-against-spain\">extremely soft late penalty</a> that gave the USA their win was a harsh blow for a resilient side who kept the Americans from scoring from open play. They exposed a weakness in the USA\u2019s backline: press them hard and they will make mistakes. With La Liga Iberdrola pumping significant investment into the league this team will get better.</p> \n<h2>11) Brazil</h2> \n<p>It is hard not to put Brazil top for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2019/jun/24/value-it-more-marta-brazil-womens-world-cup-video\">Marta\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2019/jun/24/value-it-more-marta-brazil-womens-world-cup-video\">impassioned call to arms</a> alone.

A slightly more assured defence helped limit Norway to a single goal but they lacked fluency and service to Sam Kerr was limited. Penalty misses from Kerr and Emily Gielnik stood in stark contrast to Norway\u2019s confident conversions. Never quite met expectations.</p> \n<h2>13) Canada</h2> \n<p>The big question was why didn\u2019t Christine Sinclair take Canada\u2019s penalty, which could have levelled the score against Sweden, with 20 minutes to play? Having had one saved by Lindahl in a pre-tournament friendly she asked Beckie to oblige. Lindahl saved and Sinclair, Canada\u2019s record goalscorer, will likely always wonder what if. They struggled to score, not having enough support for Sinclair, and their defence could carry them only so far.</p> \n<h2>14) Nigeria</h2> \n<p>Unlucky to fall behind against Germany to another controversial VAR decision, having had Wendie Renard\u2019s missed penalty for France against them retaken after their keeper stepped marginally off the line.

A survey of English landlords and tenants conducted on behalf of the charity found that half of landlords do not know or understand their legal obligations. Meanwhile, renters aren\u2019t aware of their rights or don\u2019t feel able to enforce them. The result, it said, is that many tenants end up living in homes with health-affecting hazards such as mould, or dangerous problems such as missing or inoperative smoke and carbon monoxide alarms, it said. Citizens Advice on Wednesday called for a national housing body for private renting to set standards. This could include creating a home \u201cMOT\u201d, or the setting a \u201cfit-and-proper person\u201d test for landlords and standardising rental contracts, it said. Last year the Guardian revealed that 90% of local authorities had failed to use new powers to fine rogue landlords over the previous year, suggesting tenants are being failed by a lax enforcement regime. Convicted landlords who had been ruled unfit to rent out their properties were continuing to operate by exploiting loopholes in the law. Three-quarters of landlords questioned for the survey said they would be happy with a single national housing body responsible for setting standards, as it would make their job easier. The report, titled Getting the House in Order, found that landlords are not meeting obligations to make the repairs for which they are responsible. A quarter of tenants questioned by Comres said their landlord failed to carry out an annual gas safety check, or make sure smoke and carbon monoxide alarms were working. About 60% of tenants had reported a problem in their home in the past two years that had not been fixed by the landlord as it should have been.

In 2018 Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld disappeared as a result.</p>\n    <p>In terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. The likes of Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>At the same time, there is a move away from buying \u2018stuff\u2019 as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What help do retailers need?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Retailers with a high-street presence want the government to change business rates. They also want more political certainty as the potential for a no deal Brexit means some are not only incurring additional costs for stockpiling goods but are unsure about the impact of tariffs after October 2019. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges which they say put off shoppers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the government doing?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In the October 2018 budget the government announced&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/26/budget-to-offer-business-rates-relief-for-small-shops\">some relief</a>&nbsp;on business rates for independent shopkeepers. It has also set up a \u00a3675m \u2018future high streets\u2019 fund under which local councils can bid for up to \u00a325m towards regeneration projects such as refurbishing local historic buildings and improving transport links. The fund will also pay for the creation of a high street taskforce to provide expertise and hands-on support to local areas.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the outlook in 2019?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Some retailers could go under. Weakened by a difficult Christmas \u2013 which accounts for the entire annual profits of many retailers, and with further Brexit wobbles to come \u2013 retailers are facing a tough 2019. Another rise in the national minimum wage in April and the falling value of the pound against the dollar, which is used to buy goods in the far east, have also added to costs and hit profits.</p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Calling on shareholders to accept the offer, Bonmarch\u00e9 said in a statement: \u201cWhile the board\u2019s view remains that the offer does not adequately reflect the potential longer-term value of the business, the increase in uncertainty that has developed reflecting the trading and financial position of the business during the first quarter of the financial year makes the certainty represented by the offer potentially more attractive in the short term.\u201d</p> \n<p>The offer from Day, who owns more than a dozen retail brands, including Edinburgh Woollen Mill, is pitched at 11.445p a share.

      "bodyText": "Papua New Guinea\u2019s prime minister has announced a commission of inquiry into a scandalous $1.2bn loan borrowed by his predecessor\u2019s government, after an ombudsman\u2019s report made damning findings against nine individuals including himself. James Marape, prime minister for less than a month after political turmoil resulted in the resignation of Peter O\u2019Neill, was among those investigated by the ombudsman and found to have engaged in \u201cwrong and improper conduct\u201d. The damning report was tabled in parliament on Wednesday but had leaked several weeks ago. It investigated dozens of allegations, including that the entire decision-making process to obtain the loan was in breach of the PNG constitution. Marape told parliament the inquiry could include multiple law enforcement agencies. EMTV reported O\u2019Neill had told parliament he would be the first MP to testify. The ombudsman found O\u2019Neill, then prime minister, to have engaged in multiple acts which were \u201cwrong and improper\u201d, including failing to present the loan proposal to parliament as required by the PNG constitution. It found O\u2019Neill committed PNG to purchasing almost 150,000 shares in Oil Search Ltd without prior approval from the national executive committee, and that he misled the NEC to approve the loan in order to make the purchase. O\u2019Neill had strenuously fought the ombudsman\u2019s investigation into the loan, which had prompted the then treasurer Don Polye to resign out of concern. It concluded nine individuals \u201cfailed to comply with the proper process and procedures\u201d in law relating to the government\u2019s borrowing of $1.239bn from the Australian branch of Swiss bank UBS to buy almost 150,000 Oil Search Ltd shares in 2014. The decision ultimately cost the country an estimated $420m after PNG had to sell its 10% stake in the company amid a commodity prices slump. The ombudsman\u2019s report determined multiple sections of 15 individual acts were potentially breached, including six in the constitution. It was also highly critical of UBS, which is now under investigation by a Swiss regulator over its involvement in the loan, the Australian Financial Review reported. The ombudsman\u2019s report named several other ministers including Marape, then minister for finance, and Ben Micah, then minister for state investments, as engaging in conduct which was \u201cwrong and improper\u201d. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Marape, who is now prime minister, was wrong when he approved the payment deed when it was not properly established by law, a fact he was aware of at the time, the report said. \u201cWith the knowledge that his actions were improper, Hon James Marape, MP, Minister for Finance still signed and approved the Memorandum of Approval, thereby enabling the [National Petroleum Company of PNG] to enter into the Transaction Documents,\u201d it said. The ombudsman said in his opinion the NPCP\u2019s existence was questionable as it was not legally established at the time. The report also identified six others including departmental secretaries, O\u2019Neill\u2019s chief of staff, Isaac Lupari, and the governor of the central bank, Loi Bakani. It found 14 \u201cirregularities\u201d, including that the loan itself exceeded PNG\u2019s legislated GDP to debt ratio of 35% and exceeded the legislated maximum of 125% of the total value of overseas commercial debt to estimated internal revenue, that individuals engaged private lawyers without approval, and the agreement breached tendering laws and compromised PNG\u2019s sovereignty.

Laura Evelyn, an actor looking for a new place to stay, didn\u2019t like the decor particularly \u2013 the fake leather sofa and glass dining table weren\u2019t to her taste \u2013 but her would-be landlord was friendly enough. But as she was leaving the viewing, the owner handed her a sheet of paper. When Evelyn read it, she was flabbergasted. It contained a list of 31 rules that Evelyn, aged 35, would be expected to abide by if she moved in. Showers couldn\u2019t last longer than 15 minutes. She was allowed two visitors a month, who must be approved two weeks in advance. After eating, she must wash up, and immediately return to her room. And if she left dishes in the sink, she\u2019d be charged \u00a315 a pop. Probably the most shocking thing about this story was that Evelyn still considered moving in. \u201cAs a renter who had no way of buying, the housing market had me by the balls,\u201d she says. Because her \u00a3450-a-month budget was low, Evelyn\u2019s options were limited. \u201cI read [the list] with a very open mind.

      "bodyText": "The former defence minister Christopher Pyne has taken a job with consulting giant EY to help grow its defence business. The appointment was announced little more than a month after Pyne left federal parliament. Pyne \u2013 who has held the defence and defence industry portfolios \u2013 joins EY as the firm attempts to capture a bigger portion of Australia\u2019s vast and growing expenditure on defence. Pyne told the Australian Financial Review he was \u201clooking forward to providing strategic advice to EY, as the firm looks to expand its footprint in the defence industry\u201d. The consulting giant already makes enormous profit from its work for the Australian government. Tender records show in the past four years it has won 838 contracts worth $377m. That includes 138 contracts with the defence department worth $148m. More money still is available to EY through consulting for other corporations, to help them win and complete government contracts. Australia is engaged in a massive defence spend estimated at $200bn over a decade, including its new $50bn future submarines project and the $35bn future frigate project. EY is attempting to build its own defence industry capabilities to win a bigger windfall from that defence spend. Pyne will assist the firm in that effort. EY has headquartered a defence industry capability in South Australia, led by partner Mark Stewart. It also runs defence work out of Canberra. \u201cRight now the Australian government is engaged in the largest expansion of our military capability in our peacetime history \u2013 $200 billion over 10 years out to 2026 with an ambition to build Australian science, technology, engineering, innovation and industrial capability,\u201d Stewart said. Stewart said the military spending was leading to an influx of investment by multinationals seeking to win defence contracts, which provided opportunities for EY. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cEY sees a role in helping the industry aggregate but also develop their capability to win and execute on work either in their own right or with primes,\u201d he said. \u201cChristopher Pyne is also here to help lead conversations about what all states need to do to meet the challenges and opportunities this defence investment will bring.\u201d Rules can often prevent cabinet ministers from immediately working in an industry for which they have just held portfolio responsibility. The lobbying code, for example, includes an 18-month cooling-off period for ministers and parliamentary secretaries, and 12 months for senior public servants and military figures. The cooling-off period is designed to stop ministers using inside information or contacts for private benefit. But the rules, themselves weak by international standards, are barely enforced and don\u2019t apply in many cases. They would not apply to Pyne, because he is not attempting to work as a registered lobbyist with a professional lobbying firm. Even if he were to actively lobby the government on behalf of EY, Pyne would not meet the code\u2019s definition of a lobbyist, because he works directly for a corporation, rather than for a third-party professional lobbying firm. The former Labor resources minister Martin Ferguson was in a similar situation. He left parliament and soon became the chair of the advisory board to the peak body for the oil and gas industry, the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association. The code did not prevent him from doing so, because working for a peak body does not meet the definition of a registered lobbyist. The ministerial standards require that ministers do not \u201clobby, advocate or have business meetings with members of the government\u201d on any matter which they have had official dealings with in the past 18 months. Ministers are also required to undertake they will not take \u201cpersonal advantage\u201d of information they were given special access to while in office. Ministerial standards have no legal power and cannot be enforced in court. They are designed as a guide to ministerial behaviour, enforced at the discretion of the government of the day.",

The 83-year-old farmer and festival organiser, Michael Eavis, welcomed the crowds as the gates were opened. \u201cIt\u2019s never been better, it\u2019s never been as good as this one,\u201d he said. \u201cThe weather looks good \u2013 isn\u2019t that marvellous?\u201d The festival has announced it will be screening England\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup quarter-final match against Norway on Thursday, on the West Holts stage from 8pm. Another last-minute change to the schedule is that Snow Patrol were forced to pull out because band members required medical treatment for separate injuries; they have been replaced by the Charlatans.",

The state health department has scrambled to contact the 175 doctors who have trained to participate, warning them they must meet patients in person to avoid potentially breaching a 2005 commonwealth law against inciting suicide through a carriage service. The offence attracts a fine of 1,000 penalty units or $210,000 but there has never been a single prosecution since it has been on the statute books. The state health minister, Jenny Mikakos, on Wednesday announced updated legal advice that consultations via electronic means such as phones and video conferencing could be legally problematic. She said Victoria was effectively \u201cworking around the commonwealth law\u201d and she doubted any \u201cfederal prosecutor worth their salt\u201d would be pursuing it. \u201cNo one at the commonwealth level had envisaged a state parliament actually introducing voluntary assisted dying laws,\u201d she told reporters in Melbourne on Wednesday. \u201cThe risk to our clinicians \u2026 is a negligible one. But I want to ensure that there is no risk to anybody.\u201d Mikakos believes no legislative amendments will be required to the state law. The only practical implication was for people based in regional Victoria, she said. \u201cWe will assist doctors to travel to regional Victoria, to make sure they can do those face-to-face consultations,\u201d Mikakos said. Asked if family members should avoid discussing the issue by phone with terminally ill loved ones, Mikakos said it would be an \u201cabsurdity\u201d that the commonwealth law could apply in that scenario. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter I think is a real risk,\u201d she said. Victoria\u2019s parliament passed the voluntary assisted dying legislation in November 2017, after a conscience vote and a marathon parliamentary debate lasting about 100 hours. Mikakos said the interaction between this legislation and the commonwealth law didn\u2019t come up during the passage of the laws through state parliament. She declined to provide a \u201crunning commentary\u201d on the number of applications from people who are terminally ill. Last week there were reports of 100 inquiries. The Western Australian Labor government has announced plans for similar laws to Victoria, while an inquiry is underway in Queensland. Meanwhile, the Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory are fighting to regain the power to legislate on the issue.",

The $423m Paladin contract \u2013 which currently works out at a cost of at least $1,600 per day for each refugee and asylum seeker, not including food or medical care \u2013 was due to expire next week, ending the third contract extension since Paladin was engaged in late 2017. In a joint statement the Australian home affairs department and PNG\u2019s immigration and citizenship authority said the two governments had agreed to \u201ca limited extension of existing contract arrangements\u201d. In parallel they would also review whether current contract arrangements were fit for purpose. Paladin\u2019s subcontracts with other companies \u2013 most of which have also been controversial \u2013 also expire on 30 June. \u201cThe Papua New Guinea government has advised it intends to assume responsibility for service delivery and will contract local providers through an open market competitive procurement process,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWhile procurement processes take time, Australia will work with Papua New Guinea to transition to new service providers within the quickest possible time, at which time Australian-held contracts will be terminated.\u201d The extension would allow PNG authorities time \u201cto undertake its open and transparent procurement processes and to ensure services are maintained\u201d, the statement said. No further details were provided and the statement said neither government would provide \u201congoing commentary\u201d on future negotiations. The PNG government was supposed to take over garrison services for the asylum seekers and refugees sent to Manus Island by the Australian government\u2019s offshore processing regime, but at the last minute indicated it could not. The Australian government has blamed the last minute change on its decision to engage the inexperienced and little known company through a limited tender process. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, had indicated it would be extended but refused to confirm, leading to public pronouncements by PNG ministers \u2013 including the prime minister, James Marape, on Tuesday \u2013 demanding that it be handed over to the PNG government. \u201cWe don\u2019t intend to have foreign security companies engage in businesses like security which we can do,\u201d Marape said.

A key aim of the revised rules was to close the loopholes that lead to large-scale VAT fraud. This costs the EU \u20ac50bn (\u00a344.7bn) a year \u2013 that\u2019s money that funds our schools, hospitals and more.</p> <p>The proposed new rules also offer more flexibility for countries to set rates and to extend VAT exemptions \u2013 including a zero rate and some reduced rates \u2013 but the proposals are being blocked because there is still no unanimous agreement between EU countries. The UK has been one of the countries showing a reluctance to push for reforms that could provide the flexibility to reduce or zero-rate VAT for energy efficiency measures.</p> <p>But the government also likes to point towards a <a href=\"https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2015-06/cp150065en.pdf\" title=\"\">2015 European court of justice (ECJ) ruling</a>, which concluded that the reduced 5% rate of VAT on the supply and installation of energy-saving materials was in breach of EU rules. However, the ECJ also ruled that a reduced rate could apply if it was \u201cpart of a social policy\u201d.</p> <p>As unhelpful as the ECJ ruling was, there are a number of ways that the British government could have engaged constructively with it.</p> <p>First, it could have explored its breadth and almost certainly found that energy-saving materials used in home insulation do not include batteries.</p> <p>Second, it could have changed domestic legislation to defend energy efficiency as social policy \u2013 which would allow the reduced rate as the ECJ ruled. It is undisputable that reducing energy costs for poor households is a social good. Doing so would reduce the annual scandal of cold-weather deaths.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/30/two-thirds-of-britons-agree-planet-is-in-a-climate-emergency\">Two-thirds of Britons agree planet is in a climate emergency</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Third, it could have influenced the current debate over the revision to the VAT regime and supported the Greens in demanding that all products that support the sustainability transition will be zero rated for VAT. But what can we expect of a government with totally different priorities? It continues to subsidise fossil fuels, backs fracking, wants to expand airports and build more roads, blocks onshore wind power and removes incentives for solar, and has continuously frozen the fuel tax escalator while it is forcing councils to cut subsidies to bus services and presides over the most expensive railway system in Europe.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as a thoroughly pro-European party, we Greens want to see an EU-wide <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/11/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-ed-markey\" title=\"\">Green New Deal</a> that will place a social agenda at the heart of the fight against the climate emergency. This offers the prospect of a triple win: new and better jobs, improved welfare and reduced carbon emissions.</p> <p>It is hard to see how a Conservative government, gung-ho as it is for the hardest, most damaging version of Brexit, would ever engage constructively in the current debate in Europe over the revision of VAT rules. Far better for its Brexit narrative that the finger remains firmly pointed in the direction of Brussels.</p> <p>Brexit is casting its damaging shadow over important political policies and priorities. VAT on solar batteries is just one example. The government decided first to ignore the EU rules it was signed up to, then pick a fight with Brussels, then over-interpret the result of a legal case and use it to undermine support for the EU among the green lobby. In this sense it is a perfect example of how our national politics under the Tories has become subjugated to Brexit posturing while urgent environmental and social priorities are ignored.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Molly Scott Cato is Green MEP for South West England</p>",

The proposed new rules also offer more flexibility for countries to set rates and to extend VAT exemptions \u2013 including a zero rate and some reduced rates \u2013 but the proposals are being blocked because there is still no unanimous agreement between EU countries. The UK has been one of the countries showing a reluctance to push for reforms that could provide the flexibility to reduce or zero-rate VAT for energy efficiency measures. But the government also likes to point towards a 2015 European court of justice (ECJ) ruling, which concluded that the reduced 5% rate of VAT on the supply and installation of energy-saving materials was in breach of EU rules. However, the ECJ also ruled that a reduced rate could apply if it was \u201cpart of a social policy\u201d. As unhelpful as the ECJ ruling was, there are a number of ways that the British government could have engaged constructively with it. First, it could have explored its breadth and almost certainly found that energy-saving materials used in home insulation do not include batteries. Second, it could have changed domestic legislation to defend energy efficiency as social policy \u2013 which would allow the reduced rate as the ECJ ruled. It is undisputable that reducing energy costs for poor households is a social good. Doing so would reduce the annual scandal of cold-weather deaths. Third, it could have influenced the current debate over the revision to the VAT regime and supported the Greens in demanding that all products that support the sustainability transition will be zero rated for VAT. But what can we expect of a government with totally different priorities? It continues to subsidise fossil fuels, backs fracking, wants to expand airports and build more roads, blocks onshore wind power and removes incentives for solar, and has continuously frozen the fuel tax escalator while it is forcing councils to cut subsidies to bus services and presides over the most expensive railway system in Europe. Meanwhile, as a thoroughly pro-European party, we Greens want to see an EU-wide Green New Deal that will place a social agenda at the heart of the fight against the climate emergency. This offers the prospect of a triple win: new and better jobs, improved welfare and reduced carbon emissions. It is hard to see how a Conservative government, gung-ho as it is for the hardest, most damaging version of Brexit, would ever engage constructively in the current debate in Europe over the revision of VAT rules. Far better for its Brexit narrative that the finger remains firmly pointed in the direction of Brussels. Brexit is casting its damaging shadow over important political policies and priorities. VAT on solar batteries is just one example. The government decided first to ignore the EU rules it was signed up to, then pick a fight with Brussels, then over-interpret the result of a legal case and use it to undermine support for the EU among the green lobby. In this sense it is a perfect example of how our national politics under the Tories has become subjugated to Brexit posturing while urgent environmental and social priorities are ignored. \u2022 Molly Scott Cato is Green MEP for South West England",

But he added: \u201cThe idea that Jeremy doesn\u2019t make his own decisions is laughable.\u201d The spokesman said Corbyn was continuing to consult with trade unions and members of Labour\u2019s national executive committee about the party\u2019s Brexit policy. \u201cJeremy is trying to make sure that there is wide consultation in the Labour movement. That includes the affiliated trades unions who have 49% of the vote at Labour party conference, and they are a vital part of our party. \u201cIt\u2019s a consultation to try and find a position that the party can unite around.\u201d He said that process would be completed \u201cin the next few weeks\u201d. He said there was already a consensus over avoiding a no-deal Brexit and over the shift towards advocating a public vote on any deal, as announced by Corbyn after last month\u2019s European elections. But he added that there was still no agreement about what could be on the ballot paper in any referendum Labour might support, and whether the party would now commit to campaign for remain. He added that a referendum was \u201cnot the only part of our policy on Brexit. We want to see a general election. We want to see a public vote on any deal. Our alternative compromise plan is still on the table.\u201d Beckett declined to say which advisers and Labour figures she was talking about. Shadow cabinet ministers had been expecting Labour\u2019s position to move to full backing for a remain position in a second referendum at a meeting on Tuesday. But Corbyn is understood to have told shadow cabinet ministers there would be further consultation with unions and a decision on the next step in the coming weeks, to the frustration of several present including the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell. Sources in the room said McDonnell had said he was \u201cunder the impression we were making the decision today\u201d on how to advance Labour\u2019s position. The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, also questioned why a decision was not being taken and said it was \u201cabout showing leadership\u201d. \u201cBasically, Unite stepped in yesterday and put the brakes on,\u201d one shadow cabinet source said. McDonnell \u201cis obviously trying to push us forward but Loto [the leader\u2019s team] are pushing back\u201d. Speaking at a car industry conference on Tuesday, McDonnell was asked directly whether the Labour party was campaigning for a second referendum. \u201cWell, I\u2019m arguing the case,\u201d he replied. \u201cThe discussion we are having in the Labour party now, and it is no secret, is what would our attitude be if there is a referendum? \u201cI\u2019ve said personally I\u2019d vote for remain. I campaigned for remain because I can\u2019t see anything better than what we have got at the moment. I can see the consequences in terms of jobs and living standards.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>A headpiece made of fresh flowers, a panama worn with flares and aviators, a dinky knitted circular crown. According to fashion week, the new point of interest in menswear for 2020 is all happening up top..</p> <p>Despite the burst of interest in caps and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/mar/13/from-fishermen-to-ravers-why-we-cant-kick-the-bucket-hat\" title=\"\">bucket hats</a> recently, the concept of a more decorative designer hat hasn\u2019t looked this likely to take off in years. But the message from the latest round of menswear shows, which wrapped at the weekend in Paris, is that the hat is likely to become a major style statement.</p> <p>For most luxury fashion houses, the bankable accessory of the past decade has been the cult designer sneaker, exemplified by the bestselling, super-chunky Triple S by Balenciaga, which also led the recent \u201cdad trainer\u201d trend. The new collections still had showy sports shoes in abundance, but the presence of striking headwear naturally shifts the eye skyward. One explanation is that with trousers becoming increasingly long and wide \u2013 from Dunhill to Saint Laurent \u2013 you can\u2019t actually see what\u2019s on your feet anyway.</p> <p>Stephen Jones, one of fashion\u2019s most prolific milliners, who counts Rihanna, Lady Gaga and the Duchess of Sussex as former clients, created the hats for Kim Jones (no relation) at Dior Men\u2019s in Paris.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3feabc0f7b633ea24129a339fe9a1f980196d86d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3feabc0f7b633ea24129a339fe9a1f980196d86d/0_48_5255_3153/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The GQ Style editor-in-chief, Luke Day.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The GQ Style editor, Luke Day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Vierig/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cEverybody wears shoes. Not everybody wears hats,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a signifier of fashion, and as something so visible, there\u2019s nothing like a hat. You can wear a very unusual pair of shoes, but people don\u2019t necessarily see those when you walk into a room, whereas even a simple hat is seen.\u201d</p> <p>This latest Dior Men\u2019s collection was a collaboration with the American artist Daniel Arsham \u2013 himself a hat-wearer. Jones created a small selection of styles for the show, including an \u201cembroidered painter\u2019s canvas visor\u201d featuring quartz, echoing the set that Arsham had created for the show, with giant sculptures spelling out \u201cDior\u201d. Jones adds: \u201cThings go in cycles. But I think designers are now realising the power of a hat and how different and individual it makes their collections look.\u201d</p> <p>The latest advertising campaign from the ever-influential designer Raf Simons is also headgear-orientated, featuring a distinctive scaled-up riding hat. Simons went hard on this type of hat in his autumn/winter 2019 collection; all 50 looks shown in a Parisian ballroom in January were completed with a variation on this theme.</p> <p>At JW Anderson, designer Jonathan Anderson\u2019s woollen doughnut hats mirrored the craft-like knits worn on the body, while adding a certain jolliness. Ditto the oddball, all-shapes-and-sizes hats that Francesco Risso at Marni commissioned artist Shalva Nikvashvili to make from discarded leather and rubbish, ticking the current vogue in fashion for creative ideas around recycling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3bd3fb0f4d5d7c395b0bea8472f856f5639294a5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3bd3fb0f4d5d7c395b0bea8472f856f5639294a5/0_77_2833_1700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fendi, SS20 Milan fashion week men\u2019s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fendi, SS20 Milan fashion week men\u2019s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pixelformula/SIPA/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, the super-luxury labels Fendi and Louis Vuitton channelled gardening \u2013 cue hats galore. In Milan, Fendi closed its show (designed in collaboration with the Oscar-winning film director Luca Guadagnino) with a denim jumpsuit and curvy brimmed number with its FF logo woven into it. Virgil Abloh at Vuitton cited Jamiroquai in his show notes where a monogrammed PVC rain hat and lilac straw technical gardening hat were both featured.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8f0d29dd52ead857c5661389d543f1a1e70eae4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f0d29dd52ead857c5661389d543f1a1e70eae4a/0_0_2464_2463/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hat-wearing singer Jay Kay of Jamiroquai in 1999.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hat-wearing singer Jay Kay of Jamiroquai in 1999.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hayley Madden/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sources of hat inspiration were broad and varied. The up-and-coming Swedish/Kurdish label Namacheko, designed by the brother-and-sister duo Dilan and Lezan Lurr, cited nuns\u2019 veils and Asian rice hats as inspirations for their designs, which featured scalloped fronts and headscarf backs. The new designer at Lanvin, Bruno Sialelli, presented a series of individually hand painted bicorn straw hats that were \u201cinspired by the kind of souvenir hats that you give to kids, with beautiful landscapes of a dream location\u201d, he said backstage.</p> <p>Hat statements were also notable on the front row. The GQ Style editor, Luke Day, has been photographed for the past month in a variety of headwear, including a wide-brim style similar to that shown on the Saint Laurent runway in LA a few weeks ago. \u201cMine is a $15 LA lifeguard hat I got on Venice Beach,\u201d Day says. \u201cI\u2019m really into hats right now.

      "bodyText": "A headpiece made of fresh flowers, a panama worn with flares and aviators, a dinky knitted circular crown. According to fashion week, the new point of interest in menswear for 2020 is all happening up top.. Despite the burst of interest in caps and bucket hats recently, the concept of a more decorative designer hat hasn\u2019t looked this likely to take off in years. But the message from the latest round of menswear shows, which wrapped at the weekend in Paris, is that the hat is likely to become a major style statement. For most luxury fashion houses, the bankable accessory of the past decade has been the cult designer sneaker, exemplified by the bestselling, super-chunky Triple S by Balenciaga, which also led the recent \u201cdad trainer\u201d trend. The new collections still had showy sports shoes in abundance, but the presence of striking headwear naturally shifts the eye skyward. One explanation is that with trousers becoming increasingly long and wide \u2013 from Dunhill to Saint Laurent \u2013 you can\u2019t actually see what\u2019s on your feet anyway. Stephen Jones, one of fashion\u2019s most prolific milliners, who counts Rihanna, Lady Gaga and the Duchess of Sussex as former clients, created the hats for Kim Jones (no relation) at Dior Men\u2019s in Paris. \u201cEverybody wears shoes. Not everybody wears hats,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a signifier of fashion, and as something so visible, there\u2019s nothing like a hat. You can wear a very unusual pair of shoes, but people don\u2019t necessarily see those when you walk into a room, whereas even a simple hat is seen.\u201d This latest Dior Men\u2019s collection was a collaboration with the American artist Daniel Arsham \u2013 himself a hat-wearer. Jones created a small selection of styles for the show, including an \u201cembroidered painter\u2019s canvas visor\u201d featuring quartz, echoing the set that Arsham had created for the show, with giant sculptures spelling out \u201cDior\u201d. Jones adds: \u201cThings go in cycles. But I think designers are now realising the power of a hat and how different and individual it makes their collections look.\u201d The latest advertising campaign from the ever-influential designer Raf Simons is also headgear-orientated, featuring a distinctive scaled-up riding hat. Simons went hard on this type of hat in his autumn/winter 2019 collection; all 50 looks shown in a Parisian ballroom in January were completed with a variation on this theme. At JW Anderson, designer Jonathan Anderson\u2019s woollen doughnut hats mirrored the craft-like knits worn on the body, while adding a certain jolliness. Ditto the oddball, all-shapes-and-sizes hats that Francesco Risso at Marni commissioned artist Shalva Nikvashvili to make from discarded leather and rubbish, ticking the current vogue in fashion for creative ideas around recycling. Meanwhile, the super-luxury labels Fendi and Louis Vuitton channelled gardening \u2013 cue hats galore. In Milan, Fendi closed its show (designed in collaboration with the Oscar-winning film director Luca Guadagnino) with a denim jumpsuit and curvy brimmed number with its FF logo woven into it. Virgil Abloh at Vuitton cited Jamiroquai in his show notes where a monogrammed PVC rain hat and lilac straw technical gardening hat were both featured. Sources of hat inspiration were broad and varied. The up-and-coming Swedish/Kurdish label Namacheko, designed by the brother-and-sister duo Dilan and Lezan Lurr, cited nuns\u2019 veils and Asian rice hats as inspirations for their designs, which featured scalloped fronts and headscarf backs. The new designer at Lanvin, Bruno Sialelli, presented a series of individually hand painted bicorn straw hats that were \u201cinspired by the kind of souvenir hats that you give to kids, with beautiful landscapes of a dream location\u201d, he said backstage. Hat statements were also notable on the front row. The GQ Style editor, Luke Day, has been photographed for the past month in a variety of headwear, including a wide-brim style similar to that shown on the Saint Laurent runway in LA a few weeks ago. \u201cMine is a $15 LA lifeguard hat I got on Venice Beach,\u201d Day says. \u201cI\u2019m really into hats right now. My summer looks are fairly simple, so the addition of a hat just makes it that bit extra.\u201d He travelled with five Mexican western hats in various colours for fashion week. \u201cMy cowboy vibe has gone less hustler and more Dallas, like JR Ewing at the Oil Baron\u2019s Ball,\u201d he quipps. The designer Spencer Phipps was sporting a cowboy hat at a fashion-week party in Paris, while the photographer Darren Gerrish is rarely out of a hat and has been a fan since childhood. He says his favourite style is the beret, and that he has nine in rotation. \u201cFor me, it is everything \u2013 I can wear it with a casual look, a suit or black tie. It defines me. It\u2019s my armour,\u201d he says. His go-to place to buy them is Laulh\u00e8re in Paris, a tip he was given by Stephen Jones. The men\u2019s headwear trend is also bubbling on the high street \u2013 Zara has several straw styles for \u00a36 upwards while Reiss has a baker-boy cap for \u00a335. James Lawrence, the head of menswear design at Asos, says the label has sold 150,000 hats this season to date, with bucket styles leading the charge. He says that headwear has been \u201cup-trending\u201d for a while because men now feel they can wear hats to all occasions and it \u201cdoesn\u2019t feel as contrived as it once did. Hats are now used to complete your look, rather than just being practical.\u201d \u201cPeople are embracing the hat a lot more, especially men, who are gaining confidence in their style,\u201d says Nick Fouquet, a hat designer who set up his label in 2013 and includes Keith Richards as a fan. \u201cA lot of athletes, especially basketball players, are leading the way and inspiring the fashion landscape with their attire and outfits.\u201d Like Jones, he believes that a hat can make far more of a statement than a pair of sneakers. Damien Paul, head of menswear at Matchesfashion.com, says hat sales are up over 150% compared with last year, with fedoras, panamas, bucket hats and summer beanies all performing well. \u201cFor autumn, we have more than 300 styles from designer names and more niche artisanal brands,\u201d he says. For further hat inspiration, look no further than Willem Dafoe as Vincent van Gogh in Julian Schnabel\u2019s excellent At Eternity\u2019s Gate. The actor offers a masterclass in how to wear, among other head attire, the now-trending wide-brimmed straw number. He looks spectacular.",

      "bodyText": "The Austrian identitarian leader, Martin Sellner, has been subjected to further searches by Austrian police in connection with the Christchurch shooter, according to Austrian media reports and videos on Sellner\u2019s own YouTube channel. The investigation has also reportedly widened to include Sellner\u2019s US-based fiancee, Brittany Pettibone, and her own alleged connections with Australian far-right figure Blair Cottrell. Austrian newspaper Die Presse reported on 18 June that two apartments in Vienna were searched by the prosecutor\u2019s office in Graz, which has been investigating Sellner\u2019s connections to the Australian, Brenton Tarrant, who is currently on trial for the murder of 51 people in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March.

Another newspaper, Der Standard, reported that the investigation had widened to include Sellner\u2019s \u201cpartner\u201d. Sellner\u2019s fiancee, prominent far-right YouTuber and author Brittany Pettibone, announced on her own Twitter account on 18 June that she had been notified she was under investigation. According to Pettibone, the reason was an interview she had done with Cottrell in January 2018. That interview is still available on \u201calt-tech\u201d video platform, BitChute.

Sellner and Austrian prosecutors did not respond to requests for comment. When contacted, Brittany Pettibone declined to comment on the developments. When asked if they were aware of investigations into a possible organisational connection between Tarrant and Sellner, New Zealand police said via email they were making \u201ca large number enquiries, both across New Zealand and internationally\u201d but they were \u201cnot in a position to go into specifics around those enquiries\u201d. In March, Austrian authorities commenced their investigation of Sellner\u2019s connections with the Christchurch killer after it emerged that he had received a donation from Tarrant. Last month, authorities revealed that contacts between the two men had been even more extensive, involving friendly email exchanges and an invitation by Sellner for Tarrant to join him in a beer or coffee if he ever came to Austria. Sellner\u2019s immigration status in the US, where he had planned to marry Pettibone this summer, was changed following that disclosure, preventing him from entering the country. Pettibone was the focus of controversy last month after she presented Sellner\u2019s case to a meeting of a local Republican party branch in Idaho, where she lives.

      "body": "<p>In 1929 Laura Cumming\u2019s mother Betty was kidnapped from a beach in Lincolnshire. It was autumn, with few people around, but after \u201ca prolonged moment of parental inattention\u201d, the three-year-old had gone. The police were called to investigate but no one in the village of Chapel St Leonard had seen anything. For Betty\u2019s parents, Veda (who had taken her to the beach) and George (summoned from where he had got to that week in his job as a travelling salesman), the next few days were a nightmare. But this wasn\u2019t an abduction like James Bulger\u2019s or Madeleine McCann\u2019s. Not only did Betty turn up safe, in a house 12 miles inland. The circumstances that led to her being snatched were shrouded in secrets and lies. Until Veda and George adopted her, just a few weeks previously, Betty had been called Grace. The person who took her was a relative, not a stranger. And far from knowing nothing, people locally \u2013 locked in \u201cacts of communal silence\u201d that would continue for decades \u2013 knew far more than they let on.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Revelations keep on coming right to the end, with each new twist forcing Cumming to reappraise the story</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The drama of Betty\u2019s disappearance makes a brilliant opening chapter. But Cumming\u2019s mother (now in her early 90s) has no memory of her first three years and didn\u2019t learn about the kidnapping for half a century. The real story of the book isn\u2019t how she was taken from Chapel Sands but what was taken from her: the truth about who her parents were and why she was adopted; the reason a woman approached her in her teens and said: \u201cYour grandmother wants to see you,\u201d when the only grandmother she had known was dead. The book is a series of revelations: one twist the reader may foresee early on (just as Betty herself guessed it as a teenager), but most come out of the blue. They keep on coming right to the end, with each new surprise forcing Cumming to reappraise the story and to modify her views of the protagonists, not least George.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"51732fc6d76a5d4703b0fa2c51d71a459caa5f32\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51732fc6d76a5d4703b0fa2c51d71a459caa5f32/0_0_2124_3036/700.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Betty\u2019s warmth, articulacy and survival instincts shine through.\u2019\" width=\"700\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Betty\u2019s warmth, articulacy and survival instincts shine through.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Penguin Random House</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To begin with he\u2019s the villain of the piece, because of the loveless regime in which Betty was brought up. After the kidnapping, he kept her on a tight leash. She wasn\u2019t allowed to play with other children or walk the half mile to the shops; by the age of 10, she had travelled no further than Skegness, seven miles away. At home he barked out brisk instructions: sit up straight, don\u2019t play with your food, finish what\u2019s on your plate. He and Veda were already 49 when Betty came to them and, with a short temper made worse by his bronchitis and lumbago, he hadn\u2019t the temperament to give her the love she needed. Nor had the gentle, self-effacing Veda the temperament to withstand his tyranny.</p> <p>Or so Cumming infers from the memoir she persuaded her mother to write about her childhood (generous extracts from it are quoted as evidence). The low point came when George removed Betty from Skegness Grammar School, to which she had won a scholarship at 10 and where, despite her shyness, she had begun to flourish in drama and art. School was a blessed escape from George but when she was 16 he curtailed that freedom by installing her at the village post office, where she worked for 18 months in a windowless cubicle, more cut off from the world than ever. She did eventually get away to art college, first in Nottingham then in Edinburgh, where she married. She slipped her name, too, dropping Betty in favour of Elizabeth. Her relationship with George didn\u2019t recover. When he died a few years later, she skipped the funeral.</p> <p>Then again, life for George \u2013 an orphan at 13 \u2013 had been miserable, too. He scraped a living selling industrial soaps and was looked down on by his snooty brother-in-law, Captain Green (husband of Veda\u2019s younger sister), from whom he rented a modest terraced house. The Captain\u2019s own house, a vast mansion overlooking the sea, was just up the road. More to the point, George cared enough about Betty to make some lovely toys for her, including a miniature theatre.

      "bodyText": "In 1929 Laura Cumming\u2019s mother Betty was kidnapped from a beach in Lincolnshire. It was autumn, with few people around, but after \u201ca prolonged moment of parental inattention\u201d, the three-year-old had gone. The police were called to investigate but no one in the village of Chapel St Leonard had seen anything. For Betty\u2019s parents, Veda (who had taken her to the beach) and George (summoned from where he had got to that week in his job as a travelling salesman), the next few days were a nightmare. But this wasn\u2019t an abduction like James Bulger\u2019s or Madeleine McCann\u2019s. Not only did Betty turn up safe, in a house 12 miles inland. The circumstances that led to her being snatched were shrouded in secrets and lies. Until Veda and George adopted her, just a few weeks previously, Betty had been called Grace. The person who took her was a relative, not a stranger. And far from knowing nothing, people locally \u2013 locked in \u201cacts of communal silence\u201d that would continue for decades \u2013 knew far more than they let on. The drama of Betty\u2019s disappearance makes a brilliant opening chapter. But Cumming\u2019s mother (now in her early 90s) has no memory of her first three years and didn\u2019t learn about the kidnapping for half a century. The real story of the book isn\u2019t how she was taken from Chapel Sands but what was taken from her: the truth about who her parents were and why she was adopted; the reason a woman approached her in her teens and said: \u201cYour grandmother wants to see you,\u201d when the only grandmother she had known was dead. The book is a series of revelations: one twist the reader may foresee early on (just as Betty herself guessed it as a teenager), but most come out of the blue. They keep on coming right to the end, with each new surprise forcing Cumming to reappraise the story and to modify her views of the protagonists, not least George. To begin with he\u2019s the villain of the piece, because of the loveless regime in which Betty was brought up. After the kidnapping, he kept her on a tight leash. She wasn\u2019t allowed to play with other children or walk the half mile to the shops; by the age of 10, she had travelled no further than Skegness, seven miles away. At home he barked out brisk instructions: sit up straight, don\u2019t play with your food, finish what\u2019s on your plate. He and Veda were already 49 when Betty came to them and, with a short temper made worse by his bronchitis and lumbago, he hadn\u2019t the temperament to give her the love she needed. Nor had the gentle, self-effacing Veda the temperament to withstand his tyranny. Or so Cumming infers from the memoir she persuaded her mother to write about her childhood (generous extracts from it are quoted as evidence). The low point came when George removed Betty from Skegness Grammar School, to which she had won a scholarship at 10 and where, despite her shyness, she had begun to flourish in drama and art. School was a blessed escape from George but when she was 16 he curtailed that freedom by installing her at the village post office, where she worked for 18 months in a windowless cubicle, more cut off from the world than ever.

For her and her colleagues, responses like that are invaluable. \u201cJust that one comment can make a difference. My job as experience coordinator involves a lot of work; it\u2019s a big role. So it\u2019s good to get encouragement.\u201d Belong\u2019s vision is that those in care must be given more skills. \u201cNormally when people go into care, they\u2019re de-skilled, everything is done for them,\u201d says Ravenscroft. \u201cBut here at Belong we want to do the opposite.There are just no boundaries on what they can do.\u201d While Ravenscroft was sad to see the spring arts programme come to an end, she is confident that the seeds have been sown at Crewe, as both staff and residents continue to develop the skills they learned. For the customers, these included sculpture, painting, photo editing and dance. For the staff, it was the variety of ways art can be used to improve residents\u2019 memories and lifestyles. \u201cThese artists have completely changed our perception of what art can be,\u201d says Ravenscroft. \u201cHopefully we can keep sustaining these skills and eventually we might have permanent artists in residence.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Donald Trump once boasted he could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot someone without losing any votes. While this thesis hasn\u2019t been tested \u2013 yet \u2013 I suspect he\u2019s probably right. Just look at the muted reaction to the allegations the president once sexually assaulted a woman on Fifth Avenue. Just look at the depressing and predictable way the E Jean Carroll story is fizzling out.</p> <p>On Friday, New York magazine published an <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2019/06/donald-trump-assault-e-jean-carroll-other-hideous-men.html\">excerpt</a> from Carroll\u2019s forthcoming book in which the writer recalls encountering Trump in Bergdorf Goodman, a Manhattan department store, in the mid-1990s. Carroll <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/21/donald-trump-sexual-assault-allegation-e-jean-carroll-new-york-latest-accusation\">alleges</a> that Trump violently forced himself upon her in a dressing room after asking for advice on a present he was getting for a female friend. \u201cI have never had sex with anybody ever again,\u201d she wrote.</p> <p>There was a time when an allegation that the president of the United States raped someone in a department store would have been the only thing everyone was talking about. But Carroll\u2019s story was received by many media outlets with a series of tired shrugs. It <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2019/06/22/major-newspapers-largely-leave-new-report-sexual-assault-trump-their-front-pages/224009\">didn\u2019t even make the front page</a> of Saturday\u2019s New York Times, Wall Street Journal, LA Times or Chicago Tribune. Worse, the Times seemingly didn\u2019t even consider it \u201cnews\u201d \u2013 it put the story in its <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jbenton/status/1142267159277645825\">book section</a>.</p> <p>Why the relative quiet around such a big story? Is the media afraid of the president? Is it afraid of losing access or incurring Trump\u2019s wrath? Absolutely not, says Dean Baquet, the New York Times\u2019 executive editor. On Monday Baquet <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/24/reader-center/e-jean-carroll-trump-allegations.html\">addressed</a> criticism that the Times hadn\u2019t adequately covered the story by stating the paper could not find independent sources to verify Carroll\u2019s account. \u201cWe were overly cautious,\u201d Baquet said. Funny how some stories seem to demand an overabundance of caution and <a href=\"https://thinkprogress.org/hope-hicks-new-york-times-maggie-haberman-donald-trump-house-democrats-ac69fead55d5/\">others don\u2019t</a>.</p> <p>To be fair, it wasn\u2019t just media outlets that reacted to Carroll\u2019s accusations with subdued shrugs. When I first read the New York magazine I was shocked at how little I was shocked by it. The news is exhausting and I\u2019m sure many of us suffer from outrage fatigue. America is locking kids in filthy cages, and private companies are <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/immigration-border-crisis/trump-admin-s-tent-cities-cost-more-keeping-migrant-kids-n884871\">profiting from it.</a> The world is hurtling towards a climate catastrophe, and the Trump administration is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/23/mike-pence-climate-crisis-threat\">looking the other way</a>. Every day seems to bring some new nightmare; it is inevitable we become numbed to it.</p> <p>And then, of course, you\u2019ve got the fact that Carroll is the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/21/18701098/trump-accusers-sexual-assault-rape-e-jean-carroll\">22nd</a><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/21/18701098/trump-accusers-sexual-assault-rape-e-jean-carroll\"> woman</a> to publicly accuse Trump of sexual misconduct. And the fact that Trump has publicly boasted about grabbing women without their consent. And the fact that his ex-wife, Ivana Trump, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/21/18701098/trump-accusers-sexual-assault-rape-e-jean-carroll\">accused him of rape</a>. (She later said she did not mean it in \u201ca literal or criminal sense\u201d.) And the fact that every time he is accused of sexual misconduct, Trump brushes off the accusations in exactly the same way. He accuses the women of lying; he accuses them of being motivated by fame; and he threatens them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump has used this 'she\u2019s not attractive enough to be raped' defense before; it\u2019s one of his favourites</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Trump ran through this tried and tested response on Friday <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LauraLitvan/status/1142179819075121154\">in a statement</a> smearing Carroll and stating that: \u201cIf anyone has information that the Democratic Party is working with Ms Carroll or New York Magazine, please notify us as soon as possible. The world should know what\u2019s really going on. It is a disgrace and people should pay dearly for such false accusations.\u201d In other words, the president of the United States threatened a private citizen.</p> <p>On Monday, Trump further denied the allegations, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/450116-trump-vehemently-denies-e-jean-carroll-allegation-shes-not-my-type\">telling</a> the Hill that Carroll wasn\u2019t his \u201ctype\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump once boasted he could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot someone without losing any votes. While this thesis hasn\u2019t been tested \u2013 yet \u2013 I suspect he\u2019s probably right. Just look at the muted reaction to the allegations the president once sexually assaulted a woman on Fifth Avenue. Just look at the depressing and predictable way the E Jean Carroll story is fizzling out. On Friday, New York magazine published an excerpt from Carroll\u2019s forthcoming book in which the writer recalls encountering Trump in Bergdorf Goodman, a Manhattan department store, in the mid-1990s. Carroll alleges that Trump violently forced himself upon her in a dressing room after asking for advice on a present he was getting for a female friend. \u201cI have never had sex with anybody ever again,\u201d she wrote. There was a time when an allegation that the president of the United States raped someone in a department store would have been the only thing everyone was talking about. But Carroll\u2019s story was received by many media outlets with a series of tired shrugs. It didn\u2019t even make the front page of Saturday\u2019s New York Times, Wall Street Journal, LA Times or Chicago Tribune. Worse, the Times seemingly didn\u2019t even consider it \u201cnews\u201d \u2013 it put the story in its book section. Why the relative quiet around such a big story? Is the media afraid of the president? Is it afraid of losing access or incurring Trump\u2019s wrath? Absolutely not, says Dean Baquet, the New York Times\u2019 executive editor. On Monday Baquet addressed criticism that the Times hadn\u2019t adequately covered the story by stating the paper could not find independent sources to verify Carroll\u2019s account. \u201cWe were overly cautious,\u201d Baquet said. Funny how some stories seem to demand an overabundance of caution and others don\u2019t. To be fair, it wasn\u2019t just media outlets that reacted to Carroll\u2019s accusations with subdued shrugs. When I first read the New York magazine I was shocked at how little I was shocked by it. The news is exhausting and I\u2019m sure many of us suffer from outrage fatigue. America is locking kids in filthy cages, and private companies are profiting from it. The world is hurtling towards a climate catastrophe, and the Trump administration is looking the other way. Every day seems to bring some new nightmare; it is inevitable we become numbed to it. And then, of course, you\u2019ve got the fact that Carroll is the 22nd woman to publicly accuse Trump of sexual misconduct. And the fact that Trump has publicly boasted about grabbing women without their consent. And the fact that his ex-wife, Ivana Trump, accused him of rape. (She later said she did not mean it in \u201ca literal or criminal sense\u201d.) And the fact that every time he is accused of sexual misconduct, Trump brushes off the accusations in exactly the same way. He accuses the women of lying; he accuses them of being motivated by fame; and he threatens them. Trump ran through this tried and tested response on Friday in a statement smearing Carroll and stating that: \u201cIf anyone has information that the Democratic Party is working with Ms Carroll or New York Magazine, please notify us as soon as possible. The world should know what\u2019s really going on. It is a disgrace and people should pay dearly for such false accusations.\u201d In other words, the president of the United States threatened a private citizen. On Monday, Trump further denied the allegations, telling the Hill that Carroll wasn\u2019t his \u201ctype\u201d. Because men obviously only sexually assault women who are their type. Trump has used this \u201cshe\u2019s not attractive enough to be raped\u201d defense before; it\u2019s one of his favourites. \u201cBelieve me, she would not be my first choice,\u201d Trump said in 2016, after Jessica Leeds accused him of groping her on a plane in the 1980s.

Since October, the US has admitted just 14,808 refugees and is projected to have allowed in just 22,000 before the end of the fiscal year in September. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/19/people-will-die-obama-official-warns-after-trump-slashes-refugee-numbers\">In fiscal year 2018</a>, it admitted 22,491 people.</p> <p>Those shrinking numbers represent more separated families and more countries able to justify lowering their own resettlement numbers. In human terms it simply means fewer Tecles in the US.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s war on refugees is no secret. He paused the refugee resettlement program a week after taking office and repeatedly tells lies that refugees have been tied to terrorist attacks, even though none of the more than 3 million refugees resettled since 1980 have committed a lethal terrorist attack.</p> <p>The White House adviser Stephen Miller reportedly said he <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-28/book-says-trump-adviser-spoke-dismissively-about-refugees\">wanted to end all refugee resettlement in the US</a> and has <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-stephen-miller-single-handedly-got-the-us-to-accept-fewer-refugees\">suppressed government studies</a> that show the economic benefits of refugee resettlement.</p> <p>The executive branch wields immense power in determining each year how many refugees will be resettled in the US during the fiscal year, which begins in October and ends in September of the following year.</p> <p>The current ceiling is 30,000 people \u2013 which is equivalent to 0.009% of the US population and is the lowest ceiling since the modern program began.</p> <p>Bob Carey, who led the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) under Barack Obama, warned that what is happening to the program under Trump is dramatically different from what happened under the past six administrations, Republican and Democrat.</p> <p>\u201cIt is ideologically driven by some people in this administration who are against immigration in any way, shape or form,\u201d Carey said.</p> <p>No person immigrating to the US faces more scrutiny than a refugee. Trump\u2019s own national security agencies have ruled that the system for deciding who is let in has been made as secure as it can be.</p> <p>People close to the program said the opposition to refugee resettlement in the federal government originates from a small group of people. And the many who do support the program have been marginalized, ignored or left their jobs. \u201cYou have seen pushback from some quarters, otherwise there would be no program,\u201d Carey said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2019-05-28T21:00:04/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Refugee resettlement in the US from 1975 to 2018\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2019-05-28T21:00:04/embed.html\">Refugee resettlement in the US from 1975 to 2018</a> </figure>  <h2><strong>Hidden family separation</strong></h2> <p>When the US decides to allow fewer refugees in, it is also deciding to keep more families separated because a prime role of resettlement is reuniting families separated by war and other circumstances.</p> <p>Deborah Baliraine Jane resettled in Ohio in January 2016, but the journey that led her there from Uganda still dominates her day-to-day life as she waits for her children to also be resettled.</p> <p>In 2014, her husband and other men threw acid on her, scarring her face, because of the work she had done to help female victims of domestic abuse. She fled immediately, leaving her three daughters and one son with family while she sought safety.</p> <p>The children moved to Kenya and have been approved for resettlement in the US, but it has taken years for them to complete the interviews, vaccinations and orientations needed for processing. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say today, but we\u2019re waiting,\u201d Baliraine Jane said.</p> <p>But now if her children arrive as planned, they will be absorbed in a resettlement infrastructure that has crumbled under Trump.</p> <p>Advocates warn that even if the program were to be returned to its previous rates \u2013 an average of 95,000 people each year over four decades \u2013 the programs that support them are closing down and cutting jobs and people who work there are leaving for different fields.</p> <p>\u201cEven if a new administration or this administration were to change course and decide they were going to stand by these commitments, it\u2019s not going to be reconstructed in a short period of time,\u201d Carey said.</p> <h2><strong>The domino effect of the US retreat</strong></h2> <p>One of the prevailing concerns about the US curtailing its refugee program is the negative impact it has had on resettlement across the globe.</p> <p>Until Trump took office, the US was the world leader in refugee resettlement.</p> <p>In 2017, after Trump took office, the amount of resettlement places available across the globe dropped 54% compared to 2016, according to the <a href=\"https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/protection/resettlement/5a9d507f7/resettlement-fact-sheet-2017.html\">United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR</a>).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When we don\u2019t have that moral leadership, we can\u2019t ask other countries to step into that void</p> <footer> <cite>Jen Smyers</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The US has supported resettlement for its moral value and diplomatic role. It was helpful, for instance, for the US to welcome in people fleeing communist regimes during the cold war. And accepting refugees is an act of solidarity with countries that accept much higher rates of people, such as Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, which have taken in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/30/syrian-refugee-number-passes-5m-mark-un-reveals\">5 million Syrian refugees.</a></p> <p>\u201cWhen we resettle refugees, It\u2019s not just the people who are coming, it\u2019s also the signal we\u2019re sending,\u201d said Jen Smyers, associate director of policy and advocacy for the immigration and refugee program at Church World Service, which helps resettle refugees.</p> <p>Smyers continued: \u201cWhen we don\u2019t have that moral leadership, we can\u2019t ask other countries to step into that void.\u201d</p> <p>Advocates said it is clear the US withdrawal has had knock-on effects across the globe.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2000201464/kenya-to-spend-sh1-billion-for-immediate-repatriation-of-refugees-from-dadaab?pageNo=2\">In 2016</a>, Kenya\u2019s interior cabinet secretary, Joseph Nkaissery, linked a plan to close Kenya\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jan/27/life-dadaab-three-generations-of-refugees-isolated-from-kenyan-society\">Dadaab refugee camp</a> to decisions by wealthy countries to limit refugee resettlement.</p> <p>\u201cWe will not be the first to do so; this is the standard practice worldwide,\u201d Nkaissery said. \u201cFor example in Europe, rich, prosperous and democratic countries are turning away refugees from Syria, one of the worst war zones since World War Two.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>From non-partisan to political lighting rod</strong></h2> <p>The sudden change in attitudes towards the US refugee program emerged in the run-up to the 2016 election, when the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/15/why-syrian-refugee-passport-found-at-paris-attack-scene-must-be-treated-with-caution\">were incorrectly blamed on refugees.</a></p> <p>Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, then led <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/02/donald-trump-syria-refugees-us-immigration-security-terrorism\">a procession of American politicians in demonizing refugees</a>. This tactic was used in<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/12/25/anti-refugee-sentiment-election/\"> local government election races</a> in districts that had never even resettled refugees and in states that had tiny refugee populations.</p> <p>In a presidential debate, Trump said Syrian refugees were actually a \u201cgreat Trojan horse\u201d, echoing language used by President Franklin Roosevelt and other politicians in the 1930s <a href=\"https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/the-united-states-and-the-refugee-crisis-1938-41\">to justify keeping Jewish admissions low during the Holocaust</a>.</p> <p>For all this hysteria, however, refugees and advocates said the political messaging contradicted their own experiences of American public attitudes to refugees.</p> <p>After the travel ban, the <a href=\"https://www.rescue.org/\">International Rescue Committee</a> said it saw a 100% increase in volunteers in Democratic-leaning states and a 90% increase in volunteers in Republican-leaning states. Those numbers have remained steady ever since.</p> <p>Advocates are now looking to Congress to loosen the executive branch\u2019s grip on the refugee program.</p> <p>Democratic lawmakers introduced two bills in April, <a href=\"https://neguse.house.gov/media/press-releases/reps-neguse-lofgren-and-senator-markey-introduce-legislation-welcome-refugees\">the Grace Act </a>and the <a href=\"https://www.coons.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-coons-rep-chu-lead-bicameral-push-to-repeal-muslim-ban-prevent-future-discriminatory-bans\">No Ban Act</a>.

      "bodyText": "Tecle Gebremicheal loves Idaho, and he wants people to know about how it has now become home after he fled an orphanage in Eritrea at 14. After eight years in an Ethiopian refugee camp, he resettled in Idaho in 2012, learning at an airport in Florida that instead of being sent to Texas, as originally planned, he was being moved to what was then a mysterious place. \u201cPeople were saying \u2018Tecle, you can say no, this is America, you have freedom\u2019 because everyone was shocked and nobody had heard of this secret state [Idaho],\u201d Gebremicheal said. He didn\u2019t want to cause trouble and went with the plan, setting three big goals for himself in his new home, all of which he has accomplished: returning to school, buying a home and serving the community which accepted him by working in the state house. \u201cI have come to the decision, it [Boise] is the best place for refugees,\u201d said Gebremicheal, who announced in May he is running for city council in Boise. His is just one story about the life-changing power of the US refugee resettlement program \u2013 a program which has never been in such jeopardy. Donald Trump has for two consecutive years overseen the lowest refugee admission rates since the modern resettlement system was created in 1980. Since October, the US has admitted just 14,808 refugees and is projected to have allowed in just 22,000 before the end of the fiscal year in September. In fiscal year 2018, it admitted 22,491 people. Those shrinking numbers represent more separated families and more countries able to justify lowering their own resettlement numbers. In human terms it simply means fewer Tecles in the US. Trump\u2019s war on refugees is no secret. He paused the refugee resettlement program a week after taking office and repeatedly tells lies that refugees have been tied to terrorist attacks, even though none of the more than 3 million refugees resettled since 1980 have committed a lethal terrorist attack. The White House adviser Stephen Miller reportedly said he wanted to end all refugee resettlement in the US and has suppressed government studies that show the economic benefits of refugee resettlement. The executive branch wields immense power in determining each year how many refugees will be resettled in the US during the fiscal year, which begins in October and ends in September of the following year. The current ceiling is 30,000 people \u2013 which is equivalent to 0.009% of the US population and is the lowest ceiling since the modern program began. Bob Carey, who led the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) under Barack Obama, warned that what is happening to the program under Trump is dramatically different from what happened under the past six administrations, Republican and Democrat. \u201cIt is ideologically driven by some people in this administration who are against immigration in any way, shape or form,\u201d Carey said. No person immigrating to the US faces more scrutiny than a refugee. Trump\u2019s own national security agencies have ruled that the system for deciding who is let in has been made as secure as it can be. People close to the program said the opposition to refugee resettlement in the federal government originates from a small group of people. And the many who do support the program have been marginalized, ignored or left their jobs. \u201cYou have seen pushback from some quarters, otherwise there would be no program,\u201d Carey said. Hidden family separation When the US decides to allow fewer refugees in, it is also deciding to keep more families separated because a prime role of resettlement is reuniting families separated by war and other circumstances. Deborah Baliraine Jane resettled in Ohio in January 2016, but the journey that led her there from Uganda still dominates her day-to-day life as she waits for her children to also be resettled. In 2014, her husband and other men threw acid on her, scarring her face, because of the work she had done to help female victims of domestic abuse. She fled immediately, leaving her three daughters and one son with family while she sought safety. The children moved to Kenya and have been approved for resettlement in the US, but it has taken years for them to complete the interviews, vaccinations and orientations needed for processing. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say today, but we\u2019re waiting,\u201d Baliraine Jane said. But now if her children arrive as planned, they will be absorbed in a resettlement infrastructure that has crumbled under Trump. Advocates warn that even if the program were to be returned to its previous rates \u2013 an average of 95,000 people each year over four decades \u2013 the programs that support them are closing down and cutting jobs and people who work there are leaving for different fields. \u201cEven if a new administration or this administration were to change course and decide they were going to stand by these commitments, it\u2019s not going to be reconstructed in a short period of time,\u201d Carey said. The domino effect of the US retreat One of the prevailing concerns about the US curtailing its refugee program is the negative impact it has had on resettlement across the globe. Until Trump took office, the US was the world leader in refugee resettlement. In 2017, after Trump took office, the amount of resettlement places available across the globe dropped 54% compared to 2016, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR). The US has supported resettlement for its moral value and diplomatic role. It was helpful, for instance, for the US to welcome in people fleeing communist regimes during the cold war. And accepting refugees is an act of solidarity with countries that accept much higher rates of people, such as Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, which have taken in 5 million Syrian refugees. \u201cWhen we resettle refugees, It\u2019s not just the people who are coming, it\u2019s also the signal we\u2019re sending,\u201d said Jen Smyers, associate director of policy and advocacy for the immigration and refugee program at Church World Service, which helps resettle refugees. Smyers continued: \u201cWhen we don\u2019t have that moral leadership, we can\u2019t ask other countries to step into that void.\u201d Advocates said it is clear the US withdrawal has had knock-on effects across the globe. In 2016, Kenya\u2019s interior cabinet secretary, Joseph Nkaissery, linked a plan to close Kenya\u2019s Dadaab refugee camp to decisions by wealthy countries to limit refugee resettlement. \u201cWe will not be the first to do so; this is the standard practice worldwide,\u201d Nkaissery said. \u201cFor example in Europe, rich, prosperous and democratic countries are turning away refugees from Syria, one of the worst war zones since World War Two.\u201d From non-partisan to political lighting rod The sudden change in attitudes towards the US refugee program emerged in the run-up to the 2016 election, when the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris were incorrectly blamed on refugees. Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, then led a procession of American politicians in demonizing refugees. This tactic was used in local government election races in districts that had never even resettled refugees and in states that had tiny refugee populations. In a presidential debate, Trump said Syrian refugees were actually a \u201cgreat Trojan horse\u201d, echoing language used by President Franklin Roosevelt and other politicians in the 1930s to justify keeping Jewish admissions low during the Holocaust. For all this hysteria, however, refugees and advocates said the political messaging contradicted their own experiences of American public attitudes to refugees. After the travel ban, the International Rescue Committee said it saw a 100% increase in volunteers in Democratic-leaning states and a 90% increase in volunteers in Republican-leaning states. Those numbers have remained steady ever since. Advocates are now looking to Congress to loosen the executive branch\u2019s grip on the refugee program. Democratic lawmakers introduced two bills in April, the Grace Act and the No Ban Act. The former would set an annual admissions floor of 95,000 refugees and the latter would repeal the existing Muslim ban and prohibit the creation of similar, broad laws by the executive branch in the future. They are hoping to seize on the support for refugees in local communities. Dauda Sesay, who moved to the US in 2009, said he has experienced an overwhelmingly positive reception in Louisiana, even in the current political climate. It was an American soldier who rescued Sesay from Sierra Leone when he was 16. He was nearly mistaken for dead after he was attacked by political opponents of his father, a local leader in their village. The men killed his father and burned down Sesay\u2019s childhood home while his mother and other relatives were inside. Sesay said in normal American life, people are looking towards their future as 16-years-old. \u201cUnfortunately for me that\u2019s not what happened \u2013 it\u2019s when my whole life turned 180 degrees,\u201d he said. He recovered in a military hospital, met his wife, and spent nine years in a refugee camp in the Gambia, before coming to the US. \u201cI say thank you to this nation for giving me and my family a second chance at life,\u201d Sesay said. The most racist incident he experienced involved a university professor. Because of the professor\u2019s cruel remarks, Sesay would show up to class as late as possible to avoid the professor while still getting credit for attendance. He said it was painful, but he was awed by how his fellow students came to his defense, calling in the university dean to observe class because of the racism they had witnessed. \u201cSeeing that my fellow students advocated on my behalf, makes me appreciate this nation,\u201d Sesay said. \u201cThere are only a few, very few people that represent things like that. They don\u2019t represent the majority of this nation.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Antoinette Catholdi-Dow, a 30-year-old mother of two, first started noticing little bite marks on the window sills in 2015, when her son was about two and a half years old.</p> <p>The window sills were the perfect height to help her toddler pull himself up to stand and walk. Eventually, Catholdi-Dow would enter the room and catch her son nibbling along their edges.</p> <p>By this point, her son had already been diagnosed with both autism and pica, which is an eating disorder that causes a person to crave and eat non-food items. </p> <p>After a few months of this behavior, her mother-in-law suggested a call to the pediatrician\u2019s office to check his blood for lead, just to be safe. Catholdi-Dow, of Attleboro, Massachusetts, initially dismissed her concerns, but began doing research on the internet about how lead, a neurotoxin, can cause behavioral and developmental problems even at low levels. She also read that old homes, like the one where they lived, could have lead-based paint that poses a hazard to young children when it starts to deteriorate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2019/07/toxics-finished/v3/index.html\" data-alt=\"Toxic America\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2019/07/toxics-finished/v3/index.html\">Toxic America</a> </figure>  <p>But when she called her pediatrician\u2019s office with her concerns, she was at first gently rebuffed. </p> <p>\u201cThey were worried that insurance wouldn\u2019t cover it until his three-year [appointment],\u201d Catholdi-Dow said. \u201cBut because I had a reason to believe that it could possibly be lead poisoned at the time, they ended up going ahead and doing it for me.\u201d</p> <p>When Catholdi-Dow\u2019s son had his first blood lead test, the results came back at 24 micrograms per one-tenth litre of blood \u2013 almost five times higher than the reference point the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) uses to recommend a lead intervention.</p> <p>More comprehensive tests to confirm lead exposure found that her son\u2019s lead levels had actually reached 49 micrograms per one-tenth liter of blood (49 \u00b5g/dL) \u2013 almost 10 times higher than the CDC\u2019s intervention threshold. He was immediately hospitalized at Boston children\u2019s hospital.</p> <p>In the meantime, a lead abatement team also visited their home, which had been in her husband\u2019s family for three generations. They found lead hotspots on the door frames, window sills, and in her son\u2019s bedroom closet.</p> <p>\u201cMy husband\u2019s family had grown up in the house, so I didn\u2019t even think twice about it being safe or not safe,\u201d Catholdi-Dow said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f904a863313dca22c213661dc21749cd112f5834\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f904a863313dca22c213661dc21749cd112f5834/0_300_2971_1783/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Antoinette Catholdi-Dow\u2019s children play.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Antoinette Catholdi-Dow\u2019s children play.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antoinette Catholdi-Dow</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Generations</h2> <p>Catholdi-Dow, like many other Americans, likely assumed that lead was a hazard that endangered only previous generations. After all, the federal government had begun reducing lead in gasoline in 1972 and banned its use in paint for homes in 1978.</p> <p>Making things more confusing is that the history of the rise of lead in American manufacturing, as well as its eventual phase out, is often framed as a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6019a5.htm\">public health victory</a> already won.</p> <p>But this national narrative obscures a horrifying truth about lead, which is that sudden mass exposure can happen anywhere, anytime \u2013 as it did in Flint, Michigan when improperly treated water began corroding lead pipes and releasing harmful chemicals into the tap water in 2014. And due to a complex mix of factors including the various competing pressures on physicians and weak regulations about how to report this data, there is no federal system that can quickly identify lead exposure emergencies as they happen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"03e6489212922acbc23b3aa387c746f344419c96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03e6489212922acbc23b3aa387c746f344419c96/2196_99_1728_2160/800.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Mona Hanna-Attisha.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Mona Hanna-Attisha.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Doug Pike/Hurley Medical Center</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When it comes to lead exposure in America, we still don\u2019t have a clear picture of how many children are being exposed to the neurotoxin and where they are.

People have used lead to make cosmetics, <a href=\"https://archive.epa.gov/epa/aboutepa/lead-poisoning-historical-perspective.html\">drinking and eating vessels, aqueducts</a> and more since the days of Ancient Rome (the word \u201cplumbing\u201d comes from the <a href=\"https://www.dictionary.com/browse/plumbing\">Latin word for lead, </a><em><a href=\"https://www.dictionary.com/browse/plumbing\">plumbum</a></em>).</p> <p>People from the ancient world also knew that coming into direct contact with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/04/opinion/l-ancient-romans-were-wary-of-lead-139589.html\">large amounts of lead was harmful</a>, and linked to forgetfulness, melancholy and insanity. But this didn\u2019t stop manufacturers in America and other countries from using lead compounds in pipes, paint, food cans and gasoline at the turn of the 20th century.</p> <p>All of these industrial uses put lead particles in the air, in homes and in food and water. In Europe, France, Belgium and Austria were among the first countries to ban it in interior paints in 1909.</p> <p>By 1924, independent American scientists understood that <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2013/01/looney-gas-and-lead-poisoning-a-short-sad-history/\">lead in gasoline posed a lethal hazard</a> to the workers making gas, as well as a more subtle but chronic danger for people breathing in car exhaust and factory emissions.</p> <p>But it wasn\u2019t until the early 1970s that Congress overcame intense industry opposition and began slowly banning the use of lead-based paint in federal housing, removing lead from gasoline and setting limits on the element in drinking water. It was a long process; lead wasn\u2019t <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6320665/\">completely banned from gasoline</a> until 1996.</p> <p>The US is still grappling with how to remove lingering lead from the environment. Last Friday, the Environmental Protection Agency finalized new regulations that would <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/lead/hazard-standards-lead-paint-dust-and-soil-tsca-section-403\">drastically cut the levels of acceptable lead</a> in dust in public housing, hospitals and schools built before 1978.</p> <p>By 1976, the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6213a3.htm\">blood lead level of the average American child</a> between one to five years old was estimated at 15 micrograms per one-tenth litre of blood , or what is now three times the CDC\u2019s current intervention threshold.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1XuiNh_zbUI_AN5-2zClVY3loieDS-g2NdPGExcmVGqM\" data-alt=\"The impact of lead\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/tools/tables/embed/index.html?spreadsheet=1XuiNh_zbUI_AN5-2zClVY3loieDS-g2NdPGExcmVGqM\">The impact of lead</a> </figure>  <p>Scientists would eventually discover that lead exposure during childhood can destroy brain cells, disrupt communication between neurons and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2689675/\">shrink the prefrontal cortex</a>, which is the part of the brain that helps with complex decision making, emotion and aggression regulation and impulse control.</p> <p>Nationally, chronic lead exposure in the US has been linked to everything from a <a href=\"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1240871\">significant loss of IQ points</a> to a <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/02/lead-exposure-gasoline-crime-increase-children-health/\">rise in violent crime</a> to billions of dollars <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2717145/\">lost in future earnings</a> and tax revenue. There is no \u201csafe\u201d level of lead, and its effects are irreversible. The only treatment that doctors have at their disposal, chelation, is not used except in extreme poisoning cases.</p> <p>Young American children nowadays have an average blood lead level of about one microgram per one-tenth liter of blood (1 \u00b5g/dL). We know this because every year, a small but representative sample of about 5,000 Americans are picked randomly to answer surveys and undergo physical exams that will give health officials an overall picture of the nation\u2019s health \u2013 including how much lead is in people\u2019s blood. This sample is known as the <a href=\"https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overview.aspx?BeginYear=2015\">CDC\u2019s National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey</a> (NHANES).</p> <p>But this national average tells a deceptive story about the risks that environmental lead still pose to children.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/06/blood_lead-zip/giv-3902sn7i0ICZEM0P/\" data-alt=\"States which reported children's levels of lead in their blood.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/06/blood_lead-zip/giv-3902sn7i0ICZEM0P/\">States which reported children's levels of lead in their blood.</a> </figure>  <p>The CDC estimates that there are more than half a million children in the US like Catholdi-Dow\u2019s son who have blood lead levels at or above the CDC\u2019s reference value for intervention.

      "bodyText": "Antoinette Catholdi-Dow, a 30-year-old mother of two, first started noticing little bite marks on the window sills in 2015, when her son was about two and a half years old. The window sills were the perfect height to help her toddler pull himself up to stand and walk. Eventually, Catholdi-Dow would enter the room and catch her son nibbling along their edges. By this point, her son had already been diagnosed with both autism and pica, which is an eating disorder that causes a person to crave and eat non-food items. After a few months of this behavior, her mother-in-law suggested a call to the pediatrician\u2019s office to check his blood for lead, just to be safe. Catholdi-Dow, of Attleboro, Massachusetts, initially dismissed her concerns, but began doing research on the internet about how lead, a neurotoxin, can cause behavioral and developmental problems even at low levels. She also read that old homes, like the one where they lived, could have lead-based paint that poses a hazard to young children when it starts to deteriorate. But when she called her pediatrician\u2019s office with her concerns, she was at first gently rebuffed. \u201cThey were worried that insurance wouldn\u2019t cover it until his three-year [appointment],\u201d Catholdi-Dow said. \u201cBut because I had a reason to believe that it could possibly be lead poisoned at the time, they ended up going ahead and doing it for me.\u201d When Catholdi-Dow\u2019s son had his first blood lead test, the results came back at 24 micrograms per one-tenth litre of blood \u2013 almost five times higher than the reference point the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) uses to recommend a lead intervention. More comprehensive tests to confirm lead exposure found that her son\u2019s lead levels had actually reached 49 micrograms per one-tenth liter of blood (49 \u00b5g/dL) \u2013 almost 10 times higher than the CDC\u2019s intervention threshold. He was immediately hospitalized at Boston children\u2019s hospital. In the meantime, a lead abatement team also visited their home, which had been in her husband\u2019s family for three generations. They found lead hotspots on the door frames, window sills, and in her son\u2019s bedroom closet. \u201cMy husband\u2019s family had grown up in the house, so I didn\u2019t even think twice about it being safe or not safe,\u201d Catholdi-Dow said. Generations Catholdi-Dow, like many other Americans, likely assumed that lead was a hazard that endangered only previous generations. After all, the federal government had begun reducing lead in gasoline in 1972 and banned its use in paint for homes in 1978. Making things more confusing is that the history of the rise of lead in American manufacturing, as well as its eventual phase out, is often framed as a public health victory already won. But this national narrative obscures a horrifying truth about lead, which is that sudden mass exposure can happen anywhere, anytime \u2013 as it did in Flint, Michigan when improperly treated water began corroding lead pipes and releasing harmful chemicals into the tap water in 2014. And due to a complex mix of factors including the various competing pressures on physicians and weak regulations about how to report this data, there is no federal system that can quickly identify lead exposure emergencies as they happen. When it comes to lead exposure in America, we still don\u2019t have a clear picture of how many children are being exposed to the neurotoxin and where they are. This leaves hundreds of thousands of children vulnerable to the dangers of lead, and compounds inequality in the form of cognitive and behavioral deficits that can hamper communities for generations. Experts say that it\u2019s possible to eradicate lead from American infrastructure, but that we don\u2019t prioritize it. \u201cWe are currently doing things backwards [by] using children\u2019s blood as detectors of environmental contamination,\u201d said Dr Mona Hanna-Attisha, the pediatrician who famously uncovered elevated levels of lead in her pediatric patients and linked it to a new water source in Flint, Michigan. \u201cThe screening that needs to happen is in the environment before children are ever exposed.\u201d Why lead is so dangerous Lead is a naturally occuring heavy metal valued for both its affordability and malleability. People have used lead to make cosmetics, drinking and eating vessels, aqueducts and more since the days of Ancient Rome (the word \u201cplumbing\u201d comes from the Latin word for lead, plumbum). People from the ancient world also knew that coming into direct contact with large amounts of lead was harmful, and linked to forgetfulness, melancholy and insanity. But this didn\u2019t stop manufacturers in America and other countries from using lead compounds in pipes, paint, food cans and gasoline at the turn of the 20th century. All of these industrial uses put lead particles in the air, in homes and in food and water. In Europe, France, Belgium and Austria were among the first countries to ban it in interior paints in 1909. By 1924, independent American scientists understood that lead in gasoline posed a lethal hazard to the workers making gas, as well as a more subtle but chronic danger for people breathing in car exhaust and factory emissions. But it wasn\u2019t until the early 1970s that Congress overcame intense industry opposition and began slowly banning the use of lead-based paint in federal housing, removing lead from gasoline and setting limits on the element in drinking water. It was a long process; lead wasn\u2019t completely banned from gasoline until 1996. The US is still grappling with how to remove lingering lead from the environment. Last Friday, the Environmental Protection Agency finalized new regulations that would drastically cut the levels of acceptable lead in dust in public housing, hospitals and schools built before 1978. By 1976, the blood lead level of the average American child between one to five years old was estimated at 15 micrograms per one-tenth litre of blood , or what is now three times the CDC\u2019s current intervention threshold. Scientists would eventually discover that lead exposure during childhood can destroy brain cells, disrupt communication between neurons and shrink the prefrontal cortex, which is the part of the brain that helps with complex decision making, emotion and aggression regulation and impulse control. Nationally, chronic lead exposure in the US has been linked to everything from a significant loss of IQ points to a rise in violent crime to billions of dollars lost in future earnings and tax revenue. There is no \u201csafe\u201d level of lead, and its effects are irreversible. The only treatment that doctors have at their disposal, chelation, is not used except in extreme poisoning cases. Young American children nowadays have an average blood lead level of about one microgram per one-tenth liter of blood (1 \u00b5g/dL). We know this because every year, a small but representative sample of about 5,000 Americans are picked randomly to answer surveys and undergo physical exams that will give health officials an overall picture of the nation\u2019s health \u2013 including how much lead is in people\u2019s blood. This sample is known as the CDC\u2019s National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). But this national average tells a deceptive story about the risks that environmental lead still pose to children. The CDC estimates that there are more than half a million children in the US like Catholdi-Dow\u2019s son who have blood lead levels at or above the CDC\u2019s reference value for intervention. They are concentrated mostly in low-income communities throughout the country because they are the ones who are most likely to live in substandard housing. An estimated 23m housing units in the US have at least one lead-based paint hazard \u2013 3.6m of which are homes for children under six years old. Making matters even worse is that the US does not have a robust surveillance system that can find these at-risk children and track potential emergencies like the 2014 one in Flint, Michigan, said Eric Roberts, a research scientist specializing in lead exposure at Public Health Institute, a not-for-profit health research organization. Indeed, the Flint, Michigan lead exposure crisis was uncovered by concerned citizens, local pediatricians like Hanna-Attisha and independent scientists. This is because not all states require pediatricians to measure blood lead levels in children or report them to county or state health departments. These results, in turn, may or may not get reported to the CDC. That means that the CDC\u2019s most up-to-date local data can\u2019t be used to identify short-term trends or make generalizations about childhood lead exposure at the local, state or national level. It took a 2016 Reuters investigation to identify and map out more than 3,800 neighborhoods throughout the US with lead exposure rates double those found in Flint, Michigan, after their water became contaminated. Reuters\u2019 maps are based on local public health data that had not been published. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services require all children enrolled in Medicaid be tested for lead at ages one and two years old. But this kind of universal screening has never been achieved. In fact, Roberts estimates that less than 20% of all young children are tested for lead, no matter what kind of insurance they have, and this screening only identifies about 60% of children with elevated blood lead levels in the US. This estimate, which is the only comprehensive analysis on the subject, is based on numbers from the previous decade. \u201cI know that in the public health establishment we\u2019re very pious about our belief that lead exposure is bad and protecting kids is good,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see us making an honest effort to make sure that all the kids are lead free.\u201d What would it cost to rid the US of lead hazards permanently? If the US is serious about bringing down blood lead levels, officials need to both strengthen blood testing regulations and set their sights on remediating lead in homes, water infrastructure and soil, public health officials and advocates say. \u201cWe\u2019ll never medically test our way out of this,\u201d said David Jacobs, chief scientist at the National Center for Healthy Housing and a former director in charge of lead hazard control at the US Department of Housing and Urban Development. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to test the houses, not only the children who have already been exposed.\u201d The CDC also agrees that getting rid of lead in the environment is the best way to prevent lead exposure. \u201cPrimary prevention \u2013 the removal of lead hazards from the environment before a child is exposed \u2013 is the most effective way to ensure that children do not experience harmful long-term effects of lead exposure,\u201d said Dr Adrienne Ettinger, chief of the CDC Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program. The issue is cost \u2013 about $400bn over a 10-year period, according to a calculation by Vox\u2019s Matt Yglesias. But the investment is worth it. Removing leaded drinking water lines, remediating lead paint hazards, eliminating lead from plane fuel and other eradication efforts to protect just the children born in 2018 alone could result in as much as $84bn in future benefits, according to a 2017 analysis from the Pew Charitable Trusts. This money would be in the form of increased revenue and savings to the healthcare, education and criminal justice systems. While the report didn\u2019t put a figure on the total cost of these repairs, it estimated that it would cost $2bn to replace lead service lines and $18.7bn to deal with lead paint hazards in homes for the 2018 babies. The federal government is the obvious main funder for this kind of initiative, but Jacobs says that the money should also come from private sources \u2013 specifically, the paint and gasoline companies that put all the lead in the environment in the first place. \u201cCompanies who caused this problem have to be part of the solution,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cEveryone else has paid for it except them.\u201d Lawsuits This concept has antecedents in settlements like the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, which set up a perpetual pot of money funded by America\u2019s largest cigarette companies to help states pay for tobacco-related healthcare. California is the first state to pursue and win this kind of judgment against former lead paint manufacturers. In 2017, the California court of appeals upheld the Santa Clara county superior court decision to hold Sherwin-Williams Company, NL Industries, Inc, and ConAgra Grocery Products responsible for finding and remediating homes with lead paint hazards built before 1951. The US supreme court declined to hear the paint manufacturers\u2019 appeal, and the lead abatement fund is now set at $409m, according to the county of Santa Clara. While this may seem like a lot of money, it\u2019s nothing compared to what paint companies might have to pay if more jurisdictions begin allowing people with documented lead poisoning to pursue these lawsuits individually. In May, a federal jury awarded three Milwaukee men $2m each for lead paint poisoning they suffered as toddlers, to be paid by the paint companies Sherwin-Williams, Armstrong Container Corp and DuPont. The verdict is the first of its kind, and the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that he hopes that the decision \u201cis just the beginning\u201d of a wave of lawsuits. In Cleveland, Ohio, city officials are under renewed pressure to reduce high levels of lead exposure in homes, particularly in its almost 50,000 one- or two-unit rental homes, where a majority of children who are poisoned live, because of grassroots advocacy on the issue. Educating landlords, contractors, parents After Catholdi-Dow\u2019s son was hospitalized, he endured six months of chelation therapy, which involved swallowing a medicine that both tastes and smells like rotten eggs twice a day. He is now six years old, and his blood lead levels have decreased significantly. When he entered elementary school, Catholdi-Dow struggled with whether or not to disclose his former diagnosis and current blood lead level, which is now at 12 microgram per one-tenth liter of blood (\u00b5g/dL). \u201cI was very nervous to share it with his teachers because I didn\u2019t want him to be written off as someone who had brain damage and wouldn\u2019t be able to learn,\u201d she said. Catholdi-Dow knows that the effects of acute lead exposure will become more obvious as he gets older, when school becomes more demanding. Currently, her son is mostly non-verbal unless he\u2019s repeating songs or TV shows that he likes. And while it\u2019s difficult to disentangle the effects of lead poisoning from his autism diagnosis, she and his doctors feel that his hyperactivity may be one consequence of the exposure. Thankfully, Catholdi-Dow has nothing but praise for the teachers at her son\u2019s school. His special education class maintains a one-to-one ratio of teachers to students, and she says that his teachers see his potential and teach to his strengths. Another thing she\u2019s thankful for: her youngest child, a daughter one year younger than her son, has no detectable lead in her blood. \u201cWe\u2019re very lucky that it wasn\u2019t a dust situation, and [the lead exposure] was more from him biting.\u201d Because of everything she and her family have experienced, Catholdi-Dow decided to join the Childhood Lead Action Project, a Rhode Island organization dedicated to eliminating lead exposure in children. She helps educate landlords, contractors and parents about the potential hazards of both lead paint and lead paint removal. If not done correctly, power sanding, open flame burning and other paint removal techniques can actually produce lead dust, making the problem even worse. Catholdi-Dow thinks one thing that could prevent lead exposure in future children would be to make lead testing and education a standard part of prenatal care and preparation for a new baby. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re buying a home, definitely get it checked for lead before purchasing it, especially if it\u2019s a home built before 1978,\u201d she said.",

He is seen by many <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/why-do-black-voters-support-biden-they-just-want-to-beat-trump/2019/05/31/74b37ca8-7b33-11e9-8ede-f4abf521ef17_story.html?utm_term=.eed9cbe71d0d\">as the pragmatic and safe choice</a> in a year when nothing can be left to chance against Donald Trump, viewed by many as racist, xenophobic and winking at white supremacists.</p> \n<p>But there is still plenty of time for others, including the two African American candidates, to make inroads. Booker, 50, from New Jersey, has made gun violence and criminal justice reform central pillars of his campaign.<a href=\"https://apnews.com/9c207eeef452411489d82c87c62177e5\"> Harris, 54, from California,</a> who gets the chance to go toe to toe with Biden on Thursday, emphasises a personal biography that includes parents active in the civil rights movement and student days at the historically black Howard University in Washington.</p> \n<p>Clinton had a clear lead over Obama among black voters in late 2007 but, when he won the first caucuses, in Iowa, and made clear he had a genuine chance, the tide turned in his favour. Some believe the same could happen for Booker or Harris.</p> \n<p>House of Representatives majority whip <a href=\"https://clyburn.house.gov/\">Jim Clyburn,</a> whose annual fish fry in South Carolina drew 21 candidates last Friday night, told the Guardian: \u201cIn spite of what may be said to the contrary, Barack Obama won the South Carolina primary real big on the night he won the Iowa caucuses.

The performance levels that were reached by those two in Iowa will determine their fortunes in South Carolina.\u201d</p> \n<p>Harris supporter Paul Fletcher, a teacher who put a question to candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke at Tuesday\u2019s union meeting in North Miami, recalled that black leaders in the Democratic party had initially be sceptical of Obama.</p> \n<p>\u201cAll the same people were telling young people it wasn\u2019t Obama\u2019s time and he had to wait.

Restoring the black vote to Obama-era levels could be enough to turn those states Democratic again.</p> \n<p>But a question haunting the the party this time is whether, after producing the first African American president in 2008 and a uniquely diverse line-up this time \u2013 including six women, six people of colour and an openly gay man \u2013 it is going to go back to the future by nominating a straight white septuagenarian male.</p> \n<h2>\u2018A little out of touch\u2019</h2> \n<p>Biden, notoriously gaffe prone, got into trouble last week when he boasted about working with avowed segregationists in the Senate in the name of civility and getting things done.

A lot of people want someone to stand up and say they understand what that experience is.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some candidates will be under particular scrutiny at the debates. Pete Buttigieg, 37, is dealing with the aftermath of the fatal police shooting of a black man in South Bend, Indiana, where he serves as mayor; his poll ratings <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/pete-buttigieg-has-a-black-problem-top-african-american-leaders-say-he-is-naive-on-race\">among African Americans have been dismal.</a> After his pummelling in 2016, Sanders has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/07/bernie-sanders-2020-presidential-run-black-voters\">working to engage African American voters</a> this time around.</p> \n<p>But many African Americans will be watching the this week\u2019s debates to see if the candidates follow through. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MsLaToshaBrown?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">LaTosha Brown</a>, co-founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund, said: \u201cAs black voters, it\u2019s one thing when candidates come to a black church or South Carolina or entertainments specifically tailored for black people, but on these large stages are they going to be able to speak to these issues in our communities?

Asked why Booker and Harris are not polling higher among African Americans, she replied: \u201cRacism is so pervasive in this country, there\u2019s no area it doesn\u2019t impact, including the media. I\u2019m not surprised the black candidates are not polling higher than the others.</p> \n<p>\u201cA lot of the headlines for weeks were Biden, Bernie, even Buttigieg. How did Beto get up there?! There\u2019s white male bias in the coverage that plays out in the idea of who\u2019s electable and who\u2019s not electable. There is structural racism and the media has been obsessed with white male leadership. We\u2019ve had 45 presidents and only one of them was not a white male.\u201d</p> \n<p>No one \u2013 black or white \u2013 can take black voters for granted, Brown continued. \u201cI think we\u2019re one of the most sophisticated constituencies. We will vote for white folks much quicker than white folks will vote for us. We\u2019ve done it hundreds of thousands of time. Yes, black folks are looking for a black candidate who will reflect their needs and issues, but we have the receipts to show that is not the sole determinant of our vote.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are less attached to white male leadership than our white counterparts are.

Some candidates, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/19/elizabeth-warren-black-voters-1282642\">appear to be gaining traction,</a> particularly among young African Americans, with proposals including cancelling student debt and strengthening voting rights.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.acrecampaigns.org/staff\">Maurice BP-Weeks,</a> co-executive director of Action Center on Race and the Economy, said: \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s campaign is based on proximity to Obama \u2013 perhaps the most popular politician in history and of course wildly popular among black voters.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think one of the reasons he\u2019ll fall is one of the same reasons Harris and Booker have not performed as well yet \u2013 people want real substantive and structural change.

      "bodyText": "Dionne Whitby, a black teacher, was waiting in a school gym, an air conditioned refuge from the Florida heat, for a union meeting on the eve of the first Democratic presidential primary debate. She admires Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, she said, but will probably vote for Joe Biden. \u201cI love both of them but I don\u2019t think they\u2019d be able to beat Trump because of popularity, race, gender \u2013 some of the reasons that Hillary didn\u2019t win,\u201d Whitby, 36, said in North Miami, a majority African American city. \u201cI think Biden should take one of them as his vice-president.\u201d The comment illustrated the difficult calculus for a critical voting bloc when the most diverse field of presidential candidates in history takes the stage here on Wednesday and Thursday nights. Opinion polls suggest the competition for African American voters will be far more intense than in 2008, when Barack Obama dominated against Hillary Clinton, or in 2016, when Clinton trounced Bernie Sanders. Biden, 76, who long championed civil rights and was himself vice-president under Obama, remains the current favourite among black voters, apparently drawing particular supporters from older voters who backed Bill and Hillary Clinton and Obama. He is seen by many as the pragmatic and safe choice in a year when nothing can be left to chance against Donald Trump, viewed by many as racist, xenophobic and winking at white supremacists. But there is still plenty of time for others, including the two African American candidates, to make inroads. Booker, 50, from New Jersey, has made gun violence and criminal justice reform central pillars of his campaign. Harris, 54, from California, who gets the chance to go toe to toe with Biden on Thursday, emphasises a personal biography that includes parents active in the civil rights movement and student days at the historically black Howard University in Washington. Clinton had a clear lead over Obama among black voters in late 2007 but, when he won the first caucuses, in Iowa, and made clear he had a genuine chance, the tide turned in his favour. Some believe the same could happen for Booker or Harris. House of Representatives majority whip Jim Clyburn, whose annual fish fry in South Carolina drew 21 candidates last Friday night, told the Guardian: \u201cIn spite of what may be said to the contrary, Barack Obama won the South Carolina primary real big on the night he won the Iowa caucuses. He demonstrated in Iowa that he had viability and I think that the same could take place here. The performance levels that were reached by those two in Iowa will determine their fortunes in South Carolina.\u201d Harris supporter Paul Fletcher, a teacher who put a question to candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke at Tuesday\u2019s union meeting in North Miami, recalled that black leaders in the Democratic party had initially be sceptical of Obama. \u201cAll the same people were telling young people it wasn\u2019t Obama\u2019s time and he had to wait. Hillary Clinton had all the super delegates and all the money but he had a new idea about how to raise money through the internet. A lot of black politicians had to come back and apologise. They miscalculated just like they continue to do.\u201d He added: \u201cBiden appeals to the Obama and Clinton constituencies. They aren\u2019t the most progressive. They\u2019re still trying to figure out how they lost the last one and, if they continue as they are, they might find a similar outcome.\u201d Fletcher, 72, from Hollywood in Florida, backed Sanders last time and described the political establishment as out of touch. \u201cThey used to talk about hip-hop music bringing down the community. Now they all want money from Jay-Z and Beyonce.\u201d Black voters are expected to make up 20% of the Democratic party electorate nationally. Party officials have stressed the importance of their vote in next year\u2019s election after black turnout dipped in 2016 when Clinton was the nominee, a crucial factor in her defeat by Trump in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

In a bid to reduce waiting times to 50 days, the new NDIS minister, Stuart Robert, announced on Wednesday the government would offer interim plans for children aged six and under who were expected to face long delays to get onto the scheme. The average waiting time for an NDIS plan to be finalised is more than 100 days, but Robert pledged the new policy would give those expected to wait longer than 50 days a $10,000 \u201cstandardised interim plan\u201d while their full package was being worked out. \u201cI have been working with the NDIA to identify what more can be done to reduce the backlogs that are currently being experienced by families in some locations,\u201d he said. The scheme \u2013 which now covers 280,000 participants, including 11,500 aged 0-6 who access the NDIS Early Childhood Early Intervention program \u2013 has been plagued by delays. Some parents have complained about waiting nearly 12 months for access to a finalised plan, while MPs have said their offices have received reports of parents waiting more than six months for their first planning meeting. Romola Hollywood, the director of policy and advocacy at People with Disability Australia, said the organisation was pleased the government had taken \u201cthe first steps\u201d in addressing \u201cconsiderable delays for people with disability in accessing supports through the NDIS\u201d. But she warned that Wednesday\u2019s announcement should only be seen as a temporary fix. \u201cIn addition, the introduction of standard interim plans while individual plans are being implemented must be seen as only a stopgap measure, and not as a move away from the individualised supports that people with disability need,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe also need to see measures to reduce delays, such as removing the staff cap at the NDIA, and better training for staff, introduced as soon as possible.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Council for Intellectual Disability chief executive, Justine O\u2019Neill, also said the changes would \u201cgo some way to reduce the delays\u201d but were a \u201cstop-gap measure and not a solution\u201d. \u201cIt is encouraging that this announcement provides a better pathway for children with complex support needs with these children being immediately streamed to an NDIA Early Childhood specialist to develop their NDIS plan,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. Piers Gooding, an NDIS researcher at the University of Melbourne, said the changes were \u201ca good thing\u201d but would only help a small number of overall participants despite delays across the entire scheme. A spokesman for Robert said the changes announced on Wednesday would be funded through existing NDIS operational funding. The scheme recorded a $1.6bn underspend in the federal budget, which proved to be a major point of contention at the May election. The government said the changes would give children who don\u2019t currently receive state disability funding a \u201cstandard plan\u201d. It would be replaced by their full package within six months (around 180 days). Those who are currently receiving support from the states or territories would also get the $10,000 package, even if their existing plan was worth less than that. The NDIA told Senate estimates last year children aged six and under were waiting an average of 107 days to to have their plans approved.

By 1900, Johannesburg was known as a true cycling city. Writing in 1903, a newspaper columnist, wrote: \u201cThere are few cities in South Africa or in any other part of the world where a large[r] number of cyclists are to be found as in Johannesburg. Nearly every third inhabitant rides a bicycle, and it may be said of the Johannesburg child that he learns to cycle before he can walk.\u201d</p> <p>Bicycles were status symbols \u2013 fashionable consumer goods for the wealthy to tour around on and use for sport.

      "bodyText": "\u201cThe writer counted, in the space of only four minutes, 93 native cyclists riding past the Astra theatre,\u201d wrote a journalist for the Star newspaper in July 1940. Standing almost 80 years later on the same corner of Louis Botha Avenue at the same time and day of the week \u2013 6.30pm on a Monday \u2013 it is hard to imagine. The theatre is long gone and not a single cyclist is to be seen on the car-choked thoroughfare. What happened to Johannesburg\u2019s once vibrant commuter cycling culture? The dominance of the automobile marginalised the bicycle in many cities around the world through the 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s but that process was accelerated in South Africa by apartheid. When policies of spatial segregation forcibly moved black people to faraway townships at the periphery of the city, the distance between work and home increased dramatically and cycling collapsed as an everyday practice. Twenty-five years after apartheid\u2019s fall, those spatial and economic inequalities remain entrenched in the city and continue to shape how people get around. The story of Johannesburg starts in 1886 with the discovery of gold. As prospectors from around the world flooded in to seek their fortunes, what had once been farmland was transformed in the space of a few years into a thriving city. Members of Johannesburg Amateur Bicycling Club, a white leisure cycling group, in the 1890s The economic boom meant residents could afford new consumer goods that conveyed modernity \u2013 the bicycle among them. By 1900, Johannesburg was known as a true cycling city. Writing in 1903, a newspaper columnist, wrote: \u201cThere are few cities in South Africa or in any other part of the world where a large[r] number of cyclists are to be found as in Johannesburg. Nearly every third inhabitant rides a bicycle, and it may be said of the Johannesburg child that he learns to cycle before he can walk.\u201d Bicycles were status symbols \u2013 fashionable consumer goods for the wealthy to tour around on and use for sport. White cycling associations fought for cyclists\u2019 rights on the streets and the colonial authorities devised policy incentives to boost their use. The city council paid its civil servants a subsidy if they rode to work, and the central railway station planned a large cycle parking facility. Even the exclusive Rand Club installed a bike rack. Alexander Township residents ride bicycles in 1957 as part of a boycott of bus services in protest at high fares The freedom the bicycle gave black people wasn\u2019t always welcome though. Using allegations that \u201cnatives\u201d stole bicycles and rode them dangerously, the Rand Pioneers, representing the mining elite, campaigned in 1905 for a citywide law requiring black cyclists to wear a badge on their left arm to indicate they had council authorisation. It was soon retracted by the British colonial government. The arrival of the motor car changed everything. For white Johannesburgers, car ownership by black people was necessarily a social threat.

Although the city\u2019s mayor, Herman Mashaba, halted all cycle infrastructure investment in 2016, work had already begun on a new cycling and walking bridge that straddles a motorway built in the 1960s and 70s for the then mainly white motoring population. If the highway it spans epitomises Johannesburg\u2019s lost century of segregation and motorisation, then the city\u2019s future might be seen in the growing streams of walkers, joggers, cyclists and traders who make their way across the bridge every day with ease, high above the gridlock.

      "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018They are basically in fantasyland\u2019 Good morning, Warren Murray directing you to the stories that matter. Two former members of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee have made critical remarks over the Conservative leadership race and Brexit. Writing in the Guardian, Andrew Sentance said companies would want a safe pair of hands running Britain rather than the \u201cerratic\u201d Boris Johnson; while David Blanchflower said the race to be the next prime minister was \u201cincreasingly looking like a clown show, and as far as discussions of economics go, they are basically in fantasyland\u201d. The prospect of Johnson or Jeremy Hunt allowing the country to walk away without a deal on 31 October has alarmed business groups and put renewed pressure on the pound, according to analysis by the Guardian. Britain\u2019s next prime minister will take charge of an economy that is faltering because of all the uncertainty, our Brexit Watch for June shows. In the leadership race, Hunt has suggested there is \u201cno trust\u201d in Johnson to fulfil his promises on Brexit, telling the BBC he believes he has the better personality to be prime minister. After Johnson challenged him to commit to taking the UK out of the EU on 31 October \u201ccome what may\u201d, Hunt said: \u201cIf there isn\u2019t and if no deal is still on the table I\u2019ve been very clear. I will leave the European Union without a deal. But I\u2019m not going to do that if there\u2019s a prospect of a better deal and, if I did it, it would be with a heavy heart, because businesses up and down the country would face a lot of destruction.\u201d Jeremy Corbyn is still holding back on giving Labour\u2019s full-throated backing for remain, and this morning Jon Cruddas argues the issue is not so simple that the party can just \u201cstop triangulating, offer some leadership and hoover up the votes of remainers\u201d. * * * Outbreak of deadly strep \u2013 Twelve people have died in the Essex area and 20 more have been infected by invasive group A streptococcus bacteria (iGas), Public Health England has said. Those infected have been elderly people receiving treatment for wounds in care homes and their own homes, according to NHS Mid Essex. The cases are spread across the Braintree, Chelmsford city and Maldon districts. Rachel Hearn, from NHS Mid Essex, said extra infection control measures had been put in place to prevent the infection spreading in the area. \u201cThe risk of contracting iGAS is very low for the vast majority of people and treatment with antibiotics is very effective if started early,\u201d she said. * * * Midweek catch-up &gt; Trump-Russia investigator Robert Mueller will testify to Congress in July, it has been announced overnight. Iran has suggested Donald Trump has a \u201cmental disorder\u201d while Trump has threatened \u201cobliteration\u201d if Iran attacks \u201canything American\u201d. Jared Kushner\u2019s Middle East peace plan has been unveiled in Bahrain with no Israelis or Palestinians present. &gt; British employees are being shut out of decisions over the rising use of the robots that are displacing them, says a report for the Fabians and the Community trade union. A separate Oxford study says Cumbria and the West Midlands are the places in Britain most at risk from job losses due to automation. &gt; Denmark has followed the lead of Finland and Sweden to form a leftist government after the Social Democratic party leader, Mette Frederiksen, 41, pulled together a one-party minority government that makes her the youngest ever Danish PM. &gt; The chief of US border protection has resigned amid uproar at migrant children being held in filthy conditions. Photos have shown the bodies of a father and daughter who drowned trying to cross the Rio Grande (warning \u2013 graphic images). &gt; Two books about the Troubles in Northern Ireland are the winners of the Orwell prize for 2019. Milkman by Anna Burns won the inaugural prize for political fiction, while the prize for political writing went to Patrick Radden Keefe for Say Nothing. * * * \u2018Cyber-flashers\u2019 targeted \u2013 Revenge porn victims may get automatic anonymity in court if changes to online harassment laws go ahead. \u201cCyber-flashing\u201d, when people receive unsolicited sexual images on their phone, and \u201cdeepfake pornography\u201d, where someone\u2019s face is superimposed on to pornographic photos or videos, could be criminalised. \u201cThis review will build on our recent work to make upskirting and revenge porn illegal to protect victims and ensure perpetrators feel the full weight of the law,\u201d said Paul Maynard, the justice minister. Separately, unions, charities and women\u2019s rights groups are campaigning to make employers liable if they fail to protect their staff from sexual harassment at work. * * * Clean air policies slowly working \u2013 Early deaths linked to dirty air in the UK fell by half from 1970 to 2010 but toxic air remains the number one environmental health hazard, causing one in 20 deaths, researchers say. They call for urgent government action to deal with a public health emergency on a par with alcohol abuse. Targeting coal power stations has produced cleaner air, while more recent falls in small-particle and nitrogen dioxide pollution from vehicles have followed stronger EU regulations. But ammonia from farms, which mixes with city air to form dangerous particles, has yet to be stringently tackled, the scientists say, and ozone pollution has risen. * * * Allen key to the door \u2013 Ikea has been given the green light to build affordable homes in UK.

Eoin Morgan denied a suggestion he was scared when batting but admitted England\u2019s confidence has dipped following the 64-run defeat to Australia that has left their World Cup hopes in the balance. Leaked emails appear to link a member of the Qatari royal family to a deal that is being investigated as part of a inquiry into alleged corruption surrounding bids for the 2017 athletics world championships and 2020 Olympic Games. Meanwhile breakdancing has moved a step closer to the 2024 Olympics, and now organisers can look to book a street venue in Paris.

      "bodyText": "Summer of Rockets 9pm, BBC Two This cold-war drama by the heavyweight BBC auteur Stephen Poliakoff trundles to an elegant conclusion. Poor Petrukhin is ordered to infiltrate a moustachioed cabal of disaffected former men of influence convinced the Russians have penetrated the secret service. At last, he learns the truth about the Shaws. MB The Trans Women Athlete Dispute With Martina Navratilova 9pm, BBC One Earlier this year, when the tennis star Martina Navratilova said allowing transgender athletes to compete in women\u2019s sports was \u201cinsane and cheating\u201d, she prompted a great deal of controversy. This film follows Navratilova as she explores the issue in greater detail, meeting trans athletes, scientists and sporting officials to explore why the subject has become so controversial. A look at emerging issues around gender and fair participation in sport. Mike Bradley The Restaurant That Makes Mistakes 9pm, Channel 4 Lorayne was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia at just 48, and told she had between two and eight years to live. Tonight, in this admirable and moving series, we see how she copes serving at the UK\u2019s first restaurant staffed by people living with dementia. Ali Catterall Wild Bill 9pm, ITV Once you get past the decidedly odd premise \u2013 Rob Lowe as a US cop in rural Lincolnshire \u2013 this turns out to be a nicely understated, pleasingly melancholic drama. Tonight, a murderer is targeting elderly people, against a backdrop of police redundancies. But there is an equally bleak family tragedy at the heart of the riddle. Phil Harrison How to Get Away With Murder 9pm, Sky Witness Back for a fifth season, the solid Shondaland drama puts Prof Annalise Keating (Viola Davis) back in the classroom after her momentous supreme court victory. A new mystery starts to unfold as she selects students \u2013 the Keating Four among them \u2013 for her new legal clinic at Middleton.

On Wednesday protesters marched to the US and British consulates as well as the European Union\u2019s representative office. On their arrival, protesters read out their petition letters before handing them to consulate officials. \u201cIn desperation we seek your engagement and assistance to fight back against this authoritarian regime with us,\u201d a protester read from a letter addressed to Trump.

Lam has suspended the controversial bill and apologised for the social disharmony caused after earlier mass protests, but stopped short of withdrawing it and condemning the police\u2019s use of force. Hong Kong police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse hundreds of thousands occupying the main thoroughfares outside the government headquarters on 12 June, drawing condemnation from international rights groups. \u201cOur local government has ignored us so we have no choice but to seek help from the international community,\u201d said Lau. He said he hoped that foreign countries could weigh in on the extradition bill controversy at G20 to help uphold the special status of Hong Kong.

According to the commission on workers and technology, run by the Fabian Society and the Community trade union, almost six in 10 employees across Britain in a poll said their employers did not give them a say on the use of new technologies. Risking a future where workers\u2019 jobs get worse and people\u2019s voices go unheard over changes in the workplace, the findings come as a separate report finds the use of robots in poorer regions triggers the loss of almost twice as many jobs as in wealthier ones. In a study by the consultancy firm Oxford Economics, the rapidly growing use of robots is expected to have a profound impact on jobs across the world, resulting in up to 20m manufacturing job losses by 2030. Around 1.7m manufacturing jobs have already been lost to robots since 2000, according to the study, including as many as 400,000 in Europe, 260,000 in the US and 550,000 in China. The global analysis of 29 advanced economies found that each new industrial robot eliminated as many as 1.6 manufacturing jobs on average. In the lower-income areas of the nations in the study, this figure rises to 2.2 jobs, with 1.3 jobs lost in a richer area. Cumbria is the place in Britain most at risk from job losses due to robotic automation, as well as parts of the West Midlands. London and the south-east are most insulated, Oxford Economics said. A year on from the launch of the commission on workers and technology, chaired by the Labour MP Yvette Cooper, the early findings show that technological change has affected most people\u2019s jobs, but workers are not getting a say when this happens. In a speech in Liverpool on Wednesday evening, Cooper is expected to warn that the rapid rollout of new technologies could risk leaving workers behind. \u201cAs technology changes our workplaces, it is workers who should be in the driving seat, but our research shows that workers are too often being shut out of decisions that affect both their working conditions and their enjoyment of work.

Remote care appointments are set up to check on clients throughout the day and to make sure they take the relevant medication. There are 800 home care clients, and nurses carry out 24,000 remote care visits a month. By the end of 2019, the service hopes to cater for 1,100 clients.</p> <p>The potential savings are eye-watering. Whereas a physical home visit costs the equivalent of around \u00a340, a remote care visit is just \u00a34.50. Over the course of one shift, a remote care nurse can carry out over 50 visits \u2013 which works out almost 90% cheaper than if they had knocked on each of their client\u2019s doors. </p> <p>Little wonder that the <a href=\"https://www.hel.fi/palvelukeskus/en\" title=\"\">city\u2019s service centre</a> is hoping to start a remote dinner group soon as well as other sessions. They already take clients virtually to concerts and shows. Hanna H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen, who works as a planner at the service, remembers when she took 64 clients virtually to a carol concert. A screen was placed on the front row and the priest greeted them while they watched at home on their tablets. She remembers: \u201cThe funny thing is that even if some had memory problems, they knew all the lyrics. That is the power of music and made me see that if there\u2019s a concert, we should be there.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you can remotely check in on somebody, see how they are, remind them of medication, that feels like a good solution</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Neighbouring city Espoo is also exploring remote care. By 2027, 8% of its population will be over 75. Roope Lepp\u00e4nen, medical director of Espoo hospital, admits that there aren\u2019t the resources to deal with the increase. \u201cWe see remote care as a possibility. We are only starting but will expand these services quite rapidly in the coming years,\u201d he says. However, he maintains that remote care will never fully replace physical care but that, with advancing technology and future generations that are used to digital life, it will become more and more important. But he doesn\u2019t expect it to totally replace physical care services. \u201cPeople will need physical visits as well. It\u2019s my belief that [remote care] can\u2019t completely replace that, but tech will make [things] even easier in 10 years time.\u201d</p> <p>Both the staff and patients I meet seem to like it. Tiina Kosonen, a remote care nurse, says she is able to build close relationships with her clients. \u201cI like it and the patients get a lot from it. It\u2019s really intensive this contact. We look into each other\u2019s eyes and talk together face to face.\u201d One of her clients, 86-year-old Raimo Uimonen, who has epilepsy and lives alone says: \u201cI get a feeling of security from this service. I also like to talk. This video contact is really important as I get this face-to-face contact and the opportunity to discuss things.\u201d</p> <p>Lepp\u00e4nen adds: \u201cI\u2019ve been on home care visits. You come into a person\u2019s house, take your coat off and sort of intrude. Of course there are some instances where you need to be there, but if we can increase contact with the patient [surely that\u2019s a good thing]?\u201d</p> <p>So could this type of service take off in the UK, where the number of people aged 65 and over is set to increase <a href=\"https://www.ageing-better.org.uk/state-of-ageing\" title=\"\">by more than 40% over the next 20 years</a>?</p> <p>Claire Turner, director of evidence at the Centre for Ageing Better, believes so. \u201cIf you can remotely check in on somebody, see how they are, remind them of medication, that feels like a good and practical solution [as it] enables more time for home visits for people who need physical support,\u201d she says.</p> <p>She adds: \u201cSocial contact is the stuff of life. That\u2019s what is important to us as human beings and it doesn\u2019t change as we get older. If part of the goal of this is to encourage people to have more contact with others who share interests or values, than that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d</p> <p><em>Sarah Johnson\u2019s visit to Helsinki was supported by <a href=\"https://www.businessfinland.fi/en/\" title=\"\">Business Finland</a></em></p>",

I also like to talk. This video contact is really important as I get this face-to-face contact and the opportunity to discuss things.\u201d Lepp\u00e4nen adds: \u201cI\u2019ve been on home care visits. You come into a person\u2019s house, take your coat off and sort of intrude. Of course there are some instances where you need to be there, but if we can increase contact with the patient [surely that\u2019s a good thing]?\u201d So could this type of service take off in the UK, where the number of people aged 65 and over is set to increase by more than 40% over the next 20 years? Claire Turner, director of evidence at the Centre for Ageing Better, believes so. \u201cIf you can remotely check in on somebody, see how they are, remind them of medication, that feels like a good and practical solution [as it] enables more time for home visits for people who need physical support,\u201d she says. She adds: \u201cSocial contact is the stuff of life. That\u2019s what is important to us as human beings and it doesn\u2019t change as we get older. If part of the goal of this is to encourage people to have more contact with others who share interests or values, than that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d Sarah Johnson\u2019s visit to Helsinki was supported by Business Finland",

The rumour started going around that John and I didn\u2019t get on well, we were arch-rivals, that it was very heavy and ugly. The strange thing is you sometimes get to believe something, if it\u2019s said enough times. So I used to think: \u2018Yeah, it\u2019s a pity, you know, we didn\u2019t get on that well.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cSo this picture is a blessing for me. It\u2019s like, this is how we were: this is why we related, or else we couldn\u2019t have collaborated for all that time. It sums up what our relationship was like the minute we were actually working on a song, and most of the time we were together, really. I\u2019m just writing something out \u2013 possibly it\u2019s a medley or something; it might be for Abbey Road \u2013 and it\u2019s lovely, because John is very happily in on the process, and agreeing with me, and we\u2019re laughing about something. Just seeing the joy between us here really helped me, because it reminds me that the idea we weren\u2019t friends is rubbish. We were lifelong friends, our relationship was super-special.</p> <p>\u201cThat applied to all the Beatles, even when we were pissed off with each other from time to time. People used to remind me: that\u2019s families, that happens. Mates disagree. As soon as we started working on music, we gelled, we just enjoyed the noise we made together, we enjoyed playing with each other. We\u2019d worked together for over 10,000 hours over the years, and that old spirit automatically kicked in.

So I don\u2019t get how that worked. It\u2019s not a montage, it\u2019s a straight photo. And the other thing is that I\u2019m driving, and I think Linda is taking the picture with one of our babies on her lap \u2013 if you look, there\u2019s a very faint reflection in the windscreen. Talk about multi-tasking.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the things about Linda, when you talk about how people seem at ease in her photos, is that it was her lifestyle. We\u2019d say: \u2018Let\u2019s go out of London,\u2019 so I\u2019d just drive, we\u2019d get out of London and I\u2019d say: \u2018Where do you want to go?\u2019 She\u2019d say: \u2018Just anywhere.\u2019 After a while, you\u2019d end up in areas you didn\u2019t know, going: \u2018Ooh, I\u2019m getting a bit lost here,\u2019 and she\u2019d say: \u2018Great.\u2019 You were in places you\u2019d never been, you were seeing things you hadn\u2019t intended to see, all of which was rich stuff for her photography. I remember I wrote the song <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_of_Us_(song)\" title=\"\">Two </a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_of_Us_(song)\" title=\"\">of Us</a> about that \u2013 \u2018Two of us riding nowhere / Spending someone\u2019s hard-earned pay.\u2019 That was one of those excursions, when we were first going out together, this great idea of getting lost.

She\u2019d had a reasonably strict upbringing, what with her father being a lawyer, but then she\u2019d started to smell freedom when she went to university in Arizona. She loved riding, she had a horse out there that her friend\u2019s parents let her ride \u2026 it was the dangerous seeds of freedom. And when she met me, I\u2019d been like a robot, having to go on tour, make a record, go on tour, do this \u2013 and I\u2019d had it up to here. So we started to have a life where we didn\u2019t have any plans. We\u2019d go to Greece, book a hotel and just bum around. That feeling, that sniffing freedom, it went all the way through her photography and my music [on 1970\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCartney_(album)\" title=\"\">McCartney</a> and 1971\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram_(album)\" title=\"\">Ram</a>]. </p> <p>\u201cOne day, we were just on the beach, having a swim, but she\u2019s seen this mother and child, and it\u2019s an interesting moment, so she\u2019s just grabbed her camera and snapped it. She wouldn\u2019t have used a whole reel on it; it could even be the only shot. Because she\u2019d had to do things quickly, she\u2019d just worked on the hoof, without an assistant. She didn\u2019t use light meters often \u2013 she guessed \u2013 so she just went out with a pocket stuffed with film, camera around her neck and that would be it. There\u2019s something fascinating about this moment she\u2019s caught, the way the kid is looking into the camera eerily, the mum with this incredible bathing hat on.

I had to do something record-related \u2013 I think it was a convention that Capitol, our American record label, were having \u2013 and she happened to be in LA, so she could hang out with me. She\u2019d turn up at the hotel and we\u2019d say: \u2018Oh, what are we going to do today? Shall we do something? Well, let\u2019s just stay in,\u2019 and we\u2019d just do nothing, basically. We loved that freedom. It was an important thing in a relationship, that neither of us minded doing nothing much.</p> <p>\u201cSo this is us parting after our little trip. I was going back to England and she was catching another flight, going back to New York: I think I was there with a guy called Magic Alex [Mardas, the Beatles\u2019 notorious \u201celectronics wizard\u201d, whose various schemes reputedly cost the band about \u00a35m in today\u2019s money without yielding any results]. While we were waiting, she would just have her camera there, lift it up, click, get the shot, put it down again. So I\u2019m goofing; I\u2019ve pulled my jacket up and sort of masked my face. I\u2019m going back to England, back to the Beatles, and I\u2019m hiding: \u2018No photos please!\u2019 It was just a joyous little moment before we went our separate ways. But, you know, luckily, we hooked up again and, er \u2026 made a go of it!\u201d</p> <p><em>The Linda McCartney Retrospective is at Kelvingrove Art Gallery, Glasgow, from 5 July to 12 January 2020</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "\u2018I always used to joke that I ruined Linda\u2019s career,\u201d says Paul McCartney, sitting on a sofa in his office in Soho, London, with a selection of his late wife\u2019s photographs spread on the table before him. \u201cShe became known as \u2018Paul\u2019s wife\u2019, instead of the focus being on her photography. But, as time went on, people started to realise that she was the real thing. So, yeah, she eventually did get the correct reputation, but at first it was just blown out of the water by the headline-grabbing marriage.\u201d He has a point. Before she met and married him, in March 1969, Linda Eastman was an award-winning photographer. Born in 1941 and raised in a suburb of New York, she had studied under Hazel Archer \u2013 who taught the artist Robert Rauschenberg, among others \u2013 and was the first woman to shoot a Rolling Stone cover, featuring Eric Clapton. Her speciality was capturing pop stars in unguarded moments: a tearful Aretha Franklin; Jimi Hendrix mid-yawn; Janis Joplin backstage, her bottle of Southern Comfort already drained. But marriage to a Beatle tended to overshadow your own work and reputation, as Yoko Ono discovered. It wasn\u2019t until years later that her talent was reappraised: 1976\u2019s unassumingly titled book Linda\u2019s Pictures was the first in a series of collections of her work. If anything, her reputation has grown since her death in 1998 \u2013 The Linda McCartney Retrospective, at Kelvingrove Art Gallery in Glasgow, is just the latest global exhibition of her work. It was curated by McCartney, along with their daughters, Mary and Stella; here, he picks six of his favourite photographs. \u201cAs you can probably tell,\u201d he says, after an exhaustive account of one of the McCartneys\u2019 family holidays in Orkney in the early 70s, \u201cI like talking about this stuff.\u201d BB King, 1968 \u201cThis was taken before I got to know her. Linda was the resident photographer at the [music venue] Fillmore East in New York. She would go to the Fillmore, or other events, and there would be other photographers there, who would say to her: \u2018Who\u2019s this? Who\u2019s this guy playing?\u2019 and she would know. She loved the music so much, she listened to it all the time, so she just knew: this is the Grateful Dead, this is BB King, this is Buddy Guy, this is Janis Joplin, you know? That always comes to mind when I see this picture; I imagine her crouched down, by the stage, taking photos of BB King. \u201cShe was a great believer in the happy accident. Where other people might have said: \u2018Well, this is blurred, we can\u2019t use this one, we\u2019ll go and look for the sharper photographs,\u2019 she went with it. I love this picture \u2013 his guitar looks like an instrument from the future, a space-age thing. It just looks to me like his music sounds: exciting blues. A friend of ours, Brian Clarke, made a stained-glass window of this image, which is fabulous: I\u2019ve got it in my studio.\u201d The Beatles, 1967 \u201cThis is the press launch for Sergeant Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band, at Brian Epstein\u2019s house in Belgravia \u2013 24 Chapel Street [in London].

If you think about the famous Cartier-Bresson photo of the guy jumping over a puddle [Behind the Gare Saint-Lazare, 1932] \u2013 it\u2019s all about capturing that split-second.

I had to do something record-related \u2013 I think it was a convention that Capitol, our American record label, were having \u2013 and she happened to be in LA, so she could hang out with me. She\u2019d turn up at the hotel and we\u2019d say: \u2018Oh, what are we going to do today? Shall we do something? Well, let\u2019s just stay in,\u2019 and we\u2019d just do nothing, basically. We loved that freedom. It was an important thing in a relationship, that neither of us minded doing nothing much. \u201cSo this is us parting after our little trip. I was going back to England and she was catching another flight, going back to New York: I think I was there with a guy called Magic Alex [Mardas, the Beatles\u2019 notorious \u201celectronics wizard\u201d, whose various schemes reputedly cost the band about \u00a35m in today\u2019s money without yielding any results]. While we were waiting, she would just have her camera there, lift it up, click, get the shot, put it down again. So I\u2019m goofing; I\u2019ve pulled my jacket up and sort of masked my face. I\u2019m going back to England, back to the Beatles, and I\u2019m hiding: \u2018No photos please!\u2019 It was just a joyous little moment before we went our separate ways. But, you know, luckily, we hooked up again and, er \u2026 made a go of it!\u201d The Linda McCartney Retrospective is at Kelvingrove Art Gallery, Glasgow, from 5 July to 12 January 2020",

Whatever it might say about its ethical credentials, while it continues to invest in fossil fuels, it accelerates climate breakdown and the death of the habitable planet. You would think this point was obvious to everyone. But over the past few weeks, I have spoken to dozens of environmentalists who appear to believe that Shell is on their side.

The oil company had been subsidising cheap tickets for young people. It might be trashing the world these young people will inherit, but they can watch some great shows. This is bread and circuses \u2013 without the bread.</p> <p>\u201cSurely,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/21/royal-shakespeare-company-rsc-bp-sponsorship-climate-crisis\" title=\"\">Rylance asked</a>, \u201cthe RSC wants to be on the side of the world-changing kids, not the world-killing companies?\u201d To judge by its responses to his complaints across the years, apparently not. But, thanks to campaigning groups such as Platform, Art Not Oil, BP or not BP? and Culture Unstained, theatre companies, museums and art galleries are at least aware that there\u2019s a conflict.</p> <p>Two months ago, Shell announced a $300m fund for \u201c<a href=\"https://www.shell.com/media/news-and-media-releases/2019/shell-invests-in-nature-to-tackle-co2-emissions.html\" title=\"\">investing in natural ecosystems</a>\u201d over the next three years. This, it claims, will help to \u201csupport the transition towards a low-carbon future\u201d. By paying for reforestation, it intends to offset some of the greenhouse gases produced by its oil and gas extraction. In conversations with environmental campaigners from several parts of the world, I keep hearing the same theme: Shell is changing, Shell is sincere \u2013 so shouldn\u2019t we support it?</p> <p>The fund sounds big, and it is \u2013 until you compare it with Shell\u2019s annual income of $24bn. Shell\u2019s transition towards a low-carbon future is almost invisible in its <a href=\"https://reports.shell.com/annual-report/2018/servicepages/disclaimer.php\" title=\"\">annual report</a>. Renewable energy doesn\u2019t figure in its summary of financial results. When I checked with the company, it told me it had no discrete figure for its income from low-carbon technologies. Nor could it tell me how much it invested in them last year. But it did pour $25bn of investment into oil and gas in 2018, including exploration for new fossil fuel reserves in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico and off the coasts of Brazil and Mauritania. Among its assets are 1,400 mineral leases in Canada, where it makes synthetic crude oil from tar sands. Some transition.</p> <p>Shell\u2019s \u201ccash engines\u201d, according to its annual report, are oil and gas. There is no sign that it plans to turn the engines off. Its \u201cgrowth priorities\u201d are chemical production and deep water oil extraction. It does list low-carbon energy among its \u201cemerging opportunities\u201d in future decades, but says it will develop them alongside fracking and liquefied fossil gas technologies. In the future, the <a href=\"https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/what-is-shells-net-carbon-footprint-ambition.html\" title=\"\">company says</a>, it will \u201csell more natural gas\u201d. But as an <a href=\"http://priceofoil.org/content/uploads/2019/05/gasBridgeMyth_web-FINAL.pdf\" title=\"\">analysis by Oil Change International</a> explains, \u201cthere is no room for new fossil fuel development \u2013 gas included \u2013 within the Paris agreement goals\u201d. Even existing gas and oil extraction is enough to push us past 1.5C of global heating. Shell is a company committed for the long term to fossil fuel production \u2013 which is another way of saying ecocide.</p> <p>It is also explicit about the purpose of schemes such as its natural ecosystems fund.

      "bodyText": "It is hard to believe it needs stating, but it does. The oil industry is not your friend. Whatever it might say about its ethical credentials, while it continues to invest in fossil fuels, it accelerates climate breakdown and the death of the habitable planet. You would think this point was obvious to everyone. But over the past few weeks, I have spoken to dozens of environmentalists who appear to believe that Shell is on their side. I\u2019ve come to the bizarre conclusion that there is more awareness of the oil industry\u2019s agenda within the arts than there is among conservation groups. Last week, the actor Mark Rylance brilliantly articulated his reasons for resigning from the Royal Shakespeare Company over its sponsorship by BP. The oil company had been subsidising cheap tickets for young people. It might be trashing the world these young people will inherit, but they can watch some great shows. This is bread and circuses \u2013 without the bread. \u201cSurely,\u201d Rylance asked, \u201cthe RSC wants to be on the side of the world-changing kids, not the world-killing companies?\u201d To judge by its responses to his complaints across the years, apparently not. But, thanks to campaigning groups such as Platform, Art Not Oil, BP or not BP? and Culture Unstained, theatre companies, museums and art galleries are at least aware that there\u2019s a conflict. Two months ago, Shell announced a $300m fund for \u201cinvesting in natural ecosystems\u201d over the next three years. This, it claims, will help to \u201csupport the transition towards a low-carbon future\u201d. By paying for reforestation, it intends to offset some of the greenhouse gases produced by its oil and gas extraction. In conversations with environmental campaigners from several parts of the world, I keep hearing the same theme: Shell is changing, Shell is sincere \u2013 so shouldn\u2019t we support it? The fund sounds big, and it is \u2013 until you compare it with Shell\u2019s annual income of $24bn. Shell\u2019s transition towards a low-carbon future is almost invisible in its annual report. Renewable energy doesn\u2019t figure in its summary of financial results. When I checked with the company, it told me it had no discrete figure for its income from low-carbon technologies. Nor could it tell me how much it invested in them last year. But it did pour $25bn of investment into oil and gas in 2018, including exploration for new fossil fuel reserves in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico and off the coasts of Brazil and Mauritania. Among its assets are 1,400 mineral leases in Canada, where it makes synthetic crude oil from tar sands. Some transition. Shell\u2019s \u201ccash engines\u201d, according to its annual report, are oil and gas. There is no sign that it plans to turn the engines off. Its \u201cgrowth priorities\u201d are chemical production and deep water oil extraction. It does list low-carbon energy among its \u201cemerging opportunities\u201d in future decades, but says it will develop them alongside fracking and liquefied fossil gas technologies. In the future, the company says, it will \u201csell more natural gas\u201d. But as an analysis by Oil Change International explains, \u201cthere is no room for new fossil fuel development \u2013 gas included \u2013 within the Paris agreement goals\u201d. Even existing gas and oil extraction is enough to push us past 1.5C of global heating. Shell is a company committed for the long term to fossil fuel production \u2013 which is another way of saying ecocide. It is also explicit about the purpose of schemes such as its natural ecosystems fund. The company\u2019s success, its chairman says, \u201cwill depend largely on whether society trusts us. Investors invest in companies they trust, governments allow trusted companies to operate and consumers buy things from people they trust.\u201d Among the company\u2019s strategic ambitions is \u201cto sustain a strong societal licence to operate\u201d. Restoring natural ecosystems is crucial to preventing climate breakdown. As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) points out, drawing down large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is essential if we are to stand any chance of preventing more than 1.5C or even 2C of global heating.

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it.

Writing in the Guardian, Andrew Sentance, a former member of the interest rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC) at the Bank of England, said companies would want a safe pair of hands running Britain, rather than the \u201cerratic\u201d Johnson. \u201cThe political world is in turmoil and the idea that Boris Johnson will become our prime minister fills me \u2013 and many other businesspeople \u2013 with horror,\u201d he said. David Blanchflower, another former member of the MPC, also writing in the Guardian, said either Johnson or Hunt taking Britain out of the EU without a deal would damage living standards. \u201cDiscussions of who will be prime minister are increasingly looking like a clown show, and as far as discussions of economics go, they are basically in fantasyland,\u201d he said. To gauge the impact of Brexit on a monthly basis, the Guardian monitors eight economic indicators, along with the value of the pound and the performance of the FTSE 100. Economists made forecasts for seven of those barometers before their release, and in three cases the outcome was worse than expected. In three cases, better. One met its forecast. Since the Brexit vote three years ago this month, the cost to the economy from lower economic growth than would have otherwise been the case under a remain vote has reached \u00a340bn, or about \u00a3800m a week of lost income \u2013 more than double the \u00a3350m figure printed on the side of the Vote Leave battlebus used by Johnson. The economy has not, however, collapsed into recession, as predicted by the gloomiest forecasts made ahead of the EU referendum, while unemployment has dropped to the lowest level since the mid-1970s and average workers\u2019 wages have accelerated at the fastest annual rate since the financial crisis. But storm clouds are beginning to emerge after jobs growth slowed markedly over the three months to April. Average wages after inflation remain below the level recorded before the 2008 crash, while consumer spending dropped in May, driven by cold weather and Brexit concerns. Fuelled by rising numbers of self-employed people and women entering the workforce, employment in Britain increased by 32,000 to reach a record high of 32.75m, according to the Office for National Statistics. The rise was the weakest since August 2018 and significantly down on the 99,000 added to the workforce in March, suggesting that Brexit-related uncertainty is beginning to make companies more cautious about hiring. Economic growth in Britain had raced ahead earlier this year, driven by a stockpiling rush as companies scrambled to prepare for no-deal Brexit ahead of a 29 March deadline, before Theresa May extended the process until the autumn. GDP growth reached 0.5% in the first quarter. However, the Bank of England warned this month the economy would flatline in the second quarter, slashing its forecast to zero from a previous estimate of 0.2%. Threadneedle Street warned that some companies would run down their emergency stockpiles over the next few months rather than place new orders, serving as a brake on growth. The Bank\u2019s network of regional agents said firms are as ready as they can be for Brexit, but that a lack of clarity from Westminster stops them from feeling fully prepared. In an early sign of the slowdown, GDP plunged by 0.4% in April from a month earlier as factories launched a wave of planned shutdowns around the time of the 29 March Brexit deadline. Blanchflower said: \u201cWe should expect an impact over the coming months even if no deal is avoided. The Bank expects zero growth in the second quarter, but it might well even be negative.\u201d",

After his 2006 election defeat, he took Fidesz to the streets as an anti-establishment movement. He soon capitalised on a large government scandal and the 2008 financial crisis. When in 2010 Fidesz gained a parliamentary supermajority, Orb\u00e1n embarked on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/06/hungary-democratic-dictator-europe\" title=\"\">new form of regime change</a> to consolidate his hold on power.

During that period I tried to understand why Hungarians weren\u2019t revolting against overt patronage politics and the concentration of power. Why was a country that had fought for its freedom, and gained it, seemingly giving in to the unacceptable?</p> <p>Much has been said about the opposition\u2019s fragmentation and its failure to develop a strong alternative narrative to Orb\u00e1n\u2019s. But we should also be aware that the now huge gap between Fidesz\u2019s financial resources and those of other parties, as well as the uneven access to media coverage, have done much to compound the problem. It is also hard to overlook how collective historical traumas have been exploited: the memory of the post-first world war Trianon treaty, in which Hungary lost most of its territory and population, a taboo for 70 years, has returned with a bang.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1675b1c1168206426e6857fced10f803efd0f84d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1675b1c1168206426e6857fced10f803efd0f84d/0_359_5390_3234/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A message to the EU is held aloft during a protest in Budapest on 2 June over the Hungarian government\u2019s controversial education and research policies.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A message to the EU is held aloft during a protest in Budapest on 2 June over the Hungarian government\u2019s controversial education and research policies.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Attila Kisbenedek/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>EU accession was the main collective identity-building concept of post-1989 socialist-led governments but, to a certain degree, the issue of national identity fell by the wayside. Orb\u00e1n could therefore claim that he was picking up the mantle of the fight for Hungary\u2019s sovereignty and protecting Hungarians from future existential threats, however imaginary. This brand of ethnic nationalism has stood at the heart of his anti-migrant, anti-EU campaign.</p> <p>There is of course a deep irony in the fact that <a href=\"https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries/member-countries/hungary_en\" title=\"\">EU funds (which account for </a><a href=\"https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries/member-countries/hungary_en\" title=\"\">3.5% of GDP)</a> were precisely what allowed Orb\u00e1n to prop up the economy, increase wages, cut public utility fees and so on. He also took personal credit for the country\u2019s financial stability. Building up an artificial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/29/budapest-viktor-orban-democracy-edge-hungary\" title=\"\">threat</a> and combining that with paternalistic social policies, helped create a mindset in which the leader alone could guide the people to a bright future: the leader, not democratic institutions. </p> <p>It took the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/03/migration-crisis-hungary-pm-victor-orban-europe-response-madness\" title=\"\">2015 migration crisis</a>, Brexit and the election of Donald Trump for complacent European elites to understand that Orb\u00e1n represented a threat to the integrity of western democratic principles, and that he could even paralyse the EU. He is no doubt a talented opportunist, but I believe his strength has been drawn as much from exhausted European politics as from his ability to cast himself as a trendsetter.</p> <p>The good news is that last month\u2019s European parliament elections \u2013 in which nationalist-populist forces did not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/27/european-elections-far-right-surge-ends-in-a-ripple\" title=\"\">break through</a> \u2013 clearly showed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/27/european-elections-far-right-surge-ends-in-a-ripple\" title=\"\">Orb\u00e1n\u2019s influence</a> had reached some kind of limit. See how his efforts are now focused on remaining within the mainstream rightwing European People\u2019s party, rather than have Fidesz end up outside of it. Still, if he is left unchallenged at a European level, his hold on power will only tighten. With all the fear that he has sown in Hungarian minds, the best response must be for democratic forces across the continent to show that a more united European Union is the best way to protect the stability and security people want.</p> <p>Hungary may be a small country but the lessons its people have learned must serve everyone.</p> <p>\u2022 Zsuzsanna Szel\u00e9nyi is a psychologist and former member of the Hungarian parliament</p>",

After his 2006 election defeat, he took Fidesz to the streets as an anti-establishment movement. He soon capitalised on a large government scandal and the 2008 financial crisis. When in 2010 Fidesz gained a parliamentary supermajority, Orb\u00e1n embarked on a new form of regime change to consolidate his hold on power. The constitution was rewritten, as were laws governing the media and elections. A loyal oligarchy was nurtured on EU funds, some of which were awarded to his 32-year-old son-in-law\u2019s firm. I re-entered parliament in 2014 as a liberal politician in opposition to Fidesz. During that period I tried to understand why Hungarians weren\u2019t revolting against overt patronage politics and the concentration of power. Why was a country that had fought for its freedom, and gained it, seemingly giving in to the unacceptable? Much has been said about the opposition\u2019s fragmentation and its failure to develop a strong alternative narrative to Orb\u00e1n\u2019s. But we should also be aware that the now huge gap between Fidesz\u2019s financial resources and those of other parties, as well as the uneven access to media coverage, have done much to compound the problem. It is also hard to overlook how collective historical traumas have been exploited: the memory of the post-first world war Trianon treaty, in which Hungary lost most of its territory and population, a taboo for 70 years, has returned with a bang. EU accession was the main collective identity-building concept of post-1989 socialist-led governments but, to a certain degree, the issue of national identity fell by the wayside. Orb\u00e1n could therefore claim that he was picking up the mantle of the fight for Hungary\u2019s sovereignty and protecting Hungarians from future existential threats, however imaginary. This brand of ethnic nationalism has stood at the heart of his anti-migrant, anti-EU campaign. There is of course a deep irony in the fact that EU funds (which account for 3.5% of GDP) were precisely what allowed Orb\u00e1n to prop up the economy, increase wages, cut public utility fees and so on. He also took personal credit for the country\u2019s financial stability. Building up an artificial threat and combining that with paternalistic social policies, helped create a mindset in which the leader alone could guide the people to a bright future: the leader, not democratic institutions. It took the 2015 migration crisis, Brexit and the election of Donald Trump for complacent European elites to understand that Orb\u00e1n represented a threat to the integrity of western democratic principles, and that he could even paralyse the EU. He is no doubt a talented opportunist, but I believe his strength has been drawn as much from exhausted European politics as from his ability to cast himself as a trendsetter. The good news is that last month\u2019s European parliament elections \u2013 in which nationalist-populist forces did not break through \u2013 clearly showed that Orb\u00e1n\u2019s influence had reached some kind of limit. See how his efforts are now focused on remaining within the mainstream rightwing European People\u2019s party, rather than have Fidesz end up outside of it. Still, if he is left unchallenged at a European level, his hold on power will only tighten. With all the fear that he has sown in Hungarian minds, the best response must be for democratic forces across the continent to show that a more united European Union is the best way to protect the stability and security people want. Hungary may be a small country but the lessons its people have learned must serve everyone. \u2022 Zsuzsanna Szel\u00e9nyi is a psychologist and former member of the Hungarian parliament",

It is set in 1900 in Vienna, then the most vibrant city in Europe where about a 10th of the population were Jewish.</p> <p>Stoppard is known for being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/sep/06/stoppard.theatre\">an impersonal writer</a>, rarely drawing on autobiography.

      "bodyText": "Tom Stoppard, whose four Jewish grandparents and much of his family from his parents\u2019 generation died in Nazi concentration camps, is returning to the West End with what is likely to be his most personal play. The 81-year-old playwright has spent the last year writing Leopoldstadt, his first play since The Hard Problem at the National Theatre in early 2015. It is set in 1900 in Vienna, then the most vibrant city in Europe where about a 10th of the population were Jewish. Stoppard is known for being an impersonal writer, rarely drawing on autobiography. When asked where he got his ideas from, he has often replied: \u201cHarrods.\u201d His new play is different. \u201cIt took a year to write but the gestation was much longer,\u201d he said. \u201cQuite a lot of it is personal to me but I made it about a Viennese family so that it wouldn\u2019t seem to be about me.\u201d He said the play, directed by Patrick Marber and produced by Sonia Friedman, was a big one that needed a large company. \u201cSonia wants to go straight into the West End with it, which I find quite exciting \u2013 like the old days with [the producer] Michael Codron. \u201cI\u2019m astonished to see that it\u2019s five years since my last play The Hard Problem.

The cute little creatures pop up on a map of your surroundings as you explore on foot, and you just have to catch them. At Pok\u00e9stops dotted around the world, you spin a disk (often tied to a local landmark) to receive the balls needed to catch Pokemon, as well as assorted presents (more balls, stardust, eggs that hatch into new creatures).</p> <p>It\u2019s a social game too \u2013 sort of. You can team up with other players to battle more powerful Pok\u00e9mon at \u201cgyms\u201d, or swap Pok\u00e9mon with your friends (that\u2019s \u201cfriends\u201d in the social media sense \u2013 in other words, not really your friends. Or are they? It\u2019s complicated).</p> <p>Before the storm in Chicago descends, I bump into an attractive middle-aged couple catching Pok\u00e9mon in the park.

Many players are my age \u2013 give or take 20 years. It\u2019s never kids, and it\u2019s always a mixed crowd: Latino construction workers, women in business suits, journalists. We gather on street corners, a secret society exchanging furtive nods and tips, waiting for the battle to begin.</p> <p>\u201cPsst. There are Snorlax in Bryant Park.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou wanna trade a shiny?\u201d</p> <p>Then we hammer away at our phones for a few moments before dispersing. Most often, we don\u2019t exchange a word.</p> <p>So what could explain this passion? It\u2019s a question I\u2019ve often asked myself, and I have theories.</p> <p>First, there\u2019s BF Skinner. Skinner, an American psychologist, developed the concept of \u201coperant conditioning\u201d, which shows how rewards and punishments modify behaviour. While Skinner had pigeons and rats pecking at buttons for food for his experiments, I am checking my phone for virtual rewards. A lot of the time I don\u2019t get what I want, and this, it turns out, feeds my addiction. Subjects (pigeons, rats, me) tire of a task if they always get what they want. If it\u2019s more hit and miss, they stay interested.</p> <p>Skinner\u2019s research helps explain why we still keep looking at Facebook, Instagram, our increasingly unmanageable emails.

      "bodyText": "A thunderstorm is rolling towards Chicago\u2019s Grant Park. The thousands of people gathered for the city\u2019s third annual Pok\u00e9mon Go Fest, already sodden after a day of drizzle and rain, are now being told to evacuate for fear of lightning strikes. But I need to take a snapshot of a Gastly in the Spooky Woods if I\u2019m going to complete this year\u2019s festival challenge and uncover a rare new Pok\u00e9mon. And I don\u2019t have a Gastly. Risking death by lightning, I jog towards the Spooky Woods. My name is Dominic. I\u2019m 52. I have two twentysomething children and a part-share in a Pulitzer prize. I read philosophy and listen to Stockhausen for fun. And I love Pok\u00e9mon Go. I also hate myself for it: my boyfriend rolls his eyes when I play, my kids think it\u2019s sad, and the colleagues who know about it probably secretly judge me. It is my secret shame, but I am not alone. For those who have been hiding under a Bulbasaur, Pok\u00e9mon Go is an augmented reality game where players, armed with their phones, collect Pok\u00e9mon in the real world. The cute little creatures pop up on a map of your surroundings as you explore on foot, and you just have to catch them. At Pok\u00e9stops dotted around the world, you spin a disk (often tied to a local landmark) to receive the balls needed to catch Pokemon, as well as assorted presents (more balls, stardust, eggs that hatch into new creatures). It\u2019s a social game too \u2013 sort of. You can team up with other players to battle more powerful Pok\u00e9mon at \u201cgyms\u201d, or swap Pok\u00e9mon with your friends (that\u2019s \u201cfriends\u201d in the social media sense \u2013 in other words, not really your friends. Or are they? It\u2019s complicated). Before the storm in Chicago descends, I bump into an attractive middle-aged couple catching Pok\u00e9mon in the park. The pair would look more at home sipping smoothies after pilates than stalking digital creatures with their phones. When I get out my notebook, they exchange a look. He is a sales director for a Fortune 500 company, and she runs a non-profit. They will only give me their Pok\u00e9mon Go handles: Oceanna131450 and BeachBaby503. \u201cWe\u2019re closeted,\u201d she says. \u201cNobody at work knows I play.\u201d BeachBaby503 says their children got them into Pok\u00e9mon Go when it launched in 2016. Their kids soon stopped playing, but they never have. They are both level 40, the highest level in the game (I am a 36.) Oceanna131450 hit 40 in year one and has walked 6,234km in the game \u2013 roughly the distance between Chicago and Panama. \u201cWe\u2019re very goal-oriented,\u201d he laughs. I, too, have been playing Pok\u00e9mon Go since the app was launched. In the beginning, I hid my obsession in plain sight. Everyone was doing it: the app had been downloaded 500m times by the end of the year. Celebrities had Pok\u00e9mon fever, and even my co-workers were taking ironic snapshots of Pok\u00e9mon at Trump rallies. Then Hillary Clinton ruined it all, as she has so many things. \u201cPok\u00e9mon Go to the polls!\u201d she shouted at a rally in Ohio, ensuring Trump\u2019s victory and ending the golden dawn of the Pok\u00e9mon age. The fad faded. But not for me \u2013 I went underground. Three years on, I have walked 1,841km in Pok\u00e9-land, or 1,144 miles. That\u2019s the distance between New York City and Orlando, Florida. I have caught more than 11,000 Pok\u00e9mon, flicking balls at critters in Stockport, Greater Manchester, and in Tokyo, Mexico City, Miami and Jackson, Mississippi. If I\u2019ve been there, I have Pok\u00e9moned. I frequently sneak out to battle in raids to win rare Pok\u00e9mon on street corners with equally furtive-looking strangers. Many players are my age \u2013 give or take 20 years. It\u2019s never kids, and it\u2019s always a mixed crowd: Latino construction workers, women in business suits, journalists. We gather on street corners, a secret society exchanging furtive nods and tips, waiting for the battle to begin. \u201cPsst. There are Snorlax in Bryant Park.\u201d \u201cYou wanna trade a shiny?\u201d Then we hammer away at our phones for a few moments before dispersing. Most often, we don\u2019t exchange a word. So what could explain this passion? It\u2019s a question I\u2019ve often asked myself, and I have theories. First, there\u2019s BF Skinner. Skinner, an American psychologist, developed the concept of \u201coperant conditioning\u201d, which shows how rewards and punishments modify behaviour. While Skinner had pigeons and rats pecking at buttons for food for his experiments, I am checking my phone for virtual rewards. A lot of the time I don\u2019t get what I want, and this, it turns out, feeds my addiction. Subjects (pigeons, rats, me) tire of a task if they always get what they want. If it\u2019s more hit and miss, they stay interested. Skinner\u2019s research helps explain why we still keep looking at Facebook, Instagram, our increasingly unmanageable emails. We are looking for that hit again amid all those yawn-inducing misses. Operant conditioning, however, can\u2019t take all the blame. I have been hooked on other apps: Words With Friends, Draw With Friends, Dots, all the way back to Snake. But in every case, my devotion soon died. Why does Pok\u00e9mon still have my heart? Enter Guy Debord, my favorite French Marxist theorist and founding member of the Situationist International. Debord\u2019s most famous 1967 work, Society of the Spectacle, foresaw a new era of capitalism where the masses would be pacified and distracted by \u201cthe spectacle\u201d \u2013 the reduction of our lives to a never-ending and all-consuming stream of media, images and messages. Sacr\u00e9 bleu! Was he ever right. To disrupt the spectacle, the Situationists had a tool called d\u00e9rive, a sort of unstructured urban wandering that allowed people to reclaim the landscape for their own purposes. Pok\u00e9mon Go isn\u2019t quite what Debord had in mind, but when I play in a shopping mall, an airport, a museum, or in the line at the DMV, those landscapes are being repurposed. A new layer is imposed on top of the prescribed one, the map is redrawn, functions are subverted. I turn left when I should go right, north when I should go south, just to explore a new part of the city. Pok\u00e9mon gives me an excuse to wander. Which is why, back at Chicago\u2019s Pok\u00e9mon Go Fest, I find myself in a field risking my life for a Gastly, hoping to find the true reason behind my Pok\u00e9mon addiction. Over the three-day event, 60,000 people gathered in the magnificent surroundings of Grant Park, walking 290,000km and catching 15m Pok\u00e9mon. Pretty impressive for a fad that has supposedly fizzled. The park was divided into zones. You can catch ice-type Pok\u00e9mon in the Winter Forest (fitted out with snow machines and mini mountains), ghost types like my missing Gastly were in the Spooky Woods (where cobwebs hung from the trees), while others were hiding in the Fairy Garden, or the Sandy Desert. The crowd has to be the most mixed event group I have ever seen. There are kids, but they don\u2019t seem to be playing (it costs $25 to play at the event and they were just along for the ride). There are black, white, Asian and Hispanic Pok\u00e9mon hunters. Some of the older ones are in motorized wheelchairs. It\u2019s about a 50-50 split between men and women. Everyone is staring at their phones, but when I interrupt them, they couldn\u2019t be nicer. As the rain starts, I shelter under a tree. \u201cDo you want a rain poncho?

In the US, the Trump administration is bedding down and expanding its network of punitive refugee camps. Like Australia\u2019s, they have a dual function: as a deterrent to pursuing the right of political asylum, and as a political weapon.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s nightmare, like the USA\u2019s, has been long in the making. It is a bipartisan creation. Labor, under Paul Keating, instituted the policy of mandatory detention. John Howard did much of the work of shaping it into permanent nightmare, and of turning the issue of refugees into a cudgel with which to smite political opponents.</p> <p>Howard created temporary protection visas in the late 1990s, leaving even successful applicants in a state of uncertainty. He fought and won an election on the issue of asylum seekers in 2001, establishing arbitrary cruelty as a political tactic to be used again by him and his successors. In the first years of the century, he excised large swathes of Australian territory from its migration zones, legislated the right to remove migrant vessels from Australian waters, and moved away from contested facilities like Woomera to the so-called \u201cPacific solution\u201d. Asylum seekers were increasingly out of reach for Australia\u2019s media and those who opposed the policies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/16/humanitarian-activist-migrants-scott-warren\">Is showing compassion to migrants a crime? | Moustafa Bayoumi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Later embellishments under the Abbott and Morrison governments brought down total secrecy on interceptions, the practice of turning back boats at sea, and removed any hope that migrants arriving by sea might one day be granted permission to live in Australia.</p> <p>Labor, after years of vacillating and ineffectual opposition to Howard\u2019s policies, has long since capitulated on all of the important points. Despite fights around the edges on issues like Medevac, Labor\u2019s surrender to the main thrust of asylum policy during the Rudd-Gillard era still holds.</p> <p>It\u2019s long been observed that any network of camps, once established, becomes worse. As Andrea Pitzer shows in her history of concentration camps, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/One-Long-Night-History-Concentration-ebook/dp/B01N7O6HJ0\">One Long Night</a>, over and over again since the invention of concentration camps in the late 19th century, in each iteration they develop their own terrible, internal logic. Laws are circumvented or changed, secrecy inhibits scrutiny, logistical problems complicate detention such that the brunt is always borne by prisoners, and a dynamic of brutalisation sweeps up prisoner, jailer and the whole society surrounding them.</p> <p>Even if such camps are not deliberately constructed for the purposes of murder, they kill people. In Australia\u2019s camps, dozens have died, a score or more at their own hands. One of those, Omid Masoumali, set himself alight on Nauru during a UN inspection of the facility.

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s economy is increasingly in the doldrums, but our leaders can point to a successful export of their own devising. In the US, the Trump administration is bedding down and expanding its network of punitive refugee camps. Like Australia\u2019s, they have a dual function: as a deterrent to pursuing the right of political asylum, and as a political weapon. Australia\u2019s nightmare, like the USA\u2019s, has been long in the making. It is a bipartisan creation. Labor, under Paul Keating, instituted the policy of mandatory detention. John Howard did much of the work of shaping it into permanent nightmare, and of turning the issue of refugees into a cudgel with which to smite political opponents. Howard created temporary protection visas in the late 1990s, leaving even successful applicants in a state of uncertainty. He fought and won an election on the issue of asylum seekers in 2001, establishing arbitrary cruelty as a political tactic to be used again by him and his successors. In the first years of the century, he excised large swathes of Australian territory from its migration zones, legislated the right to remove migrant vessels from Australian waters, and moved away from contested facilities like Woomera to the so-called \u201cPacific solution\u201d. Asylum seekers were increasingly out of reach for Australia\u2019s media and those who opposed the policies. Later embellishments under the Abbott and Morrison governments brought down total secrecy on interceptions, the practice of turning back boats at sea, and removed any hope that migrants arriving by sea might one day be granted permission to live in Australia. Labor, after years of vacillating and ineffectual opposition to Howard\u2019s policies, has long since capitulated on all of the important points. Despite fights around the edges on issues like Medevac, Labor\u2019s surrender to the main thrust of asylum policy during the Rudd-Gillard era still holds. It\u2019s long been observed that any network of camps, once established, becomes worse. As Andrea Pitzer shows in her history of concentration camps, One Long Night, over and over again since the invention of concentration camps in the late 19th century, in each iteration they develop their own terrible, internal logic. Laws are circumvented or changed, secrecy inhibits scrutiny, logistical problems complicate detention such that the brunt is always borne by prisoners, and a dynamic of brutalisation sweeps up prisoner, jailer and the whole society surrounding them. Even if such camps are not deliberately constructed for the purposes of murder, they kill people. In Australia\u2019s camps, dozens have died, a score or more at their own hands. One of those, Omid Masoumali, set himself alight on Nauru during a UN inspection of the facility. Untold numbers of current and former detainees struggle with mental illness as a result of their detention. Australia\u2019s camps are now baked into its national politics. They look set to remain as long as there are elections to win, focus groups to placate, and no outside agency truly capable of enforcing any consequences for its architects. The longer that they are in place in the US, Italy and elsewhere, the more likely it is that in those countries, too, they will become permanent features of the political landscape. As white settler cultures, Australia and the United States share many things. And one is a long history of confining and concentrating people that the settler population determines to be undesirable. In both countries, genocidal hot wars against native populations petered out into a practice dumping remnant indigenous people into reservations or missions. The US starting using concentration camps in the modern sense in the Philippines at the very beginning of the 20th century. Both Australia and the United States interned Japanese and German residents as enemy aliens in the second world war; Australia also interned up to 20% of its resident Italians. The United States continues to operate its detention camp at Guantanamo Bay. Neither country is a stranger to indefinitely imprisoning innocent or untried people. Australia\u2019s innovation \u2013 one taken up in Europe as well as the United States \u2013 was in beginning in earnest to dismantle an always-fragile global consensus on the proper treatment of refugees. The countries that had defeated fascism implicitly recognised that their own failure to do more to help refugees had delivered hostages to the Nazi regime, and had passively contributed to the nightmare of the Holocaust and its network of camps. It was not always perfectly honoured \u2013 and in the case of the US, a great deal of emphasis was put on accommodating refugees from communist nations, with a view to scoring propaganda victories \u2013 but for the half century following the signing of the UN Charter on Refugees in 1951, liberal democracies paid some level of respect to the notion of political asylum as a human right. Australia turned that on its head when it started down the road of arbitrarily punishing those fleeing war, violence and persecution. When conservatives then aggressively politicised that fact, they created a model. Back in 2014, the scholar Angela Mitropoulos wrote in the wake of the initiation of Operation Sovereign Borders that \u201cthis downward spiral is not just Australia\u2019s problem. Australia has long been a laboratory for the invention and export of policies around the world\u201d. She argued that the opposition to camps cannot succeed on the basis of national politics, that opposition must globalised. The deterioration of the overfilled camps on America\u2019s southern border, and the moves to house people on military bases and former internment camps, show that she was right. The worsening conditions those camps have been associated with include deaths, family separations and serious mistreatment of asylum seekers. Trump has tightened restrictions on how, who and how many people can apply for asylum. The administration has dramatically raised the bar for asylum applications with fees, additional rules and long delays as people wait in camps. He has threatened blanket measures to deny asylum altogether to Central Americans waiting in Mexico. And they have sought to turn Americans \u2013 or at least the Republican base \u2013 more firmly against immigrants and asylum seekers. He and his administration have stepped up dehumanising language about asylum seekers and migrants. He has taken every opportunity to make political hay from scare stories about asylum seekers. All the while, conservatives have sought to avoid calling these camps by their most appropriate name. The Australian experience suggests that once established, such camps are difficult to dislodge within the routines of national politics. To disestablish these camps anywhere, we need to oppose them everywhere. Jason Wilson is a Guardian Australia columnist",

Timor-Leste is facing devastating economic conditions as reserves of their current resource projects \u2013 which provide up to 80% of the country\u2019s revenue \u2013 are expected to run out in the next few years. Greater Sunrise is not expected to be developed in time for revenue to cover the gap, and the Timorese government has pushed to diversify in recent years with eyebrow-raising, large-scale infrastructure projects. In April Guardian Australia revealed Australia continued to draw millions of dollars in oil revenue from projects which the treaty had determined belonged to Timor-Leste, because of an agreement that the terms would not apply until the treaty was ratified.",

The former Wallaby\u2019s GoFundMe page was taken down this week for breaching the platform\u2019s terms of service. The Australian Christian Lobby\u2019s fundraising drive stands at almost $1.8m on Wednesday afternoon but it says it has not breached federal laws governing charity operations. Folau had his $4m rugby employment contract terminated in May, after he made social media posts saying hell awaits \u201cdrunks, homosexuals, adulterers, liars, fornicators, thieves, atheists and idolaters\u201d. The posts were deemed a high-level breach of RA\u2019s code of conduct after previous warnings from the governing body not to denigrate people on the basis of their sexuality. The Australian Charities and Not-for-Profits Commission declined to specify how many complaints it has received. It said it would not comment on the circumstances of individual charities. \u201cGenerally, the ACNC can investigate where there are concerns that a registered charity has breached the ACNC Act or our governance standards,\u201d the commission said in a statement. \u201cThis may include if a charity is not pursuing its charitable purpose, not operating in a not-for-profit manner, or giving private benefits to its members.\u201d The Australian Christian Lobby insists it is not in breach of its charitable purposes by raising money for Folau\u2019s legal case. Its managing director, Martyn Iles, said the organisation\u2019s purposes included the \u201cadvancement of the Christian religion and advocating for changes in law and public policy\u201d. Iles said the sacking of Folau and the removal of his GoFundMe page confirmed the concerns of \u201cquiet Australians\u201d. \u201cThese are the same quiet Australians who spoke up for religious freedom through their vote at the federal election, and now they are speaking again with their wallets in a way that cannot be ignored.\u201d The Folau dispute could become a test case for religious freedom in Australia. Folau believes he has been the victim of discrimination on religious grounds. Employment lawyers have raised their eyebrows at the $3m fundraising target.

He said the case could be run comfortably for $300,000-$400,000, bearing in mind that most cases settle before a trial so it could be less. If the case was to progress to the federal court for appeal that might add an extra $100,000 on to the tab, followed by an extra $150,000 if it reaches a high court appeal. \u201cI find the whole notion of a multimillionaire crowd-funding for his legal expenses highly problematic and dubious,\u201d Bornstein said. Folau\u2019s property empire has an estimated worth of about $7m and he recently sold a $500,000 Lamborghini. The Australian Christian Lobby has vowed to review legal cost estimates. Meanwhile, ANZ has denied it pressured Netball New Zealand over Maria Folau\u2019s support for her husband\u2019s campaign.

      "bodyText": "The Department of Home Affairs has pushed back on growing calls to decriminalise amphetamine-type drugs, warning any move to change state laws would create \u201clegal ambiguity\u201d and lead to \u201cperverse outcomes\u201d. A New South Wales government-commissioned inquiry into the drug ice and other amphetamine-type stimulants is considering legalisation or decriminalisation as a means of addressing growing prevalence of crystal methamphetamine addiction in parts of the state. Established in November last year following a spate of ice-related deaths, the inquiry has heard from a chorus of health and legal experts including the NSW Bar Association, who say the criminalisation of drug addicts may be causing more harm than drug use itself. But the federal Department of Home Affairs, headed by Peter Dutton, has pushed back strongly on any attempt by the states to change drug policy. Despite the vast majority of organisations in favour of decriminalisation for personal drug use explicitly stating their support for maintaining laws around trafficking and importation, home affairs has argued any move to decriminalisation would create \u201cuncertainty for law enforcement and at the Australian border\u201d. In its submission, the department claimed organised crime groups would \u201cseek to exploit and to capitalise on any ambiguity or gaps in legislative frameworks\u201d if NSW considered changes to state law. It said decriminalisation or legalisation of amphetamine-type stimulants by NSW \u201cwould create legal ambiguity\u201d between the state and the commonwealth, and argued that \u201cpiecemeal decriminalisation\u201d could \u201clead to perverse legal outcomes\u201d. But other law enforcement agencies appear to disagree. The NSW Crime Commission, which investigates serious and organised criminal activity in the state, took a different view in its submission, stating that current law enforcement efforts to stop importation and distribution of ice were \u201cnot very effective in reducing the production and supply\u201d. The commission pointed to the high proportion of government spending which goes to enforcement strategies compared with harm reduction, and said that harsh law enforcement responses aimed at drug users have been found to have a negative effect on society and often exacerbate the problem. It also pointed to evidence of positive societal impacts harm reduction strategies can have. \u201cThe first medically supervised injecting centre (MSIC) opened in Kings Cross in 2001. As of 2015 almost one million injections have been supervised at this facility, with the management of almost 6,000 overdoses and no reported fatalities,\u201d the commission\u2019s submission said. \u201cThe MSIC has made 12,000 referrals to health and welfare services in order to assist and divert users, and has reduced the ambulance callout rate by 80%, thus reducing the burden on the healthcare system.\u201d The inquiry has also heard from a number of health and legal authorities calling for decriminalisation and pointing to the failure of law enforcement efforts to curb illicit drug addiction. In its submission, the NSW Bar Association did not support the decriminalisation of production, trafficking and supply of illicit drugs, but said it believed \u201cconsideration should be given to decriminalisation of personal acquisition, possession and use of illicit drugs, with increased focus on treatment and harm-reduction measures\u201d. The association argued that \u201ccriminalisation of personal drug use may result in greater harm to the individual, and to society more broadly\u201d, and said there was \u201cno doubt\u201d that organised crime networks \u201crely on prohibition for their business model and profit margins\u201d. It called for NSW to adopt the approach taken in Portugal, where personal drug use was decriminalised in 2001, by using civil orders to deal with personal drug acquisition, possession and use. Such an approach, it said, \u201cwould alleviate the harms caused by the criminalisation of drug use, while facilitating a public health approach to the use of drugs\u201d. The inquiry\u2019s consideration of decriminalisation comes in the wake of an inquest held into opioid-related deaths in which the deputy state coroner Harriet Grahame called for a complete reframing of drug policy in the state and said the government should consider \u201cdecriminalising personal use of drugs, as a mechanism to reduce the harm caused by drug use\u201d. The inquiry is to report in October.",

Despite the highly anticipated meeting between the US and Chinese presidents on Saturday, the first since trade talks broke down in May, few expect a substantive agreement to end almost a year of trade tensions and months of deteriorating ties between the world\u2019s two largest economies. \u201cI think at best we could see a superficial agreement to halt further escalation of the trade war and an agreement to resume negotiations,\u201d said Scott Kennedy, a US-China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Ahead of the meeting, Trump has threatened to implement more tariffs on another round of Chinese goods, worth $300bn, including on everyday products used by US consumers like electronics. The standoff has rattled the world\u2019s financial markets amid nervousness about potential disruption of the international trade system and knock-on implications for global growth. Asian markets were down on Wednesday morning after US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell cast some doubt on expectations of a cut in interest rates. There have been signs the two sides want to restart talks. US and Chinese officials have spoken over the phone in the days leading up to the two-day summit, which begins on Friday in Japan, and US vice president Mike Pence delayed giving a critical speech on China. According to Japan\u2019s Asahi newspaper on Wednesday, the G20 leaders will call in a draft communique for the \u201cpromotion of free trade\u201d as a means to achieve strong global growth. The text also stressed the importance of creating a positive cycle where the benefits of solid growth are distributed broadly across economies, the Asahi said.

Senior US officials said this week that Trump\u2019s stance had not changed and that he was \u201cquite comfortable\u201d with the position of the administration at the moment, and with any outcome of the talks. Chinese state media have promised the country will \u201cfight to the end\u201d and have framed the trade war as an attempt by Washington to constrain China\u2019s development. Chinese vice commerce minister Wang Shouwen said on Monday: \u201cWe should meet each other halfway \u2026 both sides need to compromise and make concessions, not just one side,\u201d he said. \u201cMutual respect means each side must respect the other\u2019s sovereignty.\u201d The official People\u2019s Daily said in an editorial this week: \u201cRetreating on any issue related to China\u2019s core interest means giving up the future of China\u2019s development.\u201d The trade talks come amid mass protests in Hong Kong over a controversial extradition bill, a topic Beijing has said will not be discussed at the summit.

Observers say that even if a trade agreement or truce is reached, the era of broader US-China rivalry and tension over politics, security, human rights, and business as well as trade, is only just beginning. \u201cTrade negotiations are a very thin slice of what is now a comprehensive and enduring strategic competition that will most certainly get worse before it gets better,\u201d said Jude Blanchette, senior adviser and China practice lead at the Crumpton Group, an advisory group in Washington. Ominous prospects of Middle East conflict also loom over the summit, after Iran shot down a US drone following accusations by Washington that it had attacked two tankers in the Gulf of Oman. A White House official said Trump would meet at least eight world leaders, including Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin, to win support for sanctions on Iran. Japans prime minister Shinzo Abe wants the G20 summit to focus on reforming the World Trade Organization, empowering female workers and reducing plastic rubbish in the ocean. As Trump prepared to leave for Japan, a White House official told Associated Press that the president\u2019s chief of protocol, Sean Lawler, was leaving the administration amid a probe of his management of staff. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity.",

      "bodyText": "Media executives have united to call on the government to amend a range of laws to protect journalists and whistleblowers after a series of widely condemned raids on media organisations by the Australian federal police. The country\u2019s three biggest media organisations \u2013 the ABC, News Corp and Nine \u2013 called for legislative and cultural change in an unprecedented show of unity at the National Press Club on Wednesday. The ABC managing director, David Anderson, who has asked the federal court to set aside the warrant that authorised the AFP raid earlier this month, was joined by the executive chairman of News Corp Australasia, Michael Miller, and the Nine chief executive, Hugh Marks. Marks said he was shocked to discover how laws had multiplied over the past few years to stifle the media, and he likened the process to a frog in boiling water. News Corp is also going to mount a legal challenge against the AFP raid on Annika Smethurst\u2019s home. Anderson told the press club that a free media must be \u201centrenched in law\u201d and journalism must be decriminalised. \u201cThe legacy is a patchwork of laws that make it difficult, sometimes impossible, for the media to do its public duty,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cJournalists are increasingly accused of crimes for performing their job. Whistleblowers, whose brave interventions are so important to identifying wrongdoing, run the risk of being cowed out of existence.\u201d The three men represent the views of Australia\u2019s Right to Know Coalition, which includes Guardian Australia, Australian Associated Press, the West Australian, Bauer Media, subscription and free-to-air television, community broadcasting, the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance and commercial radio. The media executives handed out a six-point plan that includes a review of defamation law, protections for public-sector whistleblowers, a stronger freedom of information scheme and a new regime that limits which documents can be stamped secret. The media is also calling for journalists to be exempted from tough new national security laws in the name of public interest reporting and for all warrants to be contestable. The AFP raided the broadcaster earlier this month over a 2017 report into the clandestine operations of Australian special forces in Afghanistan just one day after the AFP raided the home of a News Corp political editor over articles she published in 2018 on proposals to expand Australia\u2019s domestic surveillance capabilities. \u201cAs a society, we shouldn\u2019t fear truth,\u201d Marks told the press club. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t fear debate.

The CEO of the MEAA, Paul Murphy, added the media union\u2019s voice to the call to stop laws stifling public interest journalism. \u201cThe raids by the AFP earlier this month have highlighted just how vulnerable press freedom is in Australia,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThose raids were not justified on national security grounds and were intended to identify the sources of leaks which have embarrassed the government and the defence establishment.\u201d The media organisations want: \u2022 The right to contest any kind of search warrant on journalists or news organisations before the warrant is issued \u2022 Public-sector whistleblowers to be adequately protected with current laws to be changed \u2022 A new regime that limits which documents can be stamped \u201csecret\u201d \u2022 A proper review of freedom of information laws \u2022 Journalists to be exempted from the national security laws enacted over the past seven years that can put them in jail for just doing their jobs",

      "bodyText": "A company that sold fake Aboriginal art has been fined $2.3m for \u201cfalse and misleading conduct\u201d, the largest penalty of its kind awarded by the federal court. Birubi Art breached consumer law by selling thousands of Indonesian-made items as Aboriginal art, but is unlikely to ever have to pay the fine because the company is in liquidation. In October, the federal court found that Birubi Art had \u201cmade false or misleading representations that products it sold were made in Australia and hand-painted by Australian Aboriginal persons, in breach of the Australian consumer law\u201d. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) sought a high penalty to act as a deterrent, and to signify the \u201cserious cultural harm\u201d done by fake Aboriginal art. These harms were \u201cgrave and far-reaching\u201d and involved \u201cnot just direct economic loss but a weakening of the value of the authentic products\u201d and an \u201cerosion of consumer confidence in the entire sector\u201d. Outside the court, the CEO of the Indigenous Art Code, Gabrielle Sullivan, said the judgment was \u201cpromising and it will hopefully act as a deterrent for others\u201d but \u201cit is important to acknowledge that the law has not changed\u201d. The Indigenous Art code is set up to promote and preserve ethical trading in Indigenous art. \u201cThe existing consumer law has been used to highlight misleading and deceptive conduct,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cWhile the ACCC acknowledges the cultural harm caused, it must be made clear that Birubi, in liquidation, were not on trial for abuses of Indigenous cultural and intellectual property and stealing, and cultural theft.\u201d Birubi Art went into voluntary liquidation in 2017 but not before selling its assets to another company, Gifts Mate, \u201cestablished and controlled by Birubi\u2019s former director Mr [Ben] Wooster,\u201d federal court judge Melissa Parry noted in her decision. \u201cWhat\u2019s not clear is how the law deals with the fact that Gifts Mate Australia continue to sell works which are strikingly similar to the products Birubi has previously sold,\u201d Sullivan said. The Indigenous Art Code and other organisations are now calling for tougher laws to protect against misrepresentation and fake art. \u201cThere is no law in Australia that says you can\u2019t make fake art or you can\u2019t misappropriate Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture. All the law says is that if you are doing that you need to be up front about it,\u201d Sullivan said. Between July 2015 and November 2017, the ACCC said, Birubi sold more than 18,000 boomerangs, bullroarers, didgeridoos and message stones to retail outlets around Australia, featuring designs \u201cassociated with Australian Aboriginal art\u201d and labelled with words such as \u201cAboriginal Art\u201d, \u201cgenuine\u201d and \u201cAustralia\u201d. Up to 80% of Aboriginal souvenir products sold are fake or have not been made under a fair and transparent licensing agreement, the Australian copyright agency, the Indigenous Art Code and Arts Law said, in a joint statement following today\u2019s judgment. \u201cFake art deprives Indigenous artists of economic opportunity and demeans Indigenous cultural heritage. \u201cThese concerns cannot be overcome through the existing consumer protection laws on false and misleading representations. \u201cA new law enforced by the ACCC to prevent the sale of fake art is needed.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Australia is so far taking a watch and wait approach on ratcheting tensions between the US and Iran, with the trade minister, Simon Birmingham, pleading for calm. With presidents Donald Trump and Hassan Rouhani escalating their rhetoric against each other, traditional US allies have expressed concerns about entering \u201can accidental war\u201d. In the last 24 hours, Trump threatened Iran with \u201cobliteration\u201d while Rouhani labelled the US leader as suffering from a mental disorder. The British foreign minister and prime ministerial hopeful, Jeremy Hunt, told the House of Commons he did not anticipate the UK joining any military action, saying the Foreign Office was very concerned about the \u201crisks of an accidental war\u201d. \u201cThe US is our closest ally \u2013 we talk to them the whole time, we consider any requests that they say carefully \u2013 but I cannot envisage any situation where they request or we agree to any moves to go to war,\u201d Hunt said. Like North Korea, Iran is expected to be a key topic of conversations between leaders at the Group of 20 in Japan this week, where Scott Morrison will meet Trump. But while Australia was keeping a keen eye on the situation, Birmingham said, no decisions about future action \u2013 sanctions or otherwise \u2013 had yet been made. \u201cWe have serious concerns around Iran\u2019s destabilising behaviour,\u201d Birmingham told ABC radio on Wednesday. \u201cWe urge calm from the Iranians in their response to at what at present are purely economic sanctions. \u201cBut economic sanctions designed to influence the behaviour of a state to prevent them from the escalation of development of nuclear technologies, and military activities and terrorism activities that could well undermine the peace and prosperity of the rest of the world.\u201d Australia maintains the sanctions the UN security council placed on Iran, as well as autonomous sanctions around goods and services, including arms and some metals. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In May 2018 the US reinstated all previous sanctions it had placed on Iran after Trump withdrew the US from the joint comprehensive plan of action set up under the Obama administration. Birmingham said Australia continued to review its sanctions. Labor\u2019s deputy leader, Richard Marles, said he believed any move by Australia would \u201chave to be considered very carefully\u201d but he shared Birmingham\u2019s concerns about Iran and destabilisation in the region. \u201cIn terms of the rhetoric, I think we\u2019ve seen this before and I tend to judge based on actions, rather than words what\u2019s going on with the American administration,\u201d he told the ABC. \u201cObviously this rhetoric is concerning \u2013 but the actions of Iran have been concerning.

This, coupled with the return of deportees with criminal convictions to Pacific countries from Australia, New Zealand and the United States without community links, languages or cultural knowledge, who often turn to crime, has further entrenched crime in the region.

If we don\u2019t do this, not only are we not being very good neighbours, it also shows that, despite the rhetoric of the Australian \u201cstep-up\u201d and the New Zealand Pacific \u201creset\u201d, governments in Canberra and Wellington are only interested in the Pacific region as it impacts their interests and national security.

Read more below about the image and what it tells us about the reality at the US-Mexico border: The Justice Department filed a lawsuit against former White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman for allegedly failing to file a required financial disclosure report after she was fired, the Hill is reporting. Manigault Newman faces fines of up to $50,000. The former Apprentice reality show villain was fired from the Trump White House, where she held the position of director of communications for the office of public liaison, in December 2017. She went on to write a searing tell-all memoir about her time in the White House. Hey all, Vivian Ho taking over for Oliver Laughland. Happy Tuesday. I\u2019m handing over our live coverage of a relatively quiet day in Washington to my colleague Vivian Ho in San Francisco now. Donald Trump has presented Staff Sgt. David Bellavia with the medal of honor, marking the first time a living veteran of the Iraq war has received the American military\u2019s highest award for valour. The award was given to Staff Sgt. Bellavia for actions taken during Operation Iraqi Freedom during combat in November 2004. \u201cDavid often tells young people, Americans don\u2019t want to fight. But if someone picks a fight for us, we\u2019ll win. We fight for love of our country,\u201d the Trump told an audience at the White House. Following the short ceremony the president did not take questions from reporters. Some more comments from Trump\u2019s appearance today have come through from the pool report. They relate in particular to Iran. Q: \u201cDo you have an exit strategy for Iran, if war does break out?\u201d Trump: \u201cYou\u2019re not going to need an exit strategy. I don\u2019t do exit strategies.\u201d And from earlier: Q: \u201cWhat message did you want to send to [Iran]?\u201d Trump: \u201cThere is no message. You know what, I\u2019ll tell you what the message is: When they\u2019re ready ... let isn\u2019t know. When they\u2019re ready, they\u2019ll let us know.\u201d Q: \u201cReady to negotiate?\u201d Trump: \u201cReady to do whatever. Doesn\u2019t make a difference. Whatever they want to do, I\u2019m ready.\u201d President Trump has made his first public appearance of the day at an executive order signing at the White House. Trump was enacting an order related to affordable housing. The pool report is not yielding a huge amount in the way of full quotes, but here\u2019s what we have: The president said he is \u201cvery concerned\u201d about conditions in detention centres near the border, but argued they were in better shape than under President Obama. He says that John Sanders, the CBP commissioner was not asked to resign. He again called on Democrats to back asylum law changes. \u201cWe need the votes of Democrats,\u201d he said. He falsely told reporters that a wall on the southern border is \u201cheavily under construction\u201d. Trump said the US is ready for \u201cwhatever\u201d Iran wants to do. The president commended Stephanie Grishman on her new job as press secretary. Here\u2019s some reaction to reports that acting CBP commissioner John Sanders is set to resign. Amnesty International USA advocacy director Charanya Krishnaswami says: Children should never be held in detention at all, let alone in the appalling conditions that were detailed in reports this weekend from a Texas border patrol station. Today\u2019s announcement that the chief of Customs and Border Protection is resigning is an opportunity for steps to be taken, including Congressional hearings and investigations, to provide accountability for these shocking abuses, and compassionate care to children seeking safety in the United States. Any effort to normalize the warehousing of children is unacceptable. Here\u2019s how things stand at lunch time today: Donald Trump has threatened Iran with \u201coverwhelming force\u201d and \u201cobliteration\u201d if the regime attacks \u201canything American\u201d in a series of Tweets. The comments followed Iran\u2019s admonishment of the president\u2019s latest round of sanctions. Stephanie Grisham, Melania Trump\u2019s communications lead, has been named the new White House press secretary. Her new role is a sweeping one, she will continue in the East Wing and also become White House communications chief. The acting head of Customs and Border Protection, John Sanders, is set to resign amid ongoing outcry against the administration\u2019s treatment of children in detention. Multiple outlets are reporting that acting Customs and Border Protection (CBP) commissioner John Sanders is set to resign amid ongoing outcry over the treatment in immigration detention. Sanders has only been at CBP since July 2018 after joining the department from the private sector. Outlets are reporting he will leave his job as the administration\u2019s top immigration official on 5 July. CNN is reporting that Grisham\u2019s new role will be a vastly expanded job. She will continue as Melania Trump\u2019s communication lead, take over Sanders\u2019 job as White House press secretary and will also be the White House communications director, filling the job vacated by Bill Shine earlier in the year. The news outlet reports that Grisham, who came through the Republican party communication ranks in Arizona, will accompany Donald Trump on his trip to the G20 summit in Japan this week. Stephanie Grisham, currently the communications director for First Lady Melania Trump has been named as the White House press secretary, following the departure of Sarah Huckabee Sanders. It appears she will also continue on as the First Lady\u2019s communications lead as well. Jared Kushner has been speaking in Manama, Bahrain, where his much-touted but much-doubted \u201cpeace to prosperity\u201d plan for Israel and the Palestinian territories, which contains a $50bn development blueprint, is making its first steps in the world. According to wire updates from Reuters transmitted in rather breathless capital letters, the president\u2019s son-in-law and chief adviser said political issues would not be discussed at the two-day \u201ceconomic workshop\u201d in Bahrain, because a political solution to the decades-old conflict is not possible without economic progress for the Palestinians. He also reportedly said the Trump administration \u201chas not given up\u201d on the Palestinians. This will be greeted with skepticism among Palestinians, given the relentlessly pro-Israel slant of US policy under Trump. Before the Manama conference began, prime minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said: \u201cWe have realised that this economic workshop in Bahrain is going to be really nonsense. It is just simply a theoretical piece of work calling for $50bn.\u201d For further reading, here\u2019s Julian Borger\u2019s preview of the event, published this morning: My colleague Emily Holden has been following a protest action at Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington ahead of the primary debates tomorrow. She sends this note: The Sunrise Movement is calling on the party to allow a climate-focused debate. DNC chair Tom Perez has warned that any candidate who participates in one will be banned from other party debates. Destiney Lee, a 22-year-old from Dallas, Texas, and a fellow with the Sunrise Movement, said she is protesting for the party to consider climate change as more than a single issue, as Perez has referred to the crisis caused by rising temperatures. \u201cWhich side are you on now, which side are you on?\u201d the protestors sang from the steps of the headquarters. They held signs with the words \u201cClimate Debate,\u201d \u201cGreen New Deal Now,\u201d and \u201c11 years.\u201d Scientists have said the world has just over a decade to begin to rapidly shift away from burning fossil fuels and other activities that heat the planet. A pair of congressmen have unveiled a bipartisan measure to block President Trump taking military action against Iran without congressional approval. An amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act being proposed by proposed by Democrat Rohit Khanna and Republican Matt Gaetz, a Trump loyalist, would block funding for military action in Iran without congressional approval. \u201cLast week, we watched President Trump come within minutes of striking Iran and involving the United States in yet another trillion-dollar war in the Middle East,\u201d said a statement from Khanna. \u201cPresident Trump campaigned on ending costly wars overseas, but given the advisors he chose and his recent risky actions, he is not living up to that promise.\u201d \u201cThis amendment affirms what President Trump knows and believes: unfocused, unconstitutional, unending wars in the Middle East make America weaker, not stronger,\u201d said Gaetz, as reported by The Hill. \u201cIran must be prevented from obtaining a nuclear weapon and threatening international peace, but Congress must resolve to ensure that any military action is carried out constitutionally.\u201d Trump has suggested earlier in the week he does not believe he needs congressional approval to launch military action. A bit more context on those incendiary tweets just sent by the president on Iran. Trump threatened \u201coverwhelming force\u201d and \u201cobliteration\u201d should Iran attack \u201canything American\u201d. The tweets are a response to Tehran\u2019s overnight response to the administration\u2019s new round of sanctions following the Iranian military downing an unmanned drone it claimed had entered Iranian airspace last week. The new sanctions directly target Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and were announced at public signing at the White House yesterday. Overnight Iranian President Hassan Rouhani called the new sanctions \u201coutrageous and idiotic\u201d and suggested the administration was \u201cafflicted by mental retardation\u201d for imposing them. \u201cYou sanction the foreign minister simultaneously with a request for talks?\u201d he said according to reports. With the first round of Democratic presidential primary debates set to take place tomorrow, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, currently polling at between 0-1% has tried sharing some of his debate preparation with the public. We\u2019ll leave you to judge: The president has sent another string of combative tweets aimed at the Iranian regime after signing another round of sanctions earlier in the week. It\u2019s more of the same when it comes to thinly veiled threats of military action and criticism of the previous administration\u2019s efforts to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear threat. Donald Trump\u2019s agriculture secretary has acknowledged that farmers are bearing the brunt of the president\u2019s ongoing trade war. Sonny Perdue acknowledged in an interview with CNN that US farmers are \u201cone of the casualties here with trade disruption\u201d. He added: \u201cWe knew going in that when you flew the penalty flag on China, the retaliation, if it came, would be against the farmer.\u201d Agricultural workers have been hurt by the administration\u2019s ongoing trade war with China after Beijing imposed retaliatory tariffs that have particularly effected soybean, corn and wheat growers in the US. The Trump administration has pledged $28 billion in aid to those affected by the tariffs. Here\u2019s a bit of reaction to last night\u2019s CNN interview and Trump\u2019s comments earlier on Monday. As is expected these days, they mostly split along partisan lines. From the president\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr: From former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld who is attempting to wrest the Republican presidential nomination from Trump: And an observation from CNN\u2019s media editor that the allegations have attracted little coverage from the Trump favouring Fox News network. Here\u2019s some more of E Jean Carroll\u2019s comments on CNN last night. The advice columnist was appearing on Anderson Cooper\u2019s show after Trump doubled down on his denial of her allegations earlier in the day. In an interview with The Hill, Trump said: \u201cI\u2019ll say it with great respect: Number one, she\u2019s not my type. Number two, it never happened. It never happened, OK?\u201d 16 women have publicly accused the president of sexual misconduct and assault. On Monday evening Carroll told CNN that Trump\u2019s most recent denial followed a pattern. \u201cHe denies, he turns it around, he threatens and he attacks,\u201d she said. She went on to describe the attack in the mid 1990s at a Manhattan department store. She said there were no attendants in the changing room area at the time of the alleged incident and she did not file a report to the police. \u201cI wanted to forget it,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought A, my fault. B, I was stupid. C, I didn\u2019t think of it ... as rape. I thought of it as a violent incident. I thought of it as a fight,\u201d she said. The full interview is here. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of politics today in the US. Here\u2019s what\u2019s coming up. Last night the woman accusing Donald Trump of sexual assaulting her in the 1990s responded to Trump\u2019s denial and suggestion she was \u201cnot my type\u201d. Speaking on CNN the celebrated advice columnist E. Jean Carroll said: \u201cI love that, I am so glad I am not his type. I\u2019m so glad.\u201d Trump is scheduled to host a conference call with 10,000 US veterans to update them on progress since his the Mission Act, legislation that increases private healthcare protection for veterans. The roll out of the legislation had been criticized by a number of veterans\u2019 groups in recent weeks. A number of Democratic candidates for president are out on the road in Florida ahead of the first round of debates tomorrow. My colleague David Smith will be following Beto O\u2019Rourke and Elizabeth Warren in Miami. The president\u2019s son-in-law and advisor Jared Kushner will lead the administration in a conference in Bahrian focused on peace in the Middle East. He will discuss the economic chapter of his controversial peace plan. We\u2019ll bring you live updates as they happen.",
