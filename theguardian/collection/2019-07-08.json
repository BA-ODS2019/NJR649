      "bodyText": "The Australian federal police has revealed it accessed the metadata of journalists 58 times in the 2017-18 financial year. The admission came in a submission to the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security\u2019s review of the mandatory data retention law, which has been in place since 2015. Under the legislation, call records, IP addresses and other so-called metadata is held by telecommunications companies for two years. Agencies including the AFP don\u2019t need a warrant to access the vast bulk of the metadata collected for investigations but, if seeking the metadata of a journalist, they must get a journalist information warrant signed off by an issuing authority appointed by the government. The AFP told the committee that in the 2017-18 financial year, it had obtained two journalist information warrants that led to journalists\u2019 metadata being accessed 58 times. In total, the AFP said, it had accessed metadata close to 20,000 times in the same financial year. The information on the number of times metadata is accessed by government agencies is supposed to be released in total in an annual report on the operation of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act, but it has been close to two years since the release of the last report, covering the 2016-17 financial year. The same committee is now examining the impact of the use of national security laws such as the mandatory data retention legislation on freedom of the press in the wake of the AFP raids on the ABC and the home of the News Corp journalist Annika Smethurst over leaks related to national security and defence matters. A cybersecurity researcher told the committee, which is also reviewing anti-encryption legislation, that the effect of the new law could even allow law enforcement to bypass the journalist information warrant scheme to hunt a journalist\u2019s sources. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Western Australian police force, on the other hand, has revealed it had difficulty obtaining a journalist information warrant owing to a public interest advocate not being based in the state. The PIA is appointed by the government to argue the case for the journalist whose metadata could be accessed. The journalist is never informed that their metadata could be accessed. The WA police, which obtained journalist information warrants in 2017, told the committee that it needed to go to South Australia to find a PIA and this had resulted in costs and delays for the investigation. WA police acting commissioner, Col Blanch, also complained that advances in technology such as encryption and the pending arrival of 5G made it more difficult for law enforcement to obtain metadata because call records and other such information was not being recorded as people move away from traditional calling and texting. He said Visitor Location Register \u2013 a database of the locations of mobile subscribers \u2013 was not within the scope of the act, and therefore Telstra does not hand it over.

Sales of TVs, garden furniture and barbecues were all down, with fewer impulse purchases being made. Overall, the picture is bleak: rising real wages have failed to translate into higher spending as ongoing Brexit uncertainty led consumers to put off non-essential purchases.</p> <p>\u201cBusinesses and the public desperately need clarity on Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU. The continued risk of a no-deal Brexit is harming consumer confidence and forcing retailers to spend hundreds of millions of pounds putting in place mitigations \u2013 this represents time and resources that would be better spent improving customer experience and prices. It is vital that the next prime minister can find a solution that avoids a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, just before the busy Black Friday and Christmas periods.\u201d</p> <p>The BRC report showed that the problems of the retail sector were concentrated among non-food stores, which were down 4.3% over the latest three months and by 2.8% annually.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Consumers are increasingly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/07/almost-90-of-uk-shoppers-use-amazon-research-reveals\">shopping online</a>, with BRC data showing that more than 30% of non-food items were bought over the internet. The digital penetration rate rose from 28.5% to 30.7% between June 2018 and June 2019.</p> <p>Paul Martin, KPMG\u2019s UK head of retail, said: \u201cThere are few places retailers can hide from the difficult trading conditions that have been hitting the industry for some time.

      "bodyText": "Fears that Britain\u2019s economy has come to a standstill have been heightened by a report from retailers showing annual consumer spending at its weakest since their records began in the mid-1990s. The British Retail Consortium said clarity over Brexit was urgently required after falling sales in June came as a marked contrast to the bumper World Cup and weather-related activity of a year earlier. In its monthly health check of the sector conducted with the consultancy firm KPMG, the BRC said total sales fell by 1.3% last month while the annual rate of growth slowed to 0.6%. Both were the weakest since the survey was launched in 1995 and add to the evidence that consumers \u2013 up until now the mainstay of growth \u2013 have started to spend less freely despite an increase in disposable income caused by earnings growing faster than inflation. The Office for National Statistics is expected to report that the economy moved sideways between April and May when it provides its latest update on Wednesday. Helen Dickinson, the BRC\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cJune sales could not compete with last year\u2019s scorching weather and World Cup, leading to the worst June on record. Sales of TVs, garden furniture and barbecues were all down, with fewer impulse purchases being made. Overall, the picture is bleak: rising real wages have failed to translate into higher spending as ongoing Brexit uncertainty led consumers to put off non-essential purchases. \u201cBusinesses and the public desperately need clarity on Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU. The continued risk of a no-deal Brexit is harming consumer confidence and forcing retailers to spend hundreds of millions of pounds putting in place mitigations \u2013 this represents time and resources that would be better spent improving customer experience and prices. It is vital that the next prime minister can find a solution that avoids a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, just before the busy Black Friday and Christmas periods.\u201d The BRC report showed that the problems of the retail sector were concentrated among non-food stores, which were down 4.3% over the latest three months and by 2.8% annually. Consumers are increasingly shopping online, with BRC data showing that more than 30% of non-food items were bought over the internet. The digital penetration rate rose from 28.5% to 30.7% between June 2018 and June 2019. Paul Martin, KPMG\u2019s UK head of retail, said: \u201cThere are few places retailers can hide from the difficult trading conditions that have been hitting the industry for some time. June\u2019s retail performance did little to ease that, with like-for-like sales falling 1.6% compared to last year. \u201cPressure on retailers continues to mount and is seemingly coming from all angles: economic, geopolitical, environmental and behavioural. Consumer spend is only likely to fall further as things stand and cost efficiency remains vital. The focus for most in the industry will be preservation and adaptation in order to see them through these tough times.\u201d",

Last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/26/bathstore-goes-into-administration-putting-over-500-jobs-at-risk\">Bathstore</a> became the latest of a string of high street retailers to go into administration under pressure from growing competition online.</p> <p>Landlords are being asked to slash rents and the government urged to take action on business rates, which are based on property and so hinder retailers with a physical presence. The British Retail Consortium says retail conditions are the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/04/retailers-warn-of-fresh-wave-of-job-losses-and-store-closures\">toughest in a decade</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe industry is undergoing a painful readjustment period,\u201d Lim said. \u201cThe acceleration of further store closures will eventually lead to a more \u2018inconvenient\u2019 experience for some groups of consumers across many parts of the UK. Inevitably, this frustration will be a catalyst for further online shopping with consumers turning to online as an alternative to in-store purchases.\u201d </p> <p>The differing behaviour of younger generations poses particular threats for certain kinds of shop. People aged between 25 and 44 are far more likely to buy clothing, books, electrical goods or food online than those over 55, for example, according to the research.</p> <p>But it may not all be plain sailing for online businesses. The research also found that people were increasingly questioning whether they benefited from giving corporate entities access to their personal information. More than a quarter of respondents said they had taken some action to limit the amount of data shared with companies, rising to almost a third among 16- to 24-year-olds.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Online shopping could more than double its share of the retail market by 2028, according to a report that spells further difficulties for landlords, stores and communities. The internet is expected to account for 53% of retail sales in 10 years\u2019 time, up from about a fifth at present, as younger people who have grown up with the internet become more than half the UK\u2019s adult population, according to a report by the analysts Retail Economics for the law firm Womble Bond Dickinson. One in 10 people of all ages questioned for the report said they planned to shop more online in the year ahead. Richard Lim, of Retail Economics, said: \u201cSuccessful retailers have always had to reinvent themselves to stay relevant. However, the pace of change will inevitably prove too fast for many. It definitely feels like the digital retail revolution is only just getting started.\u201d Lim predicts that new and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence that could enable the automation of delivery and personalised marketing will drive future online growth. The research is likely to fuel calls for action to protect communities and help to reinvent town centres after a wave of store closures. Debenhams, Marks &amp; Spencer and the Topshop owner Arcadia have all announced plans to close stores in the year ahead. Last month Bathstore became the latest of a string of high street retailers to go into administration under pressure from growing competition online. Landlords are being asked to slash rents and the government urged to take action on business rates, which are based on property and so hinder retailers with a physical presence. The British Retail Consortium says retail conditions are the toughest in a decade. \u201cThe industry is undergoing a painful readjustment period,\u201d Lim said. \u201cThe acceleration of further store closures will eventually lead to a more \u2018inconvenient\u2019 experience for some groups of consumers across many parts of the UK. Inevitably, this frustration will be a catalyst for further online shopping with consumers turning to online as an alternative to in-store purchases.\u201d The differing behaviour of younger generations poses particular threats for certain kinds of shop. People aged between 25 and 44 are far more likely to buy clothing, books, electrical goods or food online than those over 55, for example, according to the research. But it may not all be plain sailing for online businesses. The research also found that people were increasingly questioning whether they benefited from giving corporate entities access to their personal information. More than a quarter of respondents said they had taken some action to limit the amount of data shared with companies, rising to almost a third among 16- to 24-year-olds.",

      "bodyText": "Children who have grown up in Britain are being deprived of their right to citizenship because of the \u201cheavy-handed\u201d approach taken by immigration officials, a parliamentary committee has said. The \u201cgood character\u201d test is being applied so strictly that it is even affecting youngsters who have no criminal convictions, according to the joint committee on human rights (JCHR). The committee\u2019s report, which scrutinises the government\u2019s proposed changes to the British Nationality Act 1981, raises concerns about immigration control practices. A police caution or minor offence could mean that a child who has grown up in the UK may be denied British citizenship, the MPs and peers warned. The study follows a report in the Guardian last year based on freedom of information requests, which found that on average one child a week has had their application rejected over the last five years. Campaigners estimated that as many as 400 children had been denied citizenship for failing to satisfy the good character requirement since it was introduced in 2006. The committee investigation noted that during the past decade \u201cgood character requirements have been extended to apply to children who are entitled to be British citizens due to their close connection with the UK\u201d. The report said: \u201cIt is inappropriate to apply the good character requirement to young children with a right to be British, where the United Kingdom is the only country they know and where they have grown up their whole lives here.\u201d Evidence heard by the committee showed that good character tests affected children as young as 10 who had lived all their lives in the UK. MPs and peers were also critical of the high fees charged for applications, which can cost up to four figures. \u201cThis means the government is asking children for fees that are more than three times the cost recovery for processing such an application,\u201d the committee said. \u201cThe committee is concerned that disproportionately high fees could risk excluding children from more vulnerable socio-economic backgrounds from accessing their rights.\u201d The Home Office is urged to review its proposed changes to the law and act \u201cwithout delay\u201d to ensure a fair, non-discriminatory approach to UK nationality law. \u201cThe application of good character requirements to children raises concerns that the rights of the child \u2013 and in particular the requirement that the best interests of the child be a primary consideration \u2013 are not being respected in the application of nationality law to children living in the UK,\u201d the study said. Cuts to legal aid have compounded the problem. \u201cIt is now harder than ever for individuals to obtain the advice they need to be able to access justice and enforce their human rights,\u201d the committee concluded. \u201cThis can be all the more important relating to citizenship rights as these touch upon the very identity of a person and their rights to live in the country where they were born, have grown up and with which they identify and have their cultural links and identity.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The fire brigade has warned four NHS trusts that they plan to shut down parts of their hospitals because they are so decrepit that they pose a threat to patients and staff. Fire chiefs have made plain to the trusts that they must make urgent improvements to the units concerned in order to improve safety or face legal action to close them down. The Care Quality Commission, the watchdog that inspects hospitals and GP surgeries, is also considering using its powers because it fears infrastructure problems risk affecting patients. Management at the four trusts are worried about the disruption to services if the fire brigades follow through on their warnings. They blame multibillion-pound government raids on the NHS\u2019s capital budget in recent years for creating a situation where they have been left without the money to fix worsening problems with hospital buildings such as broken lifts and leaks of water and sewage. Capital funding is used to repair NHS facilities, buy new equipment and build premises. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents trusts in England, warned that the problem was now so great that patients\u2019 safety was at risk. He was unwilling to identify the four trusts, but said: \u201cA number of trusts have told me that they are worried they are running an unacceptable fire hazard risk and several have said they don\u2019t have the capital to comply with the terms of formal Care Quality Commission enforcement notices. \u201cOver many years of austerity, trusts have had to hold back from buying new scanners, replacing ageing wards, repairing leaking roofs and purchasing new ambulances. They\u2019ve scrimped, saved, patched up and made do, but we\u2019ve now reached a crisis point.\u201d In the past year, one trust has suffered multiple floods because of crumbling pipework, another has had to close its intensive care unit because water was running down its walls, and a third cancelled appointments for cancer diagnosis because its ageing scanner broke down. The overall bill facing the NHS in England to tackle its backlog of maintenance shot up from \u00a35.5bn in 2016-17 to almost \u00a36bn in 2017-18, including \u00a33bn needed to tackle problems that involve a \u201chigh\u201d or \u201csignificant\u201d risk, of which more than \u00a31bn are problems posing a high risk. Trust bosses have become increasingly frustrated about ministers diverting money from the NHS capital budget to help pay for its day-to-day running costs. NHS England has told them to spend 20% less than they planned on capital projects this year in order to help Matt Hancock\u2019s Department of Health and Social Care stick to its departmental spending limit. Senior staff at the trusts privately say the order is \u201cludicrous\u201d and is stopping NHS organisations that do have enough capital funding set aside to spend on projects that are now urgent, including fire risks. The Epsom and St Helier NHS trust in Surrey calculated last year that it needed to spend \u00a393m to urgently prevent the increasingly archaic facilities at its two hospitals from becoming so out of date that they presented a threat to the smooth running of its services. The CQC is understood to have told the trust that it will take enforcement action against its intensive care unit unless it urgently addresses problems identified more than a year ago, which have not been tackled because it does not have the \u00a33m needed to cover the cost. Prof John Appleby, an expert in NHS finances at the Nuffield Trust health thinktank, said ministers transferred \u00a34.3bn from the service\u2019s capital budget to its revenue budget between 2013-14 and 2018-19. \u201cWe\u2019ve now had many years of the NHS investment pot being siphoned off just to keep day-to-day services running and the problems are multiplying,\u201d he said. \u201cMaintenance gets put off or skimped on, leaving a rising backlog of leaky roofs, broken lifts and worse.

      "body": "<p>Nursing, says Stephen Jones, is a brilliant career: loads of job satisfaction, a not-bad salary, and plenty of scope for specialising and for work progression. He qualified in 2014, and he\u2019s now a staff nurse for Oxleas NHS trust in south London. \u201cWhen my mum, who\u2019s also a nurse, suggested it might be what I\u2019d like to do I did initially have all these stereotyped thoughts about nursing being for women,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m so glad I got over that, because it ticks all the boxes for what I want to do with my life.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s probably never been a better time to be a nurse, with so many potential directions and opportunities. And, says Wendy Preston, head of nursing practice at the Royal College of Nursing, it\u2019s such a diverse career, and the NHS needs a nursing population that reflects society. But one of the hardest areas to get <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/24/nhs-breakthrough-more-men-study-nursing\">parity</a>, traditionally, has been from a gender perspective: because only around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2017/mar/01/why-so-few-male-nurses\" title=\"\">one in </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2017/mar/01/why-so-few-male-nurses\" title=\"\">10 nurses in Britain is male</a>. Earlier this year there was a report that the number of men applying was on the up, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/24/nhs-breakthrough-more-men-study-nursing?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\" title=\"\">a 9% increase in university applications</a>; and those responsible for recruiting nurses are acutely aware of the need to attract more men.</p> <p>In Scotland, the ambition is to have a 25:75 male:female split in nursing by 2030.

What it comes down to is patient choice: we are all patients, at some point in our lives, and we have the right to a choice about who cares for us. \u201cIf you\u2019re a man and you need personal care, you might prefer to have it from a male nurse, just as there are women who\u2019d prefer to have a female nurse,\u201d says Wood. What\u2019s more, he says, opening up nursing to men will have the knock-on effect of boosting numbers generally \u2013 and that\u2019s much-needed. \u201cWe have a shortage of nurses across the board, so encouraging more men into the profession helps on that front too,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c12717b5203ed259acaa10eee52b65cb36031b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c12717b5203ed259acaa10eee52b65cb36031b4/0_29_509_305/500.jpg\" alt=\"lecture\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ucas reported that 9% more men applied for nursing degrees, year on year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danil Rudenko/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>How nursing is changing</h2> <p>Think a nurse\u2019s job is all about mopping brows and changing bedpans?

      "bodyText": "Nursing, says Stephen Jones, is a brilliant career: loads of job satisfaction, a not-bad salary, and plenty of scope for specialising and for work progression. He qualified in 2014, and he\u2019s now a staff nurse for Oxleas NHS trust in south London. \u201cWhen my mum, who\u2019s also a nurse, suggested it might be what I\u2019d like to do I did initially have all these stereotyped thoughts about nursing being for women,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m so glad I got over that, because it ticks all the boxes for what I want to do with my life.\u201d There\u2019s probably never been a better time to be a nurse, with so many potential directions and opportunities. And, says Wendy Preston, head of nursing practice at the Royal College of Nursing, it\u2019s such a diverse career, and the NHS needs a nursing population that reflects society. But one of the hardest areas to get parity, traditionally, has been from a gender perspective: because only around one in 10 nurses in Britain is male. Earlier this year there was a report that the number of men applying was on the up, with a 9% increase in university applications; and those responsible for recruiting nurses are acutely aware of the need to attract more men. In Scotland, the ambition is to have a 25:75 male:female split in nursing by 2030.

If you want turn your love of books into a career, here\u2019s an expert guide.</p> <p><strong>Find the routes in<br></strong>Many publishers offer paid traineeships, graduate schemes or internship opportunities, which are often publicised on their social media channels.</p> <p>Georgina Ugen is a new starter in the industry who didn\u2019t take a traditional path. She has a degree in dance and cultural studies and was a property manager before applying to the HarperCollins\u2019 BAME traineeship scheme two years ago. She was offered the role of digital sales assistant and has since been promoted to digital sales manager.</p> <p>\u201cI found out about the BAME traineeship at HarperCollins through LinkedIn,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t get one of the two places on offer but was asked to apply for an entry level role, which I got. If you don\u2019t succeed at first, take the opportunity to make contacts.\u201d</p> <p>When you do see a role advertised don\u2019t be put off by the job description, Elizabeth Briggs, editor and marketing manager at Saqi Books, advises. \u201cNever be disheartened if you see something on the job description you haven\u2019t done yet. What experience do you have that might make you stand out? It can be something from your personal life, particularly at entry level,\u201d she says.</p> <p><strong>Network and do your research<br></strong>Not up to speed on what\u2019s going on in the publishing world? Ruth Howells, the Publishers Association\u2019s deputy director of external affairs, has these words of advice for you: \u201cResearch, research, research.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGo into bookshops and see how products are marketed and displayed. Find opportunities to network at relevant careers events or industry insight days,\u201d Howells says. Engaging with publishers on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram can be a good way to make connections. \u201cDon\u2019t jump in asking for a job, join in conversations on books and authors,\u201d says Ugen.</p> <p>Joining the <a href=\"https://thesyp.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Society of Young Publishers</a>, which supports people trying to get into publishing, is another starting point.</p> <p><strong>Consider different areas of publishing<br></strong>Editorial jobs tend to be in high demand, but publishing spans lots of areas, including legal, production, marketing and audio. Decide what sort of job you want and what type of publisher you want to work for, be it consumer, academic or education.</p> <p>Job roles are varied, from developers and rights analysts to commissioning editors. \u201cAll areas of the industry are looking for a range of different skills,\u201d says Howells.</p> <p>Specialising in a particular subject can help, depending on the role you\u2019re going for. \u201cSTM [science, technical and medical] graduates will have an advantage if they are applying for a STM publisher,\u201d says Eloise Cook, publisher for trade, consumer and professional business at Pearson.</p> <p>No matter what area you go into, a genuine love for books is a key requirement. John Athanasiou, director of people at HarperCollins UK, says: \u201cWhat we really want to see is a passion for the industry.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Experience: \u2018I still get excited when a manuscript is handed to me\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>What\u2019s it like to work in publishing? An award-winning creative director and junior designer reveal all. Interviews by Anne Cassidy</em></p> <p>Think of publishing and you may imagine the author is everything, but the industry is made up of many more roles. One is that of book design. Here we discover life as a junior designer and meet the creative director who mentors her.</p> <p><strong>Suzanne Dean<br></strong><em>Creative director, Vintage</em></p> <p>Styling a mannequin with the help of Ian McEwan is one of the more surreal tasks Suzanne Dean has undertaken as part of her job. Dean is the creative director at Vintage, an imprint of Penguin Random House, and has designed book covers for some of the world\u2019s bestselling authors, including McEwan, Julian Barnes, Haruki Murakami and Margaret Atwood.</p> <p>For McEwan\u2019s latest novel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/22/machines-like-us-ian-mcewan-review\" title=\"\">Machines Like Me</a>, Dean trawled through a factory of mannequins to find a suitable one to represent Adam, the robot at the centre of the story. She invited McEwan to help her oversee how the mannequin\u2019s face should be painted and its wig styled for the cover image.</p> <p>Her unconventional and experimental designs are likely to inspire a double-take. Her cover for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/31/the-largesse-of-the-sea-maiden-by-denis-johnson-review\" title=\"\">The Largesse of the Sea Maiden</a> by Denis Johnson involved intricately piecing together hundreds of pencil shavings so that they would resemble waves. \u201cThe best part of designing a cover is when you get a tingling buzz of recognition \u2013 you know when you\u2019ve cracked the idea,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Dean started out designing food packaging after studying graphic design at university. She found her calling when she got her first job designing covers at Penguin. \u201cAll these years later I still love this freedom. I still get excited when a manuscript is handed to me.\u201d</p> <p>To help come up with an image, she creates a mood board. \u201cThe mood board can sometimes be so big it covers the wall of my office,\u201d she says. Lines from the novel can inspire the design, as with her cover for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/04/the-only-story-review-julian-barnes\" title=\"\">Julian Barnes\u2019 The Only Story</a>. \u201cOne phrase, particularly, stood out. \u2018It is better to have loved and lost then never to have loved at all\u2019 is crossed out, only to be rewritten by [the narrator] Paul. I developed this idea.\u201d</p> <p>Dean says book design is having a renaissance. \u201cSocial media has made it a desirable area for young designers, you only need to look at all the book blogs and Instagram.\u201d She advises designers wanting to get into the trade to be willing to experiment. \u201cI\u2019d suggest they get a portfolio together that includes their own version of books they\u2019ve read and enter competitions like the Penguin Random House student design award.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Sophie Harris<br></strong><em>Junior designer, Vintage</em></p> <p>Long before she got into publishing, Sophie Harris was captivated by book covers. \u201cI\u2019ve always been fascinated by how you can distil a whole book into one single image,\u201d she says.</p> <p>This fascination led her to her dream job three years ago at Vintage, the Penguin Random House imprint, as a junior designer on creative director Suzanne Dean\u2019s team.</p> <p>Harris is currently working on the covers for four soon-to-be reissued Margaret Atwood titles: Bluebeard\u2019s Egg, Dancing Girls, Life Before Man and Bodily Harm, with the illustrator Celia Jacobs. \u201cThe best part [of the job] is feeling like you\u2019ve done a service to the author and the story, and created something sensitive and considered that excites people,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Harris, who is 26, studied graphic design while at university and got her first experience of book cover design during an Erasmus placement in Germany which offered a module in the subject. During the course, she got the chance to work on real briefs that had been submitted by commercial publishers. One of her cover designs \u2013 for the book Ich Wollte Einh\u00f6rner by Alina Simone \u2013 was chosen and published. After university, she interned at a few graphic design agencies and then spotted a job opportunity at Vintage. \u201cIn my mind I always wanted to be a book cover designer,\u201d she said. \u201cThen the job [at Vintage] came up. I\u2019ve never looked back.\u201d</p> <p>Harris\u2019 first high profile cover design at Vintage was How To Stop Brexit by Nick Clegg. She has since designed covers for other notable titles, including Our Rainbow Queen by Sali Hughes and Invisible Women by Caroline Criado Perez. \u201cInvisible Women is a really important book so I knew it would be a challenge for me,\u201d says Harris. \u201cWhen it became a top 10 bestseller it was a big moment.\u201d</p> <p>Harris advises anyone wanting to get into book design not to be put off if they feel they lack experience or haven\u2019t got the right contacts. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anyone in publishing,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat mattered most was that I had ideas and I was enthusiastic.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Download our <a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/07/05/Early_Careers_fullset_smaller.pdf\">career starter</a> supplement (pdf)</p></li> </ul>",

If you want turn your love of books into a career, here\u2019s an expert guide. Find the routes in Many publishers offer paid traineeships, graduate schemes or internship opportunities, which are often publicised on their social media channels. Georgina Ugen is a new starter in the industry who didn\u2019t take a traditional path. She has a degree in dance and cultural studies and was a property manager before applying to the HarperCollins\u2019 BAME traineeship scheme two years ago. She was offered the role of digital sales assistant and has since been promoted to digital sales manager. \u201cI found out about the BAME traineeship at HarperCollins through LinkedIn,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t get one of the two places on offer but was asked to apply for an entry level role, which I got. If you don\u2019t succeed at first, take the opportunity to make contacts.\u201d When you do see a role advertised don\u2019t be put off by the job description, Elizabeth Briggs, editor and marketing manager at Saqi Books, advises. \u201cNever be disheartened if you see something on the job description you haven\u2019t done yet. What experience do you have that might make you stand out? It can be something from your personal life, particularly at entry level,\u201d she says. Network and do your research Not up to speed on what\u2019s going on in the publishing world? Ruth Howells, the Publishers Association\u2019s deputy director of external affairs, has these words of advice for you: \u201cResearch, research, research.\u201d \u201cGo into bookshops and see how products are marketed and displayed. Find opportunities to network at relevant careers events or industry insight days,\u201d Howells says. Engaging with publishers on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram can be a good way to make connections. \u201cDon\u2019t jump in asking for a job, join in conversations on books and authors,\u201d says Ugen. Joining the Society of Young Publishers, which supports people trying to get into publishing, is another starting point. Consider different areas of publishing Editorial jobs tend to be in high demand, but publishing spans lots of areas, including legal, production, marketing and audio. Decide what sort of job you want and what type of publisher you want to work for, be it consumer, academic or education. Job roles are varied, from developers and rights analysts to commissioning editors. \u201cAll areas of the industry are looking for a range of different skills,\u201d says Howells. Specialising in a particular subject can help, depending on the role you\u2019re going for. \u201cSTM [science, technical and medical] graduates will have an advantage if they are applying for a STM publisher,\u201d says Eloise Cook, publisher for trade, consumer and professional business at Pearson. No matter what area you go into, a genuine love for books is a key requirement. John Athanasiou, director of people at HarperCollins UK, says: \u201cWhat we really want to see is a passion for the industry.\u201d Experience: \u2018I still get excited when a manuscript is handed to me\u2019 What\u2019s it like to work in publishing? An award-winning creative director and junior designer reveal all. Interviews by Anne Cassidy Think of publishing and you may imagine the author is everything, but the industry is made up of many more roles. One is that of book design. Here we discover life as a junior designer and meet the creative director who mentors her. Suzanne Dean Creative director, Vintage Styling a mannequin with the help of Ian McEwan is one of the more surreal tasks Suzanne Dean has undertaken as part of her job. Dean is the creative director at Vintage, an imprint of Penguin Random House, and has designed book covers for some of the world\u2019s bestselling authors, including McEwan, Julian Barnes, Haruki Murakami and Margaret Atwood. For McEwan\u2019s latest novel Machines Like Me, Dean trawled through a factory of mannequins to find a suitable one to represent Adam, the robot at the centre of the story. She invited McEwan to help her oversee how the mannequin\u2019s face should be painted and its wig styled for the cover image. Her unconventional and experimental designs are likely to inspire a double-take. Her cover for The Largesse of the Sea Maiden by Denis Johnson involved intricately piecing together hundreds of pencil shavings so that they would resemble waves. \u201cThe best part of designing a cover is when you get a tingling buzz of recognition \u2013 you know when you\u2019ve cracked the idea,\u201d she says. Dean started out designing food packaging after studying graphic design at university. She found her calling when she got her first job designing covers at Penguin. \u201cAll these years later I still love this freedom. I still get excited when a manuscript is handed to me.\u201d To help come up with an image, she creates a mood board. \u201cThe mood board can sometimes be so big it covers the wall of my office,\u201d she says. Lines from the novel can inspire the design, as with her cover for Julian Barnes\u2019 The Only Story. \u201cOne phrase, particularly, stood out. \u2018It is better to have loved and lost then never to have loved at all\u2019 is crossed out, only to be rewritten by [the narrator] Paul. I developed this idea.\u201d Dean says book design is having a renaissance. \u201cSocial media has made it a desirable area for young designers, you only need to look at all the book blogs and Instagram.\u201d She advises designers wanting to get into the trade to be willing to experiment. \u201cI\u2019d suggest they get a portfolio together that includes their own version of books they\u2019ve read and enter competitions like the Penguin Random House student design award.\u201d Sophie Harris Junior designer, Vintage Long before she got into publishing, Sophie Harris was captivated by book covers. \u201cI\u2019ve always been fascinated by how you can distil a whole book into one single image,\u201d she says. This fascination led her to her dream job three years ago at Vintage, the Penguin Random House imprint, as a junior designer on creative director Suzanne Dean\u2019s team. Harris is currently working on the covers for four soon-to-be reissued Margaret Atwood titles: Bluebeard\u2019s Egg, Dancing Girls, Life Before Man and Bodily Harm, with the illustrator Celia Jacobs. \u201cThe best part [of the job] is feeling like you\u2019ve done a service to the author and the story, and created something sensitive and considered that excites people,\u201d she says. Harris, who is 26, studied graphic design while at university and got her first experience of book cover design during an Erasmus placement in Germany which offered a module in the subject. During the course, she got the chance to work on real briefs that had been submitted by commercial publishers. One of her cover designs \u2013 for the book Ich Wollte Einh\u00f6rner by Alina Simone \u2013 was chosen and published. After university, she interned at a few graphic design agencies and then spotted a job opportunity at Vintage. \u201cIn my mind I always wanted to be a book cover designer,\u201d she said. \u201cThen the job [at Vintage] came up. I\u2019ve never looked back.\u201d Harris\u2019 first high profile cover design at Vintage was How To Stop Brexit by Nick Clegg. She has since designed covers for other notable titles, including Our Rainbow Queen by Sali Hughes and Invisible Women by Caroline Criado Perez. \u201cInvisible Women is a really important book so I knew it would be a challenge for me,\u201d says Harris. \u201cWhen it became a top 10 bestseller it was a big moment.\u201d Harris advises anyone wanting to get into book design not to be put off if they feel they lack experience or haven\u2019t got the right contacts. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anyone in publishing,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat mattered most was that I had ideas and I was enthusiastic.\u201d Download our career starter supplement (pdf)",

For one, the retail industry\u2019s share of the UK workforce has shrunk, with 320,000 jobs being cut since 2003.

      "bodyText": "And finally... Business Insider have filed a nice piece from outside Deutsche Bank\u2019s Wall Street offices, as the company began to let staff go. Here\u2019s a flavour: Even though it was mid-morning after a holiday weekend and prime time to get into the office a little late, the door was almost exclusively letting people out. At one point, roughly five people were leaving a minute, while maybe one came back inside a few minutes later. Many of those who left the office and did not return were presumably let go from Deutsche, but almost none of them carried their desk belongings down with them. Instead, most were empty-handed and on their phones. There were a few who left holding folders, and two who carried down some belongings in blue, bank-branded tote bags. And while many staff said they hadn\u2019t been laid off today, there are worries about the future too: Multiple people who left the building indicated that they were worried that more layoffs were coming. Some of them were speaking over the phone, others in large groups, but the sentiment seemed the same. They all sensed that more cuts loomed. \u201cI don\u2019t feel so safe,\u201d said one man as he walked to lunch with a group of co-workers. Goodnight! GW The prospect of thousands of Deutsche Bank staff losing their jobs dampened the mood on Wall Street today. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day down 115 points, or -0.4%, at 26,806. Hello again. The Deutsche Bank cuts make the front page of tomorrow\u2019s FT: Here\u2019s our updated news story on the black day for Deutsche Bank staff around the world: Deutsche Bank started slashing thousands of jobs in the City of London and in New York only hours after announcing a drastic plan to reduce its global workforce by 18,000. Germany\u2019s biggest lender employs almost 8,000 people in the UK, with 7,000 in London, which is one of the main hubs for its global investment bank, where the bulk of the job losses will be focused. The jobs being cut make up about a fifth of Deutsche\u2019s global workforce of 91,500. Some staff in London were reported to be in tears after hearing their jobs had gone. Workers started leaving the bank\u2019s building in the City at around 10am carrying bags of belongings. Some said they were told their passes would stop working at 11am. A male contract worker on his way into the building in Great Winchester Street said: \u201cThe bank is not doing well, so they have to do something to get back up and running.\u201d Deutsche has failed to recover from the financial crisis of 2008 and, faced with rising costs and a falling share price, Deutsche\u2019s chief executive, Christian Sewing, is shutting the division that sells and trades shares, and cutting back on other businesses, too. The shares, which peaked at \u20ac110 in 2007, have crashed to less than \u20ac7 and lost another 5% as details of the job cuts were revealed. The cull started in the Asia Pacific region, soon after the cuts were confirmed on Sunday evening in Europe, with employees being let go in Sydney and Hong Kong. A Hong Kong equities trader told Reuters the mood was gloomy as people were called individually to meetings. \u201c[There are a] couple of rounds of chats with HR and then they give you this packet and you are out of the building,\u201d the trader said. In New York hundreds of workers were summoned to the cafeteria at Deutsche\u2019s Wall Street office to hear their fates. Employees were seen leaving with their redundancy terms in large white envelopes. Staff at the nearby Full Shilling Irish bar were expecting laid-off Deutsche workers to congregate in the afternoon. Here\u2019s the full story: More bad news. Danske Bank, the Danish lender caught up in a massive money-laundering scandal in Estonia, has also just issued a profits warning. Danske is lowering its earnings guidance, and also predicting higher costs for compliance and anti money-laundering efforts. Ouch! In another blow, German chemicals giant BASF has just issued a profits warning. The company plans to slash 6,000 jobs, after realising that earnings in the current quarter are \u201csignificantly below\u201d expectations. It is blaming a downturn in automotive markets and the North American agricultural sector -- two areas that have suffered from the US-China trade war. Back on Wall Street, employees on Deutsche Bank\u2019s equities floor said the day has been dominated by meetings about restructuring. One, who anticipated that the layoffs on the equities floor would be swift, told us: \u201cIt\u2019s obviously going to suck for a couple of years.\u201d Bank officials had indicated that Deutsche planned to overhaul its technology capabilities, suggesting one area where the trading floor had lagged. Here\u2019s our profile of Christian Sewing, the man trying to turn Deutsche Bank around with 18,000 job cuts: Deutsche Bank shares have closed 5.4% lower tonight at \u20ac6.78, as investors digest the company\u2019s restructuring plan. As flagged earlier, analysts have concerns over the implementation of the plan, and whether Deutsche can achieve solid growth while also cutting its investment bank arm. Grim-faced Deutsche employees leaving the trading floor at 60 Wall Street are extremely tight-lipped, and refusing to talk to reporters. At The Full Shilling, the Irish-themed pub where traders go after the market closed, staff were expecting laid-off employees to gather after four pm. More US-based staff who have unfortunately been caught up in the restructuring plan have been leaving Deutsche\u2019s offices on Wall Street: Staff at Deutsche Bank\u2019s Wall Street office were summoned the cafeteria to learn of their fate, says Reuters. A notice inside the building\u2019s lobby told staff the cafeteria would be closed until 11.30 a.m. EST [4.30pm UK time]. Hundreds of staff were informed during the meetings that their positions were being cut, sources within the bank told Reuters. They also received details of their redundancy packages. One source said staff could be seen saying their goodbyes to colleagues upon leaving the cafeteria. It\u2019s largely quiet outside Deutsche Bank\u2019s New York offices in midtown Manhattan today as employees are updated on the restructuring plan. A compliance officer at rival investment firm Blackstone, which is headquartered in the same swank Park Avenue building, said he was not surprised to learn of the mass layoffs. \u201cYou do fucked up shit and it comes back on you,\u201d he said, referring to the multiple allegations Deutsche is facing over Russian money laundering. \u201cWe run our clients through a sieve. Any hint, any negative news articles, any associations. It\u2019s federal law to ask questions. Our reputation is very important to us.\u201d Deutsche\u2019s New York headquarters is at 60 Wall Street (a little further south in Lower Manhattan, not far from the US stock exchange), where staff will also be briefed on Christian Sewing\u2019s plans. My colleague Nils Pratley has put his finger on the problem with Christian Sewing\u2019s plan - it should have happened a long time ago. He writes: Sewing\u2019s lower-risk formula for Deutsche\u2019s future sounds more sensible. The bank will concentrate on German retail and business markets while trying to grow in fund management; and the investment banking unit will be a slimmer operation that looks after big eurozone companies\u2019 currency and bond needs. The open question, though, is whether Deutsche has seen the light too late. \u201cWhat Deutsche Bank plans to do in the next two to three years is no more than what US and European banks have been doing in cascades ever since the end of the global financial crisis more than 10 years ago,\u201d said the rating agency Scope. Quite: at a moment when the big banking beasts, even RBS and Barclays in the UK, have declared their years of restructuring to be over, Deutsche is only now talking the language of radicalism. Job cuts are the easy part. The lesson from elsewhere is that it takes about a decade to repair a bank as broken as Deutsche. Here\u2019s the full piece: Deutsche Bank\u2019s shares are still the worst-performing stock on the German DAX index today. They\u2019re down 5% in late trading, knocking the Dax down by 0.3%. Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx says: Investors seeming to change their opinion on the announced 18,000 jobs-cull and the scale of the bank\u2019s challenges. Photographers are now poised outside Deutsche Bank\u2019s New York offices, waiting for news of how the restructuring will affect staff there. Goldman Sachs has warned that Deutsche Bank faces challenges in implementing its \u201cvery deep restructuring\u201d. GS told clients that it hadn\u2019t expected Deutsche to pull out of equities trading altogether: Media reporting ahead of Sunday\u2019s board meeting was intense, yet the announcements still surprised in terms of their scope and scale. \u201cDeutsche Bank\u2019s structural challenges, as we see them, fall into three categories: the absence of a high-return platform, elevated funding costs, and uncertainty around the scope of its investment bank business.\u201d Investors may agree that Deutsche Bank has a tough challenge.. shares are now down almost 7% afternoon trading. The big question, how does Deutsche Bank achieve growth while retrenching from investment banking? It is pinning its hopes on corporate banking, foreign exchange, deal-making, asset management, and private banking. They may be less volatile than trading equities and interest rate products, but there\u2019s still plenty of competition - especially with the rise of fintech. This is not a great time to be losing a job in finance -- trading often goes into a summer lull, so banks may not be hiring. But Joseph Leung, managing partner at City headhunters Aubreck Leung, thinks Deutsche staff who got bad news today could still be in demand. He told Bloomberg: The Deutsche people could be attractive as they are effectively free agents -- they will likely be getting their stock and won\u2019t have any notice period, so can start straightaway.\u201d Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing has told financial analysts that he will invest a \u201csubstantial\u201d amount of his fixed salary in Deutsche Bank shares. A sign of confidence in the bank? If so, it needed it -- shares were down 5% in Frankfurt a few minutes ago, after an early rally faded. Financial analysts at other banks have cautiously welcomed Deutsche\u2019s restructuring plan (while perhaps counting their blessings that they don\u2019t work there). Royal Bank of Canada say the plan is \u201cmore radical than expected\u201d, leading them to raise their price target from \u20ac7.50 to \u20ac8. But they still reckon the shares are a \u201cspeculative risk\u201d, and likely to underperform the sector while the cost-cutting plan is implemented. Deutsche Bank targets an adjusted cost base by 2022 of \u20ac17bn, which is 22% lower than its 2019 target of \u20ac21.8bn. It will exit its equities sales and trading business and resize its FICC (income instruments, currencies, and commodities) division, especially the rates team. It will also accelerate the integration of Postbank. JP Morgan Cazanove says Deutsche is finally giving up its ambitions to be a top investment bank, telling clients: Deutsche Bank restructuring in our view is bold and for the first time not half-baked but a real strategic shift giving up its Tier I investment bank ambitions. DB is rightsizing to where it came from originally, a corporate bank with the addition of a large Fixed Income footprint Correction: That pizza delivery to Deutsche Bank\u2019s London office was apparently 30 large pizzas, so not as big as we thought. Sorry for the confusion. Reuters has caught up with some of Deutsche Bank\u2019s London staff who have lost their jobs today. One IT worker leaving its City of London office confirmed that some staff got the bad news this morning. \u201cI was terminated this morning. There was a very quick meeting and that was it\u201d A second, on the equity sales side, emerged from the building and headed to the pub, saying: \u201cI got laid off, where else would I go?\u201d Over in New York, Deutsche Bank staff are heading into the office to learn whether they still have a job. According to Efinancial News, some US staff have been told to report for meetings. That could be bad news for those on the equities trading side, which Deutsche plans to exit. In New York, equities professionals were among those receiving a letter yesterday from CEO Christian Sewing acknowledging that, \u201cthis impacts people and affects their lives in a profound way.\u201d One said he arrived in the office early and was still able to login to the bank\u2019s systems. \u201cThey kept everyone out of the systems both physically and virtually over the weekend, but for now everything\u2019s open,\u201d he said. However, he said members of the NY equities floor have been asked to attend ominous meetings later in the day: \u201c9.30am is when most people in my division have been asked to report to the auditorium to be fired.\u201d Other New York employees said people are being invited to these meetings even if they\u2019re on holiday. A large consignment of pizza has just arrived at Deutsche Bank\u2019s London offices. According to a delivery person, some 30 large boxes have been ordered for staff at its headquarters today [corrected]. The Balls Brothers Austin Friars bar round the corner from the Deutsche head office is starting to fill up with lunchtime drinkers. One fund manager who was drinking bubbly inside the bar with his mates said they were not from Deutsche, adding: \u201cWe are celebrating that we are not at Deutsche.\u201d A woman he was drinking with said she knew how people at Deutsche felt because she had been laid off ten years ago from her job in equities trading - the division Deutsche is shutting down - at the German bank Dresdner, which got taken over by Commerzbank. She now works as a freelance photographer and said she can spend more time with her children. She said the support staff in banks would fare worst because they would not have been able to set much money aside and would not get a big severance package. For example, when she lost her job during the financial crisis, she talked to the young women in the coffee shop on her trading floor at Dresdner who told her they would also lose their jobs - they were being given two weeks\u2019 notice and had to work their notice period. A couple of people have now left Deutsche Bank\u2019s offices carrying boxes: We can\u2019t confirm whether they\u2019ve been hit by the job cuts, but the scene is reminiscent of the collapse of Lehman Brothers more than a decade ago. A quick summary of the main events so far: Deutsche Bank has begun a huge job cuts programme, as the German banking giant retrenches in an attempt to rebuild its fortunes. Staff across its Asia-Pacific offices, and in the City of London, have been updated on Deutsche\u2019s decision to wind back its investment banking, ditching equities trading altogether. The plan will see 18,000 jobs cut (either eliminated or through not filling vacancies) over the next three years - with the first cuts coming today. Deutsche bankers leaving offices in Hong Kong and Sydney confirmed that they had been laid off, just hours after CEO Christian Sewing revealed his restructuring plans. The mood is bleak in Tokyo too. In London, some staff have been left in tears, we hear, as they learned what the cuts mean for them. Others say they were told to clear their desks this morning, although few staff have been commenting to press outside the offices yet. In a letter to staff, Sewing said the cuts are deeply regretful, but also necessary if Deutsche is to return to stronger profitability. He wrote: First let me say this: I am very much aware that in rebuilding our bank, we are making deep cuts. I personally greatly regret the impact this will have on some of you. In the long-term interests of our bank, however, we have no choice other than to approach this transformation decisively. Under the plan, Deutsche will downsize its investment bank, stop dealing in equities, shift underperforming assets to a new unit where they will be wound down, and create a new corporate banking arm. It will also cut its global workforce to around 72,000 by 20220. The plan will cost \u20ac7.4bn by 2022, including a \u20ac3bn hit this quarter. On a conference call, Sewing told reporters that Deutsche was still planning to open a new London HQ, above Moorgate Station. Deutsche Bank staff facing job losses in London will be given \u201cnotification risk\u201d notices, says the FT. Then, after a consultation session with human resources, they will be given the rest of the day off. Deutsche Bank\u2019s restructuring plan is the latest twist in its \u201cdesperate struggle for survival\u201d, say the analyst team at foreign exchange platform FxPro. But although its shares have recovered from a record low below \u20ac6 last month to around \u20ac7.40 this morning, the future looks challenging. By tempering ambitions and reducing staff \u2013 including the exit from the U.S. market \u2013 Deutsche Bank abandons the ambitions of further development. Looking ahead, it calls into question its ability to gain a foothold above the level of \u20ac20 per share, not to mention the historical highs near \u20ac95.\u201d My colleague Julia Kollewe is stationed outside Deutsche Bank\u2019s offices in London. There are several taxis waiting outside 1 Great Winchester Street office, perhaps for those who have been told to clear their desks this morning. One banker who was carrying a laptop bag declined to comment as he got into a pre-booked black cab. Alexandra Annecke, portfolio manager at German asset manager Union Investment, says Deutsche Bank\u2019s restructuring is long overdue. She writes: \u201cIn view of the changed framework conditions, the adjustment of the strategy announced by Deutsche Bank was well overdue. Regulation, the low interest rate environment and competitive pressures, combined with the long adherence to an old strategy, all required radical steps. The announced measures are indeed a radical cure. Deutsche Bank\u2019s problems are compounded by the weakness in Germany\u2019s economy, which nearly fell into recession last year. In a worrying development this morning, German investment morale has plunged this month to a near ten-year low. A wider measure of confidence across the eurozone also weakened, to its lowest since November 2014, according to research group Sentix. Sentix director Patrick Hussy fears that a German recession \u201clooks unavoidable\u201d, as the US-China trade war hurts its companies. \u201cThe high dependence on exports and the Chinese sales market is increasingly becoming a burden and the trade dispute hangs like a sword of Damocles over the one-time poster boy of the euro region.\u201d The FT has also confirmed that Deutsche Bank staff are being asked to leave the building: One staff member who said he was a manager in the equities department said he had been called into a meeting room, dismissed and told to clear his desk and leave. \u201cIt\u2019s quite strange because the stuff I was working on still impacts the portfolio so I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do with it,\u201d he said as he exited Deutsche\u2019s London headquarters carrying a small white box with personal effects. Q: Are people being asked to leave? A: \u201cYes\u201d, one Deutsche member of staff in London confirms. The German bank employs 7,990 in the UK - 7,000 in London. Most them work in the main offices on Great Winchester Street [round the back of London Wall]. Deutsche also has an office in Canary Wharf. Some Deutsche Bank staff may have seen the writing on the wall, and not shown up to learn their fate: Back outside Deutsche\u2019s London offices, an IT contractor tells us he had heard that about 100 people had been made redundant on the fourth floor at the 1 Great Winchester Street office and some people were crying. The early rally in Deutsche Bank shares has fizzled out: The bank\u2019s bonds also enjoyed a brief rise, but that\u2019s gone too... [CoCo = contingent convertible bonds, a kind of debt that converts into equity if the issuer hits trouble] Reuters has done an excellent wrap-up of comments from Deutsche Bank staff across Asia-Pacific offices today, as they learned whether they were affected by the job cuts. One equities trader in Hong Kong said he and his colleagues were escorted from their meetings with Human Resources (HR) to the elevators without being allowed to return to their desks. There is hardly any work getting done today and folks are just mailing or calling friends or headhunters. Half of the floor is gone and others are just waiting to be called in. Some people are saying their byes even before being called in.\u201d Another equities trader confirmed that the mood was bleak [understandable, given Deutsche is bailing out of the equities business]: \u201cThe mood inside is pretty gloomy. People are being called in individually into the conference rooms with a couple of rounds of chats with HR, who will give you this packet then and you are out of the building. Even those who are staying back don\u2019t think it\u2019s the turning point for the bank. Who wants to go into a bad bank just to wind down the businesses? So more people will leave when they get the opportunity. Personally, I think they (management) have taken a very shortsighted decision: Equities is a cyclical business and it\u2019s not like DB was the only bank not making any money in this.\u201d More here: Factbox: What Deutsche bankers are saying about the 18,000 global job cuts Several people have just left Deutsche Bank\u2019s offices on 1 Great Winchester Street, carrying large bags. Would they like to comment on what\u2019s happening? \u201cNo, thanks,\u201d replies one young woman, carrying a pink holdall with documents sticking out. Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief financial officer, James von Moltke, is also on the conference call. He says the bank is striving to \u201cbreak even or better\u201d in 2020, but admits there is significant uncertainty in that forecast. [reminder: Deutsche will make a loss of \u20ac2.8bn this quarter, due to the restructuring]. Deutsche Bank says its plans for a new London headquarters will not be affected by the restructuring. The HQ is being constructed in the City, above the Moorgate ticket offices, with a large steel-and-glass facade. It will create 564,000 square feet of space, including retail and commercial office space. Here\u2019s an artist impression of Deutsche Bank\u2019s new headquarters in London, from architects WilkinsonEyre. The mood inside Deutsche Bank\u2019s London offices must be grim this morning, as staff learn their fate. The Telegraph\u2019s Lucy Burton had heard some staff have been told to clear their desks this morning, before their security passes are deactivated. DB CEO Christian Sewing adds that London will remain \u201ca critical part\u201d of Deutsche Bank, from a size point of view. Deutsche currently employs around 7,500 people in the City. Deutsche Bank is holding a conference call with the media now. CEO Christian Sewing is explaining that Deutsche Bank spread itself too thinly across banking, as it tried to compete with Wall Street investment banks while also offering private and commercial banking services. The WSJ\u2019s Jenny Strasburg has more details: Deutsche Bank has confirmed to Australian Associated Press that it will wind down its Australian equities division, but won\u2019t say how many jobs will be cut. AAP says: The bank was meeting its Australian staff on Monday to discuss how the firm\u2019s global downsizing plan would affect its local presence. Deutsche confirmed to AAP its Australian equities division would wind down as part of plans to scrap its global equities business Former City banker Philip Augar says Deutsche Bank is finally adjusting to the impact of the financial crisis a decade ago. Low interest rates, for example, make investment banking less profitable. Deutsche is also laden with billions of euros of derivatives contracts, many of which are now being shuttled into its new \u2018bad bank\u2019 to be wound down. Augar explained on Radio 5\u2019s Wake Up To Money this morning that Deutsche has been putting off the inevitable for a long time... Deutsche Bank\u2019s CEO says he \u201cdeeply regrets\u201d the impact that his restructuring plan will have on the workforce, with one in five jobs to go. In a letter to DB staff, Christian Sewing explains why 18,000 jobs are being cut: First let me say this: I am very much aware that in rebuilding our bank, we are making deep cuts. I personally greatly regret the impact this will have on some of you. In the long-term interests of our bank, however, we have no choice other than to approach this transformation decisively. He also outlined how he plans to take DB \u201cback to its roots\u201d, cutting fixed costs and refocusing on corporate banking not investment banking. Sewing says: Going forward, we will have four businesses that will be entirely focused on our clients. We are focusing our Investment Bank, we will be less dependent on Sales &amp; Trading and are shrinking our balance sheet. We are creating a Corporate Bank which will be at the centre of our bank. We aim to reduce our adjusted costs by over a quarter and to simultaneously invest 13 billion euros in technology by 2022. And we are not asking our shareholders to pay for this transformation but instead plan to return capital to them. All of this will create a new, better Deutsche Bank. However, we also have to face the fact that this transformation will require uncomfortable decisions. This is especially true for the sizeable workforce reductions. I can assure you that my colleagues and I appreciate that this impacts people and affects their lives in a profound way. That is why we will do whatever it takes to implement these cuts as responsibly as possible \u2013 I consider it our duty to do so. The works councils and employee representatives will be consulted where applicable and statutory participation rights will be safeguarded. Several Deutsche Bank board members are leaving the company, under the restructuring plan. Chief regulatory officer Sylvie Matherat, and private &amp; commercial bank chief Frank Strauss will depart on July 31. Deutsche Bank\u2019s investment banking chief Garth Ritchie - who has been collecting a \u20ac250k a month salary boost for making preparations for Brexit - also quit late last week. Deutsche says these departures are part of a shake-up to \u201caccelerate decision-making\u2019 and encourage entrepreneurship. Here\u2019s the official announcement from Deutsche Bank yesterday, outlining its restructuring: Deutsche Bank outlines significant strategic transformation and restructuring plans Deutsche Bank staff have been arriving at work in central London, to learn how the restructuring plan affects them. Deutsche has several offices close to Liverpool Street station, within the City of London. One male contractor said on his way into 1 Great Winchester Street where Deutsche\u2019s trading arm is based, told us: \u201cThe bank is not doing well so they have to do something to get back up and running.\u201d Other staff are declining to comment. Deutsche Bank is one of the top stocks in Europe this morning, hitting its highest levels since early May. Alas, they\u2019ve still been a rather poor investment in the last decade - back in 2009 they changed hands at \u20ac40 each, rather than around \u20ac7.40 today. Shares in Deutsche Bank have risen at the start of trading in Frankfurt, up over 3% at \u20ac7.42, Investors appear to welcome its plan to scale back investment banking, stop trading shares and create a new bad bank to handle its bad debts. Instead of competing with Wall Street investment bank giants, Deutsche is now planning to focus on corporate banking, financing, foreign exchange, private banking and asset management. The plan won\u2019t be cheap, though. Deutsche expects to take around \u20ac3bn of upfront restructuring costs, which will create a net loss of \u20ac2.8bn for the current financial quarter. The total bill is expected to hit \u20ac7.4bn by 2022. In Tokyo, Deutsche Bank staff were summoned to a meeting where senior managers told them the equities trading operation all across Asia would be shut, reports the Financial Times. The bank\u2019s human resources team started group sessions with affected employees immediately afterwards, with whole teams of equity traders in Tokyo and other Asian locations being dismissed. The FT says: When asked about the atmosphere in the office on Monday morning, a Singapore-based employee whose team had not been hit by the cuts said: \u201cThe mood is always depressed in Deutsche. People know the bank is not doing well . . . It\u2019s not like a party\u201d. Whole teams in Deutsche Bank\u2019s Asian operations have reportedly been told their positions are being eliminated, as the bank moves swiftly to start axing 18,000 jobs globally Reuters is reporting that bankers in Sydney got the bad news today. Deutsche Bank gave no geographic breakdown for the job cuts when it announced the plan on Sunday. Bankers in Sydney seen leaving the lender\u2019s offices on Monday confirmed they worked for Deutsche Bank and were being laid off, but declined to give their names as they were due to return later to sign redundancy packages. One person with knowledge of the bank\u2019s operations in Australia said its four-strong equity capital markets team was being let go, but that most of its mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) team would not be immediately affected. DB\u2019s Hong Kong operations have also been hit: In Hong Kong, a group of three upset-looking bank employees took a picture of themselves besides a large Deutsche Bank logo outside the lender\u2019s office, hugging each other before hailing a waiting taxi. One Hong Kong-based equities trader who had been laid off said the mood was \u201cpretty gloomy\u201d as people were called individually to meetings. \u201c(There are a) couple of rounds of chats with HR and then they give you this packet and you are out of the building,\u201d the trader said. Several workers were seen leaving the offices holding large envelopes with the bank\u2019s logo. \u201cIf you have a job for me please let me know. But do not ask questions,\u201d said one who confirmed he was employed at Deutsche Bank, but declined to comment further. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s a dark day for staff at Deutsche Bank, after the banking giant announced plans to cut 18,000 jobs around the globe, or around a fifth of its workforce. The axe is hovering over staff in the City of London, where Deutsche employs thousands of people, and in New York and in offices across the Asia-Pacific region. Reuters is reporting that \u2018whole teams\u2019 in some Asian operations have already been sent home today (more on that shortly). The job cuts are part of a radical restructuring of ailing Deutsche Bank, which has suffered from weak profitability and a string of fines for misconduct. Under the plan, it will cut back its investment banking operations, ending its equities trading business and shrinking its bond and rates trading operations. This will help reduce its headcount to around 74,000. It is also spinning off around \u20ac74bn of under-performing loans into a new bad bank, as CEO Christian Sewing tries desperately to kickstart the company. My colleague Simon Goodley reports: Hundreds of City workers are fearing for their jobs after Deutsche Bank, the global bank that is one of the Square Mile\u2019s largest employers, said it plans to axe 18,000 staff worldwide in the latest attempt to revitalise its reputation and business. The layoffs, equivalent to 20% of the bank\u2019s workforce, come after chief executive Christian Sewing flagged an extensive restructuring in May, when he promised shareholders \u201ctough cutbacks\u201d to the investment bank and that he would push ahead with a further \u20ac1bn (\u00a3880m) in cuts this year. The pledge came after similar moves in 2018 that led to 6,000 job losses, and a failure to agree a merger with rival Commerzbank. Also coming up today Investors will also be digesting yesterday\u2019s Greek general election, which saw the right-wing New Democracy party oust the incumbent left-wing Syriza party. PM Alexis Tsipras has conceded, so ND\u2019s Kyriakos Mitsotakis should be sworn in today. The Turkish lira is also under pressure, after president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan sacked the country\u2019s central bank governor. The sudden removal of Murat Cetinkaya is undermining confidence in the bank\u2019s independence, given Erdo\u011fan\u2019s regular demands for lower interest rates. That\u2019s sent the lira down 2% this morning. The agenda 7am BST: German industrial production and trade data 9.30am BST: Sentix survey of eurozone investor confidence",

      "body": "<p>Labour has set out plans to ban the sale of new private leasehold houses and flats in an overhaul of property ownership rules that could slash the costs for homeowners of buying their freeholds.</p> <p>The shadow housing secretary, John Healey, said the proposals would end exploitative practices by freeholds, \u201cfrom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/mar/31/homeowners-caught-in-a-crippling-ground-rent-trap\">rip-off ground rents</a>, to punitive fees to onerous contract conditions stating what they can and can\u2019t do to their own homes\u201d.</p> <p>The government has already announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/27/government-to-axe-leaseholds-for-new-build-homes\">it will axe leaseholds on all new-build houses</a>, though it is not clear when the measures will formally take effect. However, the Labour policy also proposes a ban on the sale of new leasehold flats by the end of the Labour government\u2019s first term, a substantially larger number of homes.</p> <p>It also says leaseholders should be able to buy the freehold of their home for 1% of the property value, which could substantially lower the costs. However, owners of current leasehold flats are likely to need to band together to buy the freehold of the block.</p> <p>At least 4.3 million homes across England are owned on a leasehold basis. For a property in England priced at \u00a3250,000 with a 90-year lease, Labour says its proposals could mean the cost of buying the freehold is slashed from over \u00a310,000 to \u00a32,500.</p> <p>It also calls for ground rents for existing leaseholders to be capped at 0.1% of the property value, up to a maximum of \u00a3250 a year. The government has also already announced plans to tackle exploitative ground rents, slashing them to zero on new leasehold flats.</p> <p>There have been cases where buyers have discovered that their ground rent doubles every 10 or 15 years, including one example of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/oct/22/small-print-ground-rent-property-millions-leasehold-flat\"> a Birmingham flat owner</a> who discovered her ground rent was not \u00a3250 a year, as she had believed, but was now \u00a38,000 a year and would keep doubling so that in 95 years it would be \u00a38m.</p> <p>\u201cLeasehold is a symbol of our broken housing system, with millions of England\u2019s homeowners feeling like they\u2019ve bought their home but still don\u2019t own it,\u201d Healey said.</p> <p>\u201cWe need a revolution in rights for leaseholders. This consultation document sets out the next Labour government\u2019s ambition to end the broken leasehold model for good.\u201d</p> <p>The shadow housing minister, Sarah Jones, said leaseholders often had the odds stacked against them. \u201cEngland is one of the only places in the world which has failed to move away from this feudal system,\u201d she said.</p> <p>One leasehold flat owner, Jay Beeharry, told the authors of the report he had been charged \u00a350,000 in fees over four years after buying a modest two-bedroom flat in London. \u201cI have lost thousands of pounds, significant time, life and equity in my leasehold flat that I have been unable to sell. I have been threatened with forfeiture of my home,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cResidents tried to challenge the freeholder four times in tribunals \u2013 where in one case we were told repair costs had risen from \u00a379,000 to \u00a3525,000 and another case where repairs had risen further to \u00a3600,000. I discovered an invoice which showed residents had been charged \u00a372,000 for part of the works which only cost \u00a321,500.\u201d</p> <p>Martin Boyd, the chair of the campaign group Leasehold Knowledge Partnership, said the proposals were well thought through and signalled a political consensus was building on the issue.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s likely to give a lot more certainty to leaseholders knowing where they stand. The reality is that developers are finding it harder to sell leasehold houses anyway and that market has almost collapsed. But the commitment to end leasehold flats within the first term of a Labour government is excellent,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He said there were still \u201chuge issue with existing right-to-buy properties\u201d, including leaseholders who had purchased former council homes being hit with huge bills. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/may/18/a-terrible-shock-council-flat-owner-bill-tustin-estate\">Earlier this year</a>, 20 leaseholders in Southwark, south London, received estimated bills of up to \u00a3151,000 each for the regeneration of the estate where they had bought their homes.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Labour has set out plans to ban the sale of new private leasehold houses and flats in an overhaul of property ownership rules that could slash the costs for homeowners of buying their freeholds. The shadow housing secretary, John Healey, said the proposals would end exploitative practices by freeholds, \u201cfrom rip-off ground rents, to punitive fees to onerous contract conditions stating what they can and can\u2019t do to their own homes\u201d. The government has already announced it will axe leaseholds on all new-build houses, though it is not clear when the measures will formally take effect. However, the Labour policy also proposes a ban on the sale of new leasehold flats by the end of the Labour government\u2019s first term, a substantially larger number of homes. It also says leaseholders should be able to buy the freehold of their home for 1% of the property value, which could substantially lower the costs. However, owners of current leasehold flats are likely to need to band together to buy the freehold of the block. At least 4.3 million homes across England are owned on a leasehold basis. For a property in England priced at \u00a3250,000 with a 90-year lease, Labour says its proposals could mean the cost of buying the freehold is slashed from over \u00a310,000 to \u00a32,500. It also calls for ground rents for existing leaseholders to be capped at 0.1% of the property value, up to a maximum of \u00a3250 a year. The government has also already announced plans to tackle exploitative ground rents, slashing them to zero on new leasehold flats. There have been cases where buyers have discovered that their ground rent doubles every 10 or 15 years, including one example of a Birmingham flat owner who discovered her ground rent was not \u00a3250 a year, as she had believed, but was now \u00a38,000 a year and would keep doubling so that in 95 years it would be \u00a38m. \u201cLeasehold is a symbol of our broken housing system, with millions of England\u2019s homeowners feeling like they\u2019ve bought their home but still don\u2019t own it,\u201d Healey said. \u201cWe need a revolution in rights for leaseholders. This consultation document sets out the next Labour government\u2019s ambition to end the broken leasehold model for good.\u201d The shadow housing minister, Sarah Jones, said leaseholders often had the odds stacked against them. \u201cEngland is one of the only places in the world which has failed to move away from this feudal system,\u201d she said. One leasehold flat owner, Jay Beeharry, told the authors of the report he had been charged \u00a350,000 in fees over four years after buying a modest two-bedroom flat in London. \u201cI have lost thousands of pounds, significant time, life and equity in my leasehold flat that I have been unable to sell. I have been threatened with forfeiture of my home,\u201d he said. \u201cResidents tried to challenge the freeholder four times in tribunals \u2013 where in one case we were told repair costs had risen from \u00a379,000 to \u00a3525,000 and another case where repairs had risen further to \u00a3600,000. I discovered an invoice which showed residents had been charged \u00a372,000 for part of the works which only cost \u00a321,500.\u201d Martin Boyd, the chair of the campaign group Leasehold Knowledge Partnership, said the proposals were well thought through and signalled a political consensus was building on the issue. \u201cIt\u2019s likely to give a lot more certainty to leaseholders knowing where they stand. The reality is that developers are finding it harder to sell leasehold houses anyway and that market has almost collapsed. But the commitment to end leasehold flats within the first term of a Labour government is excellent,\u201d he said. He said there were still \u201chuge issue with existing right-to-buy properties\u201d, including leaseholders who had purchased former council homes being hit with huge bills. Earlier this year, 20 leaseholders in Southwark, south London, received estimated bills of up to \u00a3151,000 each for the regeneration of the estate where they had bought their homes.",

It won her the title of the best unsigned Indigenous artist in the country, and a spot performing at the National Indigenous music awards, and \u201cit all started from there\u201d. For stalwart fans, the album, titled Better in Blak \u2013 a collection of plainspoken, sparkling pop songs and naked acoustic ballads \u2013 has been a long time coming. But it\u2019s been a \u201creally rough\u201d couple of years for Plum, who didn\u2019t want to rush work, and who had been on the receiving end of waves of abuse from an old battle back home. Media roundup Josh Frydenberg has repudiated calls for the government to provide further fiscal stimulus to the economy, the Australian reports. The Australian Financial Review leads with S&amp;P Global Ratings\u2019 urging the government to stick to its budget surplus plan to maintain Australia\u2019s AAA credit rating, rejecting calls from some economists to relax budget repair and inject fiscal stimulus into the economy. The top story on the Sydney Morning Herald\u2019s front page this morning is that up to 90% of music fans use drugs, according to NSW Ministry of Health data. The paper also reports that the Australian federal police used national security laws to access the metadata of journalists nearly 60 times in just one year. Coming up Witnesses including emergency services staff, medical experts and music festival organisers are expected to be called to give evidence at an inquest into six drug-related deaths at music festivals in NSW. The Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young will take part in a protest at South Australia\u2019s Parliament House over water use in the Murray-Darling basin.

      "bodyText": "Labor\u2019s leader in the Senate, Penny Wong, has said new religious discrimination laws should not make Australia a less accepting or tolerant country. The attorney general, Christian Porter, has started workshops with MPs on the government\u2019s proposed religious discrimination bill, with some conservative MPs pushing for a broader \u201creligious freedom\u201d bill. Speaking on ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A program on Monday night, Wong said she hoped the debate over religious discrimination could be not partisan. \u201cI hope it can be done with the objective of ensuring just as Australians of faith don\u2019t wish to be discriminated against that Australians of other attributes also don\u2019t wish to be discriminated against,\u201d Wong said. \u201cI\u2019m happy \u2013 and I think the Labor party is happy \u2013 to engage constructively. What I don\u2019t want to see is the objectives that are part of \u2026 Australian identity, tolerant, accepting nation, in which people are treated equally. \u201cI don\u2019t want those abrogated. That requires a very sensitive and respectful discussion.\u201d The Senate president, Scott Ryan, said he was \u201cparticularly radical and liberal\u201d on the issue of free speech, and didn\u2019t think some kinds of speech should only be legal because of a person\u2019s religious view. \u201cI don\u2019t know if something can be said \u2013 or something that is said \u2013 should be legal because of a particularly religious view, whether that be being Christian, being Muslim or the writings of L Ron Hubbard,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we need to be careful. I don\u2019t think we need laws limiting speech.\u201d \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But Ryan said the religious discrimination law should not be so broad as to kick the issue of freedom of speech and religious discrimination completely to the courts. On the rugby player Israel Folau\u2019s social media posts that resulted in his Rugby Australia contract being axed and kicked off the religious discrimination debate in Australia, Wong said she wished people in his position considered the impact of their words. \u201cCan I say, first on an emotional level, I wish that we could have more expressions of love and forgiveness rather than condemnation when it came to belief,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish public figures, politicians, sporting stars, may consider \u2013 I think I have been on this show saying this before \u2013 where their words land in vulnerable Australians.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "California congressman Eric Swalwell has withdrawn from the 2020 presidential race, ending his longshot candidacy for the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination to instead focus on his re-election to the House of Representatives. Swalwell suspended his bid in an announcement from his California headquarters on Monday afternoon. In a written message on his 2020 campaign website, Swalwell said \u201cpolling and fundraising numbers weren\u2019t what we had hoped for and I no longer see a path forward to the nomination\u201d. \u201cMy presidential campaign ends today, but this also is the start of a new passage for the issues on which our campaign ran,\u201d he continued. Speaking later, he added: \u201cWe need a candidate who\u2019s tested \u2026 because Trump is the best political puncher ever in American politics, so whoever we send to that debate stage \u2026 is going to have to take a punch, throw a punch and then unite the country at the end of the campaign.\u201d News of Swalwell\u2019s departure came as another Californian, Tom Steyer, was poised to enter the crowded Democratic field, which features more than 20 candidates. Steyer, a billionaire environmental activist, had previously stated he would not run for president in 2020 but reportedly told staffers last week he would formally launch a presidential campaign on Tuesday. Steyer has led the movement to impeach Donald Trump and emerged over the past decade as the top Democratic donor in the US. The Democratic contenders faced off in the first set of primary debates last month, which for some proved a breakout moment but for others did little to advance their prospects. Swalwell, who despite being a prominent face in Washington remains virtually unknown on the national stage, has languished in the polls since launching his campaign in April. Signs of trouble were evident last week when Swalwell canceled a two-day swing through the key battleground of New Hampshire. The 38-year-old congressman had hoped to cast himself as part of a new generation of leaders; but others, such as South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg, have instead claimed that ground in the early stages of the 2020 primary. Swalwell sought to distinguish himself by making gun control a central plank of his campaign, choosing to launch his bid near the site of the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Florida. \u201cI\u2019m just so thankful that he ran, and that he ran on doing something about gun violence,\u201d said Fred Guttenberg, the Parkland father whose 14-year-old daughter Jaime was one of 17 students and educators killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school. Guttenberg, who did not formally endorse any candidates but had praised Swalwell\u2019s focus on gun control, said he was confident that the issue of gun violence would stay at the center of the 2020 Democratic primary campaign. Among Swalwell\u2019s bolder proposals was a plan to spend $15bn on an Australia-style federal ban and buyback of military-style \u201cassault weapons\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re not just here to stand up to the NRA,\u201d he said outside the National Rifle Association headquarters in Virginia last month. \u201cWe\u2019re here to beat the NRA.\u201d With additional reporting by Lois Beckett in Oakland",

MPs like deploring.</p> <p>The government had full confidence in Darroch \u2013 in football parlance, a clear warning to the ambassador to pack his bags \u2013 and it was the responsibility of all diplomats to give honest, unvarnished assessments.

As in, it agreed with every word, but wanted to give itself deniability headroom.</p> <p>This wasn\u2019t good enough, insisted Tom Tugendhat, the chair of the foreign affairs select committee. There had been too many leaks from government departments and many military top brass were also anxious that their reports might become public knowledge \u2013 though less so now that Gavin Williamson had been sacked as defence secretary. What was required was not just an internal inquiry into the leak, but a full-on criminal investigation.</p> <p>\u201cSteady on, old boy,\u201d Duncan replied evenly. One didn\u2019t want to be too hasty. You could never tell where a criminal investigation might end up. Who knows, it might even turn out that the leaker was someone close to the next prime minister, and then where we would be? Far better to find a special adviser to act as the fall guy and then let the whole thing drop. Least said, soonest mended.</p> <p>The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, was also determined to be a model of statecraft. All that mattered was a point of principle and she didn\u2019t want to get involved in any possible conspiracy theories \u2013 though many others were more than happy to do just that. The Scottish National party\u2019s Stephen Gethins detected the dead hand of Nigel Farage in all of this. Not least because the journalist who got the leaked emails was the Brexit-supporting journalist Isabel Oakeshott.</p> <p>Duncan shook his head. Everyone should just chill out a little. Just because the story had been handed to one of the country\u2019s most prominent Brexit-supporting hacks, one shouldn\u2019t leap to conclusions that the leak had been intended to undermine the credibility of a UK ambassador who was understood to have misgivings about leaving the EU. Instead, we should just try to think of it as a bit of a coincidence. A piece of bad luck and crap timing.</p> <p>Though there was an upside to all this, Duncan went on to say. The fact that Darroch had been able to speak so freely about Trump \u2013 and it hadn\u2019t all been nasty: he had also mentioned that the president could sometimes speak in joined-up sentences \u2013 was testament to the special relationship between the US and the UK. Just try to imagine the hard-hitting emails Woody Johnson, the US ambassador in London, might be sending back to Washington. The rubbish cartoon channels. The queues at Alton Towers. People still moaning about the penalty in the women\u2019s soccerball semi-final. So, for a second time, please could everyone stop with the conspiracies.</p> <p>Some hope. Conservatives Julian Lewis and Andrew Bridgen were adamant that the leak must have come from No 10 itself, with Theresa May desperate to replace Darroch with Mark Sedwill, the head of the civil service and another remainer, in one of her last acts as prime minister. That she had resorted to giving the leak to a Brexit journalist merely illustrated how low she had sunk. Typical establishment dirty tricks to undermine those men of the people Boris Johnson and Farage.</p> <p>Bill Cash went further still. The fact that Darroch had even uttered a word of criticism about such a paragon of goodliness as the Donald merely proved he was totally unfit to be ambassador. A diplomat with a clear eye would surely have reported on the clarity of the Chosen Orange One\u2019s thinking and the brilliance of his teeth. \u201cONE TRUE BREXIT,\u201d he yelled. \u201cTHE THOUSAND-YEAR BREXIT.\u201d That was too much even for many Tories. It\u2019s long past Cash\u2019s bedtime. And time for his medication.</p> <p>Duncan continued to tread a fine line between supporting Darroch in thought and deed and maintaining some objectivity. He really had no idea how many people might have received the emails. Perhaps 100 or people initially, but after Boris, Gavin, the Russians and anyone else with an interest in the Tory leadership race had got their hands on them, the figure could quickly run into thousands.</p> <p>Sensing he had overreached himself, Duncan begged MPs to go back to doing what they did best: go heavy on the moral outrage and forget the details. Besides, Trump would be bound to prove Darroch\u2019s judgement right soon enough by sticking his nose in, and then the shit would really hit the fan.</p> <p>Sure enough, just after 7.30pm, the US president took time out from watching Tom and Jerry to tweet that May was useless, Darroch was a nonentity, and he wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with either of them again. We were on a war footing unless the UK backed down and appointed an ambassador who knew how to brown-nose properly. Boris, Farage and Oakeshott let out a cheer. Job done for the Brexiters.</p> <p>\u2022 Note added 19 July 2019: This satirical sketch originally included a comment - fictitious, of course - which could have been interpreted as being of a sexual and vulgar nature about Isabel Oakeshott. Although this was not our intention, we acknowledge the potential for distress and misinterpretation and we apologise to her for any distress this has caused.</p>",

The fact that Darroch had been able to speak so freely about Trump \u2013 and it hadn\u2019t all been nasty: he had also mentioned that the president could sometimes speak in joined-up sentences \u2013 was testament to the special relationship between the US and the UK. Just try to imagine the hard-hitting emails Woody Johnson, the US ambassador in London, might be sending back to Washington. The rubbish cartoon channels. The queues at Alton Towers. People still moaning about the penalty in the women\u2019s soccerball semi-final. So, for a second time, please could everyone stop with the conspiracies. Some hope. Conservatives Julian Lewis and Andrew Bridgen were adamant that the leak must have come from No 10 itself, with Theresa May desperate to replace Darroch with Mark Sedwill, the head of the civil service and another remainer, in one of her last acts as prime minister. That she had resorted to giving the leak to a Brexit journalist merely illustrated how low she had sunk. Typical establishment dirty tricks to undermine those men of the people Boris Johnson and Farage. Bill Cash went further still. The fact that Darroch had even uttered a word of criticism about such a paragon of goodliness as the Donald merely proved he was totally unfit to be ambassador. A diplomat with a clear eye would surely have reported on the clarity of the Chosen Orange One\u2019s thinking and the brilliance of his teeth. \u201cONE TRUE BREXIT,\u201d he yelled. \u201cTHE THOUSAND-YEAR BREXIT.\u201d That was too much even for many Tories. It\u2019s long past Cash\u2019s bedtime. And time for his medication. Duncan continued to tread a fine line between supporting Darroch in thought and deed and maintaining some objectivity. He really had no idea how many people might have received the emails. Perhaps 100 or people initially, but after Boris, Gavin, the Russians and anyone else with an interest in the Tory leadership race had got their hands on them, the figure could quickly run into thousands. Sensing he had overreached himself, Duncan begged MPs to go back to doing what they did best: go heavy on the moral outrage and forget the details. Besides, Trump would be bound to prove Darroch\u2019s judgement right soon enough by sticking his nose in, and then the shit would really hit the fan. Sure enough, just after 7.30pm, the US president took time out from watching Tom and Jerry to tweet that May was useless, Darroch was a nonentity, and he wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with either of them again. We were on a war footing unless the UK backed down and appointed an ambassador who knew how to brown-nose properly. Boris, Farage and Oakeshott let out a cheer. Job done for the Brexiters. \u2022 Note added 19 July 2019: This satirical sketch originally included a comment - fictitious, of course - which could have been interpreted as being of a sexual and vulgar nature about Isabel Oakeshott.

It is no exaggeration to say that, without Scott, the Lionesses may not have reached the final four.</p> \n<p><strong>Goal of the tournament</strong> Lucy Bronze v Norway. An imperious, unerring, first-time, 25-yard strike. The look on the watching David Beckham\u2019s face after he had admired its inexorable trajectory towards the top corner spoke volumes. </p> \n<p><strong>Personal highlight</strong> A tie between a taxi driver who recognised me in Nice airport and rushed over saying \u201c<em>Bonjour madame</em>\u201d and another in Paris who carried my case \u2013 at full gallop \u2013 to the correct station platform, enabling me to catch a train to Lyon with a minute to spare.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b5c42063-e9a0-49a2-92c5-24ba2021a269\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Twitter:</b> follow us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian_sport\">@guardian_sport</a></p>\n    <p><b>Facebook:</b> like our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardianfootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiansport\">sport</a> pages</p>\n    <p><b>Instagram:</b> our favourite <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardian_sport/\">photos, films and stories</a></p>\n    <p><b>YouTube:</b> subscribe to our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/GuardianFootball\">football</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwD9E_QNwFwrQC7OnPnrg2Q\">sport</a> channels</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Biggest disappointment</strong> Cameroon\u2019s appalling behaviour as they lost against England in a game which turned into high farce. It was comedic at times but also a truly dreadful, and depressing, advert for the women\u2019s game. </p> \n<p><strong>Fondest memory of France</strong> The consistent friendliness, politeness and helpfulness of virtually everyone I encountered. As someone who, bar the odd \u201c<em>Je suis d\u00e9sol\u00e9</em>\u201d, cannot speak French, that proved refreshingly stereotype-defying.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76515c6bd4c24fae353fe0f22dd8360101bf7a35\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76515c6bd4c24fae353fe0f22dd8360101bf7a35/0_87_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lucy Bronze scored England\u2019s third goal from long range against Norway.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lucy Bronze scored England\u2019s third goal from long range against Norway.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Suzanne Wrack</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Match of the tournament </strong>In terms of atmosphere it has to be France v USA at the Parc des Princes. La Marseillaise sung in full voice at the start was spine-tingling and it was fiery from start to finish. For the match itself? The final, purely because the Netherlands were really impressive at holding the champions at bay for as long as they did, having looked defensively shaky throughout.</p> \n<p><strong>Player of the tournament</strong> It is obviously Megan Rapinoe. Plenty of players had great World Cup tournaments but no one matches the on- and off\u2011the\u2011field all-rounder. Using the biggest stage in the world to speak out on the issues she cares about while juggling the pressure to perform that that brings? Incredible. Megan for president.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/08/fifa-var-womens-world-cup-uswnt-hope-solo\">Fifa's VAR bumbling hurt a World Cup in which the women's game shone | Hope Solo</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>Goal of the tournament</strong> Lucy Bronze\u2019s rocket against Norway. It was beautiful. Capping a great performance, the way Bronze waited alone on the edge of the box and powered it into the roof of the net was magical.</p> \n<p><strong>Personal highlight</strong> Too many to choose. The England press pack have been a fantastic bunch to work with, for one. The final week in Lyon was by far the highlight. I got to go beyond the World Cup and take part in the Equal Playing Field World Record five-a-side match (dragging a motley crew from Phil Neville\u2019s press conference to take part too) and then attending and moderating a session at EPF\u2019s Equality Summit \u2013 a packed room of stellar influential women in football discussing the game, changes, challenges and more? Absolutely buzzing.</p> \n<p><strong>Biggest disappointment</strong> France. They are experienced at hosting major tournaments but you could be forgiven for thinking this was their first time. There was little hype, at alleged sold-out matches \u2013 semi\u2011finals and final in particular \u2013 it was frustrating to see as many empty seats as there were. Staff were overzealous (they confiscated my water because it wasn\u2019t the right sponsor in close to 40C heat) and transport to and from stadiums was a nightmare.</p> \n<p><strong>Fondest memory of France</strong> Given the above \u2026 the fondest memories I will take from this tournament are of the people I was working with, the people I was socialising with, the brilliant Football Association communications team and the general playfulness of the England players.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"242cb6fa79c688b6d0e228fb7a4facc1ccf3cb19\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/242cb6fa79c688b6d0e228fb7a4facc1ccf3cb19/0_208_4642_2786/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Megan Rapinoe celebrates with the World Cup trophy, the Golden Boot and the trophy for best player in the tournament.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Megan Rapinoe celebrates with the World Cup trophy, the Golden Boot and the trophy for best player in the tournament.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BPI/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Richard Parkin</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Match of the tournament </strong>For pure momentum shifting it is hard to look past the Netherlands-Japan last-16 game. The Dutch started the first 30 minutes close to their imperious best but as the second half wore on the Japanese grew exponentially into the contest. Only another late VAR\u2011bacle could decide the match, one worthy of being played much later in the tournament.</p> \n<p><strong>Player of the tournament </strong>The big names and strikers often scoop the accolades at tournament\u2019s end, but it is the midfield metronomes who best determine their side\u2019s fortunes. When the USA are in trouble it\u2019s the pure tenacity of Julie Ertz that sets the tone, while for the Dutch Sherida Spitse has added four assists to a near flawless display of passing, tempo-control and tackling.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2019/jun/06/golden-boot-standings-top-scorers-for-france-2019-womens-world-cup\">Golden Boot Standings: top scorers for France 2019 World Cup</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>Goal of the tournament</strong> For team goal, Japan\u2019s against the Dutch \u2013 calm, clinical, creative. For feeling, Jamaica\u2019s first World Cup goal \u2013 Havana Solaun, only just off the bench, sent brilliantly through by Khadija Shaw and finishing with aplomb.</p> \n<p><strong>Personal highlight </strong>Amid the wreckage of Australia\u2019s Group C opening defeat rose the phoenix of one of the feelgood stories of the Women\u2019s World Cup: Italy. After a 20-year absence <em>Le Azzurre</em> announced their arrival in the women\u2019s game \u2013 passionate (Elena Linari\u2019s anthem belting), ruthless (Barbara Bonansea\u2019s cool tournament opener) and cultured (Aurora Galli\u2019s finish against China).</p> \n<p><strong>Biggest disappointment</strong> Germany. There were questions marks over this squad, and injury to the playmaker Dzsenifer Marozsan did not help. Riding their luck in game one as a pacy Chinese side comfortably got in behind should have been the canary in the coalmine, but then came that defensive showing against Sweden to blow the quarter-final.</p> \n<p><strong>Fondest memory of France</strong> After Australia\u2019s \u201cnightmare in Nice\u201d against Norway my tournament was in effect over. To watch in among the crowd, surrounded by 53,000+ others, a game of the intensity, quality and excitement of USA v England was to witness the pure potential of the women\u2019s game. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa24cd7805b5e2adbcd55beeefeb4456835dae8c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa24cd7805b5e2adbcd55beeefeb4456835dae8c/0_110_3606_2164/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wendie Renard scores for France in their quarter-final defeat to the USA in a game many felt would have been a fitting final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wendie Renard scores for France in their quarter-final defeat to the USA in a game many felt would have been a fitting final.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charlotte Wilson/Offside via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Kieran Pender</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Match of the tournament</strong> England\u2019s match against USA. The game had everything: great goals, VAR controversy, a missed penalty and a red card. But at its core the semi-final was a battle of two heavyweights playing some of the best football of the tournament.</p> \n<p><strong>Player of the tournament </strong>Who else but Megan Rapinoe? My respect for her grew tenfold when she fronted the press in the leadup to USA\u2019s blockbuster quarter-final with France. The Twitter spat with Donald Trump was threatening to overshadow the match but, rather than hide from the issue, Rapinoe pre-empted the first question: \u201cI\u2019ll just address it head on and then we can get to the soccer questions. I stand by the comments that I made about not wanting to go to the White House with the exception of the expletive. My mom will be very upset about that.\u201d All class.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/jul/08/womens-world-cup-inspiration-sport-participation\">Lionesses inspire us all but heroes alone cannot make a nation more sporty | Sean Ingle</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>Goal of the tournament</strong> It was perhaps not a goal for the ages but when Havana Solaun collected an incisive through-ball on the break before rounding the Australian goalkeeper Lydia Williams and slotting home, the joyous celebrations of the small contingent of Jamaica fans in Grenoble said everything. For this Caribbean island to reach the tournament against all odds and then score their first World Cup goal \u2013 moments such as that make these tournaments special.</p> \n<p><strong>Personal highlight </strong>This is my third major tournament covering my native Australia, having followed the Socceroos at the Confederations Cup and World Cup. In that time, I had yet to see my homeland win. Then, in a comeback for the ages, the Matildas scored three goals in the space of 20 minutes to defeat Brazil. Truly, the miracle in Montpellier.</p> \n<p><strong>Biggest disappointment </strong>While smaller host cities got into the World Cup spirit \u2013 Valenciennces deserves a shout-out for its abundant tournament signage \u2013 in the larger cities it was hardly obvious that a World Cup was being staged. </p> \n<p><strong>Fondest memory of France</strong> I feel privileged to have had a ringside seat to a tournament that will, I suspect, be remembered as an inflection point for women\u2019s football. The tournament has been far from perfect but over the past four weeks there has been a real sense among players, observers and fans of the significance of this tournament. In a world struggling to redress systemic gender inequality, the rise of women\u2019s football is a force for good. That \u2013 and the 21 croissants I consumed \u2013 will be my fond memories from France.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c700fb77f253459e86c29a83a51edab99749dc01\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c700fb77f253459e86c29a83a51edab99749dc01/148_370_2717_1630/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Havana Solaun (centre) celebrates after rounding Australia goalkeeper Lydia Williams to score Jamaica\u2019s first ever World Cup goal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Havana Solaun (centre) celebrates after rounding Australia goalkeeper Lydia Williams to score Jamaica\u2019s first ever World Cup goal.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Naomi Baker - FIFA/FIFA via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Sophie Lawson</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Match of the tournament</strong> Italy 0-1 Brazil in the group stage. From the matches I covered, I always seemed to be in the wrong place, watching the wrong 22 players as another match from the same day brought about 90 scintillating minutes of football as I was left with some dishwater. However, when Italy and Brazil clashed in Valenciennes, it was a rare treat to see both teams so enamoured and keen to attack.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/08/womens-world-cup-2019-usa-womens-team-victory\">USA carried social and sporting burdens at the World Cup.

The one-of-a-kind Swedish No 9 has been kicked up and down the pitches across France, running on fumes and driving ever forward for Bl\u00e5gult this tournament. Having matured an astounding amount between leaving and returning to the Swedish Damallsvenskan, this summer has seen Asllani remind the world just what\u2019s she\u2019s capable of. </p> \n<p><strong>Goal of the tournament</strong> After attending 21 matches, everything has unfortunately rather blurred together but Lana Clelland\u2019s belter against Japan sticks out. Just 12 minutes into her World Cup debut, the Scotland striker was left in space in front of the Japan box with time to pull back and put her laces through the ball. </p> \n<p><strong>Personal highlight</strong> After I arrived at my hotel in Nice only to be told they\u2019d given the room away, I popped up a frustrated tweet and immediately had 10 people message me offering to help. I was tired, sweaty and disgusting in every single way but in that moment I was overwhelmed by the kindness of the women\u2019s football community.</p> \n<p><strong>Biggest disappointment </strong>That almost at every match (before kick off or at half-time) the stadium announcers would encourage everyone in the stands to engage in a Mexican Wave. Wholly unnecessary.</p> \n<p><strong>Fondest memory of France </strong>When I finally got to say goodbye to the Murder Basement when I left Paris to travel down to Lyon.

Partly because in games where the US haven\u2019t looked as convincing as the standards they have set for themselves might demand, she\u2019s been the player to pull them through. But also for how, with her candidness and her determination to use her platform and profile to consistently draw attention to the contexts and issues which affect the women\u2019s game. So in that sense too she really has been the player of the tournament, a figure really transcending the sport.</p> \n<p><strong>Goal of the tournament</strong> Lucy Bronze v Norway. What a way to cap off a personal performance par excellence in that quarter final.</p> \n<p><strong>Personal highlight</strong> Seeing how this tournament has engaged people who ordinarily wouldn\u2019t have bothered with football, and has helped to reframe how they see the game. I got chatting to a bloke who, after hearing I was in France for the World Cup, started to reply with \u201cSpeaking as a man\u2026\u201d (I inhaled and braced myself for a potentially awkward interaction) \u201c\u2026who has previously had no interest in football at all because of the theatrics and nonsense in the men\u2019s game, I\u2019ve really enjoyed the last few weeks and have been making the effort to watch the games\u201d (I exhaled and relaxed into the conversation thereafter).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Biggest disappointment</strong> The difficulty of watching games if you couldn\u2019t be physically at the stadium, particularly for the early stages. Not having games on free-to-air TV, and the reticence of many bars in host cities to show games unless prompted, particularly in the group stages, made seeing some games unnecessarily difficult and gave off the feeling that the World Cup was being tolerated rather than embraced in the way that the men\u2019s tournament would be.</p> \n<p><strong>Fondest memory of France</strong> It\u2019s difficult to go beyond the camaraderie and generosity of spirit of the fan groups and football communities coming together. For New Zealand\u2019s opener against the Netherlands I found myself sitting in a very Netherlands-filled section of Stade Oc\u00e9ane; a lone Kiwi in an Oranje sea. No matter. \u201cIf you lose, you have some shoulders to cry on,\u201d one told me before kick off, and we commiserated at the final whistle.</p>",

It is no exaggeration to say that, without Scott, the Lionesses may not have reached the final four. Goal of the tournament Lucy Bronze v Norway. An imperious, unerring, first-time, 25-yard strike. The look on the watching David Beckham\u2019s face after he had admired its inexorable trajectory towards the top corner spoke volumes. Personal highlight A tie between a taxi driver who recognised me in Nice airport and rushed over saying \u201cBonjour madame\u201d and another in Paris who carried my case \u2013 at full gallop \u2013 to the correct station platform, enabling me to catch a train to Lyon with a minute to spare. Biggest disappointment Cameroon\u2019s appalling behaviour as they lost against England in a game which turned into high farce. It was comedic at times but also a truly dreadful, and depressing, advert for the women\u2019s game. Fondest memory of France The consistent friendliness, politeness and helpfulness of virtually everyone I encountered. As someone who, bar the odd \u201cJe suis d\u00e9sol\u00e9\u201d, cannot speak French, that proved refreshingly stereotype-defying. Suzanne Wrack Match of the tournament In terms of atmosphere it has to be France v USA at the Parc des Princes. La Marseillaise sung in full voice at the start was spine-tingling and it was fiery from start to finish. For the match itself? The final, purely because the Netherlands were really impressive at holding the champions at bay for as long as they did, having looked defensively shaky throughout. Player of the tournament It is obviously Megan Rapinoe. Plenty of players had great World Cup tournaments but no one matches the on- and off\u2011the\u2011field all-rounder. Using the biggest stage in the world to speak out on the issues she cares about while juggling the pressure to perform that that brings? Incredible. Megan for president. Goal of the tournament Lucy Bronze\u2019s rocket against Norway. It was beautiful. Capping a great performance, the way Bronze waited alone on the edge of the box and powered it into the roof of the net was magical. Personal highlight Too many to choose. The England press pack have been a fantastic bunch to work with, for one. The final week in Lyon was by far the highlight. I got to go beyond the World Cup and take part in the Equal Playing Field World Record five-a-side match (dragging a motley crew from Phil Neville\u2019s press conference to take part too) and then attending and moderating a session at EPF\u2019s Equality Summit \u2013 a packed room of stellar influential women in football discussing the game, changes, challenges and more? Absolutely buzzing. Biggest disappointment France. They are experienced at hosting major tournaments but you could be forgiven for thinking this was their first time. There was little hype, at alleged sold-out matches \u2013 semi\u2011finals and final in particular \u2013 it was frustrating to see as many empty seats as there were. Staff were overzealous (they confiscated my water because it wasn\u2019t the right sponsor in close to 40C heat) and transport to and from stadiums was a nightmare. Fondest memory of France Given the above \u2026 the fondest memories I will take from this tournament are of the people I was working with, the people I was socialising with, the brilliant Football Association communications team and the general playfulness of the England players. Richard Parkin Match of the tournament For pure momentum shifting it is hard to look past the Netherlands-Japan last-16 game. The Dutch started the first 30 minutes close to their imperious best but as the second half wore on the Japanese grew exponentially into the contest. Only another late VAR\u2011bacle could decide the match, one worthy of being played much later in the tournament. Player of the tournament The big names and strikers often scoop the accolades at tournament\u2019s end, but it is the midfield metronomes who best determine their side\u2019s fortunes. When the USA are in trouble it\u2019s the pure tenacity of Julie Ertz that sets the tone, while for the Dutch Sherida Spitse has added four assists to a near flawless display of passing, tempo-control and tackling. Goal of the tournament For team goal, Japan\u2019s against the Dutch \u2013 calm, clinical, creative. For feeling, Jamaica\u2019s first World Cup goal \u2013 Havana Solaun, only just off the bench, sent brilliantly through by Khadija Shaw and finishing with aplomb. Personal highlight Amid the wreckage of Australia\u2019s Group C opening defeat rose the phoenix of one of the feelgood stories of the Women\u2019s World Cup: Italy. After a 20-year absence Le Azzurre announced their arrival in the women\u2019s game \u2013 passionate (Elena Linari\u2019s anthem belting), ruthless (Barbara Bonansea\u2019s cool tournament opener) and cultured (Aurora Galli\u2019s finish against China). Biggest disappointment Germany. There were questions marks over this squad, and injury to the playmaker Dzsenifer Marozsan did not help. Riding their luck in game one as a pacy Chinese side comfortably got in behind should have been the canary in the coalmine, but then came that defensive showing against Sweden to blow the quarter-final. Fondest memory of France After Australia\u2019s \u201cnightmare in Nice\u201d against Norway my tournament was in effect over. To watch in among the crowd, surrounded by 53,000+ others, a game of the intensity, quality and excitement of USA v England was to witness the pure potential of the women\u2019s game. Kieran Pender Match of the tournament England\u2019s match against USA. The game had everything: great goals, VAR controversy, a missed penalty and a red card. But at its core the semi-final was a battle of two heavyweights playing some of the best football of the tournament. Player of the tournament Who else but Megan Rapinoe? My respect for her grew tenfold when she fronted the press in the leadup to USA\u2019s blockbuster quarter-final with France. The Twitter spat with Donald Trump was threatening to overshadow the match but, rather than hide from the issue, Rapinoe pre-empted the first question: \u201cI\u2019ll just address it head on and then we can get to the soccer questions. I stand by the comments that I made about not wanting to go to the White House with the exception of the expletive. My mom will be very upset about that.\u201d All class. Goal of the tournament It was perhaps not a goal for the ages but when Havana Solaun collected an incisive through-ball on the break before rounding the Australian goalkeeper Lydia Williams and slotting home, the joyous celebrations of the small contingent of Jamaica fans in Grenoble said everything. For this Caribbean island to reach the tournament against all odds and then score their first World Cup goal \u2013 moments such as that make these tournaments special. Personal highlight This is my third major tournament covering my native Australia, having followed the Socceroos at the Confederations Cup and World Cup. In that time, I had yet to see my homeland win. Then, in a comeback for the ages, the Matildas scored three goals in the space of 20 minutes to defeat Brazil. Truly, the miracle in Montpellier. Biggest disappointment While smaller host cities got into the World Cup spirit \u2013 Valenciennces deserves a shout-out for its abundant tournament signage \u2013 in the larger cities it was hardly obvious that a World Cup was being staged. Fondest memory of France I feel privileged to have had a ringside seat to a tournament that will, I suspect, be remembered as an inflection point for women\u2019s football. The tournament has been far from perfect but over the past four weeks there has been a real sense among players, observers and fans of the significance of this tournament. In a world struggling to redress systemic gender inequality, the rise of women\u2019s football is a force for good. That \u2013 and the 21 croissants I consumed \u2013 will be my fond memories from France. Sophie Lawson Match of the tournament Italy 0-1 Brazil in the group stage. From the matches I covered, I always seemed to be in the wrong place, watching the wrong 22 players as another match from the same day brought about 90 scintillating minutes of football as I was left with some dishwater. However, when Italy and Brazil clashed in Valenciennes, it was a rare treat to see both teams so enamoured and keen to attack. Player of the tournament Kosovare Asllani. The one-of-a-kind Swedish No 9 has been kicked up and down the pitches across France, running on fumes and driving ever forward for Bl\u00e5gult this tournament. Having matured an astounding amount between leaving and returning to the Swedish Damallsvenskan, this summer has seen Asllani remind the world just what\u2019s she\u2019s capable of. Goal of the tournament After attending 21 matches, everything has unfortunately rather blurred together but Lana Clelland\u2019s belter against Japan sticks out. Just 12 minutes into her World Cup debut, the Scotland striker was left in space in front of the Japan box with time to pull back and put her laces through the ball. Personal highlight After I arrived at my hotel in Nice only to be told they\u2019d given the room away, I popped up a frustrated tweet and immediately had 10 people message me offering to help. I was tired, sweaty and disgusting in every single way but in that moment I was overwhelmed by the kindness of the women\u2019s football community. Biggest disappointment That almost at every match (before kick off or at half-time) the stadium announcers would encourage everyone in the stands to engage in a Mexican Wave. Wholly unnecessary. Fondest memory of France When I finally got to say goodbye to the Murder Basement when I left Paris to travel down to Lyon. It will not be missed. Ella Reilly Match of the tournament The Brazil v Australia group stage game. With Australia desperately needing a result to keep their knockout stage aspirations alive coupled with the fermenting rivalry between the two sides, this game had everything: spikiness, a comeback victory and a dash of VAR controversy. Player of the tournament Megan Rapinoe. Partly because in games where the US haven\u2019t looked as convincing as the standards they have set for themselves might demand, she\u2019s been the player to pull them through. But also for how, with her candidness and her determination to use her platform and profile to consistently draw attention to the contexts and issues which affect the women\u2019s game. So in that sense too she really has been the player of the tournament, a figure really transcending the sport. Goal of the tournament Lucy Bronze v Norway. What a way to cap off a personal performance par excellence in that quarter final. Personal highlight Seeing how this tournament has engaged people who ordinarily wouldn\u2019t have bothered with football, and has helped to reframe how they see the game. I got chatting to a bloke who, after hearing I was in France for the World Cup, started to reply with \u201cSpeaking as a man\u2026\u201d (I inhaled and braced myself for a potentially awkward interaction) \u201c\u2026who has previously had no interest in football at all because of the theatrics and nonsense in the men\u2019s game, I\u2019ve really enjoyed the last few weeks and have been making the effort to watch the games\u201d (I exhaled and relaxed into the conversation thereafter). Biggest disappointment The difficulty of watching games if you couldn\u2019t be physically at the stadium, particularly for the early stages. Not having games on free-to-air TV, and the reticence of many bars in host cities to show games unless prompted, particularly in the group stages, made seeing some games unnecessarily difficult and gave off the feeling that the World Cup was being tolerated rather than embraced in the way that the men\u2019s tournament would be. Fondest memory of France It\u2019s difficult to go beyond the camaraderie and generosity of spirit of the fan groups and football communities coming together. For New Zealand\u2019s opener against the Netherlands I found myself sitting in a very Netherlands-filled section of Stade Oc\u00e9ane; a lone Kiwi in an Oranje sea. No matter. \u201cIf you lose, you have some shoulders to cry on,\u201d one told me before kick off, and we commiserated at the final whistle.",

Federer took the first set in 17 minutes and the whole thing lasted only one hour and 14 minutes. He will play the No 8 seed, Kei Nishikori of Japan, who beat the unseeded Kazakh Mikhail Kukushkin 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9c042396-627b-417b-8a50-d91196525ce9\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Novak Djokovic (1) v David Goffin (21)&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p><b>First match on Centre Court&nbsp;</b>The good news for Belgium\u2019s David Goffin as he prepares for his first ever Wimbledon quarter-final is that the last time he played Novak Djokovic, he beat him. The bad news is that defending champion Djokovic has won their other five matches and that one defeat, in 2017, was on clay when he had not yet rediscovered top form after surgery and a loss of motivation. Two years on, Djokovic is three wins away from joining an elite group of men to win the title five times. In many ways, Goffin\u2019s game is a mirror of Djokovic\u2019s; the problem is that the Serb is just a little bit better in every department.</p>\n    <p><b>Guido Pella (26) v Roberto Bautista Agut (23)&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p><b>First match on Court No 1 </b>Having taken out two of the biggest servers in the game, Kevin Anderson and Milos Raonic, Argentina\u2019s Guido Pella is the biggest surprise of the eight quarter-finalists, mainly because he had only won two matches in three previous visits to Wimbledon. The left-hander has broken into the top 30 this year but Bautista Agut is also playing the most consistent tennis of his life. Bautista Agut has also won both their previous meetings.</p>\n    <p><b>Sam Querrey v Rafael Nadal (3)&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p><b>Second match on Court No 1&nbsp;</b>This is Querrey\u2019s third time in the quarter-finals in the last four years and the big-serving American is more at ease on the Wimbledon grass than he is at any of the grand slam events. Laid-back and unassuming, Querrey is going under the radar yet again but Nadal will know the danger he faces, the American having beaten Novak Djokovic here in 2016 and Andy Murray in 2017. However, Nadal is playing arguably his best tennis at Wimbledon since he won his second Wimbledon title in 2010.</p>\n    <p><b>Kei Nishikori (8) v Roger Federer (2)&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p><b>Second match on Centre Court&nbsp;</b>Nishikori is into the quarter-finals here for the second straight year. He should take great confidence from the fact that he beat Federer when they last met, in the ATP Finals in London last November but Federer, even at 37, looks in supreme form. The Swiss won the only time they played on grass and so far this fortnight, he has shown no signs of slowing up.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The last quarter-final will be between Roberto Bautista Agut of Spain, who beat the Frenchman Beno\u00eet Paire 6-3, 7-5, 6-2, and Guido Pella.

      "bodyText": "The pharmaceutical company Johnson &amp; Johnson has a legal case to answer over accusations it drove the US opioid epidemic now claiming 130 lives a day, an Oklahoma judge has ruled. After a fiery hearing on Monday, with accusations of lying, Judge Thad Balkman dismissed a motion by the company to toss out a multi-billion dollar lawsuit by Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general. Balkman said the state has presented sufficient evidence for the trial to continue. The state has spent the past month laying out evidence alleging that Johnson &amp; Johnson played a leading role in creating the epidemic with marketing strategies that dangerously misrepresented the risk of opioid addiction to doctors, manipulated medical research and drove prescribing of high strength narcotics to patients who didn\u2019t need them. The Oklahoma ruling will bolster hundreds of other lawsuits in the pipeline against leading opioid makers, drug distributors and pharmacy chains by counties, cities and states across the US blighted by an epidemic estimated to have claimed more than 400,000 lives over the past two decades. On Monday, Johnson &amp; Johnson argued that Oklahoma\u2019s attempt to sue it under a public nuisance statute was wrong because the law was intended to address problems such as property disputes. The company\u2019s lawyer, Stephen Brody, argued that if the state were to prevail, then public nuisance laws could be used to make McDonald\u2019s pay for the obesity crisis, gun manufacturers for shootings, and the oil industry for climate change. Brody also said Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s promotion of opioids was protected by the first amendment and the supreme court\u2019s landmark Citizens United ruling, which prevents the government from restricting corporate spending on political advertising. Brody added that the state failed to prove that Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s opioid subsidiary, Janssen, played any role in causing the epidemic because its drugs were only a fraction of the market. The state\u2019s lawyer, Brad Beckworth, was visibly angry as he repeatedly accused the company of lying.

      "bodyText": "Labour is poised to declare it will campaign for remain in a second referendum on any deal put to parliament by a Conservative prime minister, after trade union leaders including Unite\u2019s Len McCluskey backed a change of policy. The joint position agreed by the unions on Monday would not commit Labour to an explicitly pro-remain position in all circumstances: unions also agreed Labour should seek to deliver a Brexit deal if the party won an election before the UK left the EU. That Labour deal would also be put to a public vote, but the party would not commit to campaigning for remain against its own Brexit deal, throwing into doubt what Labour would offer in any snap election manifesto. One senior shadow cabinet source described it as a significant win for remain campaigners, despite the potential lack of clarity. \u201cUnions have backed a referendum on any deal this parliament and Labour campaigning for remain \u2013 that\u2019s a big victory. What\u2019s in a manifesto is a debate for another day,\u201d the source said. Barring any major intervention, the surprise consensus among trade unions including Unite, GMB, Unison, Aslef and Usdaw is likely to force any remaining sceptics to agree to the new position when the shadow cabinet meets on Tuesday. Several shadow cabinet sources said the policy had the hallmarks of being approved by the Labour leader\u2019s office and said it \u201cwould not be watered down\u201d \u2013 though some shadow ministers are likely to push for an even stronger position. Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, who has regularly clashed with Jeremy Corbyn over the party\u2019s Brexit position, tweeted: \u201cRemain is who we are. Our values are remain, our hearts are remain. Today is a step in the right direction but members and supporters are clear that any kind of Brexit gives us less than we have now and Labour should not support it.\u201d Union leaders had met on Monday to agree a common position on Labour\u2019s Brexit policy, in a meeting one source described as fractious but ultimately consensual. The proposed policy, which will be offered to the Labour leadership as the unanimous view of the unions, will say: Labour will campaign for a second referendum in all circumstances and will campaign for remaining in the EU against a Tory prime minister\u2019s Brexit deal and in order to stop no deal. Should Labour win a general election before Brexit, Labour would negotiate its own Brexit deal and then hold a referendum with remain on the ballot paper \u2013 but the party should not specify whether it would back remain in those circumstances. A senior Labour source said Corbyn had not been present at the meeting but suggested it was a helpful outcome. \u201cJeremy has been working to unite the party and the wider Labour movement around a common position,\u201d the source said. Union sources close to the talks said they did not want the position to be presented as an out-and-out victory for remain campaigners, saying the party would still have a chance to tell leave voters it would honour the result of the 2016 referendum by negotiating a Brexit deal if in government. \u201cUltimately everybody just wants this to end,\u201d one union source said. \u201cIt would be an error to let this drag on until conference and have the battle on the conference floor.

A briefing war has erupted over the past few weeks as some shadow cabinet ministers suggested senior Corbyn aides and union figures such as McCluskey were preventing the party moving to an explicitly pro-remain position or championing the change in party policy. On Sunday, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, denied claims he had been urging Corbyn to sack his two most senior aides, Karie Murphy and Seumas Milne, because they were opposed to Labour committing to backing remain in a second referendum. Labour had already shifted its Brexit stance to propose that any Brexit deal passed by parliament should be put to the people in a second referendum, after the party suffered heavy losses to the pro-remain Liberal Democrats at the local and European elections. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, had previously said publicly she was \u201cbeginning to worry\u201d about party policy not being sufficiently pro-remain. Labour MPs at a private meeting of parliamentarians on Monday night expressed some caution about the new policy. \u201cIt is not exactly the absolute clarity we were hoping for,\u201d one MP said. \u201cIt sounds like we are reserving the right to campaign for remain against our own Brexit deal \u2013 that will just sound ludicrous to voters.\u201d The party came under attack for the policy from both sides of the Brexit divide as the trade union agreement emerged.

But after Jack Libby fell for a painstaking 77, Leach and Bess discovered zip and Notts lost seven for 40. It was Bess\u2019s first five-fer this season, in only his second match back at <strong>Somerset</strong> since returning from a loan spell with Yorkshire.</p> <p><strong>Essex</strong> were on top at Chelmsford after trimming <strong>Yorkshire</strong> to 38 for three thanks to two wickets in 10 balls from Peter Siddle. Adam Lyth then dropped anchor to be top scorer with nine off 57 balls. Earlier, Ryan ten Doeschate ushered Essex to a first-innings lead of 120, with an unbeaten 70.</p> <p><strong>Kent</strong> battled gamely at the Oval to give themselves a slender lead of 14. Joe Denly made a steady 88 before being Morkeled with the new ball. Earlier <strong>Surrey</strong> had secured agreement from Kent to substitute Amar Virdi for the ill Gareth Batty, but the idea was scuppered by ECB regulations.</p> <p><strong>Hampshire</strong> set <strong>Warwickshire</strong> 404 to win after a century from Warwicks\u2019 Sam Hain, but Kyle Abbott sent any hopes spinning with a volcanic three for 18.</p> <p>At Northwood, Toby Roland Jones gladdened hearts with career-best bowling figures of seven for 52 against <strong>Gloucestershire</strong> after a wretched season. But the former <strong>Middlesex</strong> player Ryan Higgins kept the visitors in the game with an unbeaten 61 and three for 16 in the hosts\u2019 second innings.</p> <p>Alex Davies rescued <strong>Lancashire</strong> from calamity at Wantage Road with an unbeaten 124, his first century of the season. From two for two \u2013 ducks for Keaton Jennings and Haseeb Hameed \u2013 he nurdled Lancashire towards respectability. Earlier, <strong>Northamptonshire</strong> had made 442 \u2013 but too slowly for maximum batting points.

Bad weather disrupted <strong>Surrey\u2019s</strong> game with Kent- Ben Foakes finished 57 not out. </p> <p>In Division Two, <strong>Worcester</strong> and <strong>Derby</strong> had a shocker, both bowled out for less than 115, with four wickets apiece for Charlie Morris and Luis Reece; <strong>Northants</strong> made easy work of <strong>Lancashire\u2019s</strong> Mahmood, Onions and Gleeson, with CCLive favourite Keaton Jennings also bowling two overs. Temba Bavuma made 103, his first Championship century. <strong>Middlesex</strong> were bowled out cheaply by <strong>Gloucestershire</strong>, who were 59-2 at the close; <strong>Leicester</strong> made short work of <strong>Durham\u2019s</strong> batting, out for 117 - five wickets for Chris Wright - and have a lead of seven with four wickets in hand. </p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "At Taunton, Dom Bess and Jack Leach whistled through what had seemed a promising Nottinghamshire batting performance in the battle between Division One\u2019s top and bottom counties. The visitors had cruised to 201 for two, even surviving the retirement of Chris Nash \u2013 hit on the helmet by Jamie Overton on 50. But after Jack Libby fell for a painstaking 77, Leach and Bess discovered zip and Notts lost seven for 40. It was Bess\u2019s first five-fer this season, in only his second match back at Somerset since returning from a loan spell with Yorkshire. Essex were on top at Chelmsford after trimming Yorkshire to 38 for three thanks to two wickets in 10 balls from Peter Siddle. Adam Lyth then dropped anchor to be top scorer with nine off 57 balls. Earlier, Ryan ten Doeschate ushered Essex to a first-innings lead of 120, with an unbeaten 70. Kent battled gamely at the Oval to give themselves a slender lead of 14. Joe Denly made a steady 88 before being Morkeled with the new ball. Earlier Surrey had secured agreement from Kent to substitute Amar Virdi for the ill Gareth Batty, but the idea was scuppered by ECB regulations. Hampshire set Warwickshire 404 to win after a century from Warwicks\u2019 Sam Hain, but Kyle Abbott sent any hopes spinning with a volcanic three for 18. At Northwood, Toby Roland Jones gladdened hearts with career-best bowling figures of seven for 52 against Gloucestershire after a wretched season. But the former Middlesex player Ryan Higgins kept the visitors in the game with an unbeaten 61 and three for 16 in the hosts\u2019 second innings. Alex Davies rescued Lancashire from calamity at Wantage Road with an unbeaten 124, his first century of the season. From two for two \u2013 ducks for Keaton Jennings and Haseeb Hameed \u2013 he nurdled Lancashire towards respectability. Earlier, Northamptonshire had made 442 \u2013 but too slowly for maximum batting points. Graham Onions took five for 77 as Lancashire failed for the first time this season to gather maximum bowling points. Durham played their joker at Grace Road. After being bowled out for 113 on Sunday, they advanced to 191 for one in their second innings, thanks to a Cameron Bancroft century. In between they took the remaining six Leicestershire wickets for 82 as Chris Rushworth rattled through the tail. Tom Lace, on loan to Derbyshire for the season from Middlesex, made a hundred as Derby built up a sizeable first-innings lead against Worcestershire on a flattening Kidderminster pitch. A compelling day of cricket that, and good to see that Notts can still pull it out of the bag - they had me worried for a moment. A first five-fer of the year for young Dom Bess, a career best for Toby Roland Jones, an up-yours wiggle from Ryan Higgins and late evening collapses by Warwickshire and Essex. Plus centuries of importance for different reasons for Cameron Bancroft, Tom Lace, Sam Hain and Alex Davies. Have a lovely evening and I\u2019ll see you tomorrow. Good night! I\u2019ll leave you for a time ,while i write up, with the news that Yorkshire are 19 for two. Peter Siddle has bowled two overs and has two for five. Just realised I didn\u2019t chose the caption competition winner, but it turns out Krikkit wasn\u2019t far off with: \u201cAustralian players mistake coach\u2019s intentions after he says pre semi-final team meeting will be a chance for the players to bear their souls.\u201d Here is a little tale about it all. \u201cYou get a feel of the grass on your feet, a bit of grounding, the positive and negative energy flowing through and coming out of the Earth.\u201d Right on baby! I love it when the Aussies get mystical. Now Moores goes, for one! Its so good to have Leach and Bess in the wickets again. Oh, and Patterson-White too...Leach 3-67. Notts 226 for 6, one hundred behind and a man out injured. Sam Northeast and Aneurin Donald have added 44 after Hampshire lost four for six before tea. Hants 100-4. Oliver Hannon-Dalby 3-29. OOOOh - Leach gete Libby for 72 after a 192-ball epic. Well played. I\u2019m not feeling a Notts up from here - my money\u2019s on Leach and Bess to plug away...Nash, incidentally, hasn\u2019t come back in. Still no breakthrough for Somerset, with Notts 196-2. The same goes for Yorkshire, still unable to dislodge ten Doeschate and Beard as the evening session progresses. And what a start for Warwickshire as they try to keep Hampshire in reach. Hampshire are 64-4 at tea, with Oliver Hannon-Dalby taking three. Sam Northeast is still in, battling to keep that average looking healthy. Gloucestershire were all out for 201, with Toby Roland-Jones taking seven wickets. Bowled. Middlesex have edged into the lead in that one, 39 without loss at Northwood. Durham were all out for 117 in their first innings; they\u2019re already 89-0 in their second, Cam Bancroft and Alex Lees both racing to 40+ runs in short order. At Chelmsford, Essex are edging their way to a decent first-innings lead. Ryan ten Doeschate and Aaron Beard have taken their ninth-wicket partnership past 50, and Essex lead by 96. Warwickshire all out 307 and Hampshire batting again are 37 for 0. Lancashire recovering 59-2. Zak Crawley out for 69, but Kent 113-2 and on top against Surrey. I\u2019ve just checked - Sam Northeast has scored 720 runs and is averaging 60. Hmmm. Not sure how my mind successfully erased that from my data banks. This Notts -138/1 v the Championship leaders - is what Notts looked like on paper at the start of the season. Duckett has just smashed Jack Leach for six! Graham probably put this up yesterday, apologies if so, but this is the Lions squad for the game against Australia A starting on Sunday. Northeast and Duckett are the only ones who don\u2019t spring immediately to mind as having had great seasons. James Bracey (Gloucestershire) Zak Crawley (Kent) Ben Duckett (Nottinghamshire) Ben Foakes (Surrey) Lewis Gregory (Somerset) Jack Leach (Somerset) Saqib Mahmood (Lancashire) Sam Northeast (Hampshire) Jamie Porter (Essex) Ollie Robinson (Sussex) Dom Sibley (Warwickshire) Warwickshire, 300 for 9, likely to be following-on shortly. And Madsen (51) and Lace (30) finding batting easy against Worcestershire at Wantage Road:131-2. Glad to see Dillon Pennington back - I though he looked a real prospect last season. In other news, one of my brothers has sent me a picture of some blackberries he found growing in London. In July? Shurely shome mishtake? And a triple-Rushworth has finished off Leicestershire - all out with a lead of 95 over Durham. Can Cam Ban nurdle and nudge Durham into a lead that their bowlers can work with? Currently 11/0 in the second innings. And a sixth for Toby Roland Jones! Gloucestershire 145-8. Lancashire 2 for 2. Hameed for a duck, also to Sanderson. Please tell me he didn\u2019t leave it...no, he edged it onto his stumps. (phew) Chris Nash retiring hurt on 50 at Taunton, after being hit on the head by Jamie Overton. Been sent off by the physio. Jack Libby\u2019s first CC fifty of the season, and now Chris Nash joins him Notts: 120/1 Lancashire 2/1. Keaton Jennings edges Sanderson to second slip for a most unfortunate duck. Rushworth takes a third at Grace Road, Leicestershire 206 for 8, a lead of 89. Lancashire 0-0. Kent and Notts still finding batting easy in the post-prandial window. Reports from Taunton tell of nothing in the wicket for the bowlers - Leach and Bess could be in for some heavy-duty turns. Disappointment after lunch for Tom Westley, lbw to one that didn\u2019t bounce as much as he expected from Olivier. Out for 81. Essex 208 for five, and scores are level. Division One Day three Ageas Bowl: Hampshire 539 (Holland 143, Donald 173; Stone 5-93) v Warwickshire 270-8 (Hain 112 not out) Day two Chelmsford: Essex 193-4 (Westley 79 not out) v Yorkshire 208 (Harmer 5-76) Taunton: Somerset 326 (Davies 74; Wood 4-85) v Notts 91-1 The Oval: Surrey 271-9dec (Elgar 63, Foakes 60) v Kent 68-1 Division Two Grace Road: Leicestershire 191-7 (Horton 50, Ackermann 57 not out; Raine 4-45) v Durham 117 (Wright 5-30) Merchant Taylors\u2019: Middlesex 172 (Shaw 4-33) v Gloucestershire 122-6 (Roland-Jones 5-30) Wantage Road: Northamptonshire 442 (Bavuma 103; Onions 5-77) v Lancashire Kidderminster: Worcestershire 113 (Reece 4-30) v Derbyshire 108 (Morris 4-26) and 96-2. An interesting tweet. Just trying to look up the regs. I think counties can play one overseas player not qualified for England in CC and one-day comps, but have four registered for T20s, playing two at any time. Sound right? I\u2019ve just discovered a new toy: if you run your cursor very slowly along the clip of Sam Curran\u2019s wicket you can create your very own slow-mo replay. The fielders and bowler were practically embracing before Dickson could bear to turn round and survey the damage. Notts 85/1 shock!!!!! Arghgh! Sorry all, and thanks to those BTL for pointing it out, Northants did NOT get full batting points, as they dawdled for too long over the necessary runs. After squeezing three days into seven hours yesterday, they\u2019re elongating time and space at Kidderminster... 65 runs and a couple of wickets. Derby 85 for 2 a lead of 80. Sean Dickson might be replaying this in his head tonight. Sam Curran nips in with an early wicket -Sean Dickson for one. Kent 40-1. Northants closing in on full batting points against Lancashire, despite Graham Onions five-fer: your local solicitors Procter and Buck holding up the mighty Lancs. And Northants, in the time it took me to write that, have done it: 402 for 8. And a hundred for Warwickshire\u2019s Sam Hain . Bloody great to see some some different names having up days. Good times: Let them leave you up in the air/Let them brush your rock and roll hair. FIVE wickets for Toby Roland-Jones! That makes me very happy. His last two years a thorough battle against adversity. Gloucestershire 87 for five. Ok, so no-one at Surrey or Kent had read the small print. ECB competition regulations forbid Amar Virdi replacing Gareth Batty, so Batty bats on in spirit, but not in person. Hence the Surrey declaration. It all seems a bit of a slog at Chelmsford, where Essex have scored 35 runs this morning. Meanwhile Notts are teetering on the edge of respectability: 46 for one. Here are some Australians barefoot and in a circle. Caption competition BTL. Durham fighting back against Leicestershire - four wickets for Ben Raine. Leicestershire 151 for six. Surrey have declared: 271 for nine! Notts stutter -an early wicket for Jamie Overton. Slater for 15. Notts 36 for one. Surrey lose a couple of early wickets. Ben Foakes for 60; Rikki Clarke for 27. In other news, Gareth Batty has been taken ill overnight at The Oval and Amar Virdi has replaced him for the rest of the match. And this from Gary Naylor: This is a lovely piece by Emma John. And another! This time Richard Gleeson. Northants 334 for 7. And Notts have made a good start! Libby and Slater, plugging away: 11-0. An early wicket for Onions - Rossington for 76. Now four for 67. Good morning! The bad news is that it is Monday, the good news is that County Cricket gets its little moment in the sun today. No World Cup games - New Zealand v India is tomorrow at Old Trafford and England vAustralia on Thursday at Edgbaston - no Women\u2019s Ashes, just on the side Australia A\u2019s men and women playing Sussex and England Academy women respectively. So let\u2019s stir the pot. Hampshire and Warwickshire are a day ahead of everyone else - they start day three today, with Warwickshire recovering well from losing Sibley and Rhodes early. In the rest of the Division One Games, Simon Harmer\u2019s five wickets put Essex in a good position against Yorkshire, especially if Tom Westley can push on from his 52 not out; Dom Bess and Steve Davies\u2019 runs at the last rescued Somerset against a Notts side who fought hard - let\u2019s see how they do with the bat this morning. Bad weather disrupted Surrey\u2019s game with Kent- Ben Foakes finished 57 not out. In Division Two, Worcester and Derby had a shocker, both bowled out for less than 115, with four wickets apiece for Charlie Morris and Luis Reece; Northants made easy work of Lancashire\u2019s Mahmood, Onions and Gleeson, with CCLive favourite Keaton Jennings also bowling two overs. Temba Bavuma made 103, his first Championship century. Middlesex were bowled out cheaply by Gloucestershire, who were 59-2 at the close; Leicester made short work of Durham\u2019s batting, out for 117 - five wickets for Chris Wright - and have a lead of seven with four wickets in hand.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson will have to embark on a whistlestop charm offensive meeting EU leaders over the summer to try to secure an emergency Brexit summit in September if he is serious about avoiding no deal, according to Whitehall sources who have been involved in negotiations. The senior sources said Johnson, if he becomes prime minister, would immediately need to pull out the stops over parliament\u2019s summer holiday with a round of diplomacy with senior politicians in Europe. He may even need to consider recalling parliament early if he is to achieve the new deal he claims to want. At the same time, they said, he would need to ramp up preparations for a no-deal Brexit, with small businesses currently complacent about the risks of this outcome. One senior source who has been involved in talks with Brussels said there were signs there could be some willingness to compromise, but Johnson could not afford to wait until a planned summit in October, weeks before the UK is due to leave. Another source \u2013 a political ally of Johnson \u2013 said it would need to be established \u201cextremely quickly\u201d over the summer whether there was enough appetite among European leaders for finding a solution that could satisfy both Dublin and London. Johnson\u2019s campaign played down the need for such a course of action, but the Tory hopeful has not yet publicly set out how he hopes to achieve a Brexit deal in his first 100 days in No 10. He has claimed that the chances of a no-deal Brexit are \u201ca million to one\u201d, but his only public strategy so far is to threaten to withhold the \u00a339bn that the UK has agreed to pay the EU in order to secure a new agreement. Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, will head to Brussels on Tuesday for meetings with Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, to scope out the areas where there might be a willingness to compromise under a new prime minister. Barclay, an early supporter of Johnson for the top job, has repeatedly argued in cabinet in recent weeks that spending on no-deal preparations needed to be increased. Johnson\u2019s team favour leaving the EU on 31 October with some sort of standstill agreement during which a new deal and trading relationship can be negotiated. He would be willing to continue paying into the EU budget during this period. However, this has repeatedly been rejected by Brussels, with the European commission saying Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal is the only one on offer and that there will be no transitional period if there is no deal. Meanwhile, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, is pushing for Conservatives to be given a free vote on a parliamentary move to stop Johnson as prime minister suspending parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit. Hammond is trying to persuade May that she should lift the whip on certain amendments aimed at preventing the House of Commons being denied a say on whether the UK leaves on 31 October without a deal. Dominic Grieve, a Conservative MP and former attorney general, is leading a cross-party effort to prevent a no-deal Brexit with amendments to the Northern Ireland bill, but it is not certain of passing if the government whips against it. Hammond\u2019s best leverage is that he still holds the purse strings as May seeks \u00a327bn of extra education spending as part of her legacy before leaving Downing Street in a fortnight\u2019s time. It is understood that discussions are ongoing over the education spending, and Hammond may be willing to sign off \u00a35bn for the next year, but he believes May\u2019s successor should make the decision about levels of cash for schools after that. The Times reported that he was making spending on education conditional on May allowing a free vote on the prorogation amendments. Grieve, supported by opposition parties and a handful of pro-EU Conservatives, laid an amendment to Northern Ireland legislation on Monday that would stop parliament being prorogued in the autumn to achieve a no-deal Brexit. He told Sky News he hoped to \u201cpersuade my colleagues that I think this bill provides a vehicle by which we can ensure the prorogation of parliament can\u2019t happen\u201d. He said: \u201cI think that the chances of a prime minister carrying out a no-deal Brexit if there is a majority of the House of Commons that doesn\u2019t want it are very slim indeed. And removing the possibility of prorogation makes them even slimmer. \u201cObviously, if a prime minister can persuade the House of Commons that a no-deal Brexit is a good idea, he\u2019s fully within his rights to do it.

      "bodyText": "Iran has enriched uranium beyond the key limit dictated in its 2015 deal with major powers, in the latest escalation of the crisis between Washington and Tehran. The move, confirmed by the UN\u2019s nuclear watchdog, came amid hints from Iran that it could start enriching to 20% later in the year unless it secured European help in the face of crippling US sanctions. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the body tasked with verifying Iranian compliance, said on Monday that Iran had breached the 3.67% enrichment limit, a move previously flagged by Tehran. A spokesman for the organisation said its director general, Yukiya Amano, had informed the IAEA board of governors that agency inspectors had verified on Monday that Iran was \u201cenriching uranium above 3.67% U-235\u201d. The agency, in a report to member states, said it had verified the enrichment level using online enrichment monitors and samples had also been taken on Monday for analysis. The confirmation that Iran is enriching beyond the agreed limits is the second major breach of the stipulations of 2015 joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA) after it was confirmed last week that Iran had also exceeded the agreed size of its stockpile of uranium. The latest breach came as the French president, Emmanuel Macron, announced he was sending his top diplomatic adviser to Iran to try to help defuse tensions. China, another signatory to the deal, accused the US of \u201cbullying\u201d Tehran with economic sanctions. The latest moves come amid mounting military tensions between the US and Iran that nudged close to outright hostility before Donald Trump last month cancelled airstrikes drawn up in response to the shooting down of a US drone. That followed a series of attacks on oil tankers in May and June that the US and UK blamed on Tehran. The crisis over the nuclear deal has deepened as Washington has imposed sanctions eliminating the benefits Iran was meant to enjoy in return for agreeing to curbs on its nuclear programme, following the Trump administration\u2019s withdrawal from the deal a year ago. The latest breach comes ahead of a specially convened meeting of the IAEA, called by the US for Wednesday to discuss the crisis. Tehran last week accused the US of being the major violator of the treaty because of its unilateral withdrawal from the deal. Semi-official news agencies in Iran had earlier reported that the country began enriching uranium on Monday to 4.5%, breaking the limit set four years ago. While the IAEA did not specify how much beyond the threshold Iran had gone, uranium enriched to 90% is considered weapons-grade, and the enrichment is far below this level. The Isna and Fars news agencies separately quoted Behrouz Kamalvandi, the spokesman of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, saying the decision to further enrich met the needs that Iran had now. \u201cFor now, we don\u2019t need 20%,\u201d Kamalvandi said in an interview with Iran\u2019s state broadcaster. \u201cBut if we do, since we have already exceeded 3.67%, we have no limitations or obstacles to do so.\u201d The Iranian moves had been anticipated by diplomats and analysts who argued that the country was likely to break conditions of the JCPOA as part of its pushback against the Trump administration\u2019s policy of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d and to put pressure on Europe. Iran has set its own 60-day deadline for saving the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which it said would expire in September. Enriching uranium up to 20% would be significant, returning Iran\u2019s stockpiles to the level of enrichment that existed before the JCPOA. Iran\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman, Abbas Mousavi, said on Monday that if European nations \u201cdo not fulfil their commitments seriously and do not do anything more than talk, Iran\u2019s third step will be harder, more steadfast and somehow stunning\u201d.",

I\u2019ll be back for the women\u2019s quarter-finals tomorrow. Bye! At 15-0 Federer produces a gorgeous volley. It\u2019s just insulting. Soon he has three match points. He takes the first with some serve-volley. All wrapped up in 74 minutes. He\u2019s through to the last eight and awaits the winner of Kei Nishikori versus Mikhail Kukushkin - that one\u2019s gone to a fourth set. Matteo Berrettini makes sure he won\u2019t suffer a bagel in this third set and he allows himself a little celebration. They all count. But Roger Federer responds by racing through his next service game. He leads 6-1, 6-2, 5-1. Milos Raonic just served for the match on Court 3. Guido Pella just broke back. He\u2019ll serve to stay in it at 4-5 in the fourth set. Meanwhile a Federer drifts over the net, lands on the line and dies a death, completely duping Berrettini, who slips and falls over. Federer holds up his hands after breaking to lead 6-1, 6-2, 3-0. Berrettini\u2019s laughing as he sits down. That sums it all up. Matteo Berrettini\u2019s doing it for all of those who want to go and have dinner soon. Facing three break points, he crushes a forehand into the corner. Federer goes for a defensive lob. Berrettini kneels down and gently cushions a volley into the net for no apparent reason. Federer leads by two sets and a break. A Mexican Wave on Centre Court. It\u2019s all you need to know. Matteo Berrettini should join in. He\u2019s not offered anything else. The procession continues on a flat Centre Court. Matteo Berrettini slaps a preposterous forehand long and Roger Federer leads 6-1, 6-2. This is intensely boring. Kei Nishikori goes a break up in the third set against Mikhail Kukushkin. He\u2019s serving to restore his lead. Matteo Berrettini drags a forehand wide and Roger Federer breaks to lead 6-1, 2-1. \u201cIt\u2019s about this time every year I have a mini Federer-based crisis of confidence,\u201d Matt Dony says. \u201cPeople have been saying that he\u2019s too old for years, but he just keeps going, keeps winning, and keeps playing insanely beautiful tennis. He\u2019s two weeks older than me. The constant talk of his age makes me feel old, and his continued success makes me feel hopelessly inadequate. The man is a marvel.\u201d Guido Pella\u2019s won that third set against Milos Raonic, taking it 6-3. Raonic leads 6-3, 6-4, 3-6. Pella beat Cilic from two sets down last year. After 17 minutes Roger Federer swings an ace down the middle to wrap up the first set 6-1. Matteo Berrettini won eight points in that set. Federer won 93% on his first serve. The young Swiss is looking good. Matteo Berrettini\u2019s already in choppy waters. Roger Federer leads 4-1 in the first set on Centre Court. Guido Pella took out Kevin Anderson, last year\u2019s beaten finalist, in the third round. He also beaten Marin Cilic, the beaten finalist in 2017, in last year\u2019s second round. Now, quirkily enough, he is playing Milos Raonic, the beaten finalist in 2016. Ho hum! Raonic took the first two sets, but Pella is 5-2 up in the third. Kei Nishikori didn\u2019t drop a set in the first set, but he has dropped one now. Mikhail Kukushkin, the indefatigable Kazakh, has levelled their match on Court 2. Now on Centre Court: Roger Federer and Matteo Berrettini, the 17th seed. The Italian has a big serve and lots of power. Federer has lots of Federer. Just nipped off to get an apple. I return to see that Novak Djokovic has snoozed through a 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 win over Ugo Humbert. He plays David Goffin in the last eight. Elsewhere Novak Djokovic leads by two sets and a break against Ugo Humbert on Court 1. Milos Raonic is two sets up against Guido Pella. Kei Nishikori is a set up against Mikhail Kukushkin. Tight, scrappy, up and down, and she almost blew it in the end - but Johanna Konta probably deserves this win. She just had more nerve than Petra Kvitova, who wasn\u2019t quite there today. So it\u2019s Konta who\u2019s through to the last eight for the second time in three years. And what a chance she has - she plays another Czech, the unseeded Barbora Strycova. This time Konta begins well - or rather Kvitova tamely nets a forehand for 15-0. But then Kvitova crouches down to crack a backhand crosscourt for 15-all. The Czech is not going quietly. Yet a good serve from Konta forces Kvitova to send a backhand long. That\u2019s what she needs. 30-15. Then a ball stays low and Kvitova, stooping down, nets a slice. Two match points - and at the end of a tense rally, with Konta on the defensive, Kvitova sends a final forehand long! Third set: Konta 4-6, 6-2, 5-4 Kvitova* (*denotes server): Kvitova, of course, has to serve to stay in it again. She begins by staying stout at the net, punching an overhead for 15-0. Then she wallops a forehand down the line. Soon it\u2019s 40-0. Kvitova looks really engaged now. She cushions a beautiful volley away to hold to love. Centre Court is very anxious now. It\u2019s three straight games for Kvitova, the two-time champion. Konta will serve for it again and I\u2019m worried she might be about to implode. That was a flat game from her and a lively one from Kvitova. Third set: Konta* 4-6, 6-2, 5-3 Kvitova (*denotes server): So here\u2019s Johanna Konta serving for a place in the last eight. Surely she can\u2019t blow it from here. But there\u2019s work to do when Kvitova wins the first point. But two good serves take Konta to 30-15. Then she produces a stinker of a drop shot for 30-all. Encouraged by that, Kvitova clobbers a forehand from left to right for a break point. She probably needs to take this. But Konta does just enough, assertiveness at the net forcing Kvitova to drag a desperate forehand wide for deuce. But then she double-faults. But Kvitova nets a backhand return. It\u2019s been that kind of day for the Czech. She\u2019s hanging on, though, and has another chance when Konta lifts a backhand long. This time she chops a slice long. Ouch. Soon Konta has a match point. But she plonks a forehand wide. Deuce. Then Konta earns a second match point with a gorgeous drop shot. Then she sends a forehand long. It\u2019s edgy. Kvitova has a third break point when Konta clips a backhand wide. And this time, after more than 10 minutes, Konta lofts a backhand long. Oh dear. What next? Third set: Konta 4-6, 6-2, 5-2 Kvitova* (*denotes server): Serving to stay in the match, Kvitova begins by dumping a drop shot into the net for 0-15. She wins the next three points, though. She holds with an ace. Third set: Konta* 4-6, 6-2, 5-1 Kvitova (*denotes server): A bit of doubt creeps in, a couple of scratchy shots handing Kvitova two break points. Deep hitting from Konta saves the first. Kvitova nets a forehand pass on the second. Deuce. From there Konta holds. She\u2019s a game from the last eight. Kvitova simply hasn\u2019t been ruthless enough. Third set: Konta 4-6, 6-2, 4-1 Kvitova* (*denotes server): Kvitova is desperately trying to gee herself up, but the errors are piling up and another one hands Konta her latest break point. If she breaks here we can probably call it. And a huge backhand return does the job. Kvitova can only find the net with a weak backhand. Third set: Konta* 4-6, 6-2, 3-1 Kvitova (*denotes server): Looking to consolidate the break, Konta begins with an ace for 15-0. But 30-0 becomes 30-all, at which point Kvitova steps in, swinging those forehands and earning a break point. Yet a superb second serve from Konta makes Kvitova stretch and hook a forehand long for deuce. These are pivotal moments. Two more strong serves are enough for Konta to hold. Seriously impressive. Third set: Konta 4-6, 6-2, 2-1 Kvitova* (*denotes server): A blocked low return from Konta draws an error from Kvitova for 0-15. Konta dominates the next rally as well and wins it when Kvitova nets a backhand for 0-30. Kvitova takes the next point, though. She wipes her forehead. This is a tough match. Then she bangs an ace down the middle for 30-all. The game goes to deuce after a double-fault from Kvitova. Konta spies an opportunity: she steps in and slaps a backhand into the corner for a break point. Konta decides to go big again. She crunches a backhand from left to right and Kvitova\u2019s blown away. It\u2019s called out - but a challenge confirms it was on the line and Konta lands the first break! Third set: Konta* 4-6, 6-2, 1-1 Kvitova (*denotes server): Konta holds to 15. Third set: Konta 4-6, 6-2, 0-1 Kvitova* (*denotes server): After a quick break Kvitova returns to Centre Court with a steely look in her eye - a sign she\u2019s ready for what promises to be a hard-fought deciding set. She holds to love and bellows furiously. Beware. Konta is finally ready to resume. Let\u2019s hope her ankle isn\u2019t bothering her too much. Serving for the set, the game goes to 15-all. Then a good body serve jams Kvitova up; 30-15. She follows that with one down the middle and that\u2019s enough for two set points. An ace out wide is enough for the set. All very routine. And rather excellent too. Elsewhere Novak Djokovic goes a set up against Ugo Humbert. And the world continues to turn. Before Johanna Konta serves for the set, she receives medical treatment. She is having strapping applied to her left ankle. Second set: Konta 4-6, 5-2 Kvitova* (*denotes server): Kvitova is serving to stay in the set. She moves into a 40-15 lead, but she lets it fizzle out, the game drifting to deuce, and Konta clenches her fist after nailing a backhand for a set point. But Kvitova comes up with a pounding serve. Kvitova holds. Second set: Konta* 4-6, 5-1 Kvitova (*denotes server): Now it\u2019s Konta\u2019s turn to wobble, slack shots giving Kvitova a 0-30 lead. But Konta gets it back to 15-30 and she gets away with it when a useless lob is met with a useless volley by Kvitova, who could have done anything she wanted with that. From there she holds to 30. Second set: Konta 4-6, 4-1 Kvitova* (*denotes server): Kvitova\u2019s in a bit of a funk now. The game goes to deuce. She looks low, in need of something to spark her. But she holds after clobbering a forehand volley into the open court. Elsewhere Karolina Muchova has beaten Karolina Pliskova, the third seed, 4-6, 7-5, 13-11! It finished on a lucky net cord for Muchova. Oh Karolina! And also - oh Karolina! Second set: Konta* 4-6, 4-0 Kvitova (*denotes server): Konta\u2019s annoyed after a bit of confusion over a challenge, but she moves into a 40-0 lead and ends up holding to 15. Second set: Konta 4-6, 3-0 Kvitova* (*denotes server): Disappointed after failing to break, Kvitova makes a couple of poor errors to fall into a 0-30 deficit. After another tight shot Konta has two break points. Kvitova saves the first, but not the second, and Konta has the double break. Second set: Konta* 4-6, 2-0 Kvitova (*denotes server): Konta looks to be in command at 30-all, but two errors give Kvitova hope and the Czech earns a break point with a crushing forehand return. Konta saves it nervelessly, though, dinking carefully and volleying well for deuce. Kvitova hits back, fearsome hitting bringing up another break point, but a good serve from Konta forces the Czech to net a forehand return. It turns into a marathon game. Konta\u2019s struggling to polish it off. She\u2019s wasting chances. But eventually, after seven deuce points and two aces, she takes one and consolidates the break. Second set: Konta 4-6, 1-0 Kvitova* (*denotes server): Hello, I\u2019ve just scooted over from the Coco Gauff game-by-game, and I return to see that Konta has made a good start to this set, breaking straight away. That\u2019s a fine response after that abysmal forehand on set point. Konta* 4-6 Kvitova (* denotes server) The pressure moves to Konta and after losing the opening point she does well to stay in the second point and eventually win it after being put on the back foot by a screeching Kvitova groundstroke. The pair trade blows for 30-30 before Konta sends a forehand long. It\u2019s set point for Kvitova. Konta\u2019s first serve down the middle narrowly misses the line and Kvitova attacks the second. Konta cannot handle the power and she\u2019s lost the first set. And with that I\u2019ll hand back to Jacob. Rafael Nadal is in scintillating form, and here\u2019s the evidence. Read Simon Cambers\u2019 report \u2026 Konta 4-5 Kvitova* (* denotes server) Konta forces a couple of errors from Kvitova to go 0-30 up. A long rally ends with the Briton putting a backhand into the net but a great return forces another error. It\u2019s 15-40 and two break points to Konta. Tow big sliced serves render her helpless though and it\u2019s deuce. Konta only just misses with a return and then Kvitova forces another error to hold her serve. She lets out a huge roar. She showed guts there. Konta* 4-4 Kvitova (* denotes server) This is like a men\u2019s match, so dominant is the serving. It\u2019s impressive tennis from both players. Konta takes control of the game with three unreturnable serves and a wild return from Kvitova is miles out to seal the game. We\u2019re all level again. Now is crunch time. Konta 3-4 Kvitova* (* denotes server) Kvitova is really playing well. Fifteen winners already attest to that and her forehand is ramming home the opportunities afforded by her wickedly sliced serves. Another emphatic hold for the Czech. Konta* 3-3 Kvitova* (* denotes server) The longer rallies are on Konta\u2019s serve and Kvitova is hitting more winners offf the ground. Two brutal forehands bring her back to 30-30 and give her the sniff of a break. Konta finds a big serve to earn game point and then a lovely drop shot has Kvitova scrambling and unable to stay in the game. We\u2019re level. Konta 2-3 Kvitova* (* denotes server) Konta is failing to make an impression on her opponent\u2019s serve. The slice and accuracy are running Konta ragged and Kvitova unleashes two aces to take the game to 15. Konta* 2-2 Kvitova (* denotes server) Kvitova climbs into the second serve of Konta to power a return winner down the line. Is there a chink of an opening here? Konta\u2019s serve is working fluidly and she races to 40-15 with three big ones. The first double fault of the match interrupts her flow and Kvitova slams a cross-court backhand past her opponent to force deuce. But two more big serves rescue the Briton and it\u2019s all square 13 minutes in. Konta 1-2 Kvitova* (* denotes server) Kvitova sends Konta one way then the other with two fine swinging serves to go 30-0 up. Konta manages to return one but a drilled forehand from Kvitova is far too good. Finally Konta gets a return at the feet of Kvitova to force a loopy half-volley but the Briton\u2019s attempted pass hits the net. Konta* 1-1 Kvitova (* denotes server) Konta\u2019s serve is on song from the first point. Kvitova can hardly land a racket on anything in the game and they\u2019re level. These points are going to be short. Konta 0-1 Kvitova* (* denotes server) A lucky net cord gives Konta the opening point of the match against the Kvitova serve but the Czech puts her foot down with some powerful serving and two scorching winners. First blood to Kvitova. Next up on Centre Court is Johanna Konta v Petra Kvitova, and we\u2019ll be moving to game by game coverage of this one. Britain\u2019s No 1 up against a two-times Wimbledon champion. This could be a classic. \u201cIt was a good solid match I think, \u201c says Nadal. \u201cIt\u2019s true that the service probably didn\u2019t work as good as two days ago but the other things were very positive. Good forehand, good backhand and some good volleys too. I\u2019m back in the quarter-finals and happy to be there. Last year was a great year, I was very close to winning another title and here I am again.\u201d A typically powerful service game to love closes out a crushing win and no one will want to come up against this juggernaut. Can anyone stop Nadal? Not on this form. A whipped cross-court winner leaves Sousa chuntering at the umpire but that\u2019s another break. The Spaniard is 5-2 up and serving for the match after less than two hours. Jo\u00e3o Sousa is playing his best tennis of the match but Nadal is on another planet. It\u2019s been some time since he looked this good on grass and a sublime touch volley closes out another service game. He\u2019s only made 10 unforced errors so far. Utterly ruthless. Nadal leads 4-2 in the third. Fernando Verdasco has taken the second set 6-2 to level the match against the No 21 seed David Goffin. Two well matched players going toe to toe on No 3 Court. Halep v Gauff is a humdinger if ever there was one, but both have been broken in their opening service games. Follow it live with Jacb Steinberg here \u2026 This is the moment Serena Williams reached her 14th Wimbledon singles quarter-final \u2026 Rafael Nadal breaks Jo\u00e3o Sousa\u2019s serve to go 2-1 up in the third. This is a rout. Sousa hasn\u2019t had a single break point. Muchova wins the second set 7-5 to level the match. Some fine play from the underdog gets her to deuce before a 115mph second serve ace from Pliskova seems to have closed the door. A double fault reopens it before Muchova uses her touch to earn a set point. She then forces an error from her compatriot to take the set. The N0 3 seed looks in trouble having started so powerfully. Karolina Muchova is ranked no 68 in the world but she is fighting hard against Karolina Pliskova on No 2 court. She holds to 30 to go 6-5 up in the second set and has a chance to put pressure on the former world No 1\u2019s serve. Rafael Nadal wins the second set 6-2 and is making short work of Jo\u00e3o Sousa. The Portuguese fought back brilliantly against Dan Evans in the previous round but things are looking very ominous here. That was mighty impressive. The seven-times Wimbledon champions is through to the quarter-finals where she will face Alison Riske, conqueror of Ashleigh Barty. Serena Wiliams is one game from victory. A scorching backhand cross-court winner cuts short S\u00e1nchez Navarro\u2019s mini-revival to put the American 5-2 up in the second set. She\u2019s serving for the match. I\u2019m going over to cover Simona Halep versus The Kid. Rob Bleaney will take over this blog. Serena Williams drills a backhand down the line and breaks again to lead 6-2, 3-0. It\u2019s a right gubbing on Court 1. Roberto Bautista Agut, a decent sort, takes the first set 6-3 against Benoit Paire. Consistency is winning the day on Court 18. Rafael Nadal, the big old meanie, breaks Joao Sousa in the first game of the second set on Centre Court. The Spaniard leads 6-2, 1-0. As does Serena Williams. She\u2019s thoroughly outplaying Carla Suarez Navarro on Court 1. Serving for the first set, Serena Williams saves two break points, earns a set point when Carla Suarez Navarro spoons a backhand wide and takes it when the Spaniard spins a slice long. Williams takes the first set 6-2. Karolina Pliskova, who\u2019s looking increasingly dangerous this fortnight, takes the first set 6-4 against Karolina Muchova in the all-Czech tussle on Court 2. It\u2019s surprising that the No3 seed has never been past the fourth round here. Serena Williams breaks again. She leads 5-2. Elsewhere a rampant Rafa Nadal has won the first set 6-2 against Joao Sousa. Round the courts we go. Barbora Strycova was relentless as she roared back from a set down to beat Elise Mertens, the 21st seed, 4-6, 7-5, 6-2, earning her a quarter-final against Johanna Konta or Petra Kvitova. On Court 2 Karolina Pliskova is trying to break Karolina Muchova as they head deep into the first set. Roberto Bautista Agut and Benoit Paire are feeling each other out on Court 18. And there\u2019s been no sign of a break between David Goffin and Fernando Verdasco on Court 3. Serena Williams, no doubt buoyed by Ashleigh Barty\u2019s exit, appears to be on it. A stooping, flicked backhand past a stunned Suarez Navarro takes the breath away. It forces deuce in the fifth game of the first set. But Suarez Navarra responds well and closes the game with a pinpoint forehand to trail 3-2. Joao Sousa sends a backhand wide and drops his serve for the second time. Rafael Nadal leads 3-0. Zzzz. Serena Williams isn\u2019t just Andy Murray\u2019s dance partner. No, no, no. Apparently she\u2019s also very good in the women\u2019s singles! Will let you know more on that when I do some research. And this Williams hopeful has only gone and broken Carla Suarez Navarro in the first game on Court 1. Elsewhere Rafael Nadal has gone a break up against Joao Sousa. Showtime Steinberg - that\u2019s actually my kid\u2019s name. Anyway the stars have arrived. Rafael Nadal against Joao Sousa, conqueror of a devastated Dan Evans, on Centre Court. Serena Williams against the tough Spaniard, Carla Suarez Navarro, on Court 1. Quite the streak from Barbora Strycova out on Court 12. The Czech veteran was 6-4, 5-2 down to Elise Mertens, but has won the last eight games to lead in the deciding set. China\u2019s Zhang Shuai is through to the quarter-finals; she\u2019s beaten Dayana Yastremska 6-4, 1-6, 6-2 and will pay Simona Halep or Coco Gauff next. And with that, I\u2019ll hand you back to Jacob \u2018Showtime\u2019 Steinberg as the show courts get under way ... The No 8 seed gets the job done against Martic, who was hampered by injury. \u201cI played really good, Petra was struggling a little bit physically in the second set. I was moving well, and feeling good today,\u201d says the Ukrainian. It\u2019ll be her first Wimbledon quarter-final, too. That was a terrific performance from the world No 89, who next faces either Serena Williams or Carla Su\u00e1rez-Navarro. So probably Serena, then. It\u2019s her first grand slam singles quarter-final appearance, but you wouldn\u2019t know it from the way she closed that out. Here\u2019s Alison Riske\u2019s reaction: \u201cI\u2019m so excited, and so proud of myself for the way I\u2019ve handled matches here. I\u2019ve been ready to battle in every match. I couldn\u2019t begin to say what Wimbledon means to me. Getting to the quarter-finals is amazing, but just the way I\u2019ve been fighting is the best thing for me. But the last eight at Wimbledon, that\u2019s not too bad.\u201d Alison Riske has already put out two seeds \u2013 Donna Vekic and Belinda Bencic \u2013 in three-set thriller. Can she send the No 1 seed home? There\u2019s a hint of a wobble with an unforced error, but a monster forehand finds the line. 30-all, and an ace brings up match point ... and Barty sends a shot wide. That\u2019s it! The world No 1 is out! Barty in bother again on her own serve, double-faulting on her way to 15-30 down. She finds a second serve down the middle, then a 111mph first serve, and closes out with an ace. Three-all, and perhaps she can put those first-serve issues behind her now. On No 3 Court, Svitolina is closing in against Martic, who is still struggling with her movement. The No 8 seed is 4-0 up in the second set. Barty holds despite some more suspect first serves, then carves out a break point on the Riske serve. The American defends well, darting around the court to keep the deciding set on serve. Thanks Jacob, and hello everyone. Barty is in a real battle here, 2-1 down on serve in the final set. Over on No 3 Court, Petra Martic is having a lengthy medical timeout after struggling badly on her own serve. It looks like a hip problem. She\u2019s 6-4, 1-0 down to Svitolina. I\u2019m going to take a quick break for lunch before the big guns enter the fray on Centre Court and Court 1. Niall McVeigh will take over for a bit. What a turnaround on Court 2. Serving to stay in the second set, Ash Barty finds herself down a set point. She isn\u2019t serving well. She\u2019s only serving at 47%. She tries to force the issue with a charge to the net, but Alison Riske picks herself off with a forehand down the line and takes it 6-2. They\u2019re going into a decider. The world No 1 is in a funk. Elina Svitolina has found a way to deal with Petra Martic\u2019s unpredictable game. She saves a break point to hold for 4-4. Then she breaks for 5-4. Then she serves out to love to win the first set 6-4. Not bad from the eighth seed. Alison Riske is solid. She\u2019s still causing Ashleigh Barty a few problems with her baseline power on Court 2 and breaks to 15 to lead 3-1 in the second set. Will Barty be dragged into a third set? It\u2019s tough to predict which way it will go on Court 12. Elise Mertens has fought back from a break down to win the first set 6-4 against Barbora Strycova. But Strycova is a break up in the second. The biggest attraction today: Petra Martic\u2019s drop shot. Shuai Zhang of China clenches a fist and walks back to her chair with the first set in the bag. She\u2019s taken it 6-4 against Dayana Yastremska. That piece of Martic outrageousness distracted me from Ash Barty breaking again to lead 5-3 against Alison Riske. She\u2019s serving for the set. She races into a 40-0 lead. She takes it when an awkward bouncer of a second serve forces Riske to hook a backhand return off target. Petra Martic breaks back with an outrageous piece of impudence - get this, she just took a break point by returning a serve with a backhand drop shot. The audacity! Elina Svitolina was dumbfounded. 3-3 in the third set on Court 3. An opportunity opens up for Alison Riske, two break points materialising in the seventh game of the first set. Ashleigh Barty suddenly finds a little more weight behind the American\u2019s shots hard to handle and she drops her serve with a wild forehand. Barty leads 4-3 and Riske has done well to get back in the set. On Court 3 it\u2019s Elina Svitolina who lands the first blow, breaking Petra Martic for a 3-2 lead. While on Court 12 it\u2019a Barbora Strycova who leads against Elise Mertens. Ashleigh Barty just has so much variety. She has a way of turning a slice into a winner. It\u2019s so very good to watch. She does so to earn two break points and doesn\u2019t take long to convert for a 3-1 lead on Court 2. Shuai Zhang, boosted by a good win over Caroline Wozniacki, leads by an early break against Dayana Yastremska, a Ukrainian teenager. Elsewhere it\u2019s all very tight. The sparring stages. Alison Riske isn\u2019t an opponent to take lightly. The unseeded American fought back from set down to beat Belinda Bencic on Saturday. However you suspect Ash Barty will be too strong. She\u2019s looked unstoppable so far. And indeed she begins with a love hold on Court 2, sealing the game with an ace. Play has started on Court 3. Elina Svitolina, the eighth seed, faces Petra Martic, the 24th. Could be interesting. Martic is a dangerous, clever player. Elsewhere Elise Mertens meets Barbora Strycova on Court 12. The players are out on court. First up on Court 2 it\u2019s world No 1 Ashleigh Barty against the USA\u2019s Alison Riske. It\u2019s not the first time Barty\u2019s been on Court 2. What\u2019s up with that? I doubt you\u2019ll see Djokovic, Nadal or Federer on Court 2. COCOMANIA Before we begin Hello. There\u2019s Rafael Nadal against Joao Sousa, Roger Federer against Matteo Berrettini, Johanna Konta against Petra Kvitova, Novak Djokovic against Ugo Humbert, Serena Williams against Carla Suarez Navarro and all of this is irrelevant because Cori Gauff, the undisputed star of these championships, is playing Simona Halep, the seventh seed, in the second match on Court 1. It\u2019s Manic Monday, the most frantic day of any Wimbledon, with everyone in action on both sides of the draw, but this time it\u2019s all about Coco Mania. Can the 15-year-old keep it going? Can she find a way against Halep, the brilliant little Romanian counter-puncher? It\u2019s going to be fascinating finding out. Play begins on the outside courts at 11am.",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me. Mali were excellent for 50 minutes and really should have taken control of the game in this period. But they didn\u2019t, and then they allowed Wilf Zaha to score a defensively monstrous goal, and so they lost. Bye! So Ivory Coast will return to Suez on Thursday to play Algeria in the quarter-finals, with the winner of that game to face the winner of the Nigeria v South Africa match in the final four. Mali had precisely twice as many shots as their opponents (14-7), but their finishing was poor. All their best performers were on the wing, and not doing the shooting. 90+4 mins: The game ends with players arguing about whether there was or wasn\u2019t a push, and whether there should or shouldn\u2019t be a free-kick, and who should take it, and from where. Eventually the referee gives up on convincing them to get on with it, and blows for time. 90+4 mins: The referee spots some kind of push, and Ivory Coast will end the game with a free kick of their own. 90+4 mins: Time\u2019s up, but Mali have one last free kick, from the right-hand corner of the penalty area. 90+3 mins: Save! One of the Adama Traores gets down the right and pulls back, but the shot that follows is too close to the keeper! 90+2 mins: There will be three minutes of stoppage time, of which only one remains. 90+1 mins: It\u2019s curled in and lands on Coulibaly\u2019s head, but he can\u2019t direct it on target. It\u2019s then sent back in, and Seri does brilliantly to roar back into the picture as Marega chests down, to deny the Malian striker another opportunity to disappointingly fail to score. 90 mins: The final seconds of the game, and Mali have another corner. 89 mins: In the last few minutes the referee has come to the conclusion that any contact between two players must deserve a free kick. The game is thus petering out amid a storm of refereeing whistles. 88 mins: Mali win a corner, and this time Gbohouo comes out, jumps high and claims cleanly. 85 mins: The Ivory Coast bring on Bony, replacing Kodjia. 84 mins: Hamari Traore\u2019s cross from the right is speeding, dipping, and just a yard or two too long. 83 mins: Bagayoko takes an age over a throw-in, from which Kessie wins a free-kick. It\u2019s suddenly stoppage city. 82 mins: Mali are now playing with a flat back four, a flat front four, and a very busy midfield two. 79 mins: Kalifa Coulibaly has come on in place of Lassana Coulibaly, very much a like-for-like swap. And there is the goal! And it\u2019s an absolute defensive horrorshow! Gbohouo takes a free kick deep inside his own half, and it is missed the defender, bounces over Kon and through to Zaha, who sidefoots past the advancing but poorly positioned Diarra! 73 mins: The game could do with a goal now. The wind has left Mali\u2019s sails and it\u2019s getting a bit boggy in midfield. 71 mins: Another looping through-ball towards Kodjia, but this time Diarra doesn\u2019t fall over, and claims easily enough. 69 mins: Ivory Coast take off Pepe and bring on Cornet. 67 mins: What a chance for the Ivory Coast and Kodjia! It\u2019s a simple ball over the top, and when Diarra, the Mali goalkeeper, falls over, it looks like a simple finish. But Kodjia doesn\u2019t seem confident, and Diarra gets in the way of his shot! 65 mins: Bagayoko commits another foul on Djenepo, and though the referee refrains from booking him he probably should have done, and the defender must now be hanging out in the proverbial last chance saloon. 63 mins: Another Mali substitution, and again they bring on Adama Traore. They had two of them, and now both are on the pitch. This one is the Cercle Brugge midfielder. 62 mins: Bagayoko is booked for shoving Djenepo, who falls over and rolls around a lot, and Mali have a dangerous free-kick on the left. 58 mins: The Ivory Coast are enjoying their best period of the match. No great chances so far, but they are enjoying a bit of territorial advantage. 55 mins: Half a chance for Ivory Coast! Pepe\u2019s 20-yarder deflects over the bar, and from the corner Kodjia half-volleys wide. 54 mins: Mali make the first substitution of the day, bringing Adama Traor\u00e9 on for Diaby. The Ivory Coast defence has been struggling against pace, and now there\u2019s more of it. 52 mins: Chance for Mali! Marega plays in Djenepo this time. Bagayoko falls over, giving him a free run on goal, and he advances on Gbohouo before, just as a goal appeared inevitable, getting confused and falling over. 50 mins: No sign yet that Ivory Coast have woken up at half-time. Mali continue to appear the only side with any idea how to win this game, or even to attack. 46 mins: Kanon gets in a muddle, the ball ricocheting off both of his legs and to a Malian player, who plays in Diaby on the right. Kanon is very fortunate that it ends with just a corner, and that said corner is entirely harmless. 46 mins: Peeeeeeep! Mali get half No2 started. Both teams are now back out. A big 45 minutes awaits. The Mali players are gathering in the tunnel ahead of the second half. No sign yet of the Ivorians, which very much follows the first-half pattern.. Hi, Simon here, back again. Sorry about the temporary loss of updates. As miffed as I am with my recalcitrant computer Mali will be more miffed not to be going in at least a goal to the good. It\u2019s been an impressive opening half from them, with Djenepo outstanding on the left and Traor\u00e9 also good on the right. Marega, unfortunately has not brought his shooting boots. Ivory Coast really have done very little goal-bothering. Marega is almost played in, but is flagged offside. And that\u2019s half-time. Mali on top, but no goals yet. 45 mins: Zaha gets crowded off the ball and has a little kick out at the defender. He wants to be careful. One added minute ... 42 mins: A drop of the shoulder from Djenepo, who then feeds Marega. The Porto forward shoots from a tight angle, finding only the side netting. 39 mins: Apologies \u2013 my TV feed cut out unexpectedly. It\u2019s been one of those days. Kodjia tries to find room in the Mali area, but is closed down. Prediction \u2013 this first half will end goalless. 35 mins: Ouch, this looks nasty. Ivory Coast centre-back Wilfried Konan contests a high ball and clatters into Diarra in the Mali goal. The defender goes down, and his teammates rush the medical team on. The stretcher is out, but Konan gets up and looks set to carry on. Worrying, given he looked to be out cold. 32 mins: Moussa Djenepo, the winger signed by Southampton over the summer, has caused plenty of trouble for Ivory Coast, who have struggled to get out of their half in the last few minutes. 28 mins: Mali have been the more attacking side, and Kon\u00e9 has a go from the edge of the area, but blazes it over the bar. 26 mins: Niall McVeigh here \u2013 just jumping in as Simon has some technical issues. 14 mins: Ivory Coast have so far relied on long balls. This doesn\u2019t seem a hopeless tactic: Pepe runs clear in pursuit of the latest, but it\u2019s overhit and collected by Diarra. 11 mins: Mali are looking quite bright in attack, and Marega leads their latest push forwards. It\u2019s a fine move, but rather than going for goal he tries to set up Coulibaly, which is where it all goes wrong. A minute earlier Djenepo ran down the left, before overhitting a pull-back, which his team-mate couldn\u2019t control. 7 mins: Half a chance for Zaha, who runs onto a poor defensive header, cuts inside onto his right foot and has a shot, but two Mali defenders fling themselves into the ball\u2019s path, and it hits the first of them. 5 mins: Shot! It\u2019s Mali with the first pop on goal, Kone blasting a 40-yard free-kick goalwards. It flicks Pepe on its way through, and is struck with some venom, but it\u2019s far enough from goal for Gbohouo to gather easily. 3 mins: Ivory Coast have had most of the early possession, but haven\u2019t done a lot with it. 1 min: Peeeeep! They\u2019re off! Ivory coast, all in white, get the game started. All set and ready to roll. Deep breath now. Excellent update, this. Mali\u2019s team are absolutely abysmal singers. In all my years of watching international football, I think this is a new low. The players are on their way out! Action is but a couple of anthems away! A reminder that there will be no VAR today (but there will be from the quarter-finals onwards): The teams are in! And these are today\u2019s starting line-ups: Mali: Diarra, Traor\u00e9, Kon\u00e9, Wagu\u00e9, Fofana, Haidara, Samassekou, Coulibaly, Djenepo, Diaby, Marega. Ivory Coast: Gbohouo, Coulibaly, Gbamin, Mamadou, Kanon, Kessi\u00e9, Serey Die, Zaha, Pepe, Kodjia. Ivory Coast have no such issues, with every shirt pleasingly hung and what appears to be an extremely generous fruit basket on the central table. This footage from inside the Mali dressing room shows how a dearth of hangers has led to wildly excessive shirt-draping: A quarter-final against Algeria is at stake for Mali and Ivory Coast. Both won two of their three group-stage games; the Ivorians lost the third and came second to Morocco in Group D; Mali drew with Tunisia but still won Group E at a canter. Ibrahim Kamara, the Ivory Coast coach, has an iron grip on the implications of this game: \u201cWe know that if we don\u2019t win, we\u2019re out,\u201d he said. And never a truer word was spoken. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to be focused because any mistake could cost a lot,\u201d he added. Ivory Coast won the tournament in 2015, and in 1992 for that matter.

      "bodyText": "As Coco Gauff\u2019s Wimbledon dream drew to an agonising close, the chants rang out. \u201cWe are proud of you, say we are proud of you,\u201d filled the air of the Paradise Sports Lounge in Delray Beach, the drinking establishment owned by her father, Corey. Family and friends packed this little spot in a typical Florida strip mall hoping to witness another landmark moment in Gauff\u2019s meteoric rise. Paradise has never seen anything quite like it. Indeed, it\u2019s normally closed on a Monday. Yet here we were, at 9am and with the sun already blazing, as more than 100 people crammed in, giddy with excitement and hope. Perhaps it was the mimosas and breakfast burritos kindly donated by Lee Cohen, a local lawyer who was aghast to learn nothing special had been organised for Gauff\u2019s latest monumental moment. \u201cI called her aunt on Sunday night and told her we had to do something,\u201d he said. Coffee, breakfast fare and something a little stronger were all on offer with Aunty Joi Grant running the show, thanking everyone profusely for giving up their Monday mornings for the chance to witness something truly special. Family members, led by Coco\u2019s grandmother, Yvonne Odom, packed a top table while locals and assorted others gazed up at the action being beamed in from London. With some of the family originating from New Orleans, good luck beads were handed out. \u201cI have been wearing them for every round,\u201d said Daisy Odom-Fulton, a great aunt. \u201cBut there\u2019s also someone high above looking out for Coco.\u201d Seven news crews had set up shop, keeping an eager eye on events while photographers fixed attention on her excitable grandmother, who whooped and cheered with every point won from Gauff\u2019s racket. Her 11-year-old brother, Cody, excitedly shook a cowbell. \u201cThe attention she is getting is crazy,\u201d he said.

Gauff was visibly nervous early on as Halep, the former world No 1, began to assert herself and broke in the opening game. Paradise, however, continued to keep the faith. \u201cYou go girl,\u201d roared Yvonne as her granddaughter began to show signs of life. The first set slipped away but hope flickered. After all, Gauff had so memorably recovered from a set down in the previous round against Polona Hercog. \u201cLook what happened last time,\u201d said another great aunt, Brenda Lee\u2011Williams, watching on nervously. Another break by the Romanian came at the start of the second but Gauff, who arrived at Wimbledon ranked 313 in the world but will now rise into the top 150, fought back and began to ask the former French Open champion some questions. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what she is doing out there,\u201d beamed her former mentor Dennis Murray. \u201cWhat a learning experience for her.\u201d It was, however, not to be.

It was so perfect for the song. And also, just how cool \u2013 I can probably die now because the two Pauls have been a part of this song.\u201d</p> <p>For fans who have been following Plum since she was barely out of high school, the album, titled Better in Blak \u2013 a collection of plainspoken, sparkling pop songs and naked acoustic ballads <strong>\u2013</strong> has been a long time coming.

The first song she ever recorded \u2013 \u201cthe first one I really took seriously\u201d \u2013 was Father Said, a haunting, assured minute-fifty that she uploaded to Triple J\u2019s Unearthed platform in 2012. It won her the title of the best unsigned Indigenous artist in the country, and a spot performing at the National Indigenous Music Awards, and \u201cit all started from there\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I can probably die now because the two Pauls have been a part of this song.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019d finished school and I was just playing lots of gigs \u2013 as many as I could around Brisbane in cafes and bars.

I just think I needed to go through what I\u2019ve been through, my life experiences in the last couple of years, to be able to come up with these songs.\u201d</p> <p>The starkest example might be the album\u2019s title track, Better in Blak. When she released it as a single in April, she<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bw29h4eltu1/\"> posted on Instagram</a> about its origins: she\u2019d been in the studio in London in May 2018, when her phone began \u201cblowing up\u201d with dozens of messages and comments, mostly containing abuse and slurs both racist and misogynist.</p> <p>It was an ugly second wind of an old battle back home, sparked in 2016 by a private Facebook post from her about an alleged altercation in a Sydney pub with a member of another band. Screenshots of that post were picked up by local music press, and she became a flashpoint for fans furious at the dent in the band\u2019s reputation.</p> <p>Now another public post, not from her, reignited the fight, and sent a further chorus of voices to her social media channels \u2013 and some of the band\u2019s angry fans to her shows, which she says has led her to sometimes feel unsafe.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It took me a little bit longer to figure out how to love myself.

I wanted to just delete all of my social media and become invisible to everyone. It was pretty hard and shitty. But then, this song kind of came from that. Sometimes bad things can open a space to create something that\u2019s not bad.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExMjEwymQ3A\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ExMjEwymQ3A?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Plum is a refreshingly straightforward lyricist. The songs on Better in Blak are direct, raw, and often funny: from Do You Ever Get So Sad You Can\u2019t Breathe and Love &amp; War (written with Gang of Youths\u2019 David Le\u2019aupepe as a response to the Don Dale scandal) to the scathing Woke Blokes and the reworked teen angst of the song Nick Cave, a track Plum wrote years ago after a twisted-up teenage heartbreak that led her to pretend that she, like him, was a vegan \u2013 when she was extremely not. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/07/miranda-tapsell-on-diversity-that-get-krackn-episode-and-play-schools-new-indigenous-doll\">Miranda Tapsell on diversity, that Get Krack!n episode and Play School's new Indigenous doll</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cOne time we were out at an event and someone came around with antipastos and I, literally, out loud said, \u2018Fuck yeah, prosciutto\u2019,\u201d she explains. \u201cHe was like \u2018Thelma, that\u2019s meat,\u2019 and I was like \u2013\u201d [adopting a look of horrified confusion] \u201c\u2018What?

It was from the producer David Kahne, who was in the studio in New York where the pair were working on her debut album, and it said, \u201cYou\u2019ll never guess what happened.\u201d Another artist in the studio had wandered past, overheard Plum\u2019s Paul Kelly-featuring song Made For You, and asked if he could \u201clay something down\u201d, explaining: \u201cI\u2019ve got this part that I can hear.\u201d It would be a bit of an overstep unless you were, say, a Beatle. So that\u2019s how a song that was already a career bucket-list item for a Paul Kelly superfan also scored a guest appearance by Paul McCartney on guitar. \u201cI definitely didn\u2019t guess that,\u201d Plum deadpans, eyes wide. \u201cIt\u2019s this beautiful, simple guitar line. It was so perfect for the song. And also, just how cool \u2013 I can probably die now because the two Pauls have been a part of this song.\u201d For fans who have been following Plum since she was barely out of high school, the album, titled Better in Blak \u2013 a collection of plainspoken, sparkling pop songs and naked acoustic ballads \u2013 has been a long time coming. The Pauls are just a nice bonus. A Gamilaraay woman, Plum grew up between Brisbane and her grandparents\u2019 farm 20km outside the New South Wales town of Delungra, and she\u2019s essentially been a working musician since leaving school. The first song she ever recorded \u2013 \u201cthe first one I really took seriously\u201d \u2013 was Father Said, a haunting, assured minute-fifty that she uploaded to Triple J\u2019s Unearthed platform in 2012. It won her the title of the best unsigned Indigenous artist in the country, and a spot performing at the National Indigenous Music Awards, and \u201cit all started from there\u201d. \u201cI\u2019d finished school and I was just playing lots of gigs \u2013 as many as I could around Brisbane in cafes and bars. I didn\u2019t really have any desire to go to uni, or anything like that. I just wanted to play music in front of people.\u201d Kelly was \u201cthe first white person I\u2019d ever heard sing about Aboriginal people\u201d, she says \u2013 but she was also a fan of the few Indigenous women she saw on Video Hits, thrilling to Shakaya and Jessica Mauboy between Madonna and Pink. \u201cWhen I sing [album track] Homecoming Queen, I talk about how I felt looking in magazines and not seeing anyone that looks like me,\u201d she says. \u201cI loved watching television and watching film clips. I didn\u2019t understand and it took me a little bit longer to figure out how to love myself. That I am just as worthy.\u201d She didn\u2019t \u2013 or couldn\u2019t \u2013 rush her first album, either. \u201cI just don\u2019t think I was ready [after her 2015 EP Monsters]. I just think I needed to go through what I\u2019ve been through, my life experiences in the last couple of years, to be able to come up with these songs.\u201d The starkest example might be the album\u2019s title track, Better in Blak. When she released it as a single in April, she posted on Instagram about its origins: she\u2019d been in the studio in London in May 2018, when her phone began \u201cblowing up\u201d with dozens of messages and comments, mostly containing abuse and slurs both racist and misogynist. It was an ugly second wind of an old battle back home, sparked in 2016 by a private Facebook post from her about an alleged altercation in a Sydney pub with a member of another band. Screenshots of that post were picked up by local music press, and she became a flashpoint for fans furious at the dent in the band\u2019s reputation. Now another public post, not from her, reignited the fight, and sent a further chorus of voices to her social media channels \u2013 and some of the band\u2019s angry fans to her shows, which she says has led her to sometimes feel unsafe. \u201cWhen I get messages saying \u2018you Abo\u2019 and things like that. I don\u2019t see my friends, my white friends, getting messages that say stuff like that and are that horrific,\u201d she points out. \u201cYou can\u2019t say it\u2019s not about colour when they\u2019re the messages that I\u2019m receiving.\u201d The next day, Alex Burnett, Plum\u2019s writing partner and producer, pushed her to channel it into a driving, sly, phenomenally catchy celebration of her own self-image: \u201cIf I knew what I know then maybe I would take it back / but fuck that / I look better in blak\u201d. \u201cIt was really rough,\u201d she says matter-of-factly. \u201cIt was really, really sad. I wanted to just delete all of my social media and become invisible to everyone. It was pretty hard and shitty. But then, this song kind of came from that. Sometimes bad things can open a space to create something that\u2019s not bad.\u201d Plum is a refreshingly straightforward lyricist. The songs on Better in Blak are direct, raw, and often funny: from Do You Ever Get So Sad You Can\u2019t Breathe and Love &amp; War (written with Gang of Youths\u2019 David Le\u2019aupepe as a response to the Don Dale scandal) to the scathing Woke Blokes and the reworked teen angst of the song Nick Cave, a track Plum wrote years ago after a twisted-up teenage heartbreak that led her to pretend that she, like him, was a vegan \u2013 when she was extremely not. \u201cOne time we were out at an event and someone came around with antipastos and I, literally, out loud said, \u2018Fuck yeah, prosciutto\u2019,\u201d she explains. \u201cHe was like \u2018Thelma, that\u2019s meat,\u2019 and I was like \u2013\u201d [adopting a look of horrified confusion] \u201c\u2018What? What do you mean?\u2019 And then I threw it across the room.\u201d If there\u2019s a connecting thread through the songs, it\u2019s that you don\u2019t need to reject the various people you used to be on your way to loving who you are now; that the ugliness, whether it\u2019s social injustice or trolls or crushing heartbreak, can create beauty and growth if you pick them up and use them as tools, and then moving past them. \u201cLike this morning, I got a \u2018Go fuck yourself\u2019 [on Instagram]. All the time it happens. Like every single day of my life. But I don\u2019t care about it like I used to now. I just want to get on with life and play music. That\u2019s what I love doing.\u201d \u2022 Better in Blak by Thelma Plum is out on Friday 12 July through Warner Music. She is touring Australia through August",

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s emissions are again the highest on record, driven this time by an increase in emissions from the electricity sector, which rose to their highest levels in two years, according to new figures. Fugitive emissions from Australia\u2019s LNG industry also continue to fuel rising national emissions. Ndevr Environmental, an emissions-tracking organisation that publishes quarterly greenhouse gas emissions data months ahead of the federal government, says its latest research shows emissions for the year to March 2019 increased to 561 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. That was up from 554.5 million tonnes the previous year and 551.2 million tonnes in 2017. These figures exclude unreliable data from the land-use sector, but Ndevr said that even when land-use was included emissions had still increased for four consecutive years over the same period. According to Ndevr\u2019s research, there was an 8.2% increase in emissions from the electricity sector between the December and March quarters. It follows three consecutive quarters of declines in electricity emissions and is the highest increase in emissions from that sector since March 2017. However, rising emissions from electricity generation between the December and March quarters is not unusual due to higher energy use in the warmer months. Ndevr\u2019s managing director, Matt Drum, said there was less renewable generation in March 2019 than there was in the March quarter the previous year, with Ndevr\u2019s data showing falls in both wind and hydro power. Drum said the continued rise in fugitive emissions as a result of Australia\u2019s LNG industry showed there was \u201ca lot of work to be done around offsetting and reducing emissions from the LNG sector\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s offsetting particularly through land-use projects, but also energy efficiency,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd whether the carbon capture and storage nut can be cracked for that sector is going to be really important.\u201d Drum dismissed recent comments by Australia\u2019s energy and emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, that LNG exports were contributing to emissions reductions overseas. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cI don\u2019t think you can prosecute that argument unless you also take into account our coal exports, which have a counter effect,\u201d Drum said.

The cap on all funding requests has also been removed.</p> <p>It\u2019s a change that organisations say is deeply concerning, with many worrying that large-scale capital and infrastructure projects will be favoured over supporting artists to make art.</p> <p>\u201cWe all look at it with trepidation,\u201d said Jenny Duck-Chong, the artistic director of vocal ensemble Halcyon. \u201cDoes it just mean that a big infrastructure project is going to get gazillions of dollars that could have been funding actual artists\u2019 projects of creation? We don\u2019t know the answer to that. And I think that\u2019s a worry.

      "bodyText": "The cost of revamping one of Sydney\u2019s flagship arts precincts has almost doubled, amid growing concern that public expenditure on lavish capital works and infrastructure is coming at the expense of supporting artists. The New South Wales government has promised the refurbishment of the Walsh Bay arts precinct will deliver Sydney a \u201cworld-class arts precinct\u201d and transform the home of prestigious groups like the Sydney Theatre Company, Sydney Dance Company and Bangarra Dance Theatre. The refurbishment was initially estimated to cost $128.6 million, but that figure has climbed significantly since. In May, the arts minister, Don Harwin, told the NSW Legislative Council that the cost for the project would be $207m. The most recent budget, however, listed the cost at $245.1m. The shadow arts minister, Walt Secord, said there had been differing figures \u201cbouncing around for some time\u201d and called on Harwin to fully explain the price of the Walsh Bay project. \u201cWith small and medium-sized arts groups struggling to survive on minuscule budgets, the Berejiklian government must detail the new estimated cost,\u201d Secord said. A spokesman for Create NSW, the state\u2019s arts funding body, said added costs to the Walsh Bay redevelopment were \u201creflective of the implementation of a significant maintenance program to ensure the structural integrity of the wharves\u201d, additional support for tenants during the redevelopment, and \u201cmarket increases since the original announcement\u201d. The agency said the government\u2019s main funding pool for artists, the Arts and Cultural Development Program (ACDP), would not be used to cover the Walsh Bay project, or for other major capital works. But the blowout comes at a time of significant funding uncertainty in the sector. Create NSW announced a large-scale shakeup of the ACDP in June that involved significant streamlining of grant round dates and funding categories. Requests to fund creative works will now will be pooled directly against capital and infrastructure grant requests, where they had previously been assessed and funded separately. The cap on all funding requests has also been removed. It\u2019s a change that organisations say is deeply concerning, with many worrying that large-scale capital and infrastructure projects will be favoured over supporting artists to make art. \u201cWe all look at it with trepidation,\u201d said Jenny Duck-Chong, the artistic director of vocal ensemble Halcyon. \u201cDoes it just mean that a big infrastructure project is going to get gazillions of dollars that could have been funding actual artists\u2019 projects of creation? We don\u2019t know the answer to that. And I think that\u2019s a worry. It says it\u2019s going to be transparent, and it says it\u2019s going to be open and accessible and that\u2019s great \u2013 if it is.\u201d The percussionist Claire Edwardes told Guardian Australia that she thought the lack of a cap on funding requests was worrying. \u201cGenerally speaking, when there\u2019s no cap it doesn\u2019t favour independent artists,\u201d she said. When asked what guarantees the government could give that artistic projects would be considered fairly against capital works, the Create NSW spokesman said: \u201cThe focus of all applications under the new guidelines will be an outcome of artistic excellence.\u201d Last year, Harwin came under fire for personally intervening in the final stage of a grants round, redirecting $400,000 from arts organisations that had been approved by the peer review process to a $1m one-off grant towards capital works for the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. The SSO later handed the grant back. Duck-Chong said that incident had been \u201ca real killer for any sort of goodwill and trust\u201d in the process, making smaller organisations feel like they weren\u2019t valid or valued. \u201cFunding for infrastructure is important, but they shouldn\u2019t be being judged alongside each other in my mind. They\u2019re totally different planets.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The historic Walsh Bay wharves are home to Sydney Theatre Company, Sydney Dance Company, Bangarra Dance Theatre, Australian Theatre for Young People, Gondwana Choir, Sydney Philharmonia Choir and The Song Company, plus a number of other arts organisations, all of which had to be relocated \u2013 some of them permanently \u2013 for the works in the precinct to get under way. The redevelopment has suffered several setbacks since its announcement, including a long legal battle against local business. It was supposed to be completed in 2019 but is now scheduled to be completed in 2020. Elizabeth Rogers, CEO of Regional Arts NSW, told Guardian Australia that there were \u201cmore questions than answers in the sector at the moment.\u201d There were question marks over how much funding would actually be available through the recently announced program, how applications would be ranked within it, and what kind of priority regional and community arts would be given in the new framework, she said. \u201cThe devil is going to be in the detail.\u201d A spokesperson for Harwin directed questions to Create NSW.",

So during his post-match press conference the Diary put it to Nadal that he should have swapped with Barty and, well, it didn\u2019t go ideally: The Diary: \u201cDo you think there was an argument that Barty\u2019s game should have been on Centre Court?\u201d Nadal: \u201cBut can we predict the future or not?\u201d The Diary: \u201cShe\u2019s the world No 1.\u201d Nadal: \u201cI am the world No 2 and I won 18 grand slams.\u201d [laughter] The Diary: \u201cSo that\u2019s a no?\u201d Nadal: \u201cMy answer is not no or yes. In the world of tennis today, honestly, my feeling is today I am little bit more than Ashleigh Barty, even if Ashleigh Barty is the first player of the world and she already won in the French Open and she is playing unbelievable good. Every day is a decision. We cannot create polemics about that. Court No 2, OK, they have to make decisions. Today they probably decided that. They have other girls playing on the Centre Court now.\u201d It feels like the problem has not quite been put to bed just yet.",

      "bodyText": "Two-thirds of passengers with disabilities still experience barriers to travel when using trains, government research has found. A lack of accessible toilets in carriages, being unable to use ticket machines and antisocial behaviour were among the issues cited by respondents to the Department for Transport (DfT) survey. Of those who said they had faced problems during train journeys, 37% said onboard announcements were unclear, while 29% of people surveyed said they had been on a train with no toilets onboard that they could use. James Taylor, the head of policy at the disability equality charity Scope, said: \u201cProblems such as inaccessible vehicles, poor customer service, and lack of up-to-date information can make it very difficult for disabled people to get to work, socialise and live independently. \u201cWorryingly, this research has found half of disabled people anticipate experiencing a problem before it has happened when using the rail network.\u201d Another 31% of passengers with disabilities said they had experienced antisocial or discriminatory behaviour from other passengers, including receiving aggressive responses after asking to sit in a priority seat. Some said a perceived \u201chierarchy\u201d of need in terms of priority seating on trains was often behind such conflicts, with those with less visible disabilities sometimes considered to be less in need. Because of issues such as inaccessible stations and the lack of priority seating on trains, many passengers with disabilities said they also had to meticulously plan journeys: travelling at off-peak times, booking ahead and ensuring they left enough time to allow for unplanned events such as encountering a broken lift. Although 20% of respondents said they booked passenger assistance in advance before travelling by train, the service is not available at some stations and overall awareness of it was low. Some passengers also reported accessibility problems at stations, with one challenge being the number of physical tickets, including seat reservation slips, required for a journey. Others said that if ticket offices were closed, machines could be difficult for wheelchair users or those with dexterity impairments, dyslexia, learning disabilities or vision impairments to use. The research was conducted in 2017. There were more than 1,550 respondents, who had a range of disabilities including mental health conditions, mobility issues and vision or hearing impairments. The DfT said: \u201cWe are acutely aware of the difficulties faced by disabled passengers using our railways, and we are working hard to deliver the upgrades needed. Since this research was commissioned over two years ago our inclusive transport strategy has delivered step-free access at around 1,500 stations.\u201d On Monday, the department announced it would spend an extra \u00a320m on improving accessibility for rail passengers with disabilities.

      "bodyText": "An Italian court has sentenced 24 people to life in prison for their involvement in Operation Condor, in which the dictatorships of six South American countries conspired to kidnap and assassinate political opponents in each other\u2019s territories. The trial, the first of its kind in Europe, began in 2015 and focused on the responsibility of senior officials in the military dictatorships of Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay, Brazil, Bolivia and Argentina for the killing and disappearance of 43 people including 23 Italian citizens. Those sentenced on Monday included Francisco Morales Berm\u00fadez, who was president of Peru from 1975 to 1980, Juan Carlos Blanco, a former foreign minister in Uruguay, Pedro Espinoza Bravo, a former deputy intelligence chief in Chile, and Jorge N\u00e9stor Fern\u00e1ndez Troccoli, a Uruguayan former naval intelligence officer. Exactly how many people died as a result of the conspiracy is unknown, but prosecutors in South America and Italy provided evidence that at least 100 leftwing activists were killed in Argentina, including 45 Uruguayans, 22 Chileans, 15 Paraguayans and 13 Bolivians. \u201cOperation Condor spared no one,\u201d said Francesca Lessa, a research fellow at Oxford University\u2019s Latin American Centre. \u201cRefugees and asylum seekers were especially targeted, while children \u2013 illegally detained with their parents \u2013 had their biological identity stolen and replaced by that of adoptive families.\u201d According to a database recording the crimes of the coordinated regional repression, at least 496 people of 11 nationalities were kidnapped under the auspices of Operation Condor. Declassified documents suggest some victims were drugged, their stomachs were slit open and they were dropped from planes into the Atlantic Ocean. Other victims\u2019 bodies were cemented into barrels and thrown into rivers. Monday\u2019s verdict was the result of years of pressure from the families of those who disappeared. \u201cFor decades, the victims\u2019 relatives have been seeking justice,\u201d Lessa said. \u201cIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, impunity dominated South America, with former politicians and military officials involved in Condor Operation still enjoying immunity. Bringing them before a judge to take responsibility for their crimes was not a simple undertaking.\u201d The crimes took place in the 1970s and 1980s. \u201cMany of the perpetrators were growing old and may never be brought to justice,\u201d said Jorge Ithurburu, a lawyer for 24 Marzo, a Rome-based NGO. \u201cThe more time passed the more the witnesses of those atrocious crimes aged or died.\u201d Aurora Meloni, 68, whose husband, Daniel Banfi, was kidnapped and murdered in Buenos Aires in 1974, told the Guardian: \u201cWe\u2019ve never given up and today we all won. Today\u2019s ruling is not only for my husband \u2026 today\u2019s ruling is dedicated to all the people killed and kidnapped under Condor.\u201d Prosecutors in the case drew on the precedent set in 2000 by the arrest in London of the former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet under the principle of \u201cuniversal jurisdiction\u201d. In 2016, Argentina\u2019s last military dictator, Reynaldo Bignone, and 16 other former military officials were sentenced to years in prison, marking the first time a court had proved the existence of Operation Condor. Last April, a newly declassified CIA document showed that European intelligence agencies sought advice from South America\u2019s 1970s dictatorships on how to combat leftwing \u201csubversion\u201d. \u201cRepresentatives of West German, French and British intelligence services had visited the Condor organization secretariat in Buenos Aires during the month of September 1977 in order to discuss methods for establishment of an anti-subversion organization similar to Condor,\u201d the document stated. According to the human rights prosecution office in Buenos Aires, 977 former military officers and collaborators are in jail for crimes relating to Argentina\u2019s dictatorship.",

Rejecting calls for extra safeguards when handling underage informants, Mr Justice Supperstone acknowledged they were more vulnerable than adults but dismissed claims that their human rights were being breached. The case was brought by the charity Just For Kids Law which argued that regulations governing recruiting and deploying children as covert human intelligence sources (CHIS) do not contain \u201cadequate safeguards\u201d. During the hearing last month, Caoilfhionn Gallagher QC, for the charity, said the government believed there was \u201cincreasing scope\u201d for using children as informants because they were increasingly involved in serious crimes, both as perpetrators and victims. Gallagher said the use of children in investigations and prosecutions of serious offences such as terrorism, county lines drug offences and child sexual exploitation, raised \u201cserious concerns\u201d about their safety and wellbeing. But, delivering judgment on Monday, Supperstone concluded that the scheme was lawful. He said: \u201cIn my judgment, there is no unacceptable risk of breach of the \u2026 rights of a juvenile CHIS inherent in the scheme. \u201cI reject the claimant\u2019s contention that the scheme is inadequate in its safeguarding of the interests and welfare of juvenile CHIS.\u201d The judge also found that it was \u201cnot irrational\u201d for the scheme to ensure that an appropriate adult was provided for those aged 15 and under but not for those aged 16 and 17. Supperstone said his conclusions had been \u201creinforced\u201d by confidential material he had seen. Responding to the ruling, Just For Kids Law\u2019s chief executive, Enver Solomon, said the decision was disappointing and the charity was considering its options and continuing to crowdfund the legal challenge. Solomon added: \u201cThe judgment acknowledges the \u2018very significant risk of physical and psychological harm to children\u2019 and a variety of dangers that arise from their use as covert informants in the context of serious crime. \u201cWe remain convinced that new protections are needed to keep these children safe.

Nor does she wash her clothes. I\u2019ve really drilled into this to find out what she does when her clothes are dirty. \u201cThe rule on a bespoke suit is you do not clean it. You do not touch it. You let the dirt dry and you brush it off. Basically, in life, rule of thumb: if you don\u2019t absolutely have to clean anything, don\u2019t clean it.\u201d</p> <p>There is, in the intersection of beauty, fashion, feminism and sustainability, a subtle variant to the concept of the humblebrag: ideas that sound woke but which only work if you\u2019re an incredibly beautiful person with incredibly expensive clothes. Don\u2019t wear makeup; don\u2019t throw anything away; throw away all face creams and merely splash yourself in vinegar; don\u2019t go to the dry-cleaner. It reached its apex with a suggestion from Vivienne Westwood that you never had to buy a new T-shirt, you should merely print out a slogan or photograph and affix it with a safety pin to your existing T-shirt. And all these ideas work magnificently well on a model, but miss the point of adornment, which is to distract people from what you actually look like, not bloody draw attention to it.</p> <p>On the specific matter of dirt, I think McCartney is barking up the wrong tree. Most people are extremely comfortable with things staying dirty if no one else is going to see them. I remember a survey in the 1990s that found women under 35 changed their boyfriends more often than they washed their duvet, which made perfect sense because, realistically, boyfriends go out more often than duvets. Really, the driving imperative behind washing things is they are stained or they smell. The kinds of dirt you can brush off could be counted on the fingers of one hand (mud; and, at a pinch, Rice Krispies). There is a whole world of everyday soiling (mainly, in my experience, from food, escalators, pens, pets, children and the excretions of your own unruly self) that would laugh in the face of a brush.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/jul/07/stella-mccartney-its-not-like-i-am-here-for-an-easy-life\">Stella McCartney: \u2018It\u2019s not like I\u2019m here for an easy life\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, let\u2019s accept a kernel of truth in what McCartney says, that dry-cleaning is more environmentally harmful than washing, and even if you just washed things less often, that would be a start. Here are my all-time top tips: be extremely clean yourself. Almost always, you are the problem. Never cycle in regular clothes. Have a set of clothes to cycle in, and call these \u201cthe clothes that smell already\u201d. Pay children 10p for every item of school uniform unsullied enough to wear again. I often then steal the 10ps back as I need them, and they never notice because it\u2019s all about the transaction. Own at least one pair of PVC trousers, because once you\u2019ve tasted the peace of a wipe-clean garment, you\u2019ll never look back. Almost everything that says \u201cdry-clean only\u201d can cope with a very cool wash. But things that say \u201ccool wash\u201d do tend to mean it. Try to spill things down the back of yourself, then you won\u2019t notice, and in all probability, nor will anyone else. Don\u2019t buy white things in the first place. Marshal the social capital of a haughty manner to offset larger or more distinctive blemishes such as egg. Cheap fibres actively attract smells, so stick to natural and expensive fabrics, such as cotton, which is unfortunately also catastrophic for the environment, but eyes on the prize here, everyone.</p> <p>McCartney\u2019s is actually a Victorian idea: they only considered underclothes really clothes at all, and all outerwear brushable, in the manner of a coat or shoes. So feel free to experiment with vests and knickerbockers. Or just try to be less fastidious. In line with Marx\u2019s theory of diminishing returns, if we were all covered in muck, none of us would mind.</p> <p>\u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Basically, in life, rule of thumb: if you don\u2019t absolutely have to clean anything, don\u2019t clean it.\u201d There is, in the intersection of beauty, fashion, feminism and sustainability, a subtle variant to the concept of the humblebrag: ideas that sound woke but which only work if you\u2019re an incredibly beautiful person with incredibly expensive clothes. Don\u2019t wear makeup; don\u2019t throw anything away; throw away all face creams and merely splash yourself in vinegar; don\u2019t go to the dry-cleaner. It reached its apex with a suggestion from Vivienne Westwood that you never had to buy a new T-shirt, you should merely print out a slogan or photograph and affix it with a safety pin to your existing T-shirt. And all these ideas work magnificently well on a model, but miss the point of adornment, which is to distract people from what you actually look like, not bloody draw attention to it. On the specific matter of dirt, I think McCartney is barking up the wrong tree. Most people are extremely comfortable with things staying dirty if no one else is going to see them. I remember a survey in the 1990s that found women under 35 changed their boyfriends more often than they washed their duvet, which made perfect sense because, realistically, boyfriends go out more often than duvets. Really, the driving imperative behind washing things is they are stained or they smell. The kinds of dirt you can brush off could be counted on the fingers of one hand (mud; and, at a pinch, Rice Krispies). There is a whole world of everyday soiling (mainly, in my experience, from food, escalators, pens, pets, children and the excretions of your own unruly self) that would laugh in the face of a brush. However, let\u2019s accept a kernel of truth in what McCartney says, that dry-cleaning is more environmentally harmful than washing, and even if you just washed things less often, that would be a start. Here are my all-time top tips: be extremely clean yourself. Almost always, you are the problem. Never cycle in regular clothes. Have a set of clothes to cycle in, and call these \u201cthe clothes that smell already\u201d. Pay children 10p for every item of school uniform unsullied enough to wear again. I often then steal the 10ps back as I need them, and they never notice because it\u2019s all about the transaction. Own at least one pair of PVC trousers, because once you\u2019ve tasted the peace of a wipe-clean garment, you\u2019ll never look back. Almost everything that says \u201cdry-clean only\u201d can cope with a very cool wash. But things that say \u201ccool wash\u201d do tend to mean it. Try to spill things down the back of yourself, then you won\u2019t notice, and in all probability, nor will anyone else. Don\u2019t buy white things in the first place. Marshal the social capital of a haughty manner to offset larger or more distinctive blemishes such as egg. Cheap fibres actively attract smells, so stick to natural and expensive fabrics, such as cotton, which is unfortunately also catastrophic for the environment, but eyes on the prize here, everyone. McCartney\u2019s is actually a Victorian idea: they only considered underclothes really clothes at all, and all outerwear brushable, in the manner of a coat or shoes. So feel free to experiment with vests and knickerbockers. Or just try to be less fastidious. In line with Marx\u2019s theory of diminishing returns, if we were all covered in muck, none of us would mind. \u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>Yes, climate change mitigation requires excess atmospheric carbon dioxide to be absorbed and stored in vegetation (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/04/planting-billions-trees-best-tackle-climate-crisis-scientists-canopy-emissions\" title=\"\">Planting billions of trees \u2018best way to save planet\u2019</a>, 5 July). However, the strategy is not as straightforward as presented.</p> <p>Put simply, we emit the carbon in fossil fuels into the atmosphere as excess CO<sub>2</sub>. This absorbs heat otherwise leaving the planet. A policy of planting vegetation, especially trees, that absorbs CO<sub>2</sub> lessens this excess. So far, so, good; but we must ask what eventually happens to this vegetation?</p> <p>Burning it indiscriminately only puts the carbon back into the atmosphere, albeit with a time delay. So the basic criteria must include: fossil fuels remaining underground; timber becoming permanently locked up (eg, in buildings and furniture); and vegetation, including leaves and branches, being composted into soil. By the first criterion, a major aspect becomes using the vegetation to substitute for fossil fuels. The many processes are well known, including modern biomass and biofuel technology. These must expand to global scale while improving efficiency and harmlessness in use. Moreover, success in mitigating climate change demands that we in the developed world curb our excessive lifestyles.</p> <p>The third criterion touches on a subject that is poorly assessed. Much more vegetation should be composted into soil \u2013 for example, garden and field hedge cuttings. No field fire can be a bonfire, they are all malfires, provoking climate change.</p> <p>Above all, mitigating climate change by growing trees should also become a personal challenge. Our breath takes in oxygen and expels carbon dioxide; a tree does the opposite. Each of us needs one mature tree for our metabolic equilibrium. Moreover our average UK lifestyle with oxygen-consuming fuels requires 100 trees. Do you have 101 trees? If not, why not? There are many ways to invest in trees \u2013 go to it.<br><strong>Dr John Twidell</strong><br><em>Horninghold, Leicestershire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Damian Carrington hails new research revealing that \u201ca worldwide planting programme could remove two-thirds of all the emissions that have been pumped into the atmosphere by human activities\u201d. The analysis found there are 1.7bn hectares of treeless land on which 1.2tn native tree saplings would naturally grow. That area is about 11% of all land and equivalent to the size of the US and China combined.</p> <p>Unfortunately that area also rivals the extent of the bright polar sea ice, whose loss to global warming threatens to amplify climate change by decreasing the Earth\u2019s \u201calbedo\u201d \u2013 its average capacity to reflect solar energy back into space.</p> <p>Just as the deep blue sea is darker than polar ice, green forests tend to absorb roughly twice as much solar heat as the generally paler ground they overshadow. Geoengineering is where you find it, and humanity\u2019s impact on albedo \u2013 we have already physically altered half of the land surface of the Earth \u2013 deserves as much thought as managing our carbon footprint.<br><strong>Russell Seitz</strong><br><em>Senior research fellow, The Climate Institute</em></p> <p>\u2022 As a local climate action group that has planted over a quarter of a million trees over the past 21 years, we welcome the acknowledgement that tree-planting can play a significant role in tackling the climate crisis. However, it is (literally) important to keep our feet on the ground.</p> <p>First, the total projected cost of $300bn is based on a price per tree of 24p \u2013 we can\u2019t even buy trees for that, let alone do the necessary fencing and protection to keep animals away from them as they grow, and cover other planting costs.</p> <p>Second, Prof Simon Lewis\u2019s point about soils is a vital one. The map of the UK showing potential planting areas appears to envisage trees being planted on blanket bogs. These peat bogs are Britain\u2019s most significant habitat type due to their global rarity and carbon storage (far in excess of our woodlands). Tree-planting on these areas would be totally counterproductive.</p> <p>Third, planetary-scale landscape plans may look good on paper, but they are unlikely to come to fruition without involving local people, and huge cultural change. Realistic (and non-bureaucratic) incentives to cover the true costs of increasing tree-cover will be necessary, but they will not be a quick fix.</p> <p>So, yes to trees, but not at the expense of urgent measures to cut carbon dioxide emissions. The government currently spends \u00a32.5bn on export subsidies for UK companies\u2019 fossil fuel projects abroad. Reallocating this funding to clean energy and reforestation would be the place to start.<br><strong>Penny Eastwood</strong><br><em>Treesponsibility, Climate Action in Calderdale</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/05/the-guardian-view-on-the-climate-emergency-forests-can-help-to-save-us\" title=\"\">editorial</a> (6 July) makes a crucial point in connection with reforestation and the preservation of existing forests, that \u201cthe green movement is not just about economics. It must also speak to our spiritual sides if it is to mobilise a global coalition\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Yes, climate change mitigation requires excess atmospheric carbon dioxide to be absorbed and stored in vegetation (Planting billions of trees \u2018best way to save planet\u2019, 5 July). However, the strategy is not as straightforward as presented. Put simply, we emit the carbon in fossil fuels into the atmosphere as excess CO2. This absorbs heat otherwise leaving the planet. A policy of planting vegetation, especially trees, that absorbs CO2 lessens this excess. So far, so, good; but we must ask what eventually happens to this vegetation? Burning it indiscriminately only puts the carbon back into the atmosphere, albeit with a time delay. So the basic criteria must include: fossil fuels remaining underground; timber becoming permanently locked up (eg, in buildings and furniture); and vegetation, including leaves and branches, being composted into soil. By the first criterion, a major aspect becomes using the vegetation to substitute for fossil fuels. The many processes are well known, including modern biomass and biofuel technology. These must expand to global scale while improving efficiency and harmlessness in use. Moreover, success in mitigating climate change demands that we in the developed world curb our excessive lifestyles. The third criterion touches on a subject that is poorly assessed. Much more vegetation should be composted into soil \u2013 for example, garden and field hedge cuttings. No field fire can be a bonfire, they are all malfires, provoking climate change. Above all, mitigating climate change by growing trees should also become a personal challenge. Our breath takes in oxygen and expels carbon dioxide; a tree does the opposite. Each of us needs one mature tree for our metabolic equilibrium. Moreover our average UK lifestyle with oxygen-consuming fuels requires 100 trees. Do you have 101 trees? If not, why not? There are many ways to invest in trees \u2013 go to it. Dr John Twidell Horninghold, Leicestershire \u2022 Damian Carrington hails new research revealing that \u201ca worldwide planting programme could remove two-thirds of all the emissions that have been pumped into the atmosphere by human activities\u201d. The analysis found there are 1.7bn hectares of treeless land on which 1.2tn native tree saplings would naturally grow. That area is about 11% of all land and equivalent to the size of the US and China combined. Unfortunately that area also rivals the extent of the bright polar sea ice, whose loss to global warming threatens to amplify climate change by decreasing the Earth\u2019s \u201calbedo\u201d \u2013 its average capacity to reflect solar energy back into space. Just as the deep blue sea is darker than polar ice, green forests tend to absorb roughly twice as much solar heat as the generally paler ground they overshadow. Geoengineering is where you find it, and humanity\u2019s impact on albedo \u2013 we have already physically altered half of the land surface of the Earth \u2013 deserves as much thought as managing our carbon footprint. Russell Seitz Senior research fellow, The Climate Institute \u2022 As a local climate action group that has planted over a quarter of a million trees over the past 21 years, we welcome the acknowledgement that tree-planting can play a significant role in tackling the climate crisis. However, it is (literally) important to keep our feet on the ground. First, the total projected cost of $300bn is based on a price per tree of 24p \u2013 we can\u2019t even buy trees for that, let alone do the necessary fencing and protection to keep animals away from them as they grow, and cover other planting costs. Second, Prof Simon Lewis\u2019s point about soils is a vital one. The map of the UK showing potential planting areas appears to envisage trees being planted on blanket bogs. These peat bogs are Britain\u2019s most significant habitat type due to their global rarity and carbon storage (far in excess of our woodlands). Tree-planting on these areas would be totally counterproductive. Third, planetary-scale landscape plans may look good on paper, but they are unlikely to come to fruition without involving local people, and huge cultural change. Realistic (and non-bureaucratic) incentives to cover the true costs of increasing tree-cover will be necessary, but they will not be a quick fix. So, yes to trees, but not at the expense of urgent measures to cut carbon dioxide emissions. The government currently spends \u00a32.5bn on export subsidies for UK companies\u2019 fossil fuel projects abroad. Reallocating this funding to clean energy and reforestation would be the place to start. Penny Eastwood Treesponsibility, Climate Action in Calderdale \u2022 Your editorial (6 July) makes a crucial point in connection with reforestation and the preservation of existing forests, that \u201cthe green movement is not just about economics. It must also speak to our spiritual sides if it is to mobilise a global coalition\u201d. We face the threat of possible climate breakdown and ecosystem collapse, and the reality is that neither the corporate world nor the governmental world are going to initiate decisive action against their own short-term interests, defined in terms of growth and electability. One way to achieve the critical mass needed to drive significant change in human behaviour is to mobilise the world\u2019s largest voluntary organisations \u2013 the religions. Grounded in moral and ethical principles, they claim an \u201canthropocosmic\u201d perspective; they have vast human and material resources, and billions of positively motivated and socially committed followers around the globe with whom they are in ongoing communication. What the religions really need, however, especially those in the western world with declining active memberships, is a compelling cause to help regain the interest and involvement of a younger generation. A compelling cause? That\u2019s exactly what the ecology and environmental movements offer \u2013 the opportunity to care for what the religions think of as \u201cGod\u2019s creation\u201d. On the other hand, what ecologists really need is the sheer weight of numbers that religions can provide \u2013 the millions of supportive activists required to put pressure on the corporate and governmental worlds, to force them to listen, face facts, and act with urgency. The ecologists and the religions really do need each other.

He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Her Majesty\u2019s government utterly deplores this serious breach of classified information. It is totally unacceptable.

He was on the Today programme this morning repeating that demand. But, given <a href=\"https://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/polls.html\">the Brexit party\u2019s strong showing in current opinion polls</a>, what was more interesting was what he said about his desire to see a \u201ca realignment of politics ... on the leave side\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points from his interview.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Farage said he wanted to see \u201ca realignment of politics ... on the leave side\u201d. </strong>Talking about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/05/pro-emain-parties-strike-brecon-and-radnorshire-byelection-pact-to-fight-conservatives\">the forthcoming Brecon and Radnorshire byelection,</a> where Plaid Cymru and the Greens have decided to stand aside to give their fellow pro-remain allies, the Liberal Democrats, a better chance of winning, Farage said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The fact that the remain parties have got together virtually guarantees them a victory I would have thought in this seat. It\u2019s a formal Liberal Democrat seat. It\u2019s going to make it a very, very tough fight for us. And it gives leave voters a to think about.</p> \n   <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/07/peterborough-byelection-result-labour-sees-off-brexit-party-threat-to-hold-seat\">In Peterborough </a>the Brexit party was the contender against the Labour party, and yet quite a lot of people still voted Conservative, and because of that Labour on 31% won. So at some point in time what I would like to see is a genuine realignment of politics, not just on the remain side, but on the leave side too.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Farage was not pressed on this, and it was not clear what he meant by \u201crealignment\u201d. It could mean some form of Tory/Brexit party electoral pact. Or the Brexit party replacing the Conservatives. Or the Conservatives absorbing the Brexit party (which is what some Tories hope will happen under Boris Johnson, although you could argue that this will end up as a reverse takeover by the Brexit party). But the question is one that won\u2019t go away. <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/vince-cable-britain-needs-an-anti-brexit-alliance/\">In an article for Politico today,</a><strong> Sir Vince Cable</strong>, the Lib Dem leader, says that the decision of the Lib Dems, Plaid and the Greens to cooperate in Brecon and Radnorshire is \u201ca beacon of political pragmatism\u201d, that the same thing could happen again in other contests, perhaps with the Lib Dems standing aside to help a pro-EU rival, and that this strategy \u201coffers a roadmap for building an effective anti-Brexit front that can save our country from lurching towards disaster\u201d.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Farage dismissed the idea that he should be appointed ambassador to the US. </strong>Donald Trump suggested the idea in 2016, and there was some speculation yesterday that the Kim Darroch leak might be intended to create the opportunity for Boris Johnson to appoint Farage to this role <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SamCoatesSky/status/1147962686061367297\">(although the Johnson camp has dismissed the idea).</a> Asked if he would accept the post if it were offered to him, Farage said he was \u201cnot a diplomat\u201d. He went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right man for that job.

Speaking on the Today programme,<strong> Liam Fox,</strong> the international trade secretary, defended Darroch strongly and insisted that there was no reason why he should now have to quit. And while Fox said that he would be apologising to the Trump administration for the fact that Darroch\u2019s views were leaked, he indicated that he would not be apologising for what Darroch actually said. Here are the main points from the interview.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Fox said the leak of Darroch\u2019s memos, and even Trump\u2019s criticism of him, would not stop him being able to carry on as the British ambassador.</strong> Fox said he knew from his widespread contacts in Washington that Darroch was held in high regard. Asked if Darroch would be able to remain in post, Fox said: </li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>With the widespread contacts that I have in Washington and in the administration and amongst congressional leaders, [I know] our ambassador is held in high regard ...</p> \n   <p>It\u2019s not a problem with the ambassador. This is a problem with the ethics of the individual who carried out this particular leak. If people start to want to leak confidential information - leaving aside whether or not it may be a criminal activity - it certainly makes it much more difficult to be able to have the bond of trust within which we can operate in an optimal way.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>When it was put to him that Trump would find it difficult to work with Darroch in future, Fox replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well, I think that who we have as our diplomats is of course a matter for us. And I don\u2019t see, frankly, that this is an impediment to the ambassador being able to work in Washington.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He defended Darroch\u2019s right to give his honest assessment of the Trump administration, although he said Darroch\u2019s views weren\u2019t the same as the government\u2019s</strong>. He said: </li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I do know that the views that that were in our newspapers [ie, in the Darroch memos] don\u2019t reflect the views of the government. But that\u2019s not the role of the diplomatic service. They\u2019re there to make an assessment on a day to day basis. They send regular reports back. Obviously they vary over time. And they add colour so that politicians in London can get a feel for what\u2019s going on elsewhere.

      "bodyText": "A senior Conservative MP has asked the Metropolitan police to investigate the leak of sensitive memos from Sir Kim Darroch, the British ambassador to Washington, criticising the Trump administration. Tabling an urgent question in the Commons, Tom Tugendhat, chair of the foreign affairs committee, told MPs: I have today written to the commissioner of the Metropolitan police to ask that a criminal investigation also be opened into the leak. The government itself has not called in the police, but Sir Alan Duncan, the Foreign Office minister, told MPs: \u201cIf evidence of criminality is found, then yes, the police could be involved.\u201d Duncan also condemned the leak very strongly and said Darroch had the governmnent\u2019s full confidence. He said: Her Majesty\u2019s government utterly deplores this serious breach of classified information. It is totally unacceptable. As the prime minister has already said, we retain full confidence in the British ambassador to Washington Sir Kim Darroch, for whom we have enormous respect as a distinguished and long-serving diplomat. Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, has told MPs that the government is trying to resolve the problem caused by consultant doctors refusing to work overtime because they fear they will be worse off under new pension rules. In response to an urgent question about the crisis, Truss said: Some senior clinicians face pension tax charges due to the increase in the value of their pension accrual, in fact I understand that the Secretary of State for Health is currently in discussion with senior representatives from the BMA, and the Government is taking this issue very seriously. Truss said a consultation addressing this would be published shortly. She went on: There is a fundamental distinction between how do we deal with those issues in the NHS, which the Health Secretary is very much leading on, and the broader issue of our pension system which is there to encourage people to save. That has to be considered in an holistic manner, so we can\u2019t just design it around one workforce, it has to be designed to work for everybody in both the public and private sector. Evidence given by the former Welsh first minister Carwyn Jones at an inquest into the death of the politician Carl Sargeant has been contradicted by another assembly member. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. The Labour MP Stephen Twigg has also announced that he is standing down at the next election. Twigg became the face of Labour\u2019s 1997 landslide victory when he unexpectedly won Enfield Southgate, beating Michael Portillo. After losing his seat in 2005, he was reelected as MP for Liverpool West Derby in 2010. He says that, having been an elected representative for most of the last 30 years (he was also president of the NUS, and a councillor), he has decided as he approaches his mid-50s that he wants to do something new. Mark Drakeford, the Labour first minister of Wales, has suggested that his support for Wales remaining in the UK is not unconditional. He was speaking to the Welsh assembly\u2019s external affairs committee and, judging by this clip (I did not see the full hearing), his comment may not amount to much more than a statement of the obvious. But Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party, claims his admission is significant. Here is the clip. This is what Drakeford said: If you believe the UK is a voluntary association of four nations you have to face the possibility that some component parts of the United Kingdom may no longer choose to be part of it. If that were to be the case in future then of course, any sensible political party or government would have to reassess Wales\u2019 place in the components that were there in the future. So in that sense it can\u2019t possibly be unconditional because there are other moving parts here of which we are not in control. And this is from Delyth Jewell, Plaid\u2019s shadow international relations minister, explaining why Plaid thinks this is significant. The significance of this development cannot be overstated - this is a monumental day in the history of the Welsh nation as a Labour first minister finally admits that independence has to be seriously considered as offering the best future for Wales. As the ongoing political crisis engulfing the UK shows no sign of abating, the only responsible course of action for Welsh government now is to urgently begin the work of scoping out how an independent Welsh state would function. The first minister must therefore announce an in-depth review of our current fiscal situation in order to prepare us for independence day, building on the excellent work contained in the Government Expenditure and Revenue Wales report by the Wales Governance Centre. Remember the controversy about Boris Johnson claiming that, if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would be able to use article 24 of the general agreement on tariffs and trade (Gatt) to carry on tariff-free trade with the EU? Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, was one of many people who pointed out that Johnson was wrong, and Johnson subsequently clarified his position, saying the EU would of course have to agree. Now Roberto Azev\u00eado, director general of the World Trade Organisation (the successor to Gatt) has also clarified that article 24 would not be an option for the UK in the event of no-deal. In an interview with Prospect he said: Article XXIV of the Gatt is simply the provision of global trade law under which free trade agreements and customs unions are concluded ... If there is no agreement, then article XXIV would not apply, and the standard WTO terms would. Duncan finishes by thanking MPs for their cross-party support on this matter, stresses the Commons\u2019s support for Kim Darroch, and expresses the government\u2019s respect for President Trump and his office. Duncan says the government does not see any evidence to suggest another country was involved in the leak. But it is not ruling anything out, he says. Philip Hollobone, a Conservative, asks how many people would have read diplomatic telegrams like this. Duncan says typically more than 100 people would get to see dispatches like these ones, but it would depend on what their security classification was. Bob Stewart, a Conservative, says whoever leaked this information was a \u201ctraitor\u201d. Duncan says this was \u201ca total and inexcusable breach of trust\u201d. Without that trust government cannot function, he says. Duncan says he hopes any decision about when Darroch finishes in Washington should not be influenced by this leak. Michael Fabricant, a Conservative, asks Duncan to confirm there will be a prosecution if the law has been broken. Duncan broadly agrees, but says that it is not for ministers to take decisions about who gets prosecuted. Andrew Bridgen, a Tory, asks if Duncan thinks there is any link between the timing of the link and the fact that, only a week ago, it was reported that Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, fancied Darroch\u2019s job. Duncan says he finds these conspiracy theories tiresome. Bob Seely, a Conservative, says that if the person who leaked the information signed the Official Secrets Act, then the law will have been broken, and the police must be involved. Duncan says whatever law applies will be followed. Duncan says, hearing Nigel Farage on the radio this morning, he first threw something at it, and then turned his radio off. Duncan says, if the leaker is found, he hopes they will regret what what they did for the rest of their life. Duncan says the Commons should condemn the way Nigel Farage leapt on a bandwagon yesterday and called for Kim Darroch to be sacked. He says any respect MPs may have had for Farage will have gone after that. Labour\u2019s Ben Bradshaw says it is inconceivable that a civil servant was responsible. So will the phone records of ministers and advisers be investigate? And he suggests that Brexiter were involved in the leak. Duncan says he has been trying to think of an explanation for the leak, but he says it is hard to think of one that adds up. Sir Bill Cash, the Tory Brexiter, says the real problem is that Darroch was too critical of the US president. These toxic and unjustified attacks on the president of the United States and his administration are regarded by many people as completely unjustified. As chairman of the European scrutiny committee, I was more than well aware of Sir Kim\u2019s own prejudices in relation to the EU. Surely it is not his so-called frankness which should be the issue but his lack of judgment which disqualifies him from his post. Duncan says that contribution was \u201cunworthy\u201d of Cash. He says Darroch\u2019s reporting was of the highest calibre. Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn asks why Jeremy Hunt said he did not agree with what Kim Darroch said. He says many MPs think Darroch was just telling the truth. Duncan says Hunt was making a distinction between an analytical assessment and the view of the government. Duncan says it is fortunate for the reputation of the Foreign Office that Nigel Farage has ruled himself out as a candidate for next ambassador. Duncan says the Mail on Sunday reports quoted extracts from Kim Darroch\u2019s memos out of context. He says, having read Darroch\u2019s dispatches over the years, he knows they are extremely balanced. He says that if people read the full memos when they eventually get released, after 30 years, they will realise that the Mail on Sunday gave a misleading impression of what Darroch was saying. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, is speaking now. She goes back to 1979, and says that when the Iranian revolution happened, the Foreign Office had to launch an inquiry into why it had not seen the revolution coming. The inquiry report stressed the importance of honest information being fed back to London, she says. She says diplomats need to be reassured that they do not need to fear politically motivated truths. And she says they need to be told to keep telling the truth. Duncan agrees. He says if diplomats do not give candid advice, their reports have less value. He says the Foreign Office will always reassure diplomats that, if they speak truth unto power, they will not be personally blamed for that. Tugendhat is responding to Duncan. He says he is worried the UK is getting a reputation for leaking. He says he has written to the Metropolitan police commissioner asking her to launch a criminal investigation. Tom Tugendhat, the Tory MP who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee, says he has asked the police to investigate the Darroch leak. Tom Tugendhat, the Tory chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, asks his urgent question about the Kim Darroch leak. Sir Alan Duncan, the Foreign Office minister, says the government deplores the leak of the Kim Darroch correspondence. He says the government continues to have confidence in Darroch. He says diplomats are paid to be frank. And he says Darroch\u2019s views are not necessarily those of the government. He says the Cabinet Office will lead a cross-government leak inquiry. It will be very thorough, he says. The Labour MP Stephen Pound is also standing down at the next election. Pound, 71, has been MP for Ealing North since 1997. From the BBC\u2019s Ian Watson This is from Sky\u2019s diplomatic editor Dominic Waghorn on the Kim Darroch leak. Theresa May has expressed \u201cfull faith\u201d in her ambassador to the US, Kim Darroch, but rejected his description of Donald Trump as inept and insecure, as she launched an inquiry into the leak of his diplomatic memos. The public should be worried about a no-deal Brexit, the former top civil servant at the Department for Exiting the European Union has said. As Lisa O\u2019Carroll reports, in his first interview since retiring three months ago, Philip Rycroft, the former permanent secretary at DExEU, said: \u201cI think everybody should be worried about what happens in a no-deal situation. We would be taking a step into the unknown.\u201d He told the BBC\u2019s Panorama programme that while Brexit planning in the civil service was in good shape, leaving with no deal, which is one of the options favoured by the Tory leadership contender Boris Johnson, would be \u201cfraught with difficulty\u201d. Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (prime minister), has said there would be a \u201cgreat deal of reluctance\u201d amongst EU leaders to grant the UK another Brexit extension. Speaking at an event in Dublin, he said: There would be a great deal of reluctance among European prime ministers to grant another extension beyond October 31. We certainly wouldn\u2019t rule it out and from Ireland\u2019s point of view we\u2019d be as facilitative to the UK as is possible, but I think a lot of other countries have become very frustrated at these rolling extensions so if there was another extension it would have to be for a particular reason. Anti-Christian persecution should be called out with the label \u201cChristophobia\u201d, Jeremy Hunt has urged. He used the term as he spoke at a news conference to mark the publication of a report saying should be prepared to impose sanctions against countries that persecute Christians. Hunt, the foreign secretary, said: [The report] says that for too long governments have preferred the vague language of general condemnation, rather than face the specific problem of anti-Christian discrimination and persecution. The report recommends that I instruct my officials to define this abuse and I believe we should do that by calling it out clearly with the label Christophobia. Boris Johnson, Hunt\u2019s rival for the Tory leadership, also welcomed the report. The report was published as a new poll said that 60% of Conservative members think Islam is \u201cgenerally a threat to Western civilisation\u201d. (See 1.29pm.) But the report itself said that its publication was not \u201ca stalking horse for the Islamophobic far right, nor does it give the Islamophobic right a stick to beat Islam with.\u201d Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, has said he wants to see \u201ca realignment of politics ... on the leave side\u201d. (See 11.29am.) The Brexiter Labour MP Kate Hoey has said she will stand down at the next election. (See 1.17pm.) Theresa May has been giving a series of farewell speeches, highlighting aspects of her premiership (\u201ccelebrating her legacy\u201d would probably be a bit of an exaggeration) and this morning she visited Northwood, which is home to both the Nato maritime HQ and the UK\u2019s permanent joint headquarters, where British military operations are masterminded. In her speech she praised the role played by the military, and she included a nice tribute to their families. Of course, other militaries are not the only partners involved in the success of our armed forces. In fact the most important partners are not in uniform at all \u2013 rather, they are the children, friends and families of the wider forces community, who do so much to support their loved ones who serve.It is not easy being part of the forces family. Not easy for children to move from school to school. Not easy for partners to build new careers and new friendships every time their loved one is redeployed. I cannot imagine how it must feel to wave goodbye to someone you care deeply about, knowing you won\u2019t see them again for many months \u2013 or even hear from them, if they are serving out of reach beneath the waves as part of our continuous at-sea deterrent. And none of us would wish to imagine how it feels to lose a loved one in the service of their country. Indeed, one of the hardest tasks of my premiership was finding the words to write to a young girl who would never know her father, after he was tragically killed in Iraq. So I want to take this opportunity to recognise the contribution that you make, and to thank each and every one of you for helping to make our armed forces the very best in the world. May has had to write very few letters to the relatives of members of the armed forces killed on active service. For her three predecessors, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron, this was a much more regular occurrence. Not everything in British life is getting worse. HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh says Katy Clark, the former Labour MP who now works for Jeremy Corbyn, is also seen as a potential replacement for Kate Hoey. There has been yet more polling which illustrates the somewhat hair-raising views of Conservative members towards Islam, including the finding that 60% believe the religion is \u201cgenerally a threat to Western civilisation\u201d. It comes via YouGov polling of party members, who are in the process of choosing the next prime minister, commissioned by the campaign group Hope Not Hate. The polling found only 17% believe Islam is \u201cgenerally compatible with Western civilisation\u201d\u2019, while 54% think the faith is \u201cgenerally a threat to the British way of life\u201d. Hope Not Hate released other findings from the same poll late last month which showed that nearly half of the 160,000-strong Tory membership would prefer not to have a Muslim prime minister, and 45% think some areas are not safe for non-Muslims. The extent of Islamophobia in the party has been an issue during the leadership campaign, with home secretary Sajid Javid getting other candidates to sign up to an independent inquiry into it, a commitment later seemingly watered down by Boris Johnson. An episode of Channel 4\u2019s Dispatches programme due to be broadcast on Monday evening has uncovered new anti-Islam comments by members. My colleague Jessica Elgot says Laura Parker, Momentum\u2019s national coordinator, is thought to be keen to replace Kate Hoey as MP for Vauxhall. The Labour MP Kate Hoey has announced that she is standing down at the next election. Aged 73, Hoey has been MP for Vauxhall in south London for 30 years. Hoey is one of the most prominent Brexiters in the Labour party, and she has repeatedly voted with the Tories in key votes on Brexit. We may get some more announcements today, because Labour has asked MPs to say by tonight whether or not they intend to stand again. Boris Johnson has posted a picture of himself on Twitter filling in his ballot paper for the Conservative leadership. The most interesting thing, I suspect, is the picture of the kitchen. After their row in her flat in Camberwell, details of which were leaked to the Guardian, Johnson and his girlfriend Carrie Symonds moved out, and since then it has not been clear where they have been living. This may be a clue. From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Oliver Milne There are two urgent questions in the Commons today. Lord Renwick, a British ambassador to the US in the 1990s, told Radio 5 Live\u2019s Emma Barnett that the Mail on Sunday leak meant Sir Kim Darroch\u2019s position as ambassador was now untenable. He explained: [Darroch] hasn\u2019t done anything wrong but his position has become untenable. There will of course be a decent interval. He will then have to be moved on. So the leaker has rendered his position untenable and you know, it has completely undermined any relationship of confidence he might have with Trump and his administration. That\u2019s not Darroch\u2019s fault, but we\u2019ve got to put a stop to this because every ambassador right now writing a cable to London is starting to wonder \u2018what is this going to look like if it ends up in the papers?\u2019 In an article for the Irish Times Simon Coveney, the Irish deputy prime minister and foreign minister, says the chances of a no-deal Brexit have \u201cnever been higher\u201d. Tomorrow the Irish cabinet will consider an update contingency action plan for no-deal, he says. He said people should not assume that, because Brexit has been delayed before, it will get delayed again. He says: We hope sensible evidence-based politics prevails over slogans in the UK, but we cannot bank on that. One of the biggest dangers Ireland faces in the weeks ahead is the \u201cboy who cried wolf\u201d effect, whereby people and business assume that because a disorderly Brexit was averted in March and April the same will happen in October. To assume this would be a serious error. The government isn\u2019t the only player in this. Businesses will need to ensure that they are prepared. Major multinational firms have done so, as have many Irish companies, but given the amount of small and medium enterprises in Ireland, not to mention their exposure to the UK market, we need to see concerted efforts by them in the weeks ahead. Coveney also says the backstop is not just about ensuring there is no physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. The backstop is much more than just avoiding physical infrastructure. It is also about avoiding related checks and controls, protecting North-South co-operation and the all-island economy, conditions that created tens of thousands of jobs, normalised relations on this island and sustained peace. This is a rebuke to British Brexiters who claim that \u201calternative arrangements\u201d, like those set out by the Alternative Arrangements Commission, could provide a substitute for the backstop. These are from the Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar who has been at the Downing Street lobby briefing. Nigel Farage, the leader of the Brexit party, was one of the first people out yesterday calling for Sir Kim Darroch to be sacked following the publication of the Mail on Sunday leak. He was on the Today programme this morning repeating that demand. But, given the Brexit party\u2019s strong showing in current opinion polls, what was more interesting was what he said about his desire to see a \u201ca realignment of politics ... on the leave side\u201d. Here are the main points from his interview. Farage said he wanted to see \u201ca realignment of politics ... on the leave side\u201d. Talking about the forthcoming Brecon and Radnorshire byelection, where Plaid Cymru and the Greens have decided to stand aside to give their fellow pro-remain allies, the Liberal Democrats, a better chance of winning, Farage said: The fact that the remain parties have got together virtually guarantees them a victory I would have thought in this seat. It\u2019s a formal Liberal Democrat seat. It\u2019s going to make it a very, very tough fight for us. And it gives leave voters a to think about. In Peterborough the Brexit party was the contender against the Labour party, and yet quite a lot of people still voted Conservative, and because of that Labour on 31% won. So at some point in time what I would like to see is a genuine realignment of politics, not just on the remain side, but on the leave side too. Farage was not pressed on this, and it was not clear what he meant by \u201crealignment\u201d. It could mean some form of Tory/Brexit party electoral pact. Or the Brexit party replacing the Conservatives. Or the Conservatives absorbing the Brexit party (which is what some Tories hope will happen under Boris Johnson, although you could argue that this will end up as a reverse takeover by the Brexit party). But the question is one that won\u2019t go away. In an article for Politico today, Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, says that the decision of the Lib Dems, Plaid and the Greens to cooperate in Brecon and Radnorshire is \u201ca beacon of political pragmatism\u201d, that the same thing could happen again in other contests, perhaps with the Lib Dems standing aside to help a pro-EU rival, and that this strategy \u201coffers a roadmap for building an effective anti-Brexit front that can save our country from lurching towards disaster\u201d. Farage dismissed the idea that he should be appointed ambassador to the US. Donald Trump suggested the idea in 2016, and there was some speculation yesterday that the Kim Darroch leak might be intended to create the opportunity for Boris Johnson to appoint Farage to this role (although the Johnson camp has dismissed the idea). Asked if he would accept the post if it were offered to him, Farage said he was \u201cnot a diplomat\u201d. He went on: I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the right man for that job. Am I the right man to try and help forge a better, closer relationship in terms of intelligence, security and trade with an administration that contains friends of mine? Yes, I could be very useful. He said that the civil service needed \u201cwholesale change\u201d because officials like Darroch were not sympathetic to the opportunities offered by Brexit and by having President Trump in the White House. He said he was trying to find some big UK industrialists willing to meet with Trump\u2019s trade advisers to prepare a blueprint for a UK-US trade deal. According to ITV\u2019s Washington correspondent, Robert Moore, \u201calmost everyone in this town [ie, Washington], even in the West Wing, shares [Kim] Darroch\u2019s analysis of the dysfunction and chaos in the White House.\u201d Here are the key points from what Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, said about the Kim Darroch leak at his press conference. Hunt praised the Trump administration as \u201chighly effective\u201d, saying he did not agree with his ambassador\u2019s assessment. The Mail on Sunday published extensive extracts yesterday from a series of cables sent by Sir Kim Darroch, the ambassador to the US, over the last two years, but it headlined on a comment from 2017 about the administration being \u201cinept\u201d. Hunt said he disagreed. He said: There are 13,000 people who work for the Foreign Office extremely bright, able, dedicated people. And we pay them as taxpayers to give us their frank assessment of the situation in the countries where they are serving, which is what our ambassador in Washington was doing. But it\u2019s a personal view. And there will be many people in this building who don\u2019t agree with that view. And, indeed, I don\u2019t agree with some of the views that we saw in those letters. I\u2019ve said I think the US administration is highly effective and we have the warmest of relationships, and a partnership based on standing up for shared values. And later he said: I made it clear that I don\u2019t share the ambassador\u2019s assessment of either the US administration or relations with the US administration. But Hunt also said it was important for ambassadors like Darroch to be able to give \u201cfrank views\u201d to ministers. He said: It\u2019s very important that our ambassadors and high commissioners around the world continue to feel that they are able to express those frank views. Because we have one of the best diplomatic networks in the world and the foundation of that is the free exchange of information and opinions, and the understanding that we are not always going to agree with each other, but we want to know what people around the world are thinking. He said he was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the leak because he wanted diplomats to be sure they could continue to give frank advice in confidence. He said he hoped the leak inquiry discovered who was responsible, and that if it did there would be \u201cvery serious consequences\u201d. Speaking at his press conference at the Foreign Office, Jeremy Hunt has said that he does not agree with everything Sir Kim Darroch, the ambassador to Washington, said in the cables leaked to the Mail on Sunday. But he has said that it is important for diplomats to be able to express their views frankly. Here are three foreign policy experts on the Kim Darroch leak. From the historian Timothy Garton Ash From Edward Luce, the Financial Times\u2019 US national editor From the Economist\u2019s David Rennie Sir Kim Darroch, the British ambassador to Washington whose private views on the merits of Donald Trump and his administration were leaked to the Mail on Sunday yesterday, has attracted the wrath of the president. \u201cThe ambassador has not served the UK well, I can tell you that,\u201d said Trump when asked about Darroch\u2019s comments, which were actually relatively mild in comparison with some of the things that have said about Trump, and certainly in line with most mainstream European commentary on Washington. \u201cWe are not big fans of that man,\u201d Trump went on. But Darroch won the backing of the UK government this morning. Speaking on the Today programme, Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, defended Darroch strongly and insisted that there was no reason why he should now have to quit. And while Fox said that he would be apologising to the Trump administration for the fact that Darroch\u2019s views were leaked, he indicated that he would not be apologising for what Darroch actually said. Here are the main points from the interview. Fox said the leak of Darroch\u2019s memos, and even Trump\u2019s criticism of him, would not stop him being able to carry on as the British ambassador. Fox said he knew from his widespread contacts in Washington that Darroch was held in high regard. Asked if Darroch would be able to remain in post, Fox said: With the widespread contacts that I have in Washington and in the administration and amongst congressional leaders, [I know] our ambassador is held in high regard ... It\u2019s not a problem with the ambassador. This is a problem with the ethics of the individual who carried out this particular leak. If people start to want to leak confidential information - leaving aside whether or not it may be a criminal activity - it certainly makes it much more difficult to be able to have the bond of trust within which we can operate in an optimal way. When it was put to him that Trump would find it difficult to work with Darroch in future, Fox replied: Well, I think that who we have as our diplomats is of course a matter for us. And I don\u2019t see, frankly, that this is an impediment to the ambassador being able to work in Washington. He defended Darroch\u2019s right to give his honest assessment of the Trump administration, although he said Darroch\u2019s views weren\u2019t the same as the government\u2019s. He said: I do know that the views that that were in our newspapers [ie, in the Darroch memos] don\u2019t reflect the views of the government. But that\u2019s not the role of the diplomatic service. They\u2019re there to make an assessment on a day to day basis. They send regular reports back. Obviously they vary over time. And they add colour so that politicians in London can get a feel for what\u2019s going on elsewhere. The same will happen with the American ambassador reporting back to Washington. He said he would be apologising to the US administration for the fact that Darroch\u2019s views were leaked, but not for what he said. He is due to meet Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter, and asked if he would be apologising, he replied: I will be apologising for the fact that either our civil service or elements of our political class have not lived up to the expectations that either we have or the United States has about their behaviour, which in this particular case has lapsed in a most extraordinary and unacceptable way. Fox described the leak as \u201cunconscionable\u201d. He said: Malicious leaks of this nature are unprofessional. They are unethical. And they are unpatriotic. Because they can actually lead to damage to that relationship which can, therefore, affect our security interests. I think it is unconscionable that any professional person in either politics of the civil service can behave in this way. He said he hoped the leaker was caught and punished. He said: This is such a damaging, potentially damaging, event, that I hope the full force of our internal discipline, or even the law, will come down on whoever actually carried out this particular act. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary and Tory leadership candidate, holds a press conference to launch a report saying the government should be prepared to impose sanctions against countries that persecute Christians. Morning: Theresa May gives a speech on the role of the armed forces at the Nato/UK military HQ at Northwood. After 3.30pm: A Foreign Office minister is expected to make a Commons statement or answer an urgent question about the Kim Darroch leak. 3.45pm: John Benger, clerk of the House of Commons, gives evidence to the Commons privileges committee about contempt of parliament. 4.15pm: Steven Armstrong, chairman of Ford Europe, gives evidence to the Commons Welsh affairs committee about the closure of Ford\u2019s Bridgend plant. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary at lunchtime and then another when I finish. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

You have to live it, day in, day out.\u201d</p> <p>Sam\u2019s long list of her son\u2019s symptoms, which include sleep issues, manic behaviours, depression and low social maturity, is balanced by an equally long list of what she appreciatively calls his \u201chighest qualities\u201d: his creativity, his IT skills, his loyalty to friends and \u201cmassive heart\u201d. She is clearly a loving, attentive mother who is highly attuned to her son\u2019s needs. At some point, when her little boy has sufficient emotional maturity and stability, she will need to muster all of those qualities to explain to him his diagnosis.</p> <p>It is the ultimate discharge of maternal responsibility, but Sam worries that the disclosure may take her away \u201cas his one safe person. This is what secondary alcohol use has created in my family,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Even when a person harmed by secondary drinking acts to intercept the repercussions, the psychological impact can be inescapable. In 2014, <a href=\"https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest/family-of-missing-leeds-man-kalist-musinga-informed-after-body-found-in-lake-1-7091550\" title=\"\">Jabz Musinga\u2019s father</a> died after falling into the River Aire in Leeds. It took several weeks for his body to surface, but Jabz, 25, knew what had happened as soon as she saw the security video of her dad walking drunkenly beside the water.</p> <p>The certainty must have felt strange, because she had spent her childhood \u201con tenterhooks\u201d. What she had witnessed in her own home, her father\u2019s behaviour, \u201ccarried into my adult life, trickled into my dating life\u201d, she says. \u201cI had low standards of what to expect from a guy, and even from friends. People easily took advantage of me.\u201d</p> <p>She soon found herself in an abusive relationship. \u201cIt was very brief. I put my foot down straightaway. It was like two weeks and I said: \u2018This is not going to work.\u2019\u201d She was thankful, she says, that she was \u201cable to stop\u201d \u2013 which suggests that she may also have been able to continue. It took a particular conviction to intercede.</p> <p>\u201cIt was very hard to say: \u2018I\u2019ve been affected by someone else\u2019s drinking,\u2019\u201d Jabz says. \u201cThe focus tends to be on people who have addictions,\u201d not those around them. But she has no doubt that alcohol changed her. \u201cIt shaped my personality. I would be a completely different person if it hadn\u2019t happened. I do think about it, once in a while \u2013 the person I would have been,\u201d she says, as if a ghost self shadows her. \u201cI think I would have been more confident. Maybe a better person.\u201d</p> <p>Jabz sounds adjusted and happy in her life, but that last note of self-rebuke recalls the words of the MP <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/liambyrne\" title=\"\">Liam Byrne</a>, another child of an alcoholic father and a patron for the <a href=\"https://www.nacoa.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Association for Children of Alcoholics</a> (NACOA), a charity that Jabz volunteers for. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s normal, so you construct these perfect templates of what you think good looks like,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Self-medicating with perfectionism, Byrne wrote \u201clong lists of attributes\u201d to live up to \u2013 \u201ca blueprint for being a superhuman with super powers\u201d. He is 48 now. How old was he when he wrote his last list? He sighs heavily. \u201cForty-three? Forty-four?\u201d</p> <p>Secondhand drinking covers such a spectrum of human experience that a wide range of measures is required to confront it. Byrne, whose experiences have helped him to connect with the homeless population of the West Midlands, where he is campaigning to be mayor, points out that about 2.5 million children in the UK have an alcoholic parent, and 50% of these \u201cgo on to develop problems themselves\u201d. Greater education of frontline workers with children, including teachers and GPs, would help \u2013 something that the all-party parliamentary group <a href=\"https://liambyrne.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Children-of-Alcoholics-A-Manifesto-for-Change-pages.pdf\" title=\"\">Children of Alcoholics</a>, which he founded, is working to change.</p> <p>Witty, who is now the president of the charity <a href=\"https://www.madd.org/\" title=\"\">Mothers Against Drunk Driving</a>, would like stiffer laws against underage drinking. Sam would like more support for children with FASD \u2013 and their mothers. At present, nearly 80% of the NHS\u2019s clinical commissioning groups do not provide diagnosis for children with FASD, according to a freedom of information request by the National Organisation for Foetal Alcohol Syndrome-UK. Karriker-Jaffe is interested in the degree to which \u201cnegative impacts for people with heavy drinkers in their lives appear to be stronger for women than men\u201d. But why can\u2019t all the harms of secondhand drinking be addressed with the same sort of legislative determination that denormalised secondhand smoking?</p> <p>\u201cA single act, if I had a wish, would be to introduce a minimum unit price combined with increasing duty on alcohol,\u201d says Gilmore, of the Alcohol Health Alliance. He cites the \u201c<a href=\"http://www.ias.org.uk/What-we-do/Alcohol-Alert/Issue-3-2013/Alcohol-Duty-Escalator-Scrapped.aspx\" title=\"\">duty escalator</a>\u201d, introduced by the Labour government in 2008, pushing up duty on alcohol by 2% above inflation year on year. \u201cThat was the first time we saw outcomes like cirrhosis deaths plateau off and begin to fall. Unfortunately, George Osborne as chancellor removed that duty escalator.</p> <p>\u201c[With cigarettes] we have relentlessly pushed the price up.\u201d Gilmore points out. \u201cQuietly, but relentlessly. And that\u2019s made a huge impact. The UK is the leading European country in reducing smoking rates. The government has a real opportunity to show it is at the forefront of reducing alcohol-related harm, including harm to others. It needs to stop leaving alcohol to the free market like soap powder and treat it as a potentially serious health risk, as it has done with tobacco.\u201d</p> <p>There are differences between smoking and drinking, of course. More than 90% of the 181 governments to have signed up to the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/fctc/reporting/WHO-FCTC-2018_global_progress_report.pdf?ua=1\" title=\"\">World Health Organi</a><a href=\"https://www.who.int/fctc/reporting/WHO-FCTC-2018_global_progress_report.pdf?ua=1\" title=\"\">zation\u2019s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control</a> (WHOFCTC) have implemented some form of smoking ban; Article 8, which relates to secondhand smoking, is the most implemented of all WHOFCTC articles. But with alcohol, the desired outcomes \u2013 the appropriate limits \u2013 are more variable, more open to discussion. And no doubt the normalisation of alcohol in an array of social situations, from family celebrations to weekend binges, means that its abuse remains highly stigmatised: a harmless pursuit that has simply exceeded control.</p> <p>\u201cPeople say that if you smoke you harm others, but with alcohol you only harm yourself,\u201d says Amy, 30. She vehemently disagrees. Her sister began to drink in her early 20s \u2013 just \u201chaving a wild weekend\u201d, as medical staff initially described it to the family. Within seven years, she died of heart failure. \u201cAnyone else who had a terminal illness would have an abundance of understanding from friends, colleagues. But you don\u2019t have that support,\u201d Amy says. \u201cIn fact, you don\u2019t have the ability to talk about it without stigma.\u201d</p> <p>Amy, who is from south Wales and volunteers for the charity <a href=\"https://alcoholchange.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Alcohol Change UK</a>, was training for a new job while her sister\u2019s condition deteriorated. \u201cI\u2019d be in the hospital, then come straight to work as if nothing had happened. I work in a fairly professional environment, and I know it sounds silly, but I wouldn\u2019t want it [her sister\u2019s alcoholism] to impact on people\u2019s view of me as a professional,\u201d she says.</p> <p>She is not alone. The day after we speak, Karriker-Jaffe emails to say that she would like to alter her answer about her own experience of secondhand drinking. \u201cI watched an extended family member struggle with an alcohol use disorder that I believe eventually contributed to her death,\u201d she says. \u201cI think about her often in relation to this work.\u201d Karriker-Jaffe adds that she is unsure why she did not mention this on the phone. \u201cStigma, I suppose.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c2cdbc4da66177e6aba4099484c723307c1ff34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c2cdbc4da66177e6aba4099484c723307c1ff34/192_0_8476_5792/1000.jpg\" alt=\"PThe MP Liam Byrne.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"683\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">PThe MP Liam Byrne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Gardner/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her revelation, as an expert in this field, suggests that alcohol abuse, and the harms of secondhand drinking, need to be destigmatised in order for its scale<em> </em>to be properly confronted. In the UK, it is widely seen as deplorable to smoke in the company of children \u2013 but even the most conscientious parents display few qualms about drinking. Does it matter, for instance, if children see a parent habitually reach for a glass of wine to de-stress? Byrne laughs drily. \u201cIt does, yeah. Because you need to be able to model self-care.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe need to reframe what we believe is problem drinking,\u201d agrees <a href=\"https://www.joshconnolly.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Josh Connolly</a>, a life, leadership and performance coach who has experienced secondhand drinking as the child of an alcoholic parent, and as an alcoholic parent himself. \u201cI say: come away from quantity and how often you are doing it. Because if your children know you get them to bed, get the wine out, have one glass of wine and relax, what they see is that they can\u2019t help you relax: you go and get a glass of wine. It\u2019s about the behaviours, the feelings that alcohol use creates.\u201d</p> <p>Twelve-step programmes, including that of Alcoholics Anonymous, helped Connolly eliminate alcohol from his life. But, in his sober years, he has found that his presence can make drinkers feel uncomfortable in their relationship with alcohol \u2013 and this, he thinks, is where everyone who enjoys alcohol could benefit from some self-appraisal.</p> <p>\u201cThe strange thing, as somebody who is seven and a half years sober, is that I now face more stigma from society for not drinking than I did as a dad who drank,\u201d he says. No doubt this reluctance to examine our relationship with alcohol helps to make secondhand drinking so hard to acknowledge. As he says: \u201cSociety doesn\u2019t have a line to cross on this. So how is an individual going to have one?\u201d</p> <p>Maybe it is time to explore not only the ways in which we have, as individuals, experienced a secondhand harm from alcohol \u2013 but also those in which we may have perpetrated one.</p>",

Maybe a better person.\u201d Jabz sounds adjusted and happy in her life, but that last note of self-rebuke recalls the words of the MP Liam Byrne, another child of an alcoholic father and a patron for the National Association for Children of Alcoholics (NACOA), a charity that Jabz volunteers for. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s normal, so you construct these perfect templates of what you think good looks like,\u201d he says. Self-medicating with perfectionism, Byrne wrote \u201clong lists of attributes\u201d to live up to \u2013 \u201ca blueprint for being a superhuman with super powers\u201d. He is 48 now. How old was he when he wrote his last list? He sighs heavily. \u201cForty-three? Forty-four?\u201d Secondhand drinking covers such a spectrum of human experience that a wide range of measures is required to confront it. Byrne, whose experiences have helped him to connect with the homeless population of the West Midlands, where he is campaigning to be mayor, points out that about 2.5 million children in the UK have an alcoholic parent, and 50% of these \u201cgo on to develop problems themselves\u201d. Greater education of frontline workers with children, including teachers and GPs, would help \u2013 something that the all-party parliamentary group Children of Alcoholics, which he founded, is working to change. Witty, who is now the president of the charity Mothers Against Drunk Driving, would like stiffer laws against underage drinking. Sam would like more support for children with FASD \u2013 and their mothers. At present, nearly 80% of the NHS\u2019s clinical commissioning groups do not provide diagnosis for children with FASD, according to a freedom of information request by the National Organisation for Foetal Alcohol Syndrome-UK. Karriker-Jaffe is interested in the degree to which \u201cnegative impacts for people with heavy drinkers in their lives appear to be stronger for women than men\u201d. But why can\u2019t all the harms of secondhand drinking be addressed with the same sort of legislative determination that denormalised secondhand smoking? \u201cA single act, if I had a wish, would be to introduce a minimum unit price combined with increasing duty on alcohol,\u201d says Gilmore, of the Alcohol Health Alliance. He cites the \u201cduty escalator\u201d, introduced by the Labour government in 2008, pushing up duty on alcohol by 2% above inflation year on year. \u201cThat was the first time we saw outcomes like cirrhosis deaths plateau off and begin to fall. Unfortunately, George Osborne as chancellor removed that duty escalator. \u201c[With cigarettes] we have relentlessly pushed the price up.\u201d Gilmore points out. \u201cQuietly, but relentlessly. And that\u2019s made a huge impact. The UK is the leading European country in reducing smoking rates. The government has a real opportunity to show it is at the forefront of reducing alcohol-related harm, including harm to others. It needs to stop leaving alcohol to the free market like soap powder and treat it as a potentially serious health risk, as it has done with tobacco.\u201d There are differences between smoking and drinking, of course. More than 90% of the 181 governments to have signed up to the World Health Organization\u2019s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHOFCTC) have implemented some form of smoking ban; Article 8, which relates to secondhand smoking, is the most implemented of all WHOFCTC articles. But with alcohol, the desired outcomes \u2013 the appropriate limits \u2013 are more variable, more open to discussion. And no doubt the normalisation of alcohol in an array of social situations, from family celebrations to weekend binges, means that its abuse remains highly stigmatised: a harmless pursuit that has simply exceeded control. \u201cPeople say that if you smoke you harm others, but with alcohol you only harm yourself,\u201d says Amy, 30. She vehemently disagrees. Her sister began to drink in her early 20s \u2013 just \u201chaving a wild weekend\u201d, as medical staff initially described it to the family. Within seven years, she died of heart failure. \u201cAnyone else who had a terminal illness would have an abundance of understanding from friends, colleagues. But you don\u2019t have that support,\u201d Amy says. \u201cIn fact, you don\u2019t have the ability to talk about it without stigma.\u201d Amy, who is from south Wales and volunteers for the charity Alcohol Change UK, was training for a new job while her sister\u2019s condition deteriorated. \u201cI\u2019d be in the hospital, then come straight to work as if nothing had happened. I work in a fairly professional environment, and I know it sounds silly, but I wouldn\u2019t want it [her sister\u2019s alcoholism] to impact on people\u2019s view of me as a professional,\u201d she says. She is not alone. The day after we speak, Karriker-Jaffe emails to say that she would like to alter her answer about her own experience of secondhand drinking. \u201cI watched an extended family member struggle with an alcohol use disorder that I believe eventually contributed to her death,\u201d she says. \u201cI think about her often in relation to this work.\u201d Karriker-Jaffe adds that she is unsure why she did not mention this on the phone. \u201cStigma, I suppose.\u201d Her revelation, as an expert in this field, suggests that alcohol abuse, and the harms of secondhand drinking, need to be destigmatised in order for its scale to be properly confronted. In the UK, it is widely seen as deplorable to smoke in the company of children \u2013 but even the most conscientious parents display few qualms about drinking. Does it matter, for instance, if children see a parent habitually reach for a glass of wine to de-stress? Byrne laughs drily. \u201cIt does, yeah. Because you need to be able to model self-care.\u201d \u201cWe need to reframe what we believe is problem drinking,\u201d agrees Josh Connolly, a life, leadership and performance coach who has experienced secondhand drinking as the child of an alcoholic parent, and as an alcoholic parent himself. \u201cI say: come away from quantity and how often you are doing it. Because if your children know you get them to bed, get the wine out, have one glass of wine and relax, what they see is that they can\u2019t help you relax: you go and get a glass of wine. It\u2019s about the behaviours, the feelings that alcohol use creates.\u201d Twelve-step programmes, including that of Alcoholics Anonymous, helped Connolly eliminate alcohol from his life. But, in his sober years, he has found that his presence can make drinkers feel uncomfortable in their relationship with alcohol \u2013 and this, he thinks, is where everyone who enjoys alcohol could benefit from some self-appraisal. \u201cThe strange thing, as somebody who is seven and a half years sober, is that I now face more stigma from society for not drinking than I did as a dad who drank,\u201d he says. No doubt this reluctance to examine our relationship with alcohol helps to make secondhand drinking so hard to acknowledge. As he says: \u201cSociety doesn\u2019t have a line to cross on this. So how is an individual going to have one?\u201d Maybe it is time to explore not only the ways in which we have, as individuals, experienced a secondhand harm from alcohol \u2013 but also those in which we may have perpetrated one.",

His grand finale is the \u201cvogue\u201d, nothing like actual vogueing (because, hands) but a head sway side to side, with, am I imagining it, just a little bit of sassy attitude? And one foot raised upwards as if to casually say, I\u2019m owning this. Five stars for novelty, for sure. But I think we\u2019d all like to see a better synthesis of material and a greater development of choreographic ideas. I mean, what is he really saying about the art form in the 21st century? There\u2019s time for him to work on that. Sulphur-crested cockatoos can live for up to 80 years in captivity, so Snowball has many dancing days left yet.",

This surely won\u2019t be the last we see of the magnificent Coco Gauff, even though she\u2019s come up short against the magnificent Simona Halep today. Hopefully the 15-year-old cherishes the adoring whistles and cheers from the Court 1 crowd as she takes her leave.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a919b9aa34c30bd8e9d9624f085c9de0798dc8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a919b9aa34c30bd8e9d9624f085c9de0798dc8a/0_0_3500_2417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simona Halep celebrates after defeating Gauff.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"691\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simona Halep celebrates after defeating Gauff.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony O\u2019Brien/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-08T14:55:37.586Z\">at 3.55pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d2356438f08d0b6ca52c696\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-08T14:46:08.723Z\">3.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Second set: Halep 6-3, 5-3 Gauff* (*denotes server): </strong>Serving to stay in the match, Gauff looks forlorn.

Whatever it was I assume the answer isn\u2019t: starring in front of millions in one of the most famous sporting events in the world. But don\u2019t get too down. The thing about genius is it\u2019s meant to be unique. There\u2019s really no point judging yourself against the achievements of Coco Gauff; you might as well be kicking yourself for not being able to swim faster than a shark. </p> <p>What a talent. What a story. It\u2019s not often you get to see something like this unfold before your very eyes. But here we are. And this is happening. Just over a week ago only tennis nerds had heard of Coco Gauff. Now even people with no interest in sport have an interest in her. She\u2019s beaten Venus Williams, she\u2019s dealt with Magdalena Rybarikova, she\u2019s dealt with adversity against Polona Hercog - and now, at the grand old age of 15, she meets Simona Halep for a place in the last eight of Wimbledon.</p> <p>It promises to be fascinating. But it will also be by far the biggest test Gauff has faced so far. Halep, tough, experienced, very good, is a former No 1 and won the French Open last year. She starts as the favourite. The logical favourite, that is. Not the crowd\u2019s favourite. Not the world\u2019s favourite. No. We are all loco for Coco at the moment.</p> <p><strong>Play starts</strong> on Court 1 soon.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-08T13:15:52.860Z\">at 2.15pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

At 15-all she takes control with one and makes Halep run with a volley. Halep scoots forward and dabs a forehand wide. She wastes another challenge on it. Two big forehands turn the game lift Halep to deuce, but Gauff keeps forcing the issue by coming to the net and that tactic helps her to deuce. Yet Halep holds. First set: Halep 4-3 Gauff* (*denotes server): The first two points are shared. And it goes to deuce. Gauff is finding it tough to deal with Halep\u2019s defensive skills. It keeps coming back at you. But Gauff is undeterred. She holds on and hangs in there. In her box her parents look pensive. First set: Halep* 4-2 Gauff (*denotes server): There\u2019s no sign of Gauff giving up. But Halep\u2019s such a hustler. Gauff drills a cracking backhand down the line, but Halep hunts it down and seals the game with a crosscourt forehand sliced winner. First set: Halep 3-2 Gauff* (*denotes server): There\u2019s trouble for Gauff when Halep, ignoring the noise, plays some of her best stuff to move into a 0-30 lead. Gauff\u2019s response is a razor-sharp forehand for 15-30. Gauff gets it back to 30-all, but Halep earns a break point. Gauff saves it with a backhand that lands right on the line. Reminder: 15 years old. Another reminder: Halep has seen it all. A drive volley brings up another break point. But Gauff shrugs her shoulders and produces a calm-as-you-like volley for deuce, delivered with such nonchalance, you feel it should be illegal. But Halep keeps banging on the door and the pressure tells when Gauff misjudges a backhand, slapping it into the net. First set: Halep* 2-2 Gauff (*denotes server): Now it\u2019s Halep who looks jittery, a double-fault at 15-30 handing Gauff two break points. However Halep saves the first, banging a backhand away to get Gauff running, then barrelling forward to win the point. Then 30-40 becomes deuce, Gauff sending a forehand long. Halep holds when she overpowers Gauff with a big backhand. First set: Halep 1-2 Gauff* (*denotes server): Gauff settles into this one quickly, piercing strikes making it 30-0. A 119mph serve forces a duff return from Halep for 40-0. She holds to 15. First set: Halep* 1-1 Gauff (*denotes server): The game goes to 30, signalling Gauff\u2019s determination not to get too down on herself. Soon Gauff has a break point. Halep will give you chances on serve - Gauff breaks back when she outlasts the Romanian in a long baseline rally. First set: Halep 1-0 Gauff* (*denotes server): It\u2019s the youngster to open the serving on Court 1 - and they begin with an intense baseline rally, ending with a backhand winner from Gauff. But the nerves creep in, taking hold, errors giving Halep two break points. Halep can\u2019t take the first, missing a forehand. The next rally\u2019s absorbing. But it goes Halep\u2019s way when Gauff, charging to the net, decides to leave a slice from the Romanian and watches in horror as it lands well inside the line. Well, that\u2019s not the start she wanted. Tok! Tok! Tok! They\u2019re knocking up. Here in the media centre there\u2019s a huge queue for Court 1 passes. Everyone wants to see her. They\u2019re on court. Coco Gauff and some other player. Just kidding. Simona Halep\u2019s bloody brilliant. Big fan of Halep over here. The little Romanian\u2019s a class act. Pre-match reading Hello. What were you doing when you were 15? Whatever it was I assume the answer isn\u2019t: starring in front of millions in one of the most famous sporting events in the world. But don\u2019t get too down. The thing about genius is it\u2019s meant to be unique. There\u2019s really no point judging yourself against the achievements of Coco Gauff; you might as well be kicking yourself for not being able to swim faster than a shark. What a talent. What a story. It\u2019s not often you get to see something like this unfold before your very eyes. But here we are. And this is happening. Just over a week ago only tennis nerds had heard of Coco Gauff. Now even people with no interest in sport have an interest in her. She\u2019s beaten Venus Williams, she\u2019s dealt with Magdalena Rybarikova, she\u2019s dealt with adversity against Polona Hercog - and now, at the grand old age of 15, she meets Simona Halep for a place in the last eight of Wimbledon. It promises to be fascinating. But it will also be by far the biggest test Gauff has faced so far. Halep, tough, experienced, very good, is a former No 1 and won the French Open last year. She starts as the favourite. The logical favourite, that is. Not the crowd\u2019s favourite. Not the world\u2019s favourite. No. We are all loco for Coco at the moment. Play starts on Court 1 soon.",

      "bodyText": "Stage report: As the Tour entered France for the first time this year, Julian Philippe was the source of much gallic pride after securing victory and the overall lead, courtesy of a late breakaway. Jersey wearers after stage three Those in charge of the Tour stopwatch are dilly-dallying over the General Classification, but for the time being, here are your wearers of the jerseys that matter ... Yellow: Julian Alaphilippe (Quick Step) Green: Peter Sagan (Bora-Hansgroe) Polka-dot: Tim Wellens (Lotto Soudal) White: Wout van Aert (Jumbo Visma) Julian Alaphilippe speaks: \u201cI\u2019m speechless,\u201d says the stage winner and new race leader. \u201cI don\u2019t realise what\u2019s happening to me. I knew this stage suited me. I managed to avoid any pitfalls and crashes. I felt good so I accelerated in the Mutigny climb but I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d go alone. I gave everything. I heard I was 30 or 40 seconds ahead. It\u2019s difficult to meet the expectations being the favourite. I made it. I\u2019m delighted.\u201d Stage three result 1. Julian Alaphilippe (Deceuninck-Quick Step) +26sec 2. Michael Matthews (Sunweb) +26sec 3. Jasper Stuyven (Trek\u2013Segafredo) +26sec 4. Greg Van Avermaet (CCC) +26sec 5. Peter Sagan (Bora Hansgrohe) +26sec But has the French Quick Step rider done enough to secure the yellow jersey? We\u2019ll find out soon enough. The ramp to the finish is brutal and those chasing Alaphilippe aren\u2019t quite quick enough to prevent him from securing the race leader\u2019s jersey. 1km to go: Alaphilippe\u2019s knees keep pumping with Team Ineos\u2019s Michal Kwiatkowski leading the chasing pack. The gap is 34 seconds. Alaphilippe should be able to win the stage, but he may not finish the day in yellow. 4km to go: Unsurprisingly, Tim Wellens will be awarded today\u2019s combativity prize after his heroics earlier today. Alaphilippe\u2019s lead over the chasing pack is down to less than 30 seconds. He may have the yellow jersey snatched from his grasp, after all. 7km to go: Julian Alaphilippe is the virtual Tour leader by 31 seconds, but still has a punchy finish to negotiate to guarantee getting the maillot jaune today. 10km to go: On the downhill, Julian Alaphilippe is 50 seconds clear of four chasing riders: Max Schachmann, Michael Woods, Mikel Landa and Alexey Lutsenko. 15km to go: Wellens is caught by Quick Step\u2019s Julian Alaphilippe, who has attacked off the front of the bunch and is riding away. Wellens was first over the climb and takes the eight seconds available, but immediately steps off his bike with a mechanical. Alaphilippe was second over and gets five. Michael Woods (EF Education First) was third over the summit and got two. 16km to go: Wout van Aert leads the chasing bunch up the final climb and can see Wellens in the distance. After a brave effort, the Belgian is about to be caught. 15km to go: With a lead of 53 seconds, Wellens hits the final classified climb of the day. It\u2019s a leg-burning 900 metres high at 8% to the finish. 16km to go: Wearing the white jersey for best young rider, Teunissen\u2019s Jumbo-Visma team-mate, Wout van Aert, is nicely placed at the front of the bunch and could take the yellow jersey with a decent finish today. It would be an impressive feat, three days into his first Grand Tour. 19km to go: Mike Teunissen continues to cling on at the back of the bunch, but it looks like he\u2019ll be losing the yellow jersey. Wellens pedals his way towards the final classified climb of the day, where the bonus seconds I mentioned earlier are up for grabs. 25km to go: Wearing the yellow jersey, Mike Teunissen is struggling at the back of the bunch. The gap from Wellens, who has just taken two more King of the Mountains points, to the peloton is closing and is now just 1min 09sec. The riders of Astana are currently leading the chase. 26km to go: We\u2019re on the second of the four classified climbs and the big guns are hitting the front of the bunch. Assorted sprinters are being shelled out the back and are forming the first grupetto of this year\u2019s Tour. The roads are narrow, the scenery is beautiful and the gap between stage leader Tim Wellens and the chasing pack is 1min 16sec. 29km to go: Tony Martin is human after all! Having done the work of about 10 men today, he finally cracks and drops out of the back. The gap to Wellens is 1min 27sec and the race for the stage win is on in earnest. 31km to go: Behind Wellens, about half the bunch is struggling to keep up and are seriously strung out on the road. The gap is 1min 58sec, the road is exposed and there\u2019s a bit of a cross-wind. Team Jumbo-Visma had been at the front of the bunch but are currently being crowded out as their rivals jockey for position. They\u2019re about to catch the four breakaway riders that were recently left behind by Wellens. Bora and Quick Step are are at the front of the bunch. 33km to go: With the race in the Champagne region, Tim Wellens, the 28-year-old from Belgium, continues to make the running and is 2min 24sec clear of the main bunch. If he takes the next available King of the Mountains point, he\u2019ll be zipped into the polka-dot jersey later this afternoon. On Eurosport, Sean Kelly suggests he may well win the stage as well. \u201cHe just needs to put his head down, give it his all and concentrate on what he\u2019s doing.\u201d 37km to go: Wellens has gone over a minute clear of the breakaway he was once part of. His team have said they have no General Classification plans for this Tour, but will attempt to pick up stage wins and other prizes as they see fit. Wellens may or may not win today\u2019s stage, but he could find himself on the podium in the polka-dot jersey for King of the Mountains. 39km to go: Tim Wellens (Lotto Soudal) leads the stage and is 2min 28sec clear of the peloton. On the road between them, there rolls a group of four riders in whose company Wellens spent most of the day before bidding them farewell and heading off into the distance. 43km to go: Tim Wellens tackles the first of four classified climbs towards the end of today\u2019s stage. He\u2019s 45 seconds clear of the four chaps who were with him the breakaway and 2min 30sec ahead of the bunch. Wellens is a two-time stage winner at the Giro but has never won a stage in the Tour de France. 44km to go: \u201cYou don\u2019t think Tony Martin might be on a long solo breakaway, and just hasn\u2019t noticed the peloton behind him, do you?\u201d asks Bob O\u2019Hara. 47km to go: Wellens opens a gap of 17 seconds on his former travelling companions on the climb up Nanteuil-la-Foret. At the back of the race, Romain Bardet (AG2R La Mondiale) is being paced back to the bunch by his entire team after suffering a mechanical. 48km to go: Like some sort of Lycra-clad terminator, Tony Martin (Jumbo-Visma), continues to tow the peloton along as they chase the five leading riders. At the front of the race, Tim Wellens (Lotto-Soiudal has just attacked off the front of the breakaway. 50km to go: Now Thibaut Pinot (Groupama\u2013FDJ) is being paced back to the bunch after getting a puncture. He and a team-mate make their way through the support cars tailing peloton so he can re-attach and begin the next job of trying to make his way to the front. 55km to go: A few riders get squeezed out of the bunch and into an adjacent field as the rush to get to the front of the bunch intensifies, with the lumpy stuff very much ahoy!!! The gap between our front five and the chasing pack is a mite under two minutes. 59km to go: A contender for today\u2019s stage, Michael Matthews, of Team Sunweb, is being paced back to the bunch after being held up by a minor crash as the bunch went through Betheny. Paddy Bevin (CCC) hit the deck but is back on his bike. 62km to go: The gap is down to 1min 47sec. There\u2019s a time bonus available today, on the final climb of the day, the C\u00f4te de Mutigny, which is 900 metres. This is new wheeze, in which the Tour organisers have decided to award eight seconds to the first rider to reach eight specified summits in this year\u2019s race. The second and third riders to reach them will get five and two seconds respectively. The first of today\u2019s four climbs is coming up in 20 kilometres. 70km to go: The gap is down to two minutes as the process of reeling in the five-man breakaway of Tim Wellens (Lotto-Soudal), Anthony Delaplace (Arkea-Samsic), Yoann Offredo (Wanty-Groupe Gobert), Paul Ourselin (Total Direct Energie) and Stephane Rossetto (Cofidis) begins. Mark Cavendish misses out: The omission of Mark Cavendish from Team Dimension Data\u2019s race line-up was a source of much pre-race controversy. The Manx sprinter, who has 30 stage wins to his name, did not feature on the start list for the first time since making his debut in 2007. \u201cIt is understood that Dimension Data\u2019s head of performance, Rolf Aldag, wanted to select Cavendish but was overruled by the team principal, Doug Ryder, who instead made the final call on a squad which includes Britain\u2019s Steve Cummings, 38, and the Danish rider Lars Bak, 39,\u201d wrote the Guardian when the team was announced. It has since been reported that Aldag considered walking away from the Tour and his job on the back of Ryder\u2019s decision, but he decided to stay on. \u201cWe have to do what\u2019s good for the team, what\u2019s good for the eight riders,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m obligated to do that. If it\u2019s the best for me to do that, to help them with my experience of 27 Tours de France than that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. I think everybody has to judge himself on whether he can be helpful or not helpful, and in every Tour de France that is the case for me. \u201cDo I contribute or not contribute? The situation for me is to help the eight guys here and that is what I will focus on. I can\u2019t really be distracted. It doesn\u2019t matter what happened if and when and how so I would just like to put that story to bed and move forward.\u201d 85km to go: The gap between the breakaway and the bunch is at 3min 16sec and Tony Martin is putting in another shift at the front of the peloton. Apologies for briefly abandoning you, but I was in danger of suffering what cyclists call the \u201cbonk\u201d or \u201chunger knock\u201d and don\u2019t have a support team to feed me treats, energy gels and protein bars in a musette. 92km to go: Tim Wellens (Lotto-Soudal), Anthony Delaplace (Arkea-Samsic), Yoann Offredo (Wanty-Groupe Gobert), Paul Ourselin (Total Direct Energie) and Stephane Rossetto (Cofidis) are in the breakaway as assorted teams jockey for position at the front of the bunch, which is 3min 09sec. I\u2019ll be back in 10 minutes, if not sooner, to bring you the business end of today\u2019s stage. While I\u2019m away, here\u2019s some more top Global Cycling Network content to keep you entertained. 96km to go: At the back of the bunch, Astana rider Jakob Fuglsang has been getting treatment for an elbow injury which he suffered when face-planting in the opening stage. Fuglsang had to get stitches on an eye injury and hurt an elbow and a knee after being brought down towards the end of the first stage. 102km to go: In the green jersey today because Mike Teunissen, the rightful owner, is in yellow on the back of his win in the first stage, Peter Sagan has now gone into the lead on points classification. Should he win the green jersey this year, it will be his seventh. Intermediate Sprint result 1. Paul Ourselin: 20 points 2. Yoann Offredo: 17 3. St\u00e9phane Rossetto: 15 4. Anthony Delaplace: 13 5. Tim Wellens: 11 6. Elia Viviani: 10 7. Peter Sagan: 9 8. Sonny Colbrelli: 8 9. Michael Matthews: 7 10. Andrea Pasqualon: 6 11. Michael Morkov: 5 12. Daniel Oss: 4 13. Giacomo Nizzolo: 3 14. Tony Martin: 2 15. Kasper Asgreen: 1 108km to go: Elia Viviani of Quick Step is first of the bunch over the line at Dizy-Le-Gros, followed by Peter Sagan, who has already got his mitts on the green jersey in this Tour. Things are likely to calm down for the foreseeable future as it\u2019s a fair old schlepp to the first climb. The peloton is strung out and it\u2019s very windy. 113km to go: Tim Wellens (Lotto-Soudal), Anthony Delaplace (Arkea-Samsic), Yoann Offredo (Wanty-Groupe Gobert), Paul Ourselin (Total Direct Energie) and Stephane Rossetto (Cofidis) pedal towards the intermediate sprint, with the peloton 4min 16sec behind them. Race leader Mike Teunissen is towards the front of the bunch, about six riders from the front. The five riders in front don\u2019t make too much of an effort to win the intermediate sprint at Dizy-le-Gros. Paul Ourselin makes more of one than his four colleagues and takes maximum points. 115km to go: On the road providing punditry for Eurosport from the back of a motorbike, my former Sunday morning Talksport co-presenter (a long story for a quieter day!) Bradley Wiggins says the peloton is pretty relaxed at the moment, but things are starting to hot up a bit as they snake along the road. Ablutions have been attended to, snacks have been devoured and the riders are starting to think about getting in position as they prepare for today\u2019s intermediate sprint, which is due in about five minutes. It\u2019s also quite windy, so the very real threat of crosswinds has to be considered. 124km to go: There\u2019s been a change at the front of the bunch, where Tony Martin has decided he\u2019s done enough work for the time being and has dropped back a bit. Assorted Deceuninck-Quick Step riders are doing all the work, presuming with a view to trying to get their man Julian Alaphilippe, one of the favourites for today\u2019s stage, into the yellow jersey. Name the breakaway: \u201cThe idea of a darker Flandrian interpretation of Enid Blyton\u2019s Famous Five series was always flawed,\u201d writes Paul Griffin. \u201cBut once \u2018lashings of ginger beer\u2019 was mistranslated as \u2018constant infusion of Flanders\u2019 39% Black Damnation stout,\u2019 the cast plumbed unprintably sordid depths of depravity. To this day Wellens, Delaplace, Offredo and Ourselin are unwelcome in the film industry, anywhere in the world, while Rossetto the dog is anxious around liquids, trees, people, clouds and desks.\u201d 128km to go: The gap from the five-man breakaway to the the group is 5min 19sec with a little over 85 kilometres behind them. 130km to go: My first email of this year\u2019s Tour and it\u2019s a complaint, albeit a passive aggressive one. \u201cJust seen that you are resorting to GCN to fill quiet times in the Tour de France live feed,\u201d writes Cathy. \u201cPerhaps you could cover the biggest race in the women\u2019s calendar during the quiet times, given the Guardian is currently ignoring its existence? Currently we have a breakaway at 3\u201936 from the peloton, giving the virtual race lead to talented young rider Nadia Quagliotto.\u201d The race to which Cathy is alluding is the Giro Rosa, the women\u2019s version of the Giro d\u2019Italia. It boasted one of the best finishes to a bike race you\u2019ll see in yesterday\u2019s Stage Three, when Marianne Vos of the Netherlands swooped to conquer Lucy Kennedy, who made the fatal error of sitting up in her saddle a milli-second too early when she thought victory was already hers. 144km to go: Tony Martin continues to lead the bunch, trying to control the gap to the five-man breakaway. The gap is 5min 38sec at the moment. The hills at the business end of today\u2019s stage, which ends with a punchy climb, means it won\u2019t end in a traditional sprint finish, which explains the reluctance of the rest of the bunch to do any work. Global Cycling Network The GCN is a veritable treasure trove of hot cycling content for those of us with long live blogs to update when not a great deal is going on. In the accompanying video, they assess the runners and riders in this year\u2019s Tour and try to find their idea of winner. 150km to go: Now the lads at the front take some grub on board, taking snacks from their team cars as they roll along led by Tim Wellens, who has a big banana sticking out of his jersey pocket in a manner that probably isn\u2019t particularly aerodynamic. The gap is 5min 27sec. 156km to go: It\u2019s more or less as you were, with Tim Wellens (Lotto-Soudal), Anthony Delaplace (Arkea-Samsic), Yoann Offredo (Wanty-Groupe Gobert), Paul Ourselin (Total Direct Energie) and Stephane Rossetto (Cofidis) in a breakaway that is now 5min 29sec clear of the punch. Team Jumbo-Visma\u2019s Tony Martin is doing all the donkey work at the front of the bunch, where assorted cyclists are attending to the call of nature, or dropping back to their team cars for refreshments. Mitchelton Scott Tour diary ... The Australian team of Adam Yates, tend to give Tour video diary. Here\u2019s their piping hot take on yesterday\u2019s TTT. It didn\u2019t go quite as well as they had hoped. 167km to go: The 106th Tour de France left Belgium and entered France and as predicted in Will Fotheringham\u2019s preview, a breakaway group of five riders has gone clear of the bunch. Tim Wellens (Lotto-Soudal), Anthony Delaplace (Arkea-Samsic), Yoann Offredo (Wanty-Groupe Gobert), Paul Ourselin (Total Direct Energie) and Stephane Rossetto (Cofidis) are in the escape party and the gap to the chasing posse is 4min 12sec. The top 10 on General Classification Following his surprise win in the opening stage, Mike Teunissen stays i n yellow following Jumbo-Visma\u2019s win in yesterday\u2019s team time-trial. Here\u2019s how Jeremy Whittle saw the action unfold. From Will Fotheringham\u2019s stage-by-stage report: On the map, a long flattish stage heading south, with a routine bunch sprint, but there is a sting in the tail. It will be dead quiet as far as Reims, with an early break establishing itself, but the final 30km include three stiff third category climbs one after the other, with very little respite, before a final 500m at 8% to the finish. All of France will look to Julian Alaphilippe on a finish made for the world No 1 but all the favourites\u2019 nerves will be on edge with an intense battle for position. A classic day when at least one will lose the Tour.",

      "body": "<p>We expect married couples to live together, once they have vowed to love one another \u201ctill death do us part\u201d. Yet long-distance relationships are on the rise. In the US, <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2017/demo/families/cps-2017.html?mod=article_inline\" title=\"\">the 2017 census</a> found there had been a 44% increase in married couples living apart since 2000, bringing the total to almost 4 million people. So how do these marriages work, especially given that many involve months spent in different time zones? </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a choice of who I fall in love with. She\u2019s the perfect person; it just happens that she lives thousands of miles away,\u201d says theatre director Jordan Murphy, 27, about his New York-based wife, dancer Mariel Latourneau. The pair met in 2015 while working on a production of the musical Honk! in upstate New York and, despite both being in other relationships, kept in touch when Murphy returned to the UK. \u201cI fell in love with her very quickly,\u201d says Murphy. Within three months of returning to London, he had broken up with his partner, flown out to spend Christmas with Latourneau, and they had decided to be together.</p> <p>There then began the expensive back-and-forth of weeks spent in New York or London and then a proposal and marriage in December 2017. The couple are currently applying for a visa that will enable Latourneau<strong> </strong>to move to London, as their four years apart have taken their toll. \u201cWe end up texting while the other person is asleep,\u201d Murphy says, \u201cso it feels weird always having that lag of response times. And if we\u2019re both in rehearsals, we pretty much don\u2019t speak at all, which is really hard \u2013 we\u2019ve had disagreements just because the other person isn\u2019t around to vent to.\u201d Yet the couple have found ways to be creative with the time that they do have together, flying out for surprise visits, like Murphy\u2019s trip to New York on their first wedding anniversary, or sending care packages. \u201cWhen we first started going out, I sent Mariel a package of classic British sweets, which of course had all melted by the time they got to her,\u201d Murphy says.</p> <p>The visa process is a long one, requiring WhatsApp logs and photo evidence to prove their relationship, as well as financial records and proof of their proposed marital residence, but Murphy is hopeful that within the next year they will be successful. \u201cThe hardest thing is saying goodbye and not knowing when we\u2019ll see each other next,\u201d he says. \u201cI hope we can finally be together soon \u2013 Mariel is the most supportive person I\u2019ve ever met and, without her, this wouldn\u2019t survive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have to ask the question of who is benefiting most from the long-distance relationship,\u201d couples therapist Elle Sidel says. \u201cThere are people who are more comfortable without having too much contact and they might end up putting their needs before others. Since communication time is limited when you\u2019re not living together, you might avoid having difficult conversations about what\u2019s been troubling you.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2479772a44d0e21604008d77545cd719e993ccd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2479772a44d0e21604008d77545cd719e993ccd7/0_86_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roo Yeshpaul Johnson with her husband Tyler Johnson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roo Yeshpaul Johnson with her husband Tyler Johnson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adri Page Photography</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Roo Yeshpaul Johnson, 32, was clear from the outset of her five-year marriage to military engineer Tyler that her needs were as important as his. \u201cTy gets deployed for two to three months all the time and last year he was gone for seven, which was the longest we\u2019ve ever spent apart,\u201d she says, \u201cbut he only has nine years left before retirement and he knows that when that time comes, I\u2019m putting my career first \u2013 I\u2019ll be in the driving seat.\u201d</p> <p>For now, though, it is transitioning from time apart to time together that can be the most challenging, especially since Johnson is eight months pregnant. \u201cWhen he\u2019s been gone a long time, you can start to get ambivalent about talking to each other,\u201d she says, \u201cand it can feel like you have to get used to being with that person all over again when they\u2019re back. I\u2019m not sure I agree with the idea that absence makes the heart grow fonder. But when the baby comes that will all change, there will be more structure.\u201d</p> <p>Loneliness is another issue. Johnson says that other friendships can get stronger when Tyler is away, since, \u201cwhen I\u2019m alone, I might throw myself into seeing people every night, not wanting to come back to an empty house\u201d. But she also often isolates herself, because \u201cthe only person you want to be around isn\u2019t there\u201d.</p> <p>Samarpita Sharma, 38, an editor, similarly finds isolation the most difficult part of her marriage, even though her husband, Sankalp, lives only a two-hour drive from her home in Bhopal, India. \u201cHe\u2019s not that far away, but keeps very long hours working on his family\u2019s farm,\u201d she says. \u201cSo he\u2019ll be gone for seven to 10 days at a time and then come back for two. In the evenings, when all of our neighbours are eating together, it can get really lonely. Our marriage suffers because of it.\u201d The couple exchange short messages throughout the day \u2013 \u201cWe tell each other: \u2018I love you,\u2019 and that helps us feel connected\u201d \u2013 but it will be \u201cat least five years\u201d before Sankalp can spend more time away from the farm and up to 20 before they retire and live there together.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"309254e9fbc10f66bc9e4a2f5bbbc55f9ca7b05b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/309254e9fbc10f66bc9e4a2f5bbbc55f9ca7b05b/0_9_958_720/500.jpg\" alt=\"Samarpita and Sankalp Sharma\" width=\"500\" height=\"376\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samarpita and Sankalp Sharma.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not all marriages survive separation.

It\u2019s the hottest day of the year so far, and the people fanning themselves with gallery maps have come to join the monthly LGBTQ tour, which Vo, a volunteer, helped set up four years ago. \u201cOn the count of three,\u201d he bellows, \u201cwe\u2019re just going to shout \u2018queer\u2019 \u2013 celebrating Stonewall, remembering how hard we fought to be here.

At the end, everyone goes for a drink.</p> <p>The tour\u2019s burgeoning popularity is part of a more general \u201cqueering\u201d of British museums that is gathering pace. Institutions across the UK are teasing out stories of same-sex desire and gender nonconformity in artefacts that have, until now, been left untold, or actively suppressed. In 2015, National Museums Liverpool launched a research project to identify objects with an LGBTQ connection, <a href=\"http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/collections/lgbt/trail/?item=all&amp;fr=all\">resulting in a trail</a> that takes in four separate venues. Last year, the University of Cambridge began piloting a <a href=\"https://museums.cam.ac.uk/bridgingbinaries\">tour programme</a> that takes in its classical archaeology, zoology and polar museums (gay penguins make an appearance).

And what stories are being told about it? \u201cI think this is a moment of huge change in museums and particularly in collections like [ours],\u201d says head of education Andy McLellan. \u201cWhen people came into the museum 20 years ago, they just went, \u2018Isn\u2019t the Pitt Rivers museum a quaint place! And it\u2019s got these lovely handwritten labels and, oh, they\u2019re a little bit iffy but it\u2019s all about the atmosphere.\u2019 And people are coming into the museum today and they\u2019re saying, \u2018You need to change this. You need to face up to these issues. We want to find out about them \u2013 we don\u2019t want you hiding them.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Part of the response includes finding new ways to interpret the objects already on display, sifting through the vast stores to find hidden gems, and even \u201cethically collecting\u201d new artefacts: the museum is in discussions about acquiring designs by Corey Bulpitt, a First Nations artist from Canada, whose <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/nativenorthwest/photos/we-have-some-respect-posters-available-for-community-spaces-across-canada-the-po/1445306578826657/\">work </a><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/nativenorthwest/photos/we-have-some-respect-posters-available-for-community-spaces-across-canada-the-po/1445306578826657/\">based on the traditional Haida motif</a> of the rainbow has been adopted by LGBTQ activists.

Back at the V&amp;A, the criteria for deciding what features in the tours are more straightforward. \u201cWe have a rule of three for choosing things,\u201d says Vo. \u201cEither the creator is queer, or it could be the object itself depicts a queer subject. The third and most important one is that it\u2019s something the community may have taken on board as part of their story.\u201d The <a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/the-story-of-michelangelos-david\">plaster reproduction</a> of Michelangelo\u2019s David in the museum\u2019s cast room satisfies all of these requirements, by virtue of the homoerotic friendship between biblical figures David and Jonathan, Michelangelo\u2019s reputed homosexuality, and the fact that the statue was used as a discreet come-on by travellers returning from the grand tour. \u201cIf you brought back a statue of David and had it on your shelf, it was usually an invitation, a hint for others to approach you and say, I think there might be things we can talk about.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"045404e29524321814240c4b6a871eb43e8efb05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/045404e29524321814240c4b6a871eb43e8efb05/0_0_3000_1818/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Signal \u2026 a five-metre-high cast of Michelangelo\u2019s David in the V&amp;A\u2019s Cast Court.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"606\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Signal \u2026 a five-metre-high cast of Michelangelo\u2019s David in the V&amp;A\u2019s Cast Court.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Court/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Coded messages appear elsewhere in the museum, albeit in a different form. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of William Mulready and John Linnell,\u201d Vo says, referring to 19th-century painters said to have been lovers. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that their paintings were placed side by side in the museum. Curators in the past left little signs like this for us to pick up.\u201d And then there\u2019s what Vo calls \u201chistorical gaydar\u201d. \u201cYou can look at an object and think there\u2019s something about this that I connect with.

The National Trust\u2019s 2017 <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/features/prejudice-and-pride-exploring-lgbtq-history\">Prejudice and Pride programme</a>, which aimed to show \u201chow the often secretive lives of members of the LGBTQ community have helped shape the places we care for\u201d, was <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/08/04/national-trust-facing-membership-boycott-gay-campaign/\">labelled</a> a \u201cgay campaign\u201d by the Telegraph and said to have provoked an (ultimately illusory) \u201cmembership crisis\u201d.

James Daykin, 44, travelled from Banbury to attend the Pitt Rivers tour. \u201cI think it\u2019s fantastic. It\u2019s the start of something.\u201d Daykin points out that the queering of museums doesn\u2019t serve the needs of just LGBTQ people.

And we didn\u2019t just appear 50 years ago with the intention to wreak havoc on the world, you know?\u201d</p> <p>By the end of the tour at the V&amp;A, a mother and daughter from Edinburgh named Zoe Agnew, 60, and Harriet Phillips, 21, are bubbling over with excitement. \u201cWhen Harriet first came out to me, I wasn\u2019t in a good place at that time, so I wasn\u2019t very accepting of it.\u201d But that has changed to the extent that, as Harriet points out, the V&amp;A visit was entirely her mum\u2019s idea. \u201cI just want to educate myself,\u201d Zoe says.</p> <p>\u201cOnce you start seeing it, you see it everywhere.

      "body": "<p>The most seductive theory in sport has had one hell of a hearing during the past month. As the Women\u2019s World Cup captured more hearts and minds, so the assumption intensified that England\u2019s run will be a gamechanger, with elite success encouraging large numbers \u2013 particularly girls \u2013 to play football and get active. It sounds logical enough. Lucy Bronze, Megan Rapinoe, Wendie Renard and Rose Lavelle are fantastic role models, after all. There\u2019s just one problem. There isn\u2019t much evidence for what academics have called the \u201crole\u2011modelling\u201d or \u201ctrickle-down\u201d effect.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/06/english-womens-football-seeks-legacy-from-france-2019-but-frailties-remain\">English women's football seeks legacy from France 2019 but frailties remain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Remember when Boris Becker, Steffi Graf and Michael Stich brought an unprecedented number of grand-slam victories for German tennis? There was a decline in membership of the German Tennis Association afterwards. Similarly, in the run up to London 2012 people such as Colin Moynihan, then chair of the British Olympic Association, promised a home Games would \u201cmotivate a whole generation of young people as they seek to emulate their Team GB heroes\u201d. The reality has been less rosy. A recent Sport England survey found one in three children do less than 30 minutes of activity a day \u2013 such as walking, using a scooter, or playing sport \u2013 with the sports minister, Mims Davies, calling it \u201csimply unacceptable\u201d.</p> <p>We should not be surprised. Long before 2012 researchers looked at Australia\u2019s Olympic results between 1976 and 1996, and identified no correlation between national sporting achievements and \u201csedentariness\u201d rates in the population. Meanwhile a systematic review of public health initiatives after the 2000 Sydney Olympics suggested there was no evidence that the euphoria of the Games turned into increased activity, despite the silky rhetoric and promises.</p> <p>Other research has found a slight negative correlation between Olympic success and mass sports participation. <a href=\"https://daneshyari.com/article/preview/140904.pdf\" title=\"\">As the authors of another study put it</a>: \u201cIt is a well\u2011known assumption that the success of professional athletes increases sport participation in their home country.

      "bodyText": "The most seductive theory in sport has had one hell of a hearing during the past month. As the Women\u2019s World Cup captured more hearts and minds, so the assumption intensified that England\u2019s run will be a gamechanger, with elite success encouraging large numbers \u2013 particularly girls \u2013 to play football and get active. It sounds logical enough. Lucy Bronze, Megan Rapinoe, Wendie Renard and Rose Lavelle are fantastic role models, after all. There\u2019s just one problem. There isn\u2019t much evidence for what academics have called the \u201crole\u2011modelling\u201d or \u201ctrickle-down\u201d effect. Remember when Boris Becker, Steffi Graf and Michael Stich brought an unprecedented number of grand-slam victories for German tennis? There was a decline in membership of the German Tennis Association afterwards. Similarly, in the run up to London 2012 people such as Colin Moynihan, then chair of the British Olympic Association, promised a home Games would \u201cmotivate a whole generation of young people as they seek to emulate their Team GB heroes\u201d. The reality has been less rosy. A recent Sport England survey found one in three children do less than 30 minutes of activity a day \u2013 such as walking, using a scooter, or playing sport \u2013 with the sports minister, Mims Davies, calling it \u201csimply unacceptable\u201d. We should not be surprised. Long before 2012 researchers looked at Australia\u2019s Olympic results between 1976 and 1996, and identified no correlation between national sporting achievements and \u201csedentariness\u201d rates in the population. Meanwhile a systematic review of public health initiatives after the 2000 Sydney Olympics suggested there was no evidence that the euphoria of the Games turned into increased activity, despite the silky rhetoric and promises. Other research has found a slight negative correlation between Olympic success and mass sports participation. As the authors of another study put it: \u201cIt is a well\u2011known assumption that the success of professional athletes increases sport participation in their home country. However, the theoretical support for such a relationship, as well as the empirical evidence, is shallow.\u201d Read that again. Let it marinate. Across the globe, politicians and public authorities partly justify investment in elite sport based on the effect it has on the ordinary population. But the evidence that such trickle\u2011down effects in sport work is as elusive as trickle\u2011down economics was in Ronald Reagan\u2019s America. Of course some of us are inspired to take up a sport after watching it on TV but studies suggest much of this comes from a \u201csubstitution effect\u201d, with already active people switching from one sport to another, or from encouraging lapsed players to dig out their racket or golf clubs again during Wimbledon or the Open. The challenge is getting more people to become more active more of the time. What about women\u2019s football? Clearly it is growing in popularity, so it can be tricky to disentangle increasing participation with the success of a national team. However a study looking at the after\u2011effects of Japan\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup victory in 2011 does just that. The academic Hideaki Ishigami examined all extracurricular activities recorded by 1.5m female Japanese students in the years leading up to and after the tournament \u2013 helped by the fact the Nippon Junior High School Physical Culture Association, a national governing body, compiles registration data for 99% of schools in Japan by type of sport. As Ishigami noted, more girls played football in Japan after 2011. But there was a blunt kicker: his research also found it was \u201cno greater than expected by chance\u201d once growing participation levels before the 2011 tournament were taken into account. As he put it: \u201cWe found no quantitative evidence supporting the role-modelling effect. This implies the increase in their participation following the 2011 World Cup would have been observed regardless of whether Japan won.\u201d As Ishigami notes, gender is clearly a factor. The Daichi Life Insurance Company has conducted annual surveys with 13-year-olds in Japan since 1989. According to their findings, girls\u2019 dream jobs have consistently included teaching, the medical profession and catering \u2013 with sports never ranking in the list, even after the 2011 World Cup.

The fact that we see this in another animal suggests that if you have a brain with certain cognitive and neural capacities, you are predisposed to dance,\u201d he added.</p> \n<p>It all started, as some things must, with the Backstreet Boys.

      "bodyText": "When Snowball the sulphur-crested cockatoo revealed his first dance moves a decade ago he became an instant sensation. The foot-tapping, head-bobbing bird boogied his way on to TV talkshows and commercials and won an impressive internet audience. But that was merely the start. A new study of the prancing parrot points to a bird at the peak of his creative powers. In performances conducted from the back of an armchair, Snowball pulled 14 distinct moves \u2013 a repertoire that would put many humans to shame. Footage of Snowball in action shows him smashing Another One Bites the Dust by Queen and Cyndi Lauper\u2019s Girls Just Wanna Have Fun with a dazzling routine of head-bobs, foot-lifts, body-rolls, poses and headbanging. In one move, named the Vogue, Snowball moves his head from one side of a lifted foot to another. \u201cWe were amazed,\u201d said Aniruddh Patel, a psychology professor at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts. \u201cThere are moves in there, like the Madonna Vogue move, that I just can\u2019t believe.\u201d \u201cIt seems that dancing to music isn\u2019t purely a product of human culture. The fact that we see this in another animal suggests that if you have a brain with certain cognitive and neural capacities, you are predisposed to dance,\u201d he added. It all started, as some things must, with the Backstreet Boys. In 2008, Patel, who has long studied the origins of musicality, watched a video on the internet of Snowball dancing in time to the band\u2019s track Everybody. He contacted Irena Schulz, who owned the bird shelter where Snowball lived, and with her soon launched a study of Snowball\u2019s dancing prowess.

As Mitsotakis\u2019 only son, Kyriakos seemed destined to go into politics too. After being educated at Greece\u2019s elite Athens College, he was sent to Harvard University where he graduated with a degree in social studies in 1990.</p>\n    <p>But after continuing his studies \u2013 earning an MA in international relations at Standford University and an MBA from Harvard's Business School - he took a different path. He went to London to work as a financial analyst with Chase Investment Bank, and then as a consultant with the business company McKinsey. It wasn\u2019t until 2004, seven years after returning to Greece to continue his financial career, that he ventured into politics and ran for parliament.</p>\n    <p>Like his father, Mitsotakis saw himself as a liberal centrist who cared about green issues and human rights. From 2013 to 2015 he served as minister for administrative reform in the coalition government headed by Antonis Samaras. During his tenure thousands of civil servants were laid off, igniting fierce criticism from political opponents.</p>\n    <p>In January 2016, when the New Democracy party had been riven by Greece\u2019s economic crisis, he decided to run for the leadership, but had little support and soon discovered his name was more of a hindrance than a help. He eventually won the post, but only after running what aides describe as a tough campaign. Once he assumed the leadership, his overhaul of New Democracy began, culminating with the party returning to power in 2019.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>From the outset, there was no escaping the change in style.

They will then go on display in Kabul. Seeking to highlight work the British Museum does that often goes under the radar, its director, Hartwig Fischer, said \u201cwar, conflict, climate change, globalisation, poverty and migration\u201d all played a part in threats to cultural heritage. \u201cI am extremely proud of this deep and committed engagement, built collaboratively over many years \u2026 Sadly, this work is more essential now than ever and the museum will continue and increase its efforts to assist colleagues globally in the preservation and celebration of their cultural heritage.\u201d London has long been the centre of a thriving black market in illegally traded ancient artefacts. The museum also revealed details of a group of 154 Mesopotamian texts written on small clay tablets that were seized on entry to the UK in February 2011. After investigations they will soon be returned to Iraq. The work the museum does to facilitate the return of recently looted objects will inevitably raise questions of why it resists the repatriation of items in its collection that have been historically looted. Some of the best known examples include the Benin bronzes, which were taken from what is now Nigeria by British forces in the late 19th century. A new museum is planned in Benin City and Fischer said the British Museum had been involved in talks about collaboration and loans as part of a consortium called the Benin dialogue group. \u201cWhat we have managed to do over the past year is to establish a much closer dialogue, exchange, collaboration, confidence, trust with our colleagues, especially in Benin City but also Lagos,\u201d he said. The museum\u2019s 2018-19 annual review revealed on Monday that it received 6.02 million visitors in the year to April. That means that while Tate Modern was the most visited attraction in 2018, the museum was number one in the financial year. Fischer addressed another contentious issue the museum faces: its continuing sponsorship by BP. Dropping the oil company would not be a meaningful contribution to the world\u2019s environmental challenges, he argued. \u201cIt\u2019s looking to the ways we live and consume that will make a difference. Ending a partnership which over the years has created extraordinary learning opportunities, for people from all walks of life, is not a vital contribution to solving the environmental challenges and problems in the world,\u201d Fischer said.",

In August last year his country finally exited the massive \u20ac86bn (\u00a377bn) EU bailout programme and the economy is expected to grow by 2.2% this year.</p> <p>The recent striking of a deal under which the Greek government agreed to end a 28-year-old dispute and drop its opposition to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia joining the EU and Nato in return for the country changing its name to North Macedonia has added to the embrace of Tspiras as a man with whom Brussels can do business.</p> <p>\u201cWe are a party that belongs to the European family of the governing left,\u201d Tspiras told the Economist recently. \u201cAnd if you govern, you have to make compromises.\u201d</p> <p>But while he is now glad-handed and lauded by the likes of the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, who once counselled the Greek people not to listen to their young leader, back at home the ideological flexibility appears to have fallen flat with the voters.</p> <p>Tspiras was banking on some hefty pre-election handouts, with a heavy fiscal cost of 1% of gross domestic product for both 2019 and 2020, sweetening the pill of the last few years. But unemployment in Greece remains high at 18%, and there has been widespread disappointment at the failure to deliver on promises to restore welfare spending to pre-crisis levels and increase pensions.</p> <p>Mitsotakis, a former banker, goes into power having promised to cut taxes, lift living standards, reform the state and tackle clientelism, a problem that has dogged his party in the past.</p> <p>\u201cA lot has been achieved,\u201d the commission president wrote to the new prime minister in his letter of congratulations. \u201cBut a lot remains to be done.\u201d Tsipras has said he plans to be active in politics for another 20 years.

      "bodyText": "For Brussels and Berlin, it may as well have been Moros, the Greek god of impending doom, a driver of mortals to their deadly fate, who had been elected as the prime minister of Greece in January 2015. Alexis Tsipras was the radical leftwing firebrand with the open-necked shirt, whose Syriza government posed a threat to the European order through its demands to rewrite the rules underpinning the single currency, and willingness to take Greece and the EU to the brink to achieve that goal. The open-necked shirt was still there at a summit of EU leaders last week but rather than being spat out as a profanity by irate German bean-counters, Tsipras\u2019s name was being circulated, perhaps a tad unconvincingly, as an outside contender for a top EU job. The 44-year-old has been on quite a journey. Unfortunately for him, he doesn\u2019t seem to have taken the Greek people with him this time. The thumping win for Kyriakos Mitsotakis\u2019s New Democracy party with 39.8% of the vote, giving him 158 seats in the 300-member parliament, highlights a divergence in perception between Brussels and Athens that goes some way to explaining many of the problems facing the EU. Since Tsipras\u2019s extraordinary volte-face in late 2015, facing down his finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, to accept arduous EU bailout terms despite having won a mandate through a referendum to reject them, the Greek prime minister has emerged to many in Brussels, to paraphrase Margaret Thatcher, as \u201cone of us\u201d. Tspiras fully implemented the last phase of the austerity programme. In August last year his country finally exited the massive \u20ac86bn (\u00a377bn) EU bailout programme and the economy is expected to grow by 2.2% this year. The recent striking of a deal under which the Greek government agreed to end a 28-year-old dispute and drop its opposition to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia joining the EU and Nato in return for the country changing its name to North Macedonia has added to the embrace of Tspiras as a man with whom Brussels can do business. \u201cWe are a party that belongs to the European family of the governing left,\u201d Tspiras told the Economist recently. \u201cAnd if you govern, you have to make compromises.\u201d But while he is now glad-handed and lauded by the likes of the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, who once counselled the Greek people not to listen to their young leader, back at home the ideological flexibility appears to have fallen flat with the voters. Tspiras was banking on some hefty pre-election handouts, with a heavy fiscal cost of 1% of gross domestic product for both 2019 and 2020, sweetening the pill of the last few years. But unemployment in Greece remains high at 18%, and there has been widespread disappointment at the failure to deliver on promises to restore welfare spending to pre-crisis levels and increase pensions. Mitsotakis, a former banker, goes into power having promised to cut taxes, lift living standards, reform the state and tackle clientelism, a problem that has dogged his party in the past. \u201cA lot has been achieved,\u201d the commission president wrote to the new prime minister in his letter of congratulations. \u201cBut a lot remains to be done.\u201d Tsipras has said he plans to be active in politics for another 20 years. There is little doubt he has the capacity to reinvent himself should Mitsotakis falter.",

      "body": "<p>Brazil winning a Copa Am\u00e9rica at home cannot be said to be a surprise. They have hosted the tournament five times and, after beating Peru 3-1 in the final on Sunday, they have won it five times. But to suggest this was some sort of procession, a pacing out of the inevitable, would be misleading, and would ignore why, 12 years after Brazil\u2019s last success in a major competition, this felt so significant.</p> <p>It is not just that this showed Brazil could handle being favourites, that they did not choke on the expectation as they did so spectacularly in the World Cup five years ago. It\u2019s that they won with a largely modern, progressive style of play and, most importantly of all, that they did so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/05/neymar-industrial-complex-barney-ronay\" title=\"\">without the injured Neymar</a>. This was a victory for Tite and all for which he stands.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/07/copa-america-brazil-peru-final-gabriel-jesus\">Brazil end Copa Am\u00e9rica drought with victory over Peru in final</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Brazil\u2019s defeat against Peru in Foxborough three years ago, which eliminated them from the Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario at the group stage, was the beginning of Brazil\u2019s belated shift into modernity. Out went Dunga and in came Tite, who had none of his predecessor\u2019s insularity. He studied others, went to Europe to learn, and adopted a form of pressing.</p> <p>And yet the sense at the World Cup was always that he was hampered by Neymar, a galactic ego who could not be relied on to press and slowed the game down. There were moments in Russia, notably against Mexico in the last 16, when Brazil showed what they could be but the Neymar imbalance did for them against Belgium as Thomas Meunier\u2019s unchecked sallies on the right placed an intolerable pressure on Philippe Coutinho, who was probably being asked to perform a role more defensive than he was comfortable in anyway.</p> <p>Without Neymar in this tournament, Brazil became fully Tite-ist. It took a bout of mumps for Richarlison and a misfiring performance from David Neres for him to happen on his front three but once it came together it knitted together superbly, with Everton and Gabriel Jesus cutting in from the flanks and Roberto Firmino dropping deep from a central position. Against Peru, Gabriel Jesus set up the opener for Everton, whose run also led to the late penalty while the second, scored by Gabriel Jesus, came from Firmino winning the ball deep and a forward surge from Arthur.</p> <p>The Barcelona midfielder had a vital role shuttling between Casemiro at the back of midfield and Coutinho as a playmaker and was probably the sort of player Brazil really missed at the World Cup \u2013 although before criticising Paulinho, the man Arthur replaced, too strongly it should probably be noted his role was made easier by the way Coutinho was allowed to play more centrally because he was not always covering for a vacant left flank.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/jul/06/copa-america-final-brazil-peru-live\">Brazil 3-1 Peru: Copa Am\u00e9rica 2019 final \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tite\u2019s mastery was confirmed after Gabriel Jesus\u2019s 70th-minute red card.

      "bodyText": "Brazil winning a Copa Am\u00e9rica at home cannot be said to be a surprise. They have hosted the tournament five times and, after beating Peru 3-1 in the final on Sunday, they have won it five times. But to suggest this was some sort of procession, a pacing out of the inevitable, would be misleading, and would ignore why, 12 years after Brazil\u2019s last success in a major competition, this felt so significant. It is not just that this showed Brazil could handle being favourites, that they did not choke on the expectation as they did so spectacularly in the World Cup five years ago. It\u2019s that they won with a largely modern, progressive style of play and, most importantly of all, that they did so without the injured Neymar. This was a victory for Tite and all for which he stands. Brazil\u2019s defeat against Peru in Foxborough three years ago, which eliminated them from the Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario at the group stage, was the beginning of Brazil\u2019s belated shift into modernity. Out went Dunga and in came Tite, who had none of his predecessor\u2019s insularity. He studied others, went to Europe to learn, and adopted a form of pressing. And yet the sense at the World Cup was always that he was hampered by Neymar, a galactic ego who could not be relied on to press and slowed the game down. There were moments in Russia, notably against Mexico in the last 16, when Brazil showed what they could be but the Neymar imbalance did for them against Belgium as Thomas Meunier\u2019s unchecked sallies on the right placed an intolerable pressure on Philippe Coutinho, who was probably being asked to perform a role more defensive than he was comfortable in anyway. Without Neymar in this tournament, Brazil became fully Tite-ist. It took a bout of mumps for Richarlison and a misfiring performance from David Neres for him to happen on his front three but once it came together it knitted together superbly, with Everton and Gabriel Jesus cutting in from the flanks and Roberto Firmino dropping deep from a central position. Against Peru, Gabriel Jesus set up the opener for Everton, whose run also led to the late penalty while the second, scored by Gabriel Jesus, came from Firmino winning the ball deep and a forward surge from Arthur. The Barcelona midfielder had a vital role shuttling between Casemiro at the back of midfield and Coutinho as a playmaker and was probably the sort of player Brazil really missed at the World Cup \u2013 although before criticising Paulinho, the man Arthur replaced, too strongly it should probably be noted his role was made easier by the way Coutinho was allowed to play more centrally because he was not always covering for a vacant left flank. Tite\u2019s mastery was confirmed after Gabriel Jesus\u2019s 70th-minute red card. Briefly it seemed that Peru, who had been starting to threaten anyway, might be able to mount telling pressure but he acted decisively, taking off Firmino for Richarlison who held the ball up superbly and, with Dani Alves pushing into midfield after \u00c9der Milit\u00e3o came on for Coutinho, the shift in momentum was checked. At the World Cup, Tite often seemed the calmest man in the Brazil camp and here he was again, decisive and rational. The result was a Brazil who seemed smarter and more ruthless, less hysterical and less jingoistic. Perhaps not unrelated, the victory was not the propaganda triumph for the president, Jair Bolsonaro, that might have been expected. High ticket prices meant the crowd was widely assumed to be made up of the idle classes who make up the bulk of his support and there has been a growing association between the yellow national team shirt and his far-right movement. But whenBolsonaro stepped on to the pitch for the trophy presentation, he was greeted with widespread booing. Even more telling, when the squad paraded along the line of dignitaries to collect their medals, Marquinhos ignored him entirely, Coutinho visibly squirmed in his presence and Tite skilfully fended off his attempt at a hug. Brazil were not perfect, by any means. They struggled to break down Venezuela and Paraguay. They were perhaps overly conservative against Argentina in the semi-final when refereeing decisions went their way. But Brazil conceded only one goal in six games and looked as coherent as a unit as they have for years \u2013 probably since even before the 2007 Copa Am\u00e9rica when they were wildly inconsistent. Tite\u2019s position, though, is far from certain. He is frustrated that various members of his coaching staff, among them the former Arsenal players Sylvinho and Edu, have been allowed to leave. Last week the Brazilian federation, the CBF, issued a statement insisting that were he to go it would be of his own volition.

      "body": "<p>Welcome to this week\u2019s blogpost. Here\u2019s our roundup of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/jun/17/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/jul/01/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week\">your comments and photos </a>from last week.</p> <p>Give yourselves a pat on the back, readers. Old Filth by Jane Gardam has delighted <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4813196\">safereturndoubtful </a>\u2013 and it\u2019s thanks to Tips, links and suggestions:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I would never have read something like this if it wasn\u2019t for this group, so much gratitude to those reviewers. Although the story doesn\u2019t always grip, Gardam\u2019s characters do, several remarkably independent souls, living in their own worlds, wonderfully drawn and presented. Often there is a sketchy presentation, lots left unsaid, an invitation for the reader to fill the voids; this aspect being one of the most appealing in her writing, and yet at the same time the most frustrating, is there another story, just as rich but withheld, in the gaps between the passages. Always there is a good balance of melancholy and humour, and the most memorable sentences were about Filth\u2019s old age, making recall William Boyd\u2019s two great books, Another Human Heart and The New Confessions .</p> </blockquote> <p>Rachel Cusk\u2019s The Last Supper: A Summer in Italy is a summer recommendation from <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/17556458\">SeriousSoul1965</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Cusk shares with readers a variety of intriguing experiences from her family\u2019s three-month trip to Italy. This is a lovely work that is filled with gorgeous prose and imagery as well as reflections on art, family life, and her family\u2019s interactions with fellow travellers. The author meditates on her desire/need to see new vistas and pursue new experiences while escaping life\u2019s all-too-familiar routines. This is a quiet, lyrical book and perfect for leisurely summer reading.</p> </blockquote> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been having a tear through Patrick deWitt\u2019s novels,\u201d says <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/15134444\">katcalls</a>. First up, French Exit:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This book was pretty much what I needed, funny, acerbic, great characters and just an all-round rollicking and assured effort. This was my first deWitt novel and it was a great entry.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/2238842\">FrogC </a>has just finished VS Naipaul\u2019s A House for Mr Biswas:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It really is one of the great novels of its age, up there with <em>The Tin Drum</em> and <em>One Hundred Years of Solitude</em>, but without the magic, just realism. In fact, it seems a simple trick that almost any writer could do, a third-person, past-tense novel rooted in autobiography. But it is immensely detailed, on a huge scale, an exhaustive account of ordinariness, and one that is beautifully written and full of life and humour.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sebastian Barry\u2019s Days Without End has blown away <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/748720\">JayZed</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Oh wow, this really blew me away.

      "bodyText": "Welcome to this week\u2019s blogpost. Here\u2019s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week. Give yourselves a pat on the back, readers. Old Filth by Jane Gardam has delighted safereturndoubtful \u2013 and it\u2019s thanks to Tips, links and suggestions: I would never have read something like this if it wasn\u2019t for this group, so much gratitude to those reviewers. Although the story doesn\u2019t always grip, Gardam\u2019s characters do, several remarkably independent souls, living in their own worlds, wonderfully drawn and presented. Often there is a sketchy presentation, lots left unsaid, an invitation for the reader to fill the voids; this aspect being one of the most appealing in her writing, and yet at the same time the most frustrating, is there another story, just as rich but withheld, in the gaps between the passages. Always there is a good balance of melancholy and humour, and the most memorable sentences were about Filth\u2019s old age, making recall William Boyd\u2019s two great books, Another Human Heart and The New Confessions . Rachel Cusk\u2019s The Last Supper: A Summer in Italy is a summer recommendation from SeriousSoul1965: Cusk shares with readers a variety of intriguing experiences from her family\u2019s three-month trip to Italy. This is a lovely work that is filled with gorgeous prose and imagery as well as reflections on art, family life, and her family\u2019s interactions with fellow travellers. The author meditates on her desire/need to see new vistas and pursue new experiences while escaping life\u2019s all-too-familiar routines. This is a quiet, lyrical book and perfect for leisurely summer reading. \u201cI\u2019ve been having a tear through Patrick deWitt\u2019s novels,\u201d says katcalls. First up, French Exit: This book was pretty much what I needed, funny, acerbic, great characters and just an all-round rollicking and assured effort. This was my first deWitt novel and it was a great entry. FrogC has just finished VS Naipaul\u2019s A House for Mr Biswas: It really is one of the great novels of its age, up there with The Tin Drum and One Hundred Years of Solitude, but without the magic, just realism. In fact, it seems a simple trick that almost any writer could do, a third-person, past-tense novel rooted in autobiography. But it is immensely detailed, on a huge scale, an exhaustive account of ordinariness, and one that is beautifully written and full of life and humour. Sebastian Barry\u2019s Days Without End has blown away JayZed: Oh wow, this really blew me away. Civil War-era America is something I\u2019m very interested in anyway, but it was the lyrical beauty and authentic voice of this book that really stood out. I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019ve ever read such good, visceral writing about violence and brutality, and yet despite that it was a very tender and moving book and I came to care greatly about the characters. Absolutely wonderful stuff and I definitely need to read more Barry. A fond hail and farewell to the great Sue Townsend from goodyorkshirelass: Have just listened to the final episode of Adrian Mole, The Prostrate Years. Very moving. God rest Sue Townsend. Finally, since it was US Independence Day last week, dylan37 recommends Walt Whitman: I\u2019m half-American, and on this 4th of July it feels right to celebrate some kind of independence with Walt Whitman. In his beautiful collection Leaves of Grass, he set modern poetry free, lit up the soul electric, and wandered through American beauty. Finding grace and equality in every smiling footstep, Whitman paints the best of ideals; ragged glory in shades of blue and heartbreak. Like that shining city on a hill, his verse remains an impossible and distant dream. \u201cI bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love, If you want me again look for me under your boot-soles\u201d. Lines that send shivers down your spine. Whitman is large. Interesting links about books and reading Enjoy disagreeing with the New York Times list of the 50 best memoirs in the last 50 years. (Some good choices, but, alas and laughably, fails to include Julian Cope\u2019s Head-On.) Claire Lowdon on why we should still read John Updike. \u201cThey are concentration camps,\u201d says Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2013 and James Butler agrees. Kieran Setiya on why Iris Murdoch matters. Brown University has a huge gay pulp fiction archive. \u201cYou might be surprised to learn how many authors on the current best-seller lists have had help \u2014 well, sort of \u2014 from their dogs,\u201d say the New York Times.

I think it is unconscionable that any professional person in either politics or the civil service can behave in this way.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cI will be apologising for the fact that either our civil service, or elements of our political class, have not lived up to the expectations that either we have, or the United States has, about their behaviour, which in this particular case has lapsed in a most extraordinary and unacceptable way.\u201d</p> \n<p>Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary and Tory leadership candidate, said that while he did not agree with all of Darroch\u2019s comments, it was vital that diplomatic staff \u201cfeel that they are able to express those frank views\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ed4d096c-efd5-4539-a137-25b801b7c2b7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oq7ZLm7BjBg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a personal view and there will be many people in this building who don\u2019t agree with that view and indeed I don\u2019t agree with some of the views that we saw in those letters,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the US administration is highly effective and we have the warmest of relationships and a partnership based on standing up for shared values.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hunt said the basis for a successful diplomatic service was \u201cthe free exchange of information and opinions, and the understanding that we\u2019re not always going to agree with each other but we want to know what people around the world are thinking\u201d.</p> \n<p>The leak has led some pro-Brexit politicians to call for Darroch to be sacked. Speaking to the BBC\u2019s Today programme, Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, said the incident showed the need for \u201cmajor civil service reform\u201d and a purge of senior ranks to install officials more sympathetic to Trump and to Brexit.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8aaabfef-1e35-4f1e-ae32-d30374766291\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XGoPDchDtHk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid with our civil service, our Foreign Office, everybody stayed in place, it was obvious to all that these were people who in many ways did not accept the results of those elections,\u201d Farage said, adding the new US ambassador should be \u201ca retired business figure, something like that\u201d.</p> \n<p>Farage said a future government under Boris Johnson, the Tory leadership frontrunner, would be expected to remove the ambassador, adding: \u201cIf you take Boris at his word, people like Kim Darroch simply shouldn\u2019t be around.\u201d</p>",

No 10 is scrambling to find the leaker after two years of memos emerged in the Mail on Sunday, causing Trump to condemn Darroch as someone who \u201chas not served the UK well\u201d. With US-UK relations damaged by the embarrassment, British officials have apologised to the US for the leak but not the content of the memos. \u201cContact has been made with the Trump administration setting out our view that we believe the leak in unacceptable. It is, of course, a matter of regret that this has happened,\u201d May\u2019s spokesman said. He said the Cabinet Office had begun its inquiry into whether a civil servant or politician had released the documents to the pro-Brexit journalist Isabel Oakeshott. May\u2019s spokesman said there was no evidence that a hostile overseas government had hacked the documents and rejected calls for the police to be involved at this stage. Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, who is meeting the president\u2019s daughter, Ivanka Trump, later on Monday in the US, has called for the leaker to be prosecuted. He told the BBC: \u201cThis is such a damaging, potentially damaging, event that I hope the full force of our internal discipline, or even the law, will come down on whoever actually carried out this particular act. \u201cMalicious leaks of this nature are unprofessional. They are unethical. And they are unpatriotic. Because they can actually lead to damage to that relationship which can, therefore, affect our security interests. I think it is unconscionable that any professional person in either politics or the civil service can behave in this way.\u201d He added: \u201cI will be apologising for the fact that either our civil service, or elements of our political class, have not lived up to the expectations that either we have, or the United States has, about their behaviour, which in this particular case has lapsed in a most extraordinary and unacceptable way.\u201d Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary and Tory leadership candidate, said that while he did not agree with all of Darroch\u2019s comments, it was vital that diplomatic staff \u201cfeel that they are able to express those frank views\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a personal view and there will be many people in this building who don\u2019t agree with that view and indeed I don\u2019t agree with some of the views that we saw in those letters,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the US administration is highly effective and we have the warmest of relationships and a partnership based on standing up for shared values.\u201d Hunt said the basis for a successful diplomatic service was \u201cthe free exchange of information and opinions, and the understanding that we\u2019re not always going to agree with each other but we want to know what people around the world are thinking\u201d. The leak has led some pro-Brexit politicians to call for Darroch to be sacked. Speaking to the BBC\u2019s Today programme, Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, said the incident showed the need for \u201cmajor civil service reform\u201d and a purge of senior ranks to install officials more sympathetic to Trump and to Brexit. \u201cI\u2019m afraid with our civil service, our Foreign Office, everybody stayed in place, it was obvious to all that these were people who in many ways did not accept the results of those elections,\u201d Farage said, adding the new US ambassador should be \u201ca retired business figure, something like that\u201d. Farage said a future government under Boris Johnson, the Tory leadership frontrunner, would be expected to remove the ambassador, adding: \u201cIf you take Boris at his word, people like Kim Darroch simply shouldn\u2019t be around.\u201d",

Gambler and employee alike, this will ultimately affect those who can afford to lose the least. \u2022 Owen Rees worked for a UK bookmaker for 12 years and is now a stay-at-home father",

      "body": "<p>For many viewers emerging from the cinema, the first question about Midsommar will undoubtedly be: what the hell just happened? We begin our journey in the relative certainties of the real world \u2013 albeit one soured by bereavement for our heroine Dani (Florence Pugh). Nearly two-and-a-half hours later, reality has been warped to the extent that it makes perfect sense to watch Dani, drugged up and dressed as a Jeff Koons puppy, saying goodbye to her asshole boyfriend as he burns to death inside a disembowelled bear, along with other sacrificial victims, in a giant triangular barn, in the middle of Swedish nowhere, surrounded by her cheery new \u201cfamily\u201d. This is fine!</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/28/horror-director-ari-aster-hereditary-midsommar-terrors\">Midsommar director Ari Aster: 'I often cling to dead things'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More questions arise once a sense of normality has returned. Is it a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/03/midsommar-review-ari-aster-florence-pugh\">horror masterpiece</a> for you, as for many critics? After this and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/01/hereditary-review-horror-toni-collette-brilliant-fear\">Hereditary</a>, does <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/28/horror-director-ari-aster-hereditary-midsommar-terrors\">director Ari Aster</a> deserve to be crowned our new king of horror? Or if not, why not? Either way, as with Hereditary, Midsommar feels like a highly considered piece of storytelling beneath the craziness \u2013 technically precise, meticulously designed, dense with allusions, clues, references and riddles. So let\u2019s see if we can decipher some of them, process our feelings and collectively repair our frayed nerves.</p> <h2>Old-time religion?</h2> <p>The belief system of the happy inhabitants of Ha\u030arga seems to be a mix of northern European paganism, occult tradition, arcane numerology and made-up nonsense. How much of each? Native Swedes will have a better idea when it comes to the local lore. May Queens, maypoles and flower crowns are familiar elements of many real-life midsummer rituals. The runes scattered throughout the movie are also genuine (any translators of Elder Futhark out there?). Even the worse-than-death fate of Simon in the chicken coop is based on legends of a gory Norse practice known as the \u201cblood eagle\u201d. There also seems to be something significant about multiples of nine: the division of human life into four 18-year \u201cseasons\u201d, ending at 72 (that unforgettably gory cliff-jumping \u00c4ttestupa ritual is also a real thing). Note how Dani is celebrating her birthday \u2013 if it\u2019s her 27th, it would place her in the exact centre of the second season, the \u201cmidsummer\u201d of her life. Then there are the nine sacrifices, the nine-day festival, the 90-year cycle. Does it all fit together? Does it matter?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"257307c0ab5db4d6c3d8f034f7098365d072042c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/257307c0ab5db4d6c3d8f034f7098365d072042c/0_0_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Is Ari Aster the new king of horror? ...

Jack Reynor and Florence Pugh in Midsommar.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gabor Kotschy/Allstar/A24</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>What\u2019s it really about?</h2> <p>Even if you\u2019re not into deciphering the puzzles, Midsommar is a powerful study of grief, betrayal, breakups, and more. And, as usual, Florence Pugh is just brilliant as Dani. She\u2019s so adept at registering the emotions of her character, whether they\u2019re just below the surface or breaking out into wailing hysteria. We\u2019re with her every step of the way, and, whatever else it represents, the ending of the film is satisfyingly cathartic for Dani on a personal level. As for her three male companions, they get what they deserve, don\u2019t they? They represent different facets of masculine inadequacy. It\u2019s clear that boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor) is a coward and a selfish asshole from the outset, even if Dani is too fragile to realise it. Horndog Mark (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/25/will-poulter-the-little-stranger-white-straight-middle-class-male\">Will Poulter</a>) thinks he\u2019s in Sweden\u2019s answer to Love Island, and Josh (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/06/william-jackson-harper-on-midsommar-and-the-good-place\">William Jackson Harper</a>) puts morality aside in favour of academic ambition. Do these male characters represent corrupting, toxic masculinity? Or is this a parable of snarky, city-smart, modern rationalism undone by primal rural values? Or are the villagers\u2019 ancient pagan traditions actually far-right beliefs dressed up in folksy costumes? White nationalism, racial purity, eugenics, incest \u2013 something rotten at the heart of western civilisation?</p> <h2>Count the precedents</h2> <p>So many movies feed into Midsommar. It is possibly more instructive to detail differences than similarities between Midsommar and definitive folk horror <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/the-wicker-man\">The Wicker Man</a>. Aster himself compared his film to Albert Brooks\u2019 1981 breakup movie Modern Romance (no, I haven\u2019t seen it either). The Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/05/dont-look-now-review-roeg-horror-julie-christie-donald-sutherland\">likened Midsommar to Nicolas Roeg\u2019s Don\u2019t Look Now</a> in its treatment of grief and presentiment. Then again, is Midsommar essentially the same story as Hereditary? In both movies, a grief-stricken woman with mental health issues finds herself a pawn in the grand scheme of some sinister, ancient clan dedicated to perpetuating itself at all costs. And arrives at a place of calm acceptance. Aster made another intriguing comparison last year when he described Midsommar as a <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2019/03/ari-aster-new-a24-movie-midsommar.html\">\u201cWizard of Oz for perverts\u201d</a>. Is there something in that? Dani would be Dorothy, obviously. Her male companions could well be analogues of the Cowardly Lion, the Scarecrow and the Tin Man. Both stories feature storms, witchcraft and hallucinogenic plants. Dani and co even walk into H\u00e5rga down a path strewn with yellow flowers \u2013 a yellow brick road? Does that make Pelle the wizard? In retrospect, he\u2019s the one pulling the strings, isn\u2019t he?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/03/midsommar-review-ari-aster-florence-pugh\">Midsommar review \u2013 outrageous black-comic carnival of agony | Peter Bradshaw's film of the week</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Is it supposed to be funny?</h2> <p>Some have complained that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/06/midsommar-review-florence-pugh-ari-aster-horror-hereditary\">Midsommar\u2019s horror is undercut by its over-the-top ridiculousness</a>, and therefore it\u2019s not as scary as it is trying to be. Certainly in the cinema I went to, there were moments that had the whole house laughing: the recorder-playing villagers who greet the newcomers; Christian\u2019s utterly bonkers sex scene with the red-haired woman (and friends); pretty much every line Mark says. Should we be laughing? Did Aster intend for Midsommar to be a comedy? And if so, do these moments detract from the horror, or complement it?</p> <h2>Does it really make sense?</h2> <p>How often do the people of H\u00e5rga do this? If this is a ritual that only happens once every 90 years, what are these people doing the rest of the time? Or do they do this every year for Midsommar? In which case, wouldn\u2019t people have noticed quite a few foreign tourists going missing in a remote part of Sweden over the years? What would have happened if Dani hadn\u2019t won the May Queen dance-off? And why did the Londoners Connie and Simon have to die? They didn\u2019t do anything wrong, did they? Maybe we\u2019re not meant to understand. Maybe none of this ever happened, and it was all just Dani\u2019s mushroom trip that began moments after they arrived. Maybe the point of the film is to break down rational thought and make us chase our tails in bewildered theorising. In which case mission accomplished.</p>",

      "bodyText": "For many viewers emerging from the cinema, the first question about Midsommar will undoubtedly be: what the hell just happened? We begin our journey in the relative certainties of the real world \u2013 albeit one soured by bereavement for our heroine Dani (Florence Pugh). Nearly two-and-a-half hours later, reality has been warped to the extent that it makes perfect sense to watch Dani, drugged up and dressed as a Jeff Koons puppy, saying goodbye to her asshole boyfriend as he burns to death inside a disembowelled bear, along with other sacrificial victims, in a giant triangular barn, in the middle of Swedish nowhere, surrounded by her cheery new \u201cfamily\u201d. This is fine! More questions arise once a sense of normality has returned. Is it a horror masterpiece for you, as for many critics? After this and Hereditary, does director Ari Aster deserve to be crowned our new king of horror? Or if not, why not? Either way, as with Hereditary, Midsommar feels like a highly considered piece of storytelling beneath the craziness \u2013 technically precise, meticulously designed, dense with allusions, clues, references and riddles. So let\u2019s see if we can decipher some of them, process our feelings and collectively repair our frayed nerves. Old-time religion? The belief system of the happy inhabitants of Ha\u030arga seems to be a mix of northern European paganism, occult tradition, arcane numerology and made-up nonsense. How much of each? Native Swedes will have a better idea when it comes to the local lore. May Queens, maypoles and flower crowns are familiar elements of many real-life midsummer rituals. The runes scattered throughout the movie are also genuine (any translators of Elder Futhark out there?). Even the worse-than-death fate of Simon in the chicken coop is based on legends of a gory Norse practice known as the \u201cblood eagle\u201d. There also seems to be something significant about multiples of nine: the division of human life into four 18-year \u201cseasons\u201d, ending at 72 (that unforgettably gory cliff-jumping \u00c4ttestupa ritual is also a real thing). Note how Dani is celebrating her birthday \u2013 if it\u2019s her 27th, it would place her in the exact centre of the second season, the \u201cmidsummer\u201d of her life. Then there are the nine sacrifices, the nine-day festival, the 90-year cycle. Does it all fit together? Does it matter? What\u2019s it really about? Even if you\u2019re not into deciphering the puzzles, Midsommar is a powerful study of grief, betrayal, breakups, and more. And, as usual, Florence Pugh is just brilliant as Dani. She\u2019s so adept at registering the emotions of her character, whether they\u2019re just below the surface or breaking out into wailing hysteria. We\u2019re with her every step of the way, and, whatever else it represents, the ending of the film is satisfyingly cathartic for Dani on a personal level. As for her three male companions, they get what they deserve, don\u2019t they? They represent different facets of masculine inadequacy. It\u2019s clear that boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor) is a coward and a selfish asshole from the outset, even if Dani is too fragile to realise it. Horndog Mark (Will Poulter) thinks he\u2019s in Sweden\u2019s answer to Love Island, and Josh (William Jackson Harper) puts morality aside in favour of academic ambition. Do these male characters represent corrupting, toxic masculinity? Or is this a parable of snarky, city-smart, modern rationalism undone by primal rural values? Or are the villagers\u2019 ancient pagan traditions actually far-right beliefs dressed up in folksy costumes? White nationalism, racial purity, eugenics, incest \u2013 something rotten at the heart of western civilisation? Count the precedents So many movies feed into Midsommar. It is possibly more instructive to detail differences than similarities between Midsommar and definitive folk horror The Wicker Man. Aster himself compared his film to Albert Brooks\u2019 1981 breakup movie Modern Romance (no, I haven\u2019t seen it either). The Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw likened Midsommar to Nicolas Roeg\u2019s Don\u2019t Look Now in its treatment of grief and presentiment. Then again, is Midsommar essentially the same story as Hereditary? In both movies, a grief-stricken woman with mental health issues finds herself a pawn in the grand scheme of some sinister, ancient clan dedicated to perpetuating itself at all costs. And arrives at a place of calm acceptance. Aster made another intriguing comparison last year when he described Midsommar as a \u201cWizard of Oz for perverts\u201d. Is there something in that? Dani would be Dorothy, obviously. Her male companions could well be analogues of the Cowardly Lion, the Scarecrow and the Tin Man. Both stories feature storms, witchcraft and hallucinogenic plants. Dani and co even walk into H\u00e5rga down a path strewn with yellow flowers \u2013 a yellow brick road? Does that make Pelle the wizard? In retrospect, he\u2019s the one pulling the strings, isn\u2019t he? Is it supposed to be funny? Some have complained that Midsommar\u2019s horror is undercut by its over-the-top ridiculousness, and therefore it\u2019s not as scary as it is trying to be. Certainly in the cinema I went to, there were moments that had the whole house laughing: the recorder-playing villagers who greet the newcomers; Christian\u2019s utterly bonkers sex scene with the red-haired woman (and friends); pretty much every line Mark says. Should we be laughing? Did Aster intend for Midsommar to be a comedy? And if so, do these moments detract from the horror, or complement it? Does it really make sense? How often do the people of H\u00e5rga do this? If this is a ritual that only happens once every 90 years, what are these people doing the rest of the time? Or do they do this every year for Midsommar? In which case, wouldn\u2019t people have noticed quite a few foreign tourists going missing in a remote part of Sweden over the years? What would have happened if Dani hadn\u2019t won the May Queen dance-off? And why did the Londoners Connie and Simon have to die? They didn\u2019t do anything wrong, did they? Maybe we\u2019re not meant to understand. Maybe none of this ever happened, and it was all just Dani\u2019s mushroom trip that began moments after they arrived. Maybe the point of the film is to break down rational thought and make us chase our tails in bewildered theorising. In which case mission accomplished.",

      "bodyText": "BP\u2019s solar subsidiary is on the hunt for Britain\u2019s shiniest grass to help make the most of new double-sided solar panels that can harness light reflected off the ground. Lightsource BP hopes the \u201cbi-facial\u201d solar panels will boost the amount of renewable energy generated at its solar farms and could make them more economic in gloomier parts of Northern Ireland and Scotland. At a test site outside Belfast the company found that the bifacial panels can increase electricity output by almost 15% \u2013 but this can be much higher if the ground beneath the panel is particularly reflective. Lightsource BP is using the findings from its experiment to work with a seed company in Norfolk to find the \u201cmost reflective\u201d grass type to grow underneath the solar panels. Chris Buckland, the technical director of Lightsource BP, said the team tested the panels for almost a year on \u201clush Northern Irish grass\u201d, which helped to reflect light on to the back-facing panels. The grass helped to produce an extra 14% of electricity, he said. The same panels positioned over white floorboards produced almost 30% more electricity than traditional panels and once the floorboards were removed to reveal dried, brown grass the output plummeted \u201cto low single-digits\u201d, he said. Buckland believes that most customers will want to keep grass beneath their panels, rather than boards or gravel, which would require occasional cleaning. \u201cWe\u2019re working with a seed company in Norfolk to trial test fields of different grass types to find a species of grass with the most solar potential to recommend to our customers,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat will be important is that the grass stays green throughout the year.

We\u2019re not there yet.\u201d Lightsource BP hopes to use the new solar technology advances to install solar projects in less sunny areas because the two-faced panels work particularly well in cooler climates. In a trial, the company is using \u201ctracker panels\u201d that, like sunflowers, tilt through the day to follow the track of the sun, which are \u201cvery useful in sunnier areas\u201d. The London-based solar giant, in which BP holds a 43% stake, is expanding quickly after it won the backing of the oil giant in 2017. BP returned to the solar market after a six-year hiatus, with plans to grow Lightsource in India, the US and the Middle East. It is already Europe\u2019s largest utility-scale solar developer and more than $3bn (\u00a32.4bn) has been invested across almost 2GW of solar projects around the world. Last week it announced plans to buy 1.9GW worth of solar projects in Brazil from the independent renewables developer Enerlife, for an undisclosed sum.",

      "bodyText": "Fronted by a dramatic gated arch, its roads fringed with neatly trimmed hedges, palm trees and lush grass, Bahria Town bears little resemblance to the urban chaos of nearby Karachi. The economic heart of Pakistan is an overcrowded and often violent megacity with an official population of 15 million (closer to 20 million if the urban sprawl beyond the city perimeter is included). Infrastructure has not kept pace with its rapid expansion, and basic amenities such as water have become a commodity for criminal gangs. The city is also an organisational centre for the Pakistani Taliban, who attacked the airport in 2014.

      "bodyText": "Paramedics saved the life of one of the Wiltshire novichok victims by administering an anti-nerve agent drug at the scene that had never been used on a patient before in the UK, it can be revealed. The Guardian has also learned that a number of paramedics have reported feeling ill after being present at the Salisbury and Amesbury incidents. One of the paramedics who had helped the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter when they collapsed in Salisbury was among those who went to the aid of Charlie Rowley when he also fell critically ill four months later in Amesbury. Instinct told him that a second nerve agent poisoning may have taken place and Rowley was given the drug. Speaking in detail for the first time about its role responding to the poisonings a year ago, South Western Ambulance Service NHS foundation trust (SWASFT) said it believed this saved Rowley\u2019s life. SWASFT also confirmed that staff had reported symptoms including headaches, sore throats and eye problems, and that some remained concerned about the possible long-term effects on their health. The health problems reported by the paramedics raise the possibility that more people were affected by novichok than has been officially stated. The attack on Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in March last year was the first time chemical weapons had been used in Europe since the second world war and put huge pressure on all the emergency services. Wayne Darch, the head of emergency preparedness, resilience and response at SWASFT, said: \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a plan on the shelf for what we were dealing with. We were writing the book as we were dealing with the situation put in front of us. It was intense.\u201d SWASFT believes the actions of its staff tending to the Skripals at the scene and in ambulances on the way to Salisbury district hospital also saved them. Almost four months later, on 30 June 2018, Rowley and his partner, Dawn Sturgess, fell ill at his flat in Amesbury, eight miles north of Salisbury, after opening a fake bottle of perfume that he had found in a charity shop bin. It turned out to contain novichok. Sturgess sprayed it over her wrists and became severely ill. Paramedics were called to help her on the morning of 30 June and she was taken to Salisbury district hospital. When they were called again to the same flat later that day to tend to Rowley, a lead paramedic who had been present when the Skripals fell ill suspected that nerve agent was again involved. Rowley was given an anti-nerve agent drug that British crews began to carry at the height of the al-Qaida threat but had not used until then. Rowley survived, though he continues to suffer physically and mentally. Sturgess, a mother of three, died. Darch said the first call to Rowley\u2019s flat following Sturgess\u2019s collapse came at 10.15am and the response was relatively straightforward. There was nothing that made the paramedics think that it could have been a second novichok poisoning. When a second 999 call came through at 6.20pm for the same address, the control room flagged this up to the local commander. \u201cIt\u2019s unusual that we would get called to the same address on the same day for two separate patients,\u201d said Darch. By chance, the commander was one of those that had helped the Skripals. He attended Rowley\u2019s address in person. \u201cThe crew that attended Charlie took a particular course of treatment,\u201d said Darch. \u201cWhen that wasn\u2019t effective, they suspected that it may be nerve agent.\u201d Though there was no information or intelligence that Rowley had been the victim of a nerve agent, the paramedics donned protective clothing \u2013 Tyvek suits, face masks, gloves and aprons \u2013 and treated Rowley as if there had been a second attack.

It has created a situation where \u201cthe UK government is providing climate aid with one hand and exporting the UK\u2019s fossil fuel pollution with the other\u201d, the report found.",

A common explanation for the decline of leftwing parties over the past quarter century is their inability to speak to rightwing concerns. But Syriza shows that mimicking the right does little to slow its rise. On the contrary, Tsipras\u2019s flirtation with militarism and neoliberalism caused his party to lose its core identity, emboldening its opponents along the way. Why settle for Syriza\u2019s centre-right pandering, many voters asked, when you could have the real thing?</p> \n<p>The second is not to invest the hopes of a movement in the figure of a politician. It is a common refrain in Greece that \u201cTsipras is Syriza\u201d: he is the only one with the political wiles to hold together the disparate factions of the Greek left. But like a pyramid flipped on its head, the personification of Syriza\u2019s platform made its politics highly unstable, liable to tip in any direction that Tsipras chose to lean. Only a party that is sufficiently grounded in a social movement \u2013 where the base of the pyramid holds its head to account \u2013 can remain true to its founding principles, particularly in a context as volatile as Greece.</p> \n<p>And the third is to keep the flame of rebellion alive. Syriza rose to power on its promise to challenge the status quo courageously and creatively. \u201cHope is coming,\u201d its slogan assured. Voters understood that the chances for radical change were slim \u2013 but they trusted Tsipras to fight anyway. When Syriza became the purveyor of injustice instead, that spirit of rebellion was lost, and its base of support collapsed along with it.</p> \n<p><em>\u2022 </em>David Adler is a writer and a member of DiEM25\u2019s Coordinating Collective.

A common explanation for the decline of leftwing parties over the past quarter century is their inability to speak to rightwing concerns. But Syriza shows that mimicking the right does little to slow its rise. On the contrary, Tsipras\u2019s flirtation with militarism and neoliberalism caused his party to lose its core identity, emboldening its opponents along the way. Why settle for Syriza\u2019s centre-right pandering, many voters asked, when you could have the real thing? The second is not to invest the hopes of a movement in the figure of a politician. It is a common refrain in Greece that \u201cTsipras is Syriza\u201d: he is the only one with the political wiles to hold together the disparate factions of the Greek left. But like a pyramid flipped on its head, the personification of Syriza\u2019s platform made its politics highly unstable, liable to tip in any direction that Tsipras chose to lean. Only a party that is sufficiently grounded in a social movement \u2013 where the base of the pyramid holds its head to account \u2013 can remain true to its founding principles, particularly in a context as volatile as Greece. And the third is to keep the flame of rebellion alive. Syriza rose to power on its promise to challenge the status quo courageously and creatively. \u201cHope is coming,\u201d its slogan assured. Voters understood that the chances for radical change were slim \u2013 but they trusted Tsipras to fight anyway. When Syriza became the purveyor of injustice instead, that spirit of rebellion was lost, and its base of support collapsed along with it. \u2022 David Adler is a writer and a member of DiEM25\u2019s Coordinating Collective.

      "bodyText": "Deutsche Bank started slashing thousands of jobs in the City of London and in New York only hours after announcing a drastic plan to reduce its global workforce by 18,000. Germany\u2019s biggest lender employs almost 8,000 people in the UK, with 7,000 in London, which is one of the main hubs for its global investment bank, where the bulk of the job losses will be focused. The jobs being cut make up about a fifth of Deutsche\u2019s global workforce of 91,500. Some staff in London were reported to be in tears after hearing that their jobs had gone. Workers started leaving the bank\u2019s building in the City at around 10am carrying bags of belongings. Some said they were told their passes would stop working at 11am. A male contract worker on his way into the building in Great Winchester Street said: \u201cThe bank is not doing well, so they have to do something to get back up and running.\u201d Deutsche has failed to recover from the financial crisis of 2008 and, faced with rising costs and a falling share price, Deutsche\u2019s chief executive, Christian Sewing, is shutting the division that sells and trades shares and cutting back on the bank\u2019s other businesses. The shares, which peaked at \u20ac110 in 2007, have crashed to less than \u20ac7, and lost another 5% when details of the job cuts were revealed. The cull started in the Asia Pacific region, soon after the cuts were confirmed on Sunday evening in Europe, with employees being let go in Sydney and Hong Kong. A Hong Kong equities trader told Reuters the mood was gloomy as people were called individually to meetings. \u201c[There are a] couple of rounds of chats with HR, and then they give you this packet and you are out of the building,\u201d the trader said. In New York, hundreds of workers were summoned to the cafeteria at Deutsche\u2019s Wall Street office to hear their fates. Employees were seen leaving with their redundancy terms in large white envelopes. Staff at the nearby Full Shilling Irish bar were expecting laid-off Deutsche workers to congregate in the afternoon. After suffering big losses in the wake of the financial crisis and also in four of the past five years, Deutsche Bank\u2019s problems have raised fears about its future among German government ministers. Berlin encouraged it to discuss a merger with its German rival Commerzbank, but talks ended in April, leaving Sewing to look for other means to safeguard the 149-year-old bank\u2019s future. Sewing, who travelled to London to announce the cuts outlined on Sunday, expects to spend \u20ac7.4bn in order to cut the bank\u2019s annual running costs by \u20ac6bn a year by 2022. Deutsche is also separating \u20ac74bn of bad loans and risky derivative contracts into a so-called bad bank, to be run down or sold to banks under less pressure. Sewing also pledged to invest an extra \u20ac13bn in technology and increase revenue in the core bank. He promised not to ask shareholders for fresh funds. They have already stumped up almost \u20ac30bn in the past decade, only to see the company\u2019s market value plunge to half that amount. Analysts at the US bank JP Morgan said Deutsche\u2019s plan was \u201cfor the first time not half-baked\u201d. But they also pointed out the bank\u2019s poor record on executing plans, and questioned how motivated investment bank employees would be to revive the remaining business. Deutsche indicated that it could post another loss this year. It has already been through a series of attempted revamps, but without the big overhauls put in place by rivals such as Royal Bank of Scotland.

Job losses will affect frontline traders and support staff in areas such as IT and compliance. The cuts will undo decades of expansion as Deutsche tried to compete with the biggest Wall Street firms such as Goldman Sachs. It made bold moves in the late 80s and 90s, buying Morgan Grenfell in London and Bankers Trust in the US. Deutsche earned the grudging respect of Wall Street rivals during the boom years leading up to the financial crisis, but the bank, which was a big player in the mortgage bonds at the centre of the US subprime crisis, struggled in the aftermath.

Supporting roles followed in several dozen movies during the 50s, as a sailor in Gift Horse (1952, alongside Trevor Howard), and in The Cruel Sea (1953, with Jack Hawkins), as Joan Collins\u2019s boyfriend in Turn the Key Softly (1953), an army corporal in Private\u2019s Progress (1956, with Carmichael), and a detective in Tiger Bay (1959, with John and Hayley Mills). A talented footballer and rugby player at school, he was catapulted into a leading role as the star player in The Great Game (1952), a football drama, and enjoyed returning to comedy to act as a foil to Norman Wisdom in Follow a Star (1959), There Was a Crooked Man (1960), The Bulldog Breed (1960) and A Stitch in Time (1963). On radio Houston played two characters \u2013 Arthur Evans (1962) and Joe Higgins (1963-66) \u2013 in the soap opera The Dales. Thereafter, apart from joining Donald in the 1980 wartime drama The Sea Wolves, his career was consumed by television roles. They included Bob Berris, Leslie Crowther\u2019s darts partner, in the last two series (1972-73) of the sitcom My Good Woman, and Margaret Thatcher\u2019s press secretary, Bernard Ingham, in Thatcher: The Final Days (1991). He had made his West End stage debut in The Happy Family at the Duchess theatre in London in 1951, but turned down various Shakespearean roles, something that may well have restricted his career on the boards. \u201cI always worried about learning the lines,\u201d he said. \u201cMy one regret is that I didn\u2019t become a leading classical actor. I think it\u2019s what you have to do, like Anthony Hopkins. He never liked working in theatre, but he did all those Shakespeare roles.\u201d He won a Bafta Cymru lifetime achievement award in 2008. A year later his autobiography, A Black &amp; White Actor, was published. In 1956 he married the actor and model Shirley Lawrence. She died in 2016. He is survived by their two daughters, Leigh and Karen. \u2022 Glyn (Glyndwr Desmond) Houston, actor, born 23 October 1925; died 30 June 2019",

      "bodyText": "Heather Mills has received an apology at the high court after settling her phone-hacking case against the News of the World in return for a substantial financial payout as part of an agreement under which she dropped similar claims against the Sun. The former wife of the Beatles singer Sir Paul McCartney said a \u201ccriminal, targeted smear campaign\u201d over the course of a decade by the news outlet had destroyed her reputation and left her unable to carry on her charity work. Mills was one of about 90 individuals, including Sir Elton John and Elizabeth Hurley, who recently settled their cases for invasion of privacy against News Group Newspapers, the Rupert Murdoch-controlled publisher that owns the News of the World and the Sun. At a pre-trial hearing the high court heard claims from Mills\u2019 lawyer that phone hacking was widespread at both newspapers, citing 141 articles published across the two titles that they believed were based on unlawful information gathering. However, in common with other phone-hacking settlements, the settlement was reached on the basis that wrongdoing was confined to journalists at the defunct News of the World. The company made no admission of liability in relation to their allegations of voicemail interception or other unlawful information gathering at the Sun. The cost of phone hacking has weighed heavily on the financial performance of the Sun\u2019s publisher for the past decade, with the company setting aside \u00a314.7m in its 2018 accounts to deal with costs relating to ongoing cases. The enormous number of individuals involved means cases are still ongoing, with another tranche of claims being made, as lawyers continue to work their way through the backlog. The cost is significant at a time of collapsing newspaper sales, which have prompted the Sun to make substantial cuts to its editorial budgets. The phone-hacking scandal has been ongoing since 2006, when the News of the World\u2019s royal editor pleaded guilty to phone hacking.

      "bodyText": "The wrecks of two Dutch submarines sunk off the Malaysian coast during the second world war have disappeared along with the remains of the 79 men who perished onboard. Researchers discovered just a few remains of HNLMS O 16 and a mere outline in the seabed of the hull of HNLMS K XVII after investigating a possible disturbance. Both submarines were sunk by Japanese mines in the South China Sea in December 1941 at a cost of all but one of their crews. The discovery highlights the continued difficulty of protecting war wrecks, which are supposed to be protected under international treaties from being disturbed. Jet Bussemaker, the granddaughter of Anton Bussemaker, who commanded and died on the O 16 at the age of 41, said the news had been shocking to the relatives of those whose lives were lost on the submarines. Bussemaker, a former minister responsible for veterans, added it should not come as a surprise given the intense activities of salvagers in the seas around Indonesia and Malaysia. Last August, the then British defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, condemned the damage done by looters to Royal Navy battleships sunk in those seas. Bussemaker said: \u201cIt is a very sad message.

      "body": "<p>Fort William haven\u2019t won a Highland League game for more than two years. Last season they picked up two draws in 34 matches, scoring 21 goals and conceding 245. A nine-point penalty for fielding an ineligible player meant they ended on -7 points. But the numbers only tell half the story.</p> <p>The club began the season with a handful of first-team players and fielded teams of teenagers in order to keep football alive in this remote corner of Scotland. The scorelines were monstrous \u2013 they lost 10 games by 10 goals or more \u2013 but fuelled a media interest that gave the club a platform to tell their story, attract a whole new fan base, and rediscover their soul.</p> <h2><strong>The chairman</strong></h2> <p>When asked to explain the growing support for Fort William, Peter Murphy cuts to the chase. \u201cFootball fans will generally root for either successful teams or the underdog \u2013 and we\u2019re clearly not successful right now.</p> <p>\u201cSomeone might be watching the results come in and think: \u2018My team\u2019s doing bad, but not as bad as Fort William.\u2019 From there, they\u2019ll end up on our social media and find out there\u2019s more to this club than just a team getting thrashed every week.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These are young boys doing their best. When people laugh at us, it's heartbreaking</p> <footer> <cite>Peter Murphy, chairman</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As a player, Murphy was part of a successful Fort William side that joined the Highland League in the 1980s. He played for his hometown side for nearly 15 years, but when he returned for a charity game last summer he found a club on the brink.

      "bodyText": "Fort William haven\u2019t won a Highland League game for more than two years. Last season they picked up two draws in 34 matches, scoring 21 goals and conceding 245. A nine-point penalty for fielding an ineligible player meant they ended on -7 points. But the numbers only tell half the story. The club began the season with a handful of first-team players and fielded teams of teenagers in order to keep football alive in this remote corner of Scotland. The scorelines were monstrous \u2013 they lost 10 games by 10 goals or more \u2013 but fuelled a media interest that gave the club a platform to tell their story, attract a whole new fan base, and rediscover their soul. The chairman When asked to explain the growing support for Fort William, Peter Murphy cuts to the chase. \u201cFootball fans will generally root for either successful teams or the underdog \u2013 and we\u2019re clearly not successful right now. \u201cSomeone might be watching the results come in and think: \u2018My team\u2019s doing bad, but not as bad as Fort William.\u2019 From there, they\u2019ll end up on our social media and find out there\u2019s more to this club than just a team getting thrashed every week.\u201d As a player, Murphy was part of a successful Fort William side that joined the Highland League in the 1980s. He played for his hometown side for nearly 15 years, but when he returned for a charity game last summer he found a club on the brink. They were offered the chance to drop into the North Caledonian League but declined. \u201cIf we\u2019d stepped down, we might have had more success on the park, but it would have been the beginning of the end for the club,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cIt was a calculated risk.\u201d Fort William\u2019s existence is vital to maintaining youth football in the region, with the club\u2019s local rivals, Clachnacuddin, 66 miles away in Inverness.

      "bodyText": "Lucy Bronze acknowledges that Phil Neville is not quite the finished article but the right-back England\u2019s manager labels \u201cthe world\u2019s best\u201d believes he has succeeded in confounding the doubters during the past month at France 2019. \u201cPhil\u2019s said himself he\u2019s not the best coach with the best tactics,\u201d said Bronze as the Lionesses headed home after ending the World Cup in fourth place. \u201cBut he\u2019s won over the doubters from the moment he stepped in. \u201cHe\u2019s wanted to create relationships with the players, fans and staff and he\u2019s really done that. That\u2019s helped us drive on at this tournament and become a better team.\u201d The Lyon and England defender believes the former Manchester United full-back\u2019s amalgam of emotional intelligence and big-game experience more than compensates for any deficiencies in other spheres \u2013 particularly as his assistant Bev Priestman is a \u201cdevil in the detail\u201d type of coach. \u201cPhil\u2019s man-management is world class so you have to allow him the time to concentrate on it and not get bogged down in the details,\u201d said Priestman. \u201cIt means he can get the best out of every player.\u201d Bronze feels this arrangement plays to Neville\u2019s strengths. \u201cAs a player at the highest level, Phil\u2019s had those experiences and knows how to handle things a little better than other managers might,\u201d she said. Even so, regular England watchers have certain anxieties about Neville\u2019s seeming obsession with building from the back and monopolising possession but his leading player has thoroughly bought into the stylistic changes implemented by England\u2019s coach and remains unconcerned by his dogmatism. \u201cThe way we got to the semi-finals [where England lost 2-1 to the United States] \u2013 unreal,\u201d Bronze said. \u201cWe had the most possession of any team, we completed the most passes of any team. We pushed the USA to the end. Four years ago in Canada we were so happy with the bronze medal; now we\u2019re disappointed not to have won the World Cup.\u201d If the 2-1 third-place play-off defeat by Sweden stripped a little gloss off things inside the dressing room, she was disguising it well. \u201cWe\u2019ve definitely captured imaginations,\u201d she said. \u201cNow we have the Olympics [in Tokyo next year] to look forward to as Team GB. We have a home Euros in 2021 and we can only build on the momentum we\u2019ve created.\u201d To keep doing so England need to improve on the pitch but Bronze feels they are now within touching distance of eclipsing all-comers. \u201cWe\u2019re a team with a high level at most things,\u201d she said. \u201cSet pieces, finishing, quality on the ball, defending. Now we need to push it so we\u2019re the best at everything. There\u2019s not anything we\u2019re really poor at but we need to push every single thing to a new level.\u201d England fans now uneasily familiar with the 20-minute spells of slapdash defending which Neville\u2019s side largely got away with in France think this is an area which requires addressing with some urgency. Bronze, though, sees things very differently. \u201cYou can\u2019t name any team that hasn\u2019t had that,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that\u2019s impossible in football. We can\u2019t expect to spend 90 minutes on the ball when we\u2019re playing the best teams in the world. You can\u2019t do that. That\u2019s the English media wanting us to play the perfect game. It\u2019s not there \u2013 and we had 11 players in our squad who hadn\u2019t been to a World Cup before.\u201d",

I like Bus Station not least for its sheer unexpectedness (it\u2019s placed between two more landscape oriented poems) and for the way that as it unfolds it continues to see things clearly, and resist making the obvious judgment. The smartphone users Pugh has assembled in the small bus station are not there to be turned into stereotypes of the misguided modern human, patronised for \u201cstaring / intently into their palms\u201d. If the poem\u2019s tack is to engage with a sense of how things could be or should be, it\u2019s not in the usual formulation, where \u201cthese people should be talking to each other!\u201d The focus is on the extraordinary quietness of their technologically dazzling electronic communications, and on imagining \u201cthe sound this glow would make\u201d.</p> <p>The poem itself uses sound with remarkable skill. There are the repetitions in the first couplet, \u201cmove/not moving\u201d. \u201cbecalmed/between\u201d: the combination of pace-slowing consonants and rhythmic jolts suggests the physical process of setting down baggage, settling awkwardly into seats, adjusting from action to stasis, giving up one\u2019s weight to the wait. After the caesura in the first line of the second couplet, \u201cDead quiet\u201d is a forceful pairing, and again produces a slowing of the tempo. But everything changes and becomes light and speedy in the third couplet, where the short \u201ci\u201d sounds dance like fingertips.</p> <p>Now the swiftness of the exchanges is mimed in a sketchy itemisation of knowledge. Levels of significance are flattened. Economics and warfare impinge, and pass in an instant.

      "bodyText": "Bus Station Passengers on the move, not moving, becalmed in a between place on the way elsewhere. Dead quiet, staring intently into their palms. They are talking with their quick fingers, eyes flickering, picking up messages, catching the latest news. They know the price of gold, what\u2019s happening in Iran, tomorrow\u2019s weather; they scan the world, their faces backlit; they are no spectators but part of the play, tuned in to a global exchange where thoughts, facts, rumours, insults zip along wires like cash on a Baldwin Flyer. It\u2019s off-key, this silence, it should hum, crackle with static, we should hear a buzz pitched just too low for eavesdroppers, the sound this glow would make, that wells from a dozen tiny screens into the room whose windows are dark with winter, looking out only on our own reflections. Despite the haunting title poem and other finely observed, Shetland-based studies of seascape and season, in her latest collection Afternoons Go Nowhere Sheenagh Pugh\u2019s alertness to human characters, situations and voices, historical and contemporary, continues undiminished. I like Bus Station not least for its sheer unexpectedness (it\u2019s placed between two more landscape oriented poems) and for the way that as it unfolds it continues to see things clearly, and resist making the obvious judgment. The smartphone users Pugh has assembled in the small bus station are not there to be turned into stereotypes of the misguided modern human, patronised for \u201cstaring / intently into their palms\u201d. If the poem\u2019s tack is to engage with a sense of how things could be or should be, it\u2019s not in the usual formulation, where \u201cthese people should be talking to each other!\u201d The focus is on the extraordinary quietness of their technologically dazzling electronic communications, and on imagining \u201cthe sound this glow would make\u201d. The poem itself uses sound with remarkable skill. There are the repetitions in the first couplet, \u201cmove/not moving\u201d. \u201cbecalmed/between\u201d: the combination of pace-slowing consonants and rhythmic jolts suggests the physical process of setting down baggage, settling awkwardly into seats, adjusting from action to stasis, giving up one\u2019s weight to the wait. After the caesura in the first line of the second couplet, \u201cDead quiet\u201d is a forceful pairing, and again produces a slowing of the tempo. But everything changes and becomes light and speedy in the third couplet, where the short \u201ci\u201d sounds dance like fingertips. Now the swiftness of the exchanges is mimed in a sketchy itemisation of knowledge. Levels of significance are flattened. Economics and warfare impinge, and pass in an instant. We slip from \u201cthe price of gold\u201d and \u201cwhat\u2019s happening in Iran\u201d to the social-media jumble sale where \u201cthoughts, // facts, rumours, insults zip along wires / like cash on a Baldwin Flyer\u201d. And with that wry simile we\u2019re suddenly back in old technology, where you could see the excitement of trade and hear the hum \u2013 or was it more of a rattle? A little before this, the poem has taken us on an even older metaphorical ride, with its reference to the faces as \u201cbacklit\u201d and the smartphone users \u201cno spectators // but part of the play\u201d.

Last year, these people were set back when the deyr season produced less rain than usual.

In racing, Arkle is remembered for being so far ahead of his contemporaries that handicappers had to change their approach for races he was due to run in. Alongside him, we can now put Frankie Dettori, who is so talented and so popular that bookmakers have started to change the terms on which they accept wildly optimistic accumulators.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/06/frankie-dettori-hails-unbelievable-enable-after-coral-eclipse-victory\">Frankie Dettori hails \u2018unbelievable\u2019 Enable after Eclipse victory</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Skybet and bet365 have restricted the number of Dettori-ridden horses that can be permed together. Coral accepted Dettori accas on Saturday only on the basis that the final two runners would be paid at starting price, not the morning odds. Other firms have limited stakes.</p> \n<p>I prefer my bookmakers to be a little braver, bearing in mind that they have been quietly salting away the stakes placed on such wacky bets for decades, but two factors explain why they\u2019re ducking for cover just now. One, it might be 25,000-1 or bigger against Dettori going through the card on a major raceday but an increasing number of punters are throwing a few coins on it, just in case. Two, the Italian is so full of fire at the moment that it could really happen, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/26/frankie-dettori-celebrates-20th-anniversary-winning-all-seven-races-ascot\">again</a>.</p> \n<p>Honestly, would you be surprised if he rode every winner at Newmarket one day this week? It would be impressive, but hardly unexpected, given the way he\u2019s riding.</p> \n<p>And that\u2019s the point I wanted to make this morning, how astonishing it is that a battered old jockey should be at the peak of his powers at the age of 48. To be as good as he is now, Dettori has overcome not just the effects of ageing but the caprice of fashion. When he came back from his drugs ban in 2013, he was so neglected by trainers and owners that he ended the year with just 16 winners at an 8% strike-rate.</p> \n<p>Confidence has always been important to him and I don\u2019t suppose he had much of it at that point. How different things are now, with nine winners from 14 rides over the past eight days, in which time he has won the Eclipse, the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud and the Prix Jean Prat and even found time to nip over to Siena to watch the Palio.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/07/sea-of-class-fights-for-life\">Sea Of Class fights for life after colic attack ends filly\u2019s career</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Dettori\u2019s strike-rate in Britain this season is 29%. If he can sustain that to the end of the year, it will be easily the best of his career. Some press-room colleagues are striking a slightly miserabilist tone just now, responding to each of his wins by saying how much we\u2019ll miss him, which is certainly true. But let\u2019s not forget to marvel at what\u2019s happening in front of us every Saturday. This rebuilt, revived Dettori is a phenomenon and surely retirement must be years off while he\u2019s riding like this.</p> \n<p>Even the stewards appear to be in his thrall. With the safety of his fellow jockeys in mind, I do hope there will be no repeat of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AtTheRaces/status/1147879904735744000\">the interference he was allowed to get away with</a> at Deauville on Sunday.</p> \n<h2>Monday\u2019s best bets, by Chris Cook</h2> \n<p>There\u2019s no Dettori today but we do have Nigel Tinkler. At 61, the trainer probably doesn\u2019t celebrate quite like the Italian but he is in similar form, with nine winners at 29% over the past two weeks. I\u2019d very much like him to keep that run going for at least another day, as I fancy both his runners.</p> \n<p>At Ayr, he fields <strong>Hello Girl (2.30)</strong>, who rewarded market support by scoring at Lingfield nine days ago.

      "bodyText": "Only a tiny number of athletes are so good that they change the way the game is organised. In racing, Arkle is remembered for being so far ahead of his contemporaries that handicappers had to change their approach for races he was due to run in. Alongside him, we can now put Frankie Dettori, who is so talented and so popular that bookmakers have started to change the terms on which they accept wildly optimistic accumulators. Skybet and bet365 have restricted the number of Dettori-ridden horses that can be permed together. Coral accepted Dettori accas on Saturday only on the basis that the final two runners would be paid at starting price, not the morning odds. Other firms have limited stakes. I prefer my bookmakers to be a little braver, bearing in mind that they have been quietly salting away the stakes placed on such wacky bets for decades, but two factors explain why they\u2019re ducking for cover just now. One, it might be 25,000-1 or bigger against Dettori going through the card on a major raceday but an increasing number of punters are throwing a few coins on it, just in case. Two, the Italian is so full of fire at the moment that it could really happen, again. Honestly, would you be surprised if he rode every winner at Newmarket one day this week? It would be impressive, but hardly unexpected, given the way he\u2019s riding. And that\u2019s the point I wanted to make this morning, how astonishing it is that a battered old jockey should be at the peak of his powers at the age of 48. To be as good as he is now, Dettori has overcome not just the effects of ageing but the caprice of fashion. When he came back from his drugs ban in 2013, he was so neglected by trainers and owners that he ended the year with just 16 winners at an 8% strike-rate. Confidence has always been important to him and I don\u2019t suppose he had much of it at that point. How different things are now, with nine winners from 14 rides over the past eight days, in which time he has won the Eclipse, the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud and the Prix Jean Prat and even found time to nip over to Siena to watch the Palio. Dettori\u2019s strike-rate in Britain this season is 29%. If he can sustain that to the end of the year, it will be easily the best of his career. Some press-room colleagues are striking a slightly miserabilist tone just now, responding to each of his wins by saying how much we\u2019ll miss him, which is certainly true. But let\u2019s not forget to marvel at what\u2019s happening in front of us every Saturday. This rebuilt, revived Dettori is a phenomenon and surely retirement must be years off while he\u2019s riding like this. Even the stewards appear to be in his thrall. With the safety of his fellow jockeys in mind, I do hope there will be no repeat of the interference he was allowed to get away with at Deauville on Sunday. Monday\u2019s best bets, by Chris Cook There\u2019s no Dettori today but we do have Nigel Tinkler. At 61, the trainer probably doesn\u2019t celebrate quite like the Italian but he is in similar form, with nine winners at 29% over the past two weeks. I\u2019d very much like him to keep that run going for at least another day, as I fancy both his runners. At Ayr, he fields Hello Girl (2.30), who rewarded market support by scoring at Lingfield nine days ago. That was her first success since 2017 but it was only her second outing since switching yards and evidently a big run was expected. Today\u2019s run has a flavour of \u2018after the Lord Mayor\u2019s show\u2019 about it but she\u2019s only 4lb higher, is still in Class 6 company and gets fast ground again. It\u2019s a big field but I\u2019ll cheerfully take 9-2. More speculatively, Linda Perrett\u2019s Retirement Beckons (5.00) could outrun odds of 14-1. He was a close fourth after pulling hard over a mile here in May and this shorter trip should help. At Ripon this evening, Tinkler has a fair chance with the 6-1 Flying Raconteur (7.10), an unlucky third on his handicap debut recently. An hour later, the nap is Sameem (8.10), returning to calmer waters after being well held in the Britannia. He\u2019s nicely treated as the only three-year-old in a winnable race.",

Winning the Turner prize the following year brought a deluge of journalists \u2013 and international collectors asking if they could buy the houses. But it didn\u2019t speed things up. Five years later, the homes have just been finished. \u201cFive years to do 10 chuffing houses,\u201d sighs resident Hazel Tilley, 64. \u201cThere were delays on every front \u2013 delays with the builders, delays with funding, delays in our knowledge, delays with the council. It\u2019s nearly 29 years since I first got involved and I\u2019m knackered.\u201d</p> <p>Their frustrations and fury have paid off.

      "bodyText": "From the outside, they look like any other houses in the street, with their big bay windows framed by chunky liver-coloured sandstone, and bright-blue front doors in brick-arched openings. But there\u2019s something strange going on. You can see the sky through the first-floor windows, and exotic leaves are pressing up against the panes. Step inside and, rather than a standard two-up two-down, you\u2019re confronted with a lush scene of ferns, lilies and full-sized beech trees, while fronds of star jasmine wind up the stair banisters towards a greenhouse roof. This is the Granby Winter Garden, the latest phase of architecture collective Assemble\u2019s work in Liverpool. This innocuous street of terraced houses was catapulted to worldwide acclaim by the 2015 Turner prize. Assemble, a young practice, won the hallowed gong after a group of plucky residents took control of their street, having endured decades of \u201cmanaged decline\u201d that had seen the neighbourhood abandoned by the council and left to rot. It was an intoxicating David-and-Goliath tale: a band of angry women taking on the authorities, organising guerrilla gardening and a street market, hatching a plan for a community land trust (CLT), and getting Assemble involved to transform abandoned houses into beautiful, permanently affordable homes. Easy as that, hugs and teary eyes all round. The reality wasn\u2019t quite so simple. \u201cIt was bloody hard work,\u201d says Eleanor Lee, who has lived on Cairns Street for 46 years, a few doors down from the winter garden. It was Lee, now 70, who finally cracked back in the mid-noughties, after years of seeing her neighbourhood fall into disrepair, taking a pickaxe to the pavement to start planting ivy in front of some abandoned houses. \u201cIt\u2019s taken a lot longer and been a lot harder to pull off than we ever thought.\u201d When I first visited Granby, in November 2014, Assemble was planning to have the first 10 homes done up by March. Winning the Turner prize the following year brought a deluge of journalists \u2013 and international collectors asking if they could buy the houses. But it didn\u2019t speed things up. Five years later, the homes have just been finished. \u201cFive years to do 10 chuffing houses,\u201d sighs resident Hazel Tilley, 64. \u201cThere were delays on every front \u2013 delays with the builders, delays with funding, delays in our knowledge, delays with the council. It\u2019s nearly 29 years since I first got involved and I\u2019m knackered.\u201d Their frustrations and fury have paid off. There are still a few tinned-up buildings on the street, but the CLT homes now stand out with smartly painted bay windows in chalky shades of blue, green and grey, providing homes for those most in need at affordable rents that will be tied to local wages for ever. Half of the houses were for sale and half for rent, priced at \u00a399,000 to buy or \u00a3480 per month to rent \u2013 almost half the amount being charged by private landlords in the Welsh Streets nearby. \u201cIt\u2019s a dream come true,\u201d says Emily Alexander, 33, who moved in to one of the first houses with her 11-year-old daughter. \u201cI lived in this street when I was six, back when it was all slum landlords and rats, and they were trying to get everyone out.

Rapinoe calls for \u2018next step\u2019 on equal pay after US victory The USA\u2019s fourth Women\u2019s World Cup win on Sunday was not just a sporting triumph, but arguably a social and political one, too. Following the 2-0 victory over the Netherlands at the Stade de Lyon, goalscorer Megan Rapinoe called for the debate on equal pay to move forward. The US co-captain, a champion of LGBTQ rights, had also become embroiled in a row with Donald Trump earlier in the tournament, but Trump nonetheless tweeted his congratulations to the team, praising their \u201cgreat and exciting play\u201d. Band of Sisters. The USA\u2019s 2019 team played without the factionalism that has afflicted previous World Cup squads, writes Caitlin Murray. Classic goals. The Guardian\u2019s sports team looks at how Rose Lavelle\u2019s deciding strike compares to previous World Cup final classics. Migrant children victims of \u2018emergency public health crisis\u2019 An immigrant rights lawyer who gained rare access to a migrant detention centre in Clint, Texas, has told the Guardian that hundreds of children are being held there in \u201cinhumane\u201d conditions, which add up to an \u201cemergency public health crisis\u201d. Elora Mukherjee, the director of Columbia Law School\u2019s immigrant rights clinic, said the children had no adequate access to medical care, drinking water, food or sanitation, and called for them to have immediate access to doctors. Border bill. A bill providing the administration with $4.59bn in border security funding has driven a wedge between Democratic leaders and progressives such as Ilhan Omar, who called it \u201ca vote to keep kids in cages\u201d. UK minister defends ambassador over Trump criticisms The UK\u2019s international trade secretary has leapt to the defence of the country\u2019s ambassador to Washington, Kim Darroch, following the leak of confidential memos in which Darroch described Trump\u2019s White House as \u201cuniquely dysfunctional\u201d and \u201cinept\u201d. Liam Fox told the BBC that Darroch was held \u201cin high regard\u201d on both sides of the Atlantic, and said whoever had leaked the briefing to the Mail on Sunday newspaper was \u201cunethical\u201d and \u201cunpatriotic\u201d. Trump response. Asked about the controversy on Sunday evening, Trump said Darroch had \u201cnot served the UK well\u201d, adding: \u201cWe are not big fans of that man.\u201d Farage furore. Nigel Farage, the leader of Britain\u2019s Brexit party, called for Darroch to resign over the leaks. Trump has previously suggested that Farage himself would make a \u201cgreat\u201d ambassador to the US. White House still pursuing census citizenship question Trump is still demanding a controversial question on citizenship be added to the 2020 US census, despite a June ruling by the supreme court that appeared to have blocked its inclusion. The administration previously said it would abide by the ruling and print the census forms without the question. But on Sunday it was announced a new team of lawyers would handle census-related cases at the Department of Justice, which has been looking at ways to add the question, including via a presidential executive order. Inaccurate survey. Critics say the citizenship question would dissuade immigrants from submitting their census forms, leading to an inaccurate survey with potentially major political ramifications. Crib sheet Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s so-called war on drugs is in fact a \u201clarge-scale murdering enterprise\u201d that ought to see the Philippines president investigated by the UN for crimes against humanity, according to a new report by Amnesty. The centre-right New Democracy party has won the Greek elections by a landslide, defeating the leftwing Syriza government, while the neo-fascist Golden Dawn party failed to reach the 3% threshold required to secure any seats in the Greek parliament. Mandla Maseko, a South African who earned the nickname \u201cAfronaut\u201d because he was set to become the first African in space, has died in a motorcycle crash before getting the chance to take his seat on the Lynx Mark II spaceship. A free climber has scaled London\u2019s tallest building, the Shard, reportedly making most of the ascent without ropes or suction cups. Police spoke to the man after he reached the top of the 1,017ft skyscraper early on Monday, but did not arrest him.

With more than 100 town halls and 35,000 selfies, she has done the groundwork. However, writes Lauren Gambino, it\u2019s Warren\u2019s policy chops that set her apart.

This neighbourhood in Manila is a microcosm of communities across south-east Asia, which have become a dumping ground for the world\u2019s waste, reports Carmela Fonbuena.

Yet some fear it has also diminished the desired difficulty of thru-hiking, once considered the ultimate test of self-reliance, as Taylor Gee discovers. Could deepfakes put actors out of business? Movies, videogames and politically charged \u201cdeepfakes\u201d have all already demonstrated the remarkable and troubling potential of \u201cdigital humans\u201d. Luke Kemp asks whether virtual technology could one day make professional actors redundant. Opinion A congressional inquiry has raised the troubling possibility that Jared Kushner is influencing US foreign policy in pursuit of his own family\u2019s business interests, says Mohamad Bazzi. Did Jared Kushner support a blockade of a US ally as political payback because it would not fund his family\u2019s business? Sport The US men\u2019s soccer team lost to their old rivals Mexico in the Gold Cup final in Chicago on Sunday, with a 73rd-minute goal from Jonathan dos Santos settling the match at 1-0 and securing an eighth Concacaf title for the Mexicans.

Liban Malhamoub, who lives in Enfield, will also face a count of threatening with a blade or sharply pointed article in a public place. He was charged early on Monday morning and will appear at Highbury Corner magistrates court later on Monday. Police had been called at about midday on Saturday to Livingstone Road, a residential street just off North Circular Road in Bounds Green. A woman in her 30s and three children aged under 12 were found with stab injuries. One of the children, a girl aged 11, was initially in a critical condition, police said, but all were now in non-life-threatening conditions in hospital. DS Joe Stewart, of Enfield criminal investigation department, said on Saturday: \u201cThis was an appalling attack on a woman and her young children. They have sustained very serious injuries. Our thoughts are with them as they continue to receive vital treatment in hospital. \u201cAttacks like this on such young people are extremely rare.

      "body": "<p>In Deborah Moggach\u2019s latest novel one of the middle-aged characters observes: \u201cOne has to make allowances with the elderly. But he didn\u2019t want to. He wanted his old father back, bristling with questions. He didn\u2019t want to treat his dad like an invalid.\u201d</p> <p>With <em>The Carer</em>, Moggach explores the topical question of care for the elderly and whose responsibility it is. She infuses what could be a dry subject with her trademark humour and pathos, reshaping a societal dilemma into a family drama, by turns compelling and surprising.</p> <p>Robert and Phoebe\u2019s father, James, has broken his hip and needs full-time care. Robert lives in Wimbledon, Phoebe in Wiltshire, and \u201ctheir father\u2019s village lay between the two of them\u201d. In the past, the siblings have argued about which of them should visit at times of crisis: \u201cRobert was nearer, but traffic was diabolical, getting out of London. He also subtly reminded Phoebe that he was a family man, with commitments. In fact, his children had long since left home and all he did was sit in his garden shed trying to write but she didn\u2019t like to point this out, because mentioning his novel wasn\u2019t advisable, dear me no.\u201d</p> <p>So they employ a live-in carer, Mandy, to look after their father. Mandy is \u201cnot beautiful \u2013 far from it. An overweight woman in Rosemary West specs, wearing a bobble hat and stripy tights, something vaguely blokey about her.\u201d And yet within weeks she has inveigled her way into their father\u2019s affections: calling him pet names, escorting him on outings he would have previously sneered at and taking an apparently unhealthy interest in his personal paperwork.</p> <p>Moggach beautifully portrays Phoebe and Robert\u2019s ambivalence towards Mandy: they are scathing about her, but need her. When she begins to behave suspiciously, neither of them dares to corroborate the other for fear of the inevitable consequences: having to fire and replace her, which neither has the time or inclination to do.</p> <p>Mandy\u2019s intimate care of James is described with visceral acuity, as is Robert\u2019s and Phoebe\u2019s squeamishness. Through this quartet, Moggach astutely conveys the complex emotional and transactional dynamics of outsourcing the care of a loved one.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/jun/16/the-ladies-pond-deborah-moggach-so-mayer-and-margaret-drabble-dive-in\">The Ladies\u2019 Pond: three writers dive in</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And yet when the revelation about Mandy\u2019s true motivation is delivered, a third of the way into the story, it is unexpected. Moggach successfully subverts our expectations, taking the novel into unforeseen territory, exploring themes of desire, expectation and the ownership of collective family history.</p> <p>All of this is rich territory, but Moggach\u2019s nuanced characterisations make the subject matter really come alive. Phoebe is \u201ca single woman, of a certain age, and childless. This suggested an Austen-like obligation to others, but she was buggered if she\u2019d let Robert off the hook.\u201d Robert is married to a TV news presenter, but having been made redundant from his job in the City now worries \u201cthat if somebody cut them open they\u2019d be appalled at what they found\u201d. The siblings\u2019 rivalry is vividly conveyed: \u201cskirmishes could still erupt, especially when alcohol was involved\u201d.</p> <p>This, at its heart, is a novel about family mythologies: about the stories we are told and the stories we allow ourselves to believe in order to protect our perceptions of childhood and parents. As Robert and Phoebe observe when they have begun to uncover the truth: \u201cThey knew life was messy \u2013 who didn\u2019t, at their age? \u2013 but nothing had prepared them for this.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Carer</em> by Deborah Moggach is published by Headline (\u00a316.99).

He didn\u2019t want to treat his dad like an invalid.\u201d With The Carer, Moggach explores the topical question of care for the elderly and whose responsibility it is. She infuses what could be a dry subject with her trademark humour and pathos, reshaping a societal dilemma into a family drama, by turns compelling and surprising. Robert and Phoebe\u2019s father, James, has broken his hip and needs full-time care. Robert lives in Wimbledon, Phoebe in Wiltshire, and \u201ctheir father\u2019s village lay between the two of them\u201d. In the past, the siblings have argued about which of them should visit at times of crisis: \u201cRobert was nearer, but traffic was diabolical, getting out of London. He also subtly reminded Phoebe that he was a family man, with commitments. In fact, his children had long since left home and all he did was sit in his garden shed trying to write but she didn\u2019t like to point this out, because mentioning his novel wasn\u2019t advisable, dear me no.\u201d So they employ a live-in carer, Mandy, to look after their father. Mandy is \u201cnot beautiful \u2013 far from it. An overweight woman in Rosemary West specs, wearing a bobble hat and stripy tights, something vaguely blokey about her.\u201d And yet within weeks she has inveigled her way into their father\u2019s affections: calling him pet names, escorting him on outings he would have previously sneered at and taking an apparently unhealthy interest in his personal paperwork. Moggach beautifully portrays Phoebe and Robert\u2019s ambivalence towards Mandy: they are scathing about her, but need her. When she begins to behave suspiciously, neither of them dares to corroborate the other for fear of the inevitable consequences: having to fire and replace her, which neither has the time or inclination to do. Mandy\u2019s intimate care of James is described with visceral acuity, as is Robert\u2019s and Phoebe\u2019s squeamishness. Through this quartet, Moggach astutely conveys the complex emotional and transactional dynamics of outsourcing the care of a loved one. And yet when the revelation about Mandy\u2019s true motivation is delivered, a third of the way into the story, it is unexpected. Moggach successfully subverts our expectations, taking the novel into unforeseen territory, exploring themes of desire, expectation and the ownership of collective family history. All of this is rich territory, but Moggach\u2019s nuanced characterisations make the subject matter really come alive. Phoebe is \u201ca single woman, of a certain age, and childless. This suggested an Austen-like obligation to others, but she was buggered if she\u2019d let Robert off the hook.\u201d Robert is married to a TV news presenter, but having been made redundant from his job in the City now worries \u201cthat if somebody cut them open they\u2019d be appalled at what they found\u201d. The siblings\u2019 rivalry is vividly conveyed: \u201cskirmishes could still erupt, especially when alcohol was involved\u201d. This, at its heart, is a novel about family mythologies: about the stories we are told and the stories we allow ourselves to believe in order to protect our perceptions of childhood and parents. As Robert and Phoebe observe when they have begun to uncover the truth: \u201cThey knew life was messy \u2013 who didn\u2019t, at their age? \u2013 but nothing had prepared them for this.\u201d \u2022 The Carer by Deborah Moggach is published by Headline (\u00a316.99).

By the end of the year, the American Legislative Exchange Council, a non-profit coalition of conservative politicians and industry representatives, had developed model <a href=\"https://www.alec.org/model-policy/critical-infrastructure-protection-act/\">Critical Infrastructure Protection</a> legislation based on Oklahoma\u2019s laws. Energy industry groups immediately sent <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/371677094/ALEC-letter\">a letter</a> to legislators urging them to adopt the bill in their states.</p> <p>That effort has proven fruitful.</p> <p>Louisiana<strong> </strong>passed a version into law in 2018, and the legislative wave picked up speed in 2019. Laws that would increase criminal and civil penalties for protesting against gas and oil pipelines specifically and \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d more broadly have passed this year in Tennessee, Indiana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Texas, and are currently pending in Idaho, Minnesota, Missouri, Illinois, Ohio and Kentucky. In each case, the laws provide for more extreme criminal charges and civil penalties for trespass and vandalism against pipelines.</p> <p>Industry representatives insist these harsh penalties are necessary for pipeline security. \u201cThe intent of the critical infrastructure bill signed into law last year is to protect the safety of Louisiana\u2019s people, environment and infrastructure,\u201d the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association president and general counsel, Tyler Gray, <a href=\"http://www.lmoga.com/news/lmoga-statement-on-critical-infrastructure-protection/\">said in a statement</a> in May. \u201cIt is straightforward in its scope and application and does not infringe on an individual\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d</p> <p>When the Texas law goes into effect on 1 September, it will make \u201cimpairing or interrupting\u201d pipeline construction a felony, punishable by up to two years in jail and a $10,000 fine. If an activist is alleged to have \u201cintent to damage or destroy\u201d a pipeline facility, they could face a third-degree felony on par with attempted murder, and up to 10 years in prison. And any organization found to be similarly culpable could face a $500,000 fine.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be more difficult to give underrepresented communities a voice now because of this,\u201d said Frankie Orona, executive director of Society of Native Nations, which vigorously opposed the bill.</p> <p>Similar measures seem to have support at the federal level. The Trump administration, stacked with former fossil fuel industry lobbyists, attorneys and executives, has come out with its own proposals to protect fossil fuel infrastructure.</p> <p>A June <a href=\"https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/sites/phmsa.dot.gov/files/docs/news/71476/2019-pipeline-safety-reauthorization.pdf\">proposal</a> of the Department of Transportation for \u201cProtecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act\u201d included a provision to expressly strengthen criminal penalties for \u201cimpeding, disrupting, or inhibiting the operation of a pipeline facility\u201d. The head of the Department of Transportation\u2019s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration was formerly <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/trump-town/staffers/howard-r-elliott\">a vice-president</a> of one of the country\u2019s largest coal transporters.</p> <p>The department\u2019s proposal used \u201csome of the same language and ideas in terms of covering peaceful protest activity\u201d, said Elly Page.</p> <h2><strong>Shutting down activist resources</strong></h2> <p>Although the anti-protest laws are highly specific in explicitly or implicitly targeting oil and gas infrastructure, they\u2019re highly vague when it comes to defining what behaviour is prohibited. The laws define \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d as a range of private and public energy facilities, including those that are under construction, but what constitutes imposition, disruption, inhibition or conspiracy is left up to a court\u2019s interpretation, as is what constitutes \u201cintent\u201d to damage property.</p> <p>Yet if preserving infrastructure safety and fossil fuel company profits are the goal, there are already a variety of legal tools available to law enforcement. Trespassing and damaging private property are already crimes in every state. \u201cStates already criminalize most if not all of the conduct that\u2019s covered by these laws,\u201d said Page. \u201cIt seems to be part of a larger effort to stifle certain political speech and environmental groups.\u201d</p> <p>The laws appear designed not just to deter individuals from protesting, but also to cut off material support from organizations by levying steep fines on organizations alleged to conspire with activists. South Dakota\u2019s governor, Kristi Noem, admitted as much about the law in her state in March and<a href=\"https://listen.sdpb.org/post/governor-indicates-george-soros-funding-out-state-protestors\"> said that the law</a> was intended in part to \u201cshut down\u201d activist resources \u2013 she named George Soros as the top \u201cnational offender\u201d.</p> <p>By a particularly cruel twist in South Dakota\u2019s law, which flew through the state legislature in just one week, those fines could actually be used toward the construction of the pipelines activists protest against.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018An industry-created issue\u2019</strong></h2> <p>When off-duty police working as private pipeline security pulled Cindy Spoon off her canoe in southern Louisiana last August and handcuffed her, she didn\u2019t yet know she would be one of the first activists in the country charged with a felony under this new spate of legislation.</p> <p>Spoon was working with the L\u2019eau Est La Vie camp protesting against the construction of the 163-mile Bayou Bridge pipeline, which carries crude oil through the vast wetlands of the Atchafalaya Basin. She was boating in navigable, public waters \u2013 the equivalent of being in the public road. But she was charged with felony trespassing, a little over a week after Louisiana\u2019s protest law went into effect.</p> <p>If the district attorney pursues her case, Spoon could face up to five years in prison. Sixteen activists are currently facing felony charges under the Louisiana law for peaceful protest either in public waterways or on private land where they had the owner\u2019s permission to be.</p> <p>Spoon remains determined to continue her work. \u201cThe risk involved to me personally is far outweighed by inaction,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Spoon\u2019s pro bono attorney Bill Quigley and the Center for Constitutional Rights have filed a <a href=\"https://ccrjustice.org/sites/default/files/attach/2019/05/White%20Hat%20v%20Landry%20Complaint.pdf\">federal suit</a> challenging the law in Louisiana.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not a problem that any private citizen has ever filed a complaint about. This is a total industry-created issue,\u201d said Quigley, a law attorney at Loyola University New Orleans. \u201cThey are essentially passing these laws to give themselves enhanced protection.\u201d When he attended the state senate comment session for the Louisiana law in 2018, Quigley said, he was joined by nearly two dozen fossil fuel industry representatives. \u201cThere were no private citizens.\u201d</p> <p>In South Dakota, the ACLU has filed a suit challenging the law in South Dakota.</p> <p>Dallas Goldtooth, who is Dakota and Din\u00e9, is a named plaintiff in that lawsuit.

      "bodyText": "More than 300 hospital staff in Bradford are to strike this week in a dispute over what union leaders have described as the \u201cback door privatisation\u201d of the NHS. Porters, cleaners and security staff voted to take industrial action over plans by Bradford teaching hospitals NHS trust to set up a new company to run the facilities. The union, Unison, said the move was part of the creeping privatisation of the NHS and would strip as many as 600 workers of the protections they have as health service employees. The seven-day strike, which began on Monday morning, comes amid mounting calls for the Conservative government to scrap legislation that has led to the widespread privatisation of healthcare. The Bradford proposals centre on its estates, facilities and clinical engineering services and do not include the privatisation of patient care. The trust has denied it is privatising services, insisting the new company will be \u201centirely owned and operated for and by the NHS\u201d. The trust\u2019s hospitals include Bradford Royal infirmary and St Luke\u2019s hospital. Unison balloted its 313 affected members when the plans were unveiled in May and 97% voted for strike action. Natalie Ratcliffe, a regional organiser for Unison, said members were angry at the proposals because they meant they would no longer be employed within the NHS. The trust said it would guarantee that affected staff kept their existing pay and conditions for 25 years \u2013 a promise Unison said its members believed could be \u201ceasily broken\u201d. Ratcliffe said: \u201cWe have urged the trust to scrap the plans, or at least shelve them, as there is likely to be a general election this year or next and the policy of establishing wholly owned subsidiaries is likely to be dropped. \u201cOther trusts in the UK have dropped or shelved their plans, but the Bradford trust seems hell-bent on imposing this company on our members and they are sufficiently angry and worried about it to have decided to go on strike.\u201d The trust said arrangements had been made to \u201censure that patient safety and levels of care\u201d were not compromised by the industrial action and that essential services, such as emergency and urgent surgery, would continue as normal. It advised patients to attend appointments as normal and added: \u201cThere will be picket lines outside the entrances to the trust\u2019s hospitals and we expect that pickets will behave in a responsible way; they will not be allowed to obstruct or intimidate patients and visitors and you will be able to gain admission to all our hospitals as normal.\u201d",

Instead, it would be struck for not meeting the \u201cserious harm\u201d threshold introduced in the Defamation Act 2013.</p> <p>The company would have to show that the statements complained about had caused or were likely to cause serious harm in the form of serious financial loss. And as Stephens says: \u201cIn the modern era, handing out around 60 leaflets outside one store wouldn\u2019t serious cause harm.\u201d</p>",

Steel remembers that at the start of the initial case they were given some basic legal advice. \u201cThat advice was \u2018don\u2019t do it \u2013 you\u2019re on a hiding to nothing\u2019, because even if we had plenty of resources, it was up to us to prove the truth of everything that was said in the leaflet,\u201d she says. That was a huge task for Steel, who did not write any of the pamphlet and was not even in the group when it was written. \u201cWhen all you are doing is handing out leaflets it\u2019s a tall order to then have to become experts,\u201d she says. \u201cThe case dominated our lives from 1993 until the verdict in 1996. It was a full-time job around the clock. When we got home from court we had to prepare for the next day. \u201cIt was exhausting, but there was an important principle at stake: wealthy companies should not be able to silence people and control what they say about their practices, which are then not subject to scrutiny.\u201d Before their case, she says, McDonald\u2019s had threatened to sue other organisations for libel, which had then all backed down and apologised. \u201cThe company created a climate of fear of a libel writ so its business practices went unchallenged, which is not healthy in a democratic society,\u201d she says. But she adds: \u201cIf I\u2019d have known then what was involved, I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019d have gone ahead.\u201d Mark Stephens, now a partner at law firm Howard Kennedy, was one of the band of lawyers who helped the pair without charge throughout the case. He says the lack of legal aid resulted in a gross inequality of arms and was also a total false economy. A case that should have lasted three weeks went on for months, preventing other cases from being heard. The case, he says, was \u201can abject lesson in how not to do it\u201d from the point of view of McDonald\u2019s. \u201cBringing the case in the early days of the internet meant that many more people came to know what was in the leaflets. The whole thing was madness.\u201d The case became the longest trial in English legal history, but according to Stephens it would not even be heard today. Instead, it would be struck for not meeting the \u201cserious harm\u201d threshold introduced in the Defamation Act 2013. The company would have to show that the statements complained about had caused or were likely to cause serious harm in the form of serious financial loss. And as Stephens says: \u201cIn the modern era, handing out around 60 leaflets outside one store wouldn\u2019t serious cause harm.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Running has been a big part of my life for many years. It has been a fix, a punishment, a distraction and a focus. In darker times, I would run at a rapid pace through the streets of New York, where I used to live, feeling the burn in my chest from too many cigarettes the night before, the thumping of my heart from too much cocaine and the sweat on my brow from too much booze. I wanted it to hurt. I wanted to hate myself, to teach myself a lesson.</p> <p>At other times I would run to try to avoid that part of myself in the first place. I clearly remember waking up on my 31st birthday, a week before I finally gave up booze, and running 20 miles so that I wouldn\u2019t have the energy or desire to get hammered again that night. It didn\u2019t work. I had to leave my own birthday party before half of my friends had even arrived because I was throwing up on my shoes. It was still light outside.</p> <p>But when times were tough, running did a pretty decent job of lifting my spirits, allowing me to think through a problem or have an hour away from gnawing guilt, panic-inducing stress or overwhelming depression. Signing up to marathons and half-marathons gave me a focus and a routine: eight weeks or so off the fags and booze while raising a few quid for charity and being a Good Person. Sure, there were weekends during the training period when I fell off the wagon spectacularly, and I would always appear at the start of the race less prepared than I wanted to be, but it kept me away from the demons that occupied my mind when I was drinking regularly, the suicidal thoughts, the niggling conviction that life was not worth living.</p> <p>Then, at the beginning of in September 2017, and now living in London, it all got too much. After a summer of sort-of training for the Loch Ness marathon and drinking myself into a dangerous state of depression, I admitted defeat. I sought help for my drinking, through a 12-step recovery programme, and ran my first marathon a few weeks later in sobriety in beautiful Inverness. It ended up being the fastest I had ever run. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m certainly not the first addict who has turned to endurance sports to get their kicks</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The fact is, I have an obsessive all-or-nothing personality, and a capacity for mental, physical and emotional pain that is not uncommon among addicts. That, combined with a love of running and the countryside, probably made my next move inevitable. I\u2019m certainly not the first addict who has turned to endurance sports to get their kicks.</p> <p>So I signed up to an ultramarathon. <a href=\"https://www.racetothetower.com/\" title=\"\">Race to the Tower</a> is a double marathon along the Cotswolds Way via slippery forest trails, up and over hills that, added together, amount to the equivalent of 7,500 feet in elevation. It\u2019s not the first time I have entered an ultramarathon which, for clarification, includes any distance over a marathon, normally 50km (31 miles) or above (a regular marathon is 42km or 26.2 miles). I have backed out of a few over the years with various excuses.</p> <p>This time I trained like my life depended on it, which, frankly, at times it did. Sixteen weeks of graft, of huge mileage, of hills, of lifting weights, of pushing my limits \u2013 I loved it. The focus, the purpose, the progression, the hours on end lapping Hampstead Heath in London. I fell in love with the mental and physical space, the weird calm that comes with knowing you have nothing to do but put one foot in front of the other until the mileage is done.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/24/tell-us-about-the-one-lifestyle-change-that-worked-for-you\">Tell us about the one lifestyle change that worked for you</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The day of the race is one I will remember for ever. The route itself was breathtakingly beautiful and the steady pace required meant that it was OK to stop and take photos; it was possible to run with a fellow runner for an hour or two, to swap life stories and speak honestly about how we were feeling, to reassure one another we were going to get through this. There was none of the jostling and elbow barging of a city marathon, none of the overwhelming clatter and clamour and crowding of the better-known races that, secretly, I have never really enjoyed.</p> <p>Around 35 miles into the race, almost seven hours after starting, something happened. I took stock of the pain and discomfort I was in and realised that it wasn\u2019t going to get much worse. I understood that if I could sit with the aches and the exhaustion and just keep moving, then I would make it. I will never forget that moment. Knowing that I could do it, that it was in me, that if I stopped fighting and started enjoying the mile I was in, then I was unstoppable.</p> <p>I completed the race in 11 hours, the 8th-fastest female across the line. But there are no numbers to explain what it means to have done it; what it took to get to the start, never mind to finish it. I realised that I am capable of more than I ever thought was possible, as long as I stay focused on the mile I am in and keep moving in the right direction, away from the way things were.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Running has been a big part of my life for many years. It has been a fix, a punishment, a distraction and a focus. In darker times, I would run at a rapid pace through the streets of New York, where I used to live, feeling the burn in my chest from too many cigarettes the night before, the thumping of my heart from too much cocaine and the sweat on my brow from too much booze. I wanted it to hurt. I wanted to hate myself, to teach myself a lesson. At other times I would run to try to avoid that part of myself in the first place. I clearly remember waking up on my 31st birthday, a week before I finally gave up booze, and running 20 miles so that I wouldn\u2019t have the energy or desire to get hammered again that night. It didn\u2019t work. I had to leave my own birthday party before half of my friends had even arrived because I was throwing up on my shoes. It was still light outside. But when times were tough, running did a pretty decent job of lifting my spirits, allowing me to think through a problem or have an hour away from gnawing guilt, panic-inducing stress or overwhelming depression. Signing up to marathons and half-marathons gave me a focus and a routine: eight weeks or so off the fags and booze while raising a few quid for charity and being a Good Person. Sure, there were weekends during the training period when I fell off the wagon spectacularly, and I would always appear at the start of the race less prepared than I wanted to be, but it kept me away from the demons that occupied my mind when I was drinking regularly, the suicidal thoughts, the niggling conviction that life was not worth living. Then, at the beginning of in September 2017, and now living in London, it all got too much. After a summer of sort-of training for the Loch Ness marathon and drinking myself into a dangerous state of depression, I admitted defeat. I sought help for my drinking, through a 12-step recovery programme, and ran my first marathon a few weeks later in sobriety in beautiful Inverness. It ended up being the fastest I had ever run. The fact is, I have an obsessive all-or-nothing personality, and a capacity for mental, physical and emotional pain that is not uncommon among addicts. That, combined with a love of running and the countryside, probably made my next move inevitable. I\u2019m certainly not the first addict who has turned to endurance sports to get their kicks. So I signed up to an ultramarathon. Race to the Tower is a double marathon along the Cotswolds Way via slippery forest trails, up and over hills that, added together, amount to the equivalent of 7,500 feet in elevation. It\u2019s not the first time I have entered an ultramarathon which, for clarification, includes any distance over a marathon, normally 50km (31 miles) or above (a regular marathon is 42km or 26.2 miles). I have backed out of a few over the years with various excuses. This time I trained like my life depended on it, which, frankly, at times it did. Sixteen weeks of graft, of huge mileage, of hills, of lifting weights, of pushing my limits \u2013 I loved it. The focus, the purpose, the progression, the hours on end lapping Hampstead Heath in London. I fell in love with the mental and physical space, the weird calm that comes with knowing you have nothing to do but put one foot in front of the other until the mileage is done. The day of the race is one I will remember for ever. The route itself was breathtakingly beautiful and the steady pace required meant that it was OK to stop and take photos; it was possible to run with a fellow runner for an hour or two, to swap life stories and speak honestly about how we were feeling, to reassure one another we were going to get through this. There was none of the jostling and elbow barging of a city marathon, none of the overwhelming clatter and clamour and crowding of the better-known races that, secretly, I have never really enjoyed. Around 35 miles into the race, almost seven hours after starting, something happened. I took stock of the pain and discomfort I was in and realised that it wasn\u2019t going to get much worse. I understood that if I could sit with the aches and the exhaustion and just keep moving, then I would make it. I will never forget that moment. Knowing that I could do it, that it was in me, that if I stopped fighting and started enjoying the mile I was in, then I was unstoppable. I completed the race in 11 hours, the 8th-fastest female across the line. But there are no numbers to explain what it means to have done it; what it took to get to the start, never mind to finish it. I realised that I am capable of more than I ever thought was possible, as long as I stay focused on the mile I am in and keep moving in the right direction, away from the way things were.",

There are three daughters, their father and mother, their children and their husbands\u2019 parents. The birth of a child called London (the capital of a foreign city, a Christian city no less, whisper appalled neighbours and relatives) is the hub from which all sorts of spokes radiate, then spin with speed and impressive control: within six pages we have been presented with an animating tragedy, and a memorable account of a woman giving birth, \u201cstanding as tall as a grand mare\u201d. Alharthi\u2019s characters are pleasingly contradictory and fallible, irreducibly individual. A doting new father brings cases of baby food for an unweaned infant, an act that is \u201cunnecessary and slightly disgraceful\u201d; a former slave locked away as \u201cmad\u201d by an embarrassed daughter calls out, whenever she hears a noise in the courtyard, \u201cI\u2019m here, I\u2019m here, I\u2019m Masoud and I\u2019m in here\u201d.</p> <p>To say that <em>Celestial Bodies</em> is a multi-generational saga simplifies what Alharthi has done, which is also to tell the story of how Oman has changed over the last century, from a traditional rural patriarchal society where Islam was complemented by Z\u0101r spirit worship, and which was among the last countries in the world to abolish slavery (in 1970), to an urban, oil-rich Gulf state. And she has done so in a form that shifts from voice to voice, viewpoint to viewpoint, decade to decade, sometimes within a single paragraph or sentence. It is no surprise that, as well as 10th-century Arabic poets such as Ab\u016b al-Tayyib Ahmad ibn Husayn al-Mutanabb\u012b, and the more recent Mahmoud Darwish, Alharthi counts among her favourite writers Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Milan Kundera, Yukio Mishima, Yasunari Kawabata and Anton Chekhov, and that the first piece of fiction she published, at 18, was a short story. She has since written three collections of stories, which have been translated into five languages, as well as children\u2019s books.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>What attracts us to literature is not that it\u2019s familiar to us, it\u2019s that we can relate to the universal value in it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><em>Celestial Bodies</em> was first published in 2010, and it has been a \u201clucky book\u201d says Alharthi, who is 40 and is in person as direct and unshowily confident as her prose. \u201cI think books are like people, some have lucky lives, and this book got a lot of attention.\u201d The critics loved it, a master\u2019s thesis has been written about it, and last year a critical study. She does almost all of our interview in fluent and authoritative English, but now she turns to Booth: \u201cI want to say this in Arabic if you don\u2019t mind, to put this in precise words \u2013 I don\u2019t want to get it wrong.\u201d \u201cSome people feel that touching upon a sensitive topic like slavery is stirring up the past in a way that isn\u2019t appropriate now,\u201d says Booth after a moment, \u201cbecause Oman is another country, and slavery is something of the past. But she\u2019s saying that that\u2019s what literature does \u2013 it\u2019s to think about the past, to think about history.\u201d</p> <p>Alharthi grew up immersed in history and especially in Arabic literature. An uncle was a poet and travel writer; her grandfather was a poet who \u201cwhen I was a child, in every situation would recite verses from Al-Mutanabb\u012b to justify his position\u201d \u2013 just as one of her characters, Azzan, does, to his beautiful Bedouin lover, who finds it increasingly alienating and irritating. Booth, who studies modern Arabic language and culture, and whose Arabic is in fact Egyptian Arabic (she has never been to Oman, and had to ask Alharthi to send her photos of typically Omani things she had not come across before), found these poems, with their double meanings and referents that stretch a thousand years into the past, by far the most challenging sections to translate. \u201cShe hated me for it!\u201d laughs Alharthi.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cf5c28ad8be898178a57d185c3521e816732d959\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf5c28ad8be898178a57d185c3521e816732d959/0_0_4114_2468/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alharthi now lives in Muscat with her husband and three children.

She teaches classical Arabic literature at Sultan Qaboos University.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Alharthi\u2019s mother was growing up in the village of Al-Qabil there was no schooling beyond basic reading and writing for anyone, male or female, unless you went to the capital, Muscat, so she taught herself poetry, reciting it as she went about her daily chores. By the time Alharthi and her siblings were born things had changed, though there still wasn\u2019t a kindergarten, so her father, who was the local governor, forged their birth certificates so they could start school early. \u201cHe thought we were too smart to sit at home.\u201d Alharthi, who now lives in Muscat and teaches classical Arabic literature at Sultan Qaboos University, is one of eight sisters and four brothers. And where do you come? \u201cOK, let me see,\u201d she counts them off on her fingers, under her breath. \u201cI think I\u2019m number four.\u201d The others have gone on to work in a wide range of jobs, from oil company employee to a brother in the foreign ministry and a sister who runs a communications company. Alharthi herself is married to a civil engineer and they have three children.</p> <p>One of the many striking things in <em>Celestial Bodies</em> is the way Alharthi refuses easy assumptions about power, and people\u2019s roles in the world. There is a moment, for instance, where she focuses on the childhood of one of the main characters, a matriarch, Salima, who started off as a poor female relative. Then she was not allowed to eat or be clothed as an equal with rich relatives, but at the same time she was not allowed to mix with the servants, to bathe like them, or dance as the slave girls do. Adult Salima cannot abide Zarifa, a former slave from her son-in-law\u2019s family, who runs the household, has the love and devotion of her supposed master and his son, and has the power in all but name. \u201cFor me it\u2019s always complicated,\u201d says Alharthi, \u201cthe relationships are complicated, and people claim their authority wherever they are. A lot of women are really strong, even though they are slaves actually, but they still can be strong.\u201d Each chapter is named after the person from whose point of view it is told, but it is interesting that the only one who speaks in the first person is a man, Abdallah \u2013 again supposedly the inheritor of riches, a businessman, the head of his household, the man in a man\u2019s world who ought to have all the power. \u201cBut Abdallah doesn\u2019t!\u201d says Alharthi, partly because of old hurts, partly because of the intensity with which he loves someone who does not love him back, partly because his world is changing so fast, partly because of the strength of the women who surround him. \u201cYou\u2019d assume that the first-person character is the one who\u2019s got some authority,\u201d adds Booth, \u201cand he\u2019s really the most vulnerable.\u201d</p> <p>How does Alharthi feel about the much wider readership this prize might give her? She is silent for a while. \u201cI don\u2019t know, it is strange \u2026 <em>yanni</em>\u201d \u2013 she turns again to Booth; English phrases pop like bubbles out of urgent Arabic. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to have a bigger readership,\u201d says Booth at last, \u201cand to have readers everywhere, but it\u2019s also a slightly strange feeling, because these are characters that came out of her mind. They developed within her own thinking and they\u2019re going out into the world and other people are reading about them and thinking about them, and it\u2019s slightly hard to let go.\u201d Or, as Salima says about her daughters: \u201cWe raise them so that strangers can take them away.\u201d There is the further point of culture, says Alharthi, which is that \u201cwhen it was published in Arabic, the Arabic audience in general and the Omani audience in particular can easily relate to the novel\u201d \u2013 and non-Arabs cannot really be expected to feel the same sense of recognition. \u201cBut I still think that what attracts us to literature is not that it\u2019s familiar to us, it\u2019s that we can relate to the universal value in it. Even if it has a very strong <em>mahaliya</em>\u201d \u2013 \u201clocalness\u201d, supplies Booth \u2013 \u201cstill I hope that international readers can relate to the universal values in it.\u201d </p> <p>\u2022 Celestial Bodies is published by Sandstone (RRP \u00a38.99).

She does almost all of our interview in fluent and authoritative English, but now she turns to Booth: \u201cI want to say this in Arabic if you don\u2019t mind, to put this in precise words \u2013 I don\u2019t want to get it wrong.\u201d \u201cSome people feel that touching upon a sensitive topic like slavery is stirring up the past in a way that isn\u2019t appropriate now,\u201d says Booth after a moment, \u201cbecause Oman is another country, and slavery is something of the past. But she\u2019s saying that that\u2019s what literature does \u2013 it\u2019s to think about the past, to think about history.\u201d Alharthi grew up immersed in history and especially in Arabic literature. An uncle was a poet and travel writer; her grandfather was a poet who \u201cwhen I was a child, in every situation would recite verses from Al-Mutanabb\u012b to justify his position\u201d \u2013 just as one of her characters, Azzan, does, to his beautiful Bedouin lover, who finds it increasingly alienating and irritating. Booth, who studies modern Arabic language and culture, and whose Arabic is in fact Egyptian Arabic (she has never been to Oman, and had to ask Alharthi to send her photos of typically Omani things she had not come across before), found these poems, with their double meanings and referents that stretch a thousand years into the past, by far the most challenging sections to translate. \u201cShe hated me for it!\u201d laughs Alharthi. When Alharthi\u2019s mother was growing up in the village of Al-Qabil there was no schooling beyond basic reading and writing for anyone, male or female, unless you went to the capital, Muscat, so she taught herself poetry, reciting it as she went about her daily chores. By the time Alharthi and her siblings were born things had changed, though there still wasn\u2019t a kindergarten, so her father, who was the local governor, forged their birth certificates so they could start school early. \u201cHe thought we were too smart to sit at home.\u201d Alharthi, who now lives in Muscat and teaches classical Arabic literature at Sultan Qaboos University, is one of eight sisters and four brothers. And where do you come? \u201cOK, let me see,\u201d she counts them off on her fingers, under her breath. \u201cI think I\u2019m number four.\u201d The others have gone on to work in a wide range of jobs, from oil company employee to a brother in the foreign ministry and a sister who runs a communications company. Alharthi herself is married to a civil engineer and they have three children. One of the many striking things in Celestial Bodies is the way Alharthi refuses easy assumptions about power, and people\u2019s roles in the world. There is a moment, for instance, where she focuses on the childhood of one of the main characters, a matriarch, Salima, who started off as a poor female relative. Then she was not allowed to eat or be clothed as an equal with rich relatives, but at the same time she was not allowed to mix with the servants, to bathe like them, or dance as the slave girls do. Adult Salima cannot abide Zarifa, a former slave from her son-in-law\u2019s family, who runs the household, has the love and devotion of her supposed master and his son, and has the power in all but name. \u201cFor me it\u2019s always complicated,\u201d says Alharthi, \u201cthe relationships are complicated, and people claim their authority wherever they are. A lot of women are really strong, even though they are slaves actually, but they still can be strong.\u201d Each chapter is named after the person from whose point of view it is told, but it is interesting that the only one who speaks in the first person is a man, Abdallah \u2013 again supposedly the inheritor of riches, a businessman, the head of his household, the man in a man\u2019s world who ought to have all the power. \u201cBut Abdallah doesn\u2019t!\u201d says Alharthi, partly because of old hurts, partly because of the intensity with which he loves someone who does not love him back, partly because his world is changing so fast, partly because of the strength of the women who surround him. \u201cYou\u2019d assume that the first-person character is the one who\u2019s got some authority,\u201d adds Booth, \u201cand he\u2019s really the most vulnerable.\u201d How does Alharthi feel about the much wider readership this prize might give her? She is silent for a while. \u201cI don\u2019t know, it is strange \u2026 yanni\u201d \u2013 she turns again to Booth; English phrases pop like bubbles out of urgent Arabic. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to have a bigger readership,\u201d says Booth at last, \u201cand to have readers everywhere, but it\u2019s also a slightly strange feeling, because these are characters that came out of her mind. They developed within her own thinking and they\u2019re going out into the world and other people are reading about them and thinking about them, and it\u2019s slightly hard to let go.\u201d Or, as Salima says about her daughters: \u201cWe raise them so that strangers can take them away.\u201d There is the further point of culture, says Alharthi, which is that \u201cwhen it was published in Arabic, the Arabic audience in general and the Omani audience in particular can easily relate to the novel\u201d \u2013 and non-Arabs cannot really be expected to feel the same sense of recognition. \u201cBut I still think that what attracts us to literature is not that it\u2019s familiar to us, it\u2019s that we can relate to the universal value in it. Even if it has a very strong mahaliya\u201d \u2013 \u201clocalness\u201d, supplies Booth \u2013 \u201cstill I hope that international readers can relate to the universal values in it.\u201d \u2022 Celestial Bodies is published by Sandstone (RRP \u00a38.99).

      "bodyText": "Actor John Jarratt, who was cleared of historic rape charges on Friday, is suing the Daily Telegraph and journalist Jonathan Moran for defamation. Jarratt, 66, was found not guilty of raping his housemate more than 40 years ago in a share house he lived in with his wife Rosa Miano. The star of Wolf Creek testified that the sex with his housemate was consensual and denied he had held her down or ripped her clothes off. \u201cNo man should have to go through what I have gone through,\u201d Jarratt told reporters outside court as he hugged Miano. One of Jarratt\u2019s lawyers, Chris Murphy, revealed on Monday that the defamation proceedings he had filed in the NSW supreme court last year would proceed now the criminal matter had been resolved. \u201cThe civil statement of claim was filed pending resolution of police charges,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cDocuments will now be served on the defendant.\u201d The defendant is Nationwide News, publisher of the Telegraph. Jarratt is suing over the News Corp tabloid\u2019s front-page story in 2017 headlined \u201cWolf Creek star in rape claim\u201d. Jarratt told the NSW district court that the first he heard of any rape allegation was when his agent rang him in November 2017 to tell him there was going to be a newspaper story. Earlier this year the federal court ruled that the Daily Telegraph and Moran had defamed another well-known actor, Geoffrey Rush, by alleging he \u201cengaged in inappropriate behaviour\u201d towards the actor Eryn Jean Norvill during a theatre production of King Lear. That front-page story, published under the headline \u201cKing Leer\u201d in November 2017, reported the Sydney Theatre Company had received the anonymous complaint but provided no further details. The Daily Telegraph is appealing against the record $2.9m judgment. It is the largest ever defamation payout to a single person in Australia after the Victorian court of appeal last year slashed the actor Rebel Wilson\u2019s damages payout from $4.5m to $600,000 over defamatory articles in Woman\u2019s Day magazine. Jarratt has always maintained his innocence. John Jarratt v Nationwide News is set down for mention on 18 August.",

      "body": "<p><strong>I was released from prison last year </strong><strong>at the age of 46 after serving 28 years. </strong><strong>I was a virgin when I went to prison and I</strong><strong> am still a virgin. My whole adult life I have </strong><strong>masturbated</strong><strong> \u2013 sometimes once a week, sometimes </strong><strong>seven times a week. I\u2019ve seen plenty of pornography (magazines </strong><strong>and movies) and </strong><strong>used these things at times when I masturbated. I have never had a problem</strong><strong> getting an erection when I </strong><strong>masturbate</strong><strong>.</strong></p> <p><strong>Since my release, I</strong><strong> have met </strong><strong>two women. When it </strong><strong>was time for sex with the </strong><strong>first</strong><strong>, I could not get an erection. She tried using </strong><strong>her hand and she tried oral sex. Neither worked; </strong><strong>it actually felt weird</strong><strong>, I guess </strong><strong>because only my hand had ever touched my penis. That relationship ended. The </strong><strong>second woman I</strong><strong> have been seeing for months. </strong><strong>She knows of my time in prison and that I</strong><strong> am a virgin. When she told me I could go all the way with her, I couldn\u2019t get it up. She was understanding and said it will happen in time</strong><strong>, but that did not console me. I</strong><strong> am </strong><strong>convinced that almost 35 years of </strong><strong>masturbating has ruined me.</strong></p> <p><strong>I love her and we</strong><strong> will try again one day. When we do and I fail again, I will have to let her go so she can find a man who can satisfy her in that way. I have waited my whole life to lose my virginity</strong><strong>. </strong><strong>Maybe I need Viagra or some other drug. </strong><strong>I</strong><strong> had figured that the only problem I would have would be achieving orgasm. </strong><strong>I am depressed and scared at the same time. I </strong><strong>don\u2019t know what to do.</strong></p> <p>I am sorry that you have become so anxious about your ability to achieve and maintain an erection. But there is no need to be so concerned. It is very unlikely that masturbation has had a detrimental effect on your erectile ability. In fact, it was a good way to sustain your sexual functioning over so many years in prison. The ability to be sexual with a partner is something everyone has to learn; as your recent partner suggested, it will just take a little time. Bridging between sex alone and sex with someone else will require you to relax and let go of your goals to \u201cperform\u201d or even to achieve erection. Instead, try to focus simply on giving and receiving pleasure. You will also need the ability to listen to your partner\u2019s needs and an ability to share your needs with her. And there is nothing wrong with seeking pharmacological help with erectile functioning \u2013 at least at first. Most importantly, I understand why pornography may have been the main source of your sex education, but what you learned is not necessarily correct or helpful, because everyone is different. Be patient with yourself.

      "bodyText": "I was released from prison last year at the age of 46 after serving 28 years. I was a virgin when I went to prison and I am still a virgin. My whole adult life I have masturbated \u2013 sometimes once a week, sometimes seven times a week. I\u2019ve seen plenty of pornography (magazines and movies) and used these things at times when I masturbated. I have never had a problem getting an erection when I masturbate. Since my release, I have met two women. When it was time for sex with the first, I could not get an erection. She tried using her hand and she tried oral sex. Neither worked; it actually felt weird, I guess because only my hand had ever touched my penis. That relationship ended. The second woman I have been seeing for months. She knows of my time in prison and that I am a virgin. When she told me I could go all the way with her, I couldn\u2019t get it up. She was understanding and said it will happen in time, but that did not console me. I am convinced that almost 35 years of masturbating has ruined me. I love her and we will try again one day. When we do and I fail again, I will have to let her go so she can find a man who can satisfy her in that way. I have waited my whole life to lose my virginity. Maybe I need Viagra or some other drug. I had figured that the only problem I would have would be achieving orgasm. I am depressed and scared at the same time. I don\u2019t know what to do. I am sorry that you have become so anxious about your ability to achieve and maintain an erection. But there is no need to be so concerned. It is very unlikely that masturbation has had a detrimental effect on your erectile ability. In fact, it was a good way to sustain your sexual functioning over so many years in prison. The ability to be sexual with a partner is something everyone has to learn; as your recent partner suggested, it will just take a little time. Bridging between sex alone and sex with someone else will require you to relax and let go of your goals to \u201cperform\u201d or even to achieve erection. Instead, try to focus simply on giving and receiving pleasure. You will also need the ability to listen to your partner\u2019s needs and an ability to share your needs with her. And there is nothing wrong with seeking pharmacological help with erectile functioning \u2013 at least at first. Most importantly, I understand why pornography may have been the main source of your sex education, but what you learned is not necessarily correct or helpful, because everyone is different. Be patient with yourself. You are about to enter a new phase in the natural process of sexual development that everyone undergoes throughout their life. \u2022Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders. \u2022 If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don\u2019t send attachments).

And maybe the players were distracted by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/08/usa-womens-team-sues-us-soccer-pay-equality\">the dispute over equal pay</a> with their bosses at the US Soccer Federation.</p> \n<p>Indeed, by the time the US arrived in France, that dispute had reached fever pitch. Every player on the team has sued US Soccer in federal court \u2013 the case will be heard in the coming weeks \u2013 and, for many, the topic became a sort of Rorschach test about feminism and equality. The players, who had to file their lawsuit before the World Cup began, were getting dragged into divisive and potentially distracting conversations. They didn\u2019t need to win the World Cup to secure equal pay (and nor should they) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/22/uswnt-world-cup-gender-discrimination-case\">but it sure as hell would help</a>.</p> \n<p>Even the President of the United States <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/26/donald-trump-megan-rapinoe-womens-world-cup-soccer-white-house-visit\">seemed to have a problem</a> with the anointed \u201cbad guys\u201d of the Women\u2019s World Cup. Donald Trump didn\u2019t like that Megan Rapinoe had said she would not attend the White House if the team won the tournament, and suddenly everyone on the team had to decide whether they would defy Trump and the more toxic parts of his fanbase. Suddenly, this was a team that \u2013 fairly or unfairly \u2013 represented a lot more than the hopes of just soccer fans.</p> \n<p>And then there were the worries on the pitch: Hope Solo, arguably the greatest goalkeeper the women\u2019s game has ever seen, was no longer on the team, and the untested Alyssa Naeher looked error prone. The back line in front of her had been built to be ultra-attacking and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/27/womens-world-cup-2019-uswnt-defending-champions\">looked vulnerable to quick counterattacks</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8ed7e641-d1c0-48e8-bb83-56c20ca9d7b1\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Megan Rapinoe</b>'s goal from the penalty spot in the final gave her the Golden Boot ahead of USA teammate <b>Alex Morgan</b>.

Sure, Naeher made a couple mistakes, but there weren\u2019t costly \u2013 the US still steamrolled through the group stage without conceding a single goal. They dropped <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/11/usa-thailand-uswnt-womens-world-cup-soccer-match-report\">13 goals on Thailand</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/16/usa-chile-womens-world-cup-match-report\">three on Chile</a> and another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/20/usa-pass-sweden-test-to-seal-top-spot-in-group-as-spain-await-in-last-16\">two on Sweden</a>, setting scoring records along the way.</p> \n<p>That wasn\u2019t enough though. Pundits, anxious US fans and opponents still looked for reasons why the US would eventually lose.

      "bodyText": "There were plenty of reasons to expect the US wouldn\u2019t repeat as Women\u2019s World Cup champions. Most teams only need to beat their opponents. For the Americans, meanwhile, it often seemed like they had to accomplish that task while taking on their president as well as social inequality. Yes, the US were used to pressure. They had won the World Cup in 2015, but clinching back-to-back World Cups is exceedingly rare \u2013 it had only happened once on the women\u2019s side and twice on the men\u2019s. It\u2019s far too easy for complacency creep in \u2014 just look at how Germany stumbled in the men\u2019s World Cup last year after winning in 2014. And it\u2019s not as if it had been smooth-sailing for the Americans since they won in 2015. With veterans like Abby Wambach retiring, the look of the team changed, and then the Americans suffered a humiliating and early exit at the 2016 Olympics. The US, despite their history of dominance, just didn\u2019t look as imposing as they once had. Maybe the rest of the world had caught up. Maybe Jill Ellis wasn\u2019t a good coach. Maybe the squad \u2013 the oldest in the tournament \u2013 was past it. And maybe the players were distracted by the dispute over equal pay with their bosses at the US Soccer Federation. Indeed, by the time the US arrived in France, that dispute had reached fever pitch. Every player on the team has sued US Soccer in federal court \u2013 the case will be heard in the coming weeks \u2013 and, for many, the topic became a sort of Rorschach test about feminism and equality. The players, who had to file their lawsuit before the World Cup began, were getting dragged into divisive and potentially distracting conversations. They didn\u2019t need to win the World Cup to secure equal pay (and nor should they) but it sure as hell would help. Even the President of the United States seemed to have a problem with the anointed \u201cbad guys\u201d of the Women\u2019s World Cup. Donald Trump didn\u2019t like that Megan Rapinoe had said she would not attend the White House if the team won the tournament, and suddenly everyone on the team had to decide whether they would defy Trump and the more toxic parts of his fanbase. Suddenly, this was a team that \u2013 fairly or unfairly \u2013 represented a lot more than the hopes of just soccer fans. And then there were the worries on the pitch: Hope Solo, arguably the greatest goalkeeper the women\u2019s game has ever seen, was no longer on the team, and the untested Alyssa Naeher looked error prone. The back line in front of her had been built to be ultra-attacking and looked vulnerable to quick counterattacks. Once the games started, however, those vulnerabilities didn\u2019t seem so glaring. Sure, Naeher made a couple mistakes, but there weren\u2019t costly \u2013 the US still steamrolled through the group stage without conceding a single goal. They dropped 13 goals on Thailand, three on Chile and another two on Sweden, setting scoring records along the way. That wasn\u2019t enough though. Pundits, anxious US fans and opponents still looked for reasons why the US would eventually lose. Maybe USA\u2019s opponents in the group stage hadn\u2019t been enough of a test, or in Sweden\u2019s case, with a second-string team, maybe they didn\u2019t try hard enough. And yes, the Americans had looked utterly dominant against Thailand \u2013 but to some they also looked arrogant too.

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.</p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europeif there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Rycroft\u2019s warning came as Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, said it would be a <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/editorial/simon-coveney-chances-of-a-disorderly-brexit-have-never-been-higher-1.3949549\">\u201cserious error\u201d</a> to assume no deal would not happen.</p> \n<p>One of the biggest dangers Ireland faces, he said, was \u201cthe boy who cried wolf effect, whereby people and business assume that because a disorderly Brexit was averted in March and April the same will happen in October\u201d.

I had intended to involve you closely in the planning over the next few months, but issuing a press release straight after meeting like that makes it much more difficult for me to do that.\u201d Burnett said he felt Grayling was \u201ctrying to silence an industry that\u2019s trying to help government, guide them\u201d. He added: \u201cMy sense of that message was \u2013 either shut up or you don\u2019t engage.\u201d A Department for Transport spokesman said it continued to work with the RHA but it was \u201cextremely unfortunate when details of private conversations held in confidence are made public in a press release\u201d. The Irish cabinet will meet on Tuesday to discuss ramping up no-deal planning again with questions expected on how it could avoid infrastructure on the border while protecting the EU\u2019s single market.",

Visitors are accustomed to warnings to cover up their body ink while they are in Japan, where tattoos are traditionally associated with membership of yakuza crime syndicates. But the expectation that a large number of visiting fans with tattoos will want to soak in the restorative waters of Japan\u2019s thousands of hot springs has led some operators to relax their restrictions. Tourism officials near Sapporo, which will host England v Tonga, said they would leave individual onsen owners to decide whether to admit tattooed bathers, according to the Kyodo news agency. The famous onsen resort of Atami, near the Fukuroi venue for Ireland\u2019s match against hosts Japan, has taken a similar approach. \u201cWith the Olympics coming up as well, we feel the need to discuss the issue of tattoos,\u201d an Itami official told Kyodo. Oita prefecture, region of south-west Japan famed for its hot springs, appears more willing to embrace tattooed customers, publishing English-language guidelines on onsen etiquette and an online map of dozens of facilities in the onsen towns of Beppu and Yufuin that will accept tattooed bathers during the six-week tournament, which opens on 20 September.

A 2015 survey by the Japan Tourism Agency found that around 60% of onsen operators banned people with tattoos. Last September, World Rugby, the global game\u2019s governing body, warned players and supporters to keep their tattoos covered when visiting gyms and pools to avoid causing offence. The All Blacks, who have a huge following in Japan, are among the teams that have said they will comply. Tattooed or not, first-time onsen users are being encouraged to follow a few simple rules to ensure their Japanese communal bathing experience is memorable for the right reasons.

      "bodyText": "The anti-encryption laws passed by the federal parliament last year have been used to bypass journalist protections in other national security laws, a cybersecurity researcher has said. The parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security has launched a review into the Telecommunications (Assistance and Access) Act, which passed into law at the end of 2018. The legislation made a number of changes to existing laws governing law enforcement access to data, and in what situations tech companies are required to help law enforcement to be able to view that data, even if that data is encrypted. One part of the law updated the powers law enforcement have in executing a warrant. Added into the Crimes Act was the power for agencies to \u201cadd, copy, delete or alter\u201d data on computers as part of the execution of warrants. It was this new power the Australian federal police relied on, in the now-infamous photos of AFP officers clicking through and reviewing files for hours on end at the ABC headquarters. The Department of Home Affairs admitted to using the new power in a submission to the review, stating the AFP relied on the power in raiding the ABC and the Canberra home of News Corp journalist Annika Smethurst in June. \u201cIn June 2019, the Australian federal police executed two search warrants in relation to secrecy offences in part 6 (offences by and against public officers) and part 7 (official secrets and unlawful soundings) of the Crimes Act,\u201d the Department of Home Affairs stated. \u201cIn executing these search warrants, the AFP used section 3F of the Crimes Act, which was amended by schedule 3 of the Assistance and Access Act.\u201d This undermined protections granted to journalists under other national security legislation, said cybersecurity researcher Riana Pfefferkorn, an associate director of surveillance and cybersecurity at the Stanford Centre for Internet and Society. Data retention legislation passed in 2015 had a carve-out for journalists that required law enforcement to obtain a special journalist information warrant, but Pfefferkorn said in a personal submission to the review that the combination of the new powers meant the information warrant need not be obtained. \u201cLaw enforcement\u2019s powers granted under the Data Retention Act in 2015 were augmented by the new powers the Assistance and Access Act provided at the end of 2018, creating the framework that authorised the federal police in mid-2019 to raid the homes and offices of journalists over articles published in July 2017 and April 2018, in defiance of international norms,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause parliament passed these laws, the federal police had the power to strike a chilling blow against press freedom in Australia, and call it lawful.\u201d Tech companies remain concerned at the implementation of the encryption law overall. The Australian Information Industry Association, which represents a wide range of tech companies including Apple, Adobe, Cisco, Deloitte, Google and IBM, said that some multinational members of the association had already considered pulling out of Australia due to the legislative compliance obligations. \u201cThere is broad consensus across the ICT industry on the adverse effects this legislation will have for Australian business and economic interests, the group said. The commonwealth ombudsman, too, repeated concerns about the scope of the new laws. In a submission, the ombudsman said that the law still gives the home affairs minister the power to delete content from reports by the commonwealth ombudsman if the information could prejudice an investigation or compromise an interception agency\u2019s operational activities. This is a power no other minister has, the ombudsman said, and should be reconsidered.",

      "body": "<p>It was 1.30 in the morning in Melbourne and Adrian McKinty had just got home after dropping off his last Uber customer of the night at the airport. His phone rang. It was Shane Salerno, agent to authors including Don Winslow, and it was a call that would pull McKinty into \u201csome major league craziness\u201d, ending in <a href=\"https://www.thebookseller.com/news/six-figure-deal-mckinty-s-chain-998316\">a six-figure English-language book deal</a> and, last week,<a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/06/the-chain-uber-driver-adrian-mckinty-paramount-pictures-1202634191/\"> a seven-figure film deal from Paramount</a> for his forthcoming novel The Chain.</p> <p>\u201cDon told me you\u2019ve given up writing,\u201d said Salerno. McKinty, an award-winning crime novelist, had recently blogged about his decision to quit being an author. Beginning with his debut, Dead I May Well Be, written while he taught high school English in Colorado, and continuing with his award-winning series about Northern Irish detective Sean Duffy, McKinty\u2019s books might have won him prizes and great reviews, but they weren\u2019t making him any money. The family moved from the US to Australia in 2008 because McKinty\u2019s wife, author and academic Leah Garrett, was offered a job there. Now the family had been evicted from the home they\u2019d had lived in for eight years, and he was working as an Uber a cab driver (\u201cthe world\u2019s worst,\u201d he says now) and bartending in an attempt to actually bring in some cash.</p> <p>Now Salerno \u2013 a man he\u2019d never spoken to before \u2013 was quizzing him in the early hours about his decision and his books. McKinty told him about his series of Belfast-set crime novels, and Salerno asked if he had ever thought about writing one in America.</p> <p>As it turned out, McKinty had. In Mexico City five years earlier, while trying to write a novel about Trotsky (\u201cit was a big fiasco, it was going nowhere\u201d), McKinty learned about exchange killings: where a person offers to swap themselves for a kidnapped family member while a ransom is raised. He\u2019d combined this with the idea of chain letters \u2013 he\u2019d grown up in the 70s and 80s in Carrickfergus, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland\">Northern Ireland</a>, \u201cwhere we used to get these bloody horrible chain letters; we all believed it\u201d. These were the seeds for The Chain, in which a mother is told her daughter has been kidnapped, and that the only way to get her back is to kidnap another child. And so on, down the chain.</p> <p>Write it, said Salerno. \u201cMaybe in a couple of years, when I\u2019ve got my finances sorted out,\u201d agreed McKinty. \u201cWhat if I wired you $10,000 into your bank account tonight?\u201d Salerno offered. McKinty said he\u2019d think about it; Salerno said no, go and write it now.</p> <p>At around three in the morning, McKinty gave it a go, writing the first 30 pages of what would become The Chain, sent it off and went to bed.

Starting with Rachel\u2019s discovery that her daughter Kylie has been kidnapped, then following her attempts to drum up the ransom and find someone else to kidnap, it is a brutal, breathless race to the finish which forces the reader to ask, again and again: what would I do, in that situation?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>When they were evicted from their home, 'I was thinking to myself, \"Oh God Adrian, what have you done with your life?\"'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI wanted to take a person who breaks all these codes of morals \u2013 in every conceivable code of moral philosophy, she does the wrong thing,\u201d says McKinty, who studied philosophy at Oxford. \u201cIn terms of Kantian ethics it\u2019s the wrong thing; in terms of utilitarian ethics it\u2019s the wrong thing; in terms of Aristotelian ethics it\u2019s the wrong thing.

      "bodyText": "It was 1.30 in the morning in Melbourne and Adrian McKinty had just got home after dropping off his last Uber customer of the night at the airport. His phone rang. It was Shane Salerno, agent to authors including Don Winslow, and it was a call that would pull McKinty into \u201csome major league craziness\u201d, ending in a six-figure English-language book deal and, last week, a seven-figure film deal from Paramount for his forthcoming novel The Chain. \u201cDon told me you\u2019ve given up writing,\u201d said Salerno. McKinty, an award-winning crime novelist, had recently blogged about his decision to quit being an author. Beginning with his debut, Dead I May Well Be, written while he taught high school English in Colorado, and continuing with his award-winning series about Northern Irish detective Sean Duffy, McKinty\u2019s books might have won him prizes and great reviews, but they weren\u2019t making him any money. The family moved from the US to Australia in 2008 because McKinty\u2019s wife, author and academic Leah Garrett, was offered a job there. Now the family had been evicted from the home they\u2019d had lived in for eight years, and he was working as an Uber a cab driver (\u201cthe world\u2019s worst,\u201d he says now) and bartending in an attempt to actually bring in some cash. Now Salerno \u2013 a man he\u2019d never spoken to before \u2013 was quizzing him in the early hours about his decision and his books. McKinty told him about his series of Belfast-set crime novels, and Salerno asked if he had ever thought about writing one in America. As it turned out, McKinty had. In Mexico City five years earlier, while trying to write a novel about Trotsky (\u201cit was a big fiasco, it was going nowhere\u201d), McKinty learned about exchange killings: where a person offers to swap themselves for a kidnapped family member while a ransom is raised. He\u2019d combined this with the idea of chain letters \u2013 he\u2019d grown up in the 70s and 80s in Carrickfergus, Northern Ireland, \u201cwhere we used to get these bloody horrible chain letters; we all believed it\u201d. These were the seeds for The Chain, in which a mother is told her daughter has been kidnapped, and that the only way to get her back is to kidnap another child. And so on, down the chain. Write it, said Salerno. \u201cMaybe in a couple of years, when I\u2019ve got my finances sorted out,\u201d agreed McKinty. \u201cWhat if I wired you $10,000 into your bank account tonight?\u201d Salerno offered. McKinty said he\u2019d think about it; Salerno said no, go and write it now. At around three in the morning, McKinty gave it a go, writing the first 30 pages of what would become The Chain, sent it off and went to bed. His phone rang again at 4.15. \u201cForget bartending.

Each time she\u2019s been sent away in despair. Makuvise\u2019s application, like others submitted a year ago, is stuck in a huge passport backlog. Zimbabwe\u2019s passport office has seen an influx of applications as economic woes push more people to search for work in other countries. Inflation in Zimbabwe has hit a 10-year record of close to 100%, the second highest rate in the world after Venezuela. The registry office can only process 50 passports a day. It has bemoaned the lack of foreign currency available to import paper and is now faced with a backlog of 280,000 applications. The Zimbabwe human rights commission has begun inquiries into the delay of passports and national identification documents following a public outcry. Makuvise and her friend, Moreen, 30, have resorted to taking turns sleeping in the queue to better their chances of being served the following day. Makuvise\u2019s hopes of working in South Africa are slowly fading. \u201cAfter waiting close to a year, I decided to come here daily. They often tell us that there is no material for the passports and keep on postponing the collection date. It\u2019s getting frustrating. I get ZWD 80 [17p] per month and it\u2019s not enough. I need a better job so that passport is the only way out of here,\u201d Makuvise tells the Guardian. Millions of Zimbabweans left the country over the past two decades of economic mismanagement by longtime leader Robert Mugabe.Things have not improved under President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who took power in a military coup in 2017. Mnangagwa, who promised a \u201cnew dispensation\u201d, ran into challenges in his first year in office. The possibility of getting a bailout loan from international financial institutions remains a distant dream because of human rights violations. The return of the Zimbabwean dollar is expected to worsen the economic situation as it remains weaker against other currencies, including the US dollar. Applicants in need of medical attention abroad have also borne the brunt of passport challenges in Zimbabwe. Cleopatra Arufandika, 45, is due a major operation in India in the next month, after suffering a hip dislocation. Accompanied by her son, Marlvin, she hoped her predicament would persuade the authorities to fast-track her application. But Arufandika was turned away. \u201cI am in pain and my hospital booking is in a month. My family have already spent a lot of money on treatment. All I want is to get better,\u201d Arufandika says. Arufandika has been pleading with the authorities and hopes for a better response at her next appointment. The passport situation has also dashed the hopes of students wishing to study abroad. Taurai Dyanda, 18, who was due to start at university in China in May, has called on the government to expedite travel documents for students. \u201cI applied for my passport in September last year ,but almost a year later nothing has come. I have already missed the May intake and I\u2019m forced to plead with my sponsors,\u201d Dyanda says. \u201cI won a scholarship to study civil engineering and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for young people to lose opportunities like these.\u201d Hopes are also fading for Thelma Ndebele, 22, a prospective medical student. \u201cI should have gone to school in February and I have been turned away from the passport office for the fourth time. Now they want me to give an extra ZWD 53 to improve my chances of getting the passport, which cannot be guaranteed. I cannot continue to stay here while my friends are studying,\u201d Ndebele says. The government this week admitted that they are facing a backlog dating back to July 2018. Home affairs minister Cain Mathema has promised to improve the process within a month. He says the Treasury has purchased new machines to print travel documents at a cost of nearly $600,000 (\u00a3480,000). \u201cWe can promise that within the next four to five weeks we\u2019ll be able to produce 3,000 passports a day. The president had to intervene. Our ultimate goal is to produce at least 8,000 a day,\u201d says Mathema.

      "body": "<p>The Bose Frames are the answer to the question: what if your sunglasses were also a set of smart, hidden headphones with no earbuds or no bone-conduction system, just a set of personal speakers?</p> <p>As a wearer of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/01/best-true-wireless-earbuds-airpods-samsung-jabra-sennheiser-anker-compared-and-ranked\">true wireless earbuds</a>, that\u2019s not a question I ever thought I would ask. But the Bose Frames are delightful and leaving your ears free of buds or headphones has a clear and obvious case.</p> <p>The term \u201csmart glasses\u201d\u2019 might conjure up visions of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google-glass\">Google\u2019s ill-fated Glass</a>, but the Bose Frames are not in the same league. There\u2019s no screen, camera or any visible signs of \u201csmart\u201d from the front. Instead they have built-in sensors and a pair of hidden speakers, which pipe music to your ears.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0bb45b1ef46396f84f60f027ed3e9af7c470fd12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0bb45b1ef46396f84f60f027ed3e9af7c470fd12/234_530_4171_2504/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bose Frames review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Frames look like regular sunglasses with slightly thicker arms towards the ears \u2013 no camera or large lump up front to mark them out as smart glasses.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bose has nailed the design of the Frames. They look like regular unisex sunglasses. Granted, the arms are a bit thicker and wider near the ears, where traditional sunglasses would taper, and there\u2019s a small gold button for turning them on and controlling music. But I was happy wearing them when not listening to music.</p> <p>There\u2019s a choice of two frames: the larger, squarer Alto (as tested) and the smaller, rounder Rondo. Both are made from black nylon, come with black lenses and look fairly generic.</p> <p>Other lenses are available as optional accessories, including a set of mirrored polarised (<a href=\"https://www.bose.co.uk/en_gb/products/headphones/headphone_accessories/bose-lens-alto.html#v=bose_lens_alto_silver_row\">\u00a330</a>) or blue gradient (<a href=\"https://www.bose.co.uk/en_gb/products/headphones/headphone_accessories/bose-lens-alto.html#v=bose_lens_alto_blue_row\">\u00a320</a>), which pop in and out easily enough with a bit of light force applied to the lens. But that\u2019s about as far as customisation goes. Prescription lenses are coming, but aren\u2019t available in the UK yet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a02296c26d59fe36943221f65bab591351f2781\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a02296c26d59fe36943221f65bab591351f2781/312_271_4616_2771/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bose Frames review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bose sells replacement lenses that users pop in and out themselves in a matter of seconds, no tools required.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They\u2019re comfortable to wear for extended periods without pinching on the nose or ears, and fold up just like any regular set. They weigh 45g, which is about the weight of a thicker set of premium sunglasses.</p> <p>If I was to nitpick I would say that the black frames look a little cheap and almost too generic. But the fact that\u2019s even worth mentioning is testament to how not like other smart glasses the Frames are.</p> <h2>How they work and sound</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0179e0b439bfc7aa0cb8981a4ea37d7c3181bc7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0179e0b439bfc7aa0cb8981a4ea37d7c3181bc7a/308_269_4437_2663/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bose Frames review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The sound is piped to your ears through the speaker grille at the end of the thick bit of the arms.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The glasses sound amazingly good for what they are. Two small speakers sit in the frame just in front of your ears. The music is directed straight to your ear through small speaker grilles, while cancelling sound is projected out into the world. The result is a sound leakage of about 1%, according to Bose.</p> <p>In the real world if you have the volume below 50% people sitting right next to you won\u2019t hear it. In fact I took delight in the look of surprise on people\u2019s faces when I gave them the Frames and they suddenly heard my tunes blasting out as they put them on. It\u2019s really very impressive.</p> <p>In terms of raw sound quality, the Frames sound like a very open set of quality earbuds. They lack deep bass, but give them something complex and they shine with energy and warmth, with excellent separation and clarity.</p> <p>Crank them up beyond 85% volume and you start to hear distortion, but they pretty loud by that point. Most of my listening was about at 60% on the street or about 30% in quieter spots.</p> <p>The one thing the Frames can\u2019t do that earbuds can is protect you from the loud din of a city. You can forget hearing music on a screeching train or while walking by a working jackhammer. In this regard they are very much like Apple\u2019s popular AirPods.</p> <h2>Controls and connectivity</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"137ebb7b7f6cda73714da35fd8cedb40b45d67af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/137ebb7b7f6cda73714da35fd8cedb40b45d67af/227_264_4590_2755/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bose Frames review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A single button under the arm takes care of power and play controls.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Frames support standard Bluetooth audio (SBC) as well as the higher quality AAC audio, and had rock-solid connectivity with both Android phones and the iPhone. No noticeable lipsync issues were present either, which made the Frames great for watching video.</p> <p>The microphone was surprisingly good, picking up my voice clearly for the other end of the call (or Google Assistant/Siri). Be warned though: with no earbuds visible people think you\u2019re talking to yourself.</p> <p>Turning on the Frames is as easy as pressing the single discreet button under the right arm. The button also serves for pause/play or accepting a call. Double press to skip forward, triple for back. Anyone who has used wireless earbuds before will be familiar with this.</p> <p>To switch them off just turn them upside down for a second or so. It all works great. The one thing they\u2019re missing is volume control, so you\u2019ll be reaching for your phone for that, which is a shame.</p> <h2>Battery life</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b6209766725418f311dc3bec9d2bfd2a4f75175\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b6209766725418f311dc3bec9d2bfd2a4f75175/0_0_4928_2958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bose Frames review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The charging cable clips in place with little effort thanks to some fairly strong magnets.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You get just over three hours of continuous listening out of the Frames before the battery runs dry, which is normally enough. Charging is fairly slow and needs a proprietary magnetic USB cable that snaps on to the inside of the right arm.</p> <p>The Frames come with a traditional sunglasses case, which is a missed opportunity. Most true wireless earbuds last about three hours, but are charged multiple times by their case. The Frames could really do with a battery in the case. It\u2019s too easy to forget to charge them, turning them into standard sunglasses.</p> <h2>Bose AR</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c07cac02cf0ff7edacfa7a2f2a6a8ab340703aef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c07cac02cf0ff7edacfa7a2f2a6a8ab340703aef/316_607_4211_2528/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bose Frames review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sensors are hidden in the frames that can detect your head position and interactions such as taps to the side of the glasses.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The smart bit of the Frames is support for the firm\u2019s audio augmented reality platform, Bose AR, which is also available on the Bose\u2019s popular QC35 II headphones, and on the upcoming Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700.</p> <p>The Frames know which way you\u2019re facing and your location from the GPS on your phone, so you can use audio to feed information about the real world into your ears.</p> <p>But the platform only supports iOS at the moment and lacks a killer app. The best of the bunch are some 3D audio experiences, a golf app that can tell you where the hole is and some walking directions. None of them were interesting enough to use beyond novelty, but Bose AR has potential.</p> <h2>Observations</h2> <ul> <li><p>The USB cable comes in a small microfibre bag lose in the case with the Frames, which makes getting them out a bit clumsy</p></li> <li><p>There\u2019s no microfibre bag for the Frames included, which would make using them and keeping them clean while out and about a bit easier</p></li> <li><p>Apple\u2019s Face ID works through both the black and mirrored silver polarised lenses</p></li> <li><p>Google Assistant/Siri is really good through the Frames</p></li> <li><p>Polarised lenses have an odd tendency to distort the pavement, making it look less flat than it really is</p></li> </ul> <h2>Price</h2> <p>The Bose Frames Alto cost <a href=\"https://www.bose.co.uk/en_gb/products/frames/bose-frames-alto/buy.html\">\u00a3199.95</a> with black lenses, with gradient blue lenses costing <a href=\"https://www.bose.co.uk/en_gb/products/headphones/headphone_accessories/bose-lens-alto.html#v=bose_lens_alto_blue_row\">\u00a319.95</a> and mirrored silver polarised lenses costing <a href=\"https://www.bose.co.uk/en_gb/products/headphones/headphone_accessories/bose-lens-alto.html#v=bose_lens_alto_silver_row\">\u00a329.95</a> as optional extras.</p> <p>The Bose Frames Rondo cost <a href=\"https://www.bose.co.uk/en_gb/products/frames/bose-frames-rondo/buy.html\">\u00a3199.95</a> with black lenses, with gradient blue lenses costing <a href=\"https://www.bose.co.uk/en_gb/products/headphones/headphone_accessories/bose-lens-rondo.html#v=bose_lens_rondo_blue_row\">\u00a319.95</a> and mirrored rose gold polarised lenses costing <a href=\"https://www.bose.co.uk/en_gb/products/headphones/headphone_accessories/bose-lens-rondo.html#v=bose_lens_rondo_rose_gold_row\">\u00a329.95</a> as optional extras.</p> <p>For comparison, the Oakley Radar Pace, which has in-ear buds attached to the sunglasses, costs \u00a3400<strong> </strong>while various bone conduction sunglasses cost from about \u00a3100.</p> <h2>Verdict</h2> <p>The Bose Frames are delightful \u2013 a set of premium sunglasses that also act as your personal music system. Kept to 50% or lower those next to you can\u2019t hear your music, but because your ears are open you can hear the world around you.</p> <p>Clearly this is a massive advantage for cyclists or pedestrians, but it also means you\u2019re subjected to the noise of the world around you. For anyone who always walks around with earbuds in, as I do, this can be quite overwhelming when you first start out.</p> <p>They look good enough that I ended up wearing them even when not listening to music.

      "bodyText": "The Bose Frames are the answer to the question: what if your sunglasses were also a set of smart, hidden headphones with no earbuds or no bone-conduction system, just a set of personal speakers? As a wearer of true wireless earbuds, that\u2019s not a question I ever thought I would ask. But the Bose Frames are delightful and leaving your ears free of buds or headphones has a clear and obvious case. The term \u201csmart glasses\u201d\u2019 might conjure up visions of Google\u2019s ill-fated Glass, but the Bose Frames are not in the same league. There\u2019s no screen, camera or any visible signs of \u201csmart\u201d from the front. Instead they have built-in sensors and a pair of hidden speakers, which pipe music to your ears. Bose has nailed the design of the Frames. They look like regular unisex sunglasses. Granted, the arms are a bit thicker and wider near the ears, where traditional sunglasses would taper, and there\u2019s a small gold button for turning them on and controlling music. But I was happy wearing them when not listening to music. There\u2019s a choice of two frames: the larger, squarer Alto (as tested) and the smaller, rounder Rondo. Both are made from black nylon, come with black lenses and look fairly generic. Other lenses are available as optional accessories, including a set of mirrored polarised (\u00a330) or blue gradient (\u00a320), which pop in and out easily enough with a bit of light force applied to the lens. But that\u2019s about as far as customisation goes. Prescription lenses are coming, but aren\u2019t available in the UK yet. They\u2019re comfortable to wear for extended periods without pinching on the nose or ears, and fold up just like any regular set. They weigh 45g, which is about the weight of a thicker set of premium sunglasses. If I was to nitpick I would say that the black frames look a little cheap and almost too generic. But the fact that\u2019s even worth mentioning is testament to how not like other smart glasses the Frames are. How they work and sound The glasses sound amazingly good for what they are. Two small speakers sit in the frame just in front of your ears. The music is directed straight to your ear through small speaker grilles, while cancelling sound is projected out into the world. The result is a sound leakage of about 1%, according to Bose. In the real world if you have the volume below 50% people sitting right next to you won\u2019t hear it. In fact I took delight in the look of surprise on people\u2019s faces when I gave them the Frames and they suddenly heard my tunes blasting out as they put them on. It\u2019s really very impressive. In terms of raw sound quality, the Frames sound like a very open set of quality earbuds. They lack deep bass, but give them something complex and they shine with energy and warmth, with excellent separation and clarity. Crank them up beyond 85% volume and you start to hear distortion, but they pretty loud by that point. Most of my listening was about at 60% on the street or about 30% in quieter spots. The one thing the Frames can\u2019t do that earbuds can is protect you from the loud din of a city. You can forget hearing music on a screeching train or while walking by a working jackhammer. In this regard they are very much like Apple\u2019s popular AirPods. Controls and connectivity The Frames support standard Bluetooth audio (SBC) as well as the higher quality AAC audio, and had rock-solid connectivity with both Android phones and the iPhone. No noticeable lipsync issues were present either, which made the Frames great for watching video. The microphone was surprisingly good, picking up my voice clearly for the other end of the call (or Google Assistant/Siri). Be warned though: with no earbuds visible people think you\u2019re talking to yourself. Turning on the Frames is as easy as pressing the single discreet button under the right arm. The button also serves for pause/play or accepting a call. Double press to skip forward, triple for back. Anyone who has used wireless earbuds before will be familiar with this. To switch them off just turn them upside down for a second or so. It all works great. The one thing they\u2019re missing is volume control, so you\u2019ll be reaching for your phone for that, which is a shame. Battery life You get just over three hours of continuous listening out of the Frames before the battery runs dry, which is normally enough. Charging is fairly slow and needs a proprietary magnetic USB cable that snaps on to the inside of the right arm. The Frames come with a traditional sunglasses case, which is a missed opportunity. Most true wireless earbuds last about three hours, but are charged multiple times by their case. The Frames could really do with a battery in the case. It\u2019s too easy to forget to charge them, turning them into standard sunglasses. Bose AR The smart bit of the Frames is support for the firm\u2019s audio augmented reality platform, Bose AR, which is also available on the Bose\u2019s popular QC35 II headphones, and on the upcoming Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700. The Frames know which way you\u2019re facing and your location from the GPS on your phone, so you can use audio to feed information about the real world into your ears. But the platform only supports iOS at the moment and lacks a killer app. The best of the bunch are some 3D audio experiences, a golf app that can tell you where the hole is and some walking directions. None of them were interesting enough to use beyond novelty, but Bose AR has potential. Observations The USB cable comes in a small microfibre bag lose in the case with the Frames, which makes getting them out a bit clumsy There\u2019s no microfibre bag for the Frames included, which would make using them and keeping them clean while out and about a bit easier Apple\u2019s Face ID works through both the black and mirrored silver polarised lenses Google Assistant/Siri is really good through the Frames Polarised lenses have an odd tendency to distort the pavement, making it look less flat than it really is Price The Bose Frames Alto cost \u00a3199.95 with black lenses, with gradient blue lenses costing \u00a319.95 and mirrored silver polarised lenses costing \u00a329.95 as optional extras. The Bose Frames Rondo cost \u00a3199.95 with black lenses, with gradient blue lenses costing \u00a319.95 and mirrored rose gold polarised lenses costing \u00a329.95 as optional extras. For comparison, the Oakley Radar Pace, which has in-ear buds attached to the sunglasses, costs \u00a3400 while various bone conduction sunglasses cost from about \u00a3100. Verdict The Bose Frames are delightful \u2013 a set of premium sunglasses that also act as your personal music system. Kept to 50% or lower those next to you can\u2019t hear your music, but because your ears are open you can hear the world around you. Clearly this is a massive advantage for cyclists or pedestrians, but it also means you\u2019re subjected to the noise of the world around you. For anyone who always walks around with earbuds in, as I do, this can be quite overwhelming when you first start out. They look good enough that I ended up wearing them even when not listening to music. And when you do switch them on they sound surprisingly good, with rich audio that sparkles with the right track. There\u2019s simply no comparison with bone conduction or similar other non-earbud personal audio technologies. Listening to your tunes while still being able to hear the great outdoors while sitting in the garden or park in brilliant sunshine is thoroughly enjoyable. Trying to listen to a podcast while travelling on London\u2019s noisy Piccadilly line, not so much. So the Frames will never be the only set of headphones you need, and they could do with a battery in the case, volume controls and a few more styles, not to mention prescription lenses and some killer Bose AR apps. But even at \u00a3200 the Bose Frames are the most interesting piece of wearable technology I have donned since the original Google Glass. Pros: music without blocking your ears or making a racket for others, look good, choice of lenses and frames, comfortable, sound good, solid Bluetooth connection, excellent call quality Cons: no battery in the case and only 3.5 hours between charges, will never be your only set of earphones, can\u2019t protect from noise of the outside world, AR potential unrealised Other reviews Best true wireless earbuds 2019: AirPods, Samsung, Jabra and Anker compared and ranked Five of the best noise-cancelling headphones SubPack S2 review: portable mega-club experience, without the hearing loss Google Glass review: useful \u2013 but overpriced and socially awkward",

      "body": "<p>In May 2017, two of Donald Trump\u2019s senior advisers, Jared Kushner and Steve Bannon, met for a private dinner with top leaders of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The pair learned of a plan by the two American allies to impose a blockade on another US ally, Qatar, according to congressional staffers.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s secretary of state at the time, Rex Tillerson, was left in the dark. Tillerson only learned of the meeting two months ago, when he was interviewed for seven hours in a closed-door session with lawyers and staffers working for the House foreign affairs committee.</p> <p>Tillerson\u2019s testimony, which was <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/27/tillerson-kushner-exit-interview-1385305\">made public</a> last week, highlighted the inner workings of the Trump administration and revealed the extent to which Kushner \u2013 and to a lesser degree, Bannon, who left the administration in August 2017 \u2013 were conducting a shadow foreign policy. When asked how he felt about being left out of such vital meetings as America\u2019s top diplomat, Tillerson <a href=\"https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/_cache/files/e/7/e7bd0ed2-cf98-4f6d-a473-0406b0c50cde/23A0BEE4DF2B55E9D91259F04A3B22FA.tillerson-transcript-interview-5-21-19.pdf\">told the committee</a>: \u201cIt makes me angry \u2026 I didn\u2019t have a say. The state department\u2019s views were never expressed.\u201d</p> <p>The meeting in May 2017 was crucial because it helped solidify a Trump foreign policy favoring Saudi Arabia and the UAE in their conflict with Qatar, a tiny emirate in the Gulf that is rich in natural gas and home to a major US military base. It also raises questions about a problem that has dogged Kushner since the earliest days of the Trump administration: whether his family\u2019s business interests are driving his political decisions.</p> <p>Weeks before the blockade, Kushner\u2019s father \u2013 the real estate developer Charles Kushner \u2013 met with a top Qatari official to seek financing for a distressed Manhattan office tower. The Qataris declined. One must wonder: did Jared Kushner support a blockade of a US ally as political payback because it would not fund his family\u2019s business?</p> <p>In his role as the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, Kushner has cultivated a close relationship between Trump and the ruthless Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Trump has tried to shield the prince from blame for the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, despite a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html\">CIA assessment that concluded</a>, with \u201chigh confidence\u201d, that the prince had ordered the killing. Trump and Kushner have offered Saudi Arabia unwavering support for <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/saudi-arabia-is-the-top-buyer-of-u-s-weapons/\">continued weapons sales</a> and business deals with the kingdom.</p> <p>In February 2018, the Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/kushners-overseas-contacts-raise-concerns-as-foreign-officials-seek-leverage/2018/02/27/16bbc052-18c3-11e8-942d-16a950029788_story.html?utm_term=.3fd45f216c6b\">reported</a> that US intelligence services were worried that officials in at least four countries \u2013 the UAE, Israel, Mexico and China \u2013 had discussed ways to manipulate Kushner. The paper quoted US officials saying that Kushner was \u201cna\u00efve and being tricked\u201d in his contacts with foreign leaders, who tried to take advantage of his complex business arrangements and lack of foreign policy experience. That month, Kushner\u2019s interim security clearance was downgraded from top secret to secret, which restricted his access to the most sensitive US government information. In May 2018, however, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/us/politics/jared-kushner-security-clearance.html\">Trump ordered his chief of staff</a> to give Kushner a permanent top-secret clearance, over the objections of US intelligence officials concerned about his contacts with foreign leaders and his business dealings.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Saudi leaders had figured out that they could influence Kushner because of his lack of knowledge and enthusiasm to negotiate a Middle East peace deal</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Even before Trump took office, Saudi leaders had figured out that they could influence Kushner because of his lack of knowledge about the Middle East and enthusiasm to negotiate a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. In November 2016, Prince Mohammed sent a delegation of Saudi officials to the US to meet with Kushner and other Trump advisers. The Saudis wrote a prescient assessment that was later <a href=\"https://www.al-akhbar.com/Arab_Island/262756/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B9%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%80%D9%80-%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%83%D8%B3-%D8%AA%D8%A3%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AE-%D8%B9%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%86-%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85\">leaked</a> to the Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar: Trump\u2019s \u201cinner circle is predominantly deal makers who lack familiarity with political customs and deep institutions, and they support Jared Kushner\u201d.</p> <p>The Kushner family\u2019s financial troubles began after it purchased an office tower at 666 Fifth Avenue for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/03/nyregion/kushners-building-fifth-avenue-brookfield-lease.html\">a record $1.8</a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/03/nyregion/kushners-building-fifth-avenue-brookfield-lease.html\">bn in 2007</a>, at the height of a real estate market that crashed a year later. Since 2016, Kushner Companies had negotiated with investors from China and Qatar to bail out the property, which was facing $1.4bn in loan payments due in February 2019. But those deals fell through because the investors, who had connections to the Chinese and Qatari governments, worried about the public scrutiny created by Kushner\u2019s job in the White House.</p> <p>Kushner insists he has played no role in negotiations over the Fifth Avenue tower. After he joined the Trump administration as a senior adviser in January 2017, Kushner resigned as the chief executive of his family\u2019s company. He <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cmbs-kushner/kushner-divests-equity-in-major-nyc-property-idUSKBN15F24M\">sold his stake</a> in the Fifth Avenue building and some other assets to a family trust. But Kushner kept a substantial stake in his family\u2019s firm, and he and his wife, Ivanka Trump, own real estate and other holdings worth <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/11/business/ivanka-trump-jared-kushner-investing.html\">more than $800m</a>, according to disclosure forms.</p> <p>The Kushner family focused on Qatar as a potential savior for its investment even before Trump\u2019s election. In 2015 and 2016, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/07/10/jared-kushner-tried-and-failed-to-get-a-half-billion-dollar-bailout-from-qatar/\">according to the Intercept</a>, Jared Kushner and his father Charles negotiated with the Qatari billionaire and investor Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani, who had served as Qatar\u2019s prime minister. The businessman offered a deal worth about $500m, but it was contingent on Kushner Companies securing investments from other creditors. The deal fell through when the Kushners were unable to secure other funding.</p> <p>Then, in April 2017, the Intercept <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2018/03/02/jared-kushner-real-estate-qatar-blockade/\">reports</a>, Charles Kushner and other officials in the family real estate firm met with the Qatari finance minister, seeking an investment from Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund to bail out the troubled Fifth Avenue property. The Qataris declined.</p> <p>That meeting in late April 2017, just weeks before the crisis erupted between Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar, is pivotal because it was the first time that the Kushners had directly approached a representative of the Qatari government. Democratic congressional staffers zeroed in on that meeting and subsequent events in their questioning of Tillerson. And while the former top diplomat demurred in answering directly, the line of questioning revealed that House investigators are exploring the sequence of events involving Kushner\u2019s family company and the blockade of Qatar.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/15/jared-kushner-cadre-corruption-ethics-foreign-funding\">Jared Kushner may have an ethics problem - to the tune of $90m | Vicky Ward</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWere you concerned, sir, that Mr Kushner\u2019s family was seeking significant funding from Qatar at the same time as he was involved in decisions of this magnitude that involved Qatar?\u201d <a href=\"https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/_cache/files/e/7/e7bd0ed2-cf98-4f6d-a473-0406b0c50cde/23A0BEE4DF2B55E9D91259F04A3B22FA.tillerson-transcript-interview-5-21-19.pdf\">one staffer asked Tillerson</a>.</p> <p>Tillerson responded: \u201cYour question assumes that I was aware that he was involved in decisions around Qatar.

Saudi leaders accused Qatar of financing terrorism; supporting Islamist groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas; and undermining Arab efforts to isolate Iran. They imposed a blockade, sealing off Qatar\u2019s only land border, and restricting air and sea travel to and from the peninsula.</p> <p>Initially, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/06/qatar-panic-buying-as-shoppers-stockpile-food-due-to-saudi-blockade\">Trump sided with Saudi Arabia</a> and the UAE in their campaign to isolate Qatar. With a series of tweets criticizing Qatar, he undermined efforts by two of his top national security aides, Tillerson and the then defense secretary, Jim Mattis, to defuse the crisis.

Tillerson only learned of the meeting two months ago, when he was interviewed for seven hours in a closed-door session with lawyers and staffers working for the House foreign affairs committee. Tillerson\u2019s testimony, which was made public last week, highlighted the inner workings of the Trump administration and revealed the extent to which Kushner \u2013 and to a lesser degree, Bannon, who left the administration in August 2017 \u2013 were conducting a shadow foreign policy. When asked how he felt about being left out of such vital meetings as America\u2019s top diplomat, Tillerson told the committee: \u201cIt makes me angry \u2026 I didn\u2019t have a say. The state department\u2019s views were never expressed.\u201d The meeting in May 2017 was crucial because it helped solidify a Trump foreign policy favoring Saudi Arabia and the UAE in their conflict with Qatar, a tiny emirate in the Gulf that is rich in natural gas and home to a major US military base. It also raises questions about a problem that has dogged Kushner since the earliest days of the Trump administration: whether his family\u2019s business interests are driving his political decisions. Weeks before the blockade, Kushner\u2019s father \u2013 the real estate developer Charles Kushner \u2013 met with a top Qatari official to seek financing for a distressed Manhattan office tower. The Qataris declined. One must wonder: did Jared Kushner support a blockade of a US ally as political payback because it would not fund his family\u2019s business? In his role as the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, Kushner has cultivated a close relationship between Trump and the ruthless Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Trump has tried to shield the prince from blame for the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, despite a CIA assessment that concluded, with \u201chigh confidence\u201d, that the prince had ordered the killing. Trump and Kushner have offered Saudi Arabia unwavering support for continued weapons sales and business deals with the kingdom. In February 2018, the Washington Post reported that US intelligence services were worried that officials in at least four countries \u2013 the UAE, Israel, Mexico and China \u2013 had discussed ways to manipulate Kushner. The paper quoted US officials saying that Kushner was \u201cna\u00efve and being tricked\u201d in his contacts with foreign leaders, who tried to take advantage of his complex business arrangements and lack of foreign policy experience. That month, Kushner\u2019s interim security clearance was downgraded from top secret to secret, which restricted his access to the most sensitive US government information. In May 2018, however, Trump ordered his chief of staff to give Kushner a permanent top-secret clearance, over the objections of US intelligence officials concerned about his contacts with foreign leaders and his business dealings. Even before Trump took office, Saudi leaders had figured out that they could influence Kushner because of his lack of knowledge about the Middle East and enthusiasm to negotiate a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. In November 2016, Prince Mohammed sent a delegation of Saudi officials to the US to meet with Kushner and other Trump advisers. The Saudis wrote a prescient assessment that was later leaked to the Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar: Trump\u2019s \u201cinner circle is predominantly deal makers who lack familiarity with political customs and deep institutions, and they support Jared Kushner\u201d. The Kushner family\u2019s financial troubles began after it purchased an office tower at 666 Fifth Avenue for a record $1.8bn in 2007, at the height of a real estate market that crashed a year later. Since 2016, Kushner Companies had negotiated with investors from China and Qatar to bail out the property, which was facing $1.4bn in loan payments due in February 2019. But those deals fell through because the investors, who had connections to the Chinese and Qatari governments, worried about the public scrutiny created by Kushner\u2019s job in the White House. Kushner insists he has played no role in negotiations over the Fifth Avenue tower. After he joined the Trump administration as a senior adviser in January 2017, Kushner resigned as the chief executive of his family\u2019s company. He sold his stake in the Fifth Avenue building and some other assets to a family trust. But Kushner kept a substantial stake in his family\u2019s firm, and he and his wife, Ivanka Trump, own real estate and other holdings worth more than $800m, according to disclosure forms. The Kushner family focused on Qatar as a potential savior for its investment even before Trump\u2019s election. In 2015 and 2016, according to the Intercept, Jared Kushner and his father Charles negotiated with the Qatari billionaire and investor Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani, who had served as Qatar\u2019s prime minister. The businessman offered a deal worth about $500m, but it was contingent on Kushner Companies securing investments from other creditors. The deal fell through when the Kushners were unable to secure other funding. Then, in April 2017, the Intercept reports, Charles Kushner and other officials in the family real estate firm met with the Qatari finance minister, seeking an investment from Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund to bail out the troubled Fifth Avenue property. The Qataris declined. That meeting in late April 2017, just weeks before the crisis erupted between Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar, is pivotal because it was the first time that the Kushners had directly approached a representative of the Qatari government. Democratic congressional staffers zeroed in on that meeting and subsequent events in their questioning of Tillerson. And while the former top diplomat demurred in answering directly, the line of questioning revealed that House investigators are exploring the sequence of events involving Kushner\u2019s family company and the blockade of Qatar. \u201cWere you concerned, sir, that Mr Kushner\u2019s family was seeking significant funding from Qatar at the same time as he was involved in decisions of this magnitude that involved Qatar?\u201d one staffer asked Tillerson. Tillerson responded: \u201cYour question assumes that I was aware that he was involved in decisions around Qatar. I\u2019m unaware of that.\u201d The Democratic congressional staffers told Tillerson that they learned about the dinner on 20 May 2017 in which Kushner, Bannon and Saudi and UAE leaders discussed plans for the blockade of Qatar. The two Trump advisers were in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, as a part of a large US delegation accompanying Trump, after he decided to make the kingdom his first stop on his maiden foreign trip as president. Kushner and Prince Mohammed played key roles in organizing that two-day trip, where Saudi rulers feted Trump with multiple banquets and displays of admiration. Two weeks later, in the early hours of 5 June 2017, Saudi Arabia and three of its allies \u2013 the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain \u2013 severed diplomatic and economic relations with Qatar. Saudi leaders accused Qatar of financing terrorism; supporting Islamist groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas; and undermining Arab efforts to isolate Iran. They imposed a blockade, sealing off Qatar\u2019s only land border, and restricting air and sea travel to and from the peninsula. Initially, Trump sided with Saudi Arabia and the UAE in their campaign to isolate Qatar. With a series of tweets criticizing Qatar, he undermined efforts by two of his top national security aides, Tillerson and the then defense secretary, Jim Mattis, to defuse the crisis. Trump has since expressed support for Qatar, but Saudi Arabia and the UAE are still leading the blockade. A year after its ill-fated outreach to the Qatari government, Kushner\u2019s family found a savior for its Manhattan office tower. In May 2018, Kushner Companies negotiated a bailout deal with Brookfield Asset Management, one of the world\u2019s largest real estate companies. The second-largest investor in Brookfield\u2019s real estate subsidiary happens to be Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund.

They are unprotected flesh, blood and bone entirely reliant on the care and goodwill of a potentially distracted, even hostile stranger piloting a vast, metal machine that could so easily maim or kill them.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3292b85b-823a-458e-871c-fee2d6794b91\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DBP2LTQxqZ8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>And the way those strangers feel about cyclists, the negative messages they are fed, or that are reinforced, by the media, can potentially play a role in how careful they are when driving.</p> \n<p>It is a difficult notion to conclusively prove, but there are studies that indicate drivers can and do <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0001457513004636\">take half-conscious split-second decisions</a> about how much space to leave a cyclist; and others that show drivers with negative attitudes towards cyclists <a href=\"https://trl.co.uk/reports/TRL549\">might be less cautious towards them</a>.</p> \n<p>And so it\u2019s my belief that Channel 5, and Firecracker Films, responsible for this nonsense, have made me marginally less safe on the roads; the same applies to loved ones and everyone else on two wheels. Thanks a bundle.</p> \n<p>Now, to save you the bother of watching this, here\u2019s why I believe the programme is so irresponsible.</p> \n<h2>It openly \u201cothers\u201d cyclists</h2> \n<p>The language of prejudice and hatred tends to have one thing in common \u2013 it seeks to creates \u201coutgroups\u201d, those who are seen as another, not part of the mainstream. At its more sinister ends, it also uses language which views the outgroup as somehow less than human.</p> \n<p>Amazingly, the programme does both. The narration refers to \u201cswarms\u201d of cyclists, while one interviewee, a London taxi driver, likens them to \u201ca plague of locusts coming down the road\u201d.</p> \n<p>Throughout, the narration repeatedly and deliberately talks of cyclists as the other \u2013 \u201cthis lot\u201d as they are referred to at one point \u2013 while drivers are seen as the mainstream. A long section of the programme details the anti-cycling opinions of some London taxi drivers, who are introduced as \u201cthree of the city\u2019s finest\u201d.</p> \n<p>The message could hardly be clearer.</p> \n<h2>The narration is openly hostile and aggressive</h2> \n<p>I was, at times, genuinely open-mouthed at the narration. It\u2019s best shown by a series of direct quotes. These are genuine, I promise.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Many motorists see cyclists as scum of the roads \u2013 speeding through crossings, riding where they shouldn\u2019t, and generally hogging the roads.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>For many drivers in the capital, cyclists have become public enemy number one.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>What really winds motorists up is the feeling that cyclists are allowed to pedal outside of the law.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>It\u2019s not just in cities that some riders are on a right old rampage.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>The pastoral dream \u2013 or it was until the cyclists came.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Cyclists sure can be a pain in the rear end, and some are a danger on the roads.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h2>It creates a false narrative of \u201cwar\u201d between different road users</h2> \n<p>The programme\u2019s researchers were clearly briefed to find the most aggressive and extreme footage they could find on YouTube, and they delivered. It is, the narration says, \u201cthe battle for Britain\u2019s roads\u201d.</p> \n<p>Aside from being needlessly confrontational and hugely irresponsible, this is also utter nonsense for two very obvious reasons. Firstly: these are very often the same people. About 90% of British Cycling members also drive.</p> \n<p>Also, \u201cwar\u201d implies at least some equality in numbers and reciprocal threat. Chris Boardman possibly put it best: \u201cYou\u2019ve got 2% of vulnerable road users versus 98% in two tonnes of steel. How can you possibly have a war? I think that\u2019s called a massacre.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Too many of the contributors are chosen for their hostility</h2> \n<p>Perhaps the most airtime is given to a series of London taxi drivers, whose many problems with cyclists are given a long and sympathetic hearing. London\u2019s cabbies have a reputation for ill-tempered and prejudiced views about lots of different groups, which are usually not heard with such credulity.</p> \n<p>Even more grim is the opportunity given to Nick \u201cMr Loophole\u201d Freeman, a lawyer and absurd self-publicist whose day job involves getting celebrity drivers out of punishment for alleged behaviour that genuinely is harmful to others \u2013 speeding. He has a long and tedious sideline in calling for cyclists to be registered and wear number-plate tabards.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey need to be legislated, they need to be controlled, and they need to comply with the laws of the land, in exactly the same way that we do,\u201d Freeman says at one point, oblivious to the pathetic paradox between this view and his own day job.</p> \n<h2>The \u201cbalance\u201d is \u2013 for the most part \u2013 cursory and poorly-handled</h2> \n<p>The only bearable section of the programme follows PC Hodson on patrol, pulling over drivers who pass him too close on his bike, in some cases while merrily chatting on the phone. He is \u2013 as always \u2013 excellent. However, this is just five minutes of 45.</p> \n<p>In contrast, the other voice-of-the-cyclist is a <a href=\"https://road.cc/content/news/236875-vigilante-cyclist-dave-sherry-knocked-bike-lorry-driver-link-video\">man called Dave Sherry</a>, who rides his bike adorned with cameras and wearing a Kevlar stab vest, pedalling around his local streets on the hunt for lawbreaking drivers.</p> \n<p>I have no objection to using camera footage to prosecute dangerous driving, but Sherry seems almost as fervent a self-publicist and irritant as Freeman, often delighting in the furious reaction of motorists.</p> \n<h2>It repeats falsehoods unchallenged</h2> \n<p>The cavalier approach to facts begins, amazingly, with the very first words spoken: \u201cBritain has gone bike mad.\u201d It hasn\u2019t. Cycling levels have risen in some places, but nationwide the percentage of trips made by bike is stuck stubbornly on about 2%. It\u2019s a common mistake, generally made by people who rarely leave central London.</p> \n<p>Things don\u2019t get any better. Among the falsehoods made, either by the narration or by contributors, which are not corrected or countered, are:</p> \n<p>\u2022 Cyclists are particularly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/video/2019/may/09/do-cyclists-think-theyre-above-the-law-and-does-it-even-matter-video\">prone to break the law.</a> One taxi driver says: \u201cMost of the accidents, when you look at them, are probably the cyclists wearing headphones.

      "bodyText": "On Wednesday morning, I\u2019ll be a little bit more wary when I cycle into work. I\u2019m always hugely careful, anyway \u2013 the trip involves sharing space with tonne-plus lumps of speeding metal \u2013 but this time I\u2019ll be particularly on my guard. Why? Because Channel 5 are putting me, and others, at risk. At 9.15pm on Tuesday, a reasonably sizeable number of people, the majority of whom probably drive motor vehicles, will sit down to watch what is undoubtedly the worst, most scaremongering, inaccurate, downright irresponsible programme on cycling I\u2019ve ever seen. Cyclists: Scourge of the Streets? \u2013 though the preview version also seemed to call it Cycle Wars \u2013 is, in effect, 45 minutes of hatred, misinformation and outgrouping against people who just happen to sometimes use two wheels to get about. Cheaply-made, exploitative TV is nothing new, not even when it\u2019s about cycling, as demonstrated by the BBC\u2019s deeply misleading War on Britain\u2019s Roads in 2012. But the Channel 5 offering feels uniquely damaging. While it does contain one sensible, balancing voice, the saintly PC Mark Hodson from the pioneering traffic unit of West Midlands police, the overall tone is shockingly hostile and provocative. Below, I explain why I found it so unsettling. But first, the inevitable question: why does any of this matter? Bad TV does tend to punch down, to target easy-to-scapegoat groups such as people reliant on social security. Why worry? The reason is this: for all that a fair number of people who cycle in the UK can often be assertive, even relatively privileged, when off the bike, on the roads they are almost uniquely vulnerable. They are unprotected flesh, blood and bone entirely reliant on the care and goodwill of a potentially distracted, even hostile stranger piloting a vast, metal machine that could so easily maim or kill them. And the way those strangers feel about cyclists, the negative messages they are fed, or that are reinforced, by the media, can potentially play a role in how careful they are when driving. It is a difficult notion to conclusively prove, but there are studies that indicate drivers can and do take half-conscious split-second decisions about how much space to leave a cyclist; and others that show drivers with negative attitudes towards cyclists might be less cautious towards them. And so it\u2019s my belief that Channel 5, and Firecracker Films, responsible for this nonsense, have made me marginally less safe on the roads; the same applies to loved ones and everyone else on two wheels. Thanks a bundle. Now, to save you the bother of watching this, here\u2019s why I believe the programme is so irresponsible. It openly \u201cothers\u201d cyclists The language of prejudice and hatred tends to have one thing in common \u2013 it seeks to creates \u201coutgroups\u201d, those who are seen as another, not part of the mainstream. At its more sinister ends, it also uses language which views the outgroup as somehow less than human. Amazingly, the programme does both. The narration refers to \u201cswarms\u201d of cyclists, while one interviewee, a London taxi driver, likens them to \u201ca plague of locusts coming down the road\u201d. Throughout, the narration repeatedly and deliberately talks of cyclists as the other \u2013 \u201cthis lot\u201d as they are referred to at one point \u2013 while drivers are seen as the mainstream. A long section of the programme details the anti-cycling opinions of some London taxi drivers, who are introduced as \u201cthree of the city\u2019s finest\u201d. The message could hardly be clearer.

Many motorists see cyclists as scum of the roads \u2013 speeding through crossings, riding where they shouldn\u2019t, and generally hogging the roads. For many drivers in the capital, cyclists have become public enemy number one. What really winds motorists up is the feeling that cyclists are allowed to pedal outside of the law. It\u2019s not just in cities that some riders are on a right old rampage. The pastoral dream \u2013 or it was until the cyclists came. Cyclists sure can be a pain in the rear end, and some are a danger on the roads. It creates a false narrative of \u201cwar\u201d between different road users The programme\u2019s researchers were clearly briefed to find the most aggressive and extreme footage they could find on YouTube, and they delivered. It is, the narration says, \u201cthe battle for Britain\u2019s roads\u201d.

You can reach it easily by public transport: train to Exmouth then a boat (Puffin Water Taxi from the marina, \u00a35 return), or you can kayak over. Once there, you are treated to the very best that the West Country can offer, with quality mains starting at \u00a315. Don\u2019t leave without trying the crisp local ciders and the freshest mussels caught on the river below.

After a strenuous walk to see puffins, we found it hard to choose between lobster salad, crab linguine, mackerel tacos, rabbit stew, wild garlic and pea risotto, whisky and honey ice cream and a fudgy tarte tatin. <br>\u2022 <em><a href=\"https://www.cafecanna.co.uk/\" title=\"\">cafecanna.co.uk</a><br></em><strong>Helen Brazier</strong></p> \n<h2><strong>Cafe Fish, Isle of Mull, Inner Hebrides</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dabad9947c6fc0d248f6b63e5485e35ebc89f85c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dabad9947c6fc0d248f6b63e5485e35ebc89f85c/336_0_937_562/500.jpg\" alt=\"Cafe Fish, Isle of Mull\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p>At the end of the harbour at Tobermory, a small white-painted concrete box \u2013 once the ferry terminal for the brief crossing between Tobermory and Kilchoan on the Ardnamurchan peninsula \u2013 has been turned into the award-winning Cafe Fish.

My fisherman\u2019s roll was a succulent grilled plaice fillet jammed with salad and lemon into a pillowy bun. Summer sees lobster and crab rolls, and winter cod chowder.

      "bodyText": "Winning tip: River Exe Cafe, Exmouth, Devon Bobbing up and down in the middle of a sun-kissed Devon estuary, the River Exe Cafe is a real gem. You can reach it easily by public transport: train to Exmouth then a boat (Puffin Water Taxi from the marina, \u00a35 return), or you can kayak over. Once there, you are treated to the very best that the West Country can offer, with quality mains starting at \u00a315. Don\u2019t leave without trying the crisp local ciders and the freshest mussels caught on the river below. All this to the gentle sensation of the waves as boats glide by. \u2022 riverexecafe.com Steve Bassett Caf\u00e9 Canna, Inner Hebrides It takes some effort to reach the Isle of Canna, where the tiny population is hugely outnumbered by seabirds. With only a handful of houses scattered around the deep harbour, it was a delight to discover Caf\u00e9 Canna, a white cottage where cook Gareth turns out top-quality food from breakfast to dinner using produce straight from the sea, hills and community polytunnel. After a strenuous walk to see puffins, we found it hard to choose between lobster salad, crab linguine, mackerel tacos, rabbit stew, wild garlic and pea risotto, whisky and honey ice cream and a fudgy tarte tatin. \u2022 cafecanna.co.uk Helen Brazier Cafe Fish, Isle of Mull, Inner Hebrides At the end of the harbour at Tobermory, a small white-painted concrete box \u2013 once the ferry terminal for the brief crossing between Tobermory and Kilchoan on the Ardnamurchan peninsula \u2013 has been turned into the award-winning Cafe Fish. Its halibut comes from nearby (in sea miles) Gigha, the scallops and lobster from the Sound of Mull. Crisp goujons of fried fish trapped between thick slices of homebaked brown bread give new meaning to a fish finger sandwich. If supplies of local langoustines, crabs or mussels from the other side of Mull run out, chef Liz will summon more from her fisher family for the restaurant\u2019s next sitting. \u2022 thecafefish.com Julia East Pier, St Monans, Fife The East Pier smokes its own amazing, locally caught seafood from a tiny kitchen on the harbour wall \u2013 any closer and you\u2019d be in very cold water. You eat on the roof \u2013 the lobster, crab and fat chips \u2013 and help yourself to crisp New Zealand sauvignon and local beer from the fridge. It gets busy when the sun\u2019s out, but try eating there in the cold, with the wind-whipped spray in your face, for an authentic taste of salt-coated Scotland. \u2022 eastpier.co.uk Simon Platt Latimer\u2019s Seafood Deli and Cafe, Whitburn, Sunderland We spotted this place up on the road while walking on the beach in Whitburn and looking for a fish and chip shop. We walked it perhaps not expecting much. But it turned out to be the most delightful surprise. We had \u201cnaked fish and chips\u201d (cooked in a parcel without batter) from a choice of cod, haddock and skate. Lindisfarne oysters were \u00a38.95 for half a dozen. It was February but the weather was mild and sunny and eating fresh fish on the decking area in the sunshine gave us the feeling of being in southern Europe rather than by the North Sea. On the way out we stopped at the wet fish counter and stocked up on shellfish and good old-fashioned cod roe. \u2022 latimers.com Marcella Drift Caf\u00e9, Cresswell, Northumberland This cafe set in golden sand dunes serves delicious fare, from weird and wonderful black pudding scones to delightful homebaked cakes. It attracts dog-walkers, birdwatchers, holidaymakers and plenty of locals, and everyone is welcomed with a warm smile. Big conservatory-style windows boast sweeping views of the surrounding sand dunes and offer an exceptionally pleasant, light and airy dining experience. \u2022 On Facebook Jade McKay Dungeness Snack Shack, Kent It\u2019s easy to drive on past this rickety cabin adrift on Dungeness\u2019s peculiar shingled nuclear shoreline. But it serves some of the most thrilling food you\u2019ll eat at the seaside. From a shipping container kitchen, the cheery team delivers a short but miraculous menu of fish and seafood, all seasonal and sustainably caught by the family\u2019s own boats. My fisherman\u2019s roll was a succulent grilled plaice fillet jammed with salad and lemon into a pillowy bun. Summer sees lobster and crab rolls, and winter cod chowder. Sit on a picnic table, scoured by wind and sun, and ponder eternity over a homemade fish finger. \u2022 dungenesssnackshack.net David Ellis Billy\u2019s on the Beach, East Wittering, West Sussex Near the picturesque villages and beaches of the Witterings is this place offering fabulous, good-value seafood (I recommended the seafood platter for \u00a312.50: a mountain of prawns, smoked salmon and crab, with mouth-watering p\u00e2t\u00e9)in an airy seaside cafe, overlooking one of the best beaches for fossil hunting on the south coast. Cheap and cheerful cafe by day, Billy\u2019s turns into a bistro at night and, if you\u2019re lucky enough to catch a summer music night, there is fab music to listen to while you munch seafood and watch the sun go down. \u2022 billysonthebeach.co.uk Emma Hipkins Tea Rooms, Walton-on-the-Naze, Essex This has been a family business for several generations and retains a 1950s charm, serving excellent fare with simplicity and impeccable service. It\u2019s next to a safe beach, full of shells and fossils in a quiet part of the town near a resident seal colony and a national nature reserve. There is a huge veranda offering panoramic views of the North Sea and hundreds of brightly painted beach huts, with plenty of seats inside for inclement days. \u2022 On Facebook Isobel Ruckert Solebay Fish Company, Southwold, Suffolk Southwold harbour with the village of Walberswick only a rowing boat ferry away. An amazing seafood restaurant with a fishmonger takeaway at the entrance \u2013 particularly helpful if you are staying in the campsite a stone\u2019s throw away. It blends in with the harbour sheds alongside it from the outside but then opens up beautifully once you\u2019re in, with a striking nautical/rustic decor. There are excellent shellfish options, kippers, sprats, lobster, oysters and always daily specials. Dog-friendly too, and really good value for money with mains around \u00a314. \u2022 solebayfishco.co.uk Richard The Crab Hut, Brancaster Staithe, Norfolk It\u2019s just a shed nestled among rows of small sailing boats waiting for the tide to come in, but The Crab Hut is a great place to eat. The weathered crab pots stacked by the door give you a clue as to how fresh the ingredients are, and it\u2019s all loaded generously into baguettes to go with steaming tea served in chipped mugs. Sit back and watch sunlight fading into the wide and watery horizon, listen to egrets and terns swirling above \u2013 this is the way seafood is meant to be enjoyed. \u2022 On Facebook Matt Hedges Caf\u00e9 M\u00f4r, Freshwater West Beach, Pembrokeshire From Easter until the end of September, Caf\u00e9 M\u00f4r appears like some food truck mirage. The menu changes based on the market, with the Daily Catch Butty being the best value. The biggest draw, however, is its lobster rolls in Welsh sea black butter, a dish so delicious that the team was apparently invited over to Japan to cook them. Seeing as the fish is local, the seaweed picked feet away and the whole truck is powered by solar and wind, it\u2019s hard to picture a more sustainable meal. \u2022 beachfood.co.uk Tim Large Pysgoty, Aberystwyth, Ceredigion On the causeway between Aberystwyth harbour and the beach, this place is a gem. A converted toilet block, it only has seating for 10 inside and a small deck outside. The fish and seafood dishes are outstanding and most of it comes from the fishermen of Cardigan Bay. Start with crab salad (\u00a38) or sailor\u2019s scotch egg with curried mayo (\u00a37), then cod, chorizo and laverbread risotto (\u00a316.50). The cafe is also a great viewing spot for the dolphins that regularly swim in these waters. \u2022 pysgoty.co.uk Justin Beddows Half Moon Bay Cafe, Heysham, Lancashire The view across Morecambe Bay gets even better as you enjoy a full English breakfast. The fry-ups can be ordered all day, but there\u2019s also tasty homemade soup, sandwiches or scones and cream. In summer sit under the front canopy to admire the view across the sands to the Cumbrian mountains \u2013 in winter cosy up by the stove. Work up an appetite by first walking along the National Trust-owned headland from Heysham village or take the longer walk along the prom from Morecambe. \u2022 halfmoonbaycafe.co.uk Graham Dean Beach Cafe, Lytham St Annes, Lancashire With stunning views across the Ribble estuary to Southport and out to the Irish Sea this place has a top location. On a clear day you can see across to the Snowdonia mountaintops. The cafe has an eclectic selection of homemade and hearty food with Manx kippers a favourite (\u00a37.95) and a mixed seafood basket at \u00a38.50. It also serves alcohol so is a great location to watch the sunset. \u2022 beachcafefylde.co.uk Joe Sea Shed, Limavady, County Derry This is a one-of-a-kind place in a one-of-a-kind location, with Northern Ireland\u2019s beautiful seaside and its wild vibe still off the tourist trail. The Sea Shed is a cosy, chilled-out wee coffee shop (everything here is either \u201cwee\u201d or \u201cgrand\u201d \u2013 this place is both) right on Benone Strand. It not only sells amazing speciality coffee, suki tea and the famous Northern Irish traybakes, but is also a surf hire shop acting as a social hub for the laid-back visitors to this low-key surf spot. Coffees start at \u00a32 for a short black. \u2022 longlinesurfschool.co.uk Lucy Flanagan Rachel\u2019s, West Bay, Dorset The owner\u2019s husband is a fisherman and what he catches each morning is served just hours later \u2013 from the superb fish stew and chowder to crab sandwiches and Lyme Bay scallops. On the harbour front close to the beach surrounded by people eating al fresco, Rachel\u2019s is a small kiosk among typical fish and chip shacks. You can only book a noon table, otherwise you pay for the food and wait while watching the boats bobbing up and down. Get a seafood stew with fresh bread for \u00a38, the same for fish and chips, and it does seafood platters for two. \u2022 On Facebook Maria Newman Tatams, Portscatho, Cornwall Little sister/brother of the well-publicised Hidden Hut in the next bay on the beautiful Roseland peninsula, this gem has been built into the village\u2019s old public toilets and has a fabulous view out to sea from the high bar stools placed against the harbour wall. Or you can get takeaway and sit on the beach (if the tide allows) or on the Lugger. It consists of a cafe/takeaway, The Taverna, and a coffee hut serving melt-in-the-mouth Portuguese tarts and a selection of cakes. Mains served in the cafe include River Fal mussels and Newlyn squid in white wine (\u00a314). It has also provided visitors with new, very well-maintained public toilets which are a welcome relief when traversing the South West Coast Path. \u2022 tatams.co Janet Taco Boys, New Polzeath, Cornwall In a quiet corner of Cornwall, Taco Boys in Baby Bay will sort you out whether you\u2019re famished from surfing or just peckish after a gentle stroll around the bay. A converted horse box provides tacos \u2013 hake is a favourite \u2013 cooked fresh to order, using top-quality local ingredients and creating mouthwatering flavour combinations.

About 15 or so musicians \u2013 and at least one magician \u2013 assemble in Tattersalls Lane at Section 8, a pop-up container bar in an old car park. They stamp their feet to keep warm, leaning against the trolleys on which they lug their amps. Someone pushes together oil drums to make a table; someone else brings out a big whiteboard and a pack of playing cards.</p> <p>As the interloper, I\u2019m invited to cut the deck \u2013 and then the business begins.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/04/after-the-death-of-triple-rs-stephen-walker-the-ghosts-legacy-will-not-be-silenced\">After the death of Triple R's Stephen Walker, The Ghost's legacy lives on | Jeff Sparrow</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If you want to play Bourke Street, you must come on Wednesdays to be allocated a card.

Australian regulations on busking stem from a 19th century crusade against London street musicians. Before the Industrial Revolution, the secular music that ordinary people heard came, by and large, from itinerant players. But urbanisation changed respectable attitudes both to the street and to music.</p> <p>In 1600, London contained 200,000 people. By 1800 that number had grown to 900,000, an immense expansion that left authorities deeply suspicious of public gatherings, particularly noisy ones.</p> <p>The 1741 Hogarth engraving The Enraged Musician captures the new bourgeois sensibility. It shows a classical violinist blocking his ears as, outside his window, a raucous collection of drummers, singers and clarinetists play \u2013 and an urchin pisses gleefully against a wall.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b2832b98a68f956298a9c7b07e2c33225295221\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b2832b98a68f956298a9c7b07e2c33225295221/0_0_1500_1276/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Enraged Musician (1741) by William Hogarth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"851\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Enraged Musician (1741) by William Hogarth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: William Hogarth</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the key figures in the London campaign against buskers was Charles Babbage \u2013 a man best remembered for anticipating, with his \u201cdifference engine\u201d, the digital programmable computer. He wrote to the Times explaining that \u201cinstruments of torture\u201d such as \u201cbrass bands\u201d, \u201cfiddles\u201d, \u201churdy-gurdies\u201d and \u201cflageolets\u201d prevented him from concentrating.</p> <p>Babbage also complained that, as a result of these views, musicians were gathering deliberately to play directly under his windows. When he left the house, a \u201ccrowd of young children, urged on by their parents, and backed at a judicious distance by a set of vagabonds, form[ed] quite a noisy mob, following me as I pass along, and shouting out rather uncomplimentary epithets.\u201d</p> <p>Charles Dickens, too, wanted to stamp out buskers: he was, he said, \u201cdaily interrupted, harassed, worried, wearied [and] driven nearly mad by street musicians\u201d.</p> <p>The Australian colonies imitated the law eventually passed in London by British MP Michael Bass. It gave police the right to \u201cmove on\u201d performers deemed to be interrupting \u201cordinary occupations or pursuit\u201d. As a result, busking in Australia remained legally ambiguous (and thus innately perilous) throughout the 19th and 20th century.</p> <p>That began to change in the late 1970s, with governments <a href=\"http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MelbULawRw/2015/29.html\">gradually transitioning from prohibition</a> (albeit with de facto toleration) to official regulation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"d18d7af4007aa72a8e87fdeb154080baeade785e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d18d7af4007aa72a8e87fdeb154080baeade785e/470_313_2530_1687/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Melbourne busker Aaron Pollock entertains passersby in Bourke St Mall during his Saturday performance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Melbourne busker Aaron Pollock entertains passersby in Bourke Street Mall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Hopkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The City of Melbourne now offers three different permits for buskers. For the general area permit, buskers need only demonstrate an ability to perform safely. That requirement becomes more significant for a circle act permit, the classification applicable to jugglers, acrobats, fire twirlers and other acts requiring more space.</p> <p>It\u2019s the third, or premium, category that upsets some \u2013 though far from all \u2013 of the buskers. The premium permit allows performers to work in Bourke Street, traditionally the best space in the city. To obtain it, they must have busked for at least six months \u2013 and then pass an audition before a panel of other artists and council staff.</p> <p>\u201cOur new premium permit,\u201d says councillor Rohan Leppert, chair of the arts, culture and heritage portfolio, \u201cis heavily weighted towards the performance and engagement value of the act \u2013 alongside important considerations of sound levels, safety and crowd management.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a different approach to that taken in other busking hubs. In Sydney, council recently considered \u2013 and then rejected \u2013 a Melbourne-style auditions policy.</p> <p>Councillor Jess Scully from the cultural and community committee argues that any kind of aesthetic intervention by the city would be superfluous. \u201cWe decided that, actually, people vote with their coins and so it does self-regulate in that regard.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9cb67511cb4041048e13073d364917663d513477\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cb67511cb4041048e13073d364917663d513477/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jorge Cuba\u2019s coin collection basket.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jorge Cuba\u2019s coin collection basket.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Hopkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As evidence, she points to the spontaneous emergence of a new venue in George Street outside Town Hall, with the concrete anti-terror barriers providing an audience with seating. \u201cIt just happened. Suddenly this pitch developed and people are queuing up to perform.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the Melbourne performers make a similar claim.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s 10am on a chilly Wednesday morning and Melbourne\u2019s Bourke Street buskers are gathering. About 15 or so musicians \u2013 and at least one magician \u2013 assemble in Tattersalls Lane at Section 8, a pop-up container bar in an old car park. They stamp their feet to keep warm, leaning against the trolleys on which they lug their amps. Someone pushes together oil drums to make a table; someone else brings out a big whiteboard and a pack of playing cards. As the interloper, I\u2019m invited to cut the deck \u2013 and then the business begins. If you want to play Bourke Street, you must come on Wednesdays to be allocated a card. When your card\u2019s drawn, you can pick a position and a half-hour slot \u2013 the GPO on a Saturday or David Jones on a Friday or whatever you prefer. Today, though, they have other concerns. In April, the City of Melbourne implemented new regulations for the mall, including mandatory auditions for Bourke Street performers. In those trials, 24 buskers performed \u2013 and 17 were successful. But the failures included panpipes player Jorge Cuba and reggae artist Braza, both well regarded by their peers. \u201cCuba is an institution,\u201d says one busker, and others mutter their agreement. \u201cThe council talk about our responsibilities,\u201d says someone else, rubbing his hands against the cold. \u201cBut what about our rights?\u201d The rights of buskers have long been a contentious issue. Australian regulations on busking stem from a 19th century crusade against London street musicians. Before the Industrial Revolution, the secular music that ordinary people heard came, by and large, from itinerant players. But urbanisation changed respectable attitudes both to the street and to music. In 1600, London contained 200,000 people. By 1800 that number had grown to 900,000, an immense expansion that left authorities deeply suspicious of public gatherings, particularly noisy ones. The 1741 Hogarth engraving The Enraged Musician captures the new bourgeois sensibility. It shows a classical violinist blocking his ears as, outside his window, a raucous collection of drummers, singers and clarinetists play \u2013 and an urchin pisses gleefully against a wall. One of the key figures in the London campaign against buskers was Charles Babbage \u2013 a man best remembered for anticipating, with his \u201cdifference engine\u201d, the digital programmable computer. He wrote to the Times explaining that \u201cinstruments of torture\u201d such as \u201cbrass bands\u201d, \u201cfiddles\u201d, \u201churdy-gurdies\u201d and \u201cflageolets\u201d prevented him from concentrating. Babbage also complained that, as a result of these views, musicians were gathering deliberately to play directly under his windows. When he left the house, a \u201ccrowd of young children, urged on by their parents, and backed at a judicious distance by a set of vagabonds, form[ed] quite a noisy mob, following me as I pass along, and shouting out rather uncomplimentary epithets.\u201d Charles Dickens, too, wanted to stamp out buskers: he was, he said, \u201cdaily interrupted, harassed, worried, wearied [and] driven nearly mad by street musicians\u201d. The Australian colonies imitated the law eventually passed in London by British MP Michael Bass. It gave police the right to \u201cmove on\u201d performers deemed to be interrupting \u201cordinary occupations or pursuit\u201d. As a result, busking in Australia remained legally ambiguous (and thus innately perilous) throughout the 19th and 20th century. That began to change in the late 1970s, with governments gradually transitioning from prohibition (albeit with de facto toleration) to official regulation. The City of Melbourne now offers three different permits for buskers. For the general area permit, buskers need only demonstrate an ability to perform safely. That requirement becomes more significant for a circle act permit, the classification applicable to jugglers, acrobats, fire twirlers and other acts requiring more space. It\u2019s the third, or premium, category that upsets some \u2013 though far from all \u2013 of the buskers. The premium permit allows performers to work in Bourke Street, traditionally the best space in the city. To obtain it, they must have busked for at least six months \u2013 and then pass an audition before a panel of other artists and council staff. \u201cOur new premium permit,\u201d says councillor Rohan Leppert, chair of the arts, culture and heritage portfolio, \u201cis heavily weighted towards the performance and engagement value of the act \u2013 alongside important considerations of sound levels, safety and crowd management.\u201d It\u2019s a different approach to that taken in other busking hubs. In Sydney, council recently considered \u2013 and then rejected \u2013 a Melbourne-style auditions policy. Councillor Jess Scully from the cultural and community committee argues that any kind of aesthetic intervention by the city would be superfluous. \u201cWe decided that, actually, people vote with their coins and so it does self-regulate in that regard.\u201d As evidence, she points to the spontaneous emergence of a new venue in George Street outside Town Hall, with the concrete anti-terror barriers providing an audience with seating. \u201cIt just happened. Suddenly this pitch developed and people are queuing up to perform.\u201d Some of the Melbourne performers make a similar claim. Acts that don\u2019t earn money, they say, simply don\u2019t persist. In any case, busking requires a distinct set of skills, not merely reducible to musical talent. In 2007, violinist Joshua Bell, a virtuoso whose concert tickets sell out at premium prices, tried busking in a Washington street near a train station. He played his usual repertoire \u2013 and earned himself a mere $32 in three quarters of an hour. Jorge Cuba, by contrast, busks for a living, and has done so in Melbourne for the past 17 years. He shakes with emotion when he discusses his failed audition. \u201cIf you listen for one minute, you will hear that I can play.\u201d The assessors told Cuba his equipment wasn\u2019t loud enough; reggae artist Braza failed because he didn\u2019t pull a large enough crowd. It\u2019s these judgments that upset the buskers who see them as pretexts to drive out longstanding acts. In response, councillor Leppert says Melbourne contains more than 2,000 street performers, all competing for the best locations. \u201cIf a busker is unsuccessful through the live audition process we offer constructive feedback from the assessment panel and encourage them to reapply for another live audition, or continue honing their skills using their general area busking permit, which allows them to busk in many locations within the city,\u201d he says. In Bourke Street Mall, I talk to Aaron Pollock, a blues folk guitarist. He explains the system the regular buskers use. The spots begin on the hour, he says, with a subsequent act beginning 30 minutes later, tracing a zigzag pattern across the mall. If anyone\u2019s late, they let the others know through the special buskers\u2019 WhatsApp group. Pollock passed his audition and says opinions about the system are divided. \u201cI try to keep out of it because of the politics involved.\u201d He likes busking because he can play his own compositions, even though the money can vary immensely. \u201cI have made $20, I\u2019ve had days when I\u2019ve made $200.\u201d Most of his income derives from CD sales.

It has been three years since Duterte pledged to wipe out drug abuse in the Philippines by giving police unprecedented powers and near total impunity to kill any suspected drug addicts or dealers. Amnesty\u2019s new report detailed how the systematic killing of the urban poor has continued on such a scale it now amounts to crimes against humanity. The report told of nightly incidents where police would shoot defenceless suspects, or abduct them and take them to other locations where they would be shot. It found crime scenes were tampered with, evidence fabricated or planted and there was no accountability for the killing of suspects. According to the report, local officials were put under huge pressure by police to come up with vast numbers of names to put on the \u201cdrugs watch list\u201d without needing to provide any evidence they were using or selling drugs and without any legal process. Interviews by Amnesty told harrowing stories of figures such as Jovan Magtanong, a 30-year-old father of three, who was shot and killed by police when he was sleeping next to his children. Police had been looking for another man. Officers later claimed he had drugs and a gun on him, which witnesses refuted. \u201cThey killed him like an animal\u201d, a family member told Amnesty. The Amnesty report also highlighted how Bulacan province, in the central Luzon area, had overtaken the capital Metro Manila as the \u201cthe country\u2019s bloodiest killing field\u201d in the drugs war. This recent geographical shift was highlighted in recent analysis by the armed conflict location and event data project, which found that the highest proportion of this year\u2019s civilian drug war deaths deaths \u2013 almost 25% of the 490 people killed \u2013 had happened in the Central Luzon area. This has been attributed to a shift in focus, and police personnel, to the region and a subsequent rise in violent drug raids. Amnesty called on the UN Human Rights Council to open an independent inquiry to \u201cput an end to these crimes, and to provide justice and reparations for countless families and victims\u201d. It followed a draft resolution drawn up last week by more than a dozen countries formally calling on the United Nations human rights council to open an investigation into the war on drugs. Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International\u2019s regional director for east and southeast Asia, described the war on drugs over the past three years as \u201cnothing but a large-scale murdering enterprise for which the poor continue to pay the highest price,\u201d pointing out that it took nothing but a rumour of association with drugs for people in poor communities to be shot and killed by police without impunity. \u201cFear has now spread deep into the social fabric of society,\u201d said Bequelin. \u201cIt is time for the United Nations, starting with its Human Rights Council, to act decisively to hold President Duterte and his government accountable.\u201d The international criminal court (ICC) is currently carrying out its own preliminary inquiry into whether the deaths in Duterte\u2019s drug war, beginning when he was mayor of the Philippine city of Davao in 1988, constitute crimes against humanity, the first investigation the court has done into a southeast Asian country. The ICC defines crimes against humanity as \u201cserious violations committed as part of a large-scale attack against any civilian population\u201d. The announcement of the inquiry enraged Duterte so much that he withdrew the Philippines from the Rome Statute, which gives the ICC jurisdiction over the country, but the court is still continuing its investigations.",

The current cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, is seen as favourite but the Mail on Sunday leak story points in another direction. The story was written by Isabel Oakeshott, who is close to Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party. Farage, who boasts a close friendship with Trump, lobbied for the Washington job in 2016 and would benefit from the leak, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/07/leak-of-uk-ambassadors-us-telegrams-plays-into-wider-power-struggle\">according to our diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour</a>.

      "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018We are not big fans,\u2019 says Trump of UK envoy Good morning briefers. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories this Monday morning. Donald Trump has hit back after leaked memos revealed that the UK\u2019s ambassador to Washington briefed Whitehall that the White House administration was \u201cinept and dysfunctional\u201d. As a Foreign Office investigation begins into who leaked the confidential telegrams, Trump said Kim Darroch had \u201cnot served the UK well\u201d. He added: \u201cWe are not big fans of that man \u2026 I can say things about him, but I won\u2019t bother.\u201d At home, the sensational leaks were also helping to shed light on the power struggle within the Conservative party and who the next prime minister might appoint to the plum post when Darroch stands down, as he is due to, at the end of the year. The current cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, is seen as favourite but the Mail on Sunday leak story points in another direction. The story was written by Isabel Oakeshott, who is close to Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party. Farage, who boasts a close friendship with Trump, lobbied for the Washington job in 2016 and would benefit from the leak, according to our diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour. Farage was also one of the voices in the Mail piece calling for Darroch\u2019s immediate resignation. * * * \u2018Match fit for Brexit\u2019 \u2013 Brexit continues to be the main event in the Tory hustings with frontrunner Boris Johnson saying he would make sure Britain was \u201cmatch fit\u201d to leave the EU on 31 October \u201ccome what may\u201d. Former candidate Rory Stewart outlined plans for an \u201calternative parliament\u201d to stop a no-deal Brexit, while more than 30 Tory remainers are ready to force a vote on the Northern Ireland bill to stop the next prime minister proroguing parliament in the autumn. Labour is not free of Brexit woes either with shadow chancellor John McDonnell denying reports that he has urged Jeremy Corbyn to sack his anti-remain advisers. Business is worried too: the CBI says investment has plummeted amid fear of no deal. * * * Pensioned off \u2013 Consultants have begun working to rule in a standoff over NHS pensions, forcing hospitals to cancel operations and leaving cancer scans unread for weeks. Doctors say the dispute could send NHS services \u201cinto meltdown\u201d and is so serious that it poses a threat to the whole health service. A change to pension rules in 2016 mean that some consultants are receiving tax bills of as much as \u00a380,000. They fear that if they work more than their usual hours they will be financially worse off. NHS executives are concerned that waiting lists for non-urgent care such as a hip replacement or hernia repair, which already stands at 4.4 million, could balloon towards 5 million because the dispute. The Royal Bournemouth hospital in Dorset may have to cancel scores of operations in the next two weeks because its anaesthetists are refusing to work extra hours. * * * Capital killings \u2013 Police in London have launched a fourth murder investigation of the weekend after a man in his 20s died of head injuries in Wembley. It follows the the shooting dead of a man in his 30s in the same area on Friday night. Insp Sammi Elsituri said: \u201cWe will work relentlessly \u2013 day and night \u2013 to identify and pursue the culprits, bring them to justice, and take weapons off the streets to keep our communities safe.\u201d The body of a woman was found in Blackheath on Friday evening and a man in his 20s who was shot in Leyton early on Sunday morning. * * * \u2018Beautiful fight begins\u2019 \u2013 Kyriakos Mitsotakis will be sworn in as the new prime minister of Greece today after his centre-right New Democracy party comfortably won the country\u2019s election. The victory of the Harvard-educated banker spells the end of Alexis Tsipras\u2019s tumultuous four years in office as the country struggled through a crippling financial crisis. With more than 90% of votes counted, New Democracy party had 39.8% of the votes, compared with 31.5% for Tsipras\u2019 leftwing Syriza party. \u201cI asked for a strong mandate to change Greece. You offered it generously,\u201d Mitsotakis, the son of a former prime minister, said in his victory speech. \u201cFrom today, a difficult but beautiful fight begins.\u201d * * * \u2018Afronaut\u2019 dies \u2013 A South African man who pipped a million other candidates to be selected as the first black African to go into space has died in a motorbike crash. Mandla Maseko, a part-time DJ, was nicknamed \u201cAfronaut\u201d after winning a coveted seat to fly 103km (64 miles) into space in a competition organised by a US-based space academy. Today in Focus podcast: What happens to your recycling? Recycling is often cited as one of the easiest ways to make a difference to the environment. But does old plastic really get reprocessed into new? Guardian reporters around the world have been investigating what really happens to our waste. Lunchtime read: Why Arabella Weir enjoys mother of all laughs \u201cI take my shit and make it funny,\u201d says the comedian Arabella Weir, which is a neat summation of her first-ever one-woman show beginning next month at the Edinburgh fringe. More specifically, the show unpicks her relationship with her \u201caggressively unhappy\u201d mother who spent much of her life \u2013 and even time on her death bed \u2013 haranguing her daughter for being overweight. Weir, whose famous catchphrase on The Fast Show was \u201cDoes my bum look big in this?\u201d, tells Emine Saner how she has used her difficult childhood for her stage show. \u201cI developed a very acute sense of humour that would make a joke out of anything.\u201d The show, Does My Mum Loom Big In This?, is at the Assembly George Square Studios from 12 to 25 August. Sport Megan Rapinoe called for the conversation on equal pay to move forward after she helped USA to retain the World Cup with a 2-0 win over a disheartened Netherlands side, Rose Lavelle scoring the other goal. Donald Trump tweeted his congratulations, despite his confrontation with Rapinoe, noting the team\u2019s \u201cgreat and exciting play\u201d. At Wimbledon, Andy Murray sees no reason why he cannot still beat Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer as he continues a comeback that looked out of the question not long ago. Johanna Konta, who faces Petra Kvitova in the fourth round today, says it is an honour to play the Czech, who survived a horrific knife attack two and a half years ago. Phil Neville has shown his growing vexation with the new handball rules after England\u2019s play-off defeat at the Women\u2019s World Cup. And Brazil ended a 12-year wait to win the Copa Am\u00e9rica after a first-half goal from Gabriel Jesus and a late Richarlison penalty helped see off Peru 3-1 in Rio.

      "bodyText": "The All Blacks head coach has been called out for saying that domestic violence is not a gendered issue after he named a player who pleaded guilty to assaulting his partner in his side. Steve Hansen, a former police constable, made the comments after putting Canterbury Crusaders winger Sevu Reece in the latest All Blacks\u2019 squad. Reece pleaded guilty last year to a count of male assaults female, which is a crime most often used with family violence-related assaults, in the Hamilton district court. However, he was discharged without conviction after a judge ruled that it would have a detrimental effect on his rugby career. The then 21-year-old had signed a contract with the Irish club Connacht, but the club tore up the contract because of the charge. He has been playing with the Christchurch Crusaders and Hansen told the New Zealand Herald that Reece had \u201cflourished\u201d and become a \u201cbetter person\u201d during his time at the club. Hansen told Radio Sport that Reece made a mistake but had been through the right process. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to remove him out of it and say, look there\u2019s been a domestic violence incident, do we agree with it? No, we don\u2019t,\u201d said Hansen. \u201cDoes the New Zealand Rugby Union? No, they don\u2019t. Do the Crusaders? No, they don\u2019t. \u201cBut, it\u2019s a big part of our society unfortunately. So, rugby is going to have people within its community that are involved in this.\u201d Hansen said, having been a policeman he had seen a lot of domestic violence and that it was not just restricted to men assaulting women.

If you\u2019re pro-life then for these kids who are born, you provide service \u2013 you provide services for the mothers, you provide healthcare, you provide childcare. Because having the baby is the easy part. It\u2019s taking care and maintaining that child and making sure that they\u2019re in the right environment to prosper that\u2019s the bigger concern. So I feel that hypocrisy, from where I sit, because many of those people [who voted for this ban] vote against services to the same people.</p> <p>They kept talking about life, but those same people voted against every time they had an opportunity to give women additional money. Fair wages, or just bringing up the minimum wages, because many of the minimum-wage workers are women, they\u2019re single mothers who are working two jobs to make ends meet for the very babies that they want them to keep.</p> <p>This won\u2019t reduce abortions; it will reduce safe abortions. It\u2019s disrespectful of people\u2019s rights, of people\u2019s bodies.</p> <p>I just keep saying to people that they need to go register to vote and go out like never before and un-elect some of these people, and ask the hard questions while they\u2019re running: what will you do in terms of women\u2019s rights and their bodies? Do you believe that the majority of the people will support that? The many women I\u2019ve heard from, I just don\u2019t think that they support that.</p> <h2><strong>Senator Vivian Figures, Alabama</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"a3da86945bf715ff06bb8f2a2f2b87827ed8676c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3da86945bf715ff06bb8f2a2f2b87827ed8676c/0_0_4000_1657/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alabama Senator Vivian Figures in Montgomery, Alabama, on 20 June 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"414\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alabama Senator Vivian Figures in Montgomery, Alabama, on 20 June 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julie Bennett/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Vivian Figures.

To at least put themselves in the shoes of women, or even their female family members, to show them that this bill shouldn\u2019t pass and how bad it was. I tried to do that in different ways \u2013 with the three amendments that I offered, that I knew would fail because we were told they didn\u2019t want any amendments on this bill.</p> <p>The first amendment was to expand Medicaid, because once this is enacted into law in mid-November, it\u2019s going to affect women who are low-income more than anything. Therefore, they will need the medical coverage for those potentially unsafe abortions that they\u2019re going to try to still have.</p> <p>My second amendment had to do with all of the money \u2013 the potential millions of dollars that Alabama will have to come up with to pay legal fees to fight this unconstitutional bill in the courts. And my third amendment \u2013 and I said I saved the best for last \u2013 was actually to make it a felony when men got a vasectomy. That\u2019s cutting off life, wouldn\u2019t you think? For them to make it a felony for a doctor to give a woman an abortion, then they should receive the same treatment.</p> <p>Many of the people who are voting to ban abortions will still have access because they will have the means to send the women in their lives to some place that has legal, safe abortions. So why shouldn\u2019t it be available for all women?</p> <h2><strong>Representative Doug Beck, Missouri</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7d5a28bde6a297cb9ae31f6249a1a3c66e29c96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7d5a28bde6a297cb9ae31f6249a1a3c66e29c96/0_0_2336_3500/667.jpg\" alt=\"Missouri State Rep.

A lot of women decide that they can\u2019t afford to have a family right now. That\u2019s one of their decisions they have to make. I think it takes power away from women if we don\u2019t let them make their own choices.</p> <p>The bill \u2013 with the rape and incest and all those things in there \u2013 I think it\u2019s barbaric. I knew [Governor Mike Parson] was going to sign it anyway. The problem with this state is that we\u2019re a super-minority as far as Democrats go. And they feel like they can do a lot of different things and nothing happens because we keep electing these people. Personally, I think there were people on the other side of the aisle who probably wanted to vote no on this but they felt that with the political pressure, they couldn\u2019t.</p> <p>The way I look at this entire issue is that it\u2019s putting women as second-class citizens, less than men \u2013 which it\u2019s been for a long time, anyway. I think [men] should be speaking up and saying this is wrong. That\u2019s the way I see it, but then again I don\u2019t want to step in to the point where I\u2019m telling a woman how she should feel. It\u2019s kind of a sticky area sometimes. But I think anytime we talk about LGBTQ rights, abortion \u2013 it\u2019s all the same issue. It\u2019s all about just people having the exact same rights that I have. And it\u2019s about human rights.</p> <h2><strong>Representative Stephanie Howse, Ohio</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"9e6eedf1e91ec584cdba7ba3a8cb1381842b4bc2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e6eedf1e91ec584cdba7ba3a8cb1381842b4bc2/0_0_7327_3314/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rep.

Break it down even further, and it\u2019s Christian-based white men. You can look through our history to see what that one voice has done to our country at different moments in time \u2013 to take over ownership and control of other people\u2019s bodies, based on what they believe.</p> <p>Look at the money that\u2019s being spent on this versus putting our time and energy for what people actually want. We\u2019re talking about equitably funding education, really providing true affordable and accessible healthcare to all or our citizens, ensuring that families have the ability to have family-sustaining wages \u2013 those are the real issues that people want, that are impacting their daily lives.</p> <p>Fundamentally, you can\u2019t expect the system that, for the most part, was not designed for the people of 2019 and beyond, to cater to your needs. It\u2019s still designed to benefit white men who own stuff.</p> <p>Here in Ohio, we\u2019ve started the Black Maternal Health Caucus, to fight back and begin to look at the health and wellness of black women, because when we talk about total abortion bans, we know the real life-and-death situations we are putting black women in. Having a caucus that can come together and look at the policies that we can introduce and champion so that we can be protectors of black women, black babies and black families, is one of the things that we\u2019re doing and could be a strategy for other communities.</p>",

Photograph by Akasha Rabut/The Guardian C Denise Marcelle, who has represented East Baton Rouge in the Louisiana house of representatives since 2015, testified against the state\u2019s six-week ban in May. Many of the people who say they\u2019re pro-life really aren\u2019t pro-life, in my opinion. If you\u2019re pro-life then for these kids who are born, you provide service \u2013 you provide services for the mothers, you provide healthcare, you provide childcare. Because having the baby is the easy part. It\u2019s taking care and maintaining that child and making sure that they\u2019re in the right environment to prosper that\u2019s the bigger concern. So I feel that hypocrisy, from where I sit, because many of those people [who voted for this ban] vote against services to the same people. They kept talking about life, but those same people voted against every time they had an opportunity to give women additional money. Fair wages, or just bringing up the minimum wages, because many of the minimum-wage workers are women, they\u2019re single mothers who are working two jobs to make ends meet for the very babies that they want them to keep. This won\u2019t reduce abortions; it will reduce safe abortions. It\u2019s disrespectful of people\u2019s rights, of people\u2019s bodies. I just keep saying to people that they need to go register to vote and go out like never before and un-elect some of these people, and ask the hard questions while they\u2019re running: what will you do in terms of women\u2019s rights and their bodies? Do you believe that the majority of the people will support that? The many women I\u2019ve heard from, I just don\u2019t think that they support that. Senator Vivian Figures, Alabama Vivian Figures. Photograph by Julie Bennett/The Guardian. Vivian Davis Figures, of Mobile, has served in the Alabama state senate since 1997. She opposed Alabama\u2019s near-total abortion ban on the senate floor, and will be honorary chair of Galvanize Alabama, a United State of Women community day of action, in September. My goal was, first of all, trying to get my Republican male colleagues to empathize. To at least put themselves in the shoes of women, or even their female family members, to show them that this bill shouldn\u2019t pass and how bad it was. I tried to do that in different ways \u2013 with the three amendments that I offered, that I knew would fail because we were told they didn\u2019t want any amendments on this bill. The first amendment was to expand Medicaid, because once this is enacted into law in mid-November, it\u2019s going to affect women who are low-income more than anything. Therefore, they will need the medical coverage for those potentially unsafe abortions that they\u2019re going to try to still have. My second amendment had to do with all of the money \u2013 the potential millions of dollars that Alabama will have to come up with to pay legal fees to fight this unconstitutional bill in the courts. And my third amendment \u2013 and I said I saved the best for last \u2013 was actually to make it a felony when men got a vasectomy. That\u2019s cutting off life, wouldn\u2019t you think? For them to make it a felony for a doctor to give a woman an abortion, then they should receive the same treatment. Many of the people who are voting to ban abortions will still have access because they will have the means to send the women in their lives to some place that has legal, safe abortions. So why shouldn\u2019t it be available for all women? Representative Doug Beck, Missouri Doug Beck. Photograph by Neeta Satam/The Guardian Doug Beck, of St Louis, was elected to the Missouri house of representatives in November 2016. He spoke against Missouri\u2019s eight-week ban in May, and works in construction when not in session. I don\u2019t really call it abortion, I call it women\u2019s healthcare \u2013 being able to choose your own healthcare. A lot of women decide that they can\u2019t afford to have a family right now. That\u2019s one of their decisions they have to make. I think it takes power away from women if we don\u2019t let them make their own choices. The bill \u2013 with the rape and incest and all those things in there \u2013 I think it\u2019s barbaric. I knew [Governor Mike Parson] was going to sign it anyway. The problem with this state is that we\u2019re a super-minority as far as Democrats go. And they feel like they can do a lot of different things and nothing happens because we keep electing these people. Personally, I think there were people on the other side of the aisle who probably wanted to vote no on this but they felt that with the political pressure, they couldn\u2019t. The way I look at this entire issue is that it\u2019s putting women as second-class citizens, less than men \u2013 which it\u2019s been for a long time, anyway. I think [men] should be speaking up and saying this is wrong. That\u2019s the way I see it, but then again I don\u2019t want to step in to the point where I\u2019m telling a woman how she should feel. It\u2019s kind of a sticky area sometimes. But I think anytime we talk about LGBTQ rights, abortion \u2013 it\u2019s all the same issue. It\u2019s all about just people having the exact same rights that I have. And it\u2019s about human rights. Representative Stephanie Howse, Ohio Stephanie Howse. Photographs by Maddie McGarvey/The Guardian Stephanie Howse, of Cleveland, has represented the 11th district in Ohio\u2019s house of representatives since 2014 and spoke against the state\u2019s six-week ban in November 2018. A larger point we need to understand is that this is still a patriarchal society, and when you look at the gender breakdown of who is making these decisions, it\u2019s overwhelmingly men. Break it down even further, and it\u2019s Christian-based white men. You can look through our history to see what that one voice has done to our country at different moments in time \u2013 to take over ownership and control of other people\u2019s bodies, based on what they believe. Look at the money that\u2019s being spent on this versus putting our time and energy for what people actually want. We\u2019re talking about equitably funding education, really providing true affordable and accessible healthcare to all or our citizens, ensuring that families have the ability to have family-sustaining wages \u2013 those are the real issues that people want, that are impacting their daily lives. Fundamentally, you can\u2019t expect the system that, for the most part, was not designed for the people of 2019 and beyond, to cater to your needs. It\u2019s still designed to benefit white men who own stuff. Here in Ohio, we\u2019ve started the Black Maternal Health Caucus, to fight back and begin to look at the health and wellness of black women, because when we talk about total abortion bans, we know the real life-and-death situations we are putting black women in. Having a caucus that can come together and look at the policies that we can introduce and champion so that we can be protectors of black women, black babies and black families, is one of the things that we\u2019re doing and could be a strategy for other communities.",

      "body": "<p>Even close to the end of her life, Arabella Weir\u2019s mother was still concerned about her daughter\u2019s weight. \u201cLiterally two days before she died,\u201d says Weir, with a grim laugh. \u201cI said: \u2018You\u2019re dying and you\u2019re worried about how fat I am?\u2019 She went: \u2018Oh God, look at you, though.\u2019 And I said: \u2018We\u2019re not doing this shit now.\u2019 And she didn\u2019t back down, nor did she apologise.\u201d Ten years on, there is revenge of sorts \u2013 or catharsis, or a kind of exorcism, or merely some giddy laughter that comes from the triumph of surviving such a dysfunctional childhood. Weir is now going to Edinburgh with her one-woman show, in which she unpicks \u2013 or rather picks at \u2013 her childhood and her relationship with her mother.</p> <p>The show is called Does My Mum Loom Big in This?, which fans of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/nov/13/fast-show-sketches-best-return\" title=\"\">90s BBC comedy sketch series The Fast Show</a> will recognise as a play on one of her character\u2019s catchphrases, \u201cDoes my bum look big in this?\u201d That also became the title of her bestselling book. It seems as if Weir has been a fixture in British comedy for decades \u2013 she was also in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2003/feb/09/foodanddrink.features\" title=\"\">spoof cookery show Posh Nosh</a>, which she co-wrote \u2013 and she has worked steadily in dramas and sitcoms, including the BBC Two series Two Doors Down. But this is her first one-woman show, co-written with the novelist Jon Canter, and the first time she has performed at the Edinburgh fringe; she will be taking it on tour next year. It feels like the right time, she says. Both of her children are at university. \u201cThere\u2019s a been a sort of: \u2018Oh right, so it\u2019s just me now. So what am I going to do?\u2019\u201d says Weir, who is 61. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be watching Judge Judy all day, which I could very easily do.\u201d</p> <p>Her show is funny, she insists several times, when we meet at her home in north London; she\u2019s worried it might sound grim and self-pitying. \u201cI take my shit and make it funny,\u201d she says. That was how she survived. \u201cI developed a very acute sense of humour that would make a joke out of anything.\u201d And she is excellent company \u2013 funny, with a gift for easy intimacy, and eager to be entertaining.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f00e8a7aa2a2d2959f00ffb3642771b167b73d3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f00e8a7aa2a2d2959f00ffb3642771b167b73d3d/0_0_3613_2408/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Charlie Higson in The Fast Show.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Charlie Higson in The Fast Show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tyson Benton/BBC/Down The Line Productions Ltd/Tyson Benton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Did she always want to write about her mother? \u201cYes, I think so,\u201d she says, slouching in an armchair with her legs slung over the side. \u201cThe way I have recovered, and what I did at the time, was to be combative. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/sep/04/arabella-weir-eating-disorders-parents-love\" title=\"\">Experiencing the neglect and emotional abuse I did</a>, at the time I was constantly saying: \u2018Why are you doing this, why are you saying this, why can\u2019t I eat, what\u2019s wrong with the way I look?\u2019 and that\u2019s what my mother found so difficult. Looking back, I think that is why I am who I am and I\u2019ve written the stuff I\u2019ve done. In a way, my combativeness was my saving grace and the thing that kept me buoyant.\u201d</p> <p>Weir was born in the US, where her father, Sir Michael Weir, a diplomat, was posted, then the family lived in Cairo before moving to London when Weir was about seven. Her parents separated a few years later and she was brought up by her mother, Alison, with her two older brothers and younger sister (she has talked to them about her show, but she\u2019s not expecting them to come and see it). \u201cThe thing I was very aware of was she was much more aggressive with me than she was with my siblings. She said: \u2018That\u2019s because you\u2019re more annoying than anyone else.\u2019 She often used to say that.\u201d When she was about nine, Weir was sent to live with her father in Bahrain, while her siblings remained in the UK. \u201cIn my memory, she got rid of me \u2013 and I\u2019m afraid pretty much that\u2019s what happened.\u201d</p> <p>Although she says this gave her a bond with her father, he was emotionally reserved, and when he moved to New York \u2013 and Weir was sent back to her mother \u2013 the children would only see him during the school holidays. \u201cHe was a pretty remote figure,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were both absolutely classic Scots: chin up, grin and bear it, never put yourself first, don\u2019t complain.\u201d</p> <p>Alison was obviously unhappy, but aggressively so, says Weir. One of her memories, from when she was about seven or eight, is when her mother \u201ccompletely lost it because I couldn\u2019t tell the time. She said: \u2018We are not leaving this fucking house until you can.\u2019 I remember thinking I\u2019ve got to guess right because I had no idea how to read the time. Then I remember thinking I was frightened of her.\u201d</p> <p>Weir yearned, she says, for her mother to be \u201cordinary\u201d.<strong> </strong>The first time she realised she had to look out for herself was when she was about eight and she asked her mother what there was for supper. \u201cHow the fuck should I know?\u201d was Alison\u2019s reply, and when you don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to get fed, says Weir, \u201cyou get panicky about food\u201d. To her parents\u2019 disappointment \u2013 they thought girls should be thin and pretty \u2013 she was naturally rounded, made worse by disordered eating. Her meals, when they appeared, were monitored. \u201c[My mother] went in for: \u2018You can\u2019t eat that \u2013 you\u2019re fat.\u2019 My brothers were eating it and she would say: \u2018They\u2019re boys.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Was Alison ever kind to her? Weir thinks for a while. \u201cWe could have a laugh together but she was always critical. When she was ill and dying, I would read from the London Review of Books and those would be nice moments, but if I pronounced somebody\u2019s name wrong there would be five minutes of: \u2018I can\u2019t believe you thought her name was \u2026\u2019 If she could get the jab in, she\u2019d do it. She wasn\u2019t kind.\u201d</p> <p>Alison had been brought up in the Scottish borders, the only child of emotionally repressed intellectuals. Her father was the headmaster of a small boys\u2019 boarding school, where it wasn\u2019t unusual for the pupils not to see their parents for years. \u201cMum was essentially brought up as one of the boy pupils, and not as their child,\u201d says Weir. \u201cHer parents said to her: \u2018You are not to feel special.\u2019 She was, I think, quite badly neglected. Her mother, within earshot, would apologise to her father that she was a girl.\u201d</p> <p>She was bright and got into Oxford, where she met Weir\u2019s father. \u201cThere were these women of that class, expected to go to university and do brilliantly and then expected to be diplomats\u2019 wives. What was the point of educating them if they were just going to have to look nice in a cocktail dress?\u201d Forced into taking on virtually all of the domestic work, Alison rejected it. She considered cooking \u201cbeneath her\u201d, says Weir. \u201cHer favourite thing was: \u2018That\u2019s just so fucking bourgeois.\u2019 You\u2019d go: \u2018Can we have something to eat?\u2019 and she\u2019d go: \u2018Don\u2019t be so fucking bourgeois.\u2019 It is funny looking back, but it was crazy and it was frightening at the time, and there was no stability. She was very grand and incredibly bright and she just thought anything domestic was beneath her intellect and beneath her socially.\u201d She was funny and witty, very well-read, \u201ctotally without inhibitions\u201d, says Weir. Essentially, \u201cshe was my child. What she\u2019d created was a person who was able to mother her. She sort of said that towards the end, although she did not express any gratitude.\u201d She did, however, admit that, as a parent, she didn\u2019t have a clue what she was doing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3f80027fde8f5e288931c5ff0ebebc2663d31de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3f80027fde8f5e288931c5ff0ebebc2663d31de/0_0_1661_1684/986.jpg\" alt=\"With Richard E Grant in Posh Nosh.\" width=\"986\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Richard E Grant in Posh Nosh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Moyes/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alison became a teacher at Camden School for Girls in north London, which Weir attended. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/jul/03/arabella-weir-once-upon-a-life\" title=\"\">She says she became the school rebel</a> \u2013 brave and hilarious \u2013 mainly to embarrass her mother. \u201cIt was revenge. And I was very pleased.\u201d But it also had the added effect of making Weir popular \u2013 which at the time she desperately needed. \u201cI remember thinking I am going to be the funniest, most popular person and I don\u2019t care what it takes.\u201d She smiles. \u201cWhat it took was not to get any O-levels.\u201d</p> <p>Performing suited her. After studying drama at North Middlesex polytechnic, she took temping jobs between small acting roles until getting her break on The Fast Show. She was in her mid-30s before she started earning a living from acting. Were her parents proud? She smiles grimly. Her mother, she says, \u201cdidn\u2019t watch what I did, and if she did, she\u2019d go on about how brilliant somebody else was \u2013 usually a man\u201d.</p> <p>She likens working in TV in the 80s and 90s to working on a building site. \u201cPeople would talk about your tits in a \u2018jokey\u2019 way,\u201d she says. \u201cNot usually the cast, but maybe. The sparks and all these guys \u2026 someone would shout: \u2018Oi, seen the new one with the big tits?\u2019 and if you went: \u2018Erm, guys?\u2019 they would go: \u2018You\u2019re not one of those women\u2019s libbers, are you?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>None of the #MeToo revelations came as much of a surprise to Weir. \u201cGiven that men go about saying disgusting things to you on the tube and the bus, why isn\u2019t someone who has actual power over you going to be guilty of the same shit? If you are a man with not-great attitudes to women but you want power over women, what better to be than a film producer or a TV director?\u201d</p> <p>On one job, a well-known actor locked Weir in his dressing room. She pauses. \u201cAnd another very well-known actor, and another one. God, there were loads. They were obviously men with, at the very least, a sense of entitlement. To be fair to at least two of them, there was no question of them forcing themselves on me once I had gone: \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 But it was always: \u2018I thought you were a fun girl, but if you\u2019re going to be like this.\u2019 It was about what was wrong with me; there was certainly no \u2018I\u2019m so sorry \u2013 I misread the situation\u2019.\u201d One man did get aggressive, she says, when she turned him down. \u201cI did think: \u2018I\u2019m in real trouble here.\u2019 Then somebody knocked on the door to say my ride home had arrived.\u201d She rarely complained. \u201cWho would you have gone to? I was on one thing where someone behaved very inappropriately and I told the producer, and he went: \u2018Oh yeah, he\u2019s a bit of a twat,\u2019 and that was it.\u201d</p> <p>She brought a feminist slant to The Fast Show \u2013 memorably with the Invisible Woman character, whose ideas are <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE3r_CgScms\" title=\"\">ignored by the men who then pass them off as their own</a>. Behind the scenes, she felt she was making a stand for working mothers. \u201cI mean, I wasn\u2019t Germaine Greer, but I remember thinking: \u2018They can\u2019t get rid of me, and I\u2019ve just had a baby and she\u2019s coming with me,\u2019\u201d she says. Her daughter (now 21; she also has a son who is 20) was born around the time of the show\u2019s live tour. \u201cI was very lucky because I was in a job where my friends were the producers, but I just took her with me and breastfed her in front of everyone. I remember thinking: \u2018I\u2019m going to do whatever I want, and I\u2019m going to take this baby everywhere, because there are women who can\u2019t do this and I will blaze the trail.\u2019 I felt very gladiatorial about it.\u201d</p> <p>Despite her relationship with her mother, Weir says she was \u201cabsolutely desperate to be a mother. I have made it my life\u2019s work to do the opposite of everything my mother did and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/sep/03/publicschools.schools\" title=\"\">be the best possible mother I can be</a>.\u201d On the whole, she thinks, she has succeeded, though part of her show is about her own shortcomings as a parent. What has been her biggest failure? She thinks for a minute then says with a smile: \u201cThey cannot bear it that I like Drake [the rapper]. They don\u2019t like me dancing. I think they find me \u2026 I don\u2019t believe a mother has to be self-effacing, but they might have liked it if I wasn\u2019t quite so: \u2018Wheee, look at me!\u2019 But I think they like me.\u201d</p> <p>Has she forgiven her mother? \u201cOh yes,\u201d she says, then: \u201cForgiven \u2013 is that the right word?\u201d Reached a level of understanding? Weir nods. \u201cI made it my business to understand her childhood and the context for women of that generation, and how hard it was for them. Add into that someone who was not maternal anyway. She would probably have much more support now. I understand her, but I think she was too bright and too privileged not to have done something about it. But she wasn\u2019t interested in changing.\u201d</p> <p>Mother-daughter relationships are endlessly complex \u2013 that was why she wanted to write about it. \u201cI hope the show is funny and real and has some messages about parenting and being a woman, and the things that are still true from my mother\u2019s generation to mine and after.\u201d Remarkably, these days she thinks about her mother with fondness. \u201cI made my peace with her.\u201d</p> <p><em>Does My Mum Loom Big in This? is at </em><a href=\"https://edinburghfestival.list.co.uk/event/1271913-arabella-weir-does-my-mum-loom-big-in-this/\" title=\"\"><em>the Assembly George Square Studios</em></a><em>, Edinburgh, from 12 to 25 August. </em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Even close to the end of her life, Arabella Weir\u2019s mother was still concerned about her daughter\u2019s weight. \u201cLiterally two days before she died,\u201d says Weir, with a grim laugh. \u201cI said: \u2018You\u2019re dying and you\u2019re worried about how fat I am?\u2019 She went: \u2018Oh God, look at you, though.\u2019 And I said: \u2018We\u2019re not doing this shit now.\u2019 And she didn\u2019t back down, nor did she apologise.\u201d Ten years on, there is revenge of sorts \u2013 or catharsis, or a kind of exorcism, or merely some giddy laughter that comes from the triumph of surviving such a dysfunctional childhood. Weir is now going to Edinburgh with her one-woman show, in which she unpicks \u2013 or rather picks at \u2013 her childhood and her relationship with her mother. The show is called Does My Mum Loom Big in This?, which fans of the 90s BBC comedy sketch series The Fast Show will recognise as a play on one of her character\u2019s catchphrases, \u201cDoes my bum look big in this?\u201d That also became the title of her bestselling book. It seems as if Weir has been a fixture in British comedy for decades \u2013 she was also in the spoof cookery show Posh Nosh, which she co-wrote \u2013 and she has worked steadily in dramas and sitcoms, including the BBC Two series Two Doors Down. But this is her first one-woman show, co-written with the novelist Jon Canter, and the first time she has performed at the Edinburgh fringe; she will be taking it on tour next year. It feels like the right time, she says. Both of her children are at university. \u201cThere\u2019s a been a sort of: \u2018Oh right, so it\u2019s just me now. So what am I going to do?\u2019\u201d says Weir, who is 61. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be watching Judge Judy all day, which I could very easily do.\u201d Her show is funny, she insists several times, when we meet at her home in north London; she\u2019s worried it might sound grim and self-pitying. \u201cI take my shit and make it funny,\u201d she says. That was how she survived. \u201cI developed a very acute sense of humour that would make a joke out of anything.\u201d And she is excellent company \u2013 funny, with a gift for easy intimacy, and eager to be entertaining. Did she always want to write about her mother? \u201cYes, I think so,\u201d she says, slouching in an armchair with her legs slung over the side. \u201cThe way I have recovered, and what I did at the time, was to be combative. Experiencing the neglect and emotional abuse I did, at the time I was constantly saying: \u2018Why are you doing this, why are you saying this, why can\u2019t I eat, what\u2019s wrong with the way I look?\u2019 and that\u2019s what my mother found so difficult. Looking back, I think that is why I am who I am and I\u2019ve written the stuff I\u2019ve done. In a way, my combativeness was my saving grace and the thing that kept me buoyant.\u201d Weir was born in the US, where her father, Sir Michael Weir, a diplomat, was posted, then the family lived in Cairo before moving to London when Weir was about seven. Her parents separated a few years later and she was brought up by her mother, Alison, with her two older brothers and younger sister (she has talked to them about her show, but she\u2019s not expecting them to come and see it). \u201cThe thing I was very aware of was she was much more aggressive with me than she was with my siblings. She said: \u2018That\u2019s because you\u2019re more annoying than anyone else.\u2019 She often used to say that.\u201d When she was about nine, Weir was sent to live with her father in Bahrain, while her siblings remained in the UK. \u201cIn my memory, she got rid of me \u2013 and I\u2019m afraid pretty much that\u2019s what happened.\u201d Although she says this gave her a bond with her father, he was emotionally reserved, and when he moved to New York \u2013 and Weir was sent back to her mother \u2013 the children would only see him during the school holidays. \u201cHe was a pretty remote figure,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were both absolutely classic Scots: chin up, grin and bear it, never put yourself first, don\u2019t complain.\u201d Alison was obviously unhappy, but aggressively so, says Weir. One of her memories, from when she was about seven or eight, is when her mother \u201ccompletely lost it because I couldn\u2019t tell the time. She said: \u2018We are not leaving this fucking house until you can.\u2019 I remember thinking I\u2019ve got to guess right because I had no idea how to read the time. Then I remember thinking I was frightened of her.\u201d Weir yearned, she says, for her mother to be \u201cordinary\u201d. The first time she realised she had to look out for herself was when she was about eight and she asked her mother what there was for supper. \u201cHow the fuck should I know?\u201d was Alison\u2019s reply, and when you don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to get fed, says Weir, \u201cyou get panicky about food\u201d. To her parents\u2019 disappointment \u2013 they thought girls should be thin and pretty \u2013 she was naturally rounded, made worse by disordered eating. Her meals, when they appeared, were monitored. \u201c[My mother] went in for: \u2018You can\u2019t eat that \u2013 you\u2019re fat.\u2019 My brothers were eating it and she would say: \u2018They\u2019re boys.\u2019\u201d Was Alison ever kind to her? Weir thinks for a while. \u201cWe could have a laugh together but she was always critical. When she was ill and dying, I would read from the London Review of Books and those would be nice moments, but if I pronounced somebody\u2019s name wrong there would be five minutes of: \u2018I can\u2019t believe you thought her name was \u2026\u2019 If she could get the jab in, she\u2019d do it. She wasn\u2019t kind.\u201d Alison had been brought up in the Scottish borders, the only child of emotionally repressed intellectuals. Her father was the headmaster of a small boys\u2019 boarding school, where it wasn\u2019t unusual for the pupils not to see their parents for years. \u201cMum was essentially brought up as one of the boy pupils, and not as their child,\u201d says Weir. \u201cHer parents said to her: \u2018You are not to feel special.\u2019 She was, I think, quite badly neglected. Her mother, within earshot, would apologise to her father that she was a girl.\u201d She was bright and got into Oxford, where she met Weir\u2019s father. \u201cThere were these women of that class, expected to go to university and do brilliantly and then expected to be diplomats\u2019 wives. What was the point of educating them if they were just going to have to look nice in a cocktail dress?\u201d Forced into taking on virtually all of the domestic work, Alison rejected it. She considered cooking \u201cbeneath her\u201d, says Weir. \u201cHer favourite thing was: \u2018That\u2019s just so fucking bourgeois.\u2019 You\u2019d go: \u2018Can we have something to eat?\u2019 and she\u2019d go: \u2018Don\u2019t be so fucking bourgeois.\u2019 It is funny looking back, but it was crazy and it was frightening at the time, and there was no stability. She was very grand and incredibly bright and she just thought anything domestic was beneath her intellect and beneath her socially.\u201d She was funny and witty, very well-read, \u201ctotally without inhibitions\u201d, says Weir. Essentially, \u201cshe was my child. What she\u2019d created was a person who was able to mother her. She sort of said that towards the end, although she did not express any gratitude.\u201d She did, however, admit that, as a parent, she didn\u2019t have a clue what she was doing. Alison became a teacher at Camden School for Girls in north London, which Weir attended. She says she became the school rebel \u2013 brave and hilarious \u2013 mainly to embarrass her mother. \u201cIt was revenge. And I was very pleased.\u201d But it also had the added effect of making Weir popular \u2013 which at the time she desperately needed. \u201cI remember thinking I am going to be the funniest, most popular person and I don\u2019t care what it takes.\u201d She smiles. \u201cWhat it took was not to get any O-levels.\u201d Performing suited her. After studying drama at North Middlesex polytechnic, she took temping jobs between small acting roles until getting her break on The Fast Show. She was in her mid-30s before she started earning a living from acting. Were her parents proud? She smiles grimly. Her mother, she says, \u201cdidn\u2019t watch what I did, and if she did, she\u2019d go on about how brilliant somebody else was \u2013 usually a man\u201d. She likens working in TV in the 80s and 90s to working on a building site. \u201cPeople would talk about your tits in a \u2018jokey\u2019 way,\u201d she says. \u201cNot usually the cast, but maybe. The sparks and all these guys \u2026 someone would shout: \u2018Oi, seen the new one with the big tits?\u2019 and if you went: \u2018Erm, guys?\u2019 they would go: \u2018You\u2019re not one of those women\u2019s libbers, are you?\u2019\u201d None of the #MeToo revelations came as much of a surprise to Weir. \u201cGiven that men go about saying disgusting things to you on the tube and the bus, why isn\u2019t someone who has actual power over you going to be guilty of the same shit? If you are a man with not-great attitudes to women but you want power over women, what better to be than a film producer or a TV director?\u201d On one job, a well-known actor locked Weir in his dressing room. She pauses. \u201cAnd another very well-known actor, and another one. God, there were loads. They were obviously men with, at the very least, a sense of entitlement. To be fair to at least two of them, there was no question of them forcing themselves on me once I had gone: \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 But it was always: \u2018I thought you were a fun girl, but if you\u2019re going to be like this.\u2019 It was about what was wrong with me; there was certainly no \u2018I\u2019m so sorry \u2013 I misread the situation\u2019.\u201d One man did get aggressive, she says, when she turned him down. \u201cI did think: \u2018I\u2019m in real trouble here.\u2019 Then somebody knocked on the door to say my ride home had arrived.\u201d She rarely complained. \u201cWho would you have gone to? I was on one thing where someone behaved very inappropriately and I told the producer, and he went: \u2018Oh yeah, he\u2019s a bit of a twat,\u2019 and that was it.\u201d She brought a feminist slant to The Fast Show \u2013 memorably with the Invisible Woman character, whose ideas are ignored by the men who then pass them off as their own. Behind the scenes, she felt she was making a stand for working mothers. \u201cI mean, I wasn\u2019t Germaine Greer, but I remember thinking: \u2018They can\u2019t get rid of me, and I\u2019ve just had a baby and she\u2019s coming with me,\u2019\u201d she says. Her daughter (now 21; she also has a son who is 20) was born around the time of the show\u2019s live tour. \u201cI was very lucky because I was in a job where my friends were the producers, but I just took her with me and breastfed her in front of everyone. I remember thinking: \u2018I\u2019m going to do whatever I want, and I\u2019m going to take this baby everywhere, because there are women who can\u2019t do this and I will blaze the trail.\u2019 I felt very gladiatorial about it.\u201d Despite her relationship with her mother, Weir says she was \u201cabsolutely desperate to be a mother. I have made it my life\u2019s work to do the opposite of everything my mother did and be the best possible mother I can be.\u201d On the whole, she thinks, she has succeeded, though part of her show is about her own shortcomings as a parent. What has been her biggest failure? She thinks for a minute then says with a smile: \u201cThey cannot bear it that I like Drake [the rapper]. They don\u2019t like me dancing. I think they find me \u2026 I don\u2019t believe a mother has to be self-effacing, but they might have liked it if I wasn\u2019t quite so: \u2018Wheee, look at me!\u2019 But I think they like me.\u201d Has she forgiven her mother? \u201cOh yes,\u201d she says, then: \u201cForgiven \u2013 is that the right word?\u201d Reached a level of understanding? Weir nods. \u201cI made it my business to understand her childhood and the context for women of that generation, and how hard it was for them. Add into that someone who was not maternal anyway. She would probably have much more support now. I understand her, but I think she was too bright and too privileged not to have done something about it. But she wasn\u2019t interested in changing.\u201d Mother-daughter relationships are endlessly complex \u2013 that was why she wanted to write about it. \u201cI hope the show is funny and real and has some messages about parenting and being a woman, and the things that are still true from my mother\u2019s generation to mine and after.\u201d Remarkably, these days she thinks about her mother with fondness. \u201cI made my peace with her.\u201d Does My Mum Loom Big in This? is at the Assembly George Square Studios, Edinburgh, from 12 to 25 August.",

It is a place where the garbage is automatically sucked away through underground pipes, where lampposts are always watching you, and where your apartment block knows to send the elevator down to greet you when it detects the arrival of your car.

Across an eight-lane highway lies Central Park, a broad swath of trees surrounding an ornamental lake, flanked by rows of glass towers with vaguely jaunty silhouettes. Armies of identikit concrete apartment blocks march into the hazy distance beyond, terminating at a Jack Nicklaus-designed golf course. It looks a lot like many other modern Asian cities, a place of generic towers rising above a car-dominated grid.

At the turn of the 19th century, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2014/mar/17/ebbsfleet-garden-city-george-osborne\">Garden City movement</a> saw a generation of bucolic communities planned in reaction to the grime and overcrowding of rapidly industrialising cities, driven by a powerful campaign for social reform. Half a century later, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/may/15/sterile-or-stirring-britains-love-hate-relationship-with-new-towns\">New Town</a> movement developed these ideas, promising a brave new world of modern, self-sufficient municipalities rising from the ruins of the second world war, and focused on building an inclusive, democratic society.</p> \n<p>Now, in the first decades of a new millennium, a surge in global population growth and a sense of impending environmental armageddon have spurred an epidemic of planned cities of a very different kind. This time they are being conceived by private multinational corporations as gilt-edged gated communities and tax-exempt free-trade hubs, each branded as the ultimate techno-eco-utopia.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>These new cities are not for rural-urban migrants.

All these newly minted urbanites will need somewhere to live and work. Yet the vast majority of the newly planned cities are not being designed to house the coming tidal wave of rural-urban migrants.

      "bodyText": "At 8.30 every morning, an announcement is piped though a speaker in the ceiling of Kim Jong-won\u2019s apartment, barking the daily bulletin in a high-pitched voice. The disembodied broadcaster details new parking measures, issues with the pneumatic waste disposal chute and various building maintenance jobs to be carried out that day. \u201cThere\u2019s no way of turning it off,\u201d sighs Kim\u2019s wife, Jung-sim, as she prepares breakfast. \u201cI hate technology but my husband is an early adopter. He has to have everything first.\u201d It was Kim\u2019s love of the latest tech that prompted him move his family to the future, or the nearest thing to it \u2013 Songdo, South Korea\u2019s self-styled \u201csmart city\u201d, built on a 600-hectare parcel of artificial land dredged from the Yellow Sea near Seoul\u2019s Incheon airport. It is a place where the garbage is automatically sucked away through underground pipes, where lampposts are always watching you, and where your apartment block knows to send the elevator down to greet you when it detects the arrival of your car. Sensors in every street track traffic flow and send alerts to your phone when it\u2019s going to snow, while you can monitor the children\u2019s playground on TV from the comfort of your sofa. The feature Kim enjoys most is a small touchscreen display on his kitchen wall that allows him to keep track of his and his wife\u2019s consumption of electricity, water and gas and, most important, compare it against the average statistics for the building. Flicking between the screens of bar charts and graphs, a broad grin spreads across his face: for yet another day running, they are more energy-efficient than all their neighbours. From their living room window at the top of one of the city\u2019s new residential towers, a panorama of downtown Songdo unfolds. Across an eight-lane highway lies Central Park, a broad swath of trees surrounding an ornamental lake, flanked by rows of glass towers with vaguely jaunty silhouettes. Armies of identikit concrete apartment blocks march into the hazy distance beyond, terminating at a Jack Nicklaus-designed golf course. It looks a lot like many other modern Asian cities, a place of generic towers rising above a car-dominated grid. Public life is mostly confined to the air-conditioned environments of malls and private leisure clubs. Initiated by the South Korean government in the late 1990s, when Incheon airport was being planned, Songdo represents a model that has been replicated numerous times around the world. Begun as a joint venture with US developer Gale International \u2013 which has since hawked its \u201ccity in a box\u201d kit to other countries \u2013 the Songdo International Business District was conceived as a $40bn hub for international companies, an exemplar of sustainable urbanism and testing ground for new smart city technologies. It claims to have the highest concentration of green Leed-certified buildings in the world, yet it is still entirely car-based, with not even a train line to the nearby airport. To get to Seoul, just 30km away, takes an hour and a half by metro. Songdo may have an \u201cIntegrated Operations Centre\u201d \u2013 a Big Brother control room where reams of data are funnelled in real time from thousands of sensors across the city \u2013 but the physical urban model is no different to any other car-riddled business district. For all its low-energy labels, it is an expensive, exclusive and impersonal place. The ultimate techno-eco-utopia? Across the world, there are countless new cities like Songdo in the making. Barely differentiable, and often designed and serviced by the same international consultancies, these hi-tech urban enclaves are cropping up from Kenya to Kazakhstan . India has pledged to build 100 smart cities, while Africa is seeing $100bn pumped into at least 20 projects. China, having initiated 500 of its own smart city pilots, is now summoning a string of outposts through its Belt and Road initiative, from the dry port of Khorgos, on its border with Kazakhstan, to east London\u2019s Royal Albert Dock, reborn as the Asian Business Park. Saudi Arabia has pledged to trump them all with Neom, a $500bn mega-project billed as an answer to Silicon Valley. Planned as a centre for renewable energy, biotechnology, manufacturing, media and entertainment, it sprawls across an area 33 times the size of New York City. It claims to be nothing less than \u201cthe world\u2019s most ambitious project\u201d; an incubator for \u201cthe next era of human progress\u201d. The escapist urge to build cities from scratch is nothing new. At the turn of the 19th century, the Garden City movement saw a generation of bucolic communities planned in reaction to the grime and overcrowding of rapidly industrialising cities, driven by a powerful campaign for social reform. Half a century later, the New Town movement developed these ideas, promising a brave new world of modern, self-sufficient municipalities rising from the ruins of the second world war, and focused on building an inclusive, democratic society. Now, in the first decades of a new millennium, a surge in global population growth and a sense of impending environmental armageddon have spurred an epidemic of planned cities of a very different kind. This time they are being conceived by private multinational corporations as gilt-edged gated communities and tax-exempt free-trade hubs, each branded as the ultimate techno-eco-utopia. The need for urban expansion is clear: the United Nations calculates that 68% of the world population will live in cities by 2050, adding another 2.5 billion people to urban areas, the vast majority in Asia and Africa. All these newly minted urbanites will need somewhere to live and work. Yet the vast majority of the newly planned cities are not being designed to house the coming tidal wave of rural-urban migrants. They are instruments to attract international investment and make the urban rich even richer, at a time when property has become the ultimate global currency. According to research from Savills, real estate is now a more valuable asset class than all stocks, shares and securitised debt combined, with a total value of around $228tn. That represents three and a half times global GDP, or 40 times the value of all the gold ever mined. While once we dug down to extract value from the earth, the bristling glass towers of these new urban enclaves are the inverted mineshafts of today \u2013 complete with equally damaging side effects. This new breed of city takes various different forms, from government initiatives, to public-private partnerships, to entirely private enterprises. Many are being used to jump-start economies in the developing world, with masterplans carefully calibrated to attract foreign investors and treasuries looking to sink their funds into something concrete. They provide a powerful means for wealthy countries to expand their strategic influence abroad, with the construction of new cities acting as a form of \u201cdebt-trap diplomacy\u201d, tying host nations into impossibly burdensome deals. They are billed as a panacea for the world\u2019s urban ills, solving overcrowding, congestion and pollution; yet, more often than not, they turn out to be catalysts for land dispossession, environmental degradation and social inequality. At the southern tip of Malaysia on a series of four artificial islands, one such promised Elysium is sprouting from the sand. Launched in 2014, Forest City is a $100bn joint venture between the Chinese developer Country Garden and the Sultan of Johor. It is planned to house 700,000 people by 2050. Forest City has been marketed as an \u201ciconic urban area\u201d moments from Singapore, a \u201cnew Shenzhen\u201d where the \u201cconcepts of safety, convenience, green and smart are integrated into every corner of life\u201d. It features luxury apartment towers, hotels, offices, shopping malls and an international school, all smothered with a lush blanket of greenery and surrounded by a \u201cvirtual electric fence\u201d. The apartments are prohibitively expensive for most Malaysians but a relative bargain for Chinese investors, who have been flown here in droves and bussed to the spaceship-shaped sales gallery to marvel at the enormous model of the Avatar-like world that awaits. Cashiers stand at the end of the guided tour to take credit card down-payments before the tourists get back on the bus. This self-styled \u201ceco-city\u201d is being built on 162m cubic metres of shipped-in sand that has already had a damaging impact on the surrounding marine environment. The causeway built to facilitate the land reclamation for the islands cuts right across the Tanjung Kupang seagrass meadows, a precious habitat that helps to stabilise the sea floor and protect coastal erosion, while mangroves have been trampled to make way for the development\u2019s prefabrication factories. Reclamation began without the required environmental impact assessment, and the effects have already been felt by local fishermen, who complain of reduced catches due to the destruction of their fragile ecosystem. The emerging island community, meanwhile, is not so much a city as a ghostly duty-free resort, a haunted Photoshop montage mostly bereft of full-time residents.

Elora Mukherjee, the director of Columbia Law School\u2019s immigrant rights clinic, was one of six attorneys to visit the detention center in Clint as part of ongoing litigation about an agreement that states unaccompanied children can\u2019t be held in US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) facilities for more than 72 hours. The team found that children had no adequate access to medical care, had no basic sanitation, were exposed to extreme cold and did not have adequate access to drinking water or food. \u201cI\u2019ve been visiting children detained in federal immigration custody for 12 years,\u201d Mukherjee told the Guardian. \u201cI have never seen anything like this before.

CBP initially denied the attorneys\u2019 reports, but its own watchdog, the homeland security department\u2019s Office of Inspector General, had already put together \u2013 then released last week \u2013 reports warning of dangerous overcrowding in border patrol facilities. On 10 June, the auditor said it witnessed \u201cserious overcrowding\u201d in four of five facilities and prolonged detention at the other five facilities \u2013 of both adults and children \u2013 that needed to be addressed immediately. CBP said in a statement it \u201cleverages our limited resources to provide the best care possible to those in our custody, especially children. As DHS and CBP leadership have noted numerous times, our short-term holding facilities were not designed to hold vulnerable populations and we urgently need additional humanitarian funding to manage this crisis.\u201d In response to the slew of devastating reports, the health department, which takes custody of unaccompanied migrant children until they can be paired with relatives or foster parents, is expanding its shelter network. And the House oversight committee said it will hold a hearing on Wednesday about the treatment of migrants at detention facilities. Also next week, an independent mediator in the case that spurred the attorneys\u2019 visit to Clint is due to provide a report about the detention centers before 12 July, according to court documents. That same day, Lights for Liberty vigils are planned around the country to protest the government\u2019s failure to adequately care for these children.

The number of detained migrants increased in 1996 after then president Bill Clinton signed a pair of laws that introduced mandatory detentions for asylum seekers and legal immigrants who had committed crimes and allowed for indefinite detention. Nagda said after a decade working in this field, she was still shocked by the reports that emerged in recent weeks and was concerned a similar situation was replicated at other border facilities. Despite the grim reality at the border, Nagda clung to the power public outcry could have to change the current conditions. She thinks activists should specifically be pushing for children in detention to have access to pediatricians or medical experts with experience helping children and to have child welfare experts in the facility. \u201cThose kinds of agency changes will only happen in response to extraordinary public pressure and I think the public should take heart that their anger, and rallying and marches could actually influence how this agency spends money and cares for families arriving at the border,\u201d Nagda said, highlighting the role protests played in bringing an end to family separation in the summer of 2018.",

Imported from Warsaw Zoo in Poland in 2016, they have spent the best part of three years in a six-acre pen with a cohort of juveniles and several injured, non-flying Polish adults. The fact that the pair\u2019s eggs were infertile and did not hatch by the end of May was not too disappointing. They\u2019ve since been scavenged by rooks or raptors when the pair stopped sitting on them. They are only four years old, and storks can live to over 30, with their first attempts to breed often failing. Prospects for next year are encouraging. They are up there in the oak, even now, bill-clattering, mating and displaying. Other birds have already shown strong loyalty to the site. Two years ago, a young Knepp bird flew across the Channel to France and, this summer, returned to the pen to rejoin its mates.</p> <p>In the face of reports of unrelenting ecological loss (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/06/human-society-under-urgent-threat-loss-earth-natural-life-un-report\" title=\"\">the UN estimates a million species are on the brink of extinction globally</a>), the white stork\u2019s return is refreshing news. As tens of thousands march about the climate crisis and eco-anxiety besets us, these glimpses of restoration are important. Featuring the storks in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07d1zw0\" title=\"\">BBC\u2019s Springwatch in June</a>, Chris Packham described the project as \u201cimaginative, intelligent, progressive and practical \u2026 this is proper conservation done properly\u201d. The stork, with its links to insurgency and rebirth, might even be the perfect emblem for Extinction Rebellion.</p> <p>And yet its path to restoration in the UK has not been smooth. Support from conservation bodies has been surprisingly difficult to come by, some hard-pressed with their own initiatives; others simply reluctant to stick their necks out. A joint application with the Sussex Wildlife Trust for lottery funding \u2013 which would have secured \u00a31m for schools and community engagement \u2013 was kiboshed by the trust\u2019s own conservation committee just after the project was announced as a finalist. The committee raised doubts about the stork ever having been a British bird, had concerns that English-bred birds would migrate across the Channel, and feared that their messy nests and proximity to humans would cause a hazard, including unwanted debris down people\u2019s chimneys.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/26/british-stork-cities-greek-towns\">Why it\u2019s time to bring back the great British stork | Patrick Barkham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Up stepped the <a href=\"https://www.durrell.org/wildlife/\" title=\"\">Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust</a>, a charity whose mission to \u201csave species from extinction\u201d has won worldwide acclaim, only to be told that at the time of application it did not meet the lottery\u2019s criteria. Ultimately, the project has had to rely on private individuals building introduction pens and feeding the birds at their own expense, and the expertise of tiny yet determined conservation organisations such as the <a href=\"http://www.roydennis.org/\" title=\"\">Roy Dennis Wildlife Foundation</a> \u2013 responsible for the successful reintroductions of ospreys and white-tailed eagles to Britain \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.cotswoldwildlifepark.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Cotswold Wildlife Park,</a> which quarantined the original Polish birds and continues to manage and cover the costs of the captive breeding programme using its own staff and facilities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5979c4434f3994097de1e5ffcb158ead9858a147\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5979c4434f3994097de1e5ffcb158ead9858a147/0_72_2240_1344/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Storks in their nests on prefabricated posts in an estate near Caceres, Extremadura, Spain\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Storks in their nests on prefabricated posts in Extremadura, Spain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jorge Rey/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Across Europe, as fatalities from power lines and roads have increased, and populations have suffered from the draining of wetlands and disappearance of insect-rich pastures and meadows, the loss of storks has been felt deeply. A few years ago, a tearful old woman in a village in Belarus showed me the nest on her roof empty of storks for the first time in living memory. Where storks have been reintroduced, they are greeted with delight and the restoration of historical stork festivals. The Spanish erect poles for nests along their motorways and in Alsace householders install cartwheels for storks on their roofs. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/21/frozen-storks-bulgarians-rush-to-save-migrating-birds\" title=\"\">During a cold snap in Bulgaria last March, villagers sheltered white storks in their homes</a>.</p> <p>A driving inspiration behind the project in the UK is the hope that the storks\u2019 return will spark similar feelings of empathy and affection here. Bill-clattering from their nests on rooftops, churches and town halls, they might also induce concern for the wider countryside where they fly off to feed on earthworms, grasshoppers and frogs. White storks could be that charismatic species that connects urban communities directly with landscape restoration. Certainly, people once loved them here. Our local village, Storrington, was originally \u201cEstorcheton\u201d or \u201chome of the storks\u201d. And the public response has been overwhelming, with people flocking to see white storks flying free in England for the first time in hundreds of years, and private landowners queueing up to offer more introduction sites.</p> <p>The flight of the white stork over Britain seems to articulate perfectly the public desire for ecological change and regeneration; it is the triumph of the bigger picture over bureaucracy, self-interest and negativity; a beacon of hope in a world that, too often, drags its heels.</p> <p>\u2022 Isabella Tree is the author of Wilding: The return of Nature to a British Farm, charting her rewilding project.

They\u2019ve since been scavenged by rooks or raptors when the pair stopped sitting on them. They are only four years old, and storks can live to over 30, with their first attempts to breed often failing. Prospects for next year are encouraging. They are up there in the oak, even now, bill-clattering, mating and displaying. Other birds have already shown strong loyalty to the site. Two years ago, a young Knepp bird flew across the Channel to France and, this summer, returned to the pen to rejoin its mates. In the face of reports of unrelenting ecological loss (the UN estimates a million species are on the brink of extinction globally), the white stork\u2019s return is refreshing news. As tens of thousands march about the climate crisis and eco-anxiety besets us, these glimpses of restoration are important. Featuring the storks in BBC\u2019s Springwatch in June, Chris Packham described the project as \u201cimaginative, intelligent, progressive and practical \u2026 this is proper conservation done properly\u201d. The stork, with its links to insurgency and rebirth, might even be the perfect emblem for Extinction Rebellion. And yet its path to restoration in the UK has not been smooth. Support from conservation bodies has been surprisingly difficult to come by, some hard-pressed with their own initiatives; others simply reluctant to stick their necks out. A joint application with the Sussex Wildlife Trust for lottery funding \u2013 which would have secured \u00a31m for schools and community engagement \u2013 was kiboshed by the trust\u2019s own conservation committee just after the project was announced as a finalist. The committee raised doubts about the stork ever having been a British bird, had concerns that English-bred birds would migrate across the Channel, and feared that their messy nests and proximity to humans would cause a hazard, including unwanted debris down people\u2019s chimneys. Up stepped the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, a charity whose mission to \u201csave species from extinction\u201d has won worldwide acclaim, only to be told that at the time of application it did not meet the lottery\u2019s criteria. Ultimately, the project has had to rely on private individuals building introduction pens and feeding the birds at their own expense, and the expertise of tiny yet determined conservation organisations such as the Roy Dennis Wildlife Foundation \u2013 responsible for the successful reintroductions of ospreys and white-tailed eagles to Britain \u2013 and Cotswold Wildlife Park, which quarantined the original Polish birds and continues to manage and cover the costs of the captive breeding programme using its own staff and facilities. Across Europe, as fatalities from power lines and roads have increased, and populations have suffered from the draining of wetlands and disappearance of insect-rich pastures and meadows, the loss of storks has been felt deeply. A few years ago, a tearful old woman in a village in Belarus showed me the nest on her roof empty of storks for the first time in living memory. Where storks have been reintroduced, they are greeted with delight and the restoration of historical stork festivals. The Spanish erect poles for nests along their motorways and in Alsace householders install cartwheels for storks on their roofs. During a cold snap in Bulgaria last March, villagers sheltered white storks in their homes. A driving inspiration behind the project in the UK is the hope that the storks\u2019 return will spark similar feelings of empathy and affection here. Bill-clattering from their nests on rooftops, churches and town halls, they might also induce concern for the wider countryside where they fly off to feed on earthworms, grasshoppers and frogs. White storks could be that charismatic species that connects urban communities directly with landscape restoration. Certainly, people once loved them here. Our local village, Storrington, was originally \u201cEstorcheton\u201d or \u201chome of the storks\u201d. And the public response has been overwhelming, with people flocking to see white storks flying free in England for the first time in hundreds of years, and private landowners queueing up to offer more introduction sites. The flight of the white stork over Britain seems to articulate perfectly the public desire for ecological change and regeneration; it is the triumph of the bigger picture over bureaucracy, self-interest and negativity; a beacon of hope in a world that, too often, drags its heels. \u2022 Isabella Tree is the author of Wilding: The return of Nature to a British Farm, charting her rewilding project.

      "bodyText": "Many cannabis users and businesses are invested in the idea of cannabis as an anxiety treatment. The position invites skepticism: marijuana companies have a financial interest in promoting a maximalist view of the drug\u2019s benefits, and in patients it can look like a rationalization for excessive use. As with other health conditions, the available research is inconclusive and limited due to decades-old restrictions on medical marijuana research. To sort through some of the ambiguities surrounding cannabis and anxiety, I spoke to Jordan Tishler, a Boston-area doctor who has a cannabis-focused practice.

The study examines levels of nitrogen dioxide and particulate pollution (PM2.5) in the city and calculates that an eight-year-old child could die up to seven months early if exposed over their lifetimes to toxic air. The loss of life expectancy is worse in Birmingham than some other major cities in the UK including Manchester, researchers found. Birmingham is one of five cities required by the government to set up a clean air zone to reduce toxic air, as part of plans to tackle the illegal levels of pollution in 38 out of 43 areas of the country. But in Birmingham and Leeds the start date of January next year has been postponed because of government delays in providing vehicle-checking software. On Monday research commissioned by UK100 \u2013 a network of local leaders across the country \u2013 for the first time examines the burden air pollution places on mortality in major cities. The report, carried out by Kings College London, said the health cost of the city\u2019s toxic air was \u00a3470m every year. The study examined NO2 and PM2.5, two of the leading causes of poor health from air pollution, in the city\u2019s 10 constituencies.

More than half of children in Birmingham live in the top 10% of the most deprived areas of the country, and about 8,000 children in the city are growing up in the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods in the UK, according to a report by the Children\u2019s Society.

The details of the failed deal are contained in documents submitted to the high court last week on behalf of creditors to Woodhouse\u2019s businesses, when the entrepreneur lost control of three of his companies and a judge ruled his business model appeared to be \u201cthoroughly dishonest\u201d. The hearing came just days after publication of an undercover investigation by the Guardian and ITV News, which posed questions about the business interests of Woodhouse, who has raised more than \u00a380m from private investors but whose firms have a multimillion-pound \u201cblack hole\u201d. Woodhouse\u2019s Northern Powerhouse Developments (NPD) had been selling investments in rooms of the Moorland Garden \u2013 a hotel on the edge of Dartmoor national park that is owned by Brian Meaden, the father of the BBC Dragons\u2019 Den panellist Deborah. NPD, which has a portfolio of 11 operational hotels, had paid a non-refundable deposit on the property understood to be in excess of \u00a3500,000. However, after missing several deadlines to complete the purchase, the deal has now fallen through. The witness statement of Phil Duffy, a managing director of insolvency firm Duff &amp; Phelps whom the high court appointed as an interim manager of three Woodhouse businesses last week, said: \u201cNow that the purchase has collapsed and the deposit has been forfeited, the investments of any investors whose monies were used to fund the deposit paid by the NPD Group will have been lost. \u201cQuite simply, investors\u2019 monies should not under any circumstances have been used, or put at risk, in this way\u201d. In court, Judge Sally Barber referred to the failure of the deal as \u201cdisastrous\u201d. The Guardian and ITV News\u2019 undercover investigation showed how Woodhouse had raised \u00a316m about five years ago from private investors to fund four care homes \u2013 none of which are operational and three of which have not been built. Millions of pounds from those stalled care home projects were loaned to another company in which Woodhouse owns 60% of the shares, but that company has gone into administration and the cash appears to have vanished. Woodhouse has denied any wrongdoing. A spokesman for NPD said: \u201cWe remain in discussions with the owners of the [Moorland Garden] hotel and, despite the recent setbacks and media campaign against us, we\u2019re still hopeful of a purchase.\u201d Meaden said he \u201cwithdrew from negotiations some time ago\u201d.",

My story has a lot of twists and turns.\u201d</p> <p>Warren grew up in Oklahoma, the youngest of four children. In the early 1960s, her father suffered a heart attack and lost his job. The family lost their station wagon and they would have lost their house, too, Warren says, if her mother, who had never worked outside the home, hadn\u2019t found a minimum-wage job at the local Sears department store.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was a girl, a full-time minimum-wage job in America would support a family of three,\u201d Warren said at the house party in New Hampshire.</p> <p>\u201cToday a full-time minimum-wage job in America will not keep a momma and a baby out of poverty. That is wrong, and that is why I\u2019m in this fight.\u201d</p> <p>She unspools the story of her early adulthood emphatically, bit by bit. She won a scholarship to college (\u201cYay!\u201d) , then she fell in love at 19, got married (\u201cNot to that guy,\u201d she says, pointing theatrically at her second husband, Bruce Mann); and dropped out of college (\u201cUggh.\u201d)</p> <p>She later enrolled at a commuter college and eventually landed her \u201cdream job\u201d as a special needs teacher. But after becoming pregnant, she was \u201cshown the door\u201d.</p> <p>Shortly after graduating from law school, a feat she credits to the M&amp;Ms that helped potty-train her children so she could leave them at daycare while attending class, Warren took a university job teaching law. She married Mann, whom she calls her \u201ckeeper husband\u201d, and set about becoming one of the nation\u2019s leading experts on bankruptcy law.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bx22w8FHaMW/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "To the crowd of voters who gathered in the garden of a New Hampshire home on a serene summer\u2019s day in June, Elizabeth Warren expressed her sincere gratitude. There was a dissonance, she acknowledged, between the \u201cgorgeous\u201d setting and the bleak picture she would paint of a democracy in peril. \u201cOur country\u2019s in real trouble,\u201d Warren said, pacing as she spoke. \u201cA lot of trouble. \u201cSo what\u2019s it going to take to change that?\u201d she continued. \u201cBig, structural change.\u201d Alexandra Barker, the host of the event, couldn\u2019t agree more. \u201cIf things don\u2019t change, this is the home I\u2019ll sell to send him to college,\u201d she said, hugging her 11-year-old son, Ricky. \u201cIf there\u2019s anyone who can actually get it done, I believe it\u2019s going to be her.\u201d More than six months into her presidential campaign \u2013 after holding 105 town halls, answering nearly 500 questions from voters and taking more than 35,000 selfies \u2013 the Massachusetts senator has emerged as a top-tier contender, and increasingly as the top choice of the American left, in the crowded race for the Democratic nomination. But the opening months of Warren\u2019s campaign were less even. She was the first major candidate to enter the race on New Year\u2019s Eve 2018 amid a cloud of controversy over her past claims of Cherokee heritage and speculation that she would run in the shadow of her longtime ideological ally and closest rival, Bernie Sanders. Her decision to release the results of a DNA test that revealed her distant Native American ancestry in response to taunts by Donald Trump upset members of the Cherokee nation and continues to raise questions about her political acumen among some voters desperately trying to unseat the president. Setting the agenda Warren\u2019s ascent has been fueled in part by her rapidly expanding portfolio of liberal policy proposals for establishing universal childcare, canceling student loan debt, breaking up big tech and expanding voting access. Her centerpiece proposal \u2013 the plan to pay for her plans \u2013 is an \u201cultra-millionaire tax\u201d on assets above $50m, which she tells audiences would include \u201cyour Rembrandts, your stock portfolio, your diamonds and your yachts\u201d. Taken together, her platform would dramatically reshape the American economy. The steady stream of policy releases has boosted Warren\u2019s profile and, importantly, created fundraising opportunities for a campaign that has staked its financial sustainability on grassroots support. By offering a clear and detailed vision of what a Warren presidency might look like, she has forced her rivals to play catch-up. Her standing was cemented late last month by a crisp performance in the first presidential primary debate in Miami. A spate of recent post-debate polls showed the former Harvard law professor had gained ground, alongside the California senator Kamala Harris, as support for the early frontrunners Joe Biden and Sanders waned. She has ranked consistently, placing third in three national surveys and one poll of Iowa caucusgoers. \u201cShe has the professor part down,\u201d said Lucy Gagnon, after waiting patiently in one of Warren\u2019s famous \u201cselfie lines\u201d for her chance to take a photo with the senator at an event in Windham. \u201cI really believe that she could educate the country as to what these issues really are and to make them understandable for people because I don\u2019t think the average person realizes what trouble we\u2019re in.\u201d Maria Velez, who came to Warren\u2019s town hall on the Florida International University campus in Miami the day before, said she had never donated to a candidate before sending $20 to Warren\u2019s campaign \u2013 twice. \u201cEvery time I hear her talk I\u2019m inspired,\u201d Velez said. \u201cShe has a plan for everything. And she explains her plans in a way that is so easy to understand.\u201d Warren, like others in the race, has faced skepticism about her \u201celectability\u201d \u2013 a concern that can include gender bias \u2013 as a party still carrying the scars of Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 loss tries to divine which candidate is best suited to defeating Trump. David Darnell, who saw Warren speak at the house party in New Hampshire, said he likes Warren\u2019s policies but was initially put off by her \u201cfinger-wagging, schoolmarm\u201d presentation on the campaign trail. \u201cI want to stress, one, I think she\u2019s gotten better,\u201d Darnell said. \u201cBut, two, I think it\u2019s a problem we white males have, we don\u2019t like it when someone speaks down to you. And I hate to admit [that] it bugged me.\u201d Warren is among his top choices, alongside Senators Harris, Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar. But he worries Warren, who Trump has mocked as \u201cPocahontas\u201d might be too easy a target for the president. When asked about her \u201celectability\u201d, Warren points to her 2012 Senate race against Scott Brown, a popular Republican incumbent. The race was fiercely contested and polling at the time found that Brown had a higher favorability. Warren defeated Brown to became the first female senator in Massachusetts\u2019 history. \u2018My story has a lot of twists and turns\u2019 It\u2019s not just her plans that are resonating. In interviews with more than a dozen attendees at Warren\u2019s campaign events in recent weeks, people, and especially women, said they were drawn to her personal story. \u201cI\u2019m like a lot of Americans,\u201d Warren says. \u201cI do not have an entirely straight path story. My story has a lot of twists and turns.\u201d Warren grew up in Oklahoma, the youngest of four children. In the early 1960s, her father suffered a heart attack and lost his job. The family lost their station wagon and they would have lost their house, too, Warren says, if her mother, who had never worked outside the home, hadn\u2019t found a minimum-wage job at the local Sears department store. \u201cWhen I was a girl, a full-time minimum-wage job in America would support a family of three,\u201d Warren said at the house party in New Hampshire. \u201cToday a full-time minimum-wage job in America will not keep a momma and a baby out of poverty. That is wrong, and that is why I\u2019m in this fight.\u201d She unspools the story of her early adulthood emphatically, bit by bit. She won a scholarship to college (\u201cYay!\u201d) , then she fell in love at 19, got married (\u201cNot to that guy,\u201d she says, pointing theatrically at her second husband, Bruce Mann); and dropped out of college (\u201cUggh.\u201d) She later enrolled at a commuter college and eventually landed her \u201cdream job\u201d as a special needs teacher. But after becoming pregnant, she was \u201cshown the door\u201d. Shortly after graduating from law school, a feat she credits to the M&amp;Ms that helped potty-train her children so she could leave them at daycare while attending class, Warren took a university job teaching law. She married Mann, whom she calls her \u201ckeeper husband\u201d, and set about becoming one of the nation\u2019s leading experts on bankruptcy law. Before answering questions from the audience, Warren typically wraps her story: \u201cMy daddy ended up as a janitor but his baby daughter got the opportunity to become a public school teacher, to become a college professor, to become a United States senator and to become a candidate for president of the United States.\u201d \u2018The biggest anti-corruption plan since Watergate\u2019 Warren is gaining ground with her plans and her story. But what Democratic voters say they care about most is a plan to remove Trump from office. Warren believes the answer is to take Trump at his word. In 2016 he promised to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d and fix Washington. But she argues that Trump has only made Washington swampier. Corruption, she believes, is the root of Washington\u2019s dysfunction and the reason Congress is not responsive to popular policy ideas. The next president must first address corruption if Democrats hope to make progress toward any of their policy goals, from enacting immigration reform to protecting the planet. \u201cHere\u2019s the good news,\u201d she likes to say. \u201cI have the biggest anti-corruption plan since Watergate. Here\u2019s the bad news. We need the biggest anti-corruption activist since Watergate.\u201d To emphasize her commitment to fighting corruption, Warren swore off private fundraising events with wealthy donors during the primary race.

Warren\u2019s campaign says it isn\u2019t worried. Forgoing high-dollar fundraisers gives her more time to spend hosting town halls and posing for photos with voters, aides say.

Polling shows she has made gains among black voters, a key constituency for Democrats. On Friday she introduced a series of executive actions she would take to level the wage and leadership gap for women of color. There are also fresh signs that a Warren nomination could face less institutional resistance should she emerge as the party\u2019s nominee. At a recent gathering of moderate Democrats and lawmakers, several acknowledged that they had policy quibbles with Warren but otherwise weren\u2019t opposed to her nomination. But most urgently, she must move past Sanders, whose strong grassroots support and loyal base represents a unique challenge. With her ferocious critique of 21st century capitalism \u2013 as well as her quick call for Trump\u2019s impeachment, her refusal to go on Fox News and her resolute support for eliminating private health insurance, a position that some activists had started to doubt \u2013 Warren has steadily carved into the progressive coalition Sanders built in 2016. At the same time they have distanced themselves from one another. Sanders proudly defines himself as a democratic socialist while Warren calls herself a \u201ccapitalist to my bones\u201d. And therein lies her grandest plan: to save capitalism from itself. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got a government \u2013 when you\u2019ve got an economy that does great for those with money and isn\u2019t doing great for everyone else \u2013 that is corruption, pure and simple,\u201d she said from the center of the debate stage in Miami earlier this month. \u201cWe need to call it out.

In Wordsworth\u2019s play The Borderers, a beggar recounts a dark dream in which her baby, delighted by a foxglove flower, uses it to trap a bee, and then dies.

      "bodyText": "Wharfedale is in the grip of a midsummer daydream. Woods are tropically dense, the air is hot and heavy, and the sun is a humid smudge. Oxeye daisies foam up in great hazes from roadside verges and riverbanks. Lanes smell of honeysuckle, dog rose and lemony elderflower. People jump into rivers and couples canoodle under waterfalls. The world brims with a narcotic sense of possibility, like reality is becoming untethered at the edges and blurring into fantasy. Even amid all this, the heart-stopping pink flowers of the foxglove (Digitalis purpurea) still manage to shock the eye. The time around the solstice is said to be when the veil between worlds is most porous, which would explain how this plant managed to slip into ours; its ubiquity, its \u201cordinariness\u201d, does nothing to allay its strangeness. On a hazy hillside above Bolton Abbey, as the day slips into a long evening, the outrageous spikes rise up from the messy margins of fields dotted with machine-wrapped hay bales, a faintly subversive reminder of nature\u2019s irrepressibility. Like the vilified animals from which they take their name, foxgloves thrive in the inbetween spaces; bracken-covered banks, furtive woodland glades and rough pasture. The ostentatious beauty of the bell-shaped blooms, which dangle from the sides of lolling spires, is matched by their toxicity; I find they trigger a kind of instinctive caution, too bright to be benign. This tension animates much of the literature and folklore surrounding the plant, particularly among the Romantics. Mary Webb wrote: \u201cThe foxglove bells, with lolling tongue, / Will not reveal what peals were rung / In Faery\u201d. In Wordsworth\u2019s play The Borderers, a beggar recounts a dark dream in which her baby, delighted by a foxglove flower, uses it to trap a bee, and then dies. Yet the active principles of the plant have long since been isolated for medicinal purposes and are now commonly used as heart stimulants; foxgloves literally have the power of life and death. It is a day for being drunk on the world, but like the solstice itself, the dual nature of the foxglove is a reminder of the inseparability of opposites. Enjoy it while it lasts.",

We know that since the early anti-sweatshop movement, women have been at the forefront of fighting for workers\u2019 rights. Women have only recently got to the leadership of national unions. So this is another milestone.\u201d</p> <p>Both Shuler and Nelson have strong allies on the AFL-CIO\u2019s executive council. \u201cI think the world of Liz,\u201d said Lonnie Stephenson, president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW). \u201cShe\u2019s very forthright. She doesn\u2019t want to be the center of attention. I see her as a consensus builder who brings groups together.\u201d</p> <p>As for Nelson, Cecil Roberts, president of the United Mine Workers, said: \u201cI have great respect for Sara. She\u2019s been a tremendous help to our union.\u201d He said she had taken a leading role in urging Congress to enact a law that would rescue the mineworkers\u2019 beleaguered pension fund. \u201cShe is probably as good a spokesperson as labor has,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cShe is a great speaker. She is very passionate and fiery. She inspires.\u201d</p> <p>Having finished college with $45,000 in student debt, Nelson felt lucky to land a flight attendant\u2019s job with United Airlines in 1996. With many co-workers facing sexual harassment and scheduling problems, she became a union activist, and in 2002, she was named the flight attendants\u2019 communications director, locking horns with United after it filed for bankruptcy protection.</p> <p>Nelson was elected union vice-president in 2011, heading its successful No Knives Ever Again Campaign to prohibit airlines from letting passengers carry knives. She won the union\u2019s presidency in 2014 and has led efforts to unionize flight attendants at Cathay Pacific, Virgin America and Norwegian Airlines.</p> <p>Shuler, the daughter of an IBEW member, went to work for that union in 1993 as an organizer in Oregon. She was assigned to California in 1998 to help defeat a statewide anti-union referendum, and after that victory, the electrical workers made her a lobbyist in Washington and later an assistant to the union\u2019s president. With Trumka naming her his running mate in 2009, she became the highest-ranking woman in labor history. As the AFL-CIO\u2019s No 2, she is chief financial officer at a time of huge financial strain \u2013 many unions have lost members. Shuler\u2019s responsibilities include leading the AFL-CIO\u2019s efforts to attract more young workers into unions and to organize video game developers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7bda305c0dbbbb4549b81e90a7cc9dd325ced340\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7bda305c0dbbbb4549b81e90a7cc9dd325ced340/0_192_5765_3459/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Trumka, centre, has no plans to step down as president of the AFL-CIO before the federation\u2019s convention in 2021, officials insist.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Trumka, centre, has no plans to step down as president of the AFL-CIO before the federation\u2019s convention in 2021, officials insist.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With so many tensions within labor, some labor leaders say it would make sense to have a consensus builder like Shuler as AFL-CIO president.

      "bodyText": "Liz Shuler and Sara Nelson have many things in common \u2013 both are from Oregon, both are in their 40s, and both are prominent labor leaders. Shuler is secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO, the nation\u2019s largest labor federation, Nelson is president of the Association of Flight Attendants. Another thing they have in common: both hope to succeed Richard Trumka someday as the AFL-CIO\u2019s president. After decades of being held back, women have only recently risen to the top ranks of America\u2019s labor unions. For a woman to head the AFL-CIO and become the nation\u2019s most powerful, visible labor leader would be \u201crather extraordinary\u201d, as one historian put it. But neither Shuler nor Nelson will admit to having an eye on that prize. Both know it would look bad to declare their candidacy with 27 months still left in Trumka\u2019s term. Shuler, 49, is not flashy \u2013 she\u2019s a well-liked team player, solid speaker and excellent administrator. Nelson, 46, is a charismatic speaker and is often viewed as a militant \u2013 she likes to shake things up Shuler played a leading role last year in mobilizing Missourians to overturn that state\u2019s anti-union-fee law (known as a \u201cright to work\u201d law). Nelson was catapulted into the spotlight last January when she called for a general strike to pressure Donald Trump and Congress to end the government shutdown. Although AFL-CIO headquarters says there is no campaign under way, there\u2019s a lot happening beyond that official position. Two top union leaders who insisted on anonymity said that early this year Trumka and Shuler were asking various union presidents whether they would support Shuler to be the AFL-CIO\u2019s next president. These officials said Trumka, the AFL-CIO\u2019s head since 2009, appeared at the time to be considering stepping down within a few months to make way for Shuler, but only if there were strong support for her in the federation\u2019s 55-member executive council, which is composed largely of union presidents. AFL-CIO officials insist that Trumka, 69, has no plans to step down before the federation\u2019s convention in 2021. Several officials said Trumka dropped the idea of resigning early after the presidents of three large unions representing nearly half the AFL-CIO\u2019s 9 million union members indicated they were not prepared to support Shuler \u2013 or anyone else at this point. Those three presidents were Randi Weingarten of the American Federation of Teachers, Lee Saunders of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, and Marc Perrone of the United Food and Commercial Workers. Shuler and Nelson declined to be interviewed for this article \u2013 talking publicly could signal they are eyeing the AFL-CIO\u2019s presidency. Nonetheless, labor officials say both are jockeying for labor\u2019s top position. \u201cIt\u2019s really exciting that it\u2019s two women,\u201d said Janice Fine, a professor of labor studies at Rutgers. \u201cWe know that a majority of the workforce is women.

Some staff were routinely forced to change job or relocate for work, finding their positions had been scrapped.</p> <p>The accused deny the charges.</p> <p>The court heard accounts from the families of several workers who had taken their own lives. No\u00e9mie Louvradoux told how her father, R\u00e9my Louvradoux, a 57-year-old public sector worker at France T\u00e9l\u00e9com, killed himself days before her 18th birthday.</p> <p>\u201cWe loved my father. You killed him. And all for what?\u201d she said in court, addressing the former executives. \u201cFrance T\u00e9l\u00e9com had destroyed his life and left him no way out.\u201d</p> <p>Louvradoux\u2019s case was said by lawyers to sum up the toxic working environment. He had worked his way up in the company from a low position to a more senior local role, but in 2006 his job was scrapped and he was made to relocate and change jobs four times in three years, while trying to work as hard as possible to avoid more change. He had written to company bosses in 2009 complaining of an endemic problem and saying: \u201cNothing is being done to face it up to it: suicide remains the only solution.\u201d</p> <p>Lombard, the CEO, told the court he never received the letter, which is most likely to have ended up with the human resources department.</p> <p>After state prosecutors recommended maximum penalties, including a \u20ac75,000 (\u00a367,000) fine to be paid by the company, Louvradoux\u2019s son said outside court: \u201cFear has to change sides. These people have to stop feeling impunity, so that they never do this again and so that others never do it again in other companies because they know they\u2019ll risk prison.\u201d</p> <p>Another worker, Daniel Doublet, described how management stopped giving him work to do. He lived in the Paris area but was relocated to Besan\u00e7on, 280 miles (450km) from his family, and his tasks were never defined. \u201cImagine the isolation I felt,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was as if I was nothing \u2026 a parasite.\u201d</p> <p>The widow of Michel Bugead, another worker who took his life, said he had written by email to management to express concerns. She said he, like many others, \u201cwas very attached to the company which had allowed him to rise up the ladder in society.\u201d</p> <p>Lombard denied telling a meeting of managers in 2006 that he would \u201cget people to leave one way or another, either through the window or the door.\u201d In court, where trade unionists in the gallery wore T-shirts printed with the words \u201cthe window or the door\u201d, he denied that management bore any responsibility.</p> <p>\u201cThe transformations a business has to go through aren\u2019t pleasant; that\u2019s just the way it is. There\u2019s nothing I could have done,\u201d he told the court.</p> <p>At one point, when describing how he travelled to a site to tell workers it would not be closed, the judge asked him: \u201cAre you crying, Mr Lombard?\u201d He said that because he was seen as a big executive, \u201cpeople think I don\u2019t have a heart. That\u2019s not true.\u201d</p> <p>The case is a first for a blue-chip company listed on France\u2019s CAC 40 stock index and the first time managers could be held criminally responsible for implementing a strategy of bullying even if they had not dealt directly with the staff affected.</p> <p>The state prosecutor Fran\u00e7oise Benezech told the court: \u201cThere is no question that in designing a restructuring process with huge job cuts and transfers \u2026 the managers knew they were destabilising the workers.\u201d</p> <p>The trial ends on Thursday and judges are expected to take several weeks to return their verdict.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.ie\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

French state prosecutors have urged judges to find the executives guilty of moral harassment and hand down the maximum prison sentence of one year, plus large fines, after details emerged in court of the turmoil felt by workers over systematic bullying tactics aimed at pushing staff to leave. The case against the former state-owned French telecoms firm \u2013 known since 2013 as Orange \u2013 could set a world precedent with company managers held personally criminally responsible for strategic harassment aimed at forcing workers to resign.

Seven former France T\u00e9l\u00e9com bosses, including the former CEO Didier Lombard and the former head of human resources Olivier Barberot, are accused of putting in place a toxic management system of institutional harassment designed to force workers out. Some staff were routinely forced to change job or relocate for work, finding their positions had been scrapped. The accused deny the charges. The court heard accounts from the families of several workers who had taken their own lives. No\u00e9mie Louvradoux told how her father, R\u00e9my Louvradoux, a 57-year-old public sector worker at France T\u00e9l\u00e9com, killed himself days before her 18th birthday. \u201cWe loved my father. You killed him. And all for what?\u201d she said in court, addressing the former executives. \u201cFrance T\u00e9l\u00e9com had destroyed his life and left him no way out.\u201d Louvradoux\u2019s case was said by lawyers to sum up the toxic working environment. He had worked his way up in the company from a low position to a more senior local role, but in 2006 his job was scrapped and he was made to relocate and change jobs four times in three years, while trying to work as hard as possible to avoid more change. He had written to company bosses in 2009 complaining of an endemic problem and saying: \u201cNothing is being done to face it up to it: suicide remains the only solution.\u201d Lombard, the CEO, told the court he never received the letter, which is most likely to have ended up with the human resources department. After state prosecutors recommended maximum penalties, including a \u20ac75,000 (\u00a367,000) fine to be paid by the company, Louvradoux\u2019s son said outside court: \u201cFear has to change sides. These people have to stop feeling impunity, so that they never do this again and so that others never do it again in other companies because they know they\u2019ll risk prison.\u201d Another worker, Daniel Doublet, described how management stopped giving him work to do. He lived in the Paris area but was relocated to Besan\u00e7on, 280 miles (450km) from his family, and his tasks were never defined. \u201cImagine the isolation I felt,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was as if I was nothing \u2026 a parasite.\u201d The widow of Michel Bugead, another worker who took his life, said he had written by email to management to express concerns. She said he, like many others, \u201cwas very attached to the company which had allowed him to rise up the ladder in society.\u201d Lombard denied telling a meeting of managers in 2006 that he would \u201cget people to leave one way or another, either through the window or the door.\u201d In court, where trade unionists in the gallery wore T-shirts printed with the words \u201cthe window or the door\u201d, he denied that management bore any responsibility. \u201cThe transformations a business has to go through aren\u2019t pleasant; that\u2019s just the way it is. There\u2019s nothing I could have done,\u201d he told the court. At one point, when describing how he travelled to a site to tell workers it would not be closed, the judge asked him: \u201cAre you crying, Mr Lombard?\u201d He said that because he was seen as a big executive, \u201cpeople think I don\u2019t have a heart. That\u2019s not true.\u201d The case is a first for a blue-chip company listed on France\u2019s CAC 40 stock index and the first time managers could be held criminally responsible for implementing a strategy of bullying even if they had not dealt directly with the staff affected. The state prosecutor Fran\u00e7oise Benezech told the court: \u201cThere is no question that in designing a restructuring process with huge job cuts and transfers \u2026 the managers knew they were destabilising the workers.\u201d The trial ends on Thursday and judges are expected to take several weeks to return their verdict.

      "bodyText": "A Melbourne family say they are heartbroken after a 13-year-old girl died from the flu late last week, as the national death toll nears 300. Crystal-lee Wightley had the flu for three days before she died at her family\u2019s home. So far this year there have been 131,000 flu cases across Australia and 287 deaths nationally, according to the federal health department. Crystal-lee\u2019s grandmother, Karyn James Wightley, posted an emotional tribute to her first-born granddaughter on Facebook. \u201cMy darling I am heartbroken and life will never be the same. Fly with the Angels my darling girl. Nanny will always miss you,\u201d she said. On the other side of the country another family is mourning the loss of a toddler to the flu. Elijah David Huynh, two, from Karratha in Western Australia\u2019s north, died on Tuesday at Perth\u2019s children\u2019s hospital. His grieving father, Dave Huynh, said his son will always be in his heart. \u201cHaving to say goodbye to you so soon just doesn\u2019t feel real. You were and still are the love of our lives, we couldn\u2019t thank you enough for making us the happiest parents in the world,\u201d Huynh wrote on Facebook. Multiple nursing homes across New South Wales are also grappling with flu outbreaks. The NSW health department has urged family and friends of aged-care residents to get vaccinated against flu or delay visiting if unwell. The NSW health director of communicable diseases, Vicky Sheppeard, said there had been 26 influenza outbreaks in state aged-care facilities last week. \u201cThe elderly are highly vulnerable to influenza and the flu jab is critical to reducing the risk of visitors catching the virus and bringing it into aged-care homes,\u201d Dr Sheppeard said in a statement. There have been 66 confirmed deaths of people aged over 60 years from the flu in NSW, including nine deaths last week. A nursing home near Wollongong was placed in lockdown following an outbreak which began on the June long weekend. An estimated 20 residents and 20 staff contracted flu symptoms and five residents received hospital treatment. Three died. The South Australian government has launched a flu education campaign \u2013 the Flu Stops with You - in the wake of a horror season in that state. \u201cThe flu virus is spread by human contact and can live up to 48 hours on hard, smooth surfaces such as door handles, playground equipment and desktops,\u201d the health minister, Stephen Wade, said in a statement. Top five ways to avoid the flu: Get vaccinated against the flu. Keep at least a one-metre radius between you and people who have flu-like symptoms. Regularly wash hands and wipe down commonly touched surfaces. Cover coughs and sneezes with your elbow or tissues. Stay home from work, school or childcare if unwell. with Australian Associated Press",

Protesters also called on the government to implement universal suffrage.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe want genuine universal suffrage!\u201d, \u201cFree Hong Kong!\u201d, \u201cHong Kongers, go for it!\u201d, and \u201cRetract the bill!\u201d, chanted the spirited and noisy crowds to the rhythms of occasional drum beats earlier in the day.</p> \n<p>Some held up yellow banners and umbrellas to call for universal suffrage. Several waved giant colonial-era flags \u2013 which include the British union flag \u2013 while others and blue flags emblazoned with \u201cHong Kong Independence\u201d.</p> \n<p>Umbrellas were the symbol of the last major set of protests in Hong Kong, the 79-day Umbrella Movement in 2014, which demanded an unfettered vote for ordinary citizens after China ruled that all candidates for Hong Kong\u2019s top leadership job must receive over half of the votes from a largely pro-Beijing nominating committee of 1,200 members, which would select two or three candidates, before going before voters. The civil disobedience movement failed to press Beijing to grant genuine universal suffrage and this has become a source of political tension ever since.</p> \n<p>\u201cI am here to support the young people. It is our fault that we hadn\u2019t spoken out earlier to fight for more freedoms so the task is upon the young now. And they\u2019re so desperate and despondent,\u201d said 68-year-old Mary, who did not wish to give her last name, referring to last Monday\u2019s storming of the legislature building.</p> \n<p>Hong Kong\u2019s authorities appeared nervous that Sunday\u2019s march might turn violent. Police erected giant water-filled barricades outside the West Kowloon railway terminus and closed many entrances to stop protesters from getting in. They also closed and diverted several roads in the area for the protest. The railway company suspended sales of tickets for high-speed trains to and from the terminus on Sunday afternoon.</p> \n<p>Emotions have been running high in Hong Kong over the past month during its biggest political crisis in decades. Millions of people have thronged the streets to protest against a proposed law allowing for the extradition of individuals to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist party.</p> \n<p>Tensions erupted last Monday, the anniversary of Hong Kong\u2019s 1997 return from British to Chinese rule, when hundreds of angry protesters stormed and vandalised the legislature. Police fired teargas after midnight to disperse them.</p> \n<p>Protesters on Sunday said even though police had started arresting people involved in earlier protests, it would not dampen their resolve. \u201cWe will keep coming out until the government respond to us. If they keep ignoring us, people can only escalate their fight,\u201d said a young woman who gave her name as Mimi.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe government doesn\u2019t give a damn about us \u2013 protesting is our only hope,\u201d said Vivian Li, a mother of two toddlers.<br></p>",

One protester was detained for \u201cfailing to produce proof of identity\u201d and the five others were arrested for assaulting a police officer or obstructing the police. \u201cPolice respect the public\u2019s freedoms of expression, speech and assembly. It is the policy of the police to facilitate all peaceful public events while at the same time ensuring public safety and public order. Police strongly condemn the illegal acts of protesters for blocking the roads,\u201d the statement said. The atmosphere had turned tense earlier, with protesters who armed themselves with umbrellas and police in riot gear locked in a stand-off in the commercial district of Mongkok. The march \u2013 which had been given official permission by the police \u2013 started around 3.30pm local time at a park by the harbour front at Tsim Sha Tsui on the Kowloon peninsula, an area popular with tourists. Organisers estimated as many as 230,000 participated in the march, more than was expected. Police said only 56,000 attended. Although it officially ended by early evening, when most of the crowds dispersed after reaching the West Kowloon railway terminus, where high-speed trains link Hong Kong with Chinese cities, protesters began to fill the commercial area in Tsim Sha Tsui in the evening. Late into the evening, protesters continued to march down Nathan Road, the main thoroughfare in Kowloon, occupying half a street. They chanted slogans as they marched northwards, passing Yau Ma Tei and heading towards Mong Kok. After reaching Mongkok, police in riot gear formed into a line to stop protesters from advancing and demanded that they left. \u201cCruel police! Cruel police!\u201d chanted protesters, wearing goggles, masks and holding up umbrellas to shield themselves in case police shot tear gas. \u201cI\u2019d rather sit at home enjoying air-conditioning in this hot weather, but it is the government who forced us to keep protesting,\u201d said a young man who declined to be identified. Although Hong Kong\u2019s leader Carrie Lam has offered to meet university student representatives behind closed doors, he said she had showed no sign of giving in to any of the protesters\u2019 political demands and he was tired of Lam \u201csounding like a broken record\u201d in her reiteration of her position. Hong Kong\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, has apologised for the crisis, but protesters have demanded that the government fully withdraw the bill and release all those arrested in previous protests. They also want the government to launch an independent investigation into the police\u2019s use of force on 12 June, when teargas, rubber bullets and truncheons were used on largely peaceful crowds. Protesters also called on the government to implement universal suffrage. \u201cWe want genuine universal suffrage!\u201d, \u201cFree Hong Kong!\u201d, \u201cHong Kongers, go for it!\u201d, and \u201cRetract the bill!\u201d, chanted the spirited and noisy crowds to the rhythms of occasional drum beats earlier in the day. Some held up yellow banners and umbrellas to call for universal suffrage. Several waved giant colonial-era flags \u2013 which include the British union flag \u2013 while others and blue flags emblazoned with \u201cHong Kong Independence\u201d. Umbrellas were the symbol of the last major set of protests in Hong Kong, the 79-day Umbrella Movement in 2014, which demanded an unfettered vote for ordinary citizens after China ruled that all candidates for Hong Kong\u2019s top leadership job must receive over half of the votes from a largely pro-Beijing nominating committee of 1,200 members, which would select two or three candidates, before going before voters. The civil disobedience movement failed to press Beijing to grant genuine universal suffrage and this has become a source of political tension ever since. \u201cI am here to support the young people. It is our fault that we hadn\u2019t spoken out earlier to fight for more freedoms so the task is upon the young now. And they\u2019re so desperate and despondent,\u201d said 68-year-old Mary, who did not wish to give her last name, referring to last Monday\u2019s storming of the legislature building. Hong Kong\u2019s authorities appeared nervous that Sunday\u2019s march might turn violent. Police erected giant water-filled barricades outside the West Kowloon railway terminus and closed many entrances to stop protesters from getting in. They also closed and diverted several roads in the area for the protest. The railway company suspended sales of tickets for high-speed trains to and from the terminus on Sunday afternoon. Emotions have been running high in Hong Kong over the past month during its biggest political crisis in decades. Millions of people have thronged the streets to protest against a proposed law allowing for the extradition of individuals to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist party. Tensions erupted last Monday, the anniversary of Hong Kong\u2019s 1997 return from British to Chinese rule, when hundreds of angry protesters stormed and vandalised the legislature. Police fired teargas after midnight to disperse them. Protesters on Sunday said even though police had started arresting people involved in earlier protests, it would not dampen their resolve. \u201cWe will keep coming out until the government respond to us. If they keep ignoring us, people can only escalate their fight,\u201d said a young woman who gave her name as Mimi. \u201cThe government doesn\u2019t give a damn about us \u2013 protesting is our only hope,\u201d said Vivian Li, a mother of two toddlers.",

      "bodyText": "Alex Ross-King, 19, who died from a drug overdose at a music festival in New South Wales in January, took an unusually high amount of MDMA before arriving at the venue because she was afraid of being caught with the drugs by police. On Monday the NSW coroner\u2019s court heard Ross-King, from the NSW central coast, had consumed about three-quarters of an MDMA pill and was \u201cpre-loading\u201d on alcohol on a mini bus to the Fomo music festival in Parramatta in January. When she arrived, counsel assisting the inquest Peggy Dwyer told the coroner on Monday, she consumed another two pills \u201capparently to avoid the risk of detection by police of carrying them into the festival\u201d. \u201cShe told her friends that [it was] because she was nervous about being caught by the police that she took the drugs like that, apparently to avoid the risk of being caught,\u201d Dwyer told the inquest. The day of the festival was hot \u2013 with temperatures between 31 and 34 degrees, Dwyer said in her opening to the inquest. \u201cOne friend explains they were dripping with sweat after the five minute walk from the mini bus to the ticket gates at midday,\u201d she told the inquest. In the early afternoon, Ross-King sat under a tree with her friends drinking Vodka and red bull. \u201cShe appeared to be very intoxicated and was sweating and looking flushed,\u201d Dwyer said. Her friends went to find water and ice to cool her, but by the time they returned she had already been taken to the medical tent, where, Dwyer said, she was \u201ccritically unwell\u201d, with a body temperature of 41 degrees and a rapid and irregular pulse. She was taken to Westmead hospital, where she arrived unconscious just after 5pm. About 10 minutes later she went into cardiac arrest. At about 9.15pm, after about four hours of attempted resuscitation, she was declared dead. Ross-King\u2019s death is one of six being investigated by the NSW coroner this week as part of an inquest into what Dwyer called \u201ca recent substantial increase in the drug-related harms associated with a small number of music festivals\u201d and an \u201cunexpectedly marked increase\u201d in the number of drug-related deaths. The inquest is considering ways to prevent further deaths at music festivals, including harm-reduction measures such as what Dwyer called \u201cdrug-checking at festivals\u201d, and issues around law enforcement at music festivals. Ross-King\u2019s death in January followed Joseph Pham, 23, and Diana Nguyen, 21, who attended the Defqon.1 festival in Penrith on 15 September. Nineteen-year-old Callum Brosnan died at the Knockout Games of Destiny at Sydney Olympic Park on 9 December and Josh Tam, 22, at the Lost Paradise festival on the central coast on 29 December. Hoang Tran, known to his family as Nathan, is the sixth case to be examined in the inquest. He died after attending Knockout Circuz in December 2017. One, 19-year-old Brosnan, was believed to have taken between six and nine caps. An analysis of one leftover pill found it had a 76% purity, \u201ca very high purity\u201d, Dwyer said. \u201cThere is no certainty that the remainder of the drugs he took were of the same purity, but it is suggestive that they were,\u201d she said. The inquest is considering, among other things, the impact that a strong and very visible police presence has at music festivals. In Ross-King\u2019s case, Dwyer said, the presence of police at the festival appeared to be a direct cause for her decision to \u201cdouble dose\u201d or \u201cdouble dropping\u201d; taking more than one pill at once, something she said was common. Studies in Australia have shown that almost half of people who used ecstasy at a festival had \u201cdouble dropped\u201d. \u201cI expect that your honour will hear that this is done, as in the case of young Alex, to avoid being caught by police and charged with a criminal offence,\u201d Dwyer told the court. She said that while police and security often played a \u201cvital role\u201d in responding in the case of a medical emergency, the \u201cpresence and behaviours\u201d of police and security can \u201cexacerbate the risks associated with drug use\u201d. \u201cAfter the deaths this summer, NSW Health interviewed a number of patrons who had suffered an adverse reaction to drugs in order to understand the patterns of use,\u201d Dwyer said. \u201cA number of participants reported that their risky behaviours were driven by fear of police, including taking drugs prior to arrival at the event and avoiding the medical centre or open disclosure of substance use.\u201d On Monday morning Dwyer described the \u201ccommon themes\u201d surrounding all six deaths. Each had consumed more than one MDMA tablet or cap, the primary cause of death in all cases. In some cases, such as Ross-King and Tran, the victims were seen to act aggressively or erratically before their deaths, in a way that was out of character. Heat at the music festival venue was a factor in all of the deaths, and most had extremely high body temperatures before their deaths. \u201cOnce body temperatures rise above 40 degrees celsius the body\u2019s ability to regulate its own temperature becomes severely impaired,\u201d Dwyer said. \u201cAt this point, temperatures continue to rise, leading potentially to multi-organ failure, impaired blood clotting and ultimately cerebral oedema. Mortality from drug induced hyperthermia with temperatures above 40 degrees celsius is high.\u201d Dwyer also told the inquest that in all of the cases their children\u2019s drug use came as a shock to their parents after their death. Of Brosnan, Dwyer said: \u201cLike all the young people subject to this inquest, because he functioned so well and was doing so well in life, was so clever and creative and getting on with his life as responsible young adult, Callum\u2019s parents were not aware of any interest in drugs.\u201d The inquest comes against the backdrop of increasing calls in NSW for the introduction of pill testing at music festivals, despite the steadfast opposition of the state government and premier, Gladys Berejiklian. The Royal Australasian College of Physicians, the Australian Medical Association, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the former Australian federal police commissioner Mick Palmer have all called for the testing to be allowed at festivals. The deputy state coroner, Harriet Grahame, will preside over the two weeks of hearings in the inquest. \u201cThese are your children but they could just as easily be the children of my own community or my own family,\u201d she said at the opening of the inquest on Monday. \u201cThey could be any young people who go to music festivals and partake in drugs as many young people do. \u201cThese are our young people ... and we owe them a proper investigation of the circumstances in which they died.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Spoiler alert: this blog is for people watching season two of Big Little Lies, which airs on HBO in the US, Sky Atlantic in the UK and Foxtel\u2019s Showcase in Australia. Don\u2019t read on unless you have watched the most recent episode. \u2018We have to stick together. That\u2019s the only way we\u2019ve gotten this far\u2019 Well, HBO fans, Andrea Arnold has brought a Sharp Objects level of abstraction to this episode of Big Little Lies, although it appears now that the second season was always going to head in a more fragmented direction than the first. The show\u2019s dreaminess has taken on the quality of nightmares, as indicated by the opening scenes, in which each of the liars seemed to go back to the night of Perry\u2019s death. Nowhere was that brokenness more apparent than in the final few moments, which cut between swimming, kayaking, dinner, affairs of the past, affairs of the present, Mary Louise, a storm, and Bonnie apparently on her way to hand herself in at the police station, until she saw the suspicious Corey leaving. I am assuming he is undercover, seducing Jane to get information about what happened to Perry. If that is the case, then, well, poor Jane, having experienced abuse piled upon abuse. There was trauma all over this episode. The difficult relationship between Bonnie and her mother was made explicit in the flashbacks to her childhood, and her confrontation with her father about his failure to protect her took things in an interesting new direction, exploring domestic violence of a different hue. The title, although literally what Bonnie\u2019s mother asked of her, works well when it comes to Madeleine\u2019s attempt to salvage her relationship with Ed.

Notes and observations I had completely forgotten that Celeste was a lawyer until Renata pointed it out this episode. On the subject of when they find time to work, I defer to this tweet on the liars\u2019 shared calendar. \u201cThey said it was ultimately a smear on the whole publication if I was in this article.\u201d No feelings were spared in the making of the magazine that cut out Renata. Oh, Ed. Is having a revenge affair really going to make you feel better? Mary Louise is so good at provocation and manipulation. The scene of her reeling in Renata, and tearing up any notion of a \u201cmother-to-mother\u201d talk, was fantastic. \u201cI was hoping this would just be about tea, but people don\u2019t do that any more, do they?\u201d Did Mary Louise see Alex Morgan\u2019s goal-scoring celebration?

On the way home from the workshop, Madeleine played the brilliant Baby by Donnie and Joe Emerson, which also accompanied the closing credits.

Three wickets for four runs in two overs. England\u2019s captain survived the hat-trick ball, but the next over brought only one Heather Knight run off the bat.

Preparation made that possible, on a ground that has a pronounced angle like Lord\u2019s. \u201cI had the opportunity to play a Test here a couple of years ago,\u201d was Perry\u2019s explanation. \u201cI think the slope really works well for us, almost against the way you want to swing the ball. You can move the ball away against the slope.\u201d In 50-over cricket, Andy Bichel once took 7-20 against England and Glenn McGrath 7-15 against Namibia. Those are the only better bowling figures by Australians, after Perry beat out Shelley Nitschke\u2019s 7-24. And that one also came against England. Sorry, England. But as if England won\u2019t be thinking about these things already. You don\u2019t lose seven wickets to a bowler and then just go about your day. Like Kylie has been for so long, Ellyse has proved to be very catchy. With a Test match coming up, England need to fill their heads with another tune.",
