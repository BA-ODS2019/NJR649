Quantum communication \u2013 to create hacker-proof information highways - is another.<br><br>Dr Jacq Romero, a quantum physicist at the University of Queensland and Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Engineered Quantum Systems, is well-versed in the possibilities these new technologies will present. Most computers work to a binary code, but information in the quantum world can be much richer. Rather than ones and zeros, Romero encodes data using the shape of photons, the basic units of light.<br><br>\u201cThe most exciting aspect for me is that quantum physics can lead to powerful technologies for the future,\u201d says Romero. \u201cI\u2019m exploring the possibilities to develop hacker-proof communication technologies.\u201d<br><br>\u201cYou can have light of different shapes \u2013 we can make it doughnut-shaped, flower-shaped, anything you like. These shapes are like an alphabet that can encode information, and we can use them to send messages.\u201d<br><br>When data is being sent using quantum communication, you can tell if it\u2019s being hacked.<br><br>Information encoded in quantum systems, like single photons, is fragile.

      "bodyText": "In our increasingly connected world, data is rapidly becoming the currency of the future. Three women \u2013 Lucinda Hartley, Dr Jacq Romero and Riva Mendoza \u2013 are at the forefront in their traditionally male-dominated fields to find ways of using data that improves our privacy, our neighbourhoods, and our wellbeing. Digital data mapping out real-world interactions Lucinda Hartley believes that how we treat data can benefit society on many levels. She is chief innovation officer of Neighbourlytics, a social data analytics platform for neighbourhoods which harnesses real-time digital data to help property developers and governments make evidence-based decisions that maximise the impact of their projects and measure wellbeing. \u201cWe\u2019re so focused on getting the right roads and the right infrastructure that we often forget that the messy human side is also what creates real value in our cities,\u201d says Hartley. Neighbourlytics examines how people use space within neighbourhoods. \u201cWe draw from social data that\u2019s reflective of people\u2019s behaviour and lifestyle choices,\u201d she says. \u201cWe use sources such as social media, Google Maps, and event pages to collect millions of data points on how people interact with their communities, and what assets and opportunities are available. It\u2019s like X-raying your neighbourhood. You see things you weren\u2019t aware of.\u201d Hartley recounts working in the outer-suburban developments of Greenfields in Victoria. \u201cIn many ways these neighbourhoods look very quiet, almost like dormitory suburbs. But we found this incredible density of home-based businesses. There was a huge amount of business activity going on, just not in a way that was visible on the street.\u201d Such social information helps property developers and governments not only make more informed decisions around what infrastructure is needed but also to assess how their projects contribute to the wellbeing of the city. \u201cWe\u2019re in the sweet spot of helping property developers achieve both their social and economic objectives,\u201d says Hartley. \u201cThe property sector has realised that the places that have the best cultural and social life also have better sales, longer tenancies, and better returns. Everyone wants to create liveable neighbourhoods because they produce the best lifestyle outcomes and the best returns.\u201d More than 80 percent of Australians live in cities, so it\u2019s important that they let people thrive. \u201cYour postcode is as likely to determine your life expectancy as your genetic code,\u201d Hartley explains. People are healthier when they can access meaningful work and spaces like parks that foster their wellbeing; when they\u2019re involved in their community; and when they have strong social connections. Digital communication, but not as we know it We know that the laws of physics rule the natural world, and they have extensive applications in the tech world too. Quantum physicists across the globe are locked in a race to build the world\u2019s first proper quantum computer, while the rest of us are still trying to understand what the term means. Quantum computing is an entirely different beast to computing as we know it today - it\u2019s like comparing a bicycle to a F1 supercar. It will radically change our approach on everything from data security, to health outcomes. At the moment, calculating properties of molecules for drug development is too difficult for most supercomputers, but a quantum computer operates on the same properties of the molecules it reads, which has incredible potential for unlocking new cures. But quantum computing in just one application. Quantum communication \u2013 to create hacker-proof information highways - is another. Dr Jacq Romero, a quantum physicist at the University of Queensland and Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Engineered Quantum Systems, is well-versed in the possibilities these new technologies will present. Most computers work to a binary code, but information in the quantum world can be much richer. Rather than ones and zeros, Romero encodes data using the shape of photons, the basic units of light. \u201cThe most exciting aspect for me is that quantum physics can lead to powerful technologies for the future,\u201d says Romero. \u201cI\u2019m exploring the possibilities to develop hacker-proof communication technologies.\u201d \u201cYou can have light of different shapes \u2013 we can make it doughnut-shaped, flower-shaped, anything you like. These shapes are like an alphabet that can encode information, and we can use them to send messages.\u201d When data is being sent using quantum communication, you can tell if it\u2019s being hacked. Information encoded in quantum systems, like single photons, is fragile. An eavesdropper can easily scramble the information being sent \u2013 the parties communicating would know there is an eavesdropper and therefore could stop sending information. \u201cTo maintain privacy, we must make sure that information is physically secure in the first place. Quantum physics can give us perfectly secure communication, that\u2019s the big picture I\u2019m working towards,\u201d says Romero. This translates to higher levels of security for our personal health and financial records, less cyberattacks and hacking of sensitive government and military information, and a more secure online experience for everyone. \u201cIn the future, if we make it more scalable, quantum communication can be used more widely in industries where secure communication is critical to their operations, like banks and government,\u201d says Romero. \u201cThat\u2019s my aspiration: to make it easier for people to have access to quantum communication technologies. I want to make hacking impossible.\u201d Are you becoming your own Tamagotchi? Riva Mendoza, a third-year undergraduate in statistics and computer science at Queensland University of Technology, also wants to utilise data to improve wellbeing. While experiencing depression, Mendoza realised that technology played a huge role for her self-care. She used her phone to track her exercise levels, mood, and sleep. She also used meditation apps for support. \u201cI was becoming my own Tamagotchi,\u201d she jokes. \u201cThere\u2019s so much data that\u2019s being collected right now by every company, every app. Data is great for tailoring ads and keeping people engaged with products, but I want to use it to improve people\u2019s overall health and wellbeing.\u201d Like Hartley and Romero, Mendoza\u2019s work has been supported by the Westpac Scholars Trust. After reading about the scholarship while she was in her final years of school, Mendoza decided to work towards securing one. Initially, the funding attracted her interest, but, she reflects, \u201cIt\u2019s so much more than that.

      "bodyText": "The government has been accused by councils of watering down plans to improve oversight of the growing number of school-aged children who are educated at home in England, leaving some of them at risk of a second-rate education or worse. The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils in England and Wales, says government proposals to introduce a compulsory register for home-schooled children are welcome but do not go far enough to protect children and ensure they get a high-quality education. In combination with the register, the LGA wants councils to be given additional powers that would enable them to enter a family home or other premises to check on a child\u2019s schooling. Without those powers \u2013 and more funding to enact them \u2013 the LGA says concerns will persist for a minority of children who could be at risk of neglect or poor future prospects. \u201cWe know that most children get a good education at home and fully support parents\u2019 rights to home-educate their children,\u201d said Anntoinette Bramble, chair of the LGA\u2019s children and young people board. \u201cBut there is a minority of cases where home-schooled children are not receiving a suitable education or being educated in a safe environment. Those children have got to be our priority. \u201cIt is good the government is introducing a register but this risks failing to protect children unless it goes further. It needs to toughen up its plans and give councils the powers and appropriate funding to enter homes or other premises to speak to children and check their schooling.\u201d Damian Hinds announced in April that parents would be required to register home-educated children with their local authority under government proposals intended to prevent young people from disappearing off the radar. An estimated 60,000 children in England are thought to be educated at home \u2013 a figure that is rising by about a quarter each year. The register will for the first time enable authorities to see where children are if they are not in school and intervene more effectively if required. Announcing the plans, the education secretary said: \u201cAs a government, we have a duty to protect our young people and do our utmost to make sure they are prepared for life in modern Britain. \u201cThat\u2019s why this register of children not in school is so important: not to crack down on those dedicated parents doing an admirable job of educating their children in their own homes, but to prevent vulnerable young people from vanishing under the radar.\u201d Home educators criticised the proposals at the time, saying a council register would be a further step down the path of unwarranted intrusion into family life by the state. They also resisted giving councils additional powers to intervene. Ministers have become increasingly concerned about growing numbers of pupils who are being \u201coff-rolled\u201d by schools, in particular families who are encouraged to take their children out of school and \u201celect\u201d home education in order to avoid exclusion or fines. The schools watchdog, Ofsted, has also flagged up concerns about more than 500 illegal or unregistered schools. In some cases, children who are said to be home-schooled will in fact be attending illegal schools. In its original consultation, the Department for Education included the possibility of giving additional powers to councils, but the proposal was dropped. The LGA has urged the DfE to reconsider and give councils the authority to investigate further.

Her father tried to visit her there but was repeatedly denied access by the guards, who also prevented him from calling his daughter, Ratcliffe said.</p> <p>Her relatives expressed serious concern on Wednesday, saying it was \u201cunusual for political prisoners to be guarded by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, rather than regular prison guards during hospital treatment\u201d.</p> <p>Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested at Tehran\u2019s Imam Khomeini airport while travelling with the couple\u2019s daughter in April 2016 and accused of spying. The Thomson Reuters Foundation employee faced charges of spreading \u201cpropaganda against the regime\u201d.</p> <p>She vehemently denied the allegation, saying she was in Iran to visit her family, and her account was backed by her employer, but she was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/09/british-iranian-woman-jailed-five-years-in-iran-nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe\">sentenced to five years in jail</a> in September of that year.</p> <p>However, she was further imperilled when Boris Johnson, the then foreign secretary who is now frontrunner to become the next prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/06/boris-johnson-mistake-could-harm-case-for-nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-say-family\">mistakenly said she was \u201cteaching people journalism\u201d</a> in Iran.

Three and a bit years later and I am admitted to a mental health clinic.</p> <p>\u201cLook at me now, I ended up in an asylum. It should be an embarrassment. Prison is getting harder and harder for me. I hate being played in the middle of a political game. I just hate it.\u201d</p> <p>The couple recently held <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jun/15/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-husband-join-hunger-strike\">simultaneous hunger strikes in London and Iran</a>. On Wednesday, Richard Ratcliffe said: \u201cNazanin hoped that her hunger strike would move the Iranian authorities, and it clearly has.</p> <p>\u201cHopefully, her transfer to hospital means that she is getting treatment and care, despite my distrust of just what pressures can happen behind closed doors. It is unnerving when we don\u2019t know what is going on.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this year, the current foreign secretary and Tory leadership hopeful, Jeremy Hunt, granted Zaghari-Ratcliffe diplomatic protection in a bid to resolve her case.</p> <p>Tensions between the two countries, already heightened, have increased yet further recently. Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/04/royal-marines-gibraltar-tanker-oil-syria-eu-sanctions\">Royal Marines helped seize an Iranian supertanker</a> suspected of carrying oil to Syria off the coast of Gibraltar.

      "bodyText": "Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman detained in Tehran for more than three years, has been transferred to a mental health ward where Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards have prevented relatives from contacting her, according to her husband. Richard Ratcliffe said his wife was moved from Evin prison on Monday to the mental ward of Imam Khomeini hospital. Her father tried to visit her there but was repeatedly denied access by the guards, who also prevented him from calling his daughter, Ratcliffe said. Her relatives expressed serious concern on Wednesday, saying it was \u201cunusual for political prisoners to be guarded by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, rather than regular prison guards during hospital treatment\u201d. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested at Tehran\u2019s Imam Khomeini airport while travelling with the couple\u2019s daughter in April 2016 and accused of spying. The Thomson Reuters Foundation employee faced charges of spreading \u201cpropaganda against the regime\u201d. She vehemently denied the allegation, saying she was in Iran to visit her family, and her account was backed by her employer, but she was sentenced to five years in jail in September of that year. However, she was further imperilled when Boris Johnson, the then foreign secretary who is now frontrunner to become the next prime minister, mistakenly said she was \u201cteaching people journalism\u201d in Iran. While he later corrected his error, it was cited as evidence against her. In 2016, a UN working group said it considered Zaghari-Ratcliffe to have been arbitrarily detained. According to those campaigning for her to be freed, she said shortly before she was transferred to the ward: \u201cI was healthy and happy when I came to Iran to see my parents. Three and a bit years later and I am admitted to a mental health clinic. \u201cLook at me now, I ended up in an asylum. It should be an embarrassment. Prison is getting harder and harder for me. I hate being played in the middle of a political game. I just hate it.\u201d The couple recently held simultaneous hunger strikes in London and Iran. On Wednesday, Richard Ratcliffe said: \u201cNazanin hoped that her hunger strike would move the Iranian authorities, and it clearly has. \u201cHopefully, her transfer to hospital means that she is getting treatment and care, despite my distrust of just what pressures can happen behind closed doors. It is unnerving when we don\u2019t know what is going on.\u201d Earlier this year, the current foreign secretary and Tory leadership hopeful, Jeremy Hunt, granted Zaghari-Ratcliffe diplomatic protection in a bid to resolve her case. Tensions between the two countries, already heightened, have increased yet further recently. Earlier this month, Royal Marines helped seize an Iranian supertanker suspected of carrying oil to Syria off the coast of Gibraltar. Last week, three Iranian boats tried to intercept a British oil tanker in the Gulf before being driven off by a Royal Navy warship.",

While official data has shown a pick-up in real earnings growth in recent months, the Resolution Foundation said household incomes had declined by 0.5% in the period from 2016-17 to 2018-19. In the past 40 years, the thinktank said, only the recession of the early 1980s and the slump during and after the financial crisis had brought a weaker performance. Household income growth had been worse than during the recession of the early 1990s \u2013 a period when real household incomes rose by 0.3% even though house prices were in the middle of a six-year decline and the pound crashed out of the European exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday in September 1992.

The Office for National Statistics said annual average earnings growth stood at 3.6% in the three months to May \u2013 comfortably exceeding the increase in the cost of living of 1.9%. The ONS said that between March and May \u2013 during which the UK was gripped by Brexit uncertainty \u2013 there had been a small rise in employment and the jobless rate had remained at 3.8%, its lowest level since the mid-1970s.

      "bodyText": "The US House of Representatives has called for an investigation into whether the spread of Lyme disease had its roots in a Pentagon experiment in weaponising ticks. The House approved an amendment proposed by a Republican congressman from New Jersey, Chris Smith, instructing the defence department\u2019s inspector general to conduct a review of whether the US \u201cexperimented with ticks and \u2026 insects regarding use as a biological weapon between the years of 1950 and 1975\u201d. The review would have to assess the scope of the experiment and \u201cwhether any ticks or insects used in such experiment were released outside of any laboratory by accident or experiment design\u201d. The amendment was approved by a voice vote in the House and added to a defence spending bill, but the bill still has to be reconciled with a Senate version. Smith said the amendment was inspired by \u201ca number of books and articles suggesting that significant research had been done at US government facilities including Fort Detrick, Maryland, and Plum Island, New York, to turn ticks and \u2026 insects into bioweapons\u201d. A new book published in May by a Stanford University science writer and former Lyme sufferer, Kris Newby, has raised questions about the origins of the disease, which affects 400,000 Americans each year. Bitten: The Secret History of Lyme Disease and Biological Weapons, cites the Swiss-born discoverer of the Lyme pathogen, Willy Burgdorfer, as saying that the Lyme epidemic was a military experiment that had gone wrong. Burgdorfer, who died in 2014, worked as a bioweapons researcher for the US military and said he was tasked with breeding fleas, ticks, mosquitoes and other blood-sucking insects, and infecting them with pathogens that cause human diseases. According to the book, there were programs to drop \u201cweaponised\u201d ticks and other bugs from the air, and that uninfected bugs were released in residential areas in the US to trace how they spread.

That loss spurred the Diamonds all the way to the trophy.</p> <p>In Liverpool, the Malawi Queens were outrun and outclassed by a Diamonds outfit which had to generate its own momentum after quarter-time, when the game was all-but won with the scoreboard at 21-2.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s starting line was captain Caitlin Bassett at shooter, who came into the match with 92% accuracy and Gretel Tippett at goal attack.

Hadley looked keen to impress and had eight feeds.</p> <p>Under suffocating defensive pressure, the Queens managed just three in the second, while the Australian shooters and a rampaging Watson continued to dominate. The quarter ended 41-5, with the Diamonds having caused 24 turnovers.</p> <p>Alexander made a raft of changes at half-time, leaving just Bruce, Watson and Price from the starting seven and it took a while to settle. Meanwhile, Malawi put on nine goals, most care of new shooter Sindi Simtowe.</p> <p>After a slow start, Caitlin Thwaites and Steph Wood picked up where Bassett and Tippett left off, scoring 14/14 and 6/6 respectively, with good service from Kelsey Browne. It was 61-14 at the last break. In the last, the Diamonds scored just 13 as the Queens managed 11; something to work on.</p> <p>After the New Zealand game, Australia will face England or South Africa in a semi-final later in the week. It\u2019s game on.</p>",

Winning may set up a run for the title or a loss could galvanise a team, as happened at the 2015 Cup in Sydney. Then, the Kiwis beat Australia early in the tournament in what has gone down as the \u201cpoking the bear\u201d match. That loss spurred the Diamonds all the way to the trophy. In Liverpool, the Malawi Queens were outrun and outclassed by a Diamonds outfit which had to generate its own momentum after quarter-time, when the game was all-but won with the scoreboard at 21-2. Australia\u2019s starting line was captain Caitlin Bassett at shooter, who came into the match with 92% accuracy and Gretel Tippett at goal attack. Paige Hadley started at wing attack and Liz Watson took centre. With April Brandley missing after injuring her ear during the Barbados match, Jo Weston started at goal defence, with Courtney Bruce at keeper and Jamie-Lee Price at wing defence. Keeping Malawi to a tournament-equal low of just two goals, Australia made a sharp start in the first, with Bassett scoring 14/14 and Tippett 7/7. Hadley looked keen to impress and had eight feeds. Under suffocating defensive pressure, the Queens managed just three in the second, while the Australian shooters and a rampaging Watson continued to dominate. The quarter ended 41-5, with the Diamonds having caused 24 turnovers. Alexander made a raft of changes at half-time, leaving just Bruce, Watson and Price from the starting seven and it took a while to settle. Meanwhile, Malawi put on nine goals, most care of new shooter Sindi Simtowe. After a slow start, Caitlin Thwaites and Steph Wood picked up where Bassett and Tippett left off, scoring 14/14 and 6/6 respectively, with good service from Kelsey Browne. It was 61-14 at the last break. In the last, the Diamonds scored just 13 as the Queens managed 11; something to work on. After the New Zealand game, Australia will face England or South Africa in a semi-final later in the week. It\u2019s game on.",

Much the most fascinating character is Hannah, unforgettably played by Eileen Atkins in Richard Eyre\u2019s 1992 National Theatre revival. Lia Williams brings her own particular qualities to the role \u2013 suggesting an inner toughness and sharp wit beneath this spry, bird-like solitary. When a trussed-up Shannon claims, \u201cA man can die of panic,\u201d Williams quickly retorts: \u201cNot if he enjoys it as much as you.\u201d Even if her accent occasionally veers from old Scotland to New England, Williams renders Hannah\u2019s account of her two brief sexual encounters with a deeply touching acceptance of the waywardness of human passion. Anna Gunn, best known as Skyler White in Breaking Bad, lends the proprietary Maxine a radiant sensuality that belies her profound loneliness and rampant jealousy. Julian Glover hints at a wicked humour in the nonagenarian poet and reads his final poem with great dignity, while Finty Williams invests a mercilessly abused vocal teacher with a justified outrage. Rae Smith has created a monumental set dominated by a sheer, weather-beaten cliff and Neil Austin\u2019s lighting, poetically capturing the stormy sunsets of the tropics, is as moving as anything in the evening. It is all very well done. Yet, while this is often described as Williams\u2019s last really good play, it carries intimations of his decline. It is full of underdeveloped characters, including a quartet of cartoonish German tourists noisily rejoicing in the bombing of London. The parallel between the captive iguana, tied by the throat and craving freedom, and Hannah\u2019s dying grandfather is also remorselessly spelt out. I felt as I did at a recent revival of Orpheus Descending: this may not be vintage Williams, but it survives through its opportunities for actors and the author\u2019s boundless charity. \u2022 At No\u00ebl Coward theatre, London, until 28 September.",

He had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2015. The Grammy-nominated singer, sometimes called the \u201cWhite Zulu\u201d, died peacefully at home in Johannesburg on Tuesday with his family, according to Clegg\u2019s manager, Roddy Quin. \u201cJohnny leaves deep footprints in the hearts of every person that considers himself or herself to be an African,\u201d Quinn told AFP.

Clegg was born in 1953 in Bacup, near Manchester. His mother was a jazz singer from Zimbabwe (then Southern Rhodesia).

Clegg\u2019s reputation as a \u201cZulu guitarist\u201d led to a meeting with self-taught street musician Sipho Mchunu, another migrant worker, and the pair went on to found the band Juluka, which means \u201csweat\u201d in Zulu. Challenging apartheid laws that prohibited mixed-race performances in public venues, they played at universities, church halls and migrant hostels. They were subject to harassment from the authorities and sometimes arrest. In 1979 they released their first album Universal Men, when Clegg turned professional. Juluka\u2019s music received little airplay in South Africa but reached large international audiences through 1982-1983 tours of Europe and North America. The song Scatterlings of Africa charted in England and France, where Clegg was particularly celebrated. The 1987 hit Asimbonanga, a tribute to Nelson Mandela, who at the time had been imprisoned on Robben Island for over two decades, was one of the high points of a glittering career.

      "bodyText": "A second Republican candidate for Mississippi governor has said he will not meet alone with a woman who is not his wife. The former Mississippi supreme court Justice Bill Waller Jr says he tries to have at least one staff person with him in both professional and social settings when a woman is present, including when he meets with a female colleague on the court. \u201cI just think it\u2019s common sense,\u201d Waller said in a campaign video. \u201cIn this day and time, I think that appearances are important, I think transparency is important, and people need to have comfort of what\u2019s going on in government between employees and people,\u201d he added. Last week another Republican gubernatorial candidate, state congressman Robert Foster, said that he would not allow a female reporter to join his campaign unless she brought a male colleague. A campaign spokesman for Waller said the candidate follows the rule because he \u201cbelieves this is respectful to his wife\u201d. The practice follows an example set by the evangelical preacher Billy Graham but has become known as the \u201cPence rule\u201d after Vice-President Mike Pence. In March Karen Pence revealed to the Washington Post that her husband follows the rule. When news of Foster\u2019s clash with a journalist broke, it created national headlines. Foster denied the practice was sexist, arguing that his stand was about avoiding \u201cany situation that may evoke suspicion of compromise of our marriage\u201d. The reporter who Foster said he chose not to be alone with was Mississippi Today\u2019s Larrison Campbell, who on Monday posted a video on Twitter of Waller confirming his adherence. A third Republican candidate in the Mississippi governor\u2019s race, Lieutenant Governor Tate Reeves, has declined to comment on his attitude toward the practice. But the leading Democrat in the field, the attorney general, Jim Hood, said in a statement that \u201cto even be having this conversation is ridiculous\u201d. \u201cIf I couldn\u2019t meet with women alone to discuss issues important to them and to Mississippi, I wouldn\u2019t be able to do my job,\u201d Hood said. \u201cAs governor, women will play an important role in my administration.

      "bodyText": "Peru\u2019s former president Alejandro Toledo has been arrested in the United States following an extradition request from his home country where he faces corruption charges. Toledo, who governed from 2001 to 2006, was arrested in northern California on Tuesday and ordered held in custody pending a hearing on Friday, according to the US justice department. The former president is a fugitive from Peruvian justice for allegedly receiving $20m from Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction company at the center of Latin America\u2019s biggest corruption scandal. Odebrecht has admitted to paying $800m to officials throughout the region in exchange for lucrative public works contracts. Peru formally requested his extradition from the United States a year ago. \u201cThis will be the ex-president\u2019s first appearance before US judicial authorities, as part of the process aiming to return him to the country,\u201d the public ministry said in a post. Toledo is one of four former Peruvian presidents to be sucked into the vast Odebrecht scandal: Pedro Pablo Kuczynski was arrested in April over allegations of bribery linked to the investigation. His predecessor Ollanta Humala was detained in 2017 and awaits trial. Humala\u2019s predecessor, Al\u00e1n Garc\u00eda, shot himself in the head to avoid arrest in April, also in connection with alleged bribes from the Brazilian builder. Heriberto Ben\u00edtez, Toledo\u2019s lawyer in Lima, told local radio station RPP that the defense will try to show that the ex-president faces political persecution in Peru. Toledo, 73, has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. He had been a visiting scholar at Stanford University as recently as 2017, though the school has said it was an unpaid position. In March, the San Mateo county sheriff\u2019s office said Toledo was arrested on suspicion of public intoxication and was briefly detained.",

Esper, a military veteran and former arms industry lobbyist, will be the first Senate-confirmed defence secretary the Trump administration has had since James Mattis stepped down at the beginning of the year. His confirmation appeared almost certain on Tuesday at a mostly friendly Senate hearing where he received significant Democratic support. Esper was unequivocal in saying that the AUMF referred to fighting non-state terrorist groups, and not entire nations like Iran. He added, however, that the president has constitutional authority to respond to an attack on US troops or interests. But Esper stressed: \u201cI agree we do not want war with Iran, we are not seeking war with Iran, we need to get back on the diplomatic channel.\u201d He said the US might be interested in negotiating a variant on the 2015 nuclear deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which included limits on Iran\u2019s ballistic missile programme. Trump took the US out of the JCPOA in May last year, and has been seeking to impose a campaign of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on Tehran ever since. But on Tuesday, he insisted that he was not looking to oust the current regime. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking, by the way, for regime change,\u201d he told journalists. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work out too well. We\u2019re not looking for that at all. They can\u2019t have nuclear weapons. They can\u2019t be testing ballistic missiles, which right now under that agreement \u2026 they\u2019d be able to do. We want them to get out of Yemen.\u201d Sitting at the cabinet table with Trump, Pompeo claimed that: \u201cFor the first time \u2026 the Iranians said they are ready to negotiate on their missile program.\u201d That was quickly denied by the Iranian mission to the United Nations, denouncing a press report suggesting that Tehran was open to missile negotiations, which may have been the source of Pompeo\u2019s comments. In a written statement, the mission said that the press report had misinterpreted comments by the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, who told NBC News: \u201cif the US wants to talk about missiles, it should stop selling weapons, including missiles, to regional states.\u201d The statement said the comments were not an actual offer to negotiate. \u201cIran\u2019s missiles and its missiles are absolutely and under no condition negotiable with anyone or any country, period,\u201d it said.",

But while some relatives expressed relief, others said the money would not compensate the loss of loved ones and expressed hope that ongoing criminal investigations would lead to prosecutions. \u201cYou can\u2019t pay for the loss of my son\u2019s life. You can\u2019t pay for the plans and dreams he had for the future,\u201d said Maraliz Fernandes, 60, whose son, the Vale geologist Wanderson da Silva, 38, was killed by the wave of mining waste unleashed when the dam collapsed. \u201cMoney will not pay for my peace, which left along with my son.\u201d Enio do Amaral, 56, who lost his sister Gislene, 51, in the disaster, will receive a \u00a332,000 one-off payment for victims\u2019 siblings, but said the money would not bring her back. \u201cThis won\u2019t bring happiness for us, for those who lost brothers and sisters,\u201d he said. The sudden dam collapse on 25 January sent a river of waste pouring across the countryside of Minas Gerais state, killing 248 people. Another 22 are still missing. Vale has yet to admit any responsibility. The company is the co-owner of the mining firm Samarco, which operated another tailings dam which collapsed in 2015, killing 19 people and causing an environmental catastrophe. A criminal investigation over that disaster has not led to any convictions. According to the deal signed on Monday evening, Vale will pay \u00a3150,000 in moral damages and insurance to partners, parents and children of victims, along with collective moral damages of \u00a386m. \u201cVale reaffirms its total commitment to the prompt and fair reparation of damages caused to the families, to the infrastructure of communities and to the environment,\u201d the company said in a statement. Dependents will get a monthly pension until the date the victim would have turned 75. That will bring some financial security for Da Silva\u2019s son, Lucas, 18, but not for Maraliz Fernandes, who has developed a tumour since her son died. \u201cShe depended a lot on him,\u201d said Marconi Machado, 44, Fernandes\u2019s brother. \u201cIf Vale had invested this value in security, none of this would have happened.\u201d Employees at the dam told the Guardian that it suffered a leak six months before the disaster. That leak was among a host of problems cited in a 1 March document from federal and state prosecutors and police which recommended the suspension nine Vale employees, including the CEO, F\u00e1bio Schvartsman. A week later, Vale complied. \u201cThe causes of the break are still being investigated. Since the dam broke Vale has presented all the documents and information requested and, as the most interested in investigating the facts, will continue contributing to investigations,\u201d a spokeswoman said in an email. Federal and state prosecutors in Minas Gerais are conducting criminal investigations. Earlier this month, a committee in the Brazilian senate said that Schvartsman and Vale\u2019s chief financial officer, Luciano Siani Pires, should be charged with murder. The committee also recommended charges against 13 others and said Vale and the dam stability auditor T\u00dcV S\u00dcD should be indicted for environmental damages and corporate responsibility, Reuters reported. T\u00dcV S\u00dcD certified the dam was stable in 2018 despite concerns about drainage and monitoring. Vale has said it followed all the required safety measures. Fernando Coelho, 35, lost his father Olavo, 63 in the disaster. The two had lived and worked together, and he is now taking medicine to treat depression. He expressed frustration that nobody has taken responsibility for the catastrophe. \u201cThose who are responsible \u2013 those who should be jailed \u2013 they just pay for a lawyer,\u201d he said. \u201cMoney rules in Brazil.\u201d",

(*except, it seems, Jews).

We are saying you are accountable as leader for allowing antisemitism to grow in our party and presiding over the most shaming period in Labour\u2019s history,\u201d they said.</p> <p>The message to Corbyn in the advert said: \u201cIt\u2019s the style of your office and your followers to deny the truth of the message and shoot the messengers, whether they are party members or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jul/11/labour-whistleblower-in-30-years-ill-be-very-proud-of-myself\">whistleblowers from Labour\u2019s head office</a>. But we cannot stay silent while younger, braver party workers and members speak out.</p> <p>\u201cYou have failed to defend our party\u2019s anti-racist values. You have therefore failed the test of leadership.\u201d</p> <p>One of the signatories, Clive Soley, a former chair of the parliamentary Labour party, said the advert was necessary because the future of the party is in peril.</p> <p>\u201cI think the situation is that we either do something now or just watch the the Labour party die. It is that tragic,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at it historically, the Liberal party took two general elections to die as an electoral force. This could happen to us. The party is haemorrhaging support dramatically and its very hard to see how we stop that with Jeremy and his group leading the party.\u201d</p> <p>Peter Hain, a former cabinet minister, said he had signed the letter criticising Corbyn over antisemitism complaints within Labour because he was a lifelong antiapartheid and antiracism campaigner and someone who had supported the Palestinian cause since the 1970s.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m astonished Jeremy Corbyn has not sorted this out before and I\u2019m astonished he doesn\u2019t seem to understand how terrible this is for him personally let alone for the whole party,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Responding to the advert, a Labour party spokesman said Corbyn and the Labour party \u201cstand in solidarity with Jewish people and are fully committed to the support, defence and celebration of the Jewish community\u201d.</p> <p>The spokesman said Labour was taking decisive action against antisemitism \u201cregardless of false and misleading claims about the party by those hostile to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s politics\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cJeremy Corbyn has made clear in interviews, videos and articles that there is no place for antisemitism in the party,\u201d he added.</p> <p>\u201cJennie Formby [the general secretary] has sped up and strengthened procedures and the rate at which cases are dealt with has increased more than four-fold.

      "bodyText": "More than sixty Labour peers have taken out an advertisement accusing Jeremy Corbyn of having \u201cfailed the test of leadership\u201d over his handling of antisemitism complaints within the party. The peers, including more than a dozen former ministers such as Peter Hain, Beverley Hughes and John Reid, have addressed the advert in the Guardian to Corbyn directly, saying: \u201cThe Labour party welcomes everyone* irrespective of race, creed, age, gender identity, or sexual orientation. (*except, it seems, Jews). This is your legacy, Mr Corbyn.\u201d Representing about a third of Labour\u2019s members in the House of Lords, the signatories told Corbyn the party was \u201cno longer a safe place for all members\u201d and claimed that thousands have resigned their membership \u201cbecause of the toxic culture you have allowed to divide our movement\u201d. The advert has been taken out amid a backlash within the party about the leadership\u2019s response to a BBC Panorama documentary that aired last week, in which eight former staff members accused the Labour of failing to tackle complaints about antisemitism properly and allowing Corbyn\u2019s office to get involved in disputes. Labour strongly denied any interference by the leader\u2019s office, complained to the BBC and said the claims were made by \u201cdisaffected former officials including those who have always opposed Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership, worked to actively undermine it, and have both personal and political axes to grind\u201d. In the advert, the 64 Labour peers state that Corbyn has not opened his eyes, taken responsibility or told the whole truth when it came to acknowledging the scale of complaints about antisemitism afflicting the party. \u201cWe are not asking if you are an antisemite. We are saying you are accountable as leader for allowing antisemitism to grow in our party and presiding over the most shaming period in Labour\u2019s history,\u201d they said. The message to Corbyn in the advert said: \u201cIt\u2019s the style of your office and your followers to deny the truth of the message and shoot the messengers, whether they are party members or whistleblowers from Labour\u2019s head office. But we cannot stay silent while younger, braver party workers and members speak out. \u201cYou have failed to defend our party\u2019s anti-racist values. You have therefore failed the test of leadership.\u201d One of the signatories, Clive Soley, a former chair of the parliamentary Labour party, said the advert was necessary because the future of the party is in peril. \u201cI think the situation is that we either do something now or just watch the the Labour party die. It is that tragic,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at it historically, the Liberal party took two general elections to die as an electoral force. This could happen to us. The party is haemorrhaging support dramatically and its very hard to see how we stop that with Jeremy and his group leading the party.\u201d Peter Hain, a former cabinet minister, said he had signed the letter criticising Corbyn over antisemitism complaints within Labour because he was a lifelong antiapartheid and antiracism campaigner and someone who had supported the Palestinian cause since the 1970s. \u201cI\u2019m astonished Jeremy Corbyn has not sorted this out before and I\u2019m astonished he doesn\u2019t seem to understand how terrible this is for him personally let alone for the whole party,\u201d he said. Responding to the advert, a Labour party spokesman said Corbyn and the Labour party \u201cstand in solidarity with Jewish people and are fully committed to the support, defence and celebration of the Jewish community\u201d. The spokesman said Labour was taking decisive action against antisemitism \u201cregardless of false and misleading claims about the party by those hostile to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s politics\u201d. \u201cJeremy Corbyn has made clear in interviews, videos and articles that there is no place for antisemitism in the party,\u201d he added. \u201cJennie Formby [the general secretary] has sped up and strengthened procedures and the rate at which cases are dealt with has increased more than four-fold. Since September 2015, the number of cases that have undergone disciplinary procedures relate to about 0.06% of members. \u201cThe Labour party\u2019s comprehensive rebuttal of the Panorama programme did not in any way criticise Jewish members who have suffered antisemitism. As we said after the programme aired, we will fully investigate any complaints alleging antisemitic incidents reported by party members in interviews in the programme.\u201d The 64 peers are the latest group to put pressure on the Labour leader over the party\u2019s handling of antisemitism complaints. Labour is to hold an extraordinary shadow cabinet meeting next Monday to address concerns on antisemitism and Corbyn will address MPs on the issue on the same day. On Monday, more than 200 former and current staff, members and supporters of Labour challenged him to resign if he could not renew trust in Labour party\u2019s dealings with employees. Separately, four senior Labour peers, including Angela Smith, the party\u2019s leader in the Lords, offered to find peers to give advice on overhauling its antisemitism complaints procedures. Pressure is also coming from Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader, who on Tuesday backed a new motion which would automatically exclude members accused of racism, sexism, misogyny, homophobia or transphobia in what would be a radical overhaul of the party\u2019s complaints process. The auto-exclusion would apply where there is \u201cirrefutable evidence\u201d of discrimination and would be overseen by an independent appointee, according to the motion, which will be debated at next week\u2019s full meeting of the national executive committee (NEC). The motion was signed by Watson, and four members of the national executive committee \u2013 MP George Howarth, councillors Alice Perry and Nick Forbes and the societies representative, James Asser. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 July 2019 to clarify that the signatories of the letter comprised more than 200 former and current staff, members and supporters of Labour, not former and current staff only.",

Ministers intend to create a \u201ccomposite health index\u201d which will track whether the population\u2019s health is getting better or worse and the stark difference between rich and poor when it comes to illnesses such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease. The detailed picture of whether people are getting healthier or unhealthier is intended to enable ministers across government, in areas such as housing, transport and the environment, as well as health, to consider the likely impact of proposed policies on overall physical and mental health. Public health experts have welcomed the plan, which is outlined in the government\u2019s forthcoming green paper on prevention of ill-health, which is due to be published shortly. The index \u201cwill provide a visible, top-level indicator of health, and can be tracked alongside our nation\u2019s GDP\u201d, the green paper says. \u201cIt will measure changes in health over time and, along with other indicators, can be used by government to assess the health impacts of wider policies.\u201d The green paper says the index is \u201cpart of a wider shift towards viewing health as one of the primary assets of our nation, contributing both to the economy and to the happiness of the population\u201d. Prof Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England and the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, has championed the idea. Its adoption represents a significant shift in thinking for the government, which is expected to ramp up efforts to prevent ill-health from developing in the first place rather than prioritising treatment.

Simon Harmer, yet again, was their lock-picker \u2013 taking six for 75, his seventh five-wicket haul of the summer. His pile rises to 64. Warwickshire\u2019s fresh-faced batsmen were undone by Harmer\u2019s morning burst of four wickets in 20 balls, which included Liam Banks for his first first-class 50.</p> <p><strong>Somerset</strong>\u2019s slip-up came at Headingley, where they were comprehensively thrashed by an innings \u2013 only their second defeat of the year. Steven Patterson, the <strong>Yorkshire</strong> captain, took the big wicket of Tom Banton and Somerset folded by lunch; Patterson finished with four for 54. Yorkshire, after their first win of the season at Headingley, go third.</p> <p>There was a hint of a thrilling run-chase in the air at the Ageas Bowl as the afternoon faded to evening, until <strong>Kent</strong> lost three quick wickets in their pursuit of 152 off 17 overs. Joe Denly had frisked Fidel Edwards for six on his way to 29 off 22 balls \u2013 but when Daniel Bell-Drummond was bowled for two, the teams quickly agreed to shake hands. Earlier Aneurin Donald and Keith Barker had kept the wolves at bay with a partnership of 63, steadying the ship after <strong>Hampshire</strong> lost three quick wickets before lunch.</p> <p>In Division Two, Chris Rushworth did what he does best, charging in at full pelt, to guide <strong>Durham</strong> to their fourth win of the season. Rushworth finished what he had started on Monday evening, pocketing six for 39 and 10 wickets in the match. <strong>Worcestershire</strong>\u2019s Ed Barnard and Ben Cox (62) put on 94 in a doughty partnership to delay the inevitable, and Brett D\u2019Oliveira added 43 with Charlie Morris at the last.</p> <p>At Sophia Gardens, <strong>Glamorgan</strong> fell to their first defeat of the season after a reinvigorated Toby Roland-Jones took five for 68 to help bowl them out 257 runs short. The <strong>Middlesex</strong> man has now taken 19 wickets in two games.</p> <p><strong>Northamptonshire</strong> slid into the surprise third promotion spot by beating <strong>Derbyshire</strong> a day and a half early at Chesterfield. Luke Procter took four for 26 on a pitch marked by the ECB as below average.</p> <p>On the second day at Cheltenham, Chris Dent made 125 as <strong>Gloucestershire</strong> overtook <strong>Leicestershire</strong>.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-16T20:54:43.681Z\">at 9.54pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d2e12c98f08cf92bb7711d5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-16T18:16:15.738Z\">7.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>And that\u2019s that. </strong> A draw at Southampton to go with the other results tapped up today. Only the game between Gloucestershire and Leicestershire trundles on, with two days still to go and Gloucester slightly in the lead with four wickets in hand. Congratulations to Chris Dent for a smashing century.</p> <p>Thanks so much everyone for your comments and messages, we\u2019ll meet again in August - with Essex just pipping Somerset at the top of Division One, and a sharp-elbowed battle for promotion places bubbling up in Division Two.

      "bodyText": "As County Championship cricket pauses till late August to make way for the Vitality Blast, a timely win for Essex against Warwickshire leaves them surveying the summer from the heady heights of the top of the table. Simon Harmer, yet again, was their lock-picker \u2013 taking six for 75, his seventh five-wicket haul of the summer. His pile rises to 64. Warwickshire\u2019s fresh-faced batsmen were undone by Harmer\u2019s morning burst of four wickets in 20 balls, which included Liam Banks for his first first-class 50. Somerset\u2019s slip-up came at Headingley, where they were comprehensively thrashed by an innings \u2013 only their second defeat of the year. Steven Patterson, the Yorkshire captain, took the big wicket of Tom Banton and Somerset folded by lunch; Patterson finished with four for 54. Yorkshire, after their first win of the season at Headingley, go third. There was a hint of a thrilling run-chase in the air at the Ageas Bowl as the afternoon faded to evening, until Kent lost three quick wickets in their pursuit of 152 off 17 overs. Joe Denly had frisked Fidel Edwards for six on his way to 29 off 22 balls \u2013 but when Daniel Bell-Drummond was bowled for two, the teams quickly agreed to shake hands. Earlier Aneurin Donald and Keith Barker had kept the wolves at bay with a partnership of 63, steadying the ship after Hampshire lost three quick wickets before lunch. In Division Two, Chris Rushworth did what he does best, charging in at full pelt, to guide Durham to their fourth win of the season. Rushworth finished what he had started on Monday evening, pocketing six for 39 and 10 wickets in the match. Worcestershire\u2019s Ed Barnard and Ben Cox (62) put on 94 in a doughty partnership to delay the inevitable, and Brett D\u2019Oliveira added 43 with Charlie Morris at the last. At Sophia Gardens, Glamorgan fell to their first defeat of the season after a reinvigorated Toby Roland-Jones took five for 68 to help bowl them out 257 runs short. The Middlesex man has now taken 19 wickets in two games. Northamptonshire slid into the surprise third promotion spot by beating Derbyshire a day and a half early at Chesterfield. Luke Procter took four for 26 on a pitch marked by the ECB as below average. On the second day at Cheltenham, Chris Dent made 125 as Gloucestershire overtook Leicestershire. And that\u2019s that. A draw at Southampton to go with the other results tapped up today. Only the game between Gloucestershire and Leicestershire trundles on, with two days still to go and Gloucester slightly in the lead with four wickets in hand. Congratulations to Chris Dent for a smashing century. Thanks so much everyone for your comments and messages, we\u2019ll meet again in August - with Essex just pipping Somerset at the top of Division One, and a sharp-elbowed battle for promotion places bubbling up in Division Two. Till then, have a wonderful summer. Good night! Mission aborted! I\u2019d better go concentrate on the round-up but will pop in now and then with updates from this surprise Southampton excitement. A thriller to tide us over till late August! A lovely two hundred run partnership at Cheltenham - a hundred for Chris Dent and 81 for Tom Smith. And down to the wire at the Ageas: Kent will need 152 to win off 17 overs!!! Ok, so I think this is now the definitive T20 list. Some sensational names there. Can the Hundred really top this? I think India are still saying none of their players will be available. Some cracking T20 Blast signings: Nicholas Pooran - Yorkshire Babar Azam and Jerome Taylor - Somerset Mohammad Nabi and Adam Milne - Kent Rashid Khan and Alex Carey - Sussex Fakhar Zaman and Mitchell Marsh - Glamorgan Mujeed ur Rahman and AB de Villiers - Middlesex Ashton Agar - Warwickshire Logan van Beek and Billy Stanlake - Derbyshire D\u2019Arcy Short and Cameron Bancroft - Durham Adam Zampa and Mohammad Amir - Essex Michael Klinger and Daniel Worral - Gloucestershire Chris Morris - Hampshire James Faulkner and Glenn Maxwell - Lancashire Mohammad Abbas - Leicestershire Faheen Ashraf and Dwaine Pretorius - Northants Dan Christian and James Pattinson - Notts Imran Tahir and Aaron Finch - Surrey Martin Guptill and Callum Ferguson - Worcestershire Donald\u2019s wicket after a patient 43 off 123 balls hasn\u2019t resulted in the collapse. Yet. Hampshire 285 for eight, 139 ahead, and Kent starting to run out of time. Just spotted on twitter - Fakhar Zaman for Glamorgan! A complete Rushworth, five in the innings, ten in the match, led Durham to their fourth win of the season - they now lie fourth, just behind Northants, one point shy of a promotion position. And then there were two: DIVISION ONE Ageas Bowl: Hampshire 409-9 dec (Organ 100, Rossouw 92; Stevens 5-68) and 265-6 (Holland 69) v Kent 555 (Denly 154, Bell-Drummond 94, Kuhn 95; Edwards 5-118) Hampshire lead by 119 runs. DIVISION TWO Cheltenham: Day 2: Gloucestershire 174-2 (Dent 96 not out) v Leicestershire 252 (Dexter 56) Also, had completely missed the fact that Rashid Khan has been appointed Afghanistan captain as replacement for Gulbadin Naib. (Tea -time scores to follow) Some cracking T20 Blast signings: Nicholas Pooran for Yorkshire Babar Azam for Somerset Mohammad Nabi for Kent Rashid Khan for Sussex Fakhar Zaman for Glamorgan Mujeed ur Rahman and AB de Villiers for Middlesex Ashton Agar - Warwickshire Thanks for the shout outs - keep them coming! And they bat on at The Rose Bowl, Donald-Barker partnership now 58 and spanning nearly 30 overs... D\u2019Oliveria hanging on at The Riverside but he\u2019s only got Morris left for company ... At Cheltenham Chris Dent in the nervous nineties. Across the roses: Aneurin Donald and Keith Barker digging in at the Ageas - a partnership of 50 in twenty overs - but with the lead only 112, safety is a way away. A third-wicket partnership of nearly a hundred putting Gloucestershire in a happy place at Cheltenham this afternoon. Gloucestershire 136 for two, trail by 116. Look at this elbow and weep. Another wicket down at the Riverside - Cox for a patient 62. We know D\u2019Oliveira (14 not out) has it in him - but today? Worcs 184 for seven, chasing a fantastical 168 more. And Essex leapfrog to the top of the table - four points above Somerset. Simon Harmer adds another six wickets to his total, his seventh five-fer of the year. Essex have won seven of eight games. Warwickshire minus Sibley and Sam Hain, didn\u2019t have the bricks and mortar. What a belting cliffhanger this Championship is turning into. England women\u2019s squad for the first Ashes Test. Heather Knight (Berkshire, captain) Tammy Beaumont (Kent) Katherine Brunt (Yorkshire) Kate Cross (Lancashire) Sophie Ecclestone (Lancashire) Georgia Elwiss (Sussex) Kirstie Gordon (Nottinghamshire) Amy Jones (Warwickshire) Laura Marsh (Kent) Nat Sciver (Surrey) Anya Shrubsole (Berkshire) Sarah Taylor (Sussex, wicket-keeper) Lauren Winfield (Yorkshire) The Guardian asked its writers to fill out one those favourite World Cup moment etc questionnaires- the type of exercise guaranteed to wipe your brain clean of all knowledge it possesses. So I think it is time to do one for CCLive! that we can revisit in September. Here\u2019s mine off the top of my head - I expect I\u2019ll have missed off someone critical. Favourite match: Yorkshire\u2019s thriller v Surrey at Scarborough. Best batsman: Dom Sibley Best import: tricky... Marnus Labuschagne or Keshav Maharaj Best bowler: Jimmy Anderson or Lewis Gregory Best young player: er.. Saqib Mahmood or Jamie Smith Best comeback: Toby Roland Jone I like these spa towns. And the 96 run partnership has been broken at The Riverside, with Barnard lbw to Rimmington for 43; Rushworth is bowling from the other end. Ben Cox hangs on, 52 not out. Worcestershire are 156-6, needing another 196 to win. Ooooh-er - are we going to have a surprise at The Ageas? Hampshire\u2019s lead is only 64 with McManus now gone and Darren Stevens in danger of doing a Darren Stevens. Hampshire 210 for 6: Donald 14 not out in just less than an hour. Siddle, then Harmer - this ain\u2019t going to last long. Warwickshire 2011 for nine and five more wickets for Harmer. Gary Naylor has tweeted in I\u2019d forgotten that, but I guess partly that was the fact that they couldn\u2019t compete financially? I can\u2019t imagine a future when Free to Air TV has complete coverage but a few more breadcrumbs would be nice. Just reminded myself what the next TV deal has promised us: \u201cSky and the BBC will share live content during a five-year deal that starts in 2020. The BBC will show live coverage of 10 matches in the new Twenty20 competition, including the final, as well as two England T20 internationals.\u201d I suppose what I\u2019d really like is a Test or two to be on during the summer holidays. Someone suggested the Lord\u2019s Test, but I\u2019m not sure that would always be the best choice. Perhaps it could be a roving choice each year, giving every ground a chance to show itself off. Anyway, not likely to happen till 2025. Though, in fairness, the BBC has promised as part of the deal to put cricketers on programmes like the One Show, and CBBC. And then there were four: DIVISION ONE Chelmsford: Essex 245 (Cook 84; Rhodes 5-17) and 316-9 dec (Cook 83; Rhodes 4-38) v Warwickshire 161 (Siddle 5-33) and 171-7 (Banks 50; Harmer 4-55). Warwicks need 230 to win. Ageas Bowl: Hampshire 409-9 dec (Organ 100, Rossouw 92; Stevens 5-68) and 196-5 v Kent 555 (Denly 154, Bell-Drummond 94, Kuhn 95; Edwards 5-118) DIVISION TWO Riverside: Durham 212 (Eckersley 50, Raine 78 not out) and 290-8dec (Burnham 76; Barnard 4-79) v Worcestershire 151 (Rushworth 4-28) and 139-5 (Rushworth 5-19). Worcestershire need 213 to win. Cheltenham: Day 2: Gloucestershire 83-2 (Dent 50 not out) v Leicestershire 252 (Dexter 56) Lunch scores to follow: The third of the late morning trilogy. Yorkshire captain Steven Patterson spoilt Somerset dreams with four morning wickets - including his 400th first-class wicket. It is only Somerset\u2019s second defeat of the summer and they will slip from the peak of the Division should Essex do as expected against Warwickshire. Yorkshire\u2019s first win of the season at Headingley could turn out to be the day the Championship race twisted. A match won in Northamptonshire\u2019s first innings, which was nearly a hundred runs larger than any other in the match. In a low-scoring game, Temba Bavuma\u2019s century was the clincher. Luke Procter today\u2019s destroyer with four for 26. Glamorgan could only last an hour and a half this morning in what was always going to be a near-impossible task. The reborn Toby Roland-Jones finished with five for 68 - and ten wickets in the match - leaving Mr Boom-Boom de Lange was stranded on 45. It was Glamorgan\u2019s first defeat of the season, but they remain second in the table. I never imagined Jack Russell and Twitter... This, I think, is a Full Rushworth. 13-6-17-5. Worcestershire 115-5 need a further 237 to win. Had taken my eyes off Kent v Hampshire ... but turns out nothing much has happened. Ian Holland and Rilee Rossouw both pottering past fifty as the Hampshire lead moves on to 28. Derbyshire crumbling, Luke Procter now has four for 25. What a shame for Chesterfield \u2013 the match is going to be over with a day and half to spare. A third for Harmer, can Warwickshire (112-5) last till lunch? Gareth Roderick is run-out at Cheltenham for 22, so Gloucs are now 48-2. It always amuses me slightly when players are run-out in the first-innings of a Championship game - surely there\u2019s no need for risky tight singles? De Lange going large at Sophia Gardens... oh but that\u2019s a fourth wicket for Toby Roland-Jones. Death throes now... Two in two, it\u2019s HARMER TIME! So, you know that Tom Banton upon whose shoulders Somerset\u2019s hopes lay? He\u2019s out. Bowled by Steven Patterson for 63. I\u2019m just recovering from biting into a nectarine fresh from the fridge. Oh my teeth and gums.... Anyway, Peter Siddle wouldn\u2019t never do anything so stupid - instead he\u2019s just dismissed young Banks for that round fifty. At the Riverside, a bald 33 year old takes the ball. He lives to bowl. In he charges ... at the other end Ross Whitely holds his pose but deep down he knows it is all over. Behind him a stump has skittled along the ground. Durham are on their way. A maiden first-class fifty for 20 year old Liam Banks at Chelmsford. Well played! How great that must feel? That\u2019s not very Cheltenham! A wicket in the first over of the morning. Miles Hammond gone for a fat, unsatisfying duck. Gloucestershire 2/1. Somerset\u2019s hopes of holding out for a draw slipping away. Fisher grabs his third of the innings, Groenewald caught at point for 8. Somerset 168 for five, still 156 behind. And even if they were to get a lead, there is no Gregory or Leach to turn the screw. At Headingley, Maharaj has the ball... DIVISION ONE Chelmsford Essex 245 (Cook 84; Rhodes 5-17) and 316-9 dec (Cook 83; Rhodes 4-38) v Warwickshire 161 (Siddle 5-33) and 67-1. Warwicks need 334 to win. Ageas Bowl: Hampshire 409-9 dec (Organ 100, Rossouw 92; Stevens 5-68) and 119-2 v Kent 555 (Denly 154, Bell-Drummond 94, Kuhn 95; Edwards 5-118) Headingley: Yorkshire 520 (Ballance 111, Kohler-Cadmore 102, Brook 101; Bess 4-130) v Somerset 196 (Jamie Overton 52 not out; Maharaj 7-52) and 159-4 (Banton 58 not out) DIVISION TWO Riverside: Durham 212 (Eckersley 50, Raine 78 not out) and 290-8dec (Burnham 76; Barnard 4-79) v Worcestershire 151 (Rushworth 4-28) and 31-3 (Rushworth 3-4). Worcestershire need 321 to win. Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan 171 (Lloyd 67; Helm 5-53; Roland-Jones 4-45) and 171-6 (Hemphrey 52 not out)v Middlesex 384 (Malan 166; Carey 4-54) and 342 (Robson 140 not out). Glamorgan need 365 to win. Chesterfield: Day 3: Derby 146 (Sanderson 5-46) and 155-5 v Northants 342 (Bavuma 134) and 122 (Palladino 4-33). Derbyshire need 164 to win. Cheltenham: Day 2: Gloucestershire v Leicestershire 252 (Dexter 56) And the latest from Moeen Ali yesterday, in case you missed it. \u201cMorgs was dead right to highlight how the different opinions on such things in this dressing room are actually part of our strength. We are an incredibly diverse team from different backgrounds and cultures but, crucially, we respect this and embrace it. We never shy away from it. It doesn\u2019t matter where you come from or what you believe in, if you can come together with a common purpose \u2013 in our case winning the World Cup \u2013 and you show courage, unity and respect (our team mantra) you can achieve anything.\u201d Just wanted to point you towards this series of wonderful pictures by the Guardian\u2019s own Tom Jenkins. He\u2019s not just a fantastic photographer, but a great bloke too. Good morning everyone, it is the last CC! Live! for a while - so I hope a few of you have time to drop in. So much to talk about - is this the beginning of the end for Somerset? Much rests on Tom Banton\u2019s young shoulders. Is this the start of Essex\u2019s victory charge? Warwickshire have a mountain to climb to stop them, as do Glamorgan at Sophia Gardens. Kent have a chance of forcing a win at the Ageas Bowl; and who knows what will happen at Chesterfield where 24 wickets fell yesterday. Chris Rushworth-inspired Durham are likely to run through Worcestershire in the course of the day. At sedate Cheltenham, we\u2019re only hitting day two - Leicestershire were bowled out as the sun shone. The Surrey v Notts and Lancashire v Sussex games finished yesterday.",

      "bodyText": "Defence did not realise a firm it struck a $25,000 deal with was blacklisted in the United States for bribing American air force officials. Guardian Australia revealed on Tuesday that the defence department purchased specialist aircraft ladders from Lock N Climb, a United States firm that was found to have paid cash bribes to help secure sales at an Oklahoma airbase. The bribery prompted charges against Lock N Climb\u2019s president in 2016 and caused the firm to be barred from US government work until August 2019. In a statement on Tuesday, the defence department said it had not been aware that Lock N Climb had been blacklisted for bribery. The lack of knowledge of the US debarment is likely to raise more questions about defence\u2019s procurement processes. The contract was tiny by the department\u2019s standards, and wouldn\u2019t have undergone the same level of scrutiny as major tenders. But news of the bribery charges against Lock N Climb was easily accessible. It was announced publicly online by the US attorney in 2016.

Flood-affected areas were quarantined from Centrelink\u2019s welfare debt compliance activities in the aftermath of the natural disaster, which left three people dead and damaged more than 3,000 homes in February. But Guardian Australia has learned that this month Centrelink staff were told to resume compliance action in the Townsville region, sparking concern and dismay among some department employees and prompting the mayor to call on the government to reconsider. Michael Murray, a lawyer at the Townsville Community Legal Service, said some residents affected by the floods were now being drawn into the controversial debt recovery program. \u201cCertainly in the past few weeks there\u2019s been an increase in clients coming in to get advice about robodebts. Whether they\u2019d received a notice to confirm their income, or further down the track in that appeals process,\u201d he said. \u201cI can already see some of them were impacted by the floods,\u201d Murray added, referring to case files the legal service has on hand. \u201cYou\u2019ve got people who might have lost their homes or lost their belongings or lost their jobs as a result of the floods, they\u2019re still dealing with all of that.

We\u2019ve got a decent proportion of our community that is still struggling.\u201d Staff were told to resume compliance action in Townsville just as welfare debt compliance activities were expanded to allow the government to garnishee alleged debts through family tax benefit payments. The robodebt scheme is currently the subject of two legal challenges from Victoria Legal Aid, which is contesting the way Centrelink calculates alleged debts. The most contentious aspect of the scheme is a tool that averages a welfare recipient\u2019s employment income over an entire year to determine if they were overpaid. The tool only supposed to be used only when a recipient has not provided payslips or bank statements to calculate a potential debt. Many welfare recipients have spoken of the difficulty of accessing such documents, and there is concern that people affected by the floods will find it even more difficult to provide evidence of their past employment income. Centrelink also has the legal ability to compel companies to provide bank statements and payslips, where a vulnerable person has been unable to obtain them, but the agency has been accused of failing to adequately use the power. The government is on track to issue more than 200,000 debts this financial year and has raised about $555m. In total, about 500,000 debts have been raised, and about 170,000 have been referred to an external debt collector.

      "bodyText": "The rate of death in Australia is now the lowest it has ever been, but some specific causes of death are on the rise, according to new data \u2013 and experts say we could be doing more to fix this. Death rates in Australia have been falling for a while, and the latest figures released on Wednesday by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW), are no different. Since 1907, the death rate has fallen by 74% to an all-time low of 529 deaths per 100,000 people: While the overall death rate is falling, the composition of the underlying causes of deaths changes. Often this is related to the change in age composition of the Australian population, with better treatments for certain illnesses prolonging life. The infectious diseases category is going against the overall trend, with an increase in the death rate since the 1980s. In the historical context the number of deaths is still very low: According to a 2006 publication from the AIHW, this trend is being driven by an increase in deaths from septicaemia, HIV/AIDS, and hepatitis. This trend concerns some experts, who say we could be doing more to reduce deaths caused by infectious diseases, particularly sepsis, or septicaemia, which results when bacteria enter the bloodstream from another infection. While the advent of antibiotics reduced sepsis deaths in the middle of the century, the death rate for sepsis is now as high or higher than it was in the pre-antibiotic era of the early 1900s, and in some years it is in the top 20 causes of death. Unfortunately the AIHW does not make all of its cause-of-death data available without paying money, so this chart, converted from a 2006 report, has the longest time period available. The age composition of sepsis deaths has also changed markedly, with large increases in the 65-85 and over-85 age groups. Professor Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases expert at the Australian National University, says deaths from sepsis are likely to continue to get worse over time. \u201cOne of the factors is antibiotic resistance, and another is our ageing population,\u201d he said. \u201cBacterial infections causing septicaemia and death are going up everywhere.\u201d While sepsis is an under-recognised condition Collignon said that given where it occurs there is good reason to think we can reduce deaths. \u201cIn the early 1900s bloodstream infections had their onset in the community, now almost half happen in healthcare,\u201d he said. According to Collignon, Australian healthcare services have made good progress in some areas, like reducing Staphylococcus aureus infections. \u201cGolden staph in blood \u2013 we have dropped that by about 60% in healthcare infections,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>The debate about nuclear power in Australia flickered to life with the suggestion by the New South Wales deputy premier, John Barilaro, that small modular reactors could be constructed in regional centres. Prominent backbencher Barnaby Joyce followed up with a call for a parliamentary inquiry.</p> <p>Joyce and Barilaro <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/05/crackpot-stuff-coalition-mps-call-for-nuclear-power-inquiry-rejected-by-greens\">revived this </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/05/crackpot-stuff-coalition-mps-call-for-nuclear-power-inquiry-rejected-by-greens\">idea</a> after the release of a report by Industry Super Australia, which took as the starting point the need to replace most of Australia\u2019s coal-fired power stations by 2040. The report concluded: \u201cIt is difficult to see how the the problem can be resolved without some nuclear in the mix.\u201d</p> <p>It would perhaps be churlish to observe that the small reactors advocated by Barilaro exist only as designs and may never be built. There is a much bigger obstacle which is essentially impossible to overcome.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/22/australias-energy-future-the-real-power-is-not-where-youd-think\">Australia's energy future: the real power is not where you\u2019d think | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To make the central point as bluntly as possible: even with a crash program there is no chance of deploying nuclear power in Australia in the required timeframe. I looked at this question in a submission to the South Australian royal commission into the nuclear fuel cycle and concluded that \u201cthere is no serious prospect of Australia producing nuclear energy before 2040\u201d.</p> <p>That was in 2015, and the news for nuclear power since then has all been bad. All of the nuclear power plant construction projects under way in the developed world have experienced substantial delays (the VC Summer plant in the US has been cancelled with a loss of billions of dollars).</p> <p>Most of these projects (Flamanville in France, Olkiluoto in Finland and Vogtle in Georgia) received their initial approval around 2005, and none is now likely to start before 2020. So, to be sure of getting nuclear power going by 2040, we\u2019d need to have projects in their initial stages before 2025, in the term of the next parliament.</p> <p>To see how absurd this is, consider some of the steps that will be needed before a project could begin.</p> <p>First, both major parties need to be convinced of the case for nuclear power. That\u2019s highly unlikely but let\u2019s suppose it can somehow be done by 2020. Next, the current ban on nuclear power needs to be repealed. This ban looms large in the minds of nuclear advocates but actually it\u2019s such a minor problem we can ignore it.</p> <p>The first big problem is the need to set up, from scratch, a legislative and regulatory framework for nuclear power. That would require adapting an overseas model such as that of the US, where the nuclear industry is regulated by at least eight different acts, covering more than 500 pages. Back in the 1970s the French government could do this kind of thing by fiat, without parliamentary debate, but that\u2019s not a feasible option for Australia.</p> <p>Having passed the necessary legislation, the next task would be to establish and staff a regulator similar to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission or the UK Office for Nuclear Regulation. The only Australian body with any relevant expertise is the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation which operates a 20 megawatt (research reactor at Lucas Heights. Ansto has little or no capacity to deal with the problem of licensing and regulating commercial reactors of 1,000MW.</p> <p>Even with a massive effort, and assuming no political obstacles, it\u2019s hard to see these tasks being accomplished within five years, which would already take us to 2025. But there are many more remaining difficulties.</p> <p>Most obviously, as the Industry Super report states, we would need a carbon price or a market mechanism with similar effects, such as an emissions trading scheme. On any realistic political analysis, that\u2019s impossible \u2013 the overlap between supporters of nuclear power and advocates of carbon pricing in Australia is virtually zero. At a minimum, the adoption of a carbon price would require a change of government at the next election, which may happen though it doesn\u2019t seem likely at the moment. Even if it would occur (and assuming, improbably, that a Labor government relying on Green support could be persuaded to back nuclear power), there would be further delays before the carbon price could be put in place.</p> <p>But that\u2019s just the beginning. Before any project could be considered, it would be necessary to license designs that could be built and operated here. The processes of the NRC in the US, which were expedited in the hope of spurring a \u201cnuclear renaissance\u201d typically take three to four years.</p> <p>We could simply accept the judgement of overseas regulators, but even then we would have a problem \u2013 there may be no designs available.</p> <p>In my submission to the SA royal commission, I argued that the only serious contender for Australia was the Westinghouse AP1000. Since then, however, cost overruns and cancellation have sent Westinghouse bankrupt, almost taking its owner, Toshiba, with it. There is no serious prospect of any more plants of this design being built. Areva, which is building its EPR model in Europe, is in similar difficulty. There\u2019s a serious risk that the only contenders would be Chinese or Russian designs, which would pose some obvious problems.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/24/two-workers-exposed-to-unsafe-radiation-dose-at-lucas-heights-nuclear-facility\">Two workers exposed to unsafe radiation dose at Lucas Heights nuclear facility</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The most difficult step would be the need to identify greenfield sites for multiple nuclear power plants, almost certainly on the east coast, and go through the relevant environmental processes.

      "bodyText": "The debate about nuclear power in Australia flickered to life with the suggestion by the New South Wales deputy premier, John Barilaro, that small modular reactors could be constructed in regional centres. Prominent backbencher Barnaby Joyce followed up with a call for a parliamentary inquiry. Joyce and Barilaro revived this idea after the release of a report by Industry Super Australia, which took as the starting point the need to replace most of Australia\u2019s coal-fired power stations by 2040. The report concluded: \u201cIt is difficult to see how the the problem can be resolved without some nuclear in the mix.\u201d It would perhaps be churlish to observe that the small reactors advocated by Barilaro exist only as designs and may never be built. There is a much bigger obstacle which is essentially impossible to overcome. To make the central point as bluntly as possible: even with a crash program there is no chance of deploying nuclear power in Australia in the required timeframe. I looked at this question in a submission to the South Australian royal commission into the nuclear fuel cycle and concluded that \u201cthere is no serious prospect of Australia producing nuclear energy before 2040\u201d. That was in 2015, and the news for nuclear power since then has all been bad. All of the nuclear power plant construction projects under way in the developed world have experienced substantial delays (the VC Summer plant in the US has been cancelled with a loss of billions of dollars). Most of these projects (Flamanville in France, Olkiluoto in Finland and Vogtle in Georgia) received their initial approval around 2005, and none is now likely to start before 2020. So, to be sure of getting nuclear power going by 2040, we\u2019d need to have projects in their initial stages before 2025, in the term of the next parliament. To see how absurd this is, consider some of the steps that will be needed before a project could begin. First, both major parties need to be convinced of the case for nuclear power. That\u2019s highly unlikely but let\u2019s suppose it can somehow be done by 2020. Next, the current ban on nuclear power needs to be repealed. This ban looms large in the minds of nuclear advocates but actually it\u2019s such a minor problem we can ignore it. The first big problem is the need to set up, from scratch, a legislative and regulatory framework for nuclear power. That would require adapting an overseas model such as that of the US, where the nuclear industry is regulated by at least eight different acts, covering more than 500 pages. Back in the 1970s the French government could do this kind of thing by fiat, without parliamentary debate, but that\u2019s not a feasible option for Australia. Having passed the necessary legislation, the next task would be to establish and staff a regulator similar to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission or the UK Office for Nuclear Regulation. The only Australian body with any relevant expertise is the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation which operates a 20 megawatt (research reactor at Lucas Heights. Ansto has little or no capacity to deal with the problem of licensing and regulating commercial reactors of 1,000MW. Even with a massive effort, and assuming no political obstacles, it\u2019s hard to see these tasks being accomplished within five years, which would already take us to 2025. But there are many more remaining difficulties. Most obviously, as the Industry Super report states, we would need a carbon price or a market mechanism with similar effects, such as an emissions trading scheme. On any realistic political analysis, that\u2019s impossible \u2013 the overlap between supporters of nuclear power and advocates of carbon pricing in Australia is virtually zero. At a minimum, the adoption of a carbon price would require a change of government at the next election, which may happen though it doesn\u2019t seem likely at the moment. Even if it would occur (and assuming, improbably, that a Labor government relying on Green support could be persuaded to back nuclear power), there would be further delays before the carbon price could be put in place. But that\u2019s just the beginning. Before any project could be considered, it would be necessary to license designs that could be built and operated here. The processes of the NRC in the US, which were expedited in the hope of spurring a \u201cnuclear renaissance\u201d typically take three to four years. We could simply accept the judgement of overseas regulators, but even then we would have a problem \u2013 there may be no designs available. In my submission to the SA royal commission, I argued that the only serious contender for Australia was the Westinghouse AP1000. Since then, however, cost overruns and cancellation have sent Westinghouse bankrupt, almost taking its owner, Toshiba, with it. There is no serious prospect of any more plants of this design being built. Areva, which is building its EPR model in Europe, is in similar difficulty. There\u2019s a serious risk that the only contenders would be Chinese or Russian designs, which would pose some obvious problems. The most difficult step would be the need to identify greenfield sites for multiple nuclear power plants, almost certainly on the east coast, and go through the relevant environmental processes. Reliance on overseas models won\u2019t be of much use here. All the plants under construction in western countries are \u201cbrownfield\u201d, that is, situated next to existing plants, built last century, and approved as far back as the 1970s. In summary, it would be a heroic endeavour to get construction started on a nuclear plant even by 2030. Getting it finished and generating electricity by 2040 is virtually impossible. Fortunately, there are alternatives, though the Industry Super report dismisses them. The combination of solar photovoltaics and battery storage is already cheaper than new coal-fired power.

For many of us who have never been migrants, to have this muttered at us was the first signal that to be a visible minority means to be forever perceived as an immigrant. And that being perceived as an immigrant is bad.</p> \n<p>\u201cGo back\u201d racists are rarely intellectually capable of engaging with the question of whether the destination they deem so suitable for us actually exists. Trump\u2019s latest outburst \u2013 in which he said four congresswomen should \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1150381395078000643\" title=\"\">go back</a> and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came\u201d, is a case in point.

Yet it makes perfect sense because they are not white.</p> \n<p>The idea that Pressley, who is African American \u2013 a community which this year marks the <a href=\"http://www.400yearsofinequality.org/\" title=\"\">400th anniversary</a> of having been forcibly brought to the US \u2013 should be driven out because she has a view that Trump finds inconvenient, is exactly the racism that bigots have always expressed.</p> \n<p>It seems obvious to me that Trump knew his remarks were racist; they were intended to be so. Not only did he claim these congresswomen had other countries to go back to \u2013 when three of the four were, in fact, born in the US \u2013 he then characterised those places not only as \u201ccrime infested\u201d but with governments that are \u201ca <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1150381394234941448\" title=\"\">complete and total catastrophe</a>, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world\u201d. After a short break from Twitter, a round of golf and a chance to see the reaction, Trump then reiterated his remarks repeatedly in person, at a press conference on the White House lawn.</p> \n<p>The president denies the racism, of course. His latest tweet claims, laughably, that he doesn\u2019t \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1151129281134768128\" title=\"\">have a racist bone in his body</a>\u201d, while his Twitter feed alternates between evidence of his racism and denials of it: a Fox story celebrating \u201ccool\u201d new Republicans of colour, and a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidJHarrisJr/status/1088245376828592130\" title=\"\">video</a> of a black man wearing a \u201cKeep America Great\u201d cap denouncing the idea there is anything racist about Trump. It was truly cringe-inducing to see vice-president Mike Pence\u2019s chief of staff, asked about the ensuing row, playing the classic \u201cI have black friends\u201d card.

      "bodyText": "Pity Donald Trump. Even his racism is the most unsophisticated kind. Every black and brown person knows a \u201cgo back to where you came from\u201d racist. For many of us who have never been migrants, to have this muttered at us was the first signal that to be a visible minority means to be forever perceived as an immigrant. And that being perceived as an immigrant is bad. \u201cGo back\u201d racists are rarely intellectually capable of engaging with the question of whether the destination they deem so suitable for us actually exists. Trump\u2019s latest outburst \u2013 in which he said four congresswomen should \u201cgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came\u201d, is a case in point. For the US president to say of Ayanna Pressley, Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib, \u201cif they\u2019re not happy here, they can leave\u201d, makes no sense because the women in question are Americans. Yet it makes perfect sense because they are not white. The idea that Pressley, who is African American \u2013 a community which this year marks the 400th anniversary of having been forcibly brought to the US \u2013 should be driven out because she has a view that Trump finds inconvenient, is exactly the racism that bigots have always expressed. It seems obvious to me that Trump knew his remarks were racist; they were intended to be so. Not only did he claim these congresswomen had other countries to go back to \u2013 when three of the four were, in fact, born in the US \u2013 he then characterised those places not only as \u201ccrime infested\u201d but with governments that are \u201ca complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world\u201d. After a short break from Twitter, a round of golf and a chance to see the reaction, Trump then reiterated his remarks repeatedly in person, at a press conference on the White House lawn. The president denies the racism, of course. His latest tweet claims, laughably, that he doesn\u2019t \u201chave a racist bone in his body\u201d, while his Twitter feed alternates between evidence of his racism and denials of it: a Fox story celebrating \u201ccool\u201d new Republicans of colour, and a video of a black man wearing a \u201cKeep America Great\u201d cap denouncing the idea there is anything racist about Trump. It was truly cringe-inducing to see vice-president Mike Pence\u2019s chief of staff, asked about the ensuing row, playing the classic \u201cI have black friends\u201d card. Trump isn\u2019t racist, Marc Short insisted, \u201che has an Asian woman of colour in his cabinet\u201d. The congressional Republican party\u2019s response was deafening in its silence. On the whole, however, Americans have been fairly unambiguous about calling a spade a spade. Those who recognised that a line had been crossed included George Conway, the husband of Trump\u2019s adviser Kellyanne Conway \u2013 who wrote powerfully about his own experience of being assaulted with similarly racist remarks in his own childhood \u2013 and Will Hurd, the sole black Republican House member, who described Trump\u2019s tweets as \u201cracist\u201d, \u201cxenophobic\u201d and \u201cinaccurate\u201d. \u201cGo back\u201d racism is all of those things. But that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t incisive. As with most prejudice, it says so much more about the person making the remark than it does the intended recipient. It reveals a person who subscribes to the myth of \u201cindigeneity\u201d (that a person cannot fully belong to a nation if they\u2019re not of a certain race); that they fantasise about their multicultural nation reverting to an imagined past steeped in the fantasy of white, racial purity.

The difference between Britain and the US, however, is that while Americans are having an argument about their known problem of racism, in Britain we are still having an argument about whether an argument even needs to be had. Theresa May, who brought in the \u201cGo Home\u201d immigration vans, felt able to condemn Trump\u2019s remarks about the four congresswomen as if from a position of moral authority. Media personalities such as Piers Morgan \u2013 who has questioned my right to criticise British \u201cheroes\u201d \u2013 or columnists who say that black British figures such as Stormzy should be \u201cgrateful\u201d to be in their own country, vigorously deny racism is intended. Americans are more likely to acknowledge the existence of the kind of racism about which British people remain in denial. The problem in the US is that racism still has its uses.

Only this: in 1978 I immersed myself for one year in this seething, international, colourful city. For me, coming from the rather monotonous, white Germany, that was fascinating. \u201cFor me, London was the epitome of modernity: freedom, the joy of life, trying everything. This gave me an inner freedom that I have kept until today. And another thing I have kept: the realisation that different cultures can get on together very well.\u201d Switching to study medicine, she later worked as an assistant physician at a women\u2019s clinic in Hanover and graduated as a doctor of medicine in 1991. After she joined the CDU in 1990, on the same day her father stepped down from his job as state premier, her inner freedom made its mark on the posts she held, first as a regional and national delegate and then at the family, work and defence ministries. \u201cShe has an incredible amount of energy\u201d, said Daniel Goffart, a political correspondent for the news magazine Focus who co-wrote her biography in 2015. \u201cYou especially saw that in her bitter and protracted battle to modernise her party\u2019s view on the role of the family.\u201d Under her watch, Germany introduced a law guaranteeing every child over 12 months of age a place at a daycare facility, and a paid parental leave scheme that includes at least two months of paid leave for fathers. She forced Merkel to drop her opposition to boardroom quotas for women, even though the policy was later defeated in the Bundestag. Married since 1986 to a physician, Heiko, and mother to seven children, Von der Leyen has juggled a prolific career with family life \u2013 at the cost of popularity within her own party, some say. Instead of attending CDU summer fetes in rural Lower Saxony, said her biographer Goffart, she preferred to spend weekends at the family home in Beinhorn near Hanover when her children were still young. Among her critics, the 60-year-old Von der Leyen has a reputation as an Einzelg\u00e4ngerin, a lone wolf with an instinct for front page-grabbing interviews and photo ops, but lacking the gift to pass the inner freedom driving her career down to the teams she works with. If Von der Leyen\u2019s approval ratings have recently plummeted, making her the least popular minister in Merkel\u2019s cabinet, it is because her handling of Germany\u2019s notoriously under-funded military at times displayed those same deficiencies. When she diagnosed the troops with an \u201cattitude problem\u201d after the emergence of stories about rightwing extremist activities and hazing of new recruits, she was accused \u2013 and not only by members of the Bundeswehr \u2013 of choosing a good write-up over loyalty to her staff. \u201cIf she has a weakness, it is her tendency to excessive stage management,\u201d said Goffart. More recently, Von der Leyen grabbed negative headlines over the accusation that her defence ministry had allocated over-inflated contracts worth hundreds of millions of euros to external consultants. A parliamentary committee is investigating the ministry for accusations of nepotism, and Von der Leyen is expected to be invited as a witness in December. In Brussels and Berlin, she will have two stages to manage. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 July 2019. An earlier version said Ursula von der Leyen is not afraid to raise heckles, rather than hackles.",

She studied economics at the universities of G\u00f6ttingen and M\u00fcnster before attending the London School of Economics where she used the pseudonym Rose Ladson because she was seen as a potential target for West German leftwing extremists.</p>\n    <p>Von der Leyen then read for a medical degree, becoming a gynaecologist, and only entered politics at 42. A mother of seven, she has held government positions as labour and family affairs minister, driving forward key policies on gender quotas for company boards and improved maternity and paternity pay and rights \u2013 policies that initially won her considerable popularity.</p>\n    <p>In 2011, Von der Leyen spoke of her desire for a \u201cUnited States of Europe along the lines of federal states like Switzerland,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany\">Germany</a>&nbsp;or the US\u201d. She has since claimed that Brexit, and the loss of the \u201cpragmatism\u201d of the British in the EU, should propel the bloc towards further integration, and has voiced support for a European army.</p>\n    <p>She is a key ally of Angela Merkel, with whom she has worked since 2005. Like Merkel, she has championed the idea of a close relationship between the EU and UK after Brexit.<br></p>\n    <p>Von der Leyen, though, has been withering about those who campaigned for Brexit, Describing events since the referendum as a \u201cburst bubble of hollow promises \u2026 inflated by populists\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Ursula von der Leyen has been confirmed as the European commission\u2019s first female president and the first German in the job for more than 50 years. In a secret ballot, MEPs voted narrowly to support the German defence minister as a replacement for Jean-Claude Juncker when he steps down on 31 October. She won the support of 383 MEPs, nine votes more than required to secure an absolute majority but below the 400 threshold that would have given her a stable majority to get her policies through parliament over the next five years. She will take over from Juncker on the day that Boris Johnson, who is likely to be the next British prime minister, has said he will take the UK out of the EU with or without a deal. Von der Leyen said she would be open to Brexit being delayed further \u201cfor a good reason\u201d although she insisted the withdrawal agreement would not be renegotiated. After the announcement of the result, she said: \u201cThe trust you place in me is confidence you place in Europe. Confidence in a united and strong Europe, from east to west, from south to north. The confidence in a Europe that is ready to fight for the future rather than fight against each other.\u201d Asked whether she would prefer Johnson or Jeremy Hunt to become the next British prime minister, she told reporters: \u201cI do not know [either] of them personally and there is a golden rule which I respect that I will work in a very constructive way with every head of state and government.\u201d Von der Leyen\u2019s emergence as EU leaders\u2019 choice for the post two weeks ago had come as an unwelcome surprise to the Socialists and Democrats group, and even to some in the centre-right European People\u2019s party (EPP) of which she is a member. She had been nominated by the leaders after 50 hours of arduous negotiations despite not being one of the spitzenkandidats, or lead candidates, who campaigned before May\u2019s European elections to head the EU\u2019s executive branch. Juncker\u2019s appointment to the job in 2014, as the first spitzenkandidat, whose position relied on a the EPP\u2019s emergence in the elections as the biggest group, had been seen as an important transfer of power away from EU capitals to the European parliament. But opposition to Von der Leyen\u2019s candidacy appeared to melt away after a 30-minute speech on Tuesday morning in which she made a series of left-leaning pledges to win over the socialists and stressed the importance of her being the first woman to be nominated by the heads of state and government. \u201cExactly 40 years ago, the first president of the European parliament, Simone Veil, was elected and presented her vision of a united Europe,\u201d Von der Leyen said. \u201cIt is thanks to you, and to all the other European icons, that I present to you today my vision of Europe. And 40 years later, it is with great pride that it is finally a woman who is the presidential candidate of the European commission.\u201d Veil, a survivor of the Holocaust who became only the fourth woman to be buried in the Panth\u00e9on in Paris after her death last year, was one of France\u2019s most revered politicians, known for her battle as health minister to legalise contraception and abortion. Von der Leyen committed in her speech to ensuring full gender equality among the 28 commissioners that she would lead in Brussels. \u201cIf member states do not propose enough female commissioners, I will not hesitate to ask for new names,\u201d she said. \u201cSince 1958 there have been 183 commissioners. Only 35 were women. That is less than 20%.\u201d She went on to commit to establishing a pan-EU guarantee of free healthcare and education for every child. \u201cI know as a mother of seven that it makes a difference for their entire life if children have access to education, sports, music, healthy food and to a loving environment\u201d, she said. In policies designed to win over the socialists, she pledged to establish an EU-wide minimum wage, a fund to prop up national welfare systems in the case of an economic crisis and to ensure flexibility in the tax and spend restraints on eurozone countries. She also committed to a far-reaching environmental programme, including a \u201cgreen deal\u201d, offering billions of euros in investment and a new EU carbon border tax, with the aim of achieving carbon neutrality on the continent by 2050. In her biggest cross-party promise to MEPs, she said she would allow the parliament the right to propose legislation. \u201cAnyone who wishes to help Europe will find in me a passionate fighter by their side,\u201d she said. \u201cAnyone seeking to split and destroy our values will find a fierce opponent.\u201d Iratxe Garc\u00eda, the Spanish leader of the Socialists and Democrats group, said: \u201cWe were very sceptical when the candidate came to our group last week, but over the past days we have to admit that she embraced our group\u2019s core demands, with specific proposals for legislation.\u201d The leader of the liberal Renew Europe group, Dacian Ciolo\u0219, said he expected that fewer than five of his 108 MEPs had voted against Von der Leyen, who spoke in fluent English, French and German during the debate in parliament. Ciolo\u0219 said he had also received assurances that his fellow liberal Margrethe Vestager, a former Danish finance minister who is currently the commissioner for competition, would be appointed as an executive vice-president on an equal footing with the socialist group\u2019s Frans Timmermans. Representatives from the governing parties in Hungary and Poland criticised Von der Leyen\u2019s pledge to continue with the commission\u2019s attempt to block or reverse judicial changes in their countries. \u201cLady Justice is blind \u2013 she will defend the rule of law wherever it is attacked,\u201d Von der Leyen had told the parliament. Green MEPs were among the 327 MEPs who voted against her candidacy. Their co-chairman Ska Keller said there had not been enough \u201cgreen content\u201d to her proposed green deal. Von der Leyen, a close ally of Angela Merkel, becomes the first German commission president since Walter Hallstein served from 1958 to 1967. Martin Selmayr, the commission\u2019s German secretary general, has said he will leave his post next week.

      "bodyText": "Chris Woakes says England\u2019s players will back whatever decision Eoin Morgan makes over his future as the one-day captain after he led the team to World Cup glory on Sunday. Morgan took over the leadership of England\u2019s limited-overs sides from Alastair Cook four and a half years ago and the expectation is he will continue in his role as T20 captain until the end of that format\u2019s World Cup in Australia next year. However, with the next 50-over World Cup in India four years away, the 32-year-old may decide to hand over the reins of that team to Jos Buttler, his deputy in both short formats, before the end of the year. England do not play 50-over cricket again until January, when they face a five-match series in South Africa. There is a T20 series in New Zealand, whom England beat in the enthralling World Cup final at Lord\u2019s, starting in November. So Morgan has plenty of time to ruminate on his future. Yet Woakes insists the players are right behind their captain whatever he decides to do. \u201cThat\u2019s his choice,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s earned the right to do whatever he wants, to be brutally honest. He\u2019s only young in my eyes, but it\u2019ll be his call. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll take a bit of time to think about it and see whether he wants to or not. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s plenty of life in him yet, it\u2019s just whether he wants to. He\u2019s earned the right to make the decision on his own, it\u2019s his call.\u201d Morgan presided over England\u2019s miserable first-round exit from the 2015 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand but has since been the driving force behind the team\u2019s white-ball transformation. \u201cWe were at rock bottom after the last World Cup, and obviously we had to do something about it,\u201d said Woakes. \u201cEoin\u2019s led that from ball one and it\u2019s brilliant that he\u2019s lifted the trophy, it\u2019s almost like it was meant to be.\u201d With an Ashes series starting on 1 August, there is little time for England to celebrate. Along with a number of other World Cup winners, Woakes is expected to be rested for next week\u2019s four-day Test against Ireland at Lord\u2019s. But he insists there are no issues with the chronic problem in his right knee that requires careful management by England\u2019s medical team. \u201cIt\u2019s as good as it\u2019s been for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m good to go for the Ashes.\u201d Jason Roy\u2019s heroics at the top of the order during the World Cup will earn him a first Test call-up when the squad for the Ireland match is announced on Wednesday. Roy scored 443 runs in seven innings during the tournament and now is regarded as the time to give the 28-year-old a chance in Test cricket alongside Rory Burns, his Surrey teammate, at the top of the order. Joe Denly will also keep his place at No 3 after hitting good form for Kent in the County Championship in recent weeks. Ben Stokes, man of the match in the World Cup final, will also be rested for the Ireland Test, with Buttler likely to join him. Both will be named on Wednesday, though, in the squad for a pre-Ashes training camp this weekend at St George\u2019s Park, the England football team\u2019s training centre in Burton. Jofra Archer will be missing from both the Ireland Test and the camp after returning to the Caribbean for a week. The Barbados-born fast bowler, 24, recently lost a cousin, who was murdered in Bridgetown. He also needs rest after playing in every World Cup game for England despite sustaining a side injury midway through the tournament. Mark Wood, the Durham fast bowler, will also miss the Ireland match with a side strain, while Jimmy Anderson, who is recovering from a torn calf, will not be risked. It means Sam Curran and Stuart Broad are likely to be the most experienced bowlers in a squad that could include Essex\u2019s Jamie Porter and the Somerset pair of Craig Overton and Lewis Gregory.",

While Pinot raged against his bad luck at his own team\u2019s media conference, after an opening phase of the Tour in which he had hardly put a foot wrong, Brailsford appeared to relish the Frenchman\u2019s predicament when he spoke to the media. \u201cWe are here to race,\u201d the Ineos team principal said. \u201cI live and breathe and think all day about sticking the knife in and, when you get the chance, twisting it.\u201d Brailsford\u2019s blunt comments may yet come back to haunt him, despite a first part of the Tour that has lacked the bitterness of a year ago when French fans turned angrily on Chris Froome and what was then Team Sky throughout the Tour, after the four-time winner\u2019s salbutamol investigation was dropped. Last July, Brailsford was dragged into a slanging match with the UCI president, David Lappartient, after the then Sky team principal had compared the head of world cycling\u2019s governing body to a local French mayor and suggested that spitting by roadside fans was \u201ca French cultural thing\u201d. Brailsford later apologised. This year\u2019s Tour has seen little anger directed at Ineos, perhaps because of Froome\u2019s absence and also Thomas\u2019s easygoing demeanour. \u201cIt\u2019s a very dramatic change since last year,\u201d Brailsford said. \u201cI guess we can all speculate as to why that may be. It has been interesting to change teams because it makes you think about what you stand for. Ineos is a very different culture to Sky and we are embracing that. It feels a little bit more relaxed and a bit more open.\u201d But a frustrated Pinot has promised that he has not thrown in the towel, despite slipping to 11th place overall, a minute and a half behind Thomas, going into Wednesday\u2019s stage to Toulouse. \u201cWe are still in the game,\u201d his Groupama\u2013FDJ team manager, Marc Madiot, proclaimed as he insisted that Pinot could make up the lost time. Fighting talk that may be, yet the reality is that Pinot\u2019s team let him down while Thomas and Egan Bernal were backed by a team of all-rounders better equipped to seize the day than any other team in the race. Pinot\u2019s team of specialists, strong riders but assembled more with the heart than the head, were all at sea when Julian Alaphilippe, Thomas and Bernal moved ahead. \u201cAs the teams have reduced [from nine riders to eight] there\u2019s no slack,\u201d Brailsford said. \u201cYou need the guys who can do a bit of everything. As a team we come here with a single focus to try and win the race, we don\u2019t try to win stages. But there are other teams who spread the resources differently.\u201d Even so, rarely has a Brailsford-led Tour team been in such a good position before the first high mountain stages. With Thomas and Bernal in second and third place respectively, and only Alaphilippe between them and the yellow jersey, it is hard to imagine Team Ineos dropping the ball even with another 11 stages yet to race. \u201cWith myself and Egan second and third it has been a great 10 days,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cObviously it would be better if we were a couple of seconds behind Alaphilippe rather than a minute but other than that it\u2019s great.\u201d Meanwhile, if Thomas should unexpectedly falter, Brailsford can look to the 22-year-old Bernal, another of the new generation of riders who can master all disciplines. The Colombian, almost effortlessly it seems, retains second place with the Pyrenees on the horizon. \u201cGeraint and Chris are coming to the twilight of their careers, at 33, 34, and I wanted a new Chris Froome,\u201d Brailsford said. \u201cI took two years looking at all the younger riders, junior riders, and then managed to negotiate Egan out of his contract.\u201d \u201cGeraint has won a Tour so he\u2019s capable of doing it again. The first time should be the hardest. For Egan, all of his credentials suggest he should be able to do it, but until he does we won\u2019t know.\u201d With only Alaphilippe providing resistance to the Ineos steamroller, the first Pyrenean stage on Thursday and Friday\u2019s time trial in Pau could prove decisive. Both stages offer further opportunities to twist that knife. \u201cObviously you\u2019ve got to be more and more aware of Alaphilippe the further the race goes on,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cBut there are some big days now in the mountains and the time trial. I guess by the second rest day we\u2019ll know a lot more.\u201d",

And that is the only route to a negotiated, orderly resolution visible from Brussels. No backstop; no deal. Jeremy Hunt might have inserted some practical reality into the conversation, if only for the sake of his intellectual credibility, but instead he endorsed the central tenet of Johnsonism: the only Brexit deal worth aiming for is one that doesn\u2019t exist.</p> <p>It is not news that dignity is soluble in ambition. Hunt, like Matt Hancock and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/11/amber-rudd-drops-opposition-to-no-deal-brexit\" title=\"\">Amber Rudd</a>, has examined the price of a seat at Johnson\u2019s cabinet table and decided he is willing to pay. Others who served under Theresa May, and who understand what leaving the EU in a disreputable huff would cost the country, have made a different choice, preferring integrity on the back benches. The resistance to a no-deal Brexit will soon be bolstered by ministerial veterans \u2013 the likes of David Gauke, David Lidington and Philip Hammond.</p> <p>Even with heavyweight reinforcements, the Tory moderates do not intimidate the zealots. Pro-Europeans in the Commons have been adept in the use of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/13/parliament-is-out-of-options-to-stop-no-deal-brexit-tory-mp-oliver-letwin\" title=\"\">procedural subterfuge</a> against a no-deal Brexit, but that arcane combat does little to advance arguments for alignment with continental allies. One thing it has achieved is Eurosceptic radicalisation, sustaining tales of Westminster conspiracy against national liberation.</p> <p>Moderate Tories have won skirmishes over the legislative timetable and lost the battle for their party\u2019s soul. One reason is their culture of obedience. The insurgent spirit does not come easily to these natural parliamentary prefects, who sit at the front of the class, waiting to be picked by teacher.

      "bodyText": "If hardline Brexiteers were free to shop around for beatable enemies they probably wouldn\u2019t change much about the current state of British politics. Their preferred candidate is well ahead in the final straight of a Tory leadership contest, and his rival doesn\u2019t dare to contradict him on the issue that matters most. In hustings on Monday night, Boris Johnson ruled out any Brexit compromise based on revision of the Northern Irish backstop. And that is the only route to a negotiated, orderly resolution visible from Brussels. No backstop; no deal. Jeremy Hunt might have inserted some practical reality into the conversation, if only for the sake of his intellectual credibility, but instead he endorsed the central tenet of Johnsonism: the only Brexit deal worth aiming for is one that doesn\u2019t exist. It is not news that dignity is soluble in ambition. Hunt, like Matt Hancock and Amber Rudd, has examined the price of a seat at Johnson\u2019s cabinet table and decided he is willing to pay. Others who served under Theresa May, and who understand what leaving the EU in a disreputable huff would cost the country, have made a different choice, preferring integrity on the back benches. The resistance to a no-deal Brexit will soon be bolstered by ministerial veterans \u2013 the likes of David Gauke, David Lidington and Philip Hammond. Even with heavyweight reinforcements, the Tory moderates do not intimidate the zealots. Pro-Europeans in the Commons have been adept in the use of procedural subterfuge against a no-deal Brexit, but that arcane combat does little to advance arguments for alignment with continental allies. One thing it has achieved is Eurosceptic radicalisation, sustaining tales of Westminster conspiracy against national liberation. Moderate Tories have won skirmishes over the legislative timetable and lost the battle for their party\u2019s soul. One reason is their culture of obedience. The insurgent spirit does not come easily to these natural parliamentary prefects, who sit at the front of the class, waiting to be picked by teacher. The Eurosceptics have the temperament of troublemakers, sitting at the back. A greater problem still is lack of clarity among pro-European Tories about what they are really fighting for. There is a large number of Brexit Mensheviks \u2013 MPs who accept the referendum result but draw a line at the destructive revolutionary fervour of Ukip-style Bolshevism.

The final season of HBO\u2019s fantasy hit received mixed reviews from critics but America\u2019s television academy placed it at the top of this year\u2019s long list of shows, with recognition for actors Kit Harington and Emilia Clarke in the categories of lead actor and actress in a drama series as well as seven further actors in the two support categories. Last year the show reigned supreme with seven awards, including for best drama. The previous record for most nominations in a single year was held by NYPD Blue. HBO has also scored another record this year with 137 nominations, beating Netflix who scored 117 across the board. Game of Thrones will be battling it out to be named best drama alongside Better Call Saul, Bodyguard, Ozark, Pose, Succession, This is Us and Killing Eve.

Williams said a new industry structure, better aligning track and train and creating clear accountability was needed. He affirmed the need for \u201ca greater distance between government and running the day-to-day railway\u201d and said he was \u201clooking closely\u201d at the -possibility of a new body governing at arm\u2019s length \u2013 although he added that there were \u201cdifficult questions\u201d about its scope and place. Meanwhile, he ruled out giving Network Rail control over the trains as well as track: \u201cYou don\u2019t create a customer-focused railway by putting engineers in charge.\u201d Train operators and suppliers welcomed Williams\u2019 suggestion of an arms-length body. Labour said it backed such a body, \u201cremoved from government interference and micromanagement\u201d, but said Williams \u201cmisses the point\u201d and it should be all in public ownership. \u201cContinuing with private train operators subject to performance-related payments means sticking with a failed, unaccountable and disjointed railway,\u201d said Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary.",

      "bodyText": "The three terrorists whose rampage left eight people dead at London Bridge were lawfully shot dead by armed police officers after they ignored clear warning shouts, an inquest jury has found. During the June 2017 attack the men first ran over pedestrians on London Bridge, then stabbed Saturday night revellers in 10 minutes of carnage. It ended only after armed officers who rushed to the scene confronted them in Borough Market, only for the three attackers to charge at them clutching 12-inch knives. Dramatic video shows armed officers firing, in one case from only 60 centimetres away. They shot the ringleader, Khuram Butt, and his accomplices, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba, all of whom lived in east London. Firing continued after the attackers had been shot because they were wearing what appeared to be explosive belts, and officers feared their movement showed they were still trying to detonate them. In all, police fired 46 shots at the terrorists to end the UK\u2019s first \u201cmarauding\u201d attack, where perpetrators run through a crowded area. The explosive belts turned out to be fakes, made up of plastic canisters. At least six bullets struck both Butt, 27, and Redouane, 30. Zaghba, 22, was hit by at least two bullets. PC Sam Balfour, 25, was among unarmed officers who tracked the attackers through Borough Market. In an interview coinciding with the conclusion of the inquest, he said: \u201cWe started to shout, \u2018That\u2019s them, that\u2019s them\u2019, pointing out those terrorists, \u2018Shoot them\u2019.\u201d An armed officer identified only as BX46 told jurors he shouted words to the effect of \u201carmed police, stand still, drop the knife\u201d, believing he was in immediate danger as Butt came at him.

He said: \u201cI carried on firing until I had to deal with the third threat of Youssef Zaghba who was on top of me. \u201cI was backing away trying to create a reactionary gap when I fired and fell backwards, and as I fell backwards I fired and from the floor I fired through my legs up to his chest.\u201d PC Iain Rae said he went to handcuff Redouane as he moved on the ground while his colleague PC Tim Andrews handcuffed Butt, who was injured.

They have told me to get out and I have taken their advice and I ran.\u201d The firearms officers then used \u201clethal force\u201d to avert the danger that the terrorists would detonate explosive devices, jurors heard. Last month, the inquest of the eight victims ended with the coroner, Mark Lucraft QC, clearing MI5 and police of failing to prevent the terror attack despite having Butt under investigation since 2015 \u2013 a decision criticised by the victims\u2019 families. He did criticise the failure to erect protective barriers on the bridge to thwart a vehicle attack three months after an attack on Westminster Bridge. Lucraft, the chief coroner for England and Wales, is expected to produce a report containing recommendations to prevent future deaths. The eight victims were Chrissy Archibald, 30, from Canada; S\u00e9bastien B\u00e9langer, 36, a French chef; Kirsty Boden, 28, a nurse from Australia; Ignacio Echeverr\u00eda Miralles De Imperial, 39, from Spain; James McMullan, 32, from Brent, north-west London; Alexandre Pigeard, 26, a French restaurant worker; Xavier Thomas, 45, a French national; and Sara Zelenak, 21, an Australian national.",

Unfortunately, dealing with the procedures I\u2019ve had, and being a little bit older, it just doesn\u2019t move quite as fast when it\u2019s a little bit cooler.\u201d Yet Woods is not overly downbeat, pointing out that Tom Watson and Greg Norman have challenged at the Open even during the flickering embers of their careers. \u201cThe great thing is playing in an Open Championship, you can do it,\u201d he added. \u201cLook what Tom did at Turnberry, what Greg did at Birkdale. Even if you don\u2019t have the speed to carry the ball 20 yards any more, you can still run the ball quite a bit out there. You just have to navigate the bunkers and navigate around the golf course.\u201d And that, Woods believes, makes this the most open of Opens. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to hit the ball very far. You can actually hear it land and still roll it out there far enough. You make a few changes here and there on equipment but it opens up for anyone to win this championship because it\u2019s not overly long.\u201d And while his game does not appear quite ready to scale another peak, Woods\u2019s upbeat mood suggests that after making it back from injury to win in Augusta any success here will be an unexpected bonus. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to be able to come back and play championship golf again,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I could. And to be able to do it again in major championships makes it that much more special.\u201d",

The leak of at least 889 pages of the private chats has sunk Rossell\u00f3 into the deepest crisis of his career, nearly two years after Hurricane Mar\u00eda exposed Puerto Rico\u2019s collapsing long-neglected infrastructure and leaving several thousand dead on Rossell\u00f3\u2019s watch. Last week, two of his top former officials were arrested by the FBI on corruption charges. Police in riot gear launched teargas and pepper spray into the crowds of protesters on Monday night, local media reported. In the chats on the encrypted messaging app Telegram, Rossell\u00f3 calls one New York female politician of Puerto Rican background a \u201cwhore\u201d, describes another as a \u201cdaughter of a bitch\u201d and makes fun of an obese man he posed with in a photo. The chat also contains vulgar references to Puerto Rican star Ricky Martin\u2019s homosexuality and a series of emojis of a raised middle finger directed at a federal control board overseeing the island\u2019s finances. For many Puerto Ricans still recovering from one of the United States\u2019 worst-ever disasters, on the back of the island\u2019s biggest public financial collapse, the scandal analysts and ordinary people are calling \u201cChatgate\u201d or \u201cRickyleaks\u201d has proven to be too much. Despite widespread cynicism in Puerto Rico about politicians\u2019 corruption and self-dealing, the chat shocked residents in a way that other scandals haven\u2019t, particularly given Rossell\u00f3\u2019s image as a gentle, even meek family man, said Mario Negr\u00f3n Portillo, a professor at the University of Puerto Rico\u2019s school of public administration. \u201cEveryone woke up one day and the governor was spouting vulgarities,\u201d Negr\u00f3n said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing worse for a politician than losing legitimacy.

Even if Rossell\u00f3 survives until election day next year, it seems clear to many observers that he has been profoundly weakened and less able to deal with crises ranging from the island\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings to its continued efforts to receive federal funding to help recovery from Mar\u00eda. Late Monday, Rossell\u00f3 released a statement saying he respected the protests and was taking their message into account. \u201cUnfortunately, despite responsible calls for peaceful demonstrations by many participants, a few others decided to damage public property and assault public officials who tried to preserve order and defend the security and rights of all,\u201d he said.

But stay tuned for July numbers. July is the warmest month of the year globally. If this July turns out to be the warmest July (it has a good shot at it), it will be the warmest month we have measured on Earth.\u201d</p> \n<p>The scientists stressed that this outcome is uncertain because conditions could change in the second half of the month, but it underscores a broader pattern of steadily rising temperatures caused by increasing emissions of carbon dioxide from power plants, deforestation, cars, planes and other sources.</p> \n<p>Mann estimated the chance of a new record this month at about 50%. In the longer term, he said records would continually be broken. \u201cWe have shown in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep19831\">recent work</a> that the record warm streaks we\u2019ve seen in recent years cannot be explained without accounting for human-caused planetary warming. Those warm streaks are certain to not only continue but to worsen if we continue to burn fossil fuels and warm the planet.\u201d</p> \n<p>Nine of the 10 hottest years on record have occurred since 2000, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Data from the first six months of this year indicates this year has a 99.9% chance of entering the top five, according to Gavin Schmidt.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is clear that 2019 is shaping up to be a top-five year \u2013 but depending on what happens it could be second, third or fourth warmest. The warmest year was 2016, which started with a big El Ni\u00f1o, which we didn\u2019t have this year, so a record year is not particularly likely,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a38f0f29-4edd-426f-9e7f-3706fd5cca1e\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, forest destruction and other human activities are trapping heat and putting more energy into the climate system.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Hotter air means heatwaves are much more likely. For example, scientists now say the unprecedented heat and wildfires across the northern hemisphere in 2018 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/northern-hemispheres-extreme-heatwave-in-2018-impossible-without-climate-change\">could not have occurred without human-induced climate change</a>\u201d. In Australia, the scorching summer of 2016-17 in New South Wales was <a href=\"https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/resources/angry-summer-report/\">made at least 50 times more likely by global heating</a>, linking it directly to climate change.</p>\n    <p>Hotter air can also carry more water vapour, meaning more intense rain and more flooding.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Another important factor in the northern hemisphere is the impact of changes in the Arctic. The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/27/climate-change-human-fingerprint-found-on-global-extreme-weather\">strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves</a> (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America.</p>\n    <p>When these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Most of the planet\u2019s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons. <a href=\"https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/another-unprecedented-tropical-cyclone-and-flooding-hits-mozambique\">Record-breaking cyclones hit Mozambique</a> in March and April. The deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/13/global-warming-made-hurricane-harvey-deadly-rains-three-times-more-likely-research-shows\">three times more likely by climate change</a>. Rising sea level also means storms cause more coastal damage.</p>\n    <p>Global heating does not influence all extreme weather \u2013 natural variability still exists. <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/mapped-how-climate-change-affects-extreme-weather-around-the-world\">Carbon Brief analysed more than 230 studies</a> and found 95% of heatwaves were made more likely or worse by climate change. For droughts, 65% were definitely affected by our hotter world, while the figure for floods was 57%. It is now undeniable that global heating is causing more extreme weather.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Of the many recent temperature anomalies, perhaps the most remarkable was in the Canadian Arctic community of Alert, Nunavut, <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/heat-wave-alert-nunavut-1.5212801\">which hit a record 21C on 14 July</a>, although temperatures at this time of year are usually just a few degrees above freezing.</p> \n<p>Last month, France shattered its previous heat record during a heatwave across much of Europe that was made at least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jul/02/climate-change-european-heatwave-likelier\">five times \u2013 and possibly hundreds of times</a> \u2013 more likely by human-driven climate disruption, according to scientists.</p> \n<p>Political leaders have failed to halt the rise in emissions that is behind global heating. On Tuesday, the UK environment secretary, Michael Gove, warned that time was running out to prevent a breakdown of the climate and natural life support systems. \u201cThese twin challenges of biodiversity and climate change are massive and urgent and interrelated. The action taken so far hasn\u2019t been sufficient, but late as it may be, there is still time,\u201d he warned. \u201cThe scale of action required may be daunting, but the need to act is imperative.\u201d</p> \n<p>The UK has avoided most of the extreme heat seen in Europe in elsewhere in recent weeks. The average temperature in the first two weeks of July was 15.1C, which equals the July average, though Mark McCarthy, the head of the Met Office\u2019s National Climate Information Centre, said there might be a modest rise because the second half of the month is usually marginally warmer than the first.</p> \n<p>Concerns about rising temperatures and their impact on health are growing. On Tuesday, the Red Cross launched a new Heatwave Guide to help urban planners and city authorities reduce the risks, which are particularly great for the elderly, very young children, pregnant women and people who are socially isolated.</p> \n<p>\u201cHeatwaves are one of the deadliest natural hazards facing humanity and the threat they pose will only become more serious and more widespread as the climate crisis continues,\u201d said Francesco Rocca, the president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.</p> \n<p>Previous heatwaves have killed tens of thousands of people, including 2,500 in India in 2015 and 70,000 in Europe in 2003, according to the Red Cross.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Record temperatures across much of the world over the past two weeks could make July the hottest month ever measured on Earth, according to climate scientists. The past fortnight has seen freak heat in the Canadian Arctic, crippling droughts in Chennai and Harare and forest fires that forced thousands of holidaymakers to abandon campsites in southern France and prompted the air force in Indonesia to fly cloud-busting missions in the hope of inducing rain. If the trends of the first half of this month continue, it will beat the previous record from July 2017 by about 0.025C, according to calculations by Karsten Haustein, a climate scientist at the University of Oxford, and others. This follows the warmest-ever June, which was confirmed this week by data from the US space agency Nasa, following Europe\u2019s Copernicus satellite monitoring system. In response to the new numbers, Michael Mann, the director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, tweeted: \u201cThis is significant. But stay tuned for July numbers. July is the warmest month of the year globally. If this July turns out to be the warmest July (it has a good shot at it), it will be the warmest month we have measured on Earth.\u201d The scientists stressed that this outcome is uncertain because conditions could change in the second half of the month, but it underscores a broader pattern of steadily rising temperatures caused by increasing emissions of carbon dioxide from power plants, deforestation, cars, planes and other sources. Mann estimated the chance of a new record this month at about 50%. In the longer term, he said records would continually be broken. \u201cWe have shown in recent work that the record warm streaks we\u2019ve seen in recent years cannot be explained without accounting for human-caused planetary warming. Those warm streaks are certain to not only continue but to worsen if we continue to burn fossil fuels and warm the planet.\u201d Nine of the 10 hottest years on record have occurred since 2000, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Data from the first six months of this year indicates this year has a 99.9% chance of entering the top five, according to Gavin Schmidt. \u201cIt is clear that 2019 is shaping up to be a top-five year \u2013 but depending on what happens it could be second, third or fourth warmest. The warmest year was 2016, which started with a big El Ni\u00f1o, which we didn\u2019t have this year, so a record year is not particularly likely,\u201d he said. Of the many recent temperature anomalies, perhaps the most remarkable was in the Canadian Arctic community of Alert, Nunavut, which hit a record 21C on 14 July, although temperatures at this time of year are usually just a few degrees above freezing. Last month, France shattered its previous heat record during a heatwave across much of Europe that was made at least five times \u2013 and possibly hundreds of times \u2013 more likely by human-driven climate disruption, according to scientists. Political leaders have failed to halt the rise in emissions that is behind global heating. On Tuesday, the UK environment secretary, Michael Gove, warned that time was running out to prevent a breakdown of the climate and natural life support systems. \u201cThese twin challenges of biodiversity and climate change are massive and urgent and interrelated. The action taken so far hasn\u2019t been sufficient, but late as it may be, there is still time,\u201d he warned. \u201cThe scale of action required may be daunting, but the need to act is imperative.\u201d The UK has avoided most of the extreme heat seen in Europe in elsewhere in recent weeks. The average temperature in the first two weeks of July was 15.1C, which equals the July average, though Mark McCarthy, the head of the Met Office\u2019s National Climate Information Centre, said there might be a modest rise because the second half of the month is usually marginally warmer than the first. Concerns about rising temperatures and their impact on health are growing. On Tuesday, the Red Cross launched a new Heatwave Guide to help urban planners and city authorities reduce the risks, which are particularly great for the elderly, very young children, pregnant women and people who are socially isolated. \u201cHeatwaves are one of the deadliest natural hazards facing humanity and the threat they pose will only become more serious and more widespread as the climate crisis continues,\u201d said Francesco Rocca, the president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. Previous heatwaves have killed tens of thousands of people, including 2,500 in India in 2015 and 70,000 in Europe in 2003, according to the Red Cross.",

      "body": "<p>For a woman who preferred to remain behind the scenes, Audrey Eyton, who has died aged 83, did more to revolutionise British eating habits than any television chef in the past 40 years. A powerhouse in the nascent UK diet industry, she co-founded Slimming magazine, wrote The F-Plan Diet and used her wealth to challenge our disregard for farm animals\u2019 welfare and appetite for meat.</p> <p>Slimming magazine began as a kitchen-table operation with her then husband, Tom Eyton, in Caterham, Surrey. It was 1969 and the two faced considerable cynicism that readers would want their local newsagent to know they were worried about their weight. It was the first display of the former beauty editor\u2019s pin-sharp ability to recognise a change in public taste and the opening of a lucrative new market: within three issues it was selling 140,000 copies.</p> <p>In part Eyton\u2019s success at Slimming was due to her understanding that whatever diet fad was being discussed, slimmers craved the scientific evidence that the self-denial would work. The couple packed the editorial board with experts, including a nutritionist, medical adviser and psychiatrist. They also extended the brand across a wide range of enterprises, from a health club \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.ragdalehall.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Ragdale Hall in Leicestershire</a> \u2013 to local slimming clubs. When they sold the business in 1980, four years after their divorce, it was reputed to be worth \u00a34m.</p> <p>Two things inspired Eyton to turn her attention to high-fibre diets. One was a horror of the low-carb diets favoured since the 1960s. \u201cThere is something that stays in my mind called the \u2018Hawaiian Circle\u2019,\u201d she once told an interviewer. \u201cIt was a thick circle of pineapple with about half a pound of cheese on top. You were taught this did you good.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3ba779d423d05567757a3e5de8a2cbac07fc7dd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3ba779d423d05567757a3e5de8a2cbac07fc7dd/25_0_4967_3328/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The F2 Diet by Audrey Eyton, 2006.

The original book came out in 1982.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Lee/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The second was her son Matthew\u2019s health problems at boarding school. Eyton was convinced they were caused by a bad diet, though she failed to convince the matron that he needed to eat better food.</p> <p>The result was her 1982 blockbuster The F-Plan Diet, which built upon research by <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-denis-burkitt-1452964.html\" title=\"\">the medical scientist Denis Burkitt</a> that suggested that fibre, not reduced carbohydrates, led to slimming success. A global bestseller, the book had an immediate impact on supermarket shelves, as consumers hunted out pulses, wholemeal bread, high fibre cereals and vegetables. The book, which also led to a slot for Eyton on the BBC Breakfast Time television show, pioneered a market for evidence-based diets.</p> <p>Born in Blackburn, Lancashire, Audrey was the daughter of Evelyn and Melville Gray. Her father was a travelling salesman and both parents were animal lovers. As a child she developed a passion for horses that took her away from her \u201cpebble-dashed home\u201d to the stables, which she hung around like \u201ca groupie\u201d, she would later tell friends.</p> <p>Her father died when she was 12. Four years later Audrey left Blackburn girls\u2019 high school to work as a reporter for the Accrington Observer, where her beat included obituaries. A sign of her personal charm was that bereaved families would frequently invite her into their homes .</p> <p>By 19 she had moved to London to work for the magazine Woman, eventually rising to the role of beauty editor, though the subject did not interest her. What did fascinate her were diets, which was why, when Tom tired of working night shifts as a chief subeditor at the Telegraph, they set up Slimming. They also had two sons; the first, Richard, who was born with a disability, died after only 10 days.</p> <p>At 15 her remaining child, Matthew, was diagnosed with an obsessive compulsive disorder. Described as \u201cfiercely intelligent\u201d, he won a postgraduate place at Cambridge University, though his passion was for animal welfare.

      "bodyText": "For a woman who preferred to remain behind the scenes, Audrey Eyton, who has died aged 83, did more to revolutionise British eating habits than any television chef in the past 40 years. A powerhouse in the nascent UK diet industry, she co-founded Slimming magazine, wrote The F-Plan Diet and used her wealth to challenge our disregard for farm animals\u2019 welfare and appetite for meat. Slimming magazine began as a kitchen-table operation with her then husband, Tom Eyton, in Caterham, Surrey. It was 1969 and the two faced considerable cynicism that readers would want their local newsagent to know they were worried about their weight. It was the first display of the former beauty editor\u2019s pin-sharp ability to recognise a change in public taste and the opening of a lucrative new market: within three issues it was selling 140,000 copies. In part Eyton\u2019s success at Slimming was due to her understanding that whatever diet fad was being discussed, slimmers craved the scientific evidence that the self-denial would work. The couple packed the editorial board with experts, including a nutritionist, medical adviser and psychiatrist. They also extended the brand across a wide range of enterprises, from a health club \u2013 Ragdale Hall in Leicestershire \u2013 to local slimming clubs. When they sold the business in 1980, four years after their divorce, it was reputed to be worth \u00a34m. Two things inspired Eyton to turn her attention to high-fibre diets. One was a horror of the low-carb diets favoured since the 1960s. \u201cThere is something that stays in my mind called the \u2018Hawaiian Circle\u2019,\u201d she once told an interviewer. \u201cIt was a thick circle of pineapple with about half a pound of cheese on top. You were taught this did you good.\u201d The second was her son Matthew\u2019s health problems at boarding school. Eyton was convinced they were caused by a bad diet, though she failed to convince the matron that he needed to eat better food. The result was her 1982 blockbuster The F-Plan Diet, which built upon research by the medical scientist Denis Burkitt that suggested that fibre, not reduced carbohydrates, led to slimming success. A global bestseller, the book had an immediate impact on supermarket shelves, as consumers hunted out pulses, wholemeal bread, high fibre cereals and vegetables. The book, which also led to a slot for Eyton on the BBC Breakfast Time television show, pioneered a market for evidence-based diets. Born in Blackburn, Lancashire, Audrey was the daughter of Evelyn and Melville Gray. Her father was a travelling salesman and both parents were animal lovers. As a child she developed a passion for horses that took her away from her \u201cpebble-dashed home\u201d to the stables, which she hung around like \u201ca groupie\u201d, she would later tell friends. Her father died when she was 12. Four years later Audrey left Blackburn girls\u2019 high school to work as a reporter for the Accrington Observer, where her beat included obituaries. A sign of her personal charm was that bereaved families would frequently invite her into their homes . By 19 she had moved to London to work for the magazine Woman, eventually rising to the role of beauty editor, though the subject did not interest her. What did fascinate her were diets, which was why, when Tom tired of working night shifts as a chief subeditor at the Telegraph, they set up Slimming. They also had two sons; the first, Richard, who was born with a disability, died after only 10 days. At 15 her remaining child, Matthew, was diagnosed with an obsessive compulsive disorder. Described as \u201cfiercely intelligent\u201d, he won a postgraduate place at Cambridge University, though his passion was for animal welfare. He had mental health problems and the psychiatric treatments he received were \u201cunendurable\u201d, according to Eyton. In 1991, aged 24, he took his own life, leaving a note entreating his mother to look after the animals. She fulfilled his request by setting up the Matthew Eyton Animal Welfare Trust, which, over the past 25 years, has raised \u00a3250,000 for various animal charities. She also made a plea for the end of factory farming in The Kind Food Guide (1991), which revealed the farming conditions of animals produced for meat. \u201cI decided I couldn\u2019t spend my time weeping and the best memorial is the way you live your life. I wouldn\u2019t want to go on living if I wasn\u2019t contributing to this cause,\u201d Eyton told Juliet Gellatley, who set up the vegan charity Viva with \u00a325,000 from the trust. Through the foundation, Eyton helped to achieve reforms that have made a material difference to the lives of farmed animals, such as the introduction of CCTV cameras into slaughterhouses. However, her involvement was not only financial. She took part in demonstrations, such as against the export of live animals from Dover, and raised several rescue pigs at her home in Canterbury, Kent. Her considerable marketing nous proved invaluable, especially to vegan causes, helping the movement become mainstream through initiatives such as Veganuary. She was also a trustee of Compassion in World Farming. In 2006 she published The F2 Diet, a follow-up to her 1980s bestseller, which claimed to harness \u201ctwenty-first century cutting-edge science\u201d. However her driving passion, which she continued to work at even after her diagnosis with Parkinson\u2019s disease five years ago, remained animal welfare. Eyton is survived by her sister, Valerie, and by two nieces. \u2022 Audrey Eyton, journalist, writer and animal welfare campaigner, born 11 January 1936; died 30 June 2019",

The number of full-time employees fell by some 77000, and the number of part-time employees also fell slightly. There was a modest increase in the number of full-time self-employed workers, but the main source of employment growth has been part-time self-employment.</p> <p>This grew by a massive 104,000 over the quarter. While many jobs of this kind offer workers the flexibility that they might want, this may come at a cost in terms of insecurity.

      "bodyText": "Time for a quick recap Sterling has dropped to its lowest level since April 2017 as investors fear that Britain is going to crash out of the EU without a deal on 31 October. Amid a nervy selloff the pound fell to a 27-month low, below $1.24. It also hit a six-month trough against the euro, at \u20ac1.1063 tonight. The slump came after Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt both declared that the Irish Backstop -- a crucial party of the current withdrawal agreement - had no future. Both men vowed to remove the Backstop in a renegotiated deal. EU officials, though, insist that they are fully committed to the plan, which is meant to ensure no hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The pound was also hit by report that Johnson might seek to suspend parliament in late October. This could allow him to thwart MPs who are keen to block a no-deal Brexit. Critics, led by shadow chancellor John McDonnell, criticised Johnson and Hunt for recklessly weakening the pound in their attempt to win the Conservative Party leadership race. Remain campaigners pointed out that the weaker pound will make holidays more expensive, and also drive up the cost of imports, including food and fuel. Economists warned that the pound could continue to shed value in the run-up to the next Brexit deadline, on 31 October. Capital Economics fears sterling could slump to $1.15 against the US dollar, if Britain left the EU without a deal. Other experts warned that the UK faces a \u2018perfect storm\u2019, of Brexit chaos and a slowing global economy. There was better news for workers, though; average earnings are now at the fastest pace in a decade, at 3.6% per year in March-May. Adjusted for inflation, and real pay is rising by around 1.7% - the fastest in three and a half years. But, wages are still below their levels before the financial crisis, once you adjust for inflation. Unemployment stuck at a 44-year low too, while the employment total continued to rise. However, some experts are concerned that self-employment is rising, while the number of employees is starting to fall, suggesting a rise in precarious gig-economy jobs. Here\u2019s some other news from today: Our Politics Live blog has all the action from Westminster too: Goodnight! GW The pound\u2019s losses deepened this afternoon after Sky News reported that Boris Johnson had devised a cunning plan to stop MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit. The front-runner to become Britain\u2019s next prime minister is, apparently, considering scheduling a new parliamentary session in early November. That would mean parliament would shut down for the last couple of weeks of October - just when the Brexit deadline approached. Sky\u2019s Sam Coates reports: Boris Johnson could send MPs home for up to two weeks in October under plans being considered by his campaign. Insiders have confirmed they are looking at scheduling a Queen\u2019s speech to mark the start of a new parliamentary session in early November. Parliament is usually prorogued for between one and two weeks ahead of a Queen\u2019s speech, meaning MPs would in effect be unavailable to stop a no-deal Brexit immediately before October 31. The slump in sterling is driving the London stock market higher tonight. A weaker pound makes overseas earnings in foreign currencies more valuable. That means higher profits for exporters, in sterling terms anyway. So, the FTSE 100 index is up 44 points, or 0.6%, in late trading at 7576, near to an 11-month high. Newsflash: Christine Lagarde has submitted her resignation as head of the International Monetary Fund, effective from 12 September. That\u2019s not a big surprise, as Lagarde has already been chosen to head the European Central Bank. But it may speed up the process of selecting her successor. In a statement, Lagarde says her resignation will \u201cexpedite the process\u201d of choosing her successor. Possible candidates, such as Bank of England governor Mark Carney and former UK chancellor George Osborne, should polish up their CVs now (quite a task for \u2018Nine-jobs Osborne, I imagine). John McDonnell MP, Shadow Chancellor, has blasted Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt for weakening the UK currency with their attacks on the Irish backstop. McDonnell says: \u201cThe instability and uncertainty caused by the Conservative Party leadership contest has real world consequences. The commitment of both contenders to a No Deal Brexit makes it even more important the Government put an end to playing games with people\u2019s livelihoods and call a General Election now.\u201d With Brexit pressure building, the pound has just tumbled through the $1.24 mark for the first time in 27 months. Sterling has dropped as low as $1.2396 for the first time since early April 2017, as investors fret that a no-deal Brexit is more likely. The selloff comes as EU officials continue to resist UK pressure to remove the Irish backstop from the Brexit deal. One official has told Reuters: \u201cIf the Brits really think we are so scared of a no-deal Brexit, they are being naive.\u201d Neil Wilson of Markets.com suspects that the tough talk about no-deal Brexit\u2019s could fade as the 31st October deadline approaches - possibly giving the pound some support. Both Conservative leadership candidates are taking the hard line on Brexit to appeal to the Tory membership. As previously stated, we have to remember that once faced with the granite reality of Number 10, recalcitrant MPs and the EU, there may be a softening. How much lower could the pound go? Capital Economics have calculated that sterling could slump as low as $1.15 against the US dollar after a no-deal Brexit, down from $1.24 today. That would send inflation surging higher (as imported goods would become pricier, especially if new tariffs were also imposed). But if the UK was to leave the EU with a deal, the pound could rally back to $1.40 within a couple of years, they suggest, in a report published today. Here\u2019s their forecasts: Capital Economics also warn that economic growth would also suffer after a disruptive no-deal Brexit: In a no deal scenario, both exports and imports would plunge as delays at the ports would prevent goods from entering and leaving the country for a few weeks. Weak domestic demand in the aftermath may mean imports take longer to recover. As a result, the external sector might provide some support to the economy, but only enough to offset a fraction of the overall slowdown in GDP growth Many ministers opposed to a hard Brexit expect to lose their jobs once Boris Johnson becomes prime minister. My colleague Andy Sparrow reports that some farewell presents have already been dished out in the House of Commons: There is a real end-of-term feeling in the Commons at the moment. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, gave Philip Hammond, the chancellor, what was effectively a leaving present in Treasury questions recently - a book of radical walks. Today Greg Clark, the business secretary, gave a model car to his Labour counterpart, Rebecca Long-Bailey. Clark handed over the gift after speaking about changes to the UK automotive industry and new electric vehicle projects. Hammond and Clark are both expected to be sacked next week, largely because they are both firmly opposed to a no-deal Brexit. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, the two candidates left in the Tory leadership contest, insist no-deal must remain an option, and their comments about the backstop last night have made it even more probable. More details in Andy\u2019s Politics Liveblog: Nick Macpherson was formerly the top civil servant in the UK Treasury, helping to steer Britain\u2019s economy through the financial crisis a decade ago. He\u2019s alarmed that both Johnson and Hunt seem quite happy to \u201cdebauch\u201d the pound, in their search for the support of Conservative Party members. City brokerage BP Prime also blame Boris Johnson for today\u2019s selloff. The pound could slide further, as the next Brexit deadline (31 October) approaches, warns analyst Stephen Innes of Vanguard Markets: Sterling has been under intense selling pressure after both candidates for UK Prime Minister\u2019s position toughened their stances on the Withdrawal Agreement and the Irish backstop at the final debate which suggests the Pound will remain extremely vulnerable if the no-deal Brexit continues gaining momentum. Jordan Rochester, FX strategist at Nomura, says investors aren\u2019t convinced that Johnson will convince EU leaders to drop the backstop, if he becomes prime minister. He says: It will take a big charm offensive by Boris Johnson to move them. Hence why folks are saying this increases the risks of a no deal Brexit.\u201d Rochester also fears that the pound could become more volatile, given the political upheaval on the horizon: \u201cOver the next few weeks and months, the UK will have a new prime minister, chancellor, cabinet, Bank of England governor, budget and Brexit plan. Despite all the above, foreign exchange volumes are near historical lows once again. This is unlikely to last.\u201d Thu Lan Nguyen, a currency strategist at Commerzbank, says the chance of Britain leaving the EU with a deal are falling (just like the pound!) The pound weakness is a reaction to the two prime minister contenders opposing the Irish backstop, which dramatically reduces the chance for a Brexit with a deal. \u201cSo this leaves only two options, no-deal Brexit, or no Brexit. As both Johnson and Hunt have made clear they want Brexit, chances of a no-deal Brexit are rising.\u201d More here on Bloomberg. Johnson and Hunt\u2019s hardline pitches on Brexit have worried the City, says Vasileios Gkionakis, global head of forex strategy at Lombard Odier, the Swiss banking group. Gkionakis says the Conservative leadership race has \u201chas transformed into an arms race of who is a bigger Brexiter,\u201d Reuters reports. Gkionakis adds: \u201cThe market is pricing in a higher probability of a no-deal Brexit and an increase of economic pressure.\u201d You have the perfect storm for sterling,. The People\u2019s Vote campaign, who are calling for a second EU referendum, say holidaymakers will suffer from Johnson and Hunt\u2019s hardline views on the Backstop. They point out that the pound has weakened during the Conservative leadership campaign, in which most candidates took a hard line on Brexit. Here\u2019s the data: Euro: in April one pound on the exchanges bought \u20ac1.16, today it buys just \u20ac1.107 US Dollar: in April one pound bought $1.31, today it buys $1.242 Aus Dollar: in April one pound bought AUS$1.82, today it buys AUS$1.77 Thai Baht: in April one pound bought \u0e3f41.60, today it buys \u0e3f38.48 Wes Streeting MP, leading supporter of the People\u2019s Vote campaign, points out that a weaker pound hurts tourists heading abroad, as well as making imports more expensive. \u201cBoris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt want to impose a hard Brexit, or even a destructive No Deal on us, without giving us the final say. That won\u2019t just threaten jobs in the car industry, steel or financial services, it will hit ordinary families hard by trashing the value of the pound and sending the price of everything from petrol at the pumps to two weeks at Disneyland soaring. Streeting argues that the economic costs of a hard Brexit justify a second vote: \u201cIt is not democratic, not fair and not legitimate for this decision to be only in the hands of the 0.25% of the population who are members of the Conservative Party. With so much at stake for all of us, then the decision must be in the hands of the people with a final say referendum. This Brexit crisis has come down to a simple question about whether we live in a democracy: no one has the right to force a destructive No Deal on the country without all of us having our voice heard in a People\u2019s Vote.\u201d City traders are selling the pound in droves, after hearing Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt both put the boot into the Irish backstop in their debate last night. The backstop is a key part of Theresa May\u2019s Withdrawal Agreement, and would keep the UK locked in a customs union after Brexit if a free trade deal isn\u2019t agreed. Johnson argued last night that it can\u2019t be fixed simply though being made \u2018time-limited\u2019: \u201cThe problem is really fundamental. It needs to come out.\u201d I think the problem is very fundamental. It has been devised by this country as an instrument of our own incarceration in the single market and customs union. It needs to come out.\u201d Hunt concurred, saying: The backstop, as it is, is dead. I don\u2019t think tweaking it with a time limit will do the trick. But as Brussels is committed to avoiding a hard border in Ireland, they may not accept that the backstop has expired - and without a solution, getting a deal by 31 October looks less likely. Today\u2019s selloff is driving the pound down to the 27-year lows suffered in early 2017, in the months after the EU referendum. NEWSFLASH: The pound has just hit its lowest level against the US dollar in over two years, as fears of a no-deal Brexit grip the financial markets. Sterling has fallen to just $1.2420, shedding a whole cent today, to its weakest point since April 2017 (shortly before Theresa May called her ill-fated general election). The pound has also sunk to a fresh six-month low against the euro, at \u20ac1.107. This is a blow to any families planning foreign holidays in Europe or America this summer. The slump comes after the two men vying to be Britain\u2019s prime minister, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, both declared that the Northern Ireland backstop is \u201cdead\u201d. Hunt and Johnson both insisted last night that they would remove the backstop from a new Brexit deal, or leave the European Union without a deal. But Brussels insiders insist that the backstop will not be ditched -- raising fears that Britain will crash out of the EU this autumn. My colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll explains that the UK has already been told the plan is a non-starter: Brussels had already rebuffed such a plan when the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, who is now part of Johnson\u2019s campaign, met the EU\u2019s chief Brexitnegotiator, Michel Barnier, last week. In what was seen as \u201cspinning for a Boris plan\u201d, Barclay told Barnier that the backstop was dead five times during the meeting. Sources say he told Barner that they wanted a series of mini deals and alternative arrangements for the Irish border. He was told that was Brexit fantasy and a non-starter, and that the \u201cmini deals\u201d outlined in EU contingency plans were temporary and only covered the \u201cbare bones\u201d such as aviation, mobile phone roaming and haulier driver licences. They did not include the major issues such as trade or the Irish border. TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady is urging the government not to be complacent about the labour market: \u201cWage growth is still below pre-crisis levels. Today\u2019s figures are little consolation for workers still feeling the effects of the longest pay squeeze for 200 years. \u201cWorking people are facing huge uncertainty. With the Bank of England expecting growth to flatline, the government must act to support the economy. \u201cMinisters should raise the minimum wage to \u00a310 as quickly as possible, and increase public investment, including on public services. And unions must have the freedom to enter every workplace to negotiate fair pay rises.\u201d Andy Bruce of Reuters has also spotted that rising self-employment is making up for a drop in the number of employed workers. The Resolution Foundation have produced some neat charts showing how wages are growing across the UK economy... but still not fast enough to reach their levels before the financial crisis (once you adjust for inflation). Geraint Johnes, professor of economics at Lancaster University Management School, has spotted a significant trend -- a big jump in part-term self-employed workers. There are now 4.96 million self-employed people, an increase of 167,000 over the last year. Professor Johnes fears that some people are being driven into insecure and unreliable gig-economy work: Following the pattern of recent months, the labour market statistics exhibit a shift towards less secure forms of employment. While the overall employment level continued to rise in the three months to May of this year, the composition of this increase is a source of some concern. The number of full-time employees fell by some 77000, and the number of part-time employees also fell slightly. There was a modest increase in the number of full-time self-employed workers, but the main source of employment growth has been part-time self-employment. This grew by a massive 104,000 over the quarter. While many jobs of this kind offer workers the flexibility that they might want, this may come at a cost in terms of insecurity. As parts of the traditional engine room struggle in the current economic climate, workers may increasingly be turning to the gig economy. The 3.6% increase in basic earnings is partly driven by NHS pay rises, under the three-year pay deal recently agreed with the government after years of austerity. The recent increase in the National Minimum Wage is also a factor, pushing up earnings for low-paid staff in sectors such as wholesaling, retailing, hotels and restaurants. Ed Monk, associate Director for Personal Investing at Fidelity International, is pleased to see workers getting paid more: \u201cThe good news from today\u2019s wage data is that pay is rising by 1.4% a year in real terms, and faster for those getting bonuses. That means households are getting richer in real terms. For the jobs market the news is more mixed. The overall numbers in work was level on last month\u2019s reading, however, indicating that job creation may be stalling.\u201d But... Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, is concerned that companies can\u2019t find enough staff: \u201cThe labour market continues to be the UK economy\u2019s strong suit, amid ongoing uncertainty. \u201cHigh employment has provided uplift to household incomes, which has supported the economy in a particularly challenging period. However, the booming jobs market has inevitably shown signs of losing momentum in recent months. As more and more people have entered work, businesses have found it harder to fill vacancies, and skills shortages are now clearly evident across all sectors. David Smith of ING says construction and road haulage skills are in particular demand, meaning builders and lorry drivers can demand higher wages. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, suspects the labour market may cool in the coming months: \u201cThe jobs market seems to have defied gravity, with wages rising and unemployment falling even as growth has slowed. The big question is how long can that last. With job vacancies edging lower and firms more cautious on hiring, the pace of job creation could slow from here.\u201d A word of caution: The rise in employment may also be due to companies hiring staff rather than investing in new machinery and equipment until they know what\u2019s happening with Brexit. Employment Minister Alok Sharma says today\u2019s jobs report shows the \u201cresilience\u201d of the UK labour market (in the face of Brexit uncertainty, presumably). \u201cWages outpacing inflation for 16 months in a row, more people in work than ever before and joint-record female employment, means better prospects for many thousands of UK families and shows the continued resilience of the UK labour market. \u201cWith unemployment still falling, remaining at its lowest level since 1974, it\u2019s clear that UK employers continue to have confidence in our hard-working workforce. Sharma is also urging Britain\u2019s children to seek some work experience this summer. With many schools breaking up this week there are some great opportunities for young people to get a taste of work over the summer \u2013 boosting their CVs as well as their bank balances as they prepare for their future careers.\u201d Don\u2019t forget to get plenty of rest as well, younger readers, and perhaps some cricket in the park too. This chart shows how more women are in work across the UK than ever before -- partly due to changes to retirement ages. This shows how the jobless rate is lower than at any time since 1974. And this shows how wages are at an 11-year high -- although this falls to a 3.5 year high once you adjust for inflation (ie in \u2018real terms\u2019). The main message from today\u2019s UK jobs report is that wage are going up, and unemployment has remained low. Here are the key points: The UK employment rate was estimated at 76.0%, higher than a year earlier (75.6%); on the quarter, the rate was 0.1 percentage points lower, the first quarterly decrease since June to August 2018. The UK unemployment rate was estimated at 3.8%; it has not been lower since October to December 1974. The UK economic inactivity rate was estimated at 20.9%, lower than a year earlier (21.0%). Estimated annual growth in average weekly earnings for employees in Great Britain increased to 3.4% for total pay (including bonuses) and 3.6% for regular pay (excluding bonuses). In real terms (after adjusting for inflation), total pay is estimated to have increased by 1.4% compared with a year earlier, and regular pay is estimated to have increased by 1.7%. You can see the whole report here. Economists and commentators are welcoming today\u2019s UK jobs report, especially the rise in wages: However, there are also signs that the jobs boom may be fading. Employment growth slowed in the last quarter, rising by 28,000 in the last quarter to 32.749 million. That\u2019s the slowest increase since June-August 2018. The number of vacancies remained high, at 827,000 in the three months to June. That\u2019s the lowest levels since March-May 2018. In May alone, basic pay grew by 3.8%, much faster than inflation (which was 2% in May). Total pay, including bonuses, jumped by 3.9% during May, suggesting that workers are finally managing to drive larger pay rises out of their bosses. Breaking! Britain\u2019s unemployment rate has stuck at its lowest level since 1974, and wages growth is rising. Average earnings, excluding bonuses, grew by 3.6% per year in the three months to May, according to the latest Labour Force survey from the Office for National Statistics. That\u2019s the fastest rise in nominal wages in over a decade, since July 2008. Once you adjust for inflation, real basic wages rose by 1.7% in the quarter - the fastest since October 2015. The overall unemployment rate remains at 3.8%, as expected - the best performance since Harold Wilson\u2019s premiership. More to follow.... The pound has also hit a six-month low against the euro, scraping \u20ac1.1080 for the first time since January, as concerns over the Irish backstop build. Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at ActivTrades, says the threat of a disorderly Brexit this autumn is pushing the pound down. Sterling weakness is justified by the increasing likelihood of a no deal Brexit. Both candidates to be the next UK Prime Minister voiced their willingness to, if necessary, break away from the EU without a deal, should there be no agreement between the two parts. At the same time, sources in Brussels alluded to increased toughness between the negotiating teams in the ongoing talks. In this scenario, there may be more downside risk ahead for the Pound. Brexit worries seem to be weighing on the pound again. Sterling has lost half a cent against the US dollar this morning to $1.246, close to last week\u2019s six-month low. Even once Ryanair\u2019s new 737 Max planes arrive, passengers may struggle to spot them.... due to a discrete rebranding exercise. A Boeing 737 Max due to be delivered to Ryanair has had the name Max dropped from the livery, further fuelling speculation that the manufacturer and airlines will seek to rebrand the troubled plane once it is given the all clear to fly again. Photos have emerged of a 737 Max in Ryanair colours outside Boeing\u2019s manufacturing hub, with the designation 737-8200 \u2013 instead of 737 Max \u2013 on the nose. The 737-8200 is a type name for the aircraft that is used by aviation agencies. Shares in soft drinks maker AG Barr have tumbled by over a quarter this morning, after it shocked the City with a profits warning. The Glasgow-based company, famous for its Irn-Bru, warned that trading in the current financial year is weaker than expected. It blamed bad weather earlier this year for a 10% slump in sales over the last six months, and fears full-year profits will slump by 20%. It told investors. Trading in the financial year to date has been below our expectations. This has been exacerbated by some specific brand challenges, particularly in Rockstar energy and Rubicon juice drinks, as well as disappointing spring and early summer weather, most notably in Scotland and the north of England, and compounded further as we approach the half year when the prior year comparative weather was at its peak. AG Barr shareholder may need a sip of something stronger than a can of guava-flavoured Rubicon. Shares in the company have slumped 27% to 629p, the lowest since November 2017. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says AG Barr\u2019s sales have also been hit by price rises, having cut prices last year to absorb the hit from the UK\u2019s sugar tax. \u201cTo say this is a curve ball is an understatement. Consumer goods companies like AG Barr are supposed to be reliable compounders, with sales that turn up come rain or shine. Unfortunately the combination of price changes and a bit more rain than shine has seen sales of Barr\u2019s soft drinks trailing behind last year\u2019s performance, and profits struggling even more. In Dublin, Ryanair shares have jumped by 1.5% in early trading to \u20ac10.30 each. Traders may be relieved that the airline is taking action to address the Max delays, and perhaps also pleased that the damage isn\u2019t worse. At least Ryanair still expects to grow passenger numbers, if only by 3% not 7% as hoped before. Other airline shares are also rising, as Ryanair\u2019s capacity cuts should help them to raise their own fares (bad news for holidaymakers!). EasyJet has gained 3% and IAG (owner of British Airways) are up 2%. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says the Boeing 737 Max crisis has \u201cshattered\u201d Ryanair\u2019s 2020 planning. The airline\u2019s growth plans had been based around getting 58 of the new Max 200 jets - which are more fuel efficient than earlier models, cutting costs. But if Ryanair can only get 30 by next summer, then Ryanair simply won\u2019t be able to grow as quickly as hoped. Wilson explains: This will significantly affect passenger growth, which management says will be fall to around 3% for summer 2020 against 7% previously expected. Full year to March 2021 traffic now seen at 157m against 162m previously guided. We may also see decline in passenger growth this year as Ryanair is planning to cut capacity ahead of the 2019 winter season in readiness. Some reaction to Ryanair\u2019s announcement: Ouch. Budget airline Ryanair has announced plans to shutter some services, after being hit by the crisis around Boeing\u2019s 737 Max plane. With the 737 Max still grounded, Ryanair has been forced to slash its passenger growth forecast for summer 2020 to just 3%, from 7%. It had previously expected to take delivery of 58 of Boeing\u2019s new jets by next summer, but this has now been revised down to 30 (assuming the plane is cleared to fly again, following two crashes claiming hundreds of lives). CEO Michael O\u2019Leary warns that this disruption will forced Ryanair to stop flying to certain airports \u2014 a blow to passengers, and also staff on the ground who could be laid off. O\u2019Leary says: This shortfall in aircraft deliveries will necessitate some base cuts and closures for summer 2020, but also for the winter 2019 schedule. We are starting a series of discussions with our airports to determine which of Ryanair\u2019s underperforming or loss making bases should suffer these short term cuts and/or closures from November 2019. Here\u2019s the full story: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Today we discover how Britain\u2019s labour market is faring in the face of continual Brexit uncertainty and a slowing global economy. Economists are hopeful that the UK\u2019s unemployment remained low in the three months to May, matching the 3.8% recorded a month ago. It\u2019s not been lower since the mid-1970s. The employment total could also remain at record levels, tipped to rise by around 45,000 over the last quarter. But are workers benefitting? The City expects basic pay (excluding bonuses) to have grown by 3.5% per year, up from 3.4% a month ago. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, says strong wage growth would boost the economy. Should the wages rate tick up it should bode well for the British economy as workers who earn more usually spend more. Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADSS, expects a decent jobs report. Despite the mess the Brexit process has been in throughout the year, the labor market in Britain continues to showcase a rather robust performance and today\u2019s figures should confirm that. Economists expect job and wage growth to have picked up marginally last month while the unemployment rate probably remained steady. Also coming up today New US retail sales figures, and the latest ZEW report on German economic sentiment, could also move markets today. Finance ministers and central bankers from the G7 countries are meeting in Chantilly, near Paris. They\u2019ll be discussing European plans to impose higher taxes on US technology giants, despite a backlash from America. French finance minister Bruno Le Maire is due to discuss the issue with Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin. The White House has already opened a so-called \u201cSection 301 investigation\u201d into the measure -- that\u2019s the same tool used to underpin the trade war with China. On the corporate front, JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs are both reporting results before the Wall Street bell. The agenda 9.30am BST: UK unemployment report - expected to remain at 3.8% in March-May, lowest since 1974 10am BST: ZEW survey of German economic confidence. 1pm BST: Bank of England governor Mark Carney speaks 1.30pm BST: US retail sales for June - growth of +0.2% expected, from +0.5%",

Kay, 39, the former husband of the singer Kerry Katona, died on Saturday 6 July after claims that he had \u201ceaten a quantity of cocaine\u201d in front of staff at the Holiday Inn hotel in Sutton Weaver, Runcorn, Cheshire. His death is now being investigated by the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct. A source told the Liverpool Echo that Kay, who has a daughter with the former Atomic Kitten band member, was said to have been \u201cacting erratically\u201d the night before he died. Cheshire police were called to the hotel on the Friday night over a report of concern for his safety. Officers attended at 9.54pm, on 5 July, and spoke to staff with Kay remaining at the Holiday Inn for another night. Hotel staff went to check on Kay at 10am on Saturday and found him \u201ceating a large amount of suspected cocaine\u201d, according to the report in the Liverpool Echo. The police and the North West Ambulance service were called and Kay was taken to Warrington General Hospital for treatment, where he died. The death is not being treated as suspicious and a file will be prepared for the coroner. A police spokesperson said: \u201cAs with any death following police contact, Cheshire Constabulary has referred the matter to the Independent Office for Police Conduct. As the matter is now subject to an IOPC investigation it would be inappropriate for the force to make any further comments at this stage.\u201d The Holiday Inn said it could not comment on any specific incident but said it is supporting its staff.

Tomorrow marks the five year anniversary of the <a href=\"https://time.com/3618279/eric-garner-chokehold-crime-staten-island-daniel-pantaleo/\">homicide</a>. This refusal of an indictment is unfortunately unsurprising. Killer cops are rarely sent to jail.</p> <p>In his study on police crimes, criminologist Philip Stinson found that despite killing about 1,100 people annually, prosecutors charge on average 7 cops a year with murder or manslaughter. About 80 officers total (out of approximately 13,000 officers who killed someone) have been charged since 2005. This figure is astounding since prosecutors secure grand jury indictments at remarkable rates, 99% for federal grand juries, and most cases end in defendant pleas (97%).</p> <p>Prosecutors often don\u2019t indict because they are also law enforcement and will pay the consequences for charging one of their own.

Using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, police scholar Kristian Williams found that more truck drivers, maintenance workers, and fishers are killed every year than cops. But many juries don\u2019t care. After two failed attempts, Cincinnati prosecutors declined to prosecute University of Cincinnati police department officer Ray Tensing for shooting Sam DuBose in the face - on camera - because both previous trials had jurors who stated that they refuse to convict an officer. Tensing settled a civil suit for back pay and legal fees with the university for almost $350,000.</p> <p>Convictions are more rare. Stinson <a href=\"https://www.democracynow.org/2017/7/24/criminologist_phil_stinson_police_kill_three\">reports</a> that of those 13,000 killer cops and 83 officers were charged, and significantly less were <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/convicting-fatal-shooting-case-rare-event-article-1.3210936\">convicted</a>: \u201cIn the past 13 years, only 19 officers have been convicted and most of those convictions were for lesser manslaughter offenses. Only one officer has been convicted of intentional murder during that time period.\u201d</p> <p>And when cops <em>are</em> convicted, they barely serve prison time. Bay Area Rapid Transit officer Johannes Mehserle <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/43376251/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/ex-bart-officer-johannes-mehserle-released-after-months-prison/\">spent</a> eleven months in prison for killing Oscar Grant.

After securing the conviction, the black prosecutor <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/brooklyn-da-won-t-seek-prison-peter-liang-after-conviction-n544491\">said</a> that Liang was not a threat to public safety.</p> <p>Movements cannot look to local or federal prosecutors for relief. Donald Trump\u2019s Department of Justice did not prosecute Panteleo, but neither did either Eric Holder or Loretta Lynch in President Obama\u2019s Justice Department.</p> <p>Yet it is completely understandable why families and communities still want killers cops to go prison. In a society where the options for killer cops seem like prison or nothing, prison and punishment feel like justice. Even when we know a conviction is unlikely, I cannot imagine being someone to tell a grieving parent: \u201cI know this is hard, but we need to think about systemic change and not the individual consequences for the officer who took the life away from your child.\u201d I could not.</p> <p>Yet deep down, many of us believe that prisons can deter police officers from violence \u2013 that if we send killer cops to prison, it warns potential killer cops of their fate. But more police officers have been prosecuted in the last five years than in any point in history, and the police have still killed the same amount of people each year. According to some reports, the killings have increased. This logic affirms that prison can keep us safe and keep more Black people alive. Cops lie, but numbers don\u2019t.</p> <p>In Ferguson, we often chanted, \u201cIndict! Convict! Send that killer cop to jail! The whole damn system is guilty as hell!\u201d Myself included. Here lies a painful truth: we can\u2019t rely on these guilty systems for our liberation. Thus, police officers will rarely be found guilty if killing black people is part of the job, like stop and frisk, walking the beak, and jumpouts. Regular, everyday \u201ccommunity policing\u201d is violent.</p> <p>Rather, in these moments, I hope that we also follow traditions of organizing that seek to reduce the size of police departments, officers, and their capacity to be violent. All of the organizing for the unlikely prosecution of killer cops can drain movements of their capacity to also organize for more transformative outcomes, like eliminating encounters between police and black people, one definite way to stop officers from killing them.</p> <p>For example, <a href=\"http://criticalresistance.org/opphealthresources/\">Critical Resistance</a> and <a href=\"https://stoplapdspying.org/\">Stop LAPD</a> Spying organizes <a href=\"http://criticalresistance.org/policing-is-a-health-hazard/\">workshops</a> for people to set up emergency communities to rely on instead of calling 911.

Or would Johnson be forced, by law, to request an extension? If the EU refused an extension (unlikely, but could Johnson then attempt to sabotage that request in order force a no deal scenario?). </p> <p>Could the EU act unilaterally in this situation? </p> <p>*turned out to be not so quick, sorry!</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <p>In your question you talk about parliament legislating against no deal. Unless it passes a law requiring the PM to revoke article 50, it cannot absolutely legislate to stop no deal. One possible option might be to legislate to require the PM to either win a vote approving a no-deal Brexit or to request an article 50 extension. If that law had been passed by the time of an election, it would stand. But the EU has to agree an article 50 extension, and so the UK cannot determine that unilaterally.</p> <p>On the main point, whether an election campaign ending after 31 October would oblige the new PM to request an article 50 extension, effectively halting Brexit to allow the electorate to express its views, opinion varies. <a href=\"http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/exiting-the-european-union-committee/the-progress-of-the-uks-negotiations-on-eu-withdrawal/oral/103726.pdf\">At the Brexit committee last week</a> <strong>David Lidington</strong>, the Cabinet Office minister and Theresa May\u2019s de facto deputy, implied that the proper thing to do would be to delay. He explained:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Certainly, the convention that has been established hitherto and is reflected in the cabinet manual is that if a general election is called, whether triggered by the Fixed-term Parliaments Act or because parliament gets to the end of its term, the government from that moment goes on to a caretaker basis and does not take any significant decisions that would prejudice the freedom of decision taking by whichever government the people elect.</p> </blockquote> <p>But at the hearing the Tory Brexiter <strong>Peter Bone</strong> strongly objected to Lidington\u2019s interpretation. If Boris Johnson were PM, he could argue that he was elected leader with a mandate to leave the EU by 31 October, and so he might ignore the cabinet manual. Bone argued that, because parliament voted to trigger article 50, leaving on 31 October was already the default, and that that is what a government in caretaker mode should implement.</p> <p>As for whether the EU could unilaterally keep the UK in, the answer is no.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-16T15:51:06.715Z\">at 4.51pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d2dceda8f08d0b6ca531a4e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-16T15:34:06.751Z\">4.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is a question from below the line which is pertinent.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/131082458\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/101462185\" title=\"View Katherine1984\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/101462185\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Katherine1984\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/101462185\" title=\"View Katherine1984\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Katherine1984</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/131082458\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">16 July 2019 10:44am</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Andrew \u2013 Most agree that a No Confidence vote on a Tory government set on a No Deal Brexit is inevitable.</p> <p>So it will come down to how many anti-Brexit Tory rebels are prepared to vote against the government to how many Labour MPs who are pro-Brexit, either because of their own convictions or because they are representing a Leave-voting constituency, will vote to support the government to get Brexit through on 31st October.</p> <p>Do we have a good guide to how many of each group there are?</p> <p>Thank you.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <p>It is not quite as simple as that, because <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/mps/current-state-of-the-parties/\">there are now 20 independent MPs in the Commons</a> - 15 independents, and five Independents Group for Change ones - and it is not obvious how they would all vote. Most would vote against the government on a confidence motion, but probably not all of them, and I have not seen an up-to-date count. If there were an early election, almost all of them would probably lose their seats.</p> <p>Trying to work out how many Tory MPs would, in practice, resign the whip and vote against their own government to stop a no-deal Brexit is not easy. Dominic Grieve and Ken Clarke say they would. Others who said they would, like Anna Soubry, have already left. There are a lot more who are saying they would vote to stop no-deal, but who won\u2019t at this stage commit to voting to bring down a government committed to no-deal. A few of these might be willing to sacrifice their careers in Tory politics to stop no-deal, but perhaps only a handful more than those who have already declared.</p> <p>I was surprised to hear the Labour MP Sarah Champion suggest she might not vote with her own party on a no confidence motion. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/16/tory-leadership-latest-news-johnson-will-bring-down-government-if-he-goes-for-no-deal-brexit-says-top-tory-live-news?page=with:block-5d2db7008f08cf92bb770d18#block-5d2db7008f08cf92bb770d18\"> 12.39pm.)</a> Any Labour MP who rebelled like this would not be allowed to stand for the party at a general election, and so it does not seem a sensible move for anyone keen to keep their seat. Perhaps one or two of the Labour Brexiters planning to retire anyway might be willing to abstain to help Brexit over the line, but, with the possible exception of Kate Hoey, they all hate the Tories and Boris Johnson even more than they like Brexit, so I would not put money on that either.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d2de76e8f08d0b6ca531ba8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-16T15:12:46.119Z\">4.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">How Theresa May was warned her three Brexit priorities for Ireland were incompatible</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is what <strong>Sir Ivan Rogers</strong>, the former ambassador to Brussels, said in the hearing about how Theresa May was making incompatible promises on Ireland.

This is a significant development that means the next Tory leader will go into talks with the EU tied to a position more extreme than what was being advocated by hardish Brexiters only about six months ago (eg Dominic Raab, who would have stayed in cabinet if the backstop had been time-limited). <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2019-07-15/boris-johnson-and-jeremy-hunt-make-no-deal-brexit-probable-robert-peston/\">In a blog responding to the debate</a>, ITV\u2019s political editor <strong>Robert Peston</strong> said EU leaders would see this as the moment when \u201cthe Tory party became the no-deal party\u201d.</p> <p>This morning<strong> Dominic Grieve,</strong> the Conservative former attorney general and one of the MPs doing most to find a way of allowing parliament to block no-deal, said the next Tory leader (almost certainly Johnson) would bring down his government if he tried to push for no-deal.

      "bodyText": "Sir Ivan Rogers, the former British ambassador to the EU, has told MPs that he advised Theresa May in 2016 that her three Brexit priorities for Northern Ireland were incompatible. (See 3.39pm and 4.12pm.) In separate evidence to the foreign affairs committee, on leaks, he said he would never put anything interesting in a diplomatic telegram, a communication widely circulated at Westminster. The age limit for playing National Lottery scratchcards and online instant win games could be increased to 18, the government has said. Culture minister Mims Davies said she was launching a consultation on whether the existing age limit of 16 for all National Lottery games should be raised for some or all games and products. The number of first-time applications for Irish passports from Great Britain has risen sharply since the EU referendum with five times as many people interesting in acquiring one. The House of Lords has been adjourned after a peer was taken ill. Doorkeepers went to the aid of Labour former Foreign Office minister Lord Judd as other peers looked anxiously on, the Press Association reports. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Tom Watson and four members of Labour\u2019s governing body have backed a new motion which would auto-exclude members accused of racism or other forms of discrimination, overseen by an independent appointee, in a radical overhaul of the party\u2019s complaints process. The proposed change, in the wake of the BBC Panorama documentary where eight whistleblowers alleged interference from the senior Labour officials in antisemitism complaints, will be debated at next week\u2019s full meeting of the national executive committee. The motion, signed by Watson, MP George Howarth, councillor Alice Perry and Nick Forbes and the societies representative James Asser, calls on the NEC to resolve to bring forward rule changes to annual conference to: establish an independent complaints process to deal with allegations of racism, sexism, misogyny, homophobia or transphobia. automatically exclude a member from the party where there is irrefutable evidence of racism, sexism, misogyny, homophobia or transphobia. It is unclear whether the NEC, which has a pro-Jeremy Corbyn majority, would pass such a new rule. Currently complaints are subject to a quasi-judicial process which can take years to resolve complaints and members can only be expelled after a hearing by the party\u2019s highest disciplinary body, the National Constitutional Committee, which has elected members from the party. High-profile cases including the former mayor of London Ken Livingstone took more than two years to resolve. And here is another interesting question from below the line. In your question you talk about parliament legislating against no deal. Unless it passes a law requiring the PM to revoke article 50, it cannot absolutely legislate to stop no deal. One possible option might be to legislate to require the PM to either win a vote approving a no-deal Brexit or to request an article 50 extension. If that law had been passed by the time of an election, it would stand. But the EU has to agree an article 50 extension, and so the UK cannot determine that unilaterally. On the main point, whether an election campaign ending after 31 October would oblige the new PM to request an article 50 extension, effectively halting Brexit to allow the electorate to express its views, opinion varies. At the Brexit committee last week David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister and Theresa May\u2019s de facto deputy, implied that the proper thing to do would be to delay. He explained: Certainly, the convention that has been established hitherto and is reflected in the cabinet manual is that if a general election is called, whether triggered by the Fixed-term Parliaments Act or because parliament gets to the end of its term, the government from that moment goes on to a caretaker basis and does not take any significant decisions that would prejudice the freedom of decision taking by whichever government the people elect. But at the hearing the Tory Brexiter Peter Bone strongly objected to Lidington\u2019s interpretation. If Boris Johnson were PM, he could argue that he was elected leader with a mandate to leave the EU by 31 October, and so he might ignore the cabinet manual. Bone argued that, because parliament voted to trigger article 50, leaving on 31 October was already the default, and that that is what a government in caretaker mode should implement. As for whether the EU could unilaterally keep the UK in, the answer is no. Here is a question from below the line which is pertinent. It is not quite as simple as that, because there are now 20 independent MPs in the Commons - 15 independents, and five Independents Group for Change ones - and it is not obvious how they would all vote. Most would vote against the government on a confidence motion, but probably not all of them, and I have not seen an up-to-date count. If there were an early election, almost all of them would probably lose their seats. Trying to work out how many Tory MPs would, in practice, resign the whip and vote against their own government to stop a no-deal Brexit is not easy. Dominic Grieve and Ken Clarke say they would. Others who said they would, like Anna Soubry, have already left. There are a lot more who are saying they would vote to stop no-deal, but who won\u2019t at this stage commit to voting to bring down a government committed to no-deal. A few of these might be willing to sacrifice their careers in Tory politics to stop no-deal, but perhaps only a handful more than those who have already declared. I was surprised to hear the Labour MP Sarah Champion suggest she might not vote with her own party on a no confidence motion. (See 12.39pm.) Any Labour MP who rebelled like this would not be allowed to stand for the party at a general election, and so it does not seem a sensible move for anyone keen to keep their seat. Perhaps one or two of the Labour Brexiters planning to retire anyway might be willing to abstain to help Brexit over the line, but, with the possible exception of Kate Hoey, they all hate the Tories and Boris Johnson even more than they like Brexit, so I would not put money on that either. This is what Sir Ivan Rogers, the former ambassador to Brussels, said in the hearing about how Theresa May was making incompatible promises on Ireland. (See 3.39pm.) Speaking about his time in Brussels, before he resigned in January 2017, he said: You could see, if you were me, the Irish question was being underplayed. We were not focusing enough on it. It was obviously going to be the core of the problem ... One of the most unpopular things I think I said to the prime minister in the autumn of 2016 is \u2018You\u2019ve made three commitments in good faith to different audiences, but they are not really compatible with each other. You have said to the Irish under no circumstances will a hard border be erected across the island of Ireland. You\u2019ve said to the Democratic Unionist community under no circumstances will there be divergence from the rest of Great Britain. And you\u2019ve said to the right of your own party that you\u2019re heading out of the customs union. Well, you can\u2019t do all three. You\u2019ve got to choose two of the three.\u2019 And I had the same conversation with then foreign secretary [Boris Johnson]. Ivan Rogers has now finished giving evidence to the foreign affairs committee about Brexit. He and two other former ambassadors are now giving evidence about the leaking of classified information. I will be keeping an eye on this hearing, but I won\u2019t be covering it in detail. You can watch a live feed here. This is John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, commenting on the fall in the value of the pound today. (See 12.28pm.) The instability and uncertainty caused by the Conservative party leadership contest has real world consequences. The commitment of both contenders to a no-deal Brexit makes it even more important the government put an end to playing games with people\u2019s livelihoods and call a general election now. Back in the foreign affairs committee Ivan Rogers says that, structurally, the way the Brexit department was operating was \u201cbound to be a mess\u201d because Olly Robbins, when he was its permanent secretary, was reporting both to the Brexit secretary, David Davis, who had a particular stance on Brexit, and to the prime minister, in his capacity as her adviser. That caused a tension because the Davis\u2019s priorities and the PM\u2019s were not always the same, he says. And this is from Sky\u2019s Stephen Murphy. @Paschald is Paschal Donohoe, the Irish finance minister. Turning away from the foreign affairs committee hearing for a moment, Sky\u2019s Sam Coates is reporting that Boris Johnson could send MPs home for up to two weeks in October under plans being considered by his campaign. Rogers says before he left the civil service he thought the Irish issue was being underplayed. He says he recalls telling Theresa May that she had made three commitments on Northern Ireland that were not compatible. She had told the Irish that there would be no hard border, she had told the DUP that there would be no divergence between Britain and Northern Ireland, and she had told the right of her party that that UK would leave the customs union. He says he told her that she could only have two of those three. He says the same to the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, he says. Ivan Rogers says he told May her three Brexit priorities for Northern Ireland were incompatible with each other. Rogers is describing what John Springford from the Centre for European Reform called May\u2019s Irish trilemma. https://www.cer.eu/insights/theresa-mays-irish-trilemma Rogers says Theresa May had huge experience of justice and home affairs when she became PM. But she did not have experience of the economic side of the EU. In justice and home affairs the UK had a lot of opt-outs. But in relation to the single market, opt-outs weren\u2019t available, he says. He says the UK had to choose between a range of options. He says this was not a popular message to give to the PM. Rogers says, if Theresa May has played hardball in the final three months of 2016, he does not know if the EU would have agreed to open negotiations before the UK triggered article 50. But when the UK did trigger article 50 at the end of March 2017, the EU was celebrating, he says. Q: Do you think you should have seen the PM\u2019s red lines speech in advance? Rogers says he was \u201csurprised\u201d not to have read it. He says he was ever more surprised that Sir Jeremy Heywood, the cabinet secretary, had not read it. He says the speech took EU leaders by surprise. He says he spoke to Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, and Donald Tusk, the European council president, afterwards. He says Juncker told him three times. Juncker said it led to only one conclusion. Q: Which was? That the UK was going much further out of the EU than Juncker had expected, says Rogers. He says perhaps EU leaders should not have been surprised. At that point some EU leaders assumed a new PM would try to keep the UK in the EU. Rogers says he told them that would not be happening. Rogers says he was told by Olly Robbins, the PM\u2019s Brexit adviser, that Theresa May was going to announce a date for triggering article 50 in her speech to the Conservative party conference in the autumn of 2016. Rogers says he said it would be a bad idea, but he recognised that it was probably too late to influence the process. He says his argument was that, by announcing a date, the UK would lose negotiating leverage. Olly rang me up to say, \u2018She\u2019s going to announce the date set for triggering article 50 tomorrow. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a very good idea. What do you think?\u2019 I said no I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a very good idea because you lose a lot of leverage the moment you do that. But presumably if they are telling you that they are going to announce it, we\u2019re fighting a losing battle but I think it\u2019s worth fighting just to at least register that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very wise because that\u2019s exactly what the opposition wants you to do. Rogers says he was not shown in advance the May speech setting red lines for Brexit. It was a party conference speech. He would not expect to see it in advance, he says. Tugendhat asks about a memo from Rogers that was leaked in 2016 saying trade talks with the EU could take up to 10 years and still fail. Rogers says he wrote these memos to try to explain what would happen. He says they were long intentionally. He says David Cameron told him that he read Rogers\u2019 memos on the plane as he was on his way to EU meetings. Tom Tugendhat, the Tory chair of the committee, is asking the question. Q: Did the Foreign Office set guidelines for what the future relationship with the EU should be? Rogers says by this time he had left the civil service. But he does not think the Foreign Office was centrally involved. Turning away from the foreign affairs committee hearing for a moment, the Times\u2019 Henry Zeffman has posted Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s reply to the letter he received from Labour peers yesterday. Rogers says he recalls telling Sir Jeremy Heywood, the then cabinet secretary, that if the UK voted to leave the EU, Brexit would dominate Whitehall for a decade. Two successive parliaments would be dominated by the need to pass Brexit legislation, Rogers says he recalls saying. Rogers says the UK has been \u201cdemonstrably on a different track\u201d from the rest of the EU for much of its membership. Rogers says when he left the civil service in 2006 to work in the private sector he told people the issue for the future was not whether or not the UK would join the euro, but whether or not it would leave the EU. The Brexit crisis has been coming for a very long time, he says. Rogers says he warned about the possibility of Brexit some time before the 2016 referendum. After the 2015 civil servants considered the case for Brexit planning, he said. They might have looked at the models of Brexit available to ministers. But ministers did not want the work done, he says. And he says it was not for the cabinet secretary to go ahead and order that work if ministers were not in favour. He says the leave campaign avoided having a plan in the campaign, because having a plan would have made it harder to keep the leave coalition together. But Rogers says he had read all the plans for Brexit that were around. He says he probably knew more about the options than anyone else. Q: Did any civil servants object to the lack of planning? Rogers says he does not think there is a record of any objections. But he says he recalls Nick Clegg, in the coalition government, objecting to the idea of the work being done. Rogers says he thinks Clegg would have objected to anything that might have made Brexit look more credible. Sir Ivan Rogers, the former British ambassador to the EU, is giving evidence to the Commons foreign affairs committee about relations with the EU. Rogers has been one of the most outspoken and perceptive critics of the government\u2019s Brexit policy since he resigned in January 2017. Jeremy Corbyn has criticised Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt for refusing to accept that President Trump\u2019s tweets about how four non-white congresswomen should go back their own countries was racist. (See 9.45am.) Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt\u2019s Brexit plan to axe the Irish border backstop from the withdrawal agreement will be rejected outright by the European Union, EU sources have said. Former cabinet ministers could be among those who feel they have no choice but to vote down a Boris Johnson administration in order to prevent a no-deal Brexit, Dominic Grieve has said. Michael Gove, the environment secretary, has praised Boris Johnson as a \u201cpassionately green Tory\u201d. Speaking in Kew Gardens, where he was giving a speech, he gave a warm endorsement to the runaway favourite in the Tory leadership contest who three years ago he declared unfit to be prime minister. Gove, who has not said whether he will be voting for Johnson or Jeremy Hunt, said: I know Boris has been passionate about the environment for decades. When I first met Boris Johnson he described himself to me without prompting as a passionately green Tory and in every role he has had he has championed the environment. As foreign secretary he\u2019s been a powerful and persuasive voice on safeguarding wildlife from exploitation, further protecting our oceans and fighting climate change. I know they both would be great prime ministers and I want to affirm today that we can trust them both to do the right thing on every critical issue facing us and of course most critically on the environment. Gove also said he expected the next PM to include an environment bill in the next Queen\u2019s Speech. He said: Later this year we plan to integrate and elevate our new environmental ambitions into law. It will be the new prime minister who will have the ultimate decision on the content of the environment bill. But the party has collectively agreed it will be the flagship measure of the next Queen\u2019s speech. I\u2019m greatly encouraged that both candidates to be our next prime minister have made clear they will not dilute our environmental ambitions, indeed they would seek to raise them. The lobbying firm co-run by the man heading Boris Johnson\u2019s leadership campaign has been writing to councils on behalf of a tobacco company before the announcement of planned new anti-smoking measures due in the coming weeks. Scotland\u2019s drug-related death toll has increased by 27% over the past year to reach a record high of 1,187, putting the country on a par in terms of the fatality rate per capita with the United States, where synthetic opioids such as fentanyl have devastated drug-using populations. Ursula von der Leyen has championed gender equality in her appeal to MEPs to back her as the first female president of the European commission, telling the European parliament: \u201cWe represent half of our population. We want our fair share.\u201d The rightwing philosopher Sir Roger Scruton has received an apology from the government minister who sacked him over comments in a magazine interview. As the Press Association reports, Scruton was dismissed from his role as a housing adviser in April but James Brokenshire, the housing secretary, has said he regretted the way the decision was made. Brokenshire is also expected to meet Scruton in the coming days to see what role he would be prepared to play on the building design agenda in future. In a letter published in the Spectator, Brokenshire apologised for sacking Scruton from his role in the Building Better, Building Beautiful Commission. As you know, I regret that the decision to remove you from your leadership role within the commission was taken in the way that it was. I am sorry - especially as it was based on a clearly partial report of your thoughts ... If you would be willing, I would like to invite you to meet to discuss [the commission\u2019s] and what part you might be prepared to play in advancing this important agenda which we both care about so much. A Number 10 spokeswoman said: \u201cThe communities secretary has expressed regret over the circumstances of [Scruton\u2019s] dismissal. I believe that they are meeting in the coming days to have a discussion.\u201d Oversight of Britain\u2019s railways should be in the hands of one individual or body which is independent of government, according to the head of a major review. As the Press Association reports, former British Airways chief executive Keith Williams, who is leading the government-commissioned Rail Review, said the appointment of a \u201cFat Controller\u201d type figure would be \u201ckey for regaining public trust\u201d. Williams told the BBC the influence of the Department for Transport (DfT) should be restricted to budgets and overall policy rather than day-to-day operations. He added: \u201cSomeone needs to be accountable to the public.\u201d This suggests the possible return of a body similar to the Strategic Rail Authority, which existed from 2001 to 2005 and was tasked with raising standards through the awarding of franchises. There is a real end-of-term feeling in the Commons at the moment. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, gave Philip Hammond, the chancellor, what was effectively a leaving present in Treasury questions recently - a book of radical walks. Today Greg Clark, the business secretary, gave a model car to his Labour counterpart, Rebecca Long-Bailey. Clark handed over the gift after speaking about changes to the UK automotive industry and new electric vehicle projects. Hammond and Clark are both expected to be sacked next week, largely because they are both firmly opposed to a no-deal Brexit. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, the two candidates left in the Tory leadership contest, insist no-deal must remain an option, and their comments about the backstop last night have made it even more probable. The Labour MP Sarah Champion has told the BBC\u2019s Politics Live (not to be confused with the original) that if necessary she would accept no-deal and that she cannot be sure how she would vote on a no confidence motion, the BBC\u2019s Andrew Alexander reports. UPDATE: Here are the clips. This is from my colleague Rowena Mason, who is covering Michael Gove\u2019s speech this morning. And these are from the Sun\u2019s Matt Dathan. From Bloomberg The pound has just hit its lowest level against the US dollar in over two years, after Boris Johnson raised fears of a no-deal Brexit with his comments about the Northern Ireland backstop last night (see 9.19am), my colleague Graeme Wearden reports. He has more on his business live blog. The People\u2019s Vote campaign has put out research showing that, if the pound were to fall to parity with the dollar in the event of a no-deal Brexit (a standard assumption, although of course no one can predict for certain what would happen), the cost of an average British holiday would rise by \u00a3225. These are from Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall. Simon Hoare, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons Northern Ireland affairs committee, has described the decision by both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt to rule out a Brexit deal involving the backstop as \u201ca very, very dangerous step\u201d, PoliticsHome reports. Hoare told Sky News that he hoped whoever won the leadership contest would reconsider once it was over. He said allowing a hard border to return in Ireland was \u201cbeyond contemplation\u201d. This is from the Tory Brexiter Steve Baker, who has expressed his opposition to President Trump\u2019s go back home tweets by celebrating a pro-immigration speech given by Ronald Reagan. If you have a few minutes, the speech is well worth watching. It\u2019s compelling. How will the Brexit crisis get resolved? The People\u2019s Vote campaign has published a report (pdf) this morning looking at six possible outcomes, all of which it describes as dead ends. The other two it lists are a no-deal Brexit, which it describes as the cliff edge, and a second referendum, which is presents as the solution. Speaking at the launch Dominic Grieve, the Conservative former attorney general, said that Boris Johnson\u2019s decision last night to rule out any deal including a Northern Ireland backstop meant the Brexit options were being radicalised. Grieve explained: When challenged and confronted [Johnson] radicalised even further and excluded any possibility of trying to negotiate some way out of the backstop at all. It had to go in its totality. The consequence of that is make it the choices starker and starker. It makes them starker for me as well, let\u2019s be absolutely clear about this. I\u2019ve always been willing as a politician to listen to people willing to come up with credible compromises but what I\u2019ve found so staggering about the Conservative leadership [contest] is it has been played to a tune of growing extremism. In a statement issued in the People\u2019s Vote\u2019s press notice, Grieve also said that an electoral alliance with the Brexit party would mark \u201cthe end of the Conservative party as we know it\u201d. He said: Some talk about an alliance in such an election with Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party as if it could deliver a landslide but, even if that was the case, it would not be for a party that Churchill, Macmillan, Thatcher or Major would recognise. It would be a victory for a virulent form of populism that is a threat to our most cherished values and our democracy. It would be the end of the Conservative party as we know it. The far-right group Britain First has been fined \u00a344,200 by the Electoral Commission for failing to comply with financial rules. As the Press Association reports, Britain First was fined by the watchdog for multiple offences committed while it was a registered political party in the period up to November 2017. Although it has since de-registered, Britain First remains responsible for its actions during that period, the commission said. David Henig, the trade specialist and former civil servant who now runs the UK Trade Policy Project, has posted a good thread on Twitter about the Brexit stance of Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt. It starts here. Tonight MEPs will vote on whether or not to approve Ursula von der Leyen as the new president of the European commission. In her speech at the start of the debate, Von der Leyen restated her willingness to agree to another article 50 extension provided the UK supplies \u201ca good reason\u201d. She said: We cannot talk about Europe without talking about our friends from the UK. For the very first time, in 2016 a member state decided to leave the EU. This is a serious decision, we regret it but we respect it. Since then, together with the current government of the UK, the EU has worked hard to organise the orderly departure of the UK. Von der Leyen said the withdrawal agreement \u201cprovides certainty where Brexit created uncertainty\u201d. She went on: However, I stand ready for a further extension of the withdrawal date should more time be required for a good reason. Speaking in the debate, the Brexit party leader and MEP Nigel Farage said the European parliament had been \u201chumbled and humiliated\u201d by the process which led to Von der Leyen being nominated by the European council instead of the candidates backed by the political groups in the parliament. Claiming that she was a \u201cfanatic for building a European army\u201d, he went on: In some ways I\u2019m really rather pleased, because you have just made Brexit a lot more popular in the UK, thank God we are leaving. Von der Leyen hit back saying it was important to continue to work with the British \u201cbut I think, Mr Farage, we can probably do without what you have got to say here\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn is \u201cnot cut out\u201d to be Labour leader, the Labour peer Toby Harris told the Today programme this morning. Harris, who chairs the Labour peers group, was speaking about the offer by Labour peers to help Corbyn address the antisemitism problem facing the party. Corbyn himself had \u201chuge responsibility\u201d for this, Harris said. He explained: There\u2019s no question that in any organisation the moral tone that it sets, the style that it operates in is set from the top \u2013 that\u2019s what leadership is all about. So obviously Jeremy Corbyn has got a huge responsibility in this. He could have reined back some of his more idiotic supporters and stopped them doing some of the things they are doing \u2013 the intimidation of members, the extraordinary discriminatory remark; he could have reined back the people in his office who have been apparently interfering in cases of discipline within the party. The concern that I have \u2013 and I have known Jeremy Corbyn for 47 years \u2013 is that he is not cut out to be a party leader. He is a brilliant campaigner and yet I suspect the details, the managerial responsibilities, the day-to-day management of the way in which the party operates are not necessarily his skills. Jeremy Corbyn has criticised the two Tory leadership candidates, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, for their refusal to describe President Trump\u2019s go back home tweets to four congresswomen as racist in the Sun/talkRadio debate last night. Here is our story about what Johnson and Hunt did say about Trump. Unemployment fell by 51,000 to 1.29m in the three months to May, the Office for National Statistics has said. And average earnings increased by 3.4% compared with 3.2% in the previous month. At the Sun/talkRadio Tory leadership debate last night, both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt declared that the Northern Ireland backstop was \u201cdead\u201d and that, even if the EU were to agree to put a time limit on how long it would last, it would still be unacceptable. This is a significant development that means the next Tory leader will go into talks with the EU tied to a position more extreme than what was being advocated by hardish Brexiters only about six months ago (eg Dominic Raab, who would have stayed in cabinet if the backstop had been time-limited). In a blog responding to the debate, ITV\u2019s political editor Robert Peston said EU leaders would see this as the moment when \u201cthe Tory party became the no-deal party\u201d. This morning Dominic Grieve, the Conservative former attorney general and one of the MPs doing most to find a way of allowing parliament to block no-deal, said the next Tory leader (almost certainly Johnson) would bring down his government if he tried to push for no-deal. Speaking on the Today programme, he also said the policy shift announced last night was \u201csignificant\u201d. Here are the main points. Grieve warned that Johnson would bring down his own government if he tried to implement a no-deal Brexit. He said: As I\u2019ve said on many occasions in the house over the last 12 months, if a government persists in trying to carry out a no-deal Brexit, I think that administration is going to fall. Grieve said the appointment of a new cabinet, with ministers opposed to no-deal almost certainly being demoted to the back benches, would increase the number of Tory MPs willing to vote against no-deal. This could \u201cmake a difference\u201d to voting numbers in the Commons, he said. I think that by the end of next week there are going to be more Conservatives who have indicated very clearly that no-deal is unacceptable and many of them will no longer be on the front bench. There were many MPs who thought a no-deal Brexit would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for Britain, he said. He said that blocking a no-deal Brexit \u201ctechnically ... may be quite difficult\u201d for the Commons. That was why an attempt to go for no-deal could lead to a no confidence motion instead, he argued. He said MPs were increasingly realising that a second referendum might be the best solution. Grieve himself backs a second referendum. He told the programme: Quite a lot of my colleagues know at the end of the day that it\u2019s going to be a choice between a referendum or a general election, and a general election moreover which may well not deliver any conclusive outcome and help us out of the crisis. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: The Conservative MP Dominic Grieve and Labour MP Margaret Beckett speak at the launch of a People\u2019s Vote report looking at possible Brexit outcomes. 9.30am: Theresa May chairs her penultimate cabinet. 9.30am: Unemployment figures are published. 10am: Peter Clarke, the chief inspector of prisons, and Robert Buckland, the justice minister, give evidence to the Commons justice committee. 11.30am: Michael Gove, the environment secretary, gives a speech on global warming. 2.45am: Sir Ivan Rogers, the former ambassador to the EU, gives evidence to the Commons foreign affairs committee about Brexit and about the leaking of classified information. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary at lunchtime and then another when I finish at about 5pm. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "An art tradition sometimes dismissed as perpetuating lazy stereotypes about the east will soon \u2013 the British Museum hopes \u2013 be seen in a different light thanks to a major exhibition exploring how western artists have been inspired by the Islamic world. The museum has announced details of a show that will have the tradition of Orientalism at its core. That term for many people is highly charged, bringing to mind patronising 19th-century oil paintings by colonialist artists depicting a version of life in the Middle East that often did not exist. But for Olivia Threlkeld, co-curator of the exhibition: \u201cOrientalism was one of the defining elements of the 19th and 20th centuries, comparable to other \u2019isms like surrealism and impressionism.\u201d The exhibition is being held in collaboration with the Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur which is lending about half the exhibits in the show, many being shown outside Malaysia for the first time. The exhibition will acknowledge that some 19th-century Orientalist works blurred the lines between fantasy and reality by showing a stereotyped view of the east, whether that was barbaric behaviour or a scene of people sitting around drinking coffee with no cares or work to do. But there is a much longer and richer history to be explored, say curators. The show will trace the origins of Orientalism to the 1500s and features 16th-century western paintings of Ottoman sultans.

Since memory is so bound up in learning \u2013 spatial memory; what sits where on the page, even \u2013 it doesn\u2019t seem too far-fetched to imagine that learning itself will be harder when physical textbooks are left behind. I fancy even plagiarism from a physical textbook \u2013 with the need at least to photocopy or transcribe \u2013 involves a degree of effort that helps the plagiarist to learn something. Physical annotations in old textbooks are a time-travelling device, an aide-memoire, or the filaments that bind a community of learning across the generations (look: whoever defaced this book drew dashes instead of teardrops for the spunk!). If and only if Pearson promises to make annotation and vandalism as easy and as satisfying and as durable as they were in print \u2013 and to beam the smell of new textbooks and the wrinkles of the old ones to users through the cloud \u2013 will \u201cdigital first\u201d be worth welcoming. \u2022 Sam Leith is literary editor of the Spectator",

McIlroy regards it as his first \u201cout-of-body\u201d golfing experience, aged just 16. He insisted at the time this was his first ever bogey-free competitive round. Less striking is the admission that in 2019 he can still recall every shot. When the now four-times major winner lost in the match-play segment of that competition, 3&amp;1 to Andrew Pitcher, McIlroy wasn\u2019t upset. \u201cI was still on such a high from the 61 that I think I shrugged my shoulders a little bit,\u201d he recalls.</p> \n<p>They were a tight-knit group. Harry Diamond, McIlroy\u2019s current caddie and lifelong best friend, was delighted with level par as the 61 unfolded a few groups behind him. Ricky McCormick, now the club professional at Holywood Golf Club, was McIlroy\u2019s caddie for the week. O\u2019Callaghan says: \u201cAbout an hour after we were done, Rory came up to me laughing: \u2018Aaron, you\u2019re not going to believe this. Ricky has just been talking about your putting.

      "bodyText": "Kieran Trippier is on the verge of sealing a move to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in a deal worth \u00a320m plus add-ons and he has been given permission by Tottenham to travel to the Spanish capital for a medical. The full-back, who starred for England at the World Cup in Russia, endured a difficult season last time out and Mauricio Pochettino, the Spurs manager, has decided to cash in on him as he reshapes his squad for what he has called the \u201cnext chapter\u201d. Atl\u00e9tico want a replacement for Juanfran, who they officially released last month, and tried to take N\u00e9lson Semedo from Barcelona only to be rebuffed. They have monitored Trippier for some weeks, registering their interest with Spurs and they have now made their move. Spurs have excused Trippier from their team flight to Singapore on Wednesday \u2013 where they will step up their pre-season preparations \u2013 and, were the deal to go through, Pochettino would be left with Serge Aurier and Kyle Walker-Peters as options at right-back. He is also confident that Juan Foyth, nominally a centre-half, can play in the position. Spurs remain interested in Fulham\u2019s left-sided player Ryan Sessegnon, together with his twin brother, Steven, a right-back. Tottenham have already broken their transfer record with the \u00a355m capture of the Lyon midfielder Tanguy Ndombele and have also completed the \u00a310m purchase of Jack Clarke, who has been loaned back to Leeds, but any moves for any other targets such as William Saliba of Saint-\u00c9tienne or Real Madrid\u2019s Dani Ceballos are likely to be funded by sales.",

Hopefully their pitches will fail.</p> <h2>I Want a Famous Face, 2004-2005</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2MlTzZIpVk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Q2MlTzZIpVk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In which participants reveal that they\u2019ll only be happy if they look like Jessica Simpson or Pamela Anderson or Elvis Presley. A different, better show would spend time locating the root of this dysmorphia and spend time gradually rebuilding their shattered self-esteem. But not I Want a Famous Face. Instead, I Want a Famous Face shoved them through a round of expensive and painful plastic surgery until they achieved their goal of looking like their hero, or at least a wincing Claymation version of their hero.</p> <h2>The X Effect, 2007-2009</h2> <p>A couple splits up, but they still have complicated feelings for each other. The X Effect takes them for a weekend away to see whether they are able to rekindle their love. And now for the unnecessarily cruel twist: while this is happening, the couple\u2019s actual current partners, who they managed to move on with, are secretly watching them. Perhaps the tawdriest television show of all time, if The X Effect were revived today it\u2019d be called Cucks Ahoy.</p>",

Hopefully their pitches will fail. I Want a Famous Face, 2004-2005 In which participants reveal that they\u2019ll only be happy if they look like Jessica Simpson or Pamela Anderson or Elvis Presley. A different, better show would spend time locating the root of this dysmorphia and spend time gradually rebuilding their shattered self-esteem. But not I Want a Famous Face. Instead, I Want a Famous Face shoved them through a round of expensive and painful plastic surgery until they achieved their goal of looking like their hero, or at least a wincing Claymation version of their hero. The X Effect, 2007-2009 A couple splits up, but they still have complicated feelings for each other. The X Effect takes them for a weekend away to see whether they are able to rekindle their love. And now for the unnecessarily cruel twist: while this is happening, the couple\u2019s actual current partners, who they managed to move on with, are secretly watching them. Perhaps the tawdriest television show of all time, if The X Effect were revived today it\u2019d be called Cucks Ahoy.",

Roisin Conaty. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophie Mutevelian</span> </figcaption> </figure>",
      "body": "<p>Roisin Conaty still remembers her first night of standup. It was 2003 and she was at the King\u2019s Head pub in London\u2019s Crouch End, tipsy and being egged on by a friend. Conaty put her name down for the try-out comedy show, then forgot all about it. When they called to tell her it was her turn, she showed up with nothing prepared. \u201cI thought you made it up on the night,\u201d she says, eyes widening. \u201cI now look back and think, \u2018What\u2019s wrong with you?\u2019\u201d She wasn\u2019t even an avid comedy fan. \u201cI\u2019d seen Richard Pryor and Joan Rivers, the stuff off the telly. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d seen anything live before I did a gig, which is weird.\u201d The way Conaty tells it, she seems to be marvelling at the antics of someone else, not looking back at her own history.</p> <p>But the bug bit that night. \u201cIt was like love at first sight,\u201d she says. \u201cIt felt frightening and it mattered immediately.\u201d </p> <p>Conaty still often feels out of place in the entertainment world. When we meet she is drinking a \u201cfat coke\u201d on a sunny roof terrace in Soho and telling me about the time she went to a media party in LA. Someone introduced her to a really important talent rep \u201cand they did a very effusive introduction which felt like it went on for five sentences.\u201d She told the rep to ignore this overblown intro because she was \u201cmiddling at best \u2013 and the guy said, \u2018Oh, how painfully British of you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Conaty\u2019s sitcom, GameFace, is moving to Channel 4 after a barnstorming first series on E4. It\u2019s the offbeat story of out-of-work actor Marcella (played by Conaty), her flatmates, an ex she can\u2019t shake, a driving instructor she fancies, an unethical life coach, a drug-addicted brother, an unhinged dad, and a mum who feeds the family cat spaghetti bolognese. You might have had hints of Conaty\u2019s brilliance in Ricky Gervais\u2019 After Life or alongside Greg Davies in Man Down, but this show is all hers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f20682b13d5ad5db3c17a3a57c16ec82c3f352c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f20682b13d5ad5db3c17a3a57c16ec82c3f352c0/0_0_3500_1717/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barnstorming ...

GameFace.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luke Varley/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s not her own life on screen, but she does harvest bits when it suits. \u201cIt\u2019s not autobiographical because I felt too guarded. I tried at first, and I was like, I can\u2019t do this. I kept just not writing truthfully.\u201d But her real flatmate, Caroline Ginty, plays her flatmate in the show. And the cat? Also based on real life. \u201cI once came in and he and my mum were sharing a kebab.\u201d RIP, Orlando.</p> <p>So the truth is in there \u2013 and she does drill down into her own anxieties. In the first series, the life coach asks Marcella what she\u2019s afraid of. Cut to her, 70-plus, cowering in a wheelie bin, screaming as the apocalypse explodes around her and it\u2019s announced the world has run out of cheese. Then King Trump turns up in a drive-by. God, I hope she\u2019s wrong about cheese.</p> <p>Conaty is confident, but wary of coming across as a bighead. She talks fast and rarely ends a sentence she starts. Her cogs are in constant motion. I am meeting her on a break from the edit downstairs, where she is very much staying on top of things. \u201cYou\u2019re not locking that without me, are you?\u201d she shouts in mock horror to the producer she spots heading back inside. \u201cThe truth is it\u2019s my creation,\u201d she says, \u201cand I\u2019m in from the beginning, every day and all day.\u201d</p> <p>I fell in love with GameFace\u2019s disarmingly exposed comedy after a scene in which Marcella goes on a date with Jon the driving instructor. Leaning on a fence at a city farm, she points out a pale-furred alpaca \u2013 same bouffy hair as her \u2013 and says: \u201cThat\u2019s me. She shares my essence. Look at her swag.\u201d There\u2019s so much going on in that line, and this ability to pack a sentence comes from Conaty\u2019s time as a standup. But even her entry into that career sounds like a Marcella anecdote: her friend urged her to try it even though she\u2019d always been allergic to performing.</p> <p>Her one memory of acting was in Enda Walsh\u2019s Disco Pigs and Sucking Dublin when she was at college. She played a pram-pushing teenager with a \u201cterrible Dublin accent\u201d. When the character had to cry, Conaty smuggled an onion in her pocket, thinking it would impress everyone. Instead, she temporarily blinded herself. \u201cI was like, \u2018Where\u2019s the fucking pram?\u2019\u201d </p> <p>After becoming a standup, it took a seven-year slog on the circuit and a post-Vegas epiphany to create her first solo show. She\u2019d spent her 30th birthday in Las Vegas with better-off friends, hating every second and feeling like a failure among the \u201cmassive shopping centres\u201d and temples to material success.</p> <p>When she got home, her mum gave her some real talk. \u201cShe\u2019s very good at speeches and was like, \u2018If you want to take the island, you\u2019ve got to burn the ships\u2019\u201d. Conaty talks often about their \u201cridiculously close\u201d relationship. \u201cAnd so I left my job \u2013 I was earning like \u00a3150 a month \u2013 and I did move home at this point.\u201d Within months, she was at the Edinburgh fringe, selling out every night and winning the Fosters best newcomer award. The panel shows and TV success soon followed.</p> <p>\u201cEven though I won newcomer, I was still seven grand in debt,\u201d she says. \u201cI grew up on a council estate in Camden and my mum and dad split up when I was about seven.\u201d The lack of money and instability of a childhood spent between parents who kept splitting and reuniting doesn\u2019t make her the obvious candidate for this kind of artistic experimentation. That\u2019s usually the preserve of someone with a bit of privilege and cash behind them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b7cfba1443465bcaad170feaeca188c8c5dbd411\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7cfba1443465bcaad170feaeca188c8c5dbd411/0_129_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Like Larry David \u2013 if he was romantic\u2019 ...

GameFace.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophie Mutevelian/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At last night\u2019s screening of the new series, Conaty sat low in her seat on the front row. \u201cIt feels like a wrong thing to get used to,\u201d she says, frowning. \u201cTo be in a room with your face on a big screen.\u201d Her friend, the comic Brett Goldstein, conducted the Q&amp;A afterwards and began by describing her as \u201cLarry David if he was romantic\u201d. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t do compliments,\u201d she grimaced back at him. But today, she tells me, compliments are grand, just not in front of a crowd. She says that knee-jerk humility comes from her Irish mum, who is \u201cvery proud\u201d of her daughter, but is more interested in whether she is eating vegetables than how many people watch her on TV.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the phrases I grew up with was \u2018Self-praise is no praise\u2019. And I\u2019ve always had that in my mind,\u201d she says. Humility was drummed into her and her sister, but she found herself relishing flights of fancy. \u201cI was a very imaginative child and I told a lot of lies. My sister used to call it my Exaggerator Calculator.

      "bodyText": "Roisin Conaty still remembers her first night of standup. It was 2003 and she was at the King\u2019s Head pub in London\u2019s Crouch End, tipsy and being egged on by a friend. Conaty put her name down for the try-out comedy show, then forgot all about it. When they called to tell her it was her turn, she showed up with nothing prepared. \u201cI thought you made it up on the night,\u201d she says, eyes widening. \u201cI now look back and think, \u2018What\u2019s wrong with you?\u2019\u201d She wasn\u2019t even an avid comedy fan. \u201cI\u2019d seen Richard Pryor and Joan Rivers, the stuff off the telly. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d seen anything live before I did a gig, which is weird.\u201d The way Conaty tells it, she seems to be marvelling at the antics of someone else, not looking back at her own history. But the bug bit that night. \u201cIt was like love at first sight,\u201d she says. \u201cIt felt frightening and it mattered immediately.\u201d Conaty still often feels out of place in the entertainment world. When we meet she is drinking a \u201cfat coke\u201d on a sunny roof terrace in Soho and telling me about the time she went to a media party in LA. Someone introduced her to a really important talent rep \u201cand they did a very effusive introduction which felt like it went on for five sentences.\u201d She told the rep to ignore this overblown intro because she was \u201cmiddling at best \u2013 and the guy said, \u2018Oh, how painfully British of you.\u2019\u201d Conaty\u2019s sitcom, GameFace, is moving to Channel 4 after a barnstorming first series on E4. It\u2019s the offbeat story of out-of-work actor Marcella (played by Conaty), her flatmates, an ex she can\u2019t shake, a driving instructor she fancies, an unethical life coach, a drug-addicted brother, an unhinged dad, and a mum who feeds the family cat spaghetti bolognese. You might have had hints of Conaty\u2019s brilliance in Ricky Gervais\u2019 After Life or alongside Greg Davies in Man Down, but this show is all hers. It\u2019s not her own life on screen, but she does harvest bits when it suits. \u201cIt\u2019s not autobiographical because I felt too guarded. I tried at first, and I was like, I can\u2019t do this. I kept just not writing truthfully.\u201d But her real flatmate, Caroline Ginty, plays her flatmate in the show. And the cat? Also based on real life. \u201cI once came in and he and my mum were sharing a kebab.\u201d RIP, Orlando. So the truth is in there \u2013 and she does drill down into her own anxieties. In the first series, the life coach asks Marcella what she\u2019s afraid of. Cut to her, 70-plus, cowering in a wheelie bin, screaming as the apocalypse explodes around her and it\u2019s announced the world has run out of cheese. Then King Trump turns up in a drive-by. God, I hope she\u2019s wrong about cheese. Conaty is confident, but wary of coming across as a bighead. She talks fast and rarely ends a sentence she starts. Her cogs are in constant motion. I am meeting her on a break from the edit downstairs, where she is very much staying on top of things. \u201cYou\u2019re not locking that without me, are you?\u201d she shouts in mock horror to the producer she spots heading back inside. \u201cThe truth is it\u2019s my creation,\u201d she says, \u201cand I\u2019m in from the beginning, every day and all day.\u201d I fell in love with GameFace\u2019s disarmingly exposed comedy after a scene in which Marcella goes on a date with Jon the driving instructor. Leaning on a fence at a city farm, she points out a pale-furred alpaca \u2013 same bouffy hair as her \u2013 and says: \u201cThat\u2019s me. She shares my essence. Look at her swag.\u201d There\u2019s so much going on in that line, and this ability to pack a sentence comes from Conaty\u2019s time as a standup. But even her entry into that career sounds like a Marcella anecdote: her friend urged her to try it even though she\u2019d always been allergic to performing. Her one memory of acting was in Enda Walsh\u2019s Disco Pigs and Sucking Dublin when she was at college. She played a pram-pushing teenager with a \u201cterrible Dublin accent\u201d. When the character had to cry, Conaty smuggled an onion in her pocket, thinking it would impress everyone. Instead, she temporarily blinded herself. \u201cI was like, \u2018Where\u2019s the fucking pram?\u2019\u201d After becoming a standup, it took a seven-year slog on the circuit and a post-Vegas epiphany to create her first solo show. She\u2019d spent her 30th birthday in Las Vegas with better-off friends, hating every second and feeling like a failure among the \u201cmassive shopping centres\u201d and temples to material success. When she got home, her mum gave her some real talk. \u201cShe\u2019s very good at speeches and was like, \u2018If you want to take the island, you\u2019ve got to burn the ships\u2019\u201d. Conaty talks often about their \u201cridiculously close\u201d relationship. \u201cAnd so I left my job \u2013 I was earning like \u00a3150 a month \u2013 and I did move home at this point.\u201d Within months, she was at the Edinburgh fringe, selling out every night and winning the Fosters best newcomer award. The panel shows and TV success soon followed. \u201cEven though I won newcomer, I was still seven grand in debt,\u201d she says. \u201cI grew up on a council estate in Camden and my mum and dad split up when I was about seven.\u201d The lack of money and instability of a childhood spent between parents who kept splitting and reuniting doesn\u2019t make her the obvious candidate for this kind of artistic experimentation. That\u2019s usually the preserve of someone with a bit of privilege and cash behind them. At last night\u2019s screening of the new series, Conaty sat low in her seat on the front row. \u201cIt feels like a wrong thing to get used to,\u201d she says, frowning. \u201cTo be in a room with your face on a big screen.\u201d Her friend, the comic Brett Goldstein, conducted the Q&amp;A afterwards and began by describing her as \u201cLarry David if he was romantic\u201d. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t do compliments,\u201d she grimaced back at him. But today, she tells me, compliments are grand, just not in front of a crowd. She says that knee-jerk humility comes from her Irish mum, who is \u201cvery proud\u201d of her daughter, but is more interested in whether she is eating vegetables than how many people watch her on TV. \u201cOne of the phrases I grew up with was \u2018Self-praise is no praise\u2019. And I\u2019ve always had that in my mind,\u201d she says. Humility was drummed into her and her sister, but she found herself relishing flights of fancy. \u201cI was a very imaginative child and I told a lot of lies. My sister used to call it my Exaggerator Calculator. I liked telling a story and I knew how to polish it up.\u201d She paints a picture of a chatty child, swinging on lampposts and mingling with the rich mix of people on her estate, trying all their foreign food. She used to make up country songs which her mum would indulge: a tiny north London Dolly Parton. I want to meet that kid. Drifting through her mid-30s with food stuck to her face and no idea of where she\u2019s going, Marcella shares similarities with her creator, but has none of Conaty\u2019s drive and focus. The character also favours a smokier eye, which usually ends up smudged down her cheek because she never removes her makeup before bed. \u201cI like a lot of makeup and I like big blonde hair,\u201d says Conaty. \u201cLife\u2019s too short for the natural look. Bang it on.\u201d But she still insists she isn\u2019t just making confessional comedy. \u201cI do feel she\u2019s a completely separate person. I just feel really connected and protective of her. It\u2019s so strange. I worry that it\u2019s dissociative disorder or something.\u201d Conaty isn\u2019t the new Larry David (she\u2019s nowhere near as self-absorbed).

The Old Thirteenth Cheshire Astley Volunteer Rifleman Corps Inn has reopened after closing three years ago. Referred to by locals as the Rifleman for short, it received a Guinness World Record for the public house with the longest name in the UK and a blue plaque from Tameside council in 1995. When Nigel Baxter decided to set up a pub in the town to run with his wife, Sarah Farrer-Baxter, they were offered the use of the 55-letter name by the Rifleman\u2019s previous owners and jumped at the chance. Farrer-Baxter told the Guardian: \u201cIt\u2019s a massive honour to take on the name, so it\u2019s not lost forever.\u201d She said their enthusiasm was dampened a little when they commissioned a new sign for the pub and realised they would be charged by the letter. \u201cThe invoice did come as a bit of a shock.

Farrer-Baxter said: \u201cThe Rifleman is such an important part of this town\u2019s history so everyone was gutted when it closed down.

      "bodyText": "It was promised as a \u201ctiara on the head of our fabulous city\u201d and \u201ca gift to the people of London\u201d that would be entirely paid for by big business and rich benefactors, but Boris Johnson\u2019s plan for a garden bridge across the Thames cost taxpayers \u00a343m even though the scheme was scrapped long before a single flower would ever bloom. The then mayor of London\u2019s desperation to secure funding to meet the spiralling costs of the 366-metre (1,200ft) crossing led him to make a secretive dash to Silicon Valley to beg Apple executives for cash, offering to allow the iPhone maker to \u201ccall it the Apple Bridge and you pay for it, chum\u201d. Freedom of information (FoI) requests also reveal Johnson, who was twice warned over a \u201clack of transparency\u201d in signing sponsorship deals with Barclays, Emirates and Wonga, sought to keep secret an attempt to get one of Britain\u2019s richest families to fund the bridge while London was in crisis following the brutal murder of Lee Rigby. Johnson met Barnaby and Merlin Swire, the chairman and chief executive of the family-owned conglomerate Swire Group, to discuss \u201cpossible opportunities including the garden bridge project\u201d on 23 May 2013 \u2013 the day after the soldier was murdered outside the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich, south-east London. Johnson omitted the meeting with the Swires, the UK\u2019s 27th richest family with an estimated \u00a35bn fortune, from his official diary until May 2016. The publication of his diary, under FoI rules, showed Johnson squeezed in the meeting with Barnaby Swire, a contemporary of his at Eton, between an emergency Cobra meeting and two trips to the scene of the attack. Johnson swung behind the garden bridge project after Joanna Lumley, the Absolutely Fabulous actor and a friend, sent a handwritten note wishing him \u201ca thousand congratulations\u201d on his re-election for a second term as mayor in 2012, and asked him to support her vision for a \u201cgreen pedestrian bridge\u201d that would bring \u201cgreat loveliness\u201d to the Thames. \u201cPlease say yes,\u201d she said in the letter to Johnson, which was released following an FoI request from the Architects\u2019 Journal, which has uncovered much of the saga surrounding the garden bridge procurement process. The letter also revealed Lumley had already discussed her plan with Thomas Heatherwick, who was later named the official designer of the bridge. A series of FoIs revealed Heatherwick was present at Johnson\u2019s fundraising meeting with Apple executives in 2013 \u2013 days before a Transport for London (TfL) competition to select the bridge\u2019s designer, which Heatherwick won. Johnson\u2019s taxpayer-funded \u00a34,106 flight to Silicon Valley in January 2013 to offer Apple naming rights to the bridge was made almost two years before planning permission was granted in December 2014. An inquiry by the Labour MP Margaret Hodge into the bridge project found the tendering process was \u201cnot open, fair or competitive\u201d. She said: \u201cThe only thing that was clear to me from the evidence provided was that building the garden bridge was a top and urgent priority for the then mayor. [And] decisions on the garden bridge were driven by electoral cycles rather than value for money.\u201d City Hall\u2019s budget and performance committee had earlier raised concerns about sponsorship deals the mayor had signed with Barclays bank to fund a cycle-hire scheme, Emirates airline for a cable car, and the payday lender Wonga to sponsor free travel on New Year\u2019s Eve 2010. The 2012 report Whose Brand Is It Anyway? warned of \u201ca lack of transparency about the costs and revenues of sponsored projects and how this compares to the estimates TfL made at the project approval stage \u2026 The lack of openness is also fuelling speculation and resulting in an increase in the concerns about TfL\u2019s ability to get the best deal for its sponsorship opportunities.\u201d Johnson claimed the cost of flights and hotel for his trip to San Francisco on expenses, but did not declare that the trip was to see Apple or to raise funds for the garden bridge. The full details of the Apple fundraising drive were revealed by Sir Edward Lister under questioning from Hodge about the garden bridge procurement. \u201cThe mayor felt there was a fair chance that Apple might actually sponsor the whole bridge \u2026 So we jumped on a plane,\u201d Lister said. \u201cWe were only there for 24 hours and flew back again. We went there, we talked through it all \u2026 It was: \u2018We do this, we call it the Apple Bridge and you pay for it, chum.\u2019 It was a real sales operation to try and sell it.\u201d Lister said the attempt had failed because Apple had wanted to include a store on the bridge. That would not have fitted with Johnson and Lumley\u2019s pledge that the bridge would be a public space. Johnson refused to give evidence to Hodge\u2019s review of the bridge project, telling her: \u201cI am afraid any interview would not be the best use of my time.\u201d But he added: \u201cI remain a fervent believer in the garden bridge.\u201d He was the only person who refused to give evidence to the inquiry.

Within weeks of taking up his new role, the mayor had been forced to fire his director of strategy over an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jun/23/london.race\">offensive remark</a>, and then one of his deputy mayors, Ray Lewis, over alleged financial improprieties (which he denied) and an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jul/06/boris.london\">embellished CV</a>.</p> \n<p>Days before Johnson left for Beijing, Tim Parker, a businessman who had been appointed as first deputy mayor to oversee the running of Transport for London, the Metropolitan police and more, had also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/19/boris.london\">departed</a>.</p> \n<p>Despite an election campaign that, under the direction of Lynton Crosby, had been efficient and focused, many of Johnson\u2019s backers \u2013 and perhaps even he \u2013 had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/may/02/london08.london\">never fully expected</a> to win.

A former Tory insider said: \u201cIt was total, total chaos \u2013 he upset everyone.\u201d</p> \n<p>But under the quietly efficient stewardship of the former Conservative council leaders Sir Simon Milton and later Sir Edward Lister as chiefs of staff, the ship was gradually steadied. The mayor could get on with the job of deciding what he wanted his mayoralty to achieve.</p> \n<p>City Hall is not Downing Street, and the challenge confronting the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/09/bitter-blue-on-blue-as-hunt-and-johnson-clash-on-live-tv\">next prime minister</a> dwarfs anything faced by other recent holders of the post, let alone a London mayor. But there are surely lessons from the eight years Johnson spent in City Hall that could hint at his working style as prime minister \u2013 the first being that, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/26/boris-johnson-hires-mark-fullbrook-as-campaign-chief-lynton-crosby\">having appointed Lister</a> to lead his transition to government, it is clear he wants to avoid repeating the early dysfunction of 2008.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a6ea1232-6643-43e7-b450-c4461d0fb2be\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8oiGkB2-rMI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Some Johnson supporters would like him to replicate his mayoralty as prime minister. Kulveer Ranger, who was his transport policy director, said: \u201cBoris has said himself he wants to govern the country as he governed London.\u201d</p> \n<p>His style, Ranger said, is to build up \u201ca very strong team around him. He doesn\u2019t like confrontations. He likes to have consensus \u2026 [but if there isn\u2019t one] he takes a decision.\u201d The \u201cBoris bubble\u201d, he added, \u201cis a fantastic place to be \u2013 it\u2019s hugely exciting\u201d.</p> \n<p>Guto Harri, recruited spontaneously by Johnson as his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/may/27/guto-harri-press-campaign-against-bbc\">communications director</a> after the former BBC journalist called his old Oxford University friend about something else two days before the May 2008 election, acknowledged the early months \u201clooked chaotic\u201d, but said Johnson took greater control with every departure, \u201cand the more he took charge, the more focused and determined we became, and the more we got done\u201d.</p> \n<p>Among other priorities, Harri said, Johnson focused on cutting what he saw as the wasteful spending of his predecessor, Ken Livingstone, including slashing the size of the party that had originally been due to fly to Beijing, and opting for economy class flights.</p> \n<p>But others who worked for, alongside or actively against him as mayor are less beguiled by the prospect of Johnson as prime minister. Jenny Jones, a deputy mayor under Livingstone who was a London assembly member during Johnson\u2019s tenure, said: \u201cA lot of us like him because he is charming and funny, and good to have a cup of coffee with, but none of us trust him.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd even people who work for him get very edgy when you say things like that because they mostly agree. He is a charming companion, but you couldn\u2019t trust him to feed your cat if you were away one evening.\u201d</p> \n<p>At mayor\u2019s question time, Lady Jones said, Johnson \u201cwould come in straight off his bicycle, drop his helmet, then his bag, and somebody would bring him a cup of coffee. And you always got the feeling he hadn\u2019t read his papers.\u201d</p> \n<p>Not reading his briefs is a repeated criticism by opponents, political allies and even members of Johnson\u2019s mayoral campaign teams, but one former senior colleague insisted he was \u201cincredibly hardworking and diligent \u2026 but it seems sometimes that he doesn\u2019t want people to know he is that person.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac78358f7b975a572ef9b8aec37c20953c19f09f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac78358f7b975a572ef9b8aec37c20953c19f09f/0_205_4113_2468/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Johnson talks to a volunteer cleaning up damage from riots in 2011 in Battersea, south-west London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Johnson talks to a volunteer cleaning up damage from riots in 2011 in Battersea, south-west London.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Dunham/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Caroline Pidgeon, a Liberal Democrat London assembly member, said: \u201cIn his first term, he used to constantly quote Latin at us. \u2018I\u2019m intellectually superior\u2019 \u2013 I think that\u2019s his general approach. I\u2019m above everything so I can do what I like.\u201d</p> \n<p>In 2012, Jennette Arnold, the chair of the London assembly, wrote to Johnson on behalf of female assembly members who felt the mayor \u201ctreated them in a disrespectful, patronising way at meetings and in a manner that you do not display when dealing with male AMs\u201d.</p> \n<p>Among the examples listed were Johnson repeatedly calling female colleagues \u201cdear\u201d, accusing one of \u201cchuntering on\u201d and describing the question of another as \u201cblah blah blah blah fishcakes\u201d. Johnson denied sexism.</p> \n<p>But it was not only political opponents who were riled. Boff said: \u201cHe hates being held to account \u2013 we [the Conservative group] weren\u2019t sycophants to Boris, and he hated that. He looked thoroughly hurt whenever we would challenge him, as if he had been stabbed in the back.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson had been mayor of London for 115 days when the rest of the world got its first glimpse of the idiosyncratic charms that had helped him bag the job. After shambling, his blazer unbuttoned, into the Bird\u2019s Nest stadium in Beijing for the handover ceremony of the 2008 Olympics, he inexpertly flapped the official flag of the Games for a few seconds, half-heartedly punched the air and then put his hands in his pockets. Later that evening, \u201cLondon\u2019s new and unusual mayor\u201d (New York Times) would declare to a gathering of tipsy Britons and utterly baffled Chinese that \u201cwiff-waff [was] coming home\u201d, concluding a display that led the paper, in a roundup of unofficial medallists, to award him \u201cleast reassuring performance in a transitional role\u201d. The subtext of this and much of the other international coverage was clear: this was the man Londoners had chosen to run their city? Back home, plenty were asking the same question. Within weeks of taking up his new role, the mayor had been forced to fire his director of strategy over an offensive remark, and then one of his deputy mayors, Ray Lewis, over alleged financial improprieties (which he denied) and an embellished CV. Days before Johnson left for Beijing, Tim Parker, a businessman who had been appointed as first deputy mayor to oversee the running of Transport for London, the Metropolitan police and more, had also departed. Despite an election campaign that, under the direction of Lynton Crosby, had been efficient and focused, many of Johnson\u2019s backers \u2013 and perhaps even he \u2013 had never fully expected to win. His fledgling administration, made up of hurried appointments and a back-of-the-envelope management structure, had to scramble to get up to speed. Andrew Boff, a Conservative London assembly member, said: \u201cThe first year was dreadful. We had some terrible problems.\u201d A third deputy mayor, Ian Clement, resigned the following year and was later convicted over expenses irregularities. A former Tory insider said: \u201cIt was total, total chaos \u2013 he upset everyone.\u201d But under the quietly efficient stewardship of the former Conservative council leaders Sir Simon Milton and later Sir Edward Lister as chiefs of staff, the ship was gradually steadied. The mayor could get on with the job of deciding what he wanted his mayoralty to achieve. City Hall is not Downing Street, and the challenge confronting the next prime minister dwarfs anything faced by other recent holders of the post, let alone a London mayor. But there are surely lessons from the eight years Johnson spent in City Hall that could hint at his working style as prime minister \u2013 the first being that, having appointed Lister to lead his transition to government, it is clear he wants to avoid repeating the early dysfunction of 2008. Some Johnson supporters would like him to replicate his mayoralty as prime minister. Kulveer Ranger, who was his transport policy director, said: \u201cBoris has said himself he wants to govern the country as he governed London.\u201d His style, Ranger said, is to build up \u201ca very strong team around him. He doesn\u2019t like confrontations. He likes to have consensus \u2026 [but if there isn\u2019t one] he takes a decision.\u201d The \u201cBoris bubble\u201d, he added, \u201cis a fantastic place to be \u2013 it\u2019s hugely exciting\u201d. Guto Harri, recruited spontaneously by Johnson as his communications director after the former BBC journalist called his old Oxford University friend about something else two days before the May 2008 election, acknowledged the early months \u201clooked chaotic\u201d, but said Johnson took greater control with every departure, \u201cand the more he took charge, the more focused and determined we became, and the more we got done\u201d. Among other priorities, Harri said, Johnson focused on cutting what he saw as the wasteful spending of his predecessor, Ken Livingstone, including slashing the size of the party that had originally been due to fly to Beijing, and opting for economy class flights. But others who worked for, alongside or actively against him as mayor are less beguiled by the prospect of Johnson as prime minister. Jenny Jones, a deputy mayor under Livingstone who was a London assembly member during Johnson\u2019s tenure, said: \u201cA lot of us like him because he is charming and funny, and good to have a cup of coffee with, but none of us trust him. \u201cAnd even people who work for him get very edgy when you say things like that because they mostly agree. He is a charming companion, but you couldn\u2019t trust him to feed your cat if you were away one evening.\u201d At mayor\u2019s question time, Lady Jones said, Johnson \u201cwould come in straight off his bicycle, drop his helmet, then his bag, and somebody would bring him a cup of coffee. And you always got the feeling he hadn\u2019t read his papers.\u201d Not reading his briefs is a repeated criticism by opponents, political allies and even members of Johnson\u2019s mayoral campaign teams, but one former senior colleague insisted he was \u201cincredibly hardworking and diligent \u2026 but it seems sometimes that he doesn\u2019t want people to know he is that person.\u201d Caroline Pidgeon, a Liberal Democrat London assembly member, said: \u201cIn his first term, he used to constantly quote Latin at us. \u2018I\u2019m intellectually superior\u2019 \u2013 I think that\u2019s his general approach. I\u2019m above everything so I can do what I like.\u201d In 2012, Jennette Arnold, the chair of the London assembly, wrote to Johnson on behalf of female assembly members who felt the mayor \u201ctreated them in a disrespectful, patronising way at meetings and in a manner that you do not display when dealing with male AMs\u201d. Among the examples listed were Johnson repeatedly calling female colleagues \u201cdear\u201d, accusing one of \u201cchuntering on\u201d and describing the question of another as \u201cblah blah blah blah fishcakes\u201d. Johnson denied sexism. But it was not only political opponents who were riled. Boff said: \u201cHe hates being held to account \u2013 we [the Conservative group] weren\u2019t sycophants to Boris, and he hated that. He looked thoroughly hurt whenever we would challenge him, as if he had been stabbed in the back. But he got terribly intemperate when challenged, and he does have a temper on him.\u201d Tory critics questioning the number of skyscrapers he waved through despite promises to the contrary, or the deal Johnson signed off on the Olympic Stadium, saddling taxpayers with huge liabilities for decades to come, were referred to as the \u201cpass\u00e9 posse\u201d by the mayor\u2019s team. And when riots broke out in the capital in August 2011, he badly misjudged the public mood. Johnson had been on holiday in Canada with his family when the unrest began and initially refused to return (he later told colleagues his wife, Marina Wheeler, was too short to drive their rented Winnebago). When he finally made an appearance in south-west London three days later, he was heckled by residents shouting: \u201cWhere were the police?\u201d and \u201cWe want Ken Livingstone.\u201d He later defied advice to authorise the purchase of secondhand water cannon that were not licensed for use in the UK. Boff, who believes Johnson was a \u201cgood mayor, on the whole\u201d, said: \u201cBoris at his best is quite impressive. But Boris at his worst is where he suddenly gets interested and distracted by something bright and shiny.\u201d And it is those shiny, personally driven projects about which Johnson was so enthusiastic that have arguably come to define his mayoralty, despite some achievements for which even his political foes give him credit, such as pushing through segregated cycle lanes and delivering the bike-hire scheme that had been developed under Livingstone. Johnson claims to have halved the capital\u2019s murder rate, reduced knife crime and cut poverty, but these achievements are disputed. Where Livingstone bequeathed the Oyster card, the congestion charging zone and the Olympics, Johnson\u2019s legacy includes a \u00a360m cable car across post-industrial east London that serves little transport purpose, new Routemaster buses bought for \u00a3300m that had to be expensively retrofitted because they became unbearably hot, and the \u00a36m Orbit tower and slide, commissioned in a flap by Johnson when he felt the Olympic site needed \u201csomething extra\u201d and was costing taxpayers \u00a310,000 a week by the end of his mayoralty. A scheme to build an airport on an island in the Thames estuary cost more than \u00a35m in feasibility studies but came to nothing, while the garden bridge, an idea suggested by his friend Joanna Lumley, cost \u00a343m of public money without a brick being laid. Asked if he had any regrets, Johnson \u2013 whose campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this article \u2013 said he would have built it faster. With that scheme finally cancelled, his Routemasters no longer in production owing to cost, his water cannon sold for scrap last year at a huge loss and his cable car being used by four commuters a week, Johnson\u2019s legacy is looking increasingly slight. So what did he actually want to achieve as mayor? Tony Travers, a professor of government at the London School of Economics, who has closely observed successive mayors and advised Johnson on transport policy, said: \u201cThe ambition is to be in the office. I\u2019m not sure that once in office, his goal is for well-thought-out objectives and policies.\u201d And yet, said Travers, it is instructive to remember the \u201clamentable\u201d expectations of Johnson in 2008. \u201cSo the fact that the tube kept going, that there were police on the streets, meant he appeared to do much better than expectations. That could easily happen again,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you become mayor of London or prime minister, huge numbers of people actually run things. In a curious way, the more he is subjected to criticism now, the more he will be seen to do well.\u201d",

I don\u2019t have a Racist bone in my body! The so-called vote to be taken is a Democrat con game. Republicans should not show \u2018weakness\u2019 and fall into their trap.\u201d</p> \n<p>Tuesday\u2019s tirade came less than 12 hours after the four legislators, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ilhan-omar\">Ilhan Omar</a> of Minnesota, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alexandria-ocasio-cortez\">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a> of New York, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/08/rashida-tlaib-muslim-woman-elected-us-congress-michigan\">Rashida Tlaib</a> of Michigan and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2018/nov/07/ayanna-pressley-massachusetts-first-black-congresswoman\">Ayanna Pressley</a> of Massachusetts, held a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/15/congresswomen-trump-racist-attack-aoc-pressley-omar-tlaib\">press conference</a> asking that Americans \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/15/congresswomen-trump-racist-attack-aoc-pressley-omar-tlaib\">do not take the bait</a>\u201d of Trump\u2019s divisive rhetoric</p> \n<p>Three of the women were born in the US, while Omar came to the country aged 12 as a refugee and took up American citizenship five years later.</p> \n<p>Trump stepped up the attacks as congressional Democrats planned to hold a formal vote in the House of Representatives on a resolution they have drafted condemning the onslaught, with little support expected from Republicans.</p> \n<p>Most of the Republican party\u2019s \u201cNeverTrump\u201d critics have resigned, retired or been cowed into silence by his raucous supporters.</p> \n<p>Asked if Trump\u2019s comments were racist, the top Republican in the House, Kevin McCarthy of California, said: \u201cThis is about ideology. And the ideology of the Democratic party is socialist. This debate is going to go on for a long time.\u201d</p> \n<p>Even McCarthy was forced to acknowledge, \u201cnobody believes somebody should leave the country.\u201d But he insisted: \u201cThe president is not a racist.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, on Tuesday afternoon at a press conference would not condemn the president and depicted Trump\u2019s racism as a two-sided war of words.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think everybody ought to tone down their rhetoric,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe president\u2019s not a racist. And I think the tone of all of this is not good for the country. But it\u2019s coming from all ideological points of view \u2026 to single out any segment of this I think is a mistake.\u201d</p> \n<p>When asked to explain the president\u2019s remarks, the White House adviser Kellyanne Conway asked reporter, Andrew Feinberg, what his ethnicity was.</p> \n<p>When Feinberg said it was \u201cnot relevant\u201d, Conway claimed it was \u201cbecause you\u2019re asking about, he said \u2018originally\u2019. He said \u2018originally from\u2019.\u201d</p> \n<p>In another tweet on Tuesday, Trump claimed Omar is \u201cpolling at 8%\u201d and, mistakenly truncating her name, \u201cCortez at 21%\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump escalated his verbal attacks on four progressive Democratic congresswomen on Tuesday, accusing them of \u201cspewing some of the most vile, hateful, and disgusting things ever said by a politician in the House or Senate\u201d. Trump has shown no remorse for weekend tweets that suggested the four women \u201cgo back\u201d to their \u201cbroken and crime-infested\u201d countries, a racist outburst that earned domestic and international condemnation. Instead, the US president intensified his attacks on the four women of color, claiming the inflammatory tweets he sent were not racist. There was a deeply sceptical reaction from politicians and others who have come to regard divisive bigotry as not an exception but a defining feature of his presidency. \u201cIf you hate our Country, or if you are not happy here, you can leave!\u201d Trump tweeted on Tuesday, adding: \u201cThose Tweets were NOT Racist. I don\u2019t have a Racist bone in my body! The so-called vote to be taken is a Democrat con game. Republicans should not show \u2018weakness\u2019 and fall into their trap.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s tirade came less than 12 hours after the four legislators, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, held a press conference asking that Americans \u201cdo not take the bait\u201d of Trump\u2019s divisive rhetoric Three of the women were born in the US, while Omar came to the country aged 12 as a refugee and took up American citizenship five years later. Trump stepped up the attacks as congressional Democrats planned to hold a formal vote in the House of Representatives on a resolution they have drafted condemning the onslaught, with little support expected from Republicans. Most of the Republican party\u2019s \u201cNeverTrump\u201d critics have resigned, retired or been cowed into silence by his raucous supporters. Asked if Trump\u2019s comments were racist, the top Republican in the House, Kevin McCarthy of California, said: \u201cThis is about ideology. And the ideology of the Democratic party is socialist. This debate is going to go on for a long time.\u201d Even McCarthy was forced to acknowledge, \u201cnobody believes somebody should leave the country.\u201d But he insisted: \u201cThe president is not a racist.\u201d The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, on Tuesday afternoon at a press conference would not condemn the president and depicted Trump\u2019s racism as a two-sided war of words. \u201cI think everybody ought to tone down their rhetoric,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president\u2019s not a racist. And I think the tone of all of this is not good for the country. But it\u2019s coming from all ideological points of view \u2026 to single out any segment of this I think is a mistake.\u201d When asked to explain the president\u2019s remarks, the White House adviser Kellyanne Conway asked reporter, Andrew Feinberg, what his ethnicity was. When Feinberg said it was \u201cnot relevant\u201d, Conway claimed it was \u201cbecause you\u2019re asking about, he said \u2018originally\u2019. He said \u2018originally from\u2019.\u201d In another tweet on Tuesday, Trump claimed Omar is \u201cpolling at 8%\u201d and, mistakenly truncating her name, \u201cCortez at 21%\u201d. He said Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, had tried to push them away from the party but they \u201cnow represent\u201d the Democratic party. With a hint at how he hopes to turn the controversy to his electoral advantage, Trump added: \u201cSee you in 2020!\u201d The tirade came after the four congresswoman held a joint press conference on Monday in which they accused Trump of pushing \u201cthe agenda of white nationalists\u201d with \u201cxenophobic bigoted remarks\u201d and urged the public to \u201cnot take the bait\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Recently, I taught a course that had Stephen King\u2019s On Writing as a set text. The book opens with a section called \u201cCV\u201d, in which he describes the experiences that formed him as a writer. Exploring the genesis of his novel Carrie, he explains that its title character \u2013 the teenage outcast who enacts a horrific, telekinetic revenge on her tormentors \u2013 emerged from uneasy memories of two girls he knew during his own high school years. These girls looked wrong, sounded wrong. They dressed in the wrong clothes. Both came from unusual homes, but what made them \u2013 in King\u2019s words \u2013 the \u201ctwo loneliest and most reviled\u201d of the girls in his class was something less tangible than background. Returning to the subject in his introduction to my edition of Carrie, he suggests that this was a something \u201cthat broadcast STRANGE! NOT LIKE US! KEEP AWAY!\u201d</p> <p>King speculates that this broadcast occupied a \u201cwavelength only other kids can pick up\u201d, but I\u2019m not so sure people ever grow out of that receptiveness. They may learn to respond to it less unkindly, but they still sense it. There is even a word for the experience of sensing unplaceable difference: \u201cuncanny\u201d.</p> <p>The dictionary definition of \u201cuncanny\u201d is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/uncanny\" title=\"\">strange and difficult to explain</a>\u201d. King grapples at length with the question of what it was about those two girls that gave rise to uncanniness, but can come to no definite conclusion. Giving their fictional counterpart destructive telekinetic powers provided some kind of retrospective imaginary justification for the sense of discomfort they provoked. Reading King, I felt uncomfortable, too, but for a different reason. It seemed to me, as I read, that the something King describes \u2013 the something \u201coff\u201d \u2013 was not only his reviled classmates\u2019 something, and his character Carrie\u2019s something, but my something, too. I know what it is not only to encounter the uncanny but to be it.</p> <p>There was always something \u201cother\u201d about me, and people noticed it. They couldn\u2019t have said what it was they were noticing, but they sensed it in the room. I noticed them noticing. Sometimes, as I was walking down a street or a corridor, I would register that this person or that was visibly disconcerted by looking into my face. Sometimes they looked bewildered; sometimes they would even shrink back. It was the nameless something at work. Some people sensed it as vulnerability, explaining things to me very slowly and carefully, or asking me if I was OK. Sometimes people interpreted what they sensed as physical fragility and insisted on carrying things for me when I hadn\u2019t asked. Some people caught it the way predators catch the scent of prey. Some felt repulsed or a little threatened and shunned it. Most people, at least some of the time, laughed at it. A few were drawn towards it, and, when they laughed, laughed with it.</p> <p>In his <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/allanmc/www/freud1.pdf\" title=\"\">1919 paper on the uncanny</a>, Sigmund Freud quotes the influential German psychiatrist Ernst Jentsch, who writes that \u201cone of the most successful devices for easily creating uncanny effects is to leave the reader in uncertainty whether a particular figure in the story is a human being or automaton\u201d. One of the hard lessons of my life has been the realisation that to register automatically as a fellow human to other human beings, it is not enough to have a human body, a mind, the capacity to experience, bleed, laugh, etc, if somehow the way you hold yourself, walk, dress, speak and arrange your face fail to combine in such a way as to signal: \u201cI\u2019m like you.\u201d People seemed to read humanity \u2013 or the lack of it \u2013 off the surface. What I learned from their responses to me was that they could not always quite bring themselves to relate to me as human.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"461318dac4f61c643a6c40c4cb4bd5732449a78f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/461318dac4f61c643a6c40c4cb4bd5732449a78f/0_0_3150_1890/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sissy Spacek in Carrie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sissy Spacek in Carrie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When you are not quite human, the assumption is that you cannot be hurt, that you can be talked about as if you were not there. Being talked about as if one were not in the room \u2013 being objectified \u2013 is an experience most of us have had at some time. Most of us have probably done it to someone else. We do it routinely to children. Medical staff do it to patients. Along with the vast majority of other women, and some men, I have experienced it as street harassment. (\u201cDid you see her tits?\u201d) It is at best awkward, and at worst humiliating.</p> <p>It was partly the wish to avoid this humiliation that drove me to try to identify the thing about me that made people react so badly; identify it with a view to obliterating it. When I was playing an improvisation game in a drama lesson, and another girl made a pointed comment about a character wearing \u201cwhite knee socks\u201d, at which everyone but me laughed, I took a quick look round at all the legs in the circle and made a mental note to change what I wore on mine. When I was hurrying to an appointment at university, I heard laughter in front of me and then a voice behind me saying: \u201cWhat\u2019s funny? Is it her running?\u201d I made a further note, to run as little possible in public. When I attempted to join a conversation at my first workplace by telling a story that started with the phrase: \u201cYou know, once \u2026\u201d and one of the people I was trying to talk to turned to the others and said: \u201cYou know, once \u2026 I forgot what I was going to say, but I\u2019m sure it was a hilarious anecdote.\u201d I became positively phobic about using that particular opener ever again. A few months later, I was discreetly \u2013 I thought \u2013 reading a book and eating a sandwich on the tube on the way home; this time the shriek of laughter came from a woman a few seats along. She described me to her friend: \u201cFirst, she opens her mouth, then she picks a bit out of her teeth. Then she looks at it, then she flicks it away!\u201d It was news to me as well as to her friend: I had forgotten to remind myself that I was visible to other people even when I wasn\u2019t looking at them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I typed 'Asperger syndrome women' into Google \u2013 and there I was</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Over the years, I spent untold amounts of time and energy adjusting and tuning my surface so that it read more smoothly, in the hope that one day I would wake up like Pinocchio, and discover that I was real at last. I was always looking for signs that my efforts might be working. I married my husband because I love him, and had our child because I dearly wanted one. But it is also true that I saw marriage and motherhood as proof that I was getting there. As I navigated each coffee morning, shopping trip and school run, I marked every positive interaction as another step on the way to shedding my uncanny skin. Occasionally, I would force myself to mingle at a party: if I practised partying assiduously enough, I might actually enjoy it one day, and in that moment I would become, in Carrie\u2019s words, a \u201cproper person\u201d.</p> <p>Of course, the moment never came. No amount of conscious adjustment can fully compensate for a missing set of defaults. I accumulated failures and collected diagnoses \u2013 depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder. None of them were inaccurate, but they still left my otherness unaccounted for. Then, when I was in my late 30s, my family went through a crisis, and my brother took his own life.</p> <p>He had been struggling for a while. Not long before he died, he had been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and told me he was certain we all had it. I couldn\u2019t pursue the question while our mother was alive, but after she died of cancer three years later, I went back to it. While I was researching ADHD, and failing to find myself, I saw a Facebook post from a woman I had known at university, announcing a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome. I remembered this woman as sociable and empathic. I had thought Asperger\u2019s was rare in women. I typed \u201cAsperger syndrome women\u201d into Google \u2013 and there I was.</p> <p>I was lucky: my county has an NHS service for diagnosing adults. I was also lucky to have an older cousin who, in the absence of any living parents, was able to give the psychologist a sense of me as a small child. Apparently, I walked on my toes, flapped when I got frustrated and talked at people. I brought along some letters from my childhood: one from an educational psychologist who noted my advanced \u201creading age\u201d, but thought I may be deaf, and another couple from a speech therapist commenting on my lack of eye contact. I got the diagnosis.</p> <p>That was seven years ago. Since then, I have diverted some of the energy I had been pouring into the work of changing myself into the more rewarding work of accepting my difference. I have learned about the cultural history of autism and disability, about ableism and how we come to internalise it. I found other autistic women, in books and online. Some, like me, could speak and write; some wrote beautifully, but could not speak. I also found non-autistic people who wrote with love of autistic family members who were not able to speak nor write. I learned that while some autistic people are not able to adjust their surfaces and might appear more \u201cother\u201d than I do, I can still recognise their experience of the world and their embodiment as similar to mine. Then one day, I sat face to face with another autistic woman for the first time, and saw in her expression not a reflection of my uncanniness, but myself \u2013 my differently, but properly, human self.</p> <p><em>Others: Writers on the Power of Words to Help Us See Beyond Ourselves, edited by Charles Fernyhough, is published by Unbound at \u00a39.99.

When you are not quite human, the assumption is that you cannot be hurt, that you can be talked about as if you were not there. Being talked about as if one were not in the room \u2013 being objectified \u2013 is an experience most of us have had at some time. Most of us have probably done it to someone else. We do it routinely to children. Medical staff do it to patients. Along with the vast majority of other women, and some men, I have experienced it as street harassment. (\u201cDid you see her tits?\u201d) It is at best awkward, and at worst humiliating. It was partly the wish to avoid this humiliation that drove me to try to identify the thing about me that made people react so badly; identify it with a view to obliterating it. When I was playing an improvisation game in a drama lesson, and another girl made a pointed comment about a character wearing \u201cwhite knee socks\u201d, at which everyone but me laughed, I took a quick look round at all the legs in the circle and made a mental note to change what I wore on mine. When I was hurrying to an appointment at university, I heard laughter in front of me and then a voice behind me saying: \u201cWhat\u2019s funny? Is it her running?\u201d I made a further note, to run as little possible in public. When I attempted to join a conversation at my first workplace by telling a story that started with the phrase: \u201cYou know, once \u2026\u201d and one of the people I was trying to talk to turned to the others and said: \u201cYou know, once \u2026 I forgot what I was going to say, but I\u2019m sure it was a hilarious anecdote.\u201d I became positively phobic about using that particular opener ever again. A few months later, I was discreetly \u2013 I thought \u2013 reading a book and eating a sandwich on the tube on the way home; this time the shriek of laughter came from a woman a few seats along. She described me to her friend: \u201cFirst, she opens her mouth, then she picks a bit out of her teeth. Then she looks at it, then she flicks it away!\u201d It was news to me as well as to her friend: I had forgotten to remind myself that I was visible to other people even when I wasn\u2019t looking at them. Over the years, I spent untold amounts of time and energy adjusting and tuning my surface so that it read more smoothly, in the hope that one day I would wake up like Pinocchio, and discover that I was real at last. I was always looking for signs that my efforts might be working. I married my husband because I love him, and had our child because I dearly wanted one. But it is also true that I saw marriage and motherhood as proof that I was getting there. As I navigated each coffee morning, shopping trip and school run, I marked every positive interaction as another step on the way to shedding my uncanny skin. Occasionally, I would force myself to mingle at a party: if I practised partying assiduously enough, I might actually enjoy it one day, and in that moment I would become, in Carrie\u2019s words, a \u201cproper person\u201d. Of course, the moment never came. No amount of conscious adjustment can fully compensate for a missing set of defaults. I accumulated failures and collected diagnoses \u2013 depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder. None of them were inaccurate, but they still left my otherness unaccounted for. Then, when I was in my late 30s, my family went through a crisis, and my brother took his own life. He had been struggling for a while. Not long before he died, he had been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and told me he was certain we all had it. I couldn\u2019t pursue the question while our mother was alive, but after she died of cancer three years later, I went back to it. While I was researching ADHD, and failing to find myself, I saw a Facebook post from a woman I had known at university, announcing a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome. I remembered this woman as sociable and empathic. I had thought Asperger\u2019s was rare in women. I typed \u201cAsperger syndrome women\u201d into Google \u2013 and there I was. I was lucky: my county has an NHS service for diagnosing adults. I was also lucky to have an older cousin who, in the absence of any living parents, was able to give the psychologist a sense of me as a small child. Apparently, I walked on my toes, flapped when I got frustrated and talked at people. I brought along some letters from my childhood: one from an educational psychologist who noted my advanced \u201creading age\u201d, but thought I may be deaf, and another couple from a speech therapist commenting on my lack of eye contact. I got the diagnosis. That was seven years ago. Since then, I have diverted some of the energy I had been pouring into the work of changing myself into the more rewarding work of accepting my difference. I have learned about the cultural history of autism and disability, about ableism and how we come to internalise it. I found other autistic women, in books and online. Some, like me, could speak and write; some wrote beautifully, but could not speak. I also found non-autistic people who wrote with love of autistic family members who were not able to speak nor write. I learned that while some autistic people are not able to adjust their surfaces and might appear more \u201cother\u201d than I do, I can still recognise their experience of the world and their embodiment as similar to mine. Then one day, I sat face to face with another autistic woman for the first time, and saw in her expression not a reflection of my uncanniness, but myself \u2013 my differently, but properly, human self.

The group has been told that its weekly 90-minute silent meditation sessions in the Old Palace must end in the autumn. The sessions were initiated by Christopher Collingwood, the canon chancellor of the minster, who practises and teaches Zen meditation and has described himself as \u201creligiously bilingual\u201d. On his Twitter feed, Collingwood says he is \u201cleader of York Zen Group (part of Wild Goose Zen Sangha in the White Plum Asanga)\u201d. A book by Collingwood, Zen Wisdom for Christians, which argues that the practice of Zen can lead Christians towards deeper spirituality, was published in May. A launch party for the book was held at the minster\u2019s Chapter House, and the book is on sale in the minster shop. But the dean of York Minster, the Right Rev Dr Jonathan Frost, who was installed in February, is believed to have decided to end the minster\u2019s association with the Zen group. Three years ago, conservative Christian evangelicals criticised the minster for allowing Zen meditation to be practised within its grounds, saying Buddhism was incompatible with Christianity. Christian Concern said that mixing Buddhism and Christianity was \u201cdeceptive\u201d and dishonoured Jesus. \u201cIt is remarkable that this is happening at one of the country\u2019s best-known cathedrals,\u201d said Andrea Williams, a member of the Church of England\u2019s general synod. At the time Vivienne Faull, who was then dean, said the sessions aimed \u201cto offer an opportunity for Christians and others to come together and learn about and explore Zen meditation practices and the congruence of Zen with the Christian faith\u201d. The group was not a religious order and had never met within the cathedral, she said. \u201cThe chapter of York would not give permission for any such religious order to be set up at York Minster.\u201d Collingwood told the Guardian the group would be searching for a new venue \u201cfor a number of reasons\u201d.

      "body": "<p>During debates about who is the best boxer of all time, the former four-weight world champion Pernell \u201cSweet Pea\u201d Whitaker is sometimes overlooked. He was not a fearsome puncher, nor was he a braggart who commanded headlines in the era before social media when newspaper reporters treasured outrageous quotes to sell a fight. But his peers always rated him among the sport\u2019s elite.</p> <p>Whitaker, who has died aged 55 after being hit by a car while crossing a road in his hometown of Virginia Beach, Virginia, was an Olympic gold medallist for the US at the Los Angeles games of 1984, after which he turned professional, first becoming a world champion as a lightweight in 1989. He eventually quit boxing in 2001, having fought in a total of 23 world title contests, of which he lost only three and drew one, in hugely controversial circumstances against the Mexican fighter Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez.</p> <p>One of his beaten opponents was the Scot Gary Jacobs, who challenged Whitaker for the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/27/sports/boxing-whitaker-fends-off-jacobs-for-decision.html\" title=\"\">WBC welterweight title in Atlantic City in August 1995</a>. Jacobs had reigned as a British, Commonwealth and European champion but, like so many others, found Whitaker\u2019s southpaw style and brilliant defensive skills almost impossible to fathom and he lost widely on points.</p> <p>After learning of his old adversary\u2019s death, Jacobs said: \u201cIf you want to learn boxing, watch his fights. His ringcraft was just incredible. He was so clever. He was almost impossible to hit cleanly. His skills were truly remarkable. People talk about great fighters, particularly at lightweight with men like Roberto Dur\u00e1n and Floyd Mayweather, but I think that he was the best of the lot.\u201d</p> <p>The former world heavyweight champion George Foreman said: \u201cIt was like watching a cat with boxing gloves. The best balance I ever saw in a boxer.\u201d </p> <p>Born in the tough Virginia coastal city of Norfolk, best known for its military bases, Pernell was one of seven children. His parents, Raymond and Novella, encouraged their son to pursue sports and he first went to a boxing gym aged eight, when it was quickly apparent that young Pernell had an aptitude for it. He was known to his family as Pete, after one of his uncles, and at an early boxing show, Whitaker\u2019s mother had been calling out the name \u201cSweet Pete\u201d only to see it misreported in a local newspaper as \u201cSweet Pea\u201d. Ever thereafter, it seems, the name stuck.</p> <p>Whitaker claimed to have had more than 500 contests as an amateur before his Olympic success. In 1984 he was captain of a US team that included Evander Holyfield, Mark Breland, Meldrick Taylor and Frank Tate, all medallists who would go on to become professional world champions.</p> <p>Whitaker turned pro under the promotion and management of the Duva family, and was trained by the extrovert patriarch <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/sports/lou-duva-dead-boxing-promoter-manager.html\" title=\"\">Lou</a>. After a run of 15 straight wins, he lost on a dubious points decision in a world lightweight title challenge in France in 1988, but scored a convincing points victory over Greg Haugen to become the IBF lightweight champion the following year.</p> <p>The win marked the beginning of Whitaker\u2019s era of glory. By the time he fought Ch\u00e1vez in 1993, in front of a 60,000 crowd at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas, he had recorded 17 straight victories and had been a world champion at three weights \u2013 lightweight, super lightweight and welterweight. Defending the WBC welterweight title against a man who was undefeated in 87 professional contests, Whitaker was awarded a majority draw in an outrageous judging decision when virtually every ringside expert believed Whitaker had won clearly. Whitaker\u2019s verdict was unequivocal: \u201cI whipped his ass.\u201d</p> <p>In 1995 he took the WBA super welterweight title, but alcohol and drug problems blighted the later stages of his career. After losing his welterweight world title on points in another disputed decision to Oscar De La Hoya in 1997, he was banned from the sport after testing positive for cocaine, and lost again on points in 1999 to the Puerto Rican F\u00e9lix Trinidad in his comeback for a final world title contest. In all, Whitaker won 40 pro fights, lost four and drew one with one no contest.</p> <p>After retiring, he worked sporadically as a coach. He was sent to prison in 2003 for violating the terms of a probation order imposed for cocaine possession. As the fortune he earned in boxing was frittered away, he once more was in the headlines in 2014 when he won a court order to have his mother and two of his siblings evicted from a house he had bought 30 years earlier so that he could sell the property to cope with his mounting debts.</p> <p>His marriage, to his childhood sweetheart, Rovanda Anthony, whom he wed in a boxing ring in Virginia Beach in 1985, ended in divorce. He is survived by his mother, and by three sons, Dominique, Dantavious and Devon, and a daughter, Tiara. Another son, Pernell Jr, predeceased him.</p> <p> \u2022 Pernell Whitaker, boxer, born 2 January 1964; died 14 July 2019</p>",

The win marked the beginning of Whitaker\u2019s era of glory. By the time he fought Ch\u00e1vez in 1993, in front of a 60,000 crowd at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas, he had recorded 17 straight victories and had been a world champion at three weights \u2013 lightweight, super lightweight and welterweight. Defending the WBC welterweight title against a man who was undefeated in 87 professional contests, Whitaker was awarded a majority draw in an outrageous judging decision when virtually every ringside expert believed Whitaker had won clearly. Whitaker\u2019s verdict was unequivocal: \u201cI whipped his ass.\u201d In 1995 he took the WBA super welterweight title, but alcohol and drug problems blighted the later stages of his career. After losing his welterweight world title on points in another disputed decision to Oscar De La Hoya in 1997, he was banned from the sport after testing positive for cocaine, and lost again on points in 1999 to the Puerto Rican F\u00e9lix Trinidad in his comeback for a final world title contest. In all, Whitaker won 40 pro fights, lost four and drew one with one no contest. After retiring, he worked sporadically as a coach. He was sent to prison in 2003 for violating the terms of a probation order imposed for cocaine possession. As the fortune he earned in boxing was frittered away, he once more was in the headlines in 2014 when he won a court order to have his mother and two of his siblings evicted from a house he had bought 30 years earlier so that he could sell the property to cope with his mounting debts. His marriage, to his childhood sweetheart, Rovanda Anthony, whom he wed in a boxing ring in Virginia Beach in 1985, ended in divorce. He is survived by his mother, and by three sons, Dominique, Dantavious and Devon, and a daughter, Tiara. Another son, Pernell Jr, predeceased him. \u2022 Pernell Whitaker, boxer, born 2 January 1964; died 14 July 2019",

      "bodyText": "The first transgender man to give birth and seek to be called the child\u2019s father has lost a high court case to protect his privacy despite warning that he and his child could be victimised and bullied as a result. Freddy McConnell, 32, a Guardian multimedia journalist who transitioned from female to male before giving birth in 2018, can now be named as the first person to give birth who wants to be registered as the child\u2019s father. McConnell had been living as a male for several years, including taking testosterone from the age of 25 and undergoing chest reshaping surgery in Florida, before he sought to get pregnant, which required him to stop taking testosterone. Prior to attending a fertility clinic he applied for a gender recognition certificate, which was granted before he gave birth. This meant he was legally male when his child was born. But when he went to register the birth and insisted he should be registered as the father, the registrar said he could only be registered as the child\u2019s mother. McConnell sought a judicial review in the family division of the high court of that decision and during the case, which has yet to conclude, his identity and that of his child were protected by an anonymity order. However, media organisations requested that order was lifted, arguing that McConnell had been cooperating with a documentary about the conception, pregnancy and birth of his child, using his real name, and that he had been interviewed about his experiences in the Guardian. The judgment on whether he should be allowed to be called the child\u2019s father is expected later this week. Lawyers for the Telegraph Media Group, Associated Newspapers, News Group Newspapers and Reach PLC said McConnell had \u201cput himself at the forefront of the debate on transgender rights\u201d and it was legitimate for them to want to name him as claiming the right to be called the child\u2019s father. They said there was public interest in the question of how the law should recognise transgender parenthood and that it was artificial for the public not to make the link between the man in the documentary exploring the reality of giving birth and the man in court challenging the law. McConnell\u2019s lawyers had argued that linking his name to the case was unfair given the amount of adverse comment including \u201cinsensitive and sarcastic\u201d reporting in Mail Online\u2019s coverage of the anonymised hearings. They warned that he would be the subject of online trolling, doorstepping by the media and other distressing behaviour. Lawyers representing his child also argued that if the father\u2019s name was known the potential for the child to \u201cbe the target of playground bullies was all too plain\u201d and that reporting about the case would not benefit from naming McConnell, while the consequences for the child would be \u201cextreme\u201d. Responding to the ruling, McConnell said: \u201cProtecting my child has always been and will always be my number one concern. This was the purpose of the anonymity order. Now that my anonymity has been lifted, I embrace the opportunity to draw focus on to the need for equality in this area of the law. All children should be able to have their legal parents correctly and accurately recorded on their birth certificates.\u201d His legal team said the UK\u2019s system of birth registration does not treat families equally and that unless it is changed McConnell is being forced to register as \u201cmother\u201d on his child\u2019s birth certificate. They said this was the case for all transgender fathers, whether or not they carry their babies, and for transgender women, who are forced to register as \u201cfather\u201d in all circumstances. His lawyer, Karen Holden, said: \u201cHaving an accurate birth certificate is vital as it stays with someone for their entire life and forms part of their identity. We took on this case to support changing a part of UK law that denies equality, creates inaccurate documentation and fails to serve multiple groups with the LGBTQ+ community\u201d. When McConnell was born, his registered gender was female. He realised he was trans in 2010, aged 23, and lived as a male, starting testosterone treatment in April 2013. In 2016, he sought advice from a fertility clinic about getting pregnant and his hormone treatment was suspended, his menstrual cycle restarted and he became pregnant in 2017 through artificial insemination using sperm from a donor. His case demanding to be registered as the child\u2019s father was heard at the high court in February, but the court reconvened in May after it emerged that McConnell was co-operating with the documentary Seahorse, about the conception, pregnancy and birth, which had been shown at film festivals and is set to be broadcast later this year by the BBC.

      "bodyText": "Name: Kate Winslet. Age: 43. All right. At least I know what she looks looks like. Good. Remember she\u2019s just an ordinary, down-to-earth, seven times Oscar-nominated mum. And a multimillionaire? Yes, I expect so, although she doesn\u2019t like to make a big thing out of it. She lives in Sussex, does the school run, brings homemade biscuits to interviews. Didn\u2019t she win an Oscar too? Yes, that\u2019s right, for The Reader, in 2009. \u201cWaitrose, Oscars. It really is that bonkers,\u201d she has said. \u201cHonestly, I push my shopping trolley past the aisles of gossip magazines and I often just go: \u2018Who the fuck are all these people and what the fuck are they doing?\u2019\u201d She\u2019s one of us. I thought she was quite posh. Why\u2019s that? She sounds posh. And English actors always are, aren\u2019t they? Unless they\u2019re, say, Sean Bean or Ray Winstone. That might be a slight generalisation. And it doesn\u2019t apply to Winslet anyway. Her parents were both impoverished actors. She grew up in Reading with very little money, and her ancestors were destitute. How do you know that? She has just found out, on that Who Do You Think You Are? show. Her great-great-grandfather came to the UK from Sweden in 1884, which \u201cbasically means I\u2019m an immigrant\u201d, she says. One-sixteenth immigrant, at any rate. Going further back, her great-great-great-great-grandfather, Anders Jonsson, was jailed for stealing potatoes and honey to feed his family. Obviously that\u2019s sad. Yes. But I mean we all have 64 great-great-great-great-grandparents, give or take a bit of overlapping. Wouldn\u2019t most people have at least one peasant on the list? Why must you take the fun out of everything? I\u2019m not trying to. It\u2019s just that almost everyone was poor in the early 19th century, so if you go back far enough \u2026 You\u2019re missing the point. This stuff can completely transform someone\u2019s idea of themselves. Remember Danny Dyer? The Geezer Laureate? That\u2019s him. When he had his turn on the programme he discovered a direct line of descent from King Edward III, who was his \u201c22-times-great-grandfather\u201d. Were there any other interesting names among the millions of other ancestors from that generation? You can scoff, but it was a very moving moment for the \u201ckid from Canning Town\u201d, and Winslet\u2019s discovery meant a lot to her, too. Really? Her parents \u201cwould have been upset and disgusted if I had come from wealth or royalty\u201d, she said. Yes. Much better to end up there, ideally. Indeed.

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.</p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europeif there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He described Johnson as having been \u201cpassionate about the environment for decades\u201d, claiming that when they first met \u201che described himself to me without prompting as a passionately green Tory and in every role he has had he has championed the environment\u201d.</p> \n<p>Labour has called Johnson\u2019s commitment to tackling the climate emergency into question, pointing out that he denied climate science <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/05/boris-johnson-challenged-by-labour-over-climate-science\">as recently as 2015</a> when he described it as \u201cwithout foundation\u201d.</p> \n<p>Pressed on whether he would serve in the cabinet of Johnson, who is willing to carry out a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, Gove said: \u201cWhoever is the prime minister, if they wanted me to serve in their government I would be happy to do so.

      "bodyText": "The number of first-time applications for Irish passports from Great Britain has risen sharply since the EU referendum with five times as many people interesting in acquiring one. In Northern Ireland, where all citizens are entitled to an Irish passport, the number of first-time applications has more than doubled. In the year to 30 June, the number of applications from Great Britain was 31,099 and 47,645 from Northern Ireland, according to figures issued in Ireland in response to a parliamentary question to the deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney. This compares with 6,011 applications made from Great Britain in 2015, the year before the referendum, and 20,325 from Northern Ireland. Historical links between the UK and Ireland have meant that Britain has an enduring place in Irish emigration annals, with children and grandchildren of Irish-born citizens entitled to an Irish passport. Interest in acquiring Irish passports has surged since the referendum amid fears of queues at airports and the loss of a host of other rights that come with citizenship, including access to the European health insurance card (EHIC) for health cover while on holiday and the Erasmus university scheme. The Irish government has said it will cover the EHIC and Erasmus costs for Irish citizens in Northern Ireland as part of its commitment to north-south cooperation, as outlined in the Good Friday agreement. The figures show a steady rise since 2015, with application numbers from Great Britain jumping to 18,000 in 2016 and 31,000 the year after. This year\u2019s figures are up 40% on 2018, when the number dropped back to 22,386. In March, the number of overall applications for Irish passports had risen to record levels with almost a quarter of a million requests since January, putting extra strain on passport offices. Coveney said at the time that the 230,000 applications represented a 30% increase on the same period last year. A record 860,000 Irish passports were issued last year, with about 200,000 coming from the UK, but the number is on course to rise even higher this year.",

      "body": "<p>Several weeks of Conservative leadership hustings and associated TV shows are now, barring a final event on Wednesday, finally over. So what have we learned about Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt during this electoral marathon?</p> <h2>Neither has shown a huge grasp of difficult details</h2> <p>Johnson\u2019s broad-brush approach is well known and arguably part of his appeal, and he coasted through most hustings events gaining applause by appealing for optimism and a can-do attitude. It did cost him in more forensic settings, such as Andrew Neil\u2019s exposure of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/13/tory-leadership-candidates-grilled-by-bbcs-andrew-neil\">Johnson\u2019s limited grasp</a> of possible post-Brexit tariff regimes.</p> <p>While Hunt\u2019s pitch to members was more technocratic, the substance was often similarly thin, especially on how he would produce a rapid new Brexit deal. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/02/hunt-pips-johnson-in-front-of-northern-irelands-small-band-of-tories\">hustings </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/02/hunt-pips-johnson-in-front-of-northern-irelands-small-band-of-tories\">in Belfast</a> was notable: any audience member hoping for clues on exactly how either candidate would prevent a hard Irish border would have left disappointed.</p> <h2>Neither yet has a definable political philosophy or a grand vision</h2> <p>The process brought a rash of policy proposals from both men, but these were mainly reactive and straightforward \u2013 tax cuts or more spending in popular areas. Anyone scouring for a sense of what Johnsonism or Huntism might involve as a prime ministerial credo would be none the wiser.</p> <p>Similarly, it would have been hard to guess that the UK faces a series of intricate, pressing political and social problems which are not Brexit: everything from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/04/matt-hancock-social-care-green-paper-partisan-politics-health\">collapsing social care system</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/11/great-barrier-reef-hard-coral-cover-close-to-record-lows\">growing climate crisis</a> to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/mar/25/automation-threatens-15-million-workers-britain-says-ons\">uncertain future of work</a> in a mechanised age.

      "bodyText": "Several weeks of Conservative leadership hustings and associated TV shows are now, barring a final event on Wednesday, finally over. So what have we learned about Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt during this electoral marathon? Neither has shown a huge grasp of difficult details Johnson\u2019s broad-brush approach is well known and arguably part of his appeal, and he coasted through most hustings events gaining applause by appealing for optimism and a can-do attitude. It did cost him in more forensic settings, such as Andrew Neil\u2019s exposure of Johnson\u2019s limited grasp of possible post-Brexit tariff regimes. While Hunt\u2019s pitch to members was more technocratic, the substance was often similarly thin, especially on how he would produce a rapid new Brexit deal. The hustings in Belfast was notable: any audience member hoping for clues on exactly how either candidate would prevent a hard Irish border would have left disappointed. Neither yet has a definable political philosophy or a grand vision The process brought a rash of policy proposals from both men, but these were mainly reactive and straightforward \u2013 tax cuts or more spending in popular areas. Anyone scouring for a sense of what Johnsonism or Huntism might involve as a prime ministerial credo would be none the wiser. Similarly, it would have been hard to guess that the UK faces a series of intricate, pressing political and social problems which are not Brexit: everything from the collapsing social care system to the growing climate crisis to the uncertain future of work in a mechanised age. These subjects were aired, but little was said beyond platitudes. Leadership campaigns are often about glossing over difficult problems. But the lack of vision, even of political curiosity, was striking, and Brexit cannot be blamed for all of it. Austerity is well and truly over Or at least it will be should either candidate actually deliver on the many tax and spending promises they lavished about during the campaign \u2013 by no means a foregone conclusion, especially in a hung parliament. Either way the largesse of the candidates\u2019 promises was striking, with both resorting almost daily to hypothetical raids on the \u00a326bn or so \u201cfiscal headroom\u201d built up by Philip Hammond, as if it was cash found down the back of the sofa rather than extra borrowing. Both pledged significant tax cuts, as well as significantly increased spending on everything from schools to police and defence. Perhaps the epitome came during the Yorkshire and Humber hustings at the start of the month, when Johnson promised to spend the \u00a339bn \u201cdivorce settlement\u201d if a no-deal Brexit ate up the fiscal headroom, then seemed to promise he would be somehow able to spend them both. This was incoherent, fiscally incontinent stuff. Having party members select leaders is not always a good idea Earlier in the month the Tory grandee Ken Clarke argued that internal democracy had ruined both Labour and the Conservatives. He was only half-joking. Clarke\u2019s point is that while MPs might reflect a fairly consensual view of constituency opinion, members tend to represent the most robust end of opinion in a party. The hustings demonstrated this phenomenon. Having to appeal to 140,000 or so predominantly ultra-Brexit, low-tax, low-regulation voters, rather than the wider electorate, meant neither Johnson or Hunt had any incentive to temper their messages, which were nudged down the policy slipway as the process went on. Arguably the culmination was Monday evening, when both Johnson and Hunt said that even a reformed Irish backstop could not be tolerated and the EU would have to ditch the entire idea \u2013 thus committing both men, in effect, to pushing for a no-deal Brexit. Of course, policy positions can be wound back once inside No 10, but when hustings are televised, recorded and tweeted, this is much harder to do. Hustings should only be listened to once In the era before livestreaming, this was precisely what happened \u2013 for the most part the only people who heard what was said at a particular hustings event were the regional members and assorted media in the room. But amid huge interest in the battle, each event was pored over, with one quick lesson soon emerging \u2013 both Hunt and Johnson basically made the same pitches each time and, for the most part, repeated listenings soon became tedious. Thus we learned that Hunt is congenitally incapable of speaking for more than about 40 seconds without mentioning that he set up a business; similarly, it became very clear early on that Johnson much prefers to talk about his time as London mayor than his more recent stint as foreign secretary. After a few events it even became possible to track several minutes in advance the trajectory of Johnson\u2019s laborious jokes, such as a regular, groan-inducing line about not having to worry about dairy goods shortages in a no-deal Brexit because \u201cwhere there\u2019s a will there\u2019s a whey\u201d.",

This heated debate about Seth Rogen\u2019s naughty food animation perhaps best reflects the public\u2019s changing attitudes towards film ratings. Yes, we are happy with consensual sex, and yes we adore nudity \u2013 but what we can\u2019t stand is the gratuitously pornographic. Not even when it comes to randy anthropomorphised supermarket foods.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a particular sequence where different types of food have an orgy and there are a lot of pornographic references, visual and verbal,\u201d explains Emily Fussell, the BBFC\u2019s education officer. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a prolonged scene. We showed it in our focus groups and the feedback was that they wouldn\u2019t expect to see as many pornographic references in a film at 15.\u201d</p> <p>The film has not been reclassified, but the public\u2019s sensibility has been noted.

Although as Sarah Peacock points out sternly: \u201cWe are <em>not</em> censors. We are enablers. We believe adults should be free to choose their own material. We will only intervene if material is in breach of UK legislation.\u201d</p> <p>Peacock, my guide for the day, is in charge of the compliance officers \u2013 the people who watch films and classify them as U, PG, 12, 12A (suitable for children younger than 12 if accompanied by an adult), 15, 18 and R18 (adult works for licensed premises only). They very occasionally refuse to classify them at all \u2013 the last time that happened was in 2012 for a horror movie called Hate Crime about a group of neo-Nazis breaking into a Jewish family\u2019s home.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/12/cut-is-this-the-death-of-sex-in-cinema\">Cut! Is this the death of sex in cinema?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The classifiers\u2019 job has changed hugely over the years. Initially they simply rated films for theatrical release. Then came trailers, TV shows, videos, DVDs and streaming services. \u201cNowadays <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/netflix\">Netflix</a> is our biggest customer,\u201d says Peacock.</p> <p>She takes me on a tour of the rabbit warren. We head towards the cinema where staff monitor films for theatrical release. It could pass for a bijou repertory cinema. The compliance officer is sitting at the back with his laptop and a translator, watching a south Asian family film. This movie isn\u2019t going to cause him any problems. Astonishingly, the BBFC only has nine full-time compliance officers to oversee all the material it rates. Last year, with the help of Peacock and five freelancers, they classified 1,036 cinema films, 1,143 cinema trailers, 139 cinema advertisements, 4,266 video submissions, 4,630 online submissions, 52 music videos and 295 video trailers. Most of the BBFC\u2019s staff are film buffs. Peacock has a degree in film studies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63d05ef9170622ea6e91f229894606229cc09851\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63d05ef9170622ea6e91f229894606229cc09851/0_0_2971_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Notorious \u2026 In the Realm of the Senses.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"727\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Notorious \u2026 In the Realm of the Senses.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photo 12/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the floor above are a series of tiny offices where compliance staff watch material made for TV on their computers. \u201cThey are rather small,\u201d says Peacock. \u201cI lived in one of these for three and a bit years.\u201d One officer is clearly obsessed with Julie Christie, while another has a poster of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jun/22/the-graduate-review-anne-bancroft-dustin-hoffman\">The Graduate</a> on the wall, featuring a young Dustin Hoffman, the half-stockinged leg of Anne Bancroft and the speech bubble: \u201cMrs Robinson, you\u2019re trying to seduce me \u2026 aren\u2019t you?\u201d When first released, the film was rated X (which meant 16 and over in the 1960s) because of its risque content \u2013 Hoffman\u2019s young man has an affair with Bancroft\u2019s middle-aged wife. In 2017 it was reclassified 12A.</p> <p>Back in Peacock\u2019s office, she tells me about a recent survey in which 10,000 people were asked about what they found offensive \u2013 a study that resulted in new guidelines being implemented earlier this year. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Teens are supportive of us being more restrictive on sexual violence. The idea that they don\u2019t care is a myth</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe public are generally more accepting of the use of the F-word and occasional uses of the C-word.\u201d Is she normally so reserved when it comes to her Fs and Cs? She smiles. \u201cNo. We say the actual words. I\u2019m being polite for you.\u201d</p> <p>There are, of course, still spats about language. In 2012 director Ken Loach and scriptwriter Paul Laverty were appalled that they had to restrict themselves to seven uses of the word \u201ccunt\u201d in order for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jun/03/angels-share-ken-loach-review\">The Angels\u2019 Share</a> to get a 15 rating. Laverty argued: \u201c\u2018You wee cunt\u2019 is often a term of endearment \u2026 There are many films they have given a 15 certificate that I think are full of pornographic violence or racism or cruelty that is not fit for 15-year-olds. I think there is tremendous hypocrisy.\u201d</p> <p>The more liberal attitude towards sex is not just a recent thing. It\u2019s 19 years since the occult thriller <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/05/dont-look-now-review-roeg-horror-julie-christie-donald-sutherland\">Don\u2019t Look Now</a> was downgraded to 15. But when the film was released in 1973, there was much debate about whether its stars Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland were really having sex in one erotic and desperately moving scene. That\u2019s a far cry from today, when an erection is not necessarily a no-no in non-adult cinema.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32974739798845a886714fc5dd5a6102eb9868a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32974739798845a886714fc5dd5a6102eb9868a4/0_84_1772_1063/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Downgraded \u2026 Don\u2019t Look Now.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Downgraded \u2026 Don\u2019t Look Now.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cinetext Bildarchiv/Allstar/CASEY PRODUCTIONS/STUDIOCANAL</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere are examples where we\u2019ve passed erections at 15,\u201d Peacock says. Genuine erections? \u201cI would imagine they were prosthetic. The Melissa McCarthy film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/04/spy-review-melissa-mccarthy-hotshot-heroine\">S</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/04/spy-review-melissa-mccarthy-hotshot-heroine\">py</a> features a scene in which an erection is briefly seen on a smartphone screen. We consulted on that issue and the public told us that if they are brief and they occur in a comic context, and its not intended to arouse or titillate, then there might be leniency for that at 15.\u201d But classification is not an exact science \u2013 one viewer\u2019s amusement may be another\u2019s arousal. As for nudity in general, the BBFC has no restrictions so long as it is in a \u201cnatural context\u201d.</p> <p>So what have we become less tolerant of? Sexual violence and discrimination, Peacock says. \u201cTeenagers are particularly supportive of [us] being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/16/scenes-rape-banned-uk-films-rated-suitable-under-15s\">more restrictive on sexual violence</a>. The idea that they don\u2019t care about what they\u2019re watching is a myth.\u201d In the BBFC\u2019s consultation, young people felt the scenes of sexual violence and suicide in the Netflix series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/13-reasons-why\">13 Reasons Why</a> were correctly placed at 18. (This week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/16/netflix-cuts-controversial-suicide-scene-from-13-reasons-why\">Netflix cut the suicide scene</a> altogether.)</p> <p>Sexual violence is a broad category \u2013 covering harassment, assault and rape \u2013 and this year the BBFC has made it a distinct category for the first time. \u201cSexual violence was previously in with violence, now we\u2019ve separated it out,\u201d says Peacock. Horror is also an increasingly delicate area. \u201cWe are more sensitive to the idea of psychological threat and the impact this has on the viewer. We tend to be a bit more restrictive than our American counterpart when it comes to horror. A lot of films here get a 15 here whereas in the States they might get a PG-13.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5f3f8e88617fa1798e36664f50e45ecc14500f0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f3f8e88617fa1798e36664f50e45ecc14500f0c/0_0_713_1000/713.jpg\" alt=\"Refused classification \u2026 a poster for Hate Crime.\" width=\"713\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Refused classification \u2026 a poster for Hate Crime.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As for discrimination, the BBFC is now reclassifying some old classics in light of changing attitudes. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/aug/31/actionandadventure.drama\">The Dam Busters</a>, for instance, was recently upgraded from a U to PG. \u201cOne of the contributing factors that took it up to PG was the name of their dog \u2013 it\u2019s called the N-word. We have <a href=\"https://bbfc.co.uk/releases/dam-busters-1955\">a case study</a> on our website explaining why the rating changed.

      "bodyText": "Down in the basement of the British Board of Film Classification\u2019s headquarters, the experts are discussing Sausage Party. This heated debate about Seth Rogen\u2019s naughty food animation perhaps best reflects the public\u2019s changing attitudes towards film ratings. Yes, we are happy with consensual sex, and yes we adore nudity \u2013 but what we can\u2019t stand is the gratuitously pornographic. Not even when it comes to randy anthropomorphised supermarket foods. \u201cThere\u2019s a particular sequence where different types of food have an orgy and there are a lot of pornographic references, visual and verbal,\u201d explains Emily Fussell, the BBFC\u2019s education officer. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a prolonged scene. We showed it in our focus groups and the feedback was that they wouldn\u2019t expect to see as many pornographic references in a film at 15.\u201d The film has not been reclassified, but the public\u2019s sensibility has been noted. If Sausage Party is resubmitted by distributors \u2013 say, for a special anniversary edition \u2013 it would likely be upgraded to an 18. The BBFC is based, appropriately enough, in London\u2019s Soho, at the heart of the British film industry. It\u2019s housed in a tall, skinny wedding cake of a building with Tardis-like properties. Once inside you find yourself walking endless twisting corridors galore \u2013 the kind of rabbit warren you might find in David Lynch\u2019s Inland Empire. Wherever you stand there are plaques and posters marking the great causes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres of classification, from A Clockwork Orange (withdrawn by its director Stanley Kubrick amid claims of copycat violence) to Freaks (banned for 30 years in Britain because it featured actors with severe disabilities, now reclassified as a 12A) and In the Realm of the Senses, which the BBFC initially recommended should be shown under private cinema club conditions to avoid the need for heavy cuts (speaking of which, one of its most notorious scenes features a former sex worker lopping off her lover\u2019s penis). In the Realm of the Senses was later reclassified and became one of the first films featuring explicit sex to be rated 18. The BBFC was formed in 1912 and, until 1984, was called the British Board of Film Censors. Although as Sarah Peacock points out sternly: \u201cWe are not censors. We are enablers. We believe adults should be free to choose their own material. We will only intervene if material is in breach of UK legislation.\u201d Peacock, my guide for the day, is in charge of the compliance officers \u2013 the people who watch films and classify them as U, PG, 12, 12A (suitable for children younger than 12 if accompanied by an adult), 15, 18 and R18 (adult works for licensed premises only). They very occasionally refuse to classify them at all \u2013 the last time that happened was in 2012 for a horror movie called Hate Crime about a group of neo-Nazis breaking into a Jewish family\u2019s home. The classifiers\u2019 job has changed hugely over the years. Initially they simply rated films for theatrical release. Then came trailers, TV shows, videos, DVDs and streaming services. \u201cNowadays Netflix is our biggest customer,\u201d says Peacock. She takes me on a tour of the rabbit warren. We head towards the cinema where staff monitor films for theatrical release. It could pass for a bijou repertory cinema. The compliance officer is sitting at the back with his laptop and a translator, watching a south Asian family film. This movie isn\u2019t going to cause him any problems. Astonishingly, the BBFC only has nine full-time compliance officers to oversee all the material it rates. Last year, with the help of Peacock and five freelancers, they classified 1,036 cinema films, 1,143 cinema trailers, 139 cinema advertisements, 4,266 video submissions, 4,630 online submissions, 52 music videos and 295 video trailers. Most of the BBFC\u2019s staff are film buffs. Peacock has a degree in film studies. On the floor above are a series of tiny offices where compliance staff watch material made for TV on their computers. \u201cThey are rather small,\u201d says Peacock. \u201cI lived in one of these for three and a bit years.\u201d One officer is clearly obsessed with Julie Christie, while another has a poster of The Graduate on the wall, featuring a young Dustin Hoffman, the half-stockinged leg of Anne Bancroft and the speech bubble: \u201cMrs Robinson, you\u2019re trying to seduce me \u2026 aren\u2019t you?\u201d When first released, the film was rated X (which meant 16 and over in the 1960s) because of its risque content \u2013 Hoffman\u2019s young man has an affair with Bancroft\u2019s middle-aged wife. In 2017 it was reclassified 12A. Back in Peacock\u2019s office, she tells me about a recent survey in which 10,000 people were asked about what they found offensive \u2013 a study that resulted in new guidelines being implemented earlier this year. \u201cThe public are generally more accepting of the use of the F-word and occasional uses of the C-word.\u201d Is she normally so reserved when it comes to her Fs and Cs? She smiles. \u201cNo. We say the actual words. I\u2019m being polite for you.\u201d There are, of course, still spats about language. In 2012 director Ken Loach and scriptwriter Paul Laverty were appalled that they had to restrict themselves to seven uses of the word \u201ccunt\u201d in order for The Angels\u2019 Share to get a 15 rating. Laverty argued: \u201c\u2018You wee cunt\u2019 is often a term of endearment \u2026 There are many films they have given a 15 certificate that I think are full of pornographic violence or racism or cruelty that is not fit for 15-year-olds. I think there is tremendous hypocrisy.\u201d The more liberal attitude towards sex is not just a recent thing. It\u2019s 19 years since the occult thriller Don\u2019t Look Now was downgraded to 15. But when the film was released in 1973, there was much debate about whether its stars Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland were really having sex in one erotic and desperately moving scene. That\u2019s a far cry from today, when an erection is not necessarily a no-no in non-adult cinema. \u201cThere are examples where we\u2019ve passed erections at 15,\u201d Peacock says. Genuine erections? \u201cI would imagine they were prosthetic. The Melissa McCarthy film Spy features a scene in which an erection is briefly seen on a smartphone screen. We consulted on that issue and the public told us that if they are brief and they occur in a comic context, and its not intended to arouse or titillate, then there might be leniency for that at 15.\u201d But classification is not an exact science \u2013 one viewer\u2019s amusement may be another\u2019s arousal. As for nudity in general, the BBFC has no restrictions so long as it is in a \u201cnatural context\u201d. So what have we become less tolerant of? Sexual violence and discrimination, Peacock says. \u201cTeenagers are particularly supportive of [us] being more restrictive on sexual violence. The idea that they don\u2019t care about what they\u2019re watching is a myth.\u201d In the BBFC\u2019s consultation, young people felt the scenes of sexual violence and suicide in the Netflix series 13 Reasons Why were correctly placed at 18. (This week, Netflix cut the suicide scene altogether.) Sexual violence is a broad category \u2013 covering harassment, assault and rape \u2013 and this year the BBFC has made it a distinct category for the first time. \u201cSexual violence was previously in with violence, now we\u2019ve separated it out,\u201d says Peacock. Horror is also an increasingly delicate area. \u201cWe are more sensitive to the idea of psychological threat and the impact this has on the viewer. We tend to be a bit more restrictive than our American counterpart when it comes to horror. A lot of films here get a 15 here whereas in the States they might get a PG-13.\u201d As for discrimination, the BBFC is now reclassifying some old classics in light of changing attitudes. The Dam Busters, for instance, was recently upgraded from a U to PG. \u201cOne of the contributing factors that took it up to PG was the name of their dog \u2013 it\u2019s called the N-word. We have a case study on our website explaining why the rating changed. The public explicitly told us to be more restrictive on depictions of discrimination.\u201d It\u2019s time to head off to another hidden annex of the BBFC. Peacock is showing me the fun side of the job \u2013 the BBFC\u2019s monthly(ish) podcast she regularly participates in along with other staff members. Today they are discussing the romcom. \u201cIt Happened One Night is one of my favourite screwball comedies,\u201d she tells listeners. \u201cClaudette Colbert plays a pampered socialite who falls in love with the roguish reporter played by Clark Gable. It was originally classified A [more suitable for adults] and when it was resubmitted in 1986 it went down to a U.\u201d On my way out, I ask if it\u2019s true that there are frequency limits for expletives in different classifications.

European brown bears, thought to have become extinct in the British wilds in medieval times, and grey wolves \u2013 which roamed free until the 17th century \u2013 are to coexist in a project called Bear Wood near Bristol. The idea of the scheme \u2013 which is part of Bristol Zoological Society\u2019s Wild Place Project \u2013 is to give visitors a glimpse into life in the woods and forests that used to cover much of the UK.

In 2018 Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld disappeared as a result.</p>\n    <p>In terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. The likes of Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>At the same time, there is a move away from buying \u2018stuff\u2019 as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What help do retailers need?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Retailers with a high-street presence want the government to change business rates. They also want more political certainty as the potential for a no deal Brexit means some are not only incurring additional costs for stockpiling goods but are unsure about the impact of tariffs after October 2019. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges which they say put off shoppers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the government doing?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In the October 2018 budget the government announced&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/26/budget-to-offer-business-rates-relief-for-small-shops\">some relief</a>&nbsp;on business rates for independent shopkeepers. It has also set up a \u00a3675m \u2018future high streets\u2019 fund under which local councils can bid for up to \u00a325m towards regeneration projects such as refurbishing local historic buildings and improving transport links. The fund will also pay for the creation of a high street taskforce to provide expertise and hands-on support to local areas.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the outlook in 2019?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Some retailers could go under. Weakened by a difficult Christmas \u2013 which accounts for the entire annual profits of many retailers, and with further Brexit wobbles to come \u2013 retailers are facing a tough 2019. Another rise in the national minimum wage in April and the falling value of the pound against the dollar, which is used to buy goods in the far east, have also added to costs and hit profits.</p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The former billionaire\u2019s retail empire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/12/philip-green-arcadia-avoids-administration-as-rescue-deal-backed\">staved off collapse last month</a> after winning the backing of creditors for a rescue plan that involves the closure of 50 of its 570 stores and 1,000 job losses.</p> \n<p>The plan involved seven company voluntary arrangements (CVAs), which are insolvency procedures that have been used to shut stores by a growing number of high-street retailers, including New Look, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/09/debenhams-wins-green-light-for-restructuring-plan\">Debenhams</a> and Mothercare.</p> \n<p>Ian Grabiner, the chief executive of Arcadia Group, said: \u201cThese challenges are entirely without merit and we will vigorously defend them.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe CVAs are a vital part of our restructuring, putting the business on a firm financial footing and enabling significant investment as part of our growth plans which will ultimately benefit all our stakeholders.

      "body": "<p>Conservatives shouldn\u2019t view Boris Johnson\u2019s time as mayor of London as a road map to winning in a hostile electoral environment. Instead it is a cautionary tale for how he might lead the country. I was leader of Camden council for all of Johnson\u2019s second term and have seen up close how he behaves with executive power. It would be easy to dismiss me as a Labour stalwart taking potshots at the likely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/16/brexit-weekly-briefing-tories-back-johnson-despite-mistakes\" title=\"\">next Conservative prime minister</a>, but Tory MPs could do worse than talk to those among their ranks who have worked closely with him. It is notable how few of them back his leadership bid.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As mayor, Johnson was happy to give planning permission for housing only accessible to those on six-figure salaries</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>London\u2019s borough leaders have many different relationships with the mayor, which means they get to see them close up, in a variety of ways. The most important aspect of Johnson\u2019s working style is his lack of attention to detail. In every setting, from one-to-one meetings to big set pieces, such as the annual London government dinner, he would be ill-prepared. This comes across as disinterest or worse. But this isn\u2019t a problem of his manner or working style. Those who worked as his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/26/boris-johnson-hires-mark-fullbrook-as-campaign-chief-lynton-crosby\" title=\"\">closest advisers</a> in City Hall are quite open about the fact that Johnson would lose interest if a policy briefing took more than a few minutes, five maximum. In some settings this really doesn\u2019t matter, and every politician is ill-prepared from time to time. But Johnson is the only one I\u2019ve met for whom it\u2019s a modus operandi.</p> <p>This lack of attention feeds through to how he governs. In 2014-15 the London budget was actually signed by his chief of staff, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davehillblog/2011/jun/08/boris-johnson-edward-lister-thatcherite-conservatism\" title=\"\">Eddie Lister</a>, and had a handwritten note attached saying \u201c<a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/gla_migrate_files_destination/MD1319%20Final%202014-15%20Council%20Tax%20%20Precept%20and%20leaflet%20%28signed%29%20PDF.pdf\" title=\"\">shown to the mayor and approved</a>\u201d. Only Johnson knows for sure, but I doubt I\u2019m the only one who sees that note and questions the degree of attention the mayor actually gave to the capital\u2019s budget. No wonder Lister was frequently referred to by Johnson detractors and supporters alike as the real mayor of London.</p> <p>Work frequently isn\u2019t followed through. I saw this at first hand sitting on the London Health Board, which Johnson chaired. In 2014 a report, complete with a foreword written by Johnson, showed the <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/gla_migrate_files_destination/Mental%20health%20report.pdf\" title=\"\">costs to London of poor mental health</a> in the capital \u2013 \u00a326bn per year. The report was left on the shelf. Embarrassingly for Johnson, New York\u2019s city government did think London\u2019s research was useful, and developed a citywide approach to improving mental health. It wasn\u2019t until Sadiq Khan took up the reins at City Hall that the poor mental health of Londoners was taken seriously.</p> <p>In practical terms it\u2019s not clear that Johnson is the one-nation Tory he is now claiming to be. His recent proposals to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/10/boris-johnson-promise-tax-cut-raise-40p-threshold\" title=\"\">raise the higher rate tax band</a> \u2013 giving a massive tax cut to people earning way above average salaries \u2013 was presaged in his approach in London. In housing, Johnson was determined to deliver as little as possible for those on more modest incomes. In Camden and Islington, a large former Royal Mail site was given planning permission with just <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-29475191\" title=\"\">14% of units at affordable rents</a> when economic analysis showed the site could support <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/oct/02/boris-johnson-approve-affordable-london-flats-rent\" title=\"\">50%</a>. This isn\u2019t just housing for the poorest but also the intermediate housing that London\u2019s economy desperately needs. But Johnson was happy to give planning permission for housing only accessible to those on six-figure salaries and above.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/16/boris-johnson-tax-cuts-tory-leadership-laffer-curve\">Boris Johnson says tax cuts bring in revenue.

      "bodyText": "Conservatives shouldn\u2019t view Boris Johnson\u2019s time as mayor of London as a road map to winning in a hostile electoral environment. Instead it is a cautionary tale for how he might lead the country. I was leader of Camden council for all of Johnson\u2019s second term and have seen up close how he behaves with executive power. It would be easy to dismiss me as a Labour stalwart taking potshots at the likely next Conservative prime minister, but Tory MPs could do worse than talk to those among their ranks who have worked closely with him. It is notable how few of them back his leadership bid. London\u2019s borough leaders have many different relationships with the mayor, which means they get to see them close up, in a variety of ways. The most important aspect of Johnson\u2019s working style is his lack of attention to detail. In every setting, from one-to-one meetings to big set pieces, such as the annual London government dinner, he would be ill-prepared. This comes across as disinterest or worse. But this isn\u2019t a problem of his manner or working style. Those who worked as his closest advisers in City Hall are quite open about the fact that Johnson would lose interest if a policy briefing took more than a few minutes, five maximum. In some settings this really doesn\u2019t matter, and every politician is ill-prepared from time to time. But Johnson is the only one I\u2019ve met for whom it\u2019s a modus operandi. This lack of attention feeds through to how he governs. In 2014-15 the London budget was actually signed by his chief of staff, Eddie Lister, and had a handwritten note attached saying \u201cshown to the mayor and approved\u201d. Only Johnson knows for sure, but I doubt I\u2019m the only one who sees that note and questions the degree of attention the mayor actually gave to the capital\u2019s budget. No wonder Lister was frequently referred to by Johnson detractors and supporters alike as the real mayor of London. Work frequently isn\u2019t followed through. I saw this at first hand sitting on the London Health Board, which Johnson chaired. In 2014 a report, complete with a foreword written by Johnson, showed the costs to London of poor mental health in the capital \u2013 \u00a326bn per year. The report was left on the shelf. Embarrassingly for Johnson, New York\u2019s city government did think London\u2019s research was useful, and developed a citywide approach to improving mental health. It wasn\u2019t until Sadiq Khan took up the reins at City Hall that the poor mental health of Londoners was taken seriously. In practical terms it\u2019s not clear that Johnson is the one-nation Tory he is now claiming to be. His recent proposals to raise the higher rate tax band \u2013 giving a massive tax cut to people earning way above average salaries \u2013 was presaged in his approach in London. In housing, Johnson was determined to deliver as little as possible for those on more modest incomes. In Camden and Islington, a large former Royal Mail site was given planning permission with just 14% of units at affordable rents when economic analysis showed the site could support 50%. This isn\u2019t just housing for the poorest but also the intermediate housing that London\u2019s economy desperately needs. But Johnson was happy to give planning permission for housing only accessible to those on six-figure salaries and above. In order to get away with this Johnson also used his planning powers to try to define \u201caffordable\u201d in London as 80% of the market price for housing. This was well beyond the reach of people leaving home for the first time and, in places such as Camden, beyond even relatively settled middle management in both the public and private sectors. This led to a catastrophic loss of trust from voters about what was affordable and to this day, when you talk to Londoners about affordable housing, they normally ask: \u201cAffordable for whom?\u201d Tories may not be that sympathetic to this complaint, but maybe they should ask Labour about how incredibly harmful policy ambiguity can be in the long term. Certainly, in London this attack on Johnson writes itself. Who leads the Tories is a matter for the party\u2019s MPs and members. Who leads the country should concern us all. Those who have seen Johnson up close in power worry about his suitability for high office. This is not a party political point: while I would fundamentally disagree with Sajid Javid, or Jeremy Hunt, or Rory Stewart, I can see the case for them leading the country. The challenges, first of Brexit and then of the huge domestic conundrums we face \u2013 housing, adult social care, post-Brexit industrial and trade policy \u2013 all require attention to detail, hard work and tough choices.

I am quite curvy, so I like wearing clothes that show that off, but I am a bit of a scruff away from work and the red carpet.

      "bodyText": "I never usually get to wear anything like this. I was playing an ATS (Auxiliary Territorial Service) girl in the 2016 film adaptation of Dad\u2019s Army and wearing their classic uniform with a nice blonde wig \u2013 it was really fun. With a film like that, there\u2019s always so much pressure on the costume designers to get it right and be respectful. The work that goes into it is unbelievable. There was this pair of khaki trousers with a light-green shirt tucked in, covered by a khaki jacket that matched the trousers. I had to have the particular socks that they wore, and these massive big, blokey boots. You couldn\u2019t wear the hat any old way; it had to be at a certain tilt. I am so used to wearing skimpy little skirts and being dressed up like a doll, so it was actually really nice to dress in something so comfortable. It might be a little bit less flattering, but it was nice and warm \u2013 and I was quite grateful for it because it was freezing on set. Usually, I like to keep on top of the trends but without being too \u201cout there\u201d \u2013 I play it fairly safe when it comes to fashion. I am quite curvy, so I like wearing clothes that show that off, but I am a bit of a scruff away from work and the red carpet. I always say to myself: \u201cI\u2019m going to go for a vintage look now. I\u2019m going to put a headscarf on and wear red lipstick all the time.\u201d But I\u2019m too lazy. I always revert back to being comfy. I was really fretting about being bare-faced when I went on I\u2019m A Celebrity \u2026 I thought you were allowed to take at least one item of makeup in there, but you\u2019re just not. When I learned that, I thought: \u201cRight, I either have a full breakdown about it or I just embrace it, get my freckles out and enjoy my time in the jungle.\u201d I had to leave all my insecurities at the door, and I did. Something like that really exposes you, but it made me realise I am more comfortable in my own skin than I thought I was. Emily Atack: Adulting is on Wednesdays at 10pm on W",

But more importantly, to me at least, it was a) the first away shirt I ever owned and b) the shirt Sheffield United wore as they stormed to promotion to the old First Division in 1990, which was achieved via a 5-2 win against Leicester City at Filbert Street on the final day of that season. They also wore it the following season, their first campaign in the top flight since the mid-70s.

On Sunday, Johnson used his <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/07/14/can-improve-mental-health-save-money-boost-economy-one-go/\" title=\"\">Telegraph column</a> to share his brilliant solution to Britain\u2019s mental health crisis: drown out your inner demons with work. Yep, according to the sentient shock of hair that will probably be Britain\u2019s next prime minister, you can rid yourself of depression by working harder.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s views on mental health largely seem to be influenced by that famous wellness guru, Winston Churchill. \u201cIt was with work that [Churchill] pitchforked off his depression,\u201d BJ informs us in his column. \u201c[A]nd what was true for Churchill is basically true for all of us: that to a very large extent we \u2018derive our self-esteem from what we do\u2019. It is often from our jobs \u2026 that we get that all-important sense of satisfaction.\u201d</p> <p>This isn\u2019t entirely false; many of us derive structure and purpose from work. Many of us are just like Churchill! However, positioning work as the cure for mental health problems is mind-bogglingly reductive. \u201cPull yourself together\u201d is what Johnson\u2019s basically saying. Buck up. Shake yourself out of it. But depression, of course, isn\u2019t something you can simply shake off. It is not a bad mood. It is not a head cold.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is quite the renaissance man. He builds buses! He writes columns! He dabbles in politics! And now, it would appear, he fancies himself a mental health expert. On Sunday, Johnson used his Telegraph column to share his brilliant solution to Britain\u2019s mental health crisis: drown out your inner demons with work. Yep, according to the sentient shock of hair that will probably be Britain\u2019s next prime minister, you can rid yourself of depression by working harder. Johnson\u2019s views on mental health largely seem to be influenced by that famous wellness guru, Winston Churchill. \u201cIt was with work that [Churchill] pitchforked off his depression,\u201d BJ informs us in his column. \u201c[A]nd what was true for Churchill is basically true for all of us: that to a very large extent we \u2018derive our self-esteem from what we do\u2019. It is often from our jobs \u2026 that we get that all-important sense of satisfaction.\u201d This isn\u2019t entirely false; many of us derive structure and purpose from work. Many of us are just like Churchill! However, positioning work as the cure for mental health problems is mind-bogglingly reductive. \u201cPull yourself together\u201d is what Johnson\u2019s basically saying. Buck up. Shake yourself out of it. But depression, of course, isn\u2019t something you can simply shake off. It is not a bad mood. It is not a head cold. Losing yourself in work might help you feel better temporarily, but it is not exactly a solution to mental health issues. It is also unhelpful, I think, to perpetuate the idea that we should \u201cderive our self-esteem from what we do\u201d. There is nothing wrong with being too ill to work. There is nothing wrong with doing nothing. And yet most of us have internalised the toxic notion that we should value ourselves according to our output. The pressure to constantly feel that we are being productive, to work non stop, is one reason so many of us feel perpetually burned out. Conservatives think that work is the answer to everything because it allows them to put all responsibility, all blame, on individuals rather the system. Too poor to buy food? Just work harder! What do you mean you\u2019re already working hard? Just pull yourself up by your bootstraps and work harder. Too depressed to get out of bed? Work harder. It\u2019ll do you good!

      "body": "<p>\u201cNothing belongs to us any more; they have taken away our clothes, our shoes, even our hair; if we speak, they will not listen to us, and if they listen, they will not understand. They will even take away our name: and if we want to keep it, we will have to find our strength to do so, to manage somehow so that behind the name something of us, of us as we were, still remains.\u201d</p> <p>So Primo Levi describes the beginning of the process of \u201cthe demolition of a man\u201d, the \u201coffence\u201d that Auschwitz inflicted on so many people. \u201cH\u00e4ftling,\u201d he writes in If This Is a Man, using the German word for prisoner, \u201cI have learned that I am a H\u00e4ftling. My name is 174517.\u201d</p> <p>Throughout If This Is a Man, Levi reiterates that survival was mainly a matter of random events, coincidences and fortune. But it also required stubborn resistance. As Levi explains an afterword, he remained \u201cdetermined to recognise always, even in the darkest days, in my companions and in myself, men, not things.\u201d</p> <p>Levi holds on to this humanity until the camp is liberated. But he has been hollowed out by hunger, toil and unremitting horror. His sense of self has been undermined by mental and bodily weakness and the moral compromises needed for survival. If This Is a Man finishes with Levi in a kind of perilous limbo. He hasn\u2019t \u201cdrowned\u201d, as he terms it, but nor does he show us much about salvation. The last pages are strange and abrupt. The Russians arrive as Levi and a companion \u2013 Charles \u2013 are carrying a corpse outside their hut. They tip over the stretcher. Charles takes off his beret; Levi regrets he doesn\u2019t have one too. We get a hint that Levi has resumed life, because he tells us he\u2019s been writing letters to other survivors. And that\u2019s it.</p> <p>It\u2019s in the sequel The Truce that Levi tells us how he rebuilt his humanity after it was demolished in Auschwitz. It\u2019s a long climb into the light and \u2013 remarkably \u2013 it\u2019s frequently beautiful. More than that, it\u2019s funny.</p> <p>The book tells of Levi\u2019s final days in the camp in southern Poland before his eventual return home to Turin, via numerous extended detours and meanderings through Soviet Russia, Rumania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Austria. It is a long, \u201cludicrous journey\u201d, as Philip Toynbee described it in the Observer when the book first came out in English in 1965: \u201ca poem in honour of human wit and endurance\u201d.</p> <p>The Truce is full of wonder. Early on, for instance, Levi crashes down to sleep in a telegraph hut by a railway line. When he wakes, the telegraphist sees him raise his head and places \u201can enormous slice of bread and cheese\u201d beside him. After Levi\u2019s descriptions of the scarcity and brutality of Auschwitz, this abundant generosity feels special. But it\u2019s what comes next that is most miraculous. \u201cI was startled,\u201d Levi writes, \u201cand I fear I did not thank him.\u201d</p> <p>That he should worry about such a small courtesy \u2013 and be in a position where it could even occur to him - feels like an early victory for his strengthening sense of humanity. And it keeps on getting better from there. Soon, Levi is providing comical descriptions of a \u201csurly\u201d Greek who berates him for having no shoes, who knows \u201chow to work all the skives in the world\u201d and who manages to charm a barracks full of Italian soldiers: \u201cHe possessed the right equipment; he could speak Italian, and (what matters more and what is missing in many Italians themselves) he knew of what to speak in Italian.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a delight to encounter such light-hearted jokes in The Truce after the miseries of If This Is a Man. In the latter, there was the numbing, frightening sense that Levi had no choice but to scour his surroundings for every detail that could change his ability to survive. In The Truce, we see a new curiosity awakening as Levi delights in his surroundings.</p> <p>The Truce even takes on a picaresque quality, with its hero providing a rich variety of wry character sketches and fascinated depictions of lands and peoples. But there are also harsh jolts of reality: many nights spent in stalled railway carriages, forced break-ins to ramshackle refugee camps, numerous uncertainties and dangers.</p> <p>And there\u2019s the shadow of Auschwitz. Sometimes Levi reminds us of the camp to show us how its cruel systems have disappeared. Barbed wire fences have holes. The soldiers he encounters are drunk, asleep or cheerily helpful. The ruthless efficiency of the kapos and SS has been replaced by local bureaucracies that are confused, slapdash, unpredictable. Crucially, this time, the train takes him away and out of danger. Levi is no longer a h\u00e4ftling. There is plenty of himself that remains and plenty that he has regained. He has clothes, shoes, a name.</p> <p>But a profound darkness hangs over the book. Levi reminds us at the end that he is one of only three making this journey away from Auschwitz; when he was sent there, he was one among 650. In the last pages he recounts a terrifying recurring dream within a dream, in which his new, light-filled life is a dream he is having in the camp. The final word in the book is chilling. It is the \u201cdawn command\u201d to get up: \u201cWstaw\u00e0ch.\u201d For all the joy in The Truce, Auschwitz is never far away.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cNothing belongs to us any more; they have taken away our clothes, our shoes, even our hair; if we speak, they will not listen to us, and if they listen, they will not understand. They will even take away our name: and if we want to keep it, we will have to find our strength to do so, to manage somehow so that behind the name something of us, of us as we were, still remains.\u201d So Primo Levi describes the beginning of the process of \u201cthe demolition of a man\u201d, the \u201coffence\u201d that Auschwitz inflicted on so many people. \u201cH\u00e4ftling,\u201d he writes in If This Is a Man, using the German word for prisoner, \u201cI have learned that I am a H\u00e4ftling. My name is 174517.\u201d Throughout If This Is a Man, Levi reiterates that survival was mainly a matter of random events, coincidences and fortune. But it also required stubborn resistance. As Levi explains an afterword, he remained \u201cdetermined to recognise always, even in the darkest days, in my companions and in myself, men, not things.\u201d Levi holds on to this humanity until the camp is liberated. But he has been hollowed out by hunger, toil and unremitting horror. His sense of self has been undermined by mental and bodily weakness and the moral compromises needed for survival. If This Is a Man finishes with Levi in a kind of perilous limbo. He hasn\u2019t \u201cdrowned\u201d, as he terms it, but nor does he show us much about salvation. The last pages are strange and abrupt. The Russians arrive as Levi and a companion \u2013 Charles \u2013 are carrying a corpse outside their hut. They tip over the stretcher. Charles takes off his beret; Levi regrets he doesn\u2019t have one too. We get a hint that Levi has resumed life, because he tells us he\u2019s been writing letters to other survivors. And that\u2019s it. It\u2019s in the sequel The Truce that Levi tells us how he rebuilt his humanity after it was demolished in Auschwitz. It\u2019s a long climb into the light and \u2013 remarkably \u2013 it\u2019s frequently beautiful. More than that, it\u2019s funny. The book tells of Levi\u2019s final days in the camp in southern Poland before his eventual return home to Turin, via numerous extended detours and meanderings through Soviet Russia, Rumania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Austria. It is a long, \u201cludicrous journey\u201d, as Philip Toynbee described it in the Observer when the book first came out in English in 1965: \u201ca poem in honour of human wit and endurance\u201d. The Truce is full of wonder. Early on, for instance, Levi crashes down to sleep in a telegraph hut by a railway line. When he wakes, the telegraphist sees him raise his head and places \u201can enormous slice of bread and cheese\u201d beside him. After Levi\u2019s descriptions of the scarcity and brutality of Auschwitz, this abundant generosity feels special. But it\u2019s what comes next that is most miraculous. \u201cI was startled,\u201d Levi writes, \u201cand I fear I did not thank him.\u201d That he should worry about such a small courtesy \u2013 and be in a position where it could even occur to him - feels like an early victory for his strengthening sense of humanity. And it keeps on getting better from there. Soon, Levi is providing comical descriptions of a \u201csurly\u201d Greek who berates him for having no shoes, who knows \u201chow to work all the skives in the world\u201d and who manages to charm a barracks full of Italian soldiers: \u201cHe possessed the right equipment; he could speak Italian, and (what matters more and what is missing in many Italians themselves) he knew of what to speak in Italian.\u201d It\u2019s a delight to encounter such light-hearted jokes in The Truce after the miseries of If This Is a Man. In the latter, there was the numbing, frightening sense that Levi had no choice but to scour his surroundings for every detail that could change his ability to survive. In The Truce, we see a new curiosity awakening as Levi delights in his surroundings. The Truce even takes on a picaresque quality, with its hero providing a rich variety of wry character sketches and fascinated depictions of lands and peoples. But there are also harsh jolts of reality: many nights spent in stalled railway carriages, forced break-ins to ramshackle refugee camps, numerous uncertainties and dangers. And there\u2019s the shadow of Auschwitz. Sometimes Levi reminds us of the camp to show us how its cruel systems have disappeared. Barbed wire fences have holes. The soldiers he encounters are drunk, asleep or cheerily helpful. The ruthless efficiency of the kapos and SS has been replaced by local bureaucracies that are confused, slapdash, unpredictable. Crucially, this time, the train takes him away and out of danger. Levi is no longer a h\u00e4ftling. There is plenty of himself that remains and plenty that he has regained. He has clothes, shoes, a name. But a profound darkness hangs over the book. Levi reminds us at the end that he is one of only three making this journey away from Auschwitz; when he was sent there, he was one among 650. In the last pages he recounts a terrifying recurring dream within a dream, in which his new, light-filled life is a dream he is having in the camp. The final word in the book is chilling. It is the \u201cdawn command\u201d to get up: \u201cWstaw\u00e0ch.\u201d For all the joy in The Truce, Auschwitz is never far away.",

      "body": "<h2>England: champions</h2> <p>England\u2019s run to the semi-finals, and indeed final, could not have been more quintessentially English. The team came into the tournament on a great run and hope was lifted to even greater heights with a few high-quality performances, only to be met with a crash back to traditional English cynicism when we almost inevitably lost to two tournament underdogs. From this point on though, they were exceptional, rising to the challenge of what essentially became four consecutive knockout games.</p> <p>What else can be said about the final? It was the best game of cricket I\u2019ve witnessed and quite possibly the best of all time. The match had it all and England finally proved that they can stand up in those pressure moments in a knockout tournament. They had no small degree of luck and there was plenty of tension, but how else would you want to win your first Cricket World Cup?</p> <p>Let\u2019s hope this group stays together for one more World Cup under the cool head of Eoin Morgan and a coach who will further develop this exciting brand of cricket. It would be easy to see this as the pinnacle, but how incredible would it be to push for an Australia-esque World Cup dynasty? <em><strong>Matt Leech</strong></em></p> <h2>New Zealand: finalists</h2> <p>We delivered the greatest of World Cup finals. No other countries would have produced such a game. New Zealand always get stuck into games and regularly deliver some of the greatest cricketing spectacles. It\u2019s such a shame we remain financially uninteresting for cricketing schedulers. Winning the World Cup might have changed that, but we are worthy runners-up.</p> <p>Jimmy Neesham was my player of the tournament. He plays hard and fearless, keeps going and has a mental toughness and mature outlook on life. He will have plenty of big moments in his career. <em><strong>Malcolm Eddington</strong></em></p> <h2>India: semi-finalists</h2> <p>India were like a critically acclaimed television show. After power-packed leading performances from neo-noir legend Rohit Sharma and the experimental yet highly engaging directorship from Jasprit Bumrah, most expected that pair, along with a strong supporting cast, to help India execute a stunning finale. But, despite bringing in the biggest viewing figures, the show was cancelled at the last moment by the executives at the World Cup \u2013 the notorious Kiwis.</p> <p>MS Dhoni was a fan favourite, but his personal style did not suit the overall tone of the crew. Rishabh Pant, a cult hero on the local soap opera, Indian Premier League, wasn\u2019t ready for the biggest stage just yet.

      "bodyText": "England: champions England\u2019s run to the semi-finals, and indeed final, could not have been more quintessentially English. The team came into the tournament on a great run and hope was lifted to even greater heights with a few high-quality performances, only to be met with a crash back to traditional English cynicism when we almost inevitably lost to two tournament underdogs. From this point on though, they were exceptional, rising to the challenge of what essentially became four consecutive knockout games. What else can be said about the final? It was the best game of cricket I\u2019ve witnessed and quite possibly the best of all time. The match had it all and England finally proved that they can stand up in those pressure moments in a knockout tournament. They had no small degree of luck and there was plenty of tension, but how else would you want to win your first Cricket World Cup? Let\u2019s hope this group stays together for one more World Cup under the cool head of Eoin Morgan and a coach who will further develop this exciting brand of cricket. It would be easy to see this as the pinnacle, but how incredible would it be to push for an Australia-esque World Cup dynasty? Matt Leech New Zealand: finalists We delivered the greatest of World Cup finals. No other countries would have produced such a game. New Zealand always get stuck into games and regularly deliver some of the greatest cricketing spectacles. It\u2019s such a shame we remain financially uninteresting for cricketing schedulers. Winning the World Cup might have changed that, but we are worthy runners-up. Jimmy Neesham was my player of the tournament. He plays hard and fearless, keeps going and has a mental toughness and mature outlook on life. He will have plenty of big moments in his career. Malcolm Eddington India: semi-finalists India were like a critically acclaimed television show. After power-packed leading performances from neo-noir legend Rohit Sharma and the experimental yet highly engaging directorship from Jasprit Bumrah, most expected that pair, along with a strong supporting cast, to help India execute a stunning finale. But, despite bringing in the biggest viewing figures, the show was cancelled at the last moment by the executives at the World Cup \u2013 the notorious Kiwis. MS Dhoni was a fan favourite, but his personal style did not suit the overall tone of the crew. Rishabh Pant, a cult hero on the local soap opera, Indian Premier League, wasn\u2019t ready for the biggest stage just yet. Surely, by the time the next big show comes around, he will be in the spotlight. Scriptwriter Virat Kohli was excellent but still did not meet his lofty standards and fluffed the ending. Cameos from Sir Ravindra Jadeja grabbed bits and pieces of the public imagination and an unexpected starring role during India\u2019s final moments justified calls for his regular introduction to the set-up in the future.

Thankfully medicine has moved on from the days when Jews were blamed for outbreaks of the plague across medieval Europe, yet with psychiatric illnesses something of the old accusatory myths seem to linger. Until relatively recently, autism was still wrongly blamed on so-called \u201crefrigerator mothers\u201d, who supposedly damaged their children by being cold and unloving. The discovery that <a href=\"https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/more-autism-genes-identified-64957\" title=\"\">autism has a genetic component </a>turned our understanding of the role it plays in families upside down, and now something similar may be happening with anorexia.</p> <p>New research on DNA samples from thousands of anorexics has found a link to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jul/15/anorexia-not-just-a-psychiatric-problem-scientists-find\" title=\"\">genes involved in regulating metabolism</a>, as well as those connected with anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorders. The deadly compulsion to starve yourself, to put it crudely, is not all in the mind but also has something to do with the way the body processes food. That may not necessarily come as an enormous surprise to doctors \u2013 it\u2019s not the first time research has linked eating disorders to a broken metabolism \u2013 but it\u2019s potentially a breakthrough in how broader society views those who suffer from it, and perhaps how they see themselves.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/15/age-of-obesity-shaming-overweight-people\">We\u2019re in a\u00a0new age of obesity.

      "bodyText": "Once upon a time, disease was thought to have been sent by God as a punishment for sin. If not, then it must surely be the work of demons, witches or groups regarded as social outcasts. Thankfully medicine has moved on from the days when Jews were blamed for outbreaks of the plague across medieval Europe, yet with psychiatric illnesses something of the old accusatory myths seem to linger. Until relatively recently, autism was still wrongly blamed on so-called \u201crefrigerator mothers\u201d, who supposedly damaged their children by being cold and unloving. The discovery that autism has a genetic component turned our understanding of the role it plays in families upside down, and now something similar may be happening with anorexia. New research on DNA samples from thousands of anorexics has found a link to genes involved in regulating metabolism, as well as those connected with anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorders. The deadly compulsion to starve yourself, to put it crudely, is not all in the mind but also has something to do with the way the body processes food. That may not necessarily come as an enormous surprise to doctors \u2013 it\u2019s not the first time research has linked eating disorders to a broken metabolism \u2013 but it\u2019s potentially a breakthrough in how broader society views those who suffer from it, and perhaps how they see themselves.

The fantasy lives \u2013 just \u2013 but must now inhabit a lever-arch file outlining everything the UK still doesn\u2019t understand about global trade.</p> <p>In recent weeks, dyed-in-the-wool Brexiter Fox has warned against no deal, explained <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/26/liam-fox-tilting-at-windmills-boris-johnson-tariffs-say-tory-eurosceptics\" title=\"\">why Boris Johnson cannot use Gatt article 24</a> to unilaterally implement a deal with the EU, and pointed out that we cannot negotiate a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/15/post-brexit-trade-pact-with-us-may-take-some-time-says-liam-fox\" title=\"\">new package with the US</a> before Brexit has taken place. The reason for his newfound pragmatism was perhaps revealed by Monday\u2019s announcement that the government is seeking to train <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-48943551\" title=\"\">12 new professional trade negotiators</a>, and Fox\u2019s declaration that trade should be <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/07/14/trade-should-taught-national-curriculum-liam-fox-mp-says/\" title=\"\">taught on the national curriculum</a>. So there we have it: the government has discovered that trade depends on rules, and almost nobody in Britain knows what they are.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The government has discovered that trade depends on rules, and almost nobody in Britain knows what they are</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The UK\u2019s ongoing lack of preparedness for Brexit is not news. The revelation that we are only now training new negotiators merely highlights the slapdash incompetence the government has been showcasing since the Brexit vote. But the demand for better trade education was revealing, because it illuminates one of the key problems with Brexit: it depends not on dreams but facts.</p> <p>What, then, should we add to this new curriculum? The first lesson is that trade is not about taking back control. Indeed, the opposite is true. Unless you wish to force your goods and services on others, modern trade arrangements revolve around common laws and conventions. That champion of free-trade Brexiters, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/21/brexit-mark-carney-dismisses-boris-johnson-trade-claim-on-no-deal\" title=\"\">World Trade Organization</a>, is (unlike the EU) an unelected body that sets the basic rules of everyday commerce. Countries must, for example, set limits on tariffs and share quotas. Because discrimination is forbidden, the UK will have to apply its tariffs to all countries equally. These rules may be described as pooling sovereignty. Certainly, countries are free to organise trade deals in which they can eliminate tariffs altogether. These also require a legal agreement to prevent one country flouting shared rules or acting uncompetitively or unfairly, and this also limits sovereignty. If one member later \u201creasserts\u201d it, by pulling out of the agreement, it must face negative economic consequences.</p> <p>The second lesson is gravity. The flow of trade depends on both size and distance. The US and EU have similar GDPs, but we trade more with the EU because it is nearer. Indeed, our trade with individual EU countries is significantly greater than with many of the world\u2019s largest economies. Our <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_United_Kingdom\" title=\"\">volume of trade</a> with Ireland is more than 200% greater than that with India \u2013 110% more with Germany than China.</p> <p>The third lesson is that trade is about power, but the power you have now, not the one you remember. The EU as a bloc negotiates successful trade deals because it has the clout of more than 500 million consumers behind it and can afford to walk away from a deal rather than make overly painful compromises. Within the EU, power and resources also matter.

      "bodyText": "International trade secretary Liam Fox has shown us what happens when one of the leaders of the revolution spends three subsequent years looking at paperwork. The fantasy lives \u2013 just \u2013 but must now inhabit a lever-arch file outlining everything the UK still doesn\u2019t understand about global trade. In recent weeks, dyed-in-the-wool Brexiter Fox has warned against no deal, explained why Boris Johnson cannot use Gatt article 24 to unilaterally implement a deal with the EU, and pointed out that we cannot negotiate a new package with the US before Brexit has taken place. The reason for his newfound pragmatism was perhaps revealed by Monday\u2019s announcement that the government is seeking to train 12 new professional trade negotiators, and Fox\u2019s declaration that trade should be taught on the national curriculum. So there we have it: the government has discovered that trade depends on rules, and almost nobody in Britain knows what they are. The UK\u2019s ongoing lack of preparedness for Brexit is not news. The revelation that we are only now training new negotiators merely highlights the slapdash incompetence the government has been showcasing since the Brexit vote. But the demand for better trade education was revealing, because it illuminates one of the key problems with Brexit: it depends not on dreams but facts. What, then, should we add to this new curriculum? The first lesson is that trade is not about taking back control. Indeed, the opposite is true. Unless you wish to force your goods and services on others, modern trade arrangements revolve around common laws and conventions. That champion of free-trade Brexiters, the World Trade Organization, is (unlike the EU) an unelected body that sets the basic rules of everyday commerce. Countries must, for example, set limits on tariffs and share quotas. Because discrimination is forbidden, the UK will have to apply its tariffs to all countries equally. These rules may be described as pooling sovereignty. Certainly, countries are free to organise trade deals in which they can eliminate tariffs altogether. These also require a legal agreement to prevent one country flouting shared rules or acting uncompetitively or unfairly, and this also limits sovereignty. If one member later \u201creasserts\u201d it, by pulling out of the agreement, it must face negative economic consequences. The second lesson is gravity. The flow of trade depends on both size and distance. The US and EU have similar GDPs, but we trade more with the EU because it is nearer. Indeed, our trade with individual EU countries is significantly greater than with many of the world\u2019s largest economies. Our volume of trade with Ireland is more than 200% greater than that with India \u2013 110% more with Germany than China. The third lesson is that trade is about power, but the power you have now, not the one you remember. The EU as a bloc negotiates successful trade deals because it has the clout of more than 500 million consumers behind it and can afford to walk away from a deal rather than make overly painful compromises. Within the EU, power and resources also matter. Germany exports more to India, South Africa and Australia than we do, despite our Commonwealth and language ties, because it is larger, richer and produces more things that people want to buy \u2013 not because it imagines itself to be great or focuses on a mythologised history. The fourth lesson is that trade is about reciprocity, and listening to the concerns of your partners. If you show a willingness to compromise on things you want, engage in good faith and allow others to assert their interests, you may be able to agree deals more quickly. If, however, you simply arrive with a checklist (a single market in goods, for instance) without taking into account the other partner\u2019s wishes (upholding the basic principles of the EU and the Good Friday agreement, say), you may get stuck. Perhaps the most important lesson about trade is that there is more to life than trade. The UK\u2019s most basic error was to assume that its status and statistics would speak for themselves. But in the end it didn\u2019t matter that Britain was an important country, or that the EU had a trade surplus it wanted to preserve: Brussels still wasn\u2019t going to give us the benefits of EU membership without any of its obligations. The fabled German car manufacturers didn\u2019t, in the end, bail us out, because the EU is about more than mercantilism, commerce or a balance sheet. It is about the political cohesion of a group of nations which depends on shared rules, solidarity and trust. The British government thought it could trump the EU\u2019s laws and values with the promise of 65 million customers, and it was wrong. Fox\u2019s idea about education illuminates the truth: the Brexiters were never interested in trade, but the idea of trade. Our future will not depend on the imagination, but on the cold, unforgiving realities of power, leverage and skill. It is right that schoolchildren should learn about it \u2013 so should our next prime minister.

      "bodyText": "Dutch police unions have called for extra training in resisting approaches from criminal gangs after a report concluded that the recent firing of dozens of officers for corruption and security breaches could prove \u201cthe tip of the iceberg\u201d. The Algemeen Dagblad (AD) newspaper said the confidential police report confirmed suspicions that forces around the country were being infiltrated by organised crime, with 19 officers from the mid-Netherlands force alone found to have underworld connections. The paper said dozens of officers had been suspended or dismissed in recent weeks over offences and allegations of corruption in office, fraud, professional misconduct, breach of official secrecy, dereliction of duty and misuse of police computers. In Utrecht, a senior officer was sacked and faces court proceedings after being revealed by a crown witness to have been in the pay of Ridouan Taghi, a notorious suspected drugs baron currently on trial, with 15 accomplices, accused of organising a string of underworld killings. In the southern province of Limburg, another commanding officer and three more junior staff have been suspended for \u201csuspected unprofessional behaviour\u201d after an investigation into four police personnel who were taken off active duty in April. In Amsterdam, the paper said, a 55-year-old officer was suspended and arrested last week in the seventh such incident since May. Officers in the Dutch capital have been sacked or suspended for possession of hard drugs, forgery, tampering with official computers and divulging confidential information. The report said the series of recent sackings and suspensions was \u201cprobably the tip of the iceberg\u201d, with sources stressing that investigators have \u201ca large number of other live inquiries\u201d on which they cannot currently work due to lack of capacity. Jan Struijs, the chair of the police union NPD, told AD the police needed to do far more to improve officers\u2019 resistance to \u201csurreptitious\u201d overtures from organised crime, which take place \u201cat all levels\u201d of the profession. Cases of corruption \u201cincrease mutual suspicion among officers and that\u2019s really a big problem\u201d, Struijs said. \u201cOfficers must be able to trust each other blindly.\u201d He demanded urgent extra training. \u201cOfficers need to be taught how to deal with this in a proper and responsible manner,\u201d Struijs said. \u201cIf they are approached, they need to be able to pass that information on safely to their superiors. There\u2019s a lot more work to be done.\u201d A report published two years ago by the Dutch justice ministry noted that about 40% of \u201cprofessional integrity breaches\u201d in the police concerned officers with an immigrant background, who make up 7% of police personnel. It concluded that officers from immigrant communities were more likely to be approached by criminals and more vulnerable to such offers because of the \u201crelatively greater level of involvement of some ethnic groups\u201d in criminal activity, and the extended networks and complex loyalties of immigrant families.",

A 1950s prestige project for socialist East Germany, the grand boulevard that stretches from the city centre to Friedrichshain in the east has been the frontline of a months-long fight over gentrification and rising property prices. The struggle erupted last November when the property management firm Predac announced its intention to offload 700 apartments on the road to Berlin\u2019s largest property company, Deutsche Wohnen. Fearing rent increases, tenants organised protest marches and hung banners from their apartments, eventually pushing the city senate to block the sale. After months of legal wrangling, the senate confirmed on Monday that three blocs containing more than 670 apartments would instead be purchased by the state-owned housing provider Gewobag. While the price of the sale was not confirmed by either side, the move to renationalise the buildings on Karl-Marx-Allee is likely to come at a steep cost, with estimates ranging between \u20ac90m-\u20ac100m (\u00a380m-\u00a390m). Berlin\u2019s mayor said the move was indicative of a wider strategy to reacquire housing stock sold to private investors in the 1990s, following rapid rises in rental costs in the city in recent years. \u201cBerliners should be able to continue to afford living in the city,\u201d said Michael M\u00fcller. \u201cThat is why it was and continues to be our intention to buy up apartments wherever we can, so that Berlin can regain control of its property market.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Looking out from sky100, Hong Kong\u2019s highest observation deck on the 100th floor of the city\u2019s tallest building, the 494-metre-high International Commerce Centre, you get a 360-degree view of one of the world\u2019s most famous skylines \u2013 an urban jungle framed by mountains and the gleaming Victoria harbour, with endless clusters of high-rise buildings packed so closely together they resemble a game of Tetris. It\u2019s little wonder a city of such visible density has more skyscrapers than anywhere else in the world. According to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH), Hong Kong has 355 buildings over 150m in height. But having that accolade does not necessarily make Hong Kong the most vertical city. By different measures, other cities come out on top. According to building data research company Emporis, Seoul in South Korea has more high-rise buildings, with 16,359. Emporis defines a high-rise as a building at least 35m, or 12 storeys tall. In second place is Moscow, Russia, with 12,317 high-rises, followed by Hong Kong in third place, with 7,913. When it comes to the world\u2019s tallest buildings, Hong Kong doesn\u2019t even make the top 10. Dubai\u2019s Burj Khalifa takes top spot, at 828m. Dubai has 50 skyscrapers under construction, more than any other city. These include the 1,300m-tall Dubai Creek Tower, expected to be completed in 2020 and will be the tallest structure ever built. Meanwhile, the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen is the world leader in completing new skyscrapers. Last year it managed 14, ahead of Dubai\u2019s 10.

Following the February medevac leak, which led to a rebuke from Australia\u2019s spy boss for what he said was a misrepresentation of the advice, the home affairs secretary, Mike Pezzullo referred the matter for investigation. The AFP confirmed last month it had dropped the medevac leak investigation, but on Tuesday Colvin said it never got past the first hurdle. But at least two separate investigations into journalists who published sensitive information which embarrassed the government continue, despite wide spread outrage at the attack on press freedoms. Colvin, who announced he would step down from the his role in September earlier this week, told the ABC the investigation into leaked security advice which found its way into the Australian newspaper at the peak of the government\u2019s attempts to scuttle the medevac bill never began. \u201cWe didn\u2019t actually even launch an investigation,\u201d Colvin told 7.30\u2019s Leigh Sales. \u201cEvery matter that come in of this nature, we evaluate to see what we think the prospects of success were. And in that case, we didn\u2019t actually commence an investigation, because we immediately saw that the prospects of a successful investigation or prosecution were limited and the circumstances were entirely different to those other matters.\u201d The AFP raided News Corp political editor Annika Smethurst\u2019s home last month, over articles she wrote in April 2018 on the government plans to expand the powers of the nation\u2019s domestic surveillance agency. The following day, the ABC\u2019s Sydney headquarters were raided over articles known as the \u201cAfghan Files\u201d. Smethurst and the two ABC journalists, Daniel Oakes and Sam Clark remain under investigation, and at risk of prosecution. In the ABC case, police had already charged who they believed to have leaked the documents. Colvin said those cases were different. \u201cWhat I can see is that there\u2019s a lot of reporting on selected matters,\u201d he said. \u201cWe received in the order of 12 to 15 unauthorised disclosure leaks every year.

The best day of my life was being assured on the phone that the letter asking me to choose a hall of residence wasn\u2019t a mistake, despite me missing the offer by one grade. At university, I learned that Catholics faced the same guilt as Jews for breaking the rules, that most people\u2019s parents at university owned their own home, and that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jul/15/food-management-how-to-eat-on-a-budget\">a pack of bacon</a> wasn\u2019t a one-person serving (we\u2019d kept kosher at home). The real bonus was that I met my wife of 30 years in my final year.

Even then, I was conscious that this was an opportunity that had not been open to my parents.

      "bodyText": "They\u2019re supposed to be the best days of your life \u2013 but is university everything it\u2019s cracked up to be, now that it comes packaged with more stress and financial worries? Twenty or 30 years ago there were no tuition fees, students had grants and there seemed to be more time for socialising, drinking and generally having fun. We asked people from that era how they felt about their time at uni \u2013 and whether they really would describe it as the time of their lives. \u2018If you\u2019re dozing off hangovers, you\u2019re missing out on things you may not have the chance to do again\u2019 Will Ham Bevan, 45 University of Oxford, graduated 1996 It was the best and the worst of times. Mostly, I realised what a privilege it was to have three years simply to read books and explore English language and literature, but I had a severe stammer that made the first few terms difficult. I look back with huge regret at all the wasted opportunities. If you\u2019re dozing off hangovers each morning, you\u2019re missing out on things you\u2019ll probably never have the chance to do again in later life (and all subsidised, of course). I\u2019d love to go back and be an undergraduate again, but I\u2019d do it better. \u2018Uni transformed my life. I was a free-dinners boy from a rented flat; now I practise law\u2019 Ralph Nathan, 57 University of Leicester, 1982 Growing up in a rented flat in Hackney, I was a free-dinners boy and ashamed of it; university wasn\u2019t for the likes of us. The best day of my life was being assured on the phone that the letter asking me to choose a hall of residence wasn\u2019t a mistake, despite me missing the offer by one grade. At university, I learned that Catholics faced the same guilt as Jews for breaking the rules, that most people\u2019s parents at university owned their own home, and that a pack of bacon wasn\u2019t a one-person serving (we\u2019d kept kosher at home). The real bonus was that I met my wife of 30 years in my final year. I now practise law (and imposter syndrome) and never forget where I started. University transformed my life. \u2018I loved meeting new people, and the freedom to do almost whatever I liked, when I liked\u2019 Catherine Cooper, 47 University of Birmingham, 1992 I loved my time at university. It\u2019s the best of all worlds in many ways \u2013 you have the freedom of an adult while you still don\u2019t have the full responsibilities of one. I really enjoyed my English course and felt like I was treated as an adult in my studies for the first time in my life. Mainly, though, I loved meeting loads of new people, many of whom are still friends, and having the freedom to do almost whatever I liked, when I liked, as long as I got my work done (which I did \u2013 and I even enjoyed that too). There aren\u2019t many times in your life when you have so much freedom. \u2018I was conscious that this was an opportunity that had not been open to my parents\u2019 Rachael O\u2019Driscoll, 53 University of Newcastle, 1986 Looking back across a 30-year chasm, although I know that there were times when I struggled, the overwhelming feeling is one of gratitude. Even then, I was conscious that this was an opportunity that had not been open to my parents. My mother\u2019s family could not afford the expense of university and my father combined degree study with full-time work and a young family. Academically, I could have made more of my time \u2013 even this was a life lesson about the virtues of application! The forging of lifelong friendships was, however, what really made university such a positive experience. \u2018The degree was incidental to the student life I had in Liverpool, where my uni had a campus\u2019 Lee Partridge, 53 University of Lancaster, 1989 Perspective was university\u2019s greatest gift to me: the useful degree I gained from Lancaster was incidental to the experiences of my student life in Liverpool, where Lancaster had an offsite campus. Independence, uncertainty and a distance of 200 miles challenged previous social, emotional and cultural assumptions \u2013 and I also had to contend with the steep learning curve of budgeting and bill paying. Lifelong friendships forged through shared hardship, humour and happiness, and seeing yourself as part of the wider world \u2013 all of these I valued and encouraged our daughter to seek out for herself in her choice of university. Should I be worried that she\u2019s chosen somewhere 400 miles away? The British School of Malting and Brewing, Birmingham University, 1969 \u2018I became arts editor on the student radio station. It was the start of my journalistic career\u2019 Annemarie Flanagan, 55 University of Warwick, 1988 I loved my time at Warwick studying history and politics. I struggle to remember anything bad about it. I just recall making great friends, having so much fun and loving most of the studying. I got involved in the student radio station and became arts editor, which paved the way for my future journalistic career, and no doubt helped get me my early jobs in independent radio and then the BBC. My second-year house in Coventry was awful, though \u2013 freezing cold with mould on the walls. But we were there when the football team won the FA cup and it was a blast! \u2018I learned much more outside the lecture theatre or lab than inside it. Embrace the whole experience\u2019 John Flynn, 60 University of Leicester, 1982 My time at university was a wonderful life experience that resulted in lifetime friendships. Sure, I learned a lot of physics that gave me a great career, but I also learned much more outside the lecture theatre or lab than inside it, such as how to manage my own time, money, studies and social life, and simply how to get along with a variety of people from many different walks of life. I have the impression that students nowadays seem to prioritise course studies over the extracurricular opportunities available, but I\u2019d encourage them to embrace the whole experience \u2013 it\u2019s a chance not to be missed! \u2018It was a time of self-discovery. I was the first in my family to go to uni and I saw it as a real privilege\u2019 Krutika Pau, 57 University of Lancaster, 1983 I was at Lancaster University from 1980 to 1983 and did a combined degree in psychology and educational studies.

I am a Londoner and at Lancaster I grew to love the vast open green spaces of the Lancashire countryside \u2013 it gave me a lifelong love of walking and hiking. \u2018Freshers\u2019 week was one of the worst of my life. Fortunately, I stuck with it and found my niche\u2019 Ravi Jayaram, 51 University of Newcastle, 1990 When I first went to university, the shock to my middle-class, small-town, naive self was shattering. I knew nobody, I missed my mum, I missed my friends and I missed the security of the life from which I\u2019d felt desperate to escape.

It has taken me till the age of 51 and having teenage children of my own to realise that everyone else was feeling exactly the same \u2013 but could hide it more convincingly. \u2018I was happy hanging out with friends, surviving on a diet of chips, garlic bread and cider\u2019 Bianca Alder, 48 Cardiff University, 1993 I didn\u2019t really care where I went or what I studied.

      "body": "<p>Before your child starts university, it\u2019s helpful to think about challenges they have already faced, and talk with them about how they might handle these at university. Although it\u2019s a new start, problems don\u2019t just go away \u2013 university life is, and should be, challenging. So help your children develop <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jul/16/it-took-months-to-get-used-to-barely-hearing-from-her-one-familys-university-story\">practical skills</a> (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jul/15/food-management-how-to-eat-on-a-budget\">cooking</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jul/15/packing-for-uni-essentials-for-a-happy-home\">shopping</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jul/15/fees-and-funding-think-of-your-loan-as-a-graduate-tax\">budgeting</a>) but, equally importantly, let them lead on making decisions for themselves and managing the consequences of those decisions.</p> <p>It\u2019s much better for them to be prepared for what they may encounter at university rather than struggling because the demands on them come as a surprise. At Reading, for example, we run workshops called Life Tools, which help equip students with strategies for managing academic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jul/16/mental-health-at-university-wellbeing-tips-for-students\">pressure</a>, using critical feedback constructively and building confidence.</p> <p>A uni\u2019s website should give you an idea of the support available. We have a student welfare team, a student financial support team and our own counselling service. Although we aim to get information to students before they know they need it, there is so much support available that they don\u2019t always remember. It\u2019s helpful if parents can reinforce that message, so they know they can turn, for example, to their academic tutor if they\u2019re having a problem with their course.</p> <p>Students generally arrive at university with the adage that university will be the best time of their lives ringing in their ears, and those who have had problems before may think things will be different just because they are in a new place with new people \u2013 so if a challenge does arise they may not know where to turn for help. Many universities, including Reading, have buddying schemes that pair experienced students with new students, to help them settle in and to direct them to any support they need.</p> <p>Almost all new students worry that they won\u2019t make friends. That\u2019s what freshers\u2019 week is all about. As well as attending student union-run activities involving nightclubs or parties, it\u2019s important for students to go to events organised by their department \u2013 at Reading, for example, every department organises events that encourage students to work together in teams on something relating to their subject, so they get to know each other quickly and easily.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2f350a640c5d953940c6fa1ebff525dc163cd67a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f350a640c5d953940c6fa1ebff525dc163cd67a/0_0_314_259/314.png\" alt=\"Dr Paddy Woodman\" width=\"314\" height=\"259\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Paddy Woodman</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reading Uni</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Having fun is not all about alcohol. These days, universities and students\u2019 unions run lots of events that don\u2019t involve drinking, and there are hundreds of clubs and societies, so there are activities to suit everyone, and lots of opportunities to make friends.</p> <p>Finally, it\u2019s important for both students and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jul/16/my-son-going-to-university-made-my-own-course-possible\">parents</a> to have realistic expectations. Universities aren\u2019t boarding schools \u2013 they don\u2019t have responsibility for every aspect of students\u2019 lives. That\u2019s important, because a big part of going to university is growing up and learning to be independent. Your child needs to be ready for this, and you need to be ready to give them space to shape themselves into the adults they want to be \u2013 while still holding the safety net of parental support. If you think your child is likely to struggle with their mental health, it is important to recognise this and seek early advice from mental health professionals.</p> <p><em>Dr Paddy Woodman is director of student services at the University of Reading.

      "bodyText": "Before your child starts university, it\u2019s helpful to think about challenges they have already faced, and talk with them about how they might handle these at university. Although it\u2019s a new start, problems don\u2019t just go away \u2013 university life is, and should be, challenging. So help your children develop practical skills (cooking, shopping, budgeting) but, equally importantly, let them lead on making decisions for themselves and managing the consequences of those decisions. It\u2019s much better for them to be prepared for what they may encounter at university rather than struggling because the demands on them come as a surprise. At Reading, for example, we run workshops called Life Tools, which help equip students with strategies for managing academic pressure, using critical feedback constructively and building confidence. A uni\u2019s website should give you an idea of the support available. We have a student welfare team, a student financial support team and our own counselling service. Although we aim to get information to students before they know they need it, there is so much support available that they don\u2019t always remember. It\u2019s helpful if parents can reinforce that message, so they know they can turn, for example, to their academic tutor if they\u2019re having a problem with their course. Students generally arrive at university with the adage that university will be the best time of their lives ringing in their ears, and those who have had problems before may think things will be different just because they are in a new place with new people \u2013 so if a challenge does arise they may not know where to turn for help. Many universities, including Reading, have buddying schemes that pair experienced students with new students, to help them settle in and to direct them to any support they need. Almost all new students worry that they won\u2019t make friends. That\u2019s what freshers\u2019 week is all about. As well as attending student union-run activities involving nightclubs or parties, it\u2019s important for students to go to events organised by their department \u2013 at Reading, for example, every department organises events that encourage students to work together in teams on something relating to their subject, so they get to know each other quickly and easily. Having fun is not all about alcohol. These days, universities and students\u2019 unions run lots of events that don\u2019t involve drinking, and there are hundreds of clubs and societies, so there are activities to suit everyone, and lots of opportunities to make friends. Finally, it\u2019s important for both students and parents to have realistic expectations. Universities aren\u2019t boarding schools \u2013 they don\u2019t have responsibility for every aspect of students\u2019 lives. That\u2019s important, because a big part of going to university is growing up and learning to be independent. Your child needs to be ready for this, and you need to be ready to give them space to shape themselves into the adults they want to be \u2013 while still holding the safety net of parental support. If you think your child is likely to struggle with their mental health, it is important to recognise this and seek early advice from mental health professionals. Dr Paddy Woodman is director of student services at the University of Reading. As told to Kim Thomas",

She also took enough dinner plates for a full-blown party. \u201cWe were super organised \u2013 we went around Ikea with a list,\u201d says her mum Sharon. \u201cBut her room was that small you could touch the walls.\u201d</p> <p>University was a late decision for Emily, who\u2019d been adamant she would choose an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/mar/05/best-of-both-how-degree-level-apprenticeships-blend-work-and-study\">apprenticeship</a> instead, \u201cpartly because my sixth form put so much pressure on us to apply (to university) and I rebelled\u201d. But, encouraged by good marks and the realisation that friends would be leaving her home city of Nottingham, she took a late trip to look around Hull \u2013 the first and only university she looked at. \u201cI absolutely fell in love with it,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople were so friendly and encouraging and it was so picturesque. I\u2019d never been around a campus, so I was massively outside my comfort zone, but the lecturers had a genuine interest in us.\u201d</p> <p>Although neither Mum nor Dad put pressure on her, Emily realises university meant a lot to them. \u201cThey were so proud I\u2019d applied myself\u201d \u2013 she did well in her A-levels, with an A* and a B, plus a distinction in BTec \u2013 \u201cand that I could survive alone. They wanted me to make the most of myself. Then Hull made me an unconditional offer, which felt like a big release of pressure. Having the aim of university and a bright future gave me such a drive to work.\u201d</p> <p>Sharon didn\u2019t hear much from Emily during her first year. \u201cI\u2019d turned 18, I could buy drink legally, and there were so many new people,\u201d says Emily. \u201cI went home once but the train ride was expensive and I didn\u2019t want to ask for money \u2013 the whole point was I was living independently. It sounds really selfish now, but I was living at 100 miles an hour \u2013 I didn\u2019t have time to think about the life I\u2019d left behind.\u201d</p> <p>Knowing her daughter had a decent room and an en suite bathroom, was comfort to her parents. \u201cIt took about three months to get used to barely hearing from her, but we knew she was happy and safe \u2013 although we did worry she was drinking Hull dry. But then the kids of some of my friends didn\u2019t even make it to Christmas at uni, they were so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/dec/19/homesickness-at-university-is-there-a-cure\">homesick</a>.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jul/12/applying-to-university-how-to-make-an-open-day-worthwhile\">Applying to university: how to make an open day worthwhile</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By the time Emily returned for her second year, the family thought they were prepared for the realities of student accommodation.

She also took enough dinner plates for a full-blown party. \u201cWe were super organised \u2013 we went around Ikea with a list,\u201d says her mum Sharon. \u201cBut her room was that small you could touch the walls.\u201d University was a late decision for Emily, who\u2019d been adamant she would choose an apprenticeship instead, \u201cpartly because my sixth form put so much pressure on us to apply (to university) and I rebelled\u201d. But, encouraged by good marks and the realisation that friends would be leaving her home city of Nottingham, she took a late trip to look around Hull \u2013 the first and only university she looked at. \u201cI absolutely fell in love with it,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople were so friendly and encouraging and it was so picturesque. I\u2019d never been around a campus, so I was massively outside my comfort zone, but the lecturers had a genuine interest in us.\u201d Although neither Mum nor Dad put pressure on her, Emily realises university meant a lot to them. \u201cThey were so proud I\u2019d applied myself\u201d \u2013 she did well in her A-levels, with an A* and a B, plus a distinction in BTec \u2013 \u201cand that I could survive alone. They wanted me to make the most of myself. Then Hull made me an unconditional offer, which felt like a big release of pressure. Having the aim of university and a bright future gave me such a drive to work.\u201d Sharon didn\u2019t hear much from Emily during her first year. \u201cI\u2019d turned 18, I could buy drink legally, and there were so many new people,\u201d says Emily. \u201cI went home once but the train ride was expensive and I didn\u2019t want to ask for money \u2013 the whole point was I was living independently. It sounds really selfish now, but I was living at 100 miles an hour \u2013 I didn\u2019t have time to think about the life I\u2019d left behind.\u201d Knowing her daughter had a decent room and an en suite bathroom, was comfort to her parents. \u201cIt took about three months to get used to barely hearing from her, but we knew she was happy and safe \u2013 although we did worry she was drinking Hull dry. But then the kids of some of my friends didn\u2019t even make it to Christmas at uni, they were so homesick.\u201d By the time Emily returned for her second year, the family thought they were prepared for the realities of student accommodation. They weren\u2019t. \u201cThere was a shopping trolley in the kitchen full of recycling,\u201d says Sharon. \u201cIf you used the bath, you\u2019d come out dirtier than when you went in. It was damp, it was horrendous.\u201d Hull is one of the cheapest cities for students, and Emily supplemented her loans by working as a student ambassador; she also received an academic bursary. \u201cI don\u2019t spend money carelessly, only on stuff I need. Buying books second hand saves a lot.\u201d Emily\u2019s dad, Malcolm, says university has given his daughter freedom and space to develop, and he hopes Emily\u2019s brother, recently enrolled at Nottingham Trent, will follow suit. \u201cIt\u2019s about giving them opportunities we didn\u2019t have,\u201d says Malcolm. \u201cWe hope Emily will find a path in life that leads her to do something she loves. It\u2019s been the making of her.\u201d Emily is now completing a year-long placement at Jaguar Land Rover, before she returns to Hull for her final year. \u201cIt has completely changed me as a person, I wouldn\u2019t recognise myself,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve learned so much \u2013 academically, socially, and about real life.

      "bodyText": "Former cabinet ministers could be among those who feel they have no choice but to vote down a Boris Johnson administration in order to prevent a no-deal Brexit, Dominic Grieve has said. The former attorney general said it was significant that both Johnson and his rival, Jeremy Hunt, had rejected any prospect of compromise on the backstop at a Sun leadership hustings on Monday night. Johnson and Hunt declared the Northern Ireland backstop \u201cdead\u201d and ruled out trying to tweak it, saying it was no good to have a time limit on the backstop or a way of the UK exiting it unilaterally \u2013 even though Eurosceptics had previously indicated they could vote for such compromises. Grieve said the tough stance was not surprising but signalled that no deal was more likely. \u201cI think it is significant because I have heard it suggested \u2013 not just in this country but in the EU \u2013 that there might be some possibility of compromise by the backstop being tweaked,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the face of it, this entirely rules it out, which is always what I thought would happen.\u201d Grieve, who has led multiple rebellions in parliament to attempt to stop leaving the EU without a deal, including recent efforts to amend the Northern Ireland bill to prevent a prime minister proroguing parliament, said MPs were running out of other legislative options. \u201cBlocking no deal technically may be quite difficult but as I\u2019ve said on many occasions in the last 12 months, if the government persists in trying to carry out a no-deal Brexit I think that administration is going to fall,\u201d he said. He said Tory MPs would want to avoid a no-confidence vote, giving it could pave the way for a general election. MPs who voted against their own party in a confidence vote are likely to lose the whip and be de-selected at the next election. \u201cAll Conservatives want to find a way out of this that avoids bringing down one\u2019s own administration and if I could find a way \u2013 and I have been trying to find different ways of gently nudging a government away from no deal \u2013 then I will take it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, by the end of next week there are going to be more Conservatives who have indicated no deal is unacceptable and many of them will no longer be on the frontbench.\u201d Asked if he meant whether the chancellor, Philip Hammond, or the justice secretary, David Gauke, might be prepared to take such steps, Grieve did not say it was certain. \u201cCertainly my impression talking to colleagues in the house is if we get to the point where no deal becomes a real prospect then there are going to be more colleagues opposed to it because they think it is going to be catastrophic,\u201d he said. A new prime minister\u2019s working majority in the Commons is likely to be reduced to three if the Liberal Democrats win the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection on 1 August. Two MPs, Grieve and Kenneth Clarke, have suggested they would be prepared to vote against the government but a number of other MPs have positions that are uncertain. They include the independent Northern Irish MP Lady Sylvia Hermon, and the former Labour MPs Frank Field, Ian Austin and John Woodcock, who are strongly opposed to a Jeremy Corbyn government. Grieve launched a report from the People\u2019s Vote campaign on Tuesday that claims six possible scenarios for the next phase of Brexit will all end in deadlock in parliament. The report argues that changing the backstop was \u201ctested to destruction by Theresa May\u201d and a Northern Ireland-only backstop would be rejected by parliament. Neither option is being proposed by Johnson or Hunt, but the report also concludes a tweaked version of May\u2019s deal with cosmetic changes to the backstop or a longer transition period would also fail to pass parliament. It also highlights \u201cenormous risks\u201d for the new prime minister of calling a general election. \u201cAssuming it took place before 20 November, defeat would make them the shortest serving prime minister of the United Kingdom in history, beating the record set when George Canning died in August 1827 after 119 days in office.\u201d",

The party achieved brief notoriety in late 2017 after Donald Trump retweeted anti-Muslim messages sent by the party\u2019s then deputy leader, Jayda Fransen, prompting international condemnation. Fransen and Britain First\u2019s then leader, Paul Golding, were both jailed the following March for religiously aggravated harassment after a court heard they targeted people they believed were connected to a rape trial involving Muslim defendants. Britain First has not been a registered political party since November 2017, but it must pay a total of \u00a344,200 following an investigation that identified a series of offences. The fine comprised \u00a311,000 for failing to keep accurate financial records of transactions in 2016; \u00a37,700 for failing to file any quarterly donation reports in 2016, totalling \u00a3200,000 of undeclared donations; \u00a35,500 for not having its 2016 accounts professionally audited; and a final \u00a320,000 \u2013 the maximum possible \u2013 for failing to provide information sought by the commission.

It stood some candidates in the 2014 European elections, but was condemned by the family of Lee Rigby for referring to the murder of the soldier by Islamist attackers in an election broadcast. In the 2016 London mayoral election, Golding stood for the party and finished eighth, on 1.2% of the vote, marginally above the Cannabis is Safer than Alcohol party.",

It also leaves Delloye in an even deeper hole as he tries to get the weekend somewhere close to break-even point, never mind into the black.</p> \n<p>Does it matter that the Arc is a loss-maker? In some ways, no. Thanks to the PMU monopoly on betting in France, the gross profit margin on betting turnover is between 15% and 25% depending on the pool (and the high-margin pools such as the Tierce are the most popular).

British racing\u2019s funding model has its flaws, as everyone knows, but it does at least enjoy a variety of income streams, one of which is the money generated by shifting nearly 6m tickets every year and the revenue from food, drinks, hospitality, betting and so on that goes with it.</p> \n<p>French racing has lots of money from its PMU monopoly but none of the emotional capital that comes from the shared experience of a big day at the races. As a result, it is highly vulnerable to any decline in betting turnover, either because punters lose interest in racing or through competition from other forms of gambling.</p> \n<p>France is one of the great European racing nations and the home of the continent\u2019s most glamorous Flat race, so we should all wish it well.

There is something very British about the fact we have many, many words to describe types of falling moisture (mist, drizzle, hail, sleet, etc) and yet the most dramatic and powerful of emotions \u2013 motivating billions of humans to do extraordinary things for one another each day \u2013 is chucked into a single bucket labelled, rather blandly, \u201clove\u201d. One can\u2019t help but feel that the ancient Greeks had it right, by pulling love apart into various strands. <em>Storge</em> (\u201cstore-gae\u201d) is the love between family members, for instance; <em>eros</em> is erotic love; <em>philia</em> is something like the loyalty that friendship brings; <em>philautia</em> is love for the self. And so, in this piece, I would like to break the concept of pet love into these neat and easily digestible Greek chunks.</p> \n<p>To storge, familial love. It won\u2019t surprise you to learn that dogs, more than any other pet, exhibit oodles of this form of love for us. And, unlike most other pets, these attachments have been the subject of many scientific studies. The science confirms what we knew all along, that most dogs actively choose proximity to humans and, within a few months of being born, a puppy\u2019s attraction is clearly toward people rather than other dogs. Dogs exhibit varying degrees of separation anxiety when their humans temporarily leave them. Blood pressure rates in dogs lower when they are being stroked by us. It is a form of storge that we share with one another. No question.</p> \n<p>Studies of brain chemicals add further weight to this relationship. In dogs and humans (in fact all mammals) the behaviours that bond individuals are maintained through a cocktail of molecules that are absorbed in different ways by the brain. Many of these are regulated by brain hormones that include vasopressin and oxytocin, the (dramatically over-hyped) \u201clove\u201d molecule. In all mammals (including humans) production of this hormone spikes when individuals are sexually aroused, while giving birth and while nursing offspring. It also rises when we see those that we love, particularly close family members. Interestingly, dogs respond with an oxytocin surge not only when interacting with one another, but also (unlike nearly all other mammals) when interacting with humans.</p> \n<p>A similar phenomenon occurs with cats. <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/bbc-documentary-answers-age-old-question-which-love-us-more-cats-or-dogs-a6844846.html\" title=\"\">One small-scale study</a> suggests that cats do receive an oxytocin boost upon being petted by their owners, so there may be love there, but it reflects one-fifth of the amount seen in dogs.

Thankfully, most dogs or cats don\u2019t view us in an erotic light. Even leg-humping isn\u2019t likely to be a sex thing. The intentions of a horny dog may not necessarily be to inseminate their owner\u2019s leg, but instead to manage unresolved tensions within the human-canine household. Some argue it could be about dominance; others that it could be to let off steam. There is also a chance that, well, a bit of friendly leg-humping just feels really nice to a dog, but not necessarily in a knowing, sexual way. The behaviour is seen in male and female dogs, and, occasionally, in cats.</p> \n<p>Birds, however, are another story. Birds are far more likely to feel a warmth for their owners that you could term eros. A parrot that is tenderly stroked in the wrong places by its minder, for instance, will often misread friendship signals as foreplay and begin producing sex hormones. Should you wish not to sexually excite a parrot, try not to stroke down its back or on, or under, its wings. These are the areas that males and females preen in the early stages of their courtship in the wild. A stroke like this is like the kiss and a cuddle that readies them for sex. Upon discovering this fact, I realised I had more than once inadvertently sexed up a parrot.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"094d2604-ad7e-4dc7-8ece-e831f9077c29\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NGJLRkZzKbM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Ancient Greeks had no word for cupboard love, but, undoubtedly, this is a love the vast majority of animal pets may feel for us.

      "bodyText": "It is almost a year to the day since Dustin, our milky-eyed nervebag of a cat, died and we still miss him a great deal, although he was not a great giver of emotion. We miss his refusing to look our way immensely. And his not wanting to be stroked there, there or there. But it wasn\u2019t Dustin\u2019s fault he was like this. Unknown trauma in kittenhood (he was left in a shoebox at the front door of a vet\u2019s surgery) meant that he lived his entire 11 years in terror of being mauled to death by some unseen enemy. Understandably, this constant fear made Dustin very, very nervous.

There can never be an acceptance of exploitation, of death from cancer and pollution. Slavery was fought with an abolition movement. Jim Crow was opposed by civil rights leaders. This era of toxic pollution must be stopped too. Many people in Reserve, and elsewhere in Cancer Alley, have been fighting this for years, all too often ignored by their elected representatives. It is particularly telling that Louisiana has just passed a regressive anti-abortion law while doing little to help the residents of Reserve. I would challenge every so-called \u201cpro-life\u201d politician in Louisiana who is not also advocating on behalf of the citizens of Reserve to rethink that moniker. All of this is why I will come to Reserve later this month. Our movement, the Poor People\u2019s Campaign, is built from the bottom up and aims to shift the moral narrative around this country. We want to make sure people don\u2019t just hear the facts and figures about Cancer Alley, but they see the faces, the humanity, and the people that are being impacted. We believe there must be a policy remedy to what is going on in Reserve. Too often, corporate exploitation and government failures occur in the darkness, away from the media spotlight. We must expose what is happening there to the light now. We hope the people in Reserve will become part of our nationwide struggle. Cancertown: A Conversation on the most toxic air in America \u2013 a series of events in New Orleans and Reserve will take place on 26 and 27 July. The event is co-sponsored by the Guardian and the Poor People\u2019s Campaign",

Drug counsellors and campaigners blame a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of more people using multiple drugs at the same time, including those already being prescribed substitution treatment such as methadone, unpredictably strong prescription drugs flooding the market, and decades-long addicts in already fragile health.</p> <p>Drug use, and the numbers of deaths associated with it, has been significantly higher in Scotland than the rest of the UK since the heroin epidemic of the 80s and early 90s. Scotland has also seen more depressant-based substance abuse, including alcohol, which carries a greater risk of fatalities.</p> <p>Experts point out that today\u2019s figures also indicate a smaller but significant increase in deaths amongst under-35s, who are more likely to overdose because of poly-drug use, including the newly available \u201cstreet benzodiazepines\u201d.</p> <p>At the beginning of the year, local outreach workers linked an unprecedented rise in the number of deaths of homeless people in Glasgow to illegal versions of prescription tranquillisers.</p> <p>Dr Carole Hunter, lead pharmacist for addiction services at the city\u2019s health and social care partnership, which had the highest rate of fatalities in 2018, said: \u201cThe major problem for Glasgow is heroin and illicit benzos like etizolam or street valium, which have never been cheaper or more available. People buy it online, in huge quantities, and unknown quality. You could take 10 one day and be fine, and the next day take the same amount and overdose.\u201d</p> <p>Hunter is working towards the opening of enhanced drug treatment centre in Glasgow later this year, the first clinic of its kind in the UK to administer medical grade heroin to addicts under strict supervision.</p> <p>Findings from international trials now suggest that the supervised use of medicinal heroin can be an effective alternative treatment for the small minority of entrenched opioid users who fail to respond to mainstream substitution therapy using methadone or buprenorphine.</p> <p>Hunter also believes that Glasgow\u2019s addict population needs a drug consumption room, which is championed by the city\u2019s council as well as its SNP and Labour MPs. \u201cRemember that a drug consumption room is much more than a place to inject safely; it offers healthcare, advice and support.\u201d</p> <p>Some campaigners caution that drug policy must not be overshadowed by political wrangling about Westminster intransigence, while others point to the opportunities for radical improvements within the existing law.</p> <p>Roy Robertson has been a GP in Muirhouse, where Trainspotting was set, since 1980 and is now professor of addiction medicine at Edinburgh.</p> <p>\u201cDespite all theses political diversions, clinical services remain fragmented and poorly supported. The new GP contract has not helped and the culture of low doses of treatment in NHS services remains a problem that generates the unintended consequence of self-medication with other drugs.\u201d</p> <p>The problem of \u201csub-optimal dosing\u201d is familiar to Dave Liddell, chief executive, Scottish Drugs Forum, who describes a \u201cvery rigid\u201d model \u201cwhich punishes people with reduced doses for not turning up to appointments or discharges them entirely\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNeither decriminalisation or one drug consumption room in Glasgow is going to impact substantially on the death rate. The key focus needs to be on improving on improving our drug treatment and care services. We need to look at access to opioid replacement therapy. Only 40% of people with a drug problem in Scotland are currently in treatment, compared with far higher numbers in England and many countries in Europe.\u201d</p>",

Drugs legislation, including the Misuse of Drugs Act, is currently reserved to Westminster, which has resisted initial attempts to relax the law north of the border. Growing cross-party concern around what public health minister Joe FitzPatrick calls an \u201cemergency\u201d has been accompanied by increased momentum around legislative change, including the relatively minor amendments required for a medically supervised drug consumption room in Glasgow, which the Home Office has refused to sanction. Following a lengthy investigation, the tabloid the Daily Record backed decriminalisation in an editorial earlier this month, while one of Police Scotland\u2019s most senior police officers, described the Misuse of Drugs Act as a relic that was \u201cripe for reform\u201d. Giving evidence to the Scottish affairs select committee, which is currently undertaking its own inquiry into problem drug use in Scotland, in early July, assistant chief constable Steve Johnson pleaded with politicians to have \u201cconfidence and courage\u201d to decriminalise, as well as underlining his support for drug consumption rooms. Speaking to the same committee last week, Scotland\u2019s highest law officer, the lord advocate James Wolffe, QC, suggested that some de facto decriminalisation was already taking place, confirming that in cases of simple possession he advises prosecutors to keep users out of the justice system. The newly appointed chair of the Scottish government\u2019s task force on drug deaths, Catriona Matheson, told the Guardian that as well as considering international evidence around decriminalisation and de facto decriminalisation, she would also investigate challenges around treatment services and stigma. \u201cI understand why decriminalisation grabs most attention, but legislation, criminal justice, healthcare and public attitudes are intertwined,\u201d Matheson said. \u201cThe public mood is changing but there\u2019s still a need to inform people about the reality of addicts\u2019 lives, and we need more sensitive reporting.\u201d A range of factors have contributed to the steady rise of drug fatalities in Scotland. Drug counsellors and campaigners blame a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of more people using multiple drugs at the same time, including those already being prescribed substitution treatment such as methadone, unpredictably strong prescription drugs flooding the market, and decades-long addicts in already fragile health. Drug use, and the numbers of deaths associated with it, has been significantly higher in Scotland than the rest of the UK since the heroin epidemic of the 80s and early 90s. Scotland has also seen more depressant-based substance abuse, including alcohol, which carries a greater risk of fatalities. Experts point out that today\u2019s figures also indicate a smaller but significant increase in deaths amongst under-35s, who are more likely to overdose because of poly-drug use, including the newly available \u201cstreet benzodiazepines\u201d. At the beginning of the year, local outreach workers linked an unprecedented rise in the number of deaths of homeless people in Glasgow to illegal versions of prescription tranquillisers. Dr Carole Hunter, lead pharmacist for addiction services at the city\u2019s health and social care partnership, which had the highest rate of fatalities in 2018, said: \u201cThe major problem for Glasgow is heroin and illicit benzos like etizolam or street valium, which have never been cheaper or more available. People buy it online, in huge quantities, and unknown quality. You could take 10 one day and be fine, and the next day take the same amount and overdose.\u201d Hunter is working towards the opening of enhanced drug treatment centre in Glasgow later this year, the first clinic of its kind in the UK to administer medical grade heroin to addicts under strict supervision. Findings from international trials now suggest that the supervised use of medicinal heroin can be an effective alternative treatment for the small minority of entrenched opioid users who fail to respond to mainstream substitution therapy using methadone or buprenorphine. Hunter also believes that Glasgow\u2019s addict population needs a drug consumption room, which is championed by the city\u2019s council as well as its SNP and Labour MPs. \u201cRemember that a drug consumption room is much more than a place to inject safely; it offers healthcare, advice and support.\u201d Some campaigners caution that drug policy must not be overshadowed by political wrangling about Westminster intransigence, while others point to the opportunities for radical improvements within the existing law. Roy Robertson has been a GP in Muirhouse, where Trainspotting was set, since 1980 and is now professor of addiction medicine at Edinburgh. \u201cDespite all theses political diversions, clinical services remain fragmented and poorly supported. The new GP contract has not helped and the culture of low doses of treatment in NHS services remains a problem that generates the unintended consequence of self-medication with other drugs.\u201d The problem of \u201csub-optimal dosing\u201d is familiar to Dave Liddell, chief executive, Scottish Drugs Forum, who describes a \u201cvery rigid\u201d model \u201cwhich punishes people with reduced doses for not turning up to appointments or discharges them entirely\u201d. \u201cNeither decriminalisation or one drug consumption room in Glasgow is going to impact substantially on the death rate. The key focus needs to be on improving on improving our drug treatment and care services. We need to look at access to opioid replacement therapy. Only 40% of people with a drug problem in Scotland are currently in treatment, compared with far higher numbers in England and many countries in Europe.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "From the menswear designer who brought us prints of Mr Blobby and a British interpretation of Las Vegas Americana came a much lauded take on The Flintstones at London fashion week men\u2019s last month. It was the latest chapter in London-based designer Liam Hodge\u2019s phenomenal success tale that has seen him work his way up the ranks for the last six years to become a key player on the LFWM schedule. Yet the takeaway print this time was born out of a collaboration with a fellow creative. The brains behind the artwork was British artist Alfie Kungu, a rising star in his own right since he graduated with a degree in Fine Art at the UWE Bristol in 2016, later becoming part of Saatchi\u2019s Best of the Year collection in 2017. The pair first crossed paths when Kungu modelled for Hodges\u2019 SS19 runway show last June. After expressing adoration for one another\u2019s creations via Instagram, they linked up at the artist\u2019s studio to discuss what a potential collaboration might look like. \u201cIt was quite casual really. I was just asking what he had been up to and what his ideas were. Liam told me that he had been mudlarking in the Thames and had found a lot of metals and jewellery but also bones. We joked about how nasty it was, but realised that it does tie in [with the ideas for Liam\u2019s new collection] such as moving with the times, technology and how we remove ourselves from reality and IRL communication, affection and relationships.

      "bodyText": "Netflix has removed a controversial suicide scene from its teen drama 13 Reasons Why more than two years on from its premiere. In a statement, the streaming service said that the three-minute-long sequence from the show\u2019s first season, which depicts the central character taking her own life, had been re-edited on the advice of medical experts. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard from many young people that 13 Reasons Why encouraged them to start conversations about difficult issues like depression and suicide and get help \u2013 often for the first time,\u201d Netflix said. \u201cAs we prepare to launch season three later this summer, we\u2019ve been mindful about the ongoing debate around the show. So on the advice of medical experts, including Dr Christine Moutier, chief medical officer at the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, we\u2019ve decided with creator Brian Yorkey and the producers to edit the scene in which Hannah takes her own life.\u201d Adapted from Jay Asher\u2019s young adult novel of the same name, 13 Reasons Why concerns the suicide of high-school student Hannah Baker and the effect her death has on her classmates. The re-edited scene, which had previously depicted Baker\u2019s suicide in graphic detail, now cuts directly from a shot of the character looking at herself in the mirror to her parents reacting to her death. In a statement, the Samaritans welcomed Netflix\u2019s decision to remove the sequence, and said that the charity had been working with the streaming service\u2019s UK arm to provide advice on how to safely portray suicide. \u201cWhile covering difficult topics in drama can help to increase understanding and encourage people to seek help, it\u2019s important this is done in a responsible way due to the evidenced risks associated with covering this topic in the media\u201d, Lorna Fraser, of the charity\u2019s media advisory service, said. \u201cProgramme makers should always seek advice from experts on the portrayal of suicide, to ensure any risk to vulnerable viewers is minimised.\u201d Netflix was criticised by the Samaritans and mental health groups over for the \u201csensationalised\u201d nature of the scene upon the drama\u2019s release in April 2017, with a spokesperson for the Royal College of Psychiatrists saying that dramatic depictions of suicide \u201cneedlessly put vulnerable young people at risk of copycat behaviour\u201d. A report released earlier this year by the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, meanwhile, found that suicide among teenagers rose by 28.9% in the month after the launch of the first season. While the report cited no direct causation between the scene and the increase, its co-author called on the media to \u201cbe constructive and thoughtful\u201d about its influence over vulnerable people. In the wake of the controversy, Netflix added cards warning viewers of graphic content, as well as creating a website that provided support for those affected by the themes of the show. The decision to re-edit the offending scene follows the removal of a sequence in its dystopian drama Bird Box that featured footage from a real-life rail disaster. Despite the controversy around 13 Reasons Why, the drama has proved popular among Netflix\u2019s audience, with six million viewers watching the opening episode of its second season within three days of its launch, according to independent estimates by Nielsen. A third season is due later this year. In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

Pierson had moved there with her \u201cfuture ex-husband\u201d to go back to the land, not to make art. \u201cIt was a farmers\u2019 town: there was a hardware store, a feed store and a seed store. I had this place for $15 a month in the middle of a field, a funky old shack \u2013 it was the love shack! I lived out there and we formed our own group of crazy individuals: eccentrics and artists just having fun together and creating our own fun. We were hanging out and crashing parties together. If there was free beer we would crash the party and create havoc. One time I took a garden hose into the house and sprayed it around. Luckily they were my friends, and it was a rented house.\u201d</p> <p>Among the eccentrics were Ricky Wilson and his sister Cindy, Keith Strickland and Schneider, and the idea of forming a band came after they shared a Flaming Volcano cocktail at a Chinese restaurant. \u201cWe are all big music fans. Fred had a huge record collection. We all listened to really eclectic stuff, and there was the University of Georgia music library, so we had access to African music. I was a really early fan of African music. We listened to Perez Prado and Kai Winding, and soul music, and B-movie soundtracks and Nino Rota. There was no internet then, so we were looking in encyclopaedias for inspiration.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4QSYx4wVQg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/n4QSYx4wVQg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>From that stew came Rock Lobster. The lyric came from a disco in Atlanta called 2001 \u2013 \u201cFred really got inspired when he was at a disco and saw these crustaceans projected on the walls\u201d \u2013 but the song was propelled by the riff Wilson picked out on his Mosrite guitar. \u201cAt first, Rock Lobster\u2019s success was a complete surprise. We\u2019d been saying to each other: \u2018This is so weird; who\u2019s going to listen to this?\u2019 When we played our first party in Athens, our friends all danced: that\u2019s a really great sign. We knew we were on to something.\u201d</p> <h2>Mesopotamia <br>(from Mesopotamia EP, 1982)</h2> <p>After their second album, Wild Planet, went Top 20 on both sides of the Atlantic, the pressure was on to reach the next level of success, and the B-52s went into the studio with David Byrne producing, for what was supposed to be their third album, but ended up being the six-track EP Mesopotamia. Why didn\u2019t they finish an album? \u201cIt was wrongly stated that we had some kind of conflict with David Byrne, but that\u2019s not true at all. It was really our manager Gary Kurfirst, who was also Talking Heads\u2019 manager, who felt we needed to keep the momentum going. So we just bowed to his pressure to cut it short and put out what we had. Songs like Cake were never really finished.\u201d The sound of the first two records had been dictated by Island Records boss <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/audio/2009/may/22/island-record-chris-blackwell\">Chris Blackwell</a>, who wanted them to sound sparse, like their live sound. \u201cBut we were kind of disappointed \u2013 we wanted to sound a little better. So the choice of David Byrne was to evolve the band\u2019s sound a little bit.\u201d</p> <h2>Trism <br>(from Whammy!, 1983)</h2> <p>By 1983, a certain idea about the B-52s had become cemented. \u201c\u2018Wacky\u2019 was the word people used. We were perceived as a really silly, campy, wacky band. And that was hard. I love to read British critics, but one of them \u2013 I will never forget \u2013 said: \u2018They will not push their American trash aesthetic on us.\u2019 That\u2019s pretty much how it was seen: an American trash aesthetic, a band that were really, really silly. But we had a lot of very deep thoughts.\u201d It seems remarkable now, given that you can make a strong case for the B-52s as the parents of pop music\u2019s embrace of retro-futurism. \u201cWe were too much in the future,\u201d Pierson says, laughing. \u201cWe were future-futurists.\u201d</p> <p>Take Trism. \u201cFred thought of the trism: a time machine, like the Star Trek \u2018beam me up\u2019. There\u2019s a line in there \u2013 \u2018You gotta go by trism\u2019 \u2013 and I don\u2019t know if anyone knew what the hell we were talking about. But I love that song because, like a lot of our songs, there\u2019s no real chorus. Every part of it is different. Cindy and I have a real weird harmony, and it\u2019s so quintessentially B-52s, but it\u2019s one of those songs we don\u2019t really do live. It\u2019s one of the hidden gems to me that I still treasure hearing because I haven\u2019t heard it very much.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"68cc55c0846fe3b2a45185daca4553bfea0f397e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68cc55c0846fe3b2a45185daca4553bfea0f397e/0_0_3818_2580/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The B-52s.

One day he didn\u2019t show up for rehearsal. Keith called me the next day, and said, \u2018Ricky\u2019s in the hospital and he might die.\u2019 It was the most shocking thing. It seemed as though we, particularly Cindy, would never get over it. Looking back, we were in denial. We thought something was wrong, but we never dreamed he would suddenly die.\u201d</p> <p>It was Strickland who brought the band back together. He switched from drums to guitar, learning to play in Wilson\u2019s style. \u201cHe was the catalyst. It was a healing thing. We felt that, in honour of Ricky, we had to do this.</p> <p>\u201cThe title of Love Shack was Fred\u2019s idea, though some of the lines in the song [are about] my place that I lived in for $15 a month, in the middle of a field with goats. But Fred was thinking of this place called the Hawaiian Ha-Le \u2013 a juke joint out in the country, primarily African American but students would go there, and it would play great soul music. I think of the place in the movie The Color Purple, one of those country juke joints. It\u2019s a fictitious place, but the whole idea is that everyone\u2019s welcome to the party.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SOryJvTAGs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9SOryJvTAGs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>Deadbeat Club <br>(from Cosmic Thing, 1989)</h2> <p>The B-52s honoured their Athenian past in Deadbeat Club, remembering the time before they were famous, when they either had deadbeat jobs or no jobs \u2013 hence the title \u2013 and would live the lives of art students. \u201cIt\u2019s very nostalgic, and it\u2019s about things that really happened. We had a going-away party for our friend Robert Waldrop: a silent party. We met in this garden and it was silent. It was raining, and we had sheets and blankets around us, and we were naked except for the sheets. We ran around him and swooped around him. Very art school-y, but we thought we were the first people to ever do that.\u201d</p> <h2>Cosmic Thing <br>(from Cosmic Thing, 1989)</h2> <p>Pierson says the title track of Cosmic Thing \u201cencapsulates the record. Half the album is very bittersweet, but Cosmic Thing is the forward-thinking song, and it\u2019s political.\u201d Cosmic Thing lifted the B-52s into proper fame. The singles Love Shack and Roam were hits pretty much all around the world. Everywhere except Japan \u2013 a failure Pierson attributes to their name. Although the band\u2019s name refers to a beehive hairdo, the hairstyle is in turn named after American bomber aircraft.</p> <p>With a big hit album came 18 months of solid touring. \u201cWhen you tour that long, you come back home and new buildings have been built in the meantime, and you feel like you\u2019re in the rock\u2019n\u2019roll army,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were insulated, with each other, on this tour. So I don\u2019t think we had time to live the life of pop stars. We were on the bus. We partied with each other \u2013 we had some epic bus parties, and the bus driver created a dance called the Bore Hog. We would do our concert then get on the bus and keep rolling. It was a wild ride though. We were tired of being this underground band \u2013 this was a confirmation of something.\u201d</p> <h2>Roam <br>(from Cosmic Thing, 1989)</h2> <p>The recording of Bouncing Off the Satellites had been a difficult and dislocated process, \u201cbecause Ricky was sick \u2013 he just couldn\u2019t handle all the group jamming. It was fragmented, and I felt alienated, as I think Fred did, too.\u201d Cosmic Thing reunified the band. \u201cIt felt great coming together, even though Ricky was missing. We felt like, wow, there\u2019s some part of him that\u2019s still there with us, and it was healing.\u201d</p> <p>His absence, though, became apparent when the group began touring. \u201cCindy would sometimes look over on stage and see a phantom Ricky.\u201d All the time on the road, thankfully, did not cause ructions in the group, as can be the case. \u201cWe\u2019re still friends, which is a miracle after 40 years of touring. We\u2019ve taken a lot of breaks too, and we haven\u2019t made that many records, so we\u2019ve taken the pressure off. We\u2019re friends enough to give each other space, and we know what pushes each others\u2019 buttons. So we try not to go there. It\u2019s like those families where it\u2019s dysfunctional and sometimes it\u2019s better not to say things. But we still hang out together, and we eat together and party together. That\u2019s kind of miraculous, that we love each other.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"402ae33bc600170d34d350b61f32758450b84550\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/402ae33bc600170d34d350b61f32758450b84550/0_0_5436_4080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The B-52s around the time of 2008 album Funplex.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"751\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We still hang out together, we still love each other\u2019 \u2026 the B-52s around the time of 2008 album Funplex.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image from music company</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Juliet of the Spirits <br>(from Funplex, 2008)</h2> <p>The most recent B-52s album brought them back to one of their earliest inspirations: the director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/federico-fellini\">Federico Fellini</a>. Not only did they adore Nino Rota\u2019s scores for Fellini\u2019s films, they had considered calling themselves Fellini\u2019s Children before settling on the B-52s. \u201cWe actually wrote to Fellini to see if he would do a video. He politely declined. We were so influenced by him, and the Deadbeat Club video was very influenced by his film Juliet of the Spirits. And this song came directly from the movie. We all contributed to it. Keith had the idea of doing a song as a tribute to Juliet. And it\u2019s a very empowering woman\u2019s song. I feel it should have been as big a hit as Roam, because it really has power to it.\u201d</p> <p>Might it be said that the B-52s \u2013 placing women front and centre, and not merely as objects for the male gaze \u2013 were a key feminist group? \u201cCindy and I, from the beginning, did not dress for beauty. We wore crazy wigs and crazy outfits. So we were never trying to be glamourpusses. But we didn\u2019t have a leader and we all contributed equally.\u201d She laughs. \u201cI\u2019m happy if anyone wants to think of me as eye candy nowadays.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The B-52s are currently touring North America, until 24 September.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/user/guardianmusic/playlist/4Q4bfnlS25tc8gUIgEqtsK?si=cDm--sA3RIqodFXFfn4ZTA\">  <iframe height=\"380\" width=\"300\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/4Q4bfnlS25tc8gUIgEqtsK\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 16 July 2019.

Rock Lobster (from The B-52\u2019s, 1979) The B-52s (they dropped the apostrophe in 2008) came together in Athens, Georgia, before it was known as a music town.

It\u2019s one of the hidden gems to me that I still treasure hearing because I haven\u2019t heard it very much.\u201d Love Shack (from Cosmic Thing, 1989) Before the 1986 album Bouncing Off the Satellites was released, Ricky Wilson died of Aids-related illness, having kept his illness secret from all of his bandmates except Strickland until just before his death. \u201cWe saw Ricky get thin and asked, \u2018Are you OK?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Oh, I stopped eating Mexican food.\u2019 He loved Mexican food. One day he didn\u2019t show up for rehearsal. Keith called me the next day, and said, \u2018Ricky\u2019s in the hospital and he might die.\u2019 It was the most shocking thing. It seemed as though we, particularly Cindy, would never get over it. Looking back, we were in denial. We thought something was wrong, but we never dreamed he would suddenly die.\u201d It was Strickland who brought the band back together. He switched from drums to guitar, learning to play in Wilson\u2019s style. \u201cHe was the catalyst. It was a healing thing. We felt that, in honour of Ricky, we had to do this. \u201cThe title of Love Shack was Fred\u2019s idea, though some of the lines in the song [are about] my place that I lived in for $15 a month, in the middle of a field with goats. But Fred was thinking of this place called the Hawaiian Ha-Le \u2013 a juke joint out in the country, primarily African American but students would go there, and it would play great soul music. I think of the place in the movie The Color Purple, one of those country juke joints. It\u2019s a fictitious place, but the whole idea is that everyone\u2019s welcome to the party.\u201d Deadbeat Club (from Cosmic Thing, 1989) The B-52s honoured their Athenian past in Deadbeat Club, remembering the time before they were famous, when they either had deadbeat jobs or no jobs \u2013 hence the title \u2013 and would live the lives of art students. \u201cIt\u2019s very nostalgic, and it\u2019s about things that really happened. We had a going-away party for our friend Robert Waldrop: a silent party. We met in this garden and it was silent. It was raining, and we had sheets and blankets around us, and we were naked except for the sheets. We ran around him and swooped around him. Very art school-y, but we thought we were the first people to ever do that.\u201d Cosmic Thing (from Cosmic Thing, 1989) Pierson says the title track of Cosmic Thing \u201cencapsulates the record. Half the album is very bittersweet, but Cosmic Thing is the forward-thinking song, and it\u2019s political.\u201d Cosmic Thing lifted the B-52s into proper fame. The singles Love Shack and Roam were hits pretty much all around the world. Everywhere except Japan \u2013 a failure Pierson attributes to their name. Although the band\u2019s name refers to a beehive hairdo, the hairstyle is in turn named after American bomber aircraft. With a big hit album came 18 months of solid touring. \u201cWhen you tour that long, you come back home and new buildings have been built in the meantime, and you feel like you\u2019re in the rock\u2019n\u2019roll army,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were insulated, with each other, on this tour. So I don\u2019t think we had time to live the life of pop stars. We were on the bus. We partied with each other \u2013 we had some epic bus parties, and the bus driver created a dance called the Bore Hog. We would do our concert then get on the bus and keep rolling. It was a wild ride though. We were tired of being this underground band \u2013 this was a confirmation of something.\u201d Roam (from Cosmic Thing, 1989) The recording of Bouncing Off the Satellites had been a difficult and dislocated process, \u201cbecause Ricky was sick \u2013 he just couldn\u2019t handle all the group jamming. It was fragmented, and I felt alienated, as I think Fred did, too.\u201d Cosmic Thing reunified the band. \u201cIt felt great coming together, even though Ricky was missing. We felt like, wow, there\u2019s some part of him that\u2019s still there with us, and it was healing.\u201d His absence, though, became apparent when the group began touring. \u201cCindy would sometimes look over on stage and see a phantom Ricky.\u201d All the time on the road, thankfully, did not cause ructions in the group, as can be the case. \u201cWe\u2019re still friends, which is a miracle after 40 years of touring. We\u2019ve taken a lot of breaks too, and we haven\u2019t made that many records, so we\u2019ve taken the pressure off. We\u2019re friends enough to give each other space, and we know what pushes each others\u2019 buttons. So we try not to go there. It\u2019s like those families where it\u2019s dysfunctional and sometimes it\u2019s better not to say things. But we still hang out together, and we eat together and party together. That\u2019s kind of miraculous, that we love each other.\u201d Juliet of the Spirits (from Funplex, 2008) The most recent B-52s album brought them back to one of their earliest inspirations: the director Federico Fellini. Not only did they adore Nino Rota\u2019s scores for Fellini\u2019s films, they had considered calling themselves Fellini\u2019s Children before settling on the B-52s. \u201cWe actually wrote to Fellini to see if he would do a video. He politely declined. We were so influenced by him, and the Deadbeat Club video was very influenced by his film Juliet of the Spirits. And this song came directly from the movie. We all contributed to it. Keith had the idea of doing a song as a tribute to Juliet. And it\u2019s a very empowering woman\u2019s song. I feel it should have been as big a hit as Roam, because it really has power to it.\u201d Might it be said that the B-52s \u2013 placing women front and centre, and not merely as objects for the male gaze \u2013 were a key feminist group? \u201cCindy and I, from the beginning, did not dress for beauty. We wore crazy wigs and crazy outfits. So we were never trying to be glamourpusses. But we didn\u2019t have a leader and we all contributed equally.\u201d She laughs. \u201cI\u2019m happy if anyone wants to think of me as eye candy nowadays.\u201d \u2022 The B-52s are currently touring North America, until 24 September. \u2022 This article was amended on 16 July 2019. An earlier version incorrectly referred B-52 bomber aircraft being used in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This has been corrected.",

      "bodyText": "Starting from the first decently warm day of spring, green spaces across the city fill up with picnickers, p\u00e9tanque players, and hammockers. Huge murals from world-renowned street artists are splashed up and down Boulevard Saint-Laurent every June, while Place des Festivals lights up with glowing, interactive art installations in winter and musical swings in summer. And of course, there\u2019s the year-round smattering of festivals, highlighting everything from documentary films to up-and-coming music acts to stand-up comedy. The best way to get to know Montreal\u2019s energy and charm is on foot or by bike (if it\u2019s above freezing, at least), winding through its neighbourhoods and streets. \u2018Montreal is great for biking! It\u2019s a great way to explore beyond the mains, to find hidden gems, see the green alleyways, and hop from one neighbourhood to another.\u2019 Anne-Marie Pellerin, @am.pellerin, co-founder, Spade &amp; Palacio tours Street art in Boulevard Saint-Laurent; the Old Port Downtown and Old Montreal Downtown is the perfect starting point to discover the traditions and architecture of this vibrant city. And while Old Montreal, with its cobblestone streets and 17th- and 18th-century buildings, evokes the city\u2019s old-world charm, the area has also gained a hipper edge in recent years, thanks to additions such as Lov, a chic, creative vegan and vegetarian restaurant, and Unibar, a tucked-away classic burger spot specialising in natural wines. The Old Port area, overlooking the St Lawrence River, is also an outdoor event hotspot, home to poutine fests, winter electronic music events, and views of summer fireworks. \u2018Poutine is our dish, we\u2019re known worldwide for it. I like the Orange Julep, it\u2019s an iconic landmark in Montreal and their poutine is really exceptional. La Banquise is open 24 hours, but it doesn\u2019t matter what time of the day you go, there\u2019s always a line-up.\u2019 Eric Branover, @ericbranover, photographer Bar Le Mal N\u00e9cessaire The sprawling downtown includes major cultural venues such as the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts and Mus\u00e9e d\u2019art contemporain de Montr\u00e9al (Mac), both of which offer discounted admission on Wednesday nights and the chance to rub shoulders with locals. You can dig into dumplings, hand-pulled noodles, or Mongolian hotpot in the city\u2019s original Chinatown, marked by ornate paifang gates, or explore the smattering of small, often-packed restaurants in the city\u2019s \u201cSecond Chinatown\u201d around Concordia University.

      "body": "<p>There exists no purer evocation of childhood than the skipping rope. A rope, two handles, hours of fun. Of course, adults have a way of taking the same ingredients and making them far less innocent. Which possibly explains the Tangram Smart Rope (\u00a379.95, apple.com/uk): an \u201cLED-embedded jump rope that displays your fitness data in mid-air\u201d. Why? Does anyone really need an electronic skipping rope that has its own app? Surely this is the definition of flashiness for the sake of it?</p> <p>I put on my special shorts and get swinging, to see if such monstrosity can be defended. There is a good chance it can. While totally unnecessary, the image of a virtual counter racking up rope turns in mid-air is striking. And, as we know, coolness is infuriatingly self-justifying.</p> <p>But it is important not to fall into a nostalgia trap \u2013 exalting our childhood games and the way we played them. Remember how Father would smuggle a piece of coal home? We would pretend it was a mighty horse, taking turns to ride its dusty back! Ahhhh. But, no. Nostalgia is merely sandpaper that rubs jagged memories smooth. Things aren\u2019t necessarily better for belonging to our past.</p> <p>Jump ropes don\u2019t belong to my past, in any case. When I was young, skipping was for six-year-old girls in school playgrounds and 26-year-old men in boxing clubs, and I couldn\u2019t relate to either. Now absent of such hangups, I\u2019m interested, but inexperienced. Perhaps the Tangram Smart Rope can show me the ropes, 2019-style.</p> <p>The model I am testing is certainly a semi-handsome thing. Brushed metal handles in cherry red are topped with low-friction bearings, allowing free rotation of the matte-black rubber cable. The look is thrillingly reminiscent of a child\u2019s first nunchaku. I feel like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle, albeit one who didn\u2019t make the final cut. (Vel\u00e1zquez, the Pete Best of hero amphibians! Swinging his light-up rope with frictionless bearings!) None of this is bad. Trying to get into the groove, however, I\u2019m frustrated.</p> <p>The central section of the rope is reinforced and inflexible, to protect the row of LEDs inside, and, as a result, it has a different density and feel. Moreover, the join between the cable and LED strip segments the rope, which impacts on the swinging of it. The thicker section is burdensome, and thuds when it slaps against the floor. It also increases resistance, making it hard to get a good rhythm going. Arguably, the heavier rope increases its fitness potential, requiring greater exertion to rotate. But it\u2019s a drag, dude.</p> <p>The linked Tangram app is fine, and reliably counts the swings and also has a stab at estimating the number of calories burned. But the chief selling point of this model \u2013 the mid-air running counter \u2013 severely disappoints. The CGI on the box pictures a fitness model with a high number (2016 and rising) hovering before her at chest level, like the projection of a digital alarm clock.</p> <p>When I try it, the lights stay largely dark, erratically bursting into life for a few rotations before disappearing again. My pathetic figure (\u201c0006\u201d) is barely legible, like a fugitive firefly flashing on the ground, around my knees, above my head. It is strangely beautiful, this breathless grasping at phantasms. In fact, the rope could be a metaphor for life itself. But it would be more useful if it worked.</p> <p>This whole business of trying to spot and then interpret the flashes of light is unnecessarily stressful. It may sound odd to wish for exercise that was more relaxing, but the joy of skipping is a zen-like emptiness of repetition. When you are not in the zone, you are forced to remember that skipping is insanely, brutally hard work on the calves, glutes and lats. Maximum respect to six-year-old girls. After 15 seconds, my legs are aching, my stomach is complaining \u2013 and I have to skip to my loo, my darling.</p> <p>I try a few more times over several days and my stamina improves, but the LED functionality never does. An analogue rope wouldn\u2019t let you down like this. Turns out this update on a classic is not flashy enough. Smart Rope thinks it\u2019s too cool for school; really it needs to work smarter, not harder.</p> <h2><strong>Licen</strong><strong>ce to be ill. Very ill</strong></h2> <p>I eventually reached 0007, which is the closest I\u2019ll get to Daniel Craig levels of fitness.</p> <h2><strong>Wellness or hellness?</strong></h2> <p>I\u2019d rather pay money for old rope. <strong>1/5</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "There exists no purer evocation of childhood than the skipping rope. A rope, two handles, hours of fun. Of course, adults have a way of taking the same ingredients and making them far less innocent. Which possibly explains the Tangram Smart Rope (\u00a379.95, apple.com/uk): an \u201cLED-embedded jump rope that displays your fitness data in mid-air\u201d. Why? Does anyone really need an electronic skipping rope that has its own app? Surely this is the definition of flashiness for the sake of it? I put on my special shorts and get swinging, to see if such monstrosity can be defended. There is a good chance it can. While totally unnecessary, the image of a virtual counter racking up rope turns in mid-air is striking. And, as we know, coolness is infuriatingly self-justifying. But it is important not to fall into a nostalgia trap \u2013 exalting our childhood games and the way we played them. Remember how Father would smuggle a piece of coal home? We would pretend it was a mighty horse, taking turns to ride its dusty back! Ahhhh. But, no. Nostalgia is merely sandpaper that rubs jagged memories smooth. Things aren\u2019t necessarily better for belonging to our past. Jump ropes don\u2019t belong to my past, in any case. When I was young, skipping was for six-year-old girls in school playgrounds and 26-year-old men in boxing clubs, and I couldn\u2019t relate to either. Now absent of such hangups, I\u2019m interested, but inexperienced. Perhaps the Tangram Smart Rope can show me the ropes, 2019-style. The model I am testing is certainly a semi-handsome thing. Brushed metal handles in cherry red are topped with low-friction bearings, allowing free rotation of the matte-black rubber cable. The look is thrillingly reminiscent of a child\u2019s first nunchaku. I feel like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle, albeit one who didn\u2019t make the final cut. (Vel\u00e1zquez, the Pete Best of hero amphibians! Swinging his light-up rope with frictionless bearings!) None of this is bad. Trying to get into the groove, however, I\u2019m frustrated. The central section of the rope is reinforced and inflexible, to protect the row of LEDs inside, and, as a result, it has a different density and feel. Moreover, the join between the cable and LED strip segments the rope, which impacts on the swinging of it. The thicker section is burdensome, and thuds when it slaps against the floor. It also increases resistance, making it hard to get a good rhythm going. Arguably, the heavier rope increases its fitness potential, requiring greater exertion to rotate. But it\u2019s a drag, dude. The linked Tangram app is fine, and reliably counts the swings and also has a stab at estimating the number of calories burned. But the chief selling point of this model \u2013 the mid-air running counter \u2013 severely disappoints. The CGI on the box pictures a fitness model with a high number (2016 and rising) hovering before her at chest level, like the projection of a digital alarm clock. When I try it, the lights stay largely dark, erratically bursting into life for a few rotations before disappearing again. My pathetic figure (\u201c0006\u201d) is barely legible, like a fugitive firefly flashing on the ground, around my knees, above my head. It is strangely beautiful, this breathless grasping at phantasms. In fact, the rope could be a metaphor for life itself. But it would be more useful if it worked. This whole business of trying to spot and then interpret the flashes of light is unnecessarily stressful. It may sound odd to wish for exercise that was more relaxing, but the joy of skipping is a zen-like emptiness of repetition. When you are not in the zone, you are forced to remember that skipping is insanely, brutally hard work on the calves, glutes and lats. Maximum respect to six-year-old girls. After 15 seconds, my legs are aching, my stomach is complaining \u2013 and I have to skip to my loo, my darling. I try a few more times over several days and my stamina improves, but the LED functionality never does. An analogue rope wouldn\u2019t let you down like this. Turns out this update on a classic is not flashy enough. Smart Rope thinks it\u2019s too cool for school; really it needs to work smarter, not harder. Licence to be ill. Very ill I eventually reached 0007, which is the closest I\u2019ll get to Daniel Craig levels of fitness. Wellness or hellness? I\u2019d rather pay money for old rope. 1/5",

We are engaging with business across the capital and would urge anyone who becomes aware of protests taking place on their premises to contact police at the earliest opportunity.\u201d The London protests finished on Tuesday afternoon when the activists headed back to their temporary camp near Waterloo station. The concrete works is intended to support the construction of the Silvertown tunnel, a \u00a31bn toll road under the Thames. The project \u2013 backed by the London mayor, Sadiq Khan \u2013 has drawn widespread criticism from environmentalists, local politicians and others concerned about deadly air pollution in the capital. Campaigners say a major road-building project of this kind is at odds with efforts to tackle London\u2019s toxic air and reduce car use. They say it undermines the mayor\u2019s efforts to promote the city as a global environmental leader. Extinction Rebellion said Tuesday\u2019s protestwas intended to highlight the project\u2019s impact on residents\u2019 health. Eleanor McAree, 25, an activist from Tower Hamlets in east London, said: \u201cConcrete has a huge environmental impact and building another tunnel will only make air pollution across east London worse. \u201cThe air pollution is already at dangerous levels and is affecting the health of children and adults in the area. With the siting of this industry right next to two schools, these children face a lifelong negative impact on their health.\u201d According to recent data from the London Atmospheric Emission Inventory, 2 million people in the capital are living with illegal levels of air pollution. Although total nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions fell by 9% between 2013 and 2016, the number of primary schools in illegally polluted areas has barely changed in the same period, going from 371 to 369. The number of secondary schools affected rose from 81 to 86, according to City Hall. The Extinction Rebellion protests in all five cities will continue until Friday.",

The paper argues that lower labour market fluidity \u201cmay have reduced workers\u2019 confidence and power in negotiations, and thus lowered the scope for rent sharing\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cEqually, lower labour market fluidity could reflect decreased feelings of job security amongst workers due to globalisation and technological advancement.\u201d</p> <p>And here\u2019s why the paper is not all bad news for the labour movement: it acknowledges the power imbalance between employers and employees.</p> <p>The only reason changing employers works as a strategy to increase workers\u2019 pay is because their current employers are paying them below market rates.</p> <p>Unless an employer is preternaturally generous, they tend to hire employees by paying them as much as they have to to get the right person in the right job, and every year after they pay them as little as necessary to get them to stay.</p> <p>When you factor in perceptions of job insecurity and weighing the risk of possible future recession, it\u2019s rational that workers want to stay put. Deloitte Access Economics hinted at this last month when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/11/robots-wont-steal-your-jobs-but-that-fear-may-be-contributing-to-stagnant-wages-deloitte-says\">it argued robots are not stealing our jobs \u2013 but that fear may be contributing to wage stagnation</a>.</p> <p>By suggesting that switching jobs is a tool in the modern worker\u2019s arsenal to even out that power imbalance, the Treasury paper hints at the more obvious solution hiding in plain sight.</p> <p>Industrial action \u2013 including through the collective withdrawal of labour in the form of a strike \u2013 is more effective for a group of employees to gain a pay rise than one or two walking or threatening to walk to a competitor.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/15/economy-has-heaps-of-stimulus-but-rba-may-have-fired-too-many-bullets-warns-deloitte\">Economy has 'heaps of stimulus' but RBA may have fired too many bullets, warns Deloitte</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is curious the Treasury didn\u2019t study decreased union density or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2015/mar/16/industrial-action-is-at-near-record-lows-but-businesses-will-still-blame-unions\">the record low days lost to industrial activity</a> when it went looking for causes of wage stagnation.</p> <p>But what it did say is still revealing. Job switching works because every move realigns a worker\u2019s current pay with their actual market value.

      "bodyText": "Treasury caused consternation in the labour movement on Tuesday by suggesting the best way to win a pay rise might be to switch jobs. It looked to unions like an attempt to blame workers for their bosses\u2019 failure to grant a pay rise. But the discussion should not provoke outrage because the Treasury may just have handed unions their best argument yet for changing the rules around bargaining between employers and employees. Meghan Quinn, the deputy secretary of Treasury\u2019s macroeconomic group, told the Australian Conference of Economists in Melbourne about a new Treasury paper on the causes of Australia\u2019s wage stagnation. First, she said, there were the \u201cstandard\u201d causes: lower inflation and inflation expectations, slower productivity growth, high rates of participation and spare capacity in the labour market, and the end of the commodity price boom. Then Treasury went looking for other factors to explain the remaining wage growth weakness. The paper finds that \u201cmore frequent job switching is associated with higher real wage growth, even for those that stay in their job\u201d, Quinn said. \u201cThis research suggests that a 1 percentage point decrease in the job switching rate, for any given demographic or cyclical conditions, is roughly associated with a \u00bd percentage point decline in average wage growth.\u201d The fact the job-switching rate declined from 11% in the early 2000s to 8% today may therefore be to blame for today\u2019s slow wage growth. But why? The paper argues that lower labour market fluidity \u201cmay have reduced workers\u2019 confidence and power in negotiations, and thus lowered the scope for rent sharing\u201d. \u201cEqually, lower labour market fluidity could reflect decreased feelings of job security amongst workers due to globalisation and technological advancement.\u201d And here\u2019s why the paper is not all bad news for the labour movement: it acknowledges the power imbalance between employers and employees. The only reason changing employers works as a strategy to increase workers\u2019 pay is because their current employers are paying them below market rates. Unless an employer is preternaturally generous, they tend to hire employees by paying them as much as they have to to get the right person in the right job, and every year after they pay them as little as necessary to get them to stay. When you factor in perceptions of job insecurity and weighing the risk of possible future recession, it\u2019s rational that workers want to stay put. Deloitte Access Economics hinted at this last month when it argued robots are not stealing our jobs \u2013 but that fear may be contributing to wage stagnation. By suggesting that switching jobs is a tool in the modern worker\u2019s arsenal to even out that power imbalance, the Treasury paper hints at the more obvious solution hiding in plain sight. Industrial action \u2013 including through the collective withdrawal of labour in the form of a strike \u2013 is more effective for a group of employees to gain a pay rise than one or two walking or threatening to walk to a competitor. It is curious the Treasury didn\u2019t study decreased union density or the record low days lost to industrial activity when it went looking for causes of wage stagnation. But what it did say is still revealing. Job switching works because every move realigns a worker\u2019s current pay with their actual market value. Even those staying put benefit because the easier it is to make a move the more employers have to keep up with what others are paying. Unions should rise to the occasion to argue this paper tells us what we already know: employers will only pay more if forced to \u2013 and threatening a day off work will do just as well as threatening to leave for a competitor.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Silverstone delivers the goods</strong></h2> <p>With the signing of a new contract to host F1 for a further five years there was a celebratory air at Silverstone. That F1 had done the right thing was confirmed in spades on Sunday, when the old airfield <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/lewis-hamilton-wins-f1-british-grand-prix-record-sixth\" title=\"\">delivered a marvellous race</a>. The drivers revelled in it and the opportunity for genuine racing it affords. F1\u2019s problems in following closely have not gone away but they are negated on good tracks. Silverstone\u2019s layout encourages a fight and several of the corner sequences give drivers the chance to come back during an attempted pass which makes for compelling action. The previous race at Austria similarly facilitated proper racing. It is no coincidence these tracks repeatedly host a great spectacle. The three men on the podium \u2013 Lewis Hamilton, Valtteri Bottas and Charles Leclerc \u2013 were all in agreement: it was the circuits making the difference. Bottas was unusually and pleasingly blunt in identifying F1\u2019s real problem. \u201cIt\u2019s all about selection of the tracks,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure many of the track selections for the calendar are just pure political reasons and money, rather than focusing on whether it\u2019s good for racing or not.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/jul/15/f1-british-grand-prix-fans-silverstone\">Fervour of F1 fans shows British Grand Prix remains true to its roots | Yassmin Abdel-Magied</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Stewards shift positions</strong></h2> <p>Amid much great racing the best was highlighted by Leclerc\u2019s battle with Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen. The pair went wheel to wheel in a no-holds-barred scrap that was glorious. Almost from the off they went at it with fervour. It peaked as Leclerc attacked through the final corners just after halfway through the race, he went up the inside at Club and Verstappen went wide on to the run-off but ultimately held the place. Leclerc described it as his most enjoyable F1 race and Verstappen acknowledged the Monegasque had defended hard but said he was \u201call up for that\u201d. The stewards thankfully did not intervene, as they had chosen to take no action <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/30/max-verstappen-austrian-f1-gp-charles-leclerc\" title=\"\">when the pair clashed </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/30/max-verstappen-austrian-f1-gp-charles-leclerc\" title=\"\">in Austria</a>. It suggests there has been a genuine reconsideration of the parameters of interpreting the rules, with a gratifying swing towards letting hard but fair racing stand. This sets precedents both drivers have embraced wholeheartedly. The prospect of them going at one another for another decade is mouth watering.</p> <h2><strong>Verstappen finishes with flair</strong></h2> <p>For Verstappen unfortunately there was no great reward for his verve. He looked on to beat Bottas into second when he was putting Sebastian Vettel to the sword at Stowe. The Dutchman swept past him round the outside and the move was done when Vettel made an egregious error, failed to brake in time and punted into the back of the Red Bull. Verstappen\u2019s car went over the kerbs, was catapulted into the air and came down hard. Both Red Bull and Honda expected it to be game over. But he returned to the track and, remarkably brought it home for fifth. He revealed afterwards the power steering more or less failed, the seat was moving around, the floor was damaged, the diffuser broken and parts were falling off. Earlier in the weekend his former teammate Daniel Ricciardo had said that, without power steering, driving the cars would be \u201cimpossible\u201d. Verstappen managed it and more and emerged smiling at the end. The team principal, Christian Horner, described it as \u201cincredible\u201d and it was yet more evidence that when Verstappen is in a title fight he will be a formidable opponent.</p> <h2><strong>Vettel\u2019s form deserts him</strong></h2> <p>For Vettel the incident had absolutely no positives. Rather it was a spectacular misjudgment, his worst since he went off in the rain at Germany last year and appears indicative that he is foundering with a loss of form. Since his anger at being denied a victory he believed he deserved in Canada by a stewards decision, he has looked decidedly uninspired. He was sixth in qualifying at Silverstone and has not made the top five since Montreal. His error here was that he believed Verstappen was going to move to his right, opening space for him to attempt to comeback though Vale. But basing his braking on an assumption was a major mistake and not the decision of a driver performing at his peak. He admitted it was wholly his fault and apologised to Verstappen having taken a penalty and finished in 16th. A hundred points behind Hamilton, his title hopes are gone and it seems that, for the moment, so is his mojo. Rumours of early retirement already abound.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/lewis-hamilton-thanks-supporters-british-grand-prix\">Lewis Hamilton says British GP win is greatest moment for any home driver</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Haas farce</strong></h2> <p>As if the tawdry row between Rich Energy and Haas was not farcical enough, the team managed to compound it by shooting themselves in the foot as their drivers hit one another on the opening lap. With the energy drink title sponsor that signed up at the start of this season attempting to pull its sponsorship amid a series of tweets, claims and counter claims that ape the smoke and mirrors that cloak the company, Haas are now apparently attempting to recover \u00a335m from them for breach of contract. Rich Energy recently lost a copyright case over their use of the Whyte Bikes stag logo. Ordered to pay \u00a335,416 in costs, they have failed to do so and Whyte bikes are considering submitting applications to wind up Rich Energy and for the bankruptcy of its CEO, William Storey. In 2017 their financial registration at Companies House stated Rich Energy had \u00a3581 in the bank. Haas are not speaking publicly about the row, doubtless pending some legal intervention but the most overwhelming question they must address is just why they entered this disastrous partnership with a company that has faced endless questions about its legitimacy and whether they have in fact been paid a bean.</p>",

Silverstone\u2019s layout encourages a fight and several of the corner sequences give drivers the chance to come back during an attempted pass which makes for compelling action. The previous race at Austria similarly facilitated proper racing. It is no coincidence these tracks repeatedly host a great spectacle. The three men on the podium \u2013 Lewis Hamilton, Valtteri Bottas and Charles Leclerc \u2013 were all in agreement: it was the circuits making the difference. Bottas was unusually and pleasingly blunt in identifying F1\u2019s real problem. \u201cIt\u2019s all about selection of the tracks,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure many of the track selections for the calendar are just pure political reasons and money, rather than focusing on whether it\u2019s good for racing or not.\u201d Stewards shift positions Amid much great racing the best was highlighted by Leclerc\u2019s battle with Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen. The pair went wheel to wheel in a no-holds-barred scrap that was glorious. Almost from the off they went at it with fervour. It peaked as Leclerc attacked through the final corners just after halfway through the race, he went up the inside at Club and Verstappen went wide on to the run-off but ultimately held the place. Leclerc described it as his most enjoyable F1 race and Verstappen acknowledged the Monegasque had defended hard but said he was \u201call up for that\u201d. The stewards thankfully did not intervene, as they had chosen to take no action when the pair clashed in Austria. It suggests there has been a genuine reconsideration of the parameters of interpreting the rules, with a gratifying swing towards letting hard but fair racing stand. This sets precedents both drivers have embraced wholeheartedly. The prospect of them going at one another for another decade is mouth watering. Verstappen finishes with flair For Verstappen unfortunately there was no great reward for his verve. He looked on to beat Bottas into second when he was putting Sebastian Vettel to the sword at Stowe. The Dutchman swept past him round the outside and the move was done when Vettel made an egregious error, failed to brake in time and punted into the back of the Red Bull. Verstappen\u2019s car went over the kerbs, was catapulted into the air and came down hard. Both Red Bull and Honda expected it to be game over. But he returned to the track and, remarkably brought it home for fifth. He revealed afterwards the power steering more or less failed, the seat was moving around, the floor was damaged, the diffuser broken and parts were falling off. Earlier in the weekend his former teammate Daniel Ricciardo had said that, without power steering, driving the cars would be \u201cimpossible\u201d. Verstappen managed it and more and emerged smiling at the end. The team principal, Christian Horner, described it as \u201cincredible\u201d and it was yet more evidence that when Verstappen is in a title fight he will be a formidable opponent. Vettel\u2019s form deserts him For Vettel the incident had absolutely no positives. Rather it was a spectacular misjudgment, his worst since he went off in the rain at Germany last year and appears indicative that he is foundering with a loss of form. Since his anger at being denied a victory he believed he deserved in Canada by a stewards decision, he has looked decidedly uninspired. He was sixth in qualifying at Silverstone and has not made the top five since Montreal. His error here was that he believed Verstappen was going to move to his right, opening space for him to attempt to comeback though Vale. But basing his braking on an assumption was a major mistake and not the decision of a driver performing at his peak. He admitted it was wholly his fault and apologised to Verstappen having taken a penalty and finished in 16th. A hundred points behind Hamilton, his title hopes are gone and it seems that, for the moment, so is his mojo. Rumours of early retirement already abound. Haas farce As if the tawdry row between Rich Energy and Haas was not farcical enough, the team managed to compound it by shooting themselves in the foot as their drivers hit one another on the opening lap. With the energy drink title sponsor that signed up at the start of this season attempting to pull its sponsorship amid a series of tweets, claims and counter claims that ape the smoke and mirrors that cloak the company, Haas are now apparently attempting to recover \u00a335m from them for breach of contract. Rich Energy recently lost a copyright case over their use of the Whyte Bikes stag logo. Ordered to pay \u00a335,416 in costs, they have failed to do so and Whyte bikes are considering submitting applications to wind up Rich Energy and for the bankruptcy of its CEO, William Storey. In 2017 their financial registration at Companies House stated Rich Energy had \u00a3581 in the bank. Haas are not speaking publicly about the row, doubtless pending some legal intervention but the most overwhelming question they must address is just why they entered this disastrous partnership with a company that has faced endless questions about its legitimacy and whether they have in fact been paid a bean.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s <strong>Gareth Bale</strong>\u2019s birthday and among the popping corks and sounds of party horns being blown there is also talk of happy returns, chiefly a move back to <strong>Tottenham Hotspur</strong>, the club that helped transform Bale from a skinny, injury-prone sickly left-back into a goal-guzzling, thunderous inside-forward. With Zinedine Zidane having placed Bale on a dusty shelf in a Real Madrid closet, Spurs have offered to refresh the Bernab\u00e9u coffers with \u00a354m and then let off a few party poppers if they bring the 30-year-old back to N17. There is a snag, though. It says here Bale earns around \u00a3600,000 a week through wages and endorsements at Real and Spurs could, at best, match half of that. So while Bale would appreciate a nice cake and a birthday knees-up in north London, he\u2019d expect much greater gifts landing in his bank account each week to play football there. He\u2019s pooped his own party.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/15/west-ham-sebastian-heller-eintracht-frankfurt-transfer-window\">West Ham optimistic S\u00e9bastien Haller will join from Eintracht Frankfurt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Spurs have their eye on another physically imposing inside-forward, in any case. With <strong>Roma</strong> having sent Franco Baldini to London for talks over signing <strong>Toby Alderweireld</strong>, Mauricio Pochettino has made it clear he wants the 20-year-old <strong>Nicol\u00f2 Zaniolo</strong> to be sent to Spurs as part of the deal. Pochettino is trying to beef up his squad with a few big lads before the new season and the Italian ticks all the right boxes \u2013 he\u2019s a whopping 6ft 3in tall and has a left foot like an anvil.</p> <p>For the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/08/psg-statement-neymar-misses-training-brazil\">second time in a week</a>, football-playing brand <strong>Neymar</strong> has told PSG that he doesn\u2019t want to be there. His body language has said as much for the past 12 months so he needn\u2019t have wasted his breath. But with Barcelona having just splashed out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/12/antoine-griezmann-joins-barcelona-from-atletico-madrid-for-120m\">\u00a3107m on Antoine Griezmann</a>, what options has he got? As Al Pacino said in Carlito\u2019s Way: \u201cWhen you can\u2019t see the angles no more, you\u2019re in trouble, baby, you\u2019re in trouble.\u201d</p> <p>Leicester have told <strong>Harry Maguire</strong> that he can leave but only if <strong>Manchester City</strong> or <strong>Manchester United</strong> pay more than \u00a375m for the modern-day Steve Bruce. Just let that sink in. As for the actual Steve Bruce, once Mike Ashley has removed the moths from his wallet, he\u2019ll take out \u00a34m and send it to Sheffield Wednesday as compensation for nabbing their manager and installing him in the <strong>Newcastle</strong> hot seat.</p> <p>Celtic have told <strong>Arsenal </strong>they will have to pay more than \u00a325m for the rampaging left-back <strong>Kieran Tierney</strong> but the Gunners are adamant that they are not going to lick their fingers and peel off any more notes. Perhaps the reason they won\u2019t go any higher is because they want to keep \u00a325m spare for <strong>Everton</strong>, whose zippy displays for Brazil on the way to winning the Copa Am\u00e9rica made Unai Emery feel hot under the collar. The Gr\u00eamio forward is still considered more likely to join Milan, though. Meanwhile, in rather bizarre news, the Ajax technical director, Marc Overmars, has told his former club they should flog Mesut \u00d6zil and buy <strong>Hakim Ziyech</strong> for \u00a331.5m. \u201cI think Hakim Ziyech is better than Mesut \u00d6zil. I would say sell him [\u00d6zil] and you will get Hakim for half. But they [Arsenal] didn\u2019t listen to me. So it could just be that he stays with Ajax.\u201d Whether he\u2019s auditioning for the job of Arsenal sporting director or just wilfully trying to upset his employers is unclear. It\u2019s rather amusing, though. Overmars also said that <strong>Juventus</strong> are <em>this</em> close to completing the signing of <strong>Matthijs de Ligt</strong>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elsewhere, <strong>Aston Villa</strong> are on the verge of signing <strong>Marvelous Nakamba</strong> from Club Brugge (Villa fans, get working on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLhYF4tTRAE\">this Lightning Seeds song</a>, now), <strong>Jean Micha\u00ebl Seri</strong> looks to be heading out of the <strong>Fulham</strong> exit door for <strong>Galatasaray </strong>or <strong>Milan, Wolves</strong> want<strong> Wallace </strong>from <strong>Lazio</strong> and the <strong>Bundesliga</strong> is bracing itself for the arrival of Chuckles.<strong> </strong>Yes, <strong>Jos\u00e9 Mourinho</strong> wants to work in Germany. <strong>Oh</strong>, and <strong>Philippe Coutinho</strong> has been making encouraging noises about a possible return to <strong>Liverpool</strong> on a two-year loan deal.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s Gareth Bale\u2019s birthday and among the popping corks and sounds of party horns being blown there is also talk of happy returns, chiefly a move back to Tottenham Hotspur, the club that helped transform Bale from a skinny, injury-prone sickly left-back into a goal-guzzling, thunderous inside-forward. With Zinedine Zidane having placed Bale on a dusty shelf in a Real Madrid closet, Spurs have offered to refresh the Bernab\u00e9u coffers with \u00a354m and then let off a few party poppers if they bring the 30-year-old back to N17. There is a snag, though. It says here Bale earns around \u00a3600,000 a week through wages and endorsements at Real and Spurs could, at best, match half of that. So while Bale would appreciate a nice cake and a birthday knees-up in north London, he\u2019d expect much greater gifts landing in his bank account each week to play football there. He\u2019s pooped his own party. Spurs have their eye on another physically imposing inside-forward, in any case. With Roma having sent Franco Baldini to London for talks over signing Toby Alderweireld, Mauricio Pochettino has made it clear he wants the 20-year-old Nicol\u00f2 Zaniolo to be sent to Spurs as part of the deal. Pochettino is trying to beef up his squad with a few big lads before the new season and the Italian ticks all the right boxes \u2013 he\u2019s a whopping 6ft 3in tall and has a left foot like an anvil. For the second time in a week, football-playing brand Neymar has told PSG that he doesn\u2019t want to be there. His body language has said as much for the past 12 months so he needn\u2019t have wasted his breath. But with Barcelona having just splashed out \u00a3107m on Antoine Griezmann, what options has he got? As Al Pacino said in Carlito\u2019s Way: \u201cWhen you can\u2019t see the angles no more, you\u2019re in trouble, baby, you\u2019re in trouble.\u201d Leicester have told Harry Maguire that he can leave but only if Manchester City or Manchester United pay more than \u00a375m for the modern-day Steve Bruce. Just let that sink in. As for the actual Steve Bruce, once Mike Ashley has removed the moths from his wallet, he\u2019ll take out \u00a34m and send it to Sheffield Wednesday as compensation for nabbing their manager and installing him in the Newcastle hot seat. Celtic have told Arsenal they will have to pay more than \u00a325m for the rampaging left-back Kieran Tierney but the Gunners are adamant that they are not going to lick their fingers and peel off any more notes. Perhaps the reason they won\u2019t go any higher is because they want to keep \u00a325m spare for Everton, whose zippy displays for Brazil on the way to winning the Copa Am\u00e9rica made Unai Emery feel hot under the collar. The Gr\u00eamio forward is still considered more likely to join Milan, though. Meanwhile, in rather bizarre news, the Ajax technical director, Marc Overmars, has told his former club they should flog Mesut \u00d6zil and buy Hakim Ziyech for \u00a331.5m. \u201cI think Hakim Ziyech is better than Mesut \u00d6zil. I would say sell him [\u00d6zil] and you will get Hakim for half. But they [Arsenal] didn\u2019t listen to me. So it could just be that he stays with Ajax.\u201d Whether he\u2019s auditioning for the job of Arsenal sporting director or just wilfully trying to upset his employers is unclear. It\u2019s rather amusing, though. Overmars also said that Juventus are this close to completing the signing of Matthijs de Ligt. Elsewhere, Aston Villa are on the verge of signing Marvelous Nakamba from Club Brugge (Villa fans, get working on this Lightning Seeds song, now), Jean Micha\u00ebl Seri looks to be heading out of the Fulham exit door for Galatasaray or Milan, Wolves want Wallace from Lazio and the Bundesliga is bracing itself for the arrival of Chuckles. Yes, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho wants to work in Germany. Oh, and Philippe Coutinho has been making encouraging noises about a possible return to Liverpool on a two-year loan deal.",

His political career took flight with his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/17/us/politics/donald-trump-obama-birther.html\">birtherism claims</a> that accused Barack Obama of being neither American nor Christian. He launched his campaign by <a href=\"https://time.com/3923128/donald-trump-announcement-speech/\">declaring</a> Mexicans drug-dealing rapists, and he promised \u2013 and attempted \u2013 to institute a ban on people from majority-Muslim countries entering the United States.

      "body": "<p><strong><br></strong>The Personal History of David Copperfield, Armando Iannucci\u2019s adaptation of the Charles Dickens classic, is to open this year\u2019s London film festival. The film will have its European premiere at the festival, indicating a world-first screening in Toronto at the start of September.</p> <p>The film is billed as a \u201cfresh take\u201d on Dickens\u2019 epic autobiographical tale of one young man\u2019s journey into adulthood, juggling his ambitions to become a writer with his conscience about poverty in Victorian London and his duty of care towards his eccentric aunt.</p> <p>Published in serial form between 1849-1850, the book, whose full title is The Personal History, Adventures, Experience and Observation of David Copperfield the Younger of Blunderstone Rookery (Which He Never Meant to Publish on Any Account) was described by Dickens as his personal favourite.</p> <p>Patel, who rose to fame in TV series Skins and as the lead in Danny Boyle\u2019s Slumdog Millionaire (2008), takes the leading role, with Swinton as his aunt, the donkey-chasing Betsey Trotwood, and Ben Whishaw as Uriah Heep \u2013 one of Dickens\u2019s most obsequious and most memorable characters.</p> <p>Peter Capaldi plays Mr Micawber, with Hugh Laurie as Mr Dick and Gwendoline Christie as Jane Murdstone. As well as directing, Iannucci has co-written the screenplay with frequent collaborator Simon Blackwell.</p> <p>Said Iannucci: <strong>\u201c</strong>It\u2019s a huge thrill and honour to be asked to open the fantastic BFI London film festival. The Personal History of David Copperfield is a film about compassion, humour, generosity and friendship, and I couldn\u2019t have asked for a more welcoming setting in which to premiere it.<strong>\u201d</strong></p> <p>Tricia Tuttle, the director of the festival, added that the film \u201cshows [Iannucci\u2019s] trademark wit and a joyous sense of style \u2013 it\u2019s a delight from start to finish, with Dev Patel and co-stars delivering performances of megawatt charm and comic flair.

      "bodyText": "The Personal History of David Copperfield, Armando Iannucci\u2019s adaptation of the Charles Dickens classic, is to open this year\u2019s London film festival. The film will have its European premiere at the festival, indicating a world-first screening in Toronto at the start of September. The film is billed as a \u201cfresh take\u201d on Dickens\u2019 epic autobiographical tale of one young man\u2019s journey into adulthood, juggling his ambitions to become a writer with his conscience about poverty in Victorian London and his duty of care towards his eccentric aunt. Published in serial form between 1849-1850, the book, whose full title is The Personal History, Adventures, Experience and Observation of David Copperfield the Younger of Blunderstone Rookery (Which He Never Meant to Publish on Any Account) was described by Dickens as his personal favourite. Patel, who rose to fame in TV series Skins and as the lead in Danny Boyle\u2019s Slumdog Millionaire (2008), takes the leading role, with Swinton as his aunt, the donkey-chasing Betsey Trotwood, and Ben Whishaw as Uriah Heep \u2013 one of Dickens\u2019s most obsequious and most memorable characters. Peter Capaldi plays Mr Micawber, with Hugh Laurie as Mr Dick and Gwendoline Christie as Jane Murdstone. As well as directing, Iannucci has co-written the screenplay with frequent collaborator Simon Blackwell. Said Iannucci: \u201cIt\u2019s a huge thrill and honour to be asked to open the fantastic BFI London film festival. The Personal History of David Copperfield is a film about compassion, humour, generosity and friendship, and I couldn\u2019t have asked for a more welcoming setting in which to premiere it.\u201d Tricia Tuttle, the director of the festival, added that the film \u201cshows [Iannucci\u2019s] trademark wit and a joyous sense of style \u2013 it\u2019s a delight from start to finish, with Dev Patel and co-stars delivering performances of megawatt charm and comic flair. I\u2019m so excited to be opening the 63rd BFI London film festival with this film which is not only wildly entertaining but also a timely celebration of the power of generosity and compassion.\u201d Iannucci\u2019s previous big-screen credits include In the Loop and The Death of Stalin. His long-running political comedy, Veep, recently concluded on HBO, while a forthcoming show, sci-fi satire Avenue 5, is currently in production. Last week the studio outside London where it is shooting suffered a fire, damaging some of the sets. David Copperfield has been made for film eight times previously, as well as three times for television, most recently on the BBC in 1999, starring a pre-Harry Potter Daniel Radcliffe. Patel\u2019s hire \u2013 along with that of fellow actors Benedict Wong, Rosalind Eleazar and Nikki Amuka-Bird, has already been applauded as a progressive step in colour-blind casting. \u201cArmando always knew he wanted Dev,\u201d the film\u2019s producer, Kevin Loader, told the Guardian. \u201cOnce you realise that, then you\u2019re making a statement about the fact that you\u2019re going to cast actors who are capable of embodying the character as perfectly as possible, regardless of their ethnicity.\u201d Steve McQueen\u2019s heist thriller Widows kicked off last year\u2019s festival, while the winner of the festival\u2019s top prize, the Michael Powell award, was Sudabeh Mortezai\u2019s sex-trafficking drama Joy.

      "bodyText": "Rescuers in Tasmania have found a missing bushwalker alive and well after his fourth night lost in the Tasmanian wilderness. Michael Bowman, 57, of Victoria, was hiking in the Lake St Clair region. Tasmanian police said the Westpac rescue helicopter was transporting him to the Royal Hobart hospital for a medical assessment as a precaution. Bowman had been expected to finish a walk at Lake St Clair visitor centre in the state\u2019s central highlands on Friday. The Bureau of Meteorology had warned he was at risk of hypothermia with cold temperatures and strong winds forecast on Tuesday night. Several bushwalkers have been rescued from the Cradle Mountain area in recent days, including a British man and Hobart school group from Dove Lake on Tuesday. A West Australian father and his daughter who became stranded by snow in the region two days ago were found safe and well. They were reached by a search party on Tuesday afternoon and were flown by helicopter to safety. Helicopter pilots are checking every hut on the popular Overland Track for bushwalkers who may be in trouble. Bushwalkers including a Brisbane man aged in his 40s also had to be rescued on Monday from the north-west end of Lake St Clair. Another two NSW hikers were plucked from the Walls of Jerusalem national park to the south earlier in the day. People are urged not to go bushwalking unless they are well-prepared for freezing weather. The temperature at Lake St Clair dropped to 2C overnight, with strong winds and rain expected to wash away the weekend snow dump. With Australian Associated Press",

      "bodyText": "Four Democratic congresswomen of color targeted by Donald Trump\u2019s racist attacks have accused the US president of following an \u201cagenda of white nationalists\u201d and asked that Americans \u201cdo not take the bait\u201d of his divisive rhetoric. In a joint press conference at the Capitol, the congresswomen spoke out after Trump said they should \u201cgo back\u201d to the \u201ccrime infested\u201d countries they came from, prompting condemnation in the US and across the world. Of the four, all are non-white and all except Ilhan Omar of Minnesota were born US citizens. Omar came to the US aged 12 as a refugee and took up American citizenship five years later. All are progressives within the Democratic party, and advocate for left-leaning policies. The women \u2013 Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts \u2013 called Trump\u2019s remarks a \u201cblatantly racist\u201d attack on elected leaders, and an attempt to distract from the corrupt and inhuman practices of his administration. \u201cThis is a disruptive distraction from the issues of care, concern and consequence to the American people that we were sent here with a decisive mandate from our constituents to work on,\u201d said Pressley, who was the first black woman elected to Congress from Massachusetts. \u201cThis is the agenda of white nationalists, whether it is happening in chat rooms, or it is happening on national TV, and now it is reached the White House garden,\u201d said Omar, who called this a \u201cpivotal moment in our country \u201c with the \u201ceyes of history\u201d watching. Listing vulgar comments Trump has made publicly and privately about women, people of color and African nations, Omar said he has \u201copenly violated the oath he took\u201d by allowing \u201chuman rights abuses\u201d at the US-Mexico border and of colluding with a foreign government during the 2016 presidential election, which Trump has denied. \u201cIt is time for us to stop allowing this president to make a mockery of our constitution,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is time to impeach this president.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez, who was born in the Bronx and is of Puerto Rican descent, said she was \u201cnot surprised\u201d by Trump\u2019s comments. \u201cThis president \u2026 does not know how to defend his policies and so what he does is attack us personally,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. Tlaib, the Detroit-born daughter of Palestinian immigrants, renewed her calls for Trump to be impeached for his \u201cutter disregard and disrespect of the United States constitution\u201d. \u201cSadly, this is not the first nor will it be the last time we hear disgusting, bigoted language from the president,\u201d Tlaib said. \u201cWe know this is who he is.\u201d But she stressed that she would continue to stay focused on the priorities that she believes her constituents want her to address, including the conditions at the US border, poverty in America and the expansion of access to healthcare. As the four women were speaking, Trump was live-tweeting his own caustic commentary. He implied that his provocative stance had forced the Democrats to embrace the congresswomen which in turn meant \u201cthey are endorsing Socialism, hate of Israel and the USA! Not good for the Democrats!\u201d The Democratic congresswomen spoke out at the end of an extraordinary 24 hours in which Trump doggedly dug himself deeper into the row over his xenophobic tirade that began on Sunday morning with a stream of unashamedly racist tweets. In them, the US president interjected himself uninvited into the middle of an argument that had been developing between the four progressive members of Congress and Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful Democrat on Capitol Hill. In his Twitter storm, Trump called on the four \u2013 who he did not name directly but clearly invoked \u2013 to \u201cgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came\u201d. The president\u2019s use of the \u201cgo back home\u201d racist trope led to an immediate and explosive response, with condemnation erupting across the US and around the world. Race-baiting has been a consistent theme of Trump\u2019s presidency \u2013 starting on the day he announced his presidential run in June 2015 when he accused Mexico of sending \u201crapists\u201d to the US as immigrants. Pelosi made clear her deep displeasure that Trump had chosen to interfere in her party\u2019s internal affairs in such poisonous terms, denouncing his comments as another manifestation of his desire to make \u201cAmerica white again\u201d. Pelosi announced on Monday that the House would move to formally condemn the president\u2019s \u201cxenophobic\u201d tweets about members of Congress with resolution. A number of Democratic candidates in the 2020 presidential race piled in. Joe Biden, the former vice-president who currently leads the Democratic field, slammed into Trump for continuing to \u201cspew hateful rhetoric, sow division, and stoke racial tensions for his own political gain\u201d.

He appeared only to be further energized by the global pounding he received, enthusiastically hurling himself at the dispute. In an indication of the divisive, us-against-them tactics Trump will run on in 2020, his re-election campaign seized on a comment by Omar to suggest that she was refusing to denounce the terrorist organization al-Qaida. Over the course of Monday Trump refused to back down \u2013 flinging the opprobrium he had come under over the previous 24 hours back in the faces of his critics. \u201cWhen will the Radical Left Congresswomen apologize to our country \u2026 for the foul language they have used, and the terrible things they have said,\u201d he tweeted.

But still only 49 of 154 institutions are likely to meet the target set by the former funding agency of a 43% reduction of carbon emissions between 2005 and 2020.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/green_uni-zip/giv-3902pmHEXOsh3k0x/\" data-alt=\"Top and bottom 10 rankings\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/green_uni-zip/giv-3902pmHEXOsh3k0x/\">Top and bottom 10 rankings</a> </figure>  <p>The table compiled by People and Planet, the student-led network, scores universities out of 100 on criteria such as environmental audits and management systems, the number of staff working on the issues, ethical investment, carbon management, waste and recycling, and sustainable food.</p> <p>The lack of progress is frustrating, says Hannah Smith, the network\u2019s co-director of campaigns and research. \u201cIt\u2019s abhorrent to watch universities fail on climate change at a time when people on the frontlines of the impacts are fighting back against heatwaves and forest fires. Universities have a duty to stand with those communities and their students on strike and use their privileged position to act,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Network member Steff Farley, 25, a maths postgraduate student at Loughborough University, adds: \u201cThe findings expose the dragging lack of willpower, vision and energy in the sector, which shows disregard for the young climate strikers at schools, colleges and at their own universities.\u201d</p> <p>The table shows that just eight universities have a policy to invest in renewable energy, says Emily Adams, 23, who is studying marine biology and oceanography at the University of Plymouth. \u201cOur universities must now step up to take action to fund a just climate transition,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>This year\u2019s findings on carbon reduction are all the more alarming because this could be the last we hear of them. Under the government\u2019s higher education reforms, universities are no longer obliged to provide data on carbon reduction and other green issues to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa).</p> <p>The Office for Students (OfS) has taken over the role of overseeing the higher education sector from Hefce, the funding council that originally set the targets. An OfS spokeswoman explains: \u201cWe are committed to being a low-burden regulator and will therefore only mandate data collection where it is necessary to support our regulatory functions. Currently, the OfS does not have a regulatory need for the data within the estates management record.\u201d</p> <p>She adds: \u201cWe fully support Hesa and providers working together to collect data on a voluntary basis where this adds value, but providers will have freedom to opt in to such collections.

      "bodyText": "While young people call for urgent action on the climate emergency, universities are lagging behind, with two-thirds likely to fail their 2020 targets for the reduction of carbon emissions. And academic conferences are partly to blame. Air travel is estimated to be responsible for more than 2% of global human-induced emissions, and lecturers\u2019 flights could be adding significantly to the carbon footprint of many universities, according to transport data provided voluntarily by 67 institutions. According to the 2019 People and Planet University League published on Tuesday, the sector appears to be taking the issues more seriously, increasingly embedding sustainability into its teaching. But still only 49 of 154 institutions are likely to meet the target set by the former funding agency of a 43% reduction of carbon emissions between 2005 and 2020. The table compiled by People and Planet, the student-led network, scores universities out of 100 on criteria such as environmental audits and management systems, the number of staff working on the issues, ethical investment, carbon management, waste and recycling, and sustainable food. The lack of progress is frustrating, says Hannah Smith, the network\u2019s co-director of campaigns and research. \u201cIt\u2019s abhorrent to watch universities fail on climate change at a time when people on the frontlines of the impacts are fighting back against heatwaves and forest fires. Universities have a duty to stand with those communities and their students on strike and use their privileged position to act,\u201d she says. Network member Steff Farley, 25, a maths postgraduate student at Loughborough University, adds: \u201cThe findings expose the dragging lack of willpower, vision and energy in the sector, which shows disregard for the young climate strikers at schools, colleges and at their own universities.\u201d The table shows that just eight universities have a policy to invest in renewable energy, says Emily Adams, 23, who is studying marine biology and oceanography at the University of Plymouth. \u201cOur universities must now step up to take action to fund a just climate transition,\u201d she adds. This year\u2019s findings on carbon reduction are all the more alarming because this could be the last we hear of them. Under the government\u2019s higher education reforms, universities are no longer obliged to provide data on carbon reduction and other green issues to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa). The Office for Students (OfS) has taken over the role of overseeing the higher education sector from Hefce, the funding council that originally set the targets. An OfS spokeswoman explains: \u201cWe are committed to being a low-burden regulator and will therefore only mandate data collection where it is necessary to support our regulatory functions. Currently, the OfS does not have a regulatory need for the data within the estates management record.\u201d She adds: \u201cWe fully support Hesa and providers working together to collect data on a voluntary basis where this adds value, but providers will have freedom to opt in to such collections. Where Hesa and providers engage in additional activities beyond those mandated by OfS, this will be subject to additional subscriptions.\u201d People and Planet say that voluntary data collection would be incomplete and that having to pay to access the information could put it beyond the organisation\u2019s reach. Smith says: \u201cIt is vexatious that while students of all ages go on strike to build a global movement for an equitable carbon transition, the OfS rows backwards to a time where measuring carbon emissions was deemed superfluous admin.\u201d Universities say that they have struggled to make serious carbon reductions against a background of increased student numbers and campus expansion. In addition, the trend towards collaboration between academics from different countries and the growth of the conference scene has led to more lecturers getting on planes. According to a study of air travel at the University of British Columbia in Canada in 2017, staff from just five departments made 709 air trips over 18 months.

      "body": "<p>Decisions, decisions, decisions. After pinpointing which subject and university to study at for at least three years, the next serious conundrum for prospective students is accommodation. </p> <p>Price undoubtedly is an issue, with 97% of first-year students citing value for money as an important factor, and 96% citing overall cost, <a href=\"https://content.knightfrank.com/research/1663/documents/en/knight-frank-ucas-student-housing-survey-201819-6002.pdf\" title=\"\">according to a survey by Ucas and Knight Frank</a>. That means compromises will likely need to be made. \u201cIf being on campus is a priority, you could look at reducing your room cost by sharing a bathroom,\u201d says Trudi Vout, director of campus and accommodation services at the University of Hull. \u201cOr if having your own en-suite is essential, investigate options off-campus \u2013 or go for slightly less modern options.\u201d</p> <p>The majority of students opt to stay in halls of residence, where there\u2019s often staff and mature students on hand \u2013 perhaps an extra advantage for any anxious parents. The sheer number of rooms on each floor creates instant access to a network of potential <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/11/seven-ways-to-make-new-friends\">friends</a>. \u201cLiving in halls meant I was able to settle into university more easily and spend some good quality time with my flatmates,\u201d says Ada Ughanwa, 19, a second-year sociology and criminology student at Loughborough University. \u201cSharing a kitchen made us bump into each other and have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/picture/2018/jul/07/berger-wyse-great-conversation-cartoon\">good conversations</a>.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/sep/25/nine-rules-for-your-first-days-in-halls\">Halls</a> are usually near or on campus too, saving crucial time commuting to lectures. For Ughanwa that meant an extra hour in bed before lectures and the ability to \u201cgo home and eat a snack or go over the notes I made in class\u201d. However, halls can be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/sep/23/i-was-kicked-out-of-halls-after-one-night-your-freshers-week-regrets\">noisy</a> \u2013 worth bearing in mind for students that crave the quiet life. Another key consideration is catered or self-catered; most university halls offer both.</p> <p>Students \u2013 and parents \u2013 prepared to spend a little more can opt for a place at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/may/09/moving-out-of-your-student-flat-beware-the-small-print\">privately rented</a> halls or flats. The upside with the latter is more choice of areas to live in, but they come with the hassle of managing bills and dealing with landlords.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the nuclear option: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/14/commuter-students-survive-studying-from-home-university\">staying at home</a>. \u201cLiving at home can appeal for economic and social reasons,\u201d says Paul Burns, accommodation office manager at the University of Manchester. \u201cSome students (or their families) fear they are not ready to make the transition to independent or semi-independent living.

      "bodyText": "Decisions, decisions, decisions. After pinpointing which subject and university to study at for at least three years, the next serious conundrum for prospective students is accommodation. Price undoubtedly is an issue, with 97% of first-year students citing value for money as an important factor, and 96% citing overall cost, according to a survey by Ucas and Knight Frank. That means compromises will likely need to be made. \u201cIf being on campus is a priority, you could look at reducing your room cost by sharing a bathroom,\u201d says Trudi Vout, director of campus and accommodation services at the University of Hull. \u201cOr if having your own en-suite is essential, investigate options off-campus \u2013 or go for slightly less modern options.\u201d The majority of students opt to stay in halls of residence, where there\u2019s often staff and mature students on hand \u2013 perhaps an extra advantage for any anxious parents. The sheer number of rooms on each floor creates instant access to a network of potential friends. \u201cLiving in halls meant I was able to settle into university more easily and spend some good quality time with my flatmates,\u201d says Ada Ughanwa, 19, a second-year sociology and criminology student at Loughborough University. \u201cSharing a kitchen made us bump into each other and have good conversations.\u201d Halls are usually near or on campus too, saving crucial time commuting to lectures. For Ughanwa that meant an extra hour in bed before lectures and the ability to \u201cgo home and eat a snack or go over the notes I made in class\u201d. However, halls can be noisy \u2013 worth bearing in mind for students that crave the quiet life. Another key consideration is catered or self-catered; most university halls offer both. Students \u2013 and parents \u2013 prepared to spend a little more can opt for a place at privately rented halls or flats. The upside with the latter is more choice of areas to live in, but they come with the hassle of managing bills and dealing with landlords. Then there\u2019s the nuclear option: staying at home. \u201cLiving at home can appeal for economic and social reasons,\u201d says Paul Burns, accommodation office manager at the University of Manchester. \u201cSome students (or their families) fear they are not ready to make the transition to independent or semi-independent living. But it has the danger of making university little more than an extension of sixth-form.\u201d However, living at home in Gateshead brought plenty of advantages for Abbie March, 22, a final-year business and marketing management student at Northumbria University. \u201cI planned on travelling to Asia in the summer holidays, so I needed to save as much money as possible,\u201d says March, who visited destinations like Thailand and Bali over the three years. \u201cJoining friends from my course was easy enough, as I was living 10 minutes away from the centre. You can still go out a lot and also have more money for holidays.\u201d For those staying at home, Vout recommends making the effort to play for a team or join a society. \u201cSome of the strongest friendships you make at university can come from a shared interest \u2013 whether that is sport, volunteering or creative writing. Our last student union president said it was at the netball club that she made her friends for life.\u201d Top tips for parents with students living at home Lay out some ground rules Yes, they might have been living with you for 18 years, but now they\u2019re at university and adults themselves there needs to be a discussion about what everyone\u2019s expectations are.

      "bodyText": "Steve Smith\u2019s parents were devastated to be told at school parents\u2019 evening that the best their working\u2011class son could hope for was a job sweeping floors in the local shoe factory. He is now vice-chancellor of the University of Exeter, part of the elite Russell Group. Nick Petford left school at 16 and worked in a tool-packing factory before training to install air-conditioning. He is now vice-chancellor of the University of Northampton. Britain\u2019s most powerful jobs continue to be stacked with a tiny elite of people who attended private schools. But new research suggests that meritocracy is alive and well at the top of our universities. Only 16% of university vice-chancellors went to independent schools, according to a study by the Sutton Trust and the Social Mobility Commission of the educational backgrounds of 5,000 leading figures across a range of jobs. In contrast, private school alumni make up 65% of judges, 59% of civil service permanent secretaries, 57% of the House of Lords and 44% of national newspaper columnists. The study demonstrates that higher education \u2013 alongside football \u2013 is one of the few British professions in which working-class people have been able to reach the top. Smith\u2019s theory is that this is because studying at university is much more of a \u201cleveller\u201d than any other process you go through; the point from which your outcome is no longer determined by your background. And, crucially, he says those who stay on to do research are judged on how good their intellectual work is \u2013 in his case, in international relations. \u201cMy first articles weren\u2019t rejected because I was Steve Smith, born in a house with an outside loo \u2013 they were blind to my origins,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd when I became president of the world academic body in my field, it wasn\u2019t because of my class, it was all about my academic record.\u201d Nonetheless, given that no one in his family had gone on to higher education before, Smith says he wouldn\u2019t have made it to the University of Southampton if someone hadn\u2019t spotted his potential. His dad came home in tears from that parents\u2019 evening at Norwich City comprehensive school in 1969, because his teacher thought boys like him shouldn\u2019t have ideas above their station. But a second teacher, Mr Shearing, later told Smith that if he stopped mucking around in class he could really go somewhere. \u201cChrist, that made all the difference,\u201d he says. \u201cSomeone, somewhere, has to put faith in you to go forward.\u201d Petford says his life would have taken a very different path if he hadn\u2019t made it to university. A member of Southampton\u2019s first punk band in his teens, he left his comprehensive school at 16 with a handful of CSEs. He got a factory job, because that was what all his mates were doing.

      "body": "<p>\u2018I am very grateful that this wonderful event should happen in my lifetime. I was precisely 11 years, 0 months, 1 day old,\u201d I wrote diligently in my moon scrapbook. I was obsessed with the moon landings, to put it mildly, collecting every newspaper clipping. I wrote \u201cMan on the moon\u201d on every surface. Scratching it on to my desk meant I got a clip round the ear.</p> <p>No one else in my family understood it. It was yet another sign of my unbelonging. No one in Ipswich got the huge significance of it all the way I did, and I was made to go on a stupid school camping trip instead of watching it on television. Surely it was another sign that I was indeed an alien.</p> <p>As I grew up \u2013 not much, let\u2019s face it \u2013 my fascination continued. Those lyrics from Tom Waits\u2019s Shore Leave get me every time: \u201cAnd I wondered how the same moon outside over this Chinatown fair / could look down on Illinois / and find you there.\u201d We all see that same moon and we are all made somehow both bigger and smaller by this knowledge.

      "bodyText": "\u2018I am very grateful that this wonderful event should happen in my lifetime. I was precisely 11 years, 0 months, 1 day old,\u201d I wrote diligently in my moon scrapbook. I was obsessed with the moon landings, to put it mildly, collecting every newspaper clipping. I wrote \u201cMan on the moon\u201d on every surface. Scratching it on to my desk meant I got a clip round the ear. No one else in my family understood it. It was yet another sign of my unbelonging. No one in Ipswich got the huge significance of it all the way I did, and I was made to go on a stupid school camping trip instead of watching it on television. Surely it was another sign that I was indeed an alien. As I grew up \u2013 not much, let\u2019s face it \u2013 my fascination continued. Those lyrics from Tom Waits\u2019s Shore Leave get me every time: \u201cAnd I wondered how the same moon outside over this Chinatown fair / could look down on Illinois / and find you there.\u201d We all see that same moon and we are all made somehow both bigger and smaller by this knowledge. The ancients knew. And I did too. We could touch the sky. Every snippet of information I could gather went into that scrapbook. The science of it? Well, I will leave that to those who know far more than me but, looking back, the risks Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins took strike me as enormous.

No-deal opponents could also try a number of other tactics leading to a no-confidence vote \u2013 without forcing a general election, but possibly with a new prime minister emerging.</p> \n<p>Rahman expects \u201cmanoeuvres to begin\u201d in September and the revolt \u2013 likely to be joined by several current cabinet and junior ministers \u2013 to peak as the UK gets closer to the 31 October cliff edge, most likely after the 17-18 October European summit. \u201cOne thing is clear: things are going to get very messy indeed,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CER_Grant/status/1150803671858462721\">Charles Grant of the Centre for European Reform says</a> the EU will not blink on renegotiation. It could, however, offer a new political declaration on the future relationship, confirm it does not want the backstop to be permanent, and offer a longer transition \u2013 though none of those are sure to make a difference in Westminster.</p> \n<p>A further lengthy article 50 extension may well only be offered if the UK held an election or referendum, Grant says. And when talks on the future relationship finally start, the EU27 will be every bit as tough on coordinating the process, ensuring EU unity and keeping member states and MEPs on board as it was during phase one.</p> \n<h2>Best of the rest</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/15/darren-grimes-accuses-elections-regulator-errors-spending-case-brexit\">Darren Grimes accuses elections regulator</a> of errors in spending case</p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/15/post-brexit-trade-pact-with-us-may-take-some-time-says-liam-fox\">Post-Brexit trade pact with US</a> may take some time, says Liam Fox</p></li> \n <li><p>Not cricket: Jacob Rees-Mogg <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/14/not-cricket-jacob-rees-mogg-criticised\">criticised for World Cup comments</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/15/flawed-home-office-app-stops-eu-citizen-getting-settled-status\">Flawed Home Office app</a> stops EU citizen getting settled status</p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/15/eu-migrants-43bn-contribution-to-uk-should-be-spent-on-poor\">EU migrants\u2019 \u00a34.3bn contribution</a> to UK \u2018should be spent on poor\u2019</p></li> \n <li><p>Brexit party MEP called for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/12/brexit-party-mep-criticised-over-belgrano-twitter-comments\">EU fishing vessels to be \u2018sunk like Belgrano\u2019</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/11/amber-rudd-drops-opposition-to-no-deal-brexit\">Amber Rudd embraces no-deal Brexit</a> as ministers pitch to Johnson</p></li> \n <li><p>UK economy returns to growth as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/10/uk-economy-returns-to-growth-as-carmakers-end-brexit-shutdown-ons\">carmakers end Brexit shutdown</a></p></li> \n <li><p>Northern Ireland civil service chief warns of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/10/northern-ireland-civil-service-chief-warns-of-brexit-threat-to-society\">Brexit threat to society</a></p></li> \n <li><p>No-deal Brexit a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/09/irish-ministers-meet-to-discuss-dire-outcomes-of-no-deal-brexit\">political and economic threat</a>, Ireland warns</p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/09/bmw-engine-production-uk-brexit-fears\">BMW moves some engine production</a> out of UK over Brexit fears</p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Top comment</h2> \n<p>In the Observer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/14/where-are-the-uk-politicians-with-principles-they-would-stand-down-for\">Andrew Rawnsley asks</a> where are the politicians with principles they would stand down for:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>A moral dilemma will face Tory MPs in the highly likely event of a Boris Johnson premiership. He has said he is prepared to crash Britain out of the EU on Halloween without a deal, a prospect that a significant cohort of Conservative MPs regard as grotesquely irresponsible. This autumn, these Tory MPs may have to choose between permitting a calamity Brexit or voting with the opposition to stop it, even if that means collapsing their own government. How far can their principles be stretched? In some cases, Tory consciences have a lot of elastic in their knickers. Matt Hancock and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/11/amber-rudd-drops-opposition-to-no-deal-brexit\" title=\"\">Amber Rudd</a>, who have previously been eloquently vocal about what a catastrophe a no-deal Brexit would be, are now sounding like people reconciled to the idea, a conversion that may not be entirely unconnected to the expectation that Mr Johnson will be picking the next cabinet. Others have been more consistent. Ken Clarke, the former chancellor, said he would rather vote on a confidence motion to terminate his own government than allow a crash-out Brexit. Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, says the same. If it comes to the crunch, they will put conscience and country first. Other Tories have yet to finish wrestling with their principles. When do they say to themselves that enough is enough?</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h2>Top tweet:</h2> \n<p>Ah, what blissful relief from Brexit was that weekend of sport:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/davidallengreen/status/1150474603250290688\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Glance at Twitter to see the great British public banging each other over the heads with cricket bats and tennis racquets in a spirited battle over which is the better sport, Brexit completely forgotten.<br><br>Oh wonderful day.</p>\u2014 David Allen Green (@davidallengreen) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidallengreen/status/1150474603250290688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 14, 2019</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure>",

Meanwhile, the woman chosen by EU leaders to replace Jean-Claude Juncker as president of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said \u2013 to nobody\u2019s surprise - that she would not be reopening Brexit talks. Yet in their final debate, both Johnson and Hunt significantly hardened their Brexit positions, declaring the Northern Ireland backstop \u201cdead\u201d and promising that even if it was tweaked it could not feature in any exit deal with the EU. Something will have to give ... What next According to the usually well-informed analyst Mujtaba Rahman of Eurasia Group, the incoming government will do \u201ceverything it can\u201d to deny no-deal opponents parliamentary space, denying opposition day debates and trying to avoid no-deal legislation to prevent it being amended. At least two bills will, however, have to be rushed through before 31 October, on trade and financial services. No-deal opponents could also try a number of other tactics leading to a no-confidence vote \u2013 without forcing a general election, but possibly with a new prime minister emerging. Rahman expects \u201cmanoeuvres to begin\u201d in September and the revolt \u2013 likely to be joined by several current cabinet and junior ministers \u2013 to peak as the UK gets closer to the 31 October cliff edge, most likely after the 17-18 October European summit. \u201cOne thing is clear: things are going to get very messy indeed,\u201d he says. Meanwhile Charles Grant of the Centre for European Reform says the EU will not blink on renegotiation. It could, however, offer a new political declaration on the future relationship, confirm it does not want the backstop to be permanent, and offer a longer transition \u2013 though none of those are sure to make a difference in Westminster. A further lengthy article 50 extension may well only be offered if the UK held an election or referendum, Grant says. And when talks on the future relationship finally start, the EU27 will be every bit as tough on coordinating the process, ensuring EU unity and keeping member states and MEPs on board as it was during phase one.

He has said he is prepared to crash Britain out of the EU on Halloween without a deal, a prospect that a significant cohort of Conservative MPs regard as grotesquely irresponsible. This autumn, these Tory MPs may have to choose between permitting a calamity Brexit or voting with the opposition to stop it, even if that means collapsing their own government. How far can their principles be stretched? In some cases, Tory consciences have a lot of elastic in their knickers. Matt Hancock and Amber Rudd, who have previously been eloquently vocal about what a catastrophe a no-deal Brexit would be, are now sounding like people reconciled to the idea, a conversion that may not be entirely unconnected to the expectation that Mr Johnson will be picking the next cabinet. Others have been more consistent. Ken Clarke, the former chancellor, said he would rather vote on a confidence motion to terminate his own government than allow a crash-out Brexit. Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, says the same. If it comes to the crunch, they will put conscience and country first. Other Tories have yet to finish wrestling with their principles. When do they say to themselves that enough is enough? Top tweet: Ah, what blissful relief from Brexit was that weekend of sport:",

The latest, Hotel Lyra Plitvice, which opened in May, is in an unlikely spot, only 2\u00bd miles from the border. When I reached Li\u010dko Petrovo Selo, I was prepared for the sight of ruined houses in this predominantly ethnic Serbian village, because I knew it had suffered in 1995, at the end of the Croatian war.

      "bodyText": "In the 15 years since I last visited Plitvice Lakes national park, much has changed in this mountainous region of Lika, near Croatia\u2019s border with Bosnia-Herzegovina. Hotels, apartments, B&amp;Bs and campsites have popped up at a rapid rate, their owners catering for visitors to these glorious, Unesco-listed lakes: 16 of them, tumbling down countless waterfalls in every shade of blue and green, from jade to turquoise and deep ocean blue. As only three hotels are allowed in the national park, this other accommodation has appeared across the region. The latest, Hotel Lyra Plitvice, which opened in May, is in an unlikely spot, only 2\u00bd miles from the border. When I reached Li\u010dko Petrovo Selo, I was prepared for the sight of ruined houses in this predominantly ethnic Serbian village, because I knew it had suffered in 1995, at the end of the Croatian war. From a population of 2,000 before the conflict, it has dropped to around 120. Instead, I found signs of regeneration, helped by the Lyra\u2019s opening. Built on the site of the derelict village school, the 58-room hotel has gone against the local grain of faux-rustic and has a sleek, modern style: the steeply sloped roof sits against a towering wall of pine trees and the decor is low-key and contemporary, with original artworks and a sophisticated glass-walled lounge bar. The Lyra uses some of its income to help rebuild the village, one property at a time. It\u2019s early days, though it has already started restoring a small community centre used by the Tara Citizens\u2019 Association, a collective of mostly older women created in 2004 by villager Sonja Leka, who spent seven years as a refugee in Belgrade. Their small-scale production of handicrafts is giving them a much-needed financial and psychological boost, and the plan is to sell them in the hotel. About 90% of the food served in the hotel comes from local producers, including delectable grilled trout in the evening and fat kobasica sausages at breakfast. And in a spirit of reconciliation \u2013 in the region where some of the first shots were fired in the conflict \u2013 the Slovenian tour agency that owns the hotel, Happy Tours, is hiring equal numbers of Croats, Serbs and Bosnians.

A committee of the House of Lords criticised the government in a report for failing to put the ban into proper effect. If the discard ban \u2013 which was the subject of a media campaign and petition to the House of Commons \u2013 had been properly put into effect, then fishermen would have been expected to land numerous small fish which were ineligible to be landed under the EU\u2019s fishing laws. However, very few such fish were landed, leading the Lords to conclude in two reports that the ban had been widely flouted. The wasteful practice of discarding edible fish at sea has been one of the key charges levelled against the EU\u2019s common fisheries policy, which requires fishing vessels to throw back fish if they have already exceeded their quota for certain species. The practice of discarding, which has resulted in an estimated 1m tonnes of fish a year being thrown back into the water, dead or in too poor a condition to carry on living, has been targeted for reform since 2011, when the EU said it would phase it out over several years in order to conserve fish populations.

Sue Pritchard, director of the RSA commission and an organic farmer in Wales, said the UK had the third cheapest basket of food in the developed world, but also had the highest food poverty in Europe in terms of people being able to afford a healthy diet. * * * Asian floods \u2013 More than four million people have been forced to flee their homes across south Asia after severe flooding hit the region. At least 100 people have died in India, Nepal and Bangladesh as the first burst of the annual monsoon rains wreaked havoc. The impoverished Indian states of Assam and Bihar have been among the worst hit. Most of the millions displaced from their homes are in Assam, a tea-producing state in India\u2019s north-east often hit hard by monsoon flooding. * * * \u2018Not good enough\u2019 \u2013 London\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, has thrown out plans by developers to build a 300-metre-high skyscraper near the Tower of London. The project known as \u201cthe Tulip\u201d for its bulging top was deemed of insufficient quality by the mayor and there was also concern that it would damage views of the capital\u2019s skyline. The building, designed by Norman Foster\u2019s architectural practice, would have been the second tallest in western Europe. The project\u2019s backers had said it would attract 1.2 million visitors a year. * * * Making the gradient \u2013 A town in north Wales is planning a celebration after one of its streets was named the steepest in the world by the Guinness Book of Records. Ffordd Pen Llech, a meandering road in the historic town of Harlech, has been judged steeper than its title rival, Baldwin Street in Dunedin, New Zealand. It has been established that Ffordd Pen Llech has a gradient of 37.5% at its steepest point, compared with Baldwin\u2019s mere 35%. Today in Focus podcast: politician or journalist? Boris Johnson has long attempted to hold down careers in both politics and journalism. As he hopes to take over as prime minister, his biographers Sonia Purnell and Andrew Gimson look at what his career in newspapers says about his character and abilities for the top job in UK politics. Lunchtime read: The decline and fall of French cuisine If, like me, you go to a restaurant in France and wonder what the fuss is all about, then today\u2019s long read is for you. Ranging from the 18th century origin of restaurants to nouvelle cuisine, Wendell Steavenson takes us on a culinary history tour and asks how French cooking went from being regarded as the best in the world to being ruled by what she calls a \u201ctyranny of meat-in-brown-sauce\u201d. But help is at hand. In \u201cthe new global foodie zeitgeist\u201d a younger generation of chefs are now establishing themselves in French kitchens so it might be possible to visit France and eat something other than bland, overcooked meat. Sport Ben Stokes\u2019s remarkable performances during the Cricket World Cup, capped by a bravura display in the final, suggest Stokes 3.0 could be the best iteration of all, writes Barney Ronay. Eoin Morgan has been backed to remain as the England one-day captain for the foreseeable future while in his latest Guardian column, Moeen Ali writes: \u201cIn the England dressing room it does not matter where you come from or what you believe in if you show courage, unity and respect.\u201d England\u2019s netballers have made it part of their mantra to have fun at this World Cup and their 56-48 defeat of Jamaica means they can \u2013 for a few days at least. Everton have completed the signing of Fabian Delph from Manchester City with Marco Silva convinced the 29-year-old can play an influential role on and off the pitch at Goodison Park. Novak Djokovic\u2019s Wimbledon triumph means he has 16 majors, four behind Roger Federer. Overhauling the Swiss is not a subject the Serb is shying away from after saying he can thrive for years to come. Business Young people working in London are spending more than half of their income on rent, according to a study. The pay gap was making it harder for public services such as nursing and policing to attract workers. Asian markets were up overnight but the FTSE100 is set to open slightly down. The pound is buying $1.252 and \u20ac1.112. The papers Several papers lead with the condemnation of Donald Trump\u2019s outburst at his critics. The i leads with \u201cTory rivals condemn \u2018offensive\u2019 Trump jibe\u201d, and the Times says \u201cTory rivals take aim at Trump\u201d. The Guardian leads with revelations about Boris Johnson\u2019s comments on Islam: \u201cIslam kept Muslim world centuries behind the west, Johnson claimed\u201d while the Sun says \u201cHunt backs Boris\u201d. There\u2019s more divergence elsewhere. The FT goes for \u201cSantander offered Orcel \u20ac52m deal to sign on as bank chief\u201d, the Mail has \u201cToxic threat to babies in womb\u201d, the Metro says simply \u201ce-scooters crackdown\u201d, and the Telegraph splashes with \u201c\u2018Middle-aged white chiefs\u2019 are problem for modern military\u201d. Most editions have a picture of England\u2019s cricketers with the World Cup trophy but the Mirror leads with an exclusive from Ben Stokes: \u201cThis is what it feels like to be on top of the world.\u201d Sign up The Guardian morning briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.

You\u2019ll remember that, back in 2015, Peter Dutton failed to see a live mic when yukking it up with Morrison and Tony Abbott about the likely fate of Pacific Island nations. \u201cTime doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d Dutton joked, \u201cwhen you\u2019re about to have water lapping at your door.\u201d Meanwhile, arid countries also face an existential threat, from desertification and permanent drought. By 2050, the World Bank expects the displacement of perhaps 143 million people from sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Latin America.

Climate refugees, in other words, don\u2019t exist \u2013 at least, not from the perspective of the current legal apparatus. They might have done nothing wrong (few people have smaller carbon footprints than the inhabitants of sub-Saharan Africa). They might be the victims of processes set in train by others.

      "bodyText": "Last year, judges at the 28th International Berkeley Springs Water Tasting competition deemed the best bottled water in the world to be an Australian brand \u201cinfused with the sound frequencies of love, the moon, and light spectrums of the rainbow\u201d. Called Frequency H2O and sold for A$3.30 a liter (US$2.30), the water is, according to its creator Sturt Hinton, an \u201cultimate elixir of life\u201d. Also recognized by the judges was Svalbar\u00f0i, a company that sells $90 bottles of water freshly squeezed from \u2013 wait for it \u2013 melting Norwegian icebergs. The extravagant taglines and price tag make luxury bottled water a sort of liquid climate change for the rich. Despite an abundance of logical reasons to avoid it, the bottled water industry has never been stronger. And \u201cpremium\u201d bottled water, the extra-fancy sort touted for \u201chealth benefits\u201d like alkalinity, is the fastest-growing sector of the US bottled water industry, itself valued at $18.5bn. Whether such elite products are pumped from 3,000 feet beneath Hawaii or extracted from Fijian springs and sprinkled with gold dust, most justify their inherent excess with a similar refrain: the more obscure the origin, or elaborate the preparation, the healthier, higher quality, and more delicious the water. This, of course, is happening in a context where water scarcity is an accelerating global crisis, predicted to affect two-thirds of the world\u2019s population by 2025. And plastic pollution, to which discarded water bottles contribute immensely, has become an issue so dire experts anticipate that by 2050 the ocean will be filled with more plastic than fish. Also to consider: nothing about bottled water makes it inherently superior to tap. The majority of American tap water is safe, as is essentially all UK tap water, and more closely regulated for contaminants than bottled. In blind taste tests, subjects cannot distinguish between bottled and tap water. And tap water, of course, is nearly free. So why do we buy it?

A community of 40,000 north of Toronto, it is a typical small North American town, with widely spaced houses on large lots that makes efficient public transit a logistical challenge.</p> <p>The town desperately needed transit, said Paul Pentikainen, Innisfil\u2019s senior planner. But the option on the table \u2013 three bus routes \u2013 would cost the council nearly $1m. So they tried to think creatively.</p> <p>\u201c[We wanted to] connect all the drivers in the town with those that need these rides: that could be the basis for our transit system,\u201d said Pentikainen. \u201cAnd because Uber was already doing that, it just seemed to make sense for us.\u201d</p> <p>The contract also meant more work for Uber drivers, whose number in Innisfil increased to 2,203 in 2018. \u201cI just needed a sustainable income after I retired,\u201d said Dennis West, who started driving for Uber in December 2017. \u201cThis is a nice gig. You can do it when you want to do it \u2013 and you can do it as much as you want to do it. It works well.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d1f711325d84dbbb53598cec549ef859a6108559\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1f711325d84dbbb53598cec549ef859a6108559/0_398_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Pentikainen, Innisfil\u2019s senior policy planner.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Pentikainen, Innisfil\u2019s senior policy planner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cole Burston/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But success has come at an ironic cost to the town. Because Innisfil subsidises each ride, the more successful it is, the more the town pays to Uber. That figure is now projected to reach $1.2m for 2019 \u2013 more than the bus programme would have cost, and well above the $900,000 the city allocated. With ridership increasing each year, costs will only rise.</p> <p>\u201cIf you operate a regular bus system, you have a much better idea of what those costs will look like five or 10 years from now,\u201d said Christof Spieler, an urban planner and author of<em> </em>Trains, Buses, People. \u201cBut if you have a system with too many people using it, and you can\u2019t afford to provide [the service], how will you handle that?\u201d</p> <p>In fact, the town has taken the extraordinary step of deterring people from using Uber too much, capping the number of rides a resident can take per month.

      "bodyText": "When Daniel Arrega, 19, heads to work at a mall in Innisfil, he has few options for his commute. Walking along the highway would take nearly three hours. A taxi is faster but expensive. So he takes the town\u2019s public transit: Uber. \u201cIt\u2019s great for young people, especially if you don\u2019t have a licence,\u201d he said after arriving at the branch of Tommy Hilfiger where he works. In 2017, the town in Ontario, Canada, embarked on an ambitious \u2013 and, to its critics, fraught \u2013 experiment. It handed responsibility for public transit to the ride-sharing app Uber. Instead of buses or trains plying regular routes, it is Uber\u2019s roving cars that function as the transit fleet. When a rider opens the app, Innisfil Transit pops up as the cheapest option to travel between a network of popular areas called \u201chubs\u201d, such as libraries, the recreation centre or municipal buildings. The costs per ride vary, but on average passengers pay an average of CAD$5 (\u00a33), with the city subsiding the rest. Trips outside subsidised areas receive a flat $6 discount. Two years later, the Innisfil authorities argue that the project has been a success. Ridership is high \u2013 in 2018 there were 85,943 trips \u2013 and many residents have embraced the service. \u201cWe just absolutely love Uber. I take it, my son takes it, my dad takes it. I take it,\u201d said Shannon Kelly-Robb, who works at one of the libraries. But beyond the excitement of essentially having subsidised taxi service, experts paint a more troubling picture of questionable economic and environmental sustainability. The city has now spent more on Uber than the traditional transit option it was considering, and has dramatically increased the number of cars on its roads, with worrying implications for air quality and the climate crisis. What\u2019s more, Innisfil Transit has now attracted attention as the latest step in a growing assault on public transit systems by ride-sharing companies. Urban planners fear Uber isn\u2019t just taking riders away from public transit but that it is hoping to replace public transit altogether. In London and Denver, Uber has integrated public transit options into its app to become a \u201cone-stop shop for transportation\u201d. In regulatory filings, published in advance of its May IPO, Uber said it wants to \u201creplace personal vehicle ownership and usage and public transportation one use case at a time\u201d. Innisfil\u2019s deal with Uber is nothing \u201cother than a more expedited and abundant taxi system. That\u2019s all it is,\u201d said Jarrett Walker, a transit consultant based in Portland, Oregon, and author of Human Transit. \u201cThe notion that Uber has anything useful to offer public transit is just preposterous.\u201d Innisfil saw it differently. A community of 40,000 north of Toronto, it is a typical small North American town, with widely spaced houses on large lots that makes efficient public transit a logistical challenge. The town desperately needed transit, said Paul Pentikainen, Innisfil\u2019s senior planner. But the option on the table \u2013 three bus routes \u2013 would cost the council nearly $1m. So they tried to think creatively. \u201c[We wanted to] connect all the drivers in the town with those that need these rides: that could be the basis for our transit system,\u201d said Pentikainen. \u201cAnd because Uber was already doing that, it just seemed to make sense for us.\u201d The contract also meant more work for Uber drivers, whose number in Innisfil increased to 2,203 in 2018. \u201cI just needed a sustainable income after I retired,\u201d said Dennis West, who started driving for Uber in December 2017. \u201cThis is a nice gig. You can do it when you want to do it \u2013 and you can do it as much as you want to do it. It works well.\u201d But success has come at an ironic cost to the town. Because Innisfil subsidises each ride, the more successful it is, the more the town pays to Uber. That figure is now projected to reach $1.2m for 2019 \u2013 more than the bus programme would have cost, and well above the $900,000 the city allocated. With ridership increasing each year, costs will only rise. \u201cIf you operate a regular bus system, you have a much better idea of what those costs will look like five or 10 years from now,\u201d said Christof Spieler, an urban planner and author of Trains, Buses, People. \u201cBut if you have a system with too many people using it, and you can\u2019t afford to provide [the service], how will you handle that?\u201d In fact, the town has taken the extraordinary step of deterring people from using Uber too much, capping the number of rides a resident can take per month. For mall worker Arrega, who has been \u201cworking like crazy\u201d, that often means exceeding the limit midway through the month, although the town allows riders to apply for an exemption. It has also increased the cost of a ride by $1. In a late May briefing note, however, Innsifil authorities said few cost savings had been made: additional revenues from the fare increase have been offset by increased ridership costs, as more residents successfully petition for exemptions. \u201cFor a transit agency, [a service like Uber] works best when not very many people are using it,\u201d said Walker. \u201cBecause when people start using it in any numbers, it devours the the entire budget.\u201d Still, he understands why Innisfil made the decision, saying it might be the right thing to do for a sprawling town with low population density where bus stops would be far from destinations. Nevertheless, Uber\u2019s messaging is working: planners from other cities have contacted Innisfil for advice on how to create a similar system, said Pentikainen. But Spieler warns that what might work for more rural areas would be a disaster in denser cities. \u201cIf you are a city government and if you\u2019re finding that the [best option] for providing any kind of transit is subsidising Lyft and Uber, you have made some really bad decisions in planning your city,\u201d he said. Troubling oversights have already emerged in the two years since the programme began: there are no ways for low-income residents to offset the costs of transit \u2013 despite staff identifying an average of 40 trips each month to the town\u2019s food bank. Pentikainen says further subsidy for low income residents is \u201csomething we\u2019re thinking of\u201d, including using gift cards for residents. Pentikainen also brushed off concerns with Uber\u2019s controversial labour practices, which have received intense scrutiny in many cities, saying drivers \u201cabsolutely love the job\u201d and the town has received no complaints over compensation. Since the introduction of ride-sharing companies such as Uber, transit use has fallen in major American cities nearly 2%, and those losses are cumulative: since Uber first started in San Francisco in 2010, bus ridership has dropped by more than 12%. As well as harming transit revenues, ride-sharing is the likely culprit behind a surge in traffic congestion and increased emissions. A recent study in the journal Science Advances found that Uber and Lyft are the biggest contributors to San Francisco\u2019s crippling traffic congestion. Between 2010 and 2016, congestion surged 62% \u2013 a dramatic increase over what modelling projected without the companies, and a strong rebuttal to corporates claims ride-sharing in fact reduces traffic congestion. As for the environmental impact, there is even less doubt about the negative impact.

      "body": "<p>In 2006, after years reporting in the Middle East, I moved to Paris. It was an accidental choice, the serendipity of a sublet through a friend of a friend. It was meant to be temporary; at the time I was just looking for somewhere to hole up and finish a book. My friends all said: \u201cOh Paris, how lovely! You must be eating well.\u201d They were surprised to hear me complain that Parisian menus were dull and repetitive. \u201cPat\u00e9 followed by nothing but entrec\u00f4te, entrec\u00f4te, entrec\u00f4te. Occasionally roast lamb, duck breast. No vegetables to speak of,\u201d I told them. \u201cIt\u2019s a tyranny of meat-in-brown-sauce.\u201d As the rest of the world had begun to (re)discover their own cuisines and innovate, the French restaurant seemed to be stagnating in a pool of congealing demi-glace.</p> <p>Elsewhere, places such as Balthazar in New York and the Wolseley in London seemed to be doing the French restaurant better than the French. In France, the old guard of critics and restaurateurs remained convinced that French cuisine was still the best in the world and a point of national pride. The bistros cleaved to the traditional red-and-white checked table cloths and chalked-up menus even as they were microwaving pre-prepared boeuf bourguignon in the back. In 2010, when the French restaurant meal was added to <a href=\"https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/gastronomic-meal-of-the-french-00437\" title=\"\">Unesco\u2019s list</a> of the world\u2019s \u201cintangible cultural heritage\u201d, it felt as if the French restaurant had become a museum piece, and a parody of itself.</p> <p>The perceived excellence of their cuisine and restaurants has long represented a vital part of French national identity. It was too easy to ascribe this decline to a certain national conservatism, complacency and parochialism \u2013 facile Anglo-Saxon taunts. The real story is more complicated. The restaurant business always has been subject to changes in society and economic circumstances. Food \u2013 what we eat and how we go out to eat it \u2013 is constantly evolving, according to trend and time.</p> <p>I left France for four years between 2010 and 2014. When I returned to Paris, things had changed. Australians had established Italian coffee bars and you could finally get a decent cappuccino. New cocktail bars had appeared and trendy cafes were making mojitos with real lime juice. <em>Le Hamburger</em> was all the rage. Parisians had embraced Asian food in a big way \u2013 ramen counters proliferated, a cover article last year for Le Monde Magazine\u2019s gastronomy special was entitled <em>L\u2019Asie Majeure</em>, which can be roughly translated as \u201cthe Asian wave\u201d. Even the white-haired doge of French chefs, the great Alain Ducasse, admitted that his ideal lunch was cold soba noodles. New flavours and a new informality to dining were taking hold, but at the same time, more than 200 years of restaurant culture is a formidable and loved institution. The question is how to manage tradition: what to keep and what to update?</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>For my parents\u2019 generation, and for 100 years before them, it was axiomatic that French food was the best in the world. In 1948, aged 13, my father was taken by his uncle to lunch at La Pyramide, a restaurant in the south-eastern town of Vienne. It was an experience that changed his life. Dad had grown up at boarding school in the Highlands during wartime privation and rationing: powdered egg, burnt toast, chilblains. The effect of his encounter with the cuisine of Fernand Point, France\u2019s most celebrated chef at the time, was profound. He had no idea that food could taste like that. Bresse chicken scented with tarragon and creamy potatoes dauphinoise seemed to melt on his tongue. He was impressed by the theatre of the service, the chocolate abundance of dessert trolley and the sommelier\u2019s embossed silver tastevin worn around his neck as proudly the gorget of a Napoleonic marshal (Dad was always a great fan of Napoleon).</p> <p>My father\u2019s life, and happily for me, the lives of his children, too, were shaped by that meal. We grew up cross-channel ferrying to Michelin-starred destinations, eating frogs\u2019 legs with our fingers, tasting wine we were too young to drink, learning the etiquettes of napkins-in-laps and fish forks. By the time he was six, my little brother liked to order six snails to start and then a dozen for the main course.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for the World of Mouth newsletter and get the best of Guardian food emailed direct to you\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/word-of-mouth\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Word of Mouth\" data-form-description=\"Our weekly email bringing you our best food writing\" data-form-campaign-code=\"UK_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"A weekly email bringing you our best food writing\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up for the World of Mouth newsletter and get the best of Guardian food emailed direct to you <br></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Such culinary epiphanies as my father\u2019s were not uncommon in the 20th century. The biographies of great chefs and Francophile memoirs \u2013 Hemingway, AJ Liebling, Julia Child \u2013 are full of them. A dozen oysters and a bottle of Chablis seemed to banish the successive miseries of the first world war, the Great Depression and the second world war. A generous plate of <em>cassoulet</em> or <em>blanquet</em><em>te de veau</em> was counterfoil to the industrialised conveniences of late 20th-century consumerism: supermarkets, packets of crisps, cans of soup. In Britain and America, it seemed as if we had lost our links to the land and its bounty. France was different.</p> <p>Back then, the best restaurants were French, and recipes were prepared according to the instructions of the great 19th-century French chefs Auguste Escoffier and Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame, and described even on English menus in italicised French: <em>\u00e0 la</em> \u2013 <em>chasseur</em>, <em>bordelaise</em>, <em>armoricaine</em>. French was the epitome of what food \u2013 a chicken or a piece of beef chuck or a carrot \u2013 could aspire to be. \u201cOh, in France you can\u2019t eat a bad meal!\u201d I remember my mother saying in my childhood. It was a common remark in the era. \u201cEven in the <em>routiers</em> [truck stops],\u201d my mother declared, \u201cthe <em>frites</em> are fresh and the <em>saucisson</em> delicious.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e843d1bde4d2cbc41871f51000723fd894d572df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e843d1bde4d2cbc41871f51000723fd894d572df/0_113_5315_3189/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Renowned French chef and mashed-potato obsessive Jo\u00ebl Robuchon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Renowned French chef and mashed-potato obsessive Jo\u00ebl Robuchon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerard Fouet/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fernand Point famously held that in order to master a dish you must cook it 100 times. He was as fastidious as he was fat. \u201cLook at the chef,\u201d he advised. \u201cIf he is thin, you will probably dine poorly.\u201d His cuisine married the two strands of French restaurant cuisine: tradition and <em>terroir</em>; Paris and the provinces. On the paternal side, the 19th-century tradition of feeding rich people richly: Car\u00eame\u2019s <em>pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance </em>confections, spun-sugar towers, <em>souffl\u00e9es</em> and <em>vol-au-vents</em> and Escoffier\u2019s artful flatteries marketed for a new age of celebrity; Tournedos Rossini, named after the famous composer; Peach Melba, after Nellie Melba the celebrated opera singer; strawberries \u00e0 la Sarah Bernhardt (with pineapple and Cura\u00e7ao sorbet). From the female side, Point took inspiration from generations of mothers, the <em>cuisine familiale</em> of peasants who lived and cooked close to the land, slowly braising one-pot dishes in the hearth: <em>daube de boeuf</em>, <em>cassoulet</em>, <em>pot-au-feu</em>, <em>coq au vin</em>.</p> <p>In many ways, Point\u2019s food represents the apex of classical French cuisine. Earthy yet refined, it relied on impeccable ingredients. The recipes in his cookbook, <em>Ma Gastronomie</em>, are almost absurdly simple. Very little is added to the main ingredient; a knob of butter, a ladle of stock, a handful of morels or a few tarragon leaves. Perhaps Point\u2019s most enduring legacy is the idea that great cooking is about elevating the essential taste of each individual ingredient. But it is also a sticking point.</p> <p>I remember having an argument with my French boyfriend because I suggested marinating the chicken for dinner in yoghurt and cumin. Boyfriend threw up his arms in alarm. \u201cBut isn\u2019t the point to taste the chicken?\u201d Furious and foreign, I replied: \u201cNo! It\u2019s just the opposite! Cooking is about messing with the chicken! Cooking is about adding flavour!\u201d Here was the rub between French culinary conservatism and the way we in Britain and America have magpied ingredients from all over the world and made national favourites out of hybrid curries and Tex-Mex.</p> <p>For more than 200 years, France was the centre of culinary endeavour \u2013 the place where chefs aspired to train and where restaurateurs looked for inspiration \u2013 but this was changing. At the turn of the millennium, when Ferran and Albert Adri\u00e0 at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/jun/19/el-bulli-ferran-adria\" title=\"\">El Bulli</a> in Spain were inventing molecular gastronomy by spherifying melon juice, France\u2019s great chef du jour, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/06/joel-robuchon-chef-of-the-century-dies-aged-73\" title=\"\">Jo\u00ebl Robuchon</a>, was perfecting mashed potatoes. There is no doubt that Robuchon\u2019s <em>pur\u00e9e</em> is probably the most extraordinary mouthful of potato you will swallow, but my own La Pyramide moment came at El Bulli in 2004 when I ate through the Adri\u00e0 brothers\u2019 imagination. I still remember every dish: an egg yolk encased in a transparent ravioli; a perfect rectangle of silver sardine with a black dot of fish guts reduced to essential umami. It changed not only the way I thought about food, but the way I thought about life. (Why follow rules? What are boundaries? What delicious joy to think beyond such constraints!) In 1997 Adam Gopnik wrote a watershed article in the New Yorker, echoing what people had been whispering for a while: <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1997/04/28/is-there-a-crisis-in-french-cooking\" title=\"\">\u201cIs there a crisis in French cooking?\u201d</a> Indeed, when I first arrived in Paris nine years later, there seemed to be. What had happened?</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The restaurant is a modern invention and, crucially, a French one. Of course, there have always been inns and taverns where travellers could get a bite. But the atmosphere tended to be male, the fare rough and ready, the tables shared. The word \u201crestaurant\u201d originally referred to a restorative, a pick-me-up, a fortifier. In the 18th century, as Paris grew, butchers began to sell <em>bouillons</em>, nourishing broths made from offcuts of meat, to workers and tradesmen. These early soup stalls became known as restaurants; a 1786 decree allowed \u201ccaterers and restaurateurs [those who make fortifying soups]\u201d to serve the public on site. You could now sit down at a table to partake of your soup instead of having to take it away.</p> <p>This decree coincided with the construction of the Palais Royale, with its elegant arcades designed to house shops and ateliers (and, inevitably, brothels, in one of which, some have said, a young Lt Bonaparte lost his virginity) in the style of an Eastern bazaar. This new shopping mall necessitated a food court for peckish Parisians, and many of the early restaurants were located in and around it. Le Grand Vefour still occupies the same corner where there has been a restaurant since 1784. It is possibly the most beautiful restaurant in the world. Its walls are painted with nymphs and garlands in the style of Louis XVI remembering a Roman villa, and tables bear small plaques naming former patrons: Napoleon, Victor Hugo, Jean Cocteau, Jean-Paul Sartre.</p> <p>The French revolution swept the old order away. The guilds had carved up food into jealously guarded specialities \u2013 only <em>charcutiers</em> could cure sausage, only <em>boulangers</em> baked bread; a <em>r\u00f4tissiseur</em> could roast meats but was not permitted to bake a stew in an oven \u2013 but now they were broken up. Paris roiled with politics and plots, hungry pamphleteers and provincials; restaurants sprang up everywhere to feed them. And the food changed, too. The elaborate banquets of the <em>ancien regime,</em> in which whole animals were stuffed and dressed and placed all at the same time on the table, were replaced by dishes that were served by waiters from a platter \u2013 in the Russian style. The new restaurants embodied the changed times: a menu of choice, individual portions served to anyone who could pay. Democracy on a plate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"33cffece4d3f645818657caac1dc28bf276d6461\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33cffece4d3f645818657caac1dc28bf276d6461/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The historic restaurant Le Grand Vefour in Paris France.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Possibly the most beautiful restaurant in the world \u2026 Le Grand Vefour in Paris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Almost as soon as they had invented the restaurant, the French invented the restaurant scene. The first restaurant critic, Grimod de la Reyni\u00e8re, wrote reviews in his gazette, the Gourmet\u2019s Almanac. By the time Napoleon had been defeated for the first time, in 1814, the almanac listed more than 300 restaurants in Paris. The lexicon of cuisine soon followed. Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame was the first celebrity chef, who cooked for kings and emperors, and wrote the code of French cooking, categorising the five great mother sauces (<em>b\u00e9chamel, espagnole, velout\u00e9, hollandaise</em> and tomato) from which all others were derived. Later, Escoffier organised the restaurant kitchen into the strict hierarchy that still prevails today, from the <em>commis chefs </em>at the bottom, to the <em>chefs de parties</em> who oversee the different stations of meat or fish or cold starter, to the <em>sous chef</em> and the<em> chef de cuisine</em>. Meanwhile, Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, a lawyer who coined the term <em>gastronome</em>, had made the intellectual leap: enjoying food was not just a pleasurable distraction, he argued, but a civilising art of existential import. As he once wrote: \u201cTell me what you eat and I\u2019ll tell you what you are.\u201d</p> <p>All the grammar and idiom of what we know and understand as \u201ca restaurant\u201d was developed by the French in the 19th century. The <em>menu</em>, the progression of <em>canap\u00e9s</em> and <em>hors d\u2019oeuvres</em> followed by <em>entr\u00e9e</em>, <em>plat</em> and <em>dessert</em>, the accompanying march of <em>aperitif</em>, wine, coffee, <em>digestif</em>. The way a <em>Ma\u00eetre D</em> (<em>Ma\u00eetre d\u2019h\u00f4tel</em>, or master of the house) welcomes guests, the formality of the waiters wearing traditional black tie. There was a specific pomp and performance to a restaurant, that was different to a diner or a pub or a taverna. In time, it would come to connote a sophistication that became seen as the special preserve of the French \u2013 and, for us rude mechanical Anglo-Saxons, the height of our aspirations.</p> <p>Through the 19th century, the restaurant flourished and evolved. The bistro was a cheerful neighbourhood place, often run by a husband and wife. Brasseries were brewery eateries brought to Paris by Alsatian refugees from the Franco-Prussian war of 1870, serving <em>choucroute</em> and draught beer. <em>Bouillons</em> were popular, working-class cafeterias that served cheap food in vast dining rooms that could seat hundreds at a time.</p> <p>There were dozens of bouillons in Paris between 1850-1950. Several were chains \u2013 the first restaurant groups, perhaps even the first fast-food joints \u2014 reaping economies of scale by sourcing in bulk and flipping tables as fast as a revolving door. By the time I got to Paris there was only one left, Chartier, in a forgotten corner of the ninth arrondissement. I used to go there often for the everyday classics: <em>oeuf dur mayonnaise</em>, <em>carottes rap\u00e9es</em>, <em>poulet-frites</em>,<em> t\u00eate de veau</em>. It had nicotine-coloured walls and the chattery humidity of a winter lunchtime crowd, and I liked to imagine it was the kind of place where Orwell had washed dishes when he was down and out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ec114aa85abfe5fae2a79b63071784f6023ece47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec114aa85abfe5fae2a79b63071784f6023ece47/0_258_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Bouillon Chartier restaurant in Paris.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Bouillon Chartier restaurant in Paris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During the Belle \u00c9poque, between the Franco-Prussian War and the next German invasion of France in 1914, Paris was the capital of the world. It embodied the breakneck speed and excitement of the times: cinema, Pasteur, the Eiffel Tower, aeroplanes, telephones, motor cars, impressionism, expressionism, cubism, Proust, Rimbaud, Diaghilev, art nouveau, haute couture<em> </em>and towering hats. Paris in the Belle \u00c9poque was zenith of style and taste; can there have ever been a better place and time in history to have enjoyed yourself? The French, as we all do, lament its passing. More than 100 years later, sometimes, as I would glance at a menu rich with foie gras, cream and beef, I would think they were consoling themselves by continuing to eat it.</p> <p>But by the time Lost Generation were carousing in its past glories in the 1920s, Paris was already living as a romanticised version of itself. AJ Liebling, later to become a war reporter covering D-Day and a famous New Yorker essayist, fell in love with French restaurants in his early 20s, even as plenty of older gourmets were lamenting that their heyday was over.</p> <p>For a long time after the second world war, no one noticed the decline of the French restaurant, partly because there was little competition. The British were boiling their vegetables to grey, and battering and frying everything else; the Americans were gelatinising salads and defrosting dinner. Chinese and Indian restaurants were still widely seen as cheap options (and still emulated the French with tablecloths and origami napkins), sushi was raw fish, and hardly anyone had been on holiday to Thailand or Morocco yet.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In the 70s my parents \u2013 like other foodies at the time \u2013 planned whole trips around the puffed asterisk recommendations of the Michelin Guide. <em>Le Guide Michelin</em> was first published in 1900 to encourage the early motorists to visit restaurants in the provinces, and soon became the grand arbiter of French cuisine. Obscure, definitive, conjuring an image of a lonely, corpulent inspector able to swallow whole goose livers in one gulp, Michelin had the power of a king to award stars and turn around the fortunes of a restaurant.</p> <p>But it also became a leviathan that focused on one kind of restaurant \u2013 those with formal dining rooms, white tablecloths and serried ranks of waiters. By the 90s, people had begun to complain that Michelin was hidebound and tended to favour its favourites. Fernand Point died in 1955, but Michelin continued to award La Pyramide three stars out of respect to his widow, who continued to run the restaurant, for more than 30 years until her death in 1986.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1d0a5babfb83acacaa0eb45e7b69b0e7ea31da37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d0a5babfb83acacaa0eb45e7b69b0e7ea31da37/0_174_1581_1507/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The first edition of Le Guide Michelin, from 1900.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"953\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The first edition of Le Guide Michelin, from 1900.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Cabanis/AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By then, restaurant economics had become brutal. Even grand chefs were buckling under the expense of laundering their damask tablecloths to snowy Michelin standards. As Thatcher and Reagan were liberalising their economies, French president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand promised \u201ca break with capitalism\u201d. He raised the minimum wage, allotted French workers a fifth week of paid vacation, lowered the retirement age to 60, and cut the work week to 39 hours (it was later to reduced again to 35).</p> <p>The bill was piled on to sky-high VAT \u2013 19.5% for restaurants \u2013 and high social-security taxes. Michelin stars became increasingly expensive to maintain. In 1996, Pierre Gagnaire\u2019s three-star restaurant went bankrupt. In 2003 the chef Bernard Loiseau, in debt and losing customers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/feb/27/guardianobituaries.carolineboucher\" title=\"\">shot himself</a> after hearing rumours that he was going to lose his third Michelin star. In the average French restaurant, in the everyday bistros, the situation was dire. Restaurant owners complained that it had become exorbitantly expensive to hire workers and almost impossible to fire them.</p> <p>The crisis grew. In 2010, a documentary expos\u00e9 on French TV channel Canal Plus broadcast undercover footage from inside the giant warehouse of an industrial caterer showing restaurateurs piling frozen ready meals into giant shopping carts. By one estimation, 70% of restaurants were using pre-prepared or frozen ingredients or sauces. It was clear that restaurants could no longer afford to employ people to peel potatoes, chop carrots, mince garlic, pick through parsley and all the other time-consuming jobs at the bottom of the food chain. Much easier to just buy the pre-prepped version and reheat it.</p> <p>What I had noticed as gravied blandness had become a national scandal. The government intervened to save the French restaurant. In 2009, they reduced VAT (it went down to 5.5%, and is now at 10%) and a few years later introduced a new labelling system for restaurants, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/jul/15/france-fait-maison-homemade-law-save-reputation\" title=\"\">fait maison</a></em>, made in-house, to indicate that dishes were freshly prepared. However, there were so many exemptions allowed \u2013 vegetables, except for potatoes, could be bought frozen, ready-peeled and chopped \u2013 that the designation was a pretty useless marker of quality.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Conservation can breed conservatism. Over the decades, French cuisine has been increasingly codified. The system of <em>appellation d\u2019origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e</em>, a governmental designation that creates legal labelling criteria for the provenance and quality of food products, was introduced in 1935 and now encompasses over 300 wines, 46 cheeses, and foods such as Puy lentils and Corsican honey. The famous Bresse chicken, with its tricolore colouring of blue feet, white feathers and red cockscomb, must be raised with a minimum of 10 sq metres of pasture per bird, finished and fattened on grain for two weeks and then killed at minimum age of four months and a minimum weight of 1.2kg, before it can be certified with a special metal ring around its dead leg stamped with the name of the producer.</p> <p>At the same time, France has developed exacting professional qualifications for its chefs, <em>patissiers</em>, bakers, butchers, <em>charcutiers</em>, <em>chocolatiers</em>. The CAP diploma (<em>certificat</em><em> d\u2019aptitude professionnelle</em>, which also covers plumbers, electricians, hairdressers and other trades) \u2013 is almost a prerequisite to working in culinary fields. For example, you can bake and sell bread without a CAP diploma, but for the first three years, you are not allowed to put up a sign that says <em>Boulangerie</em>. These trades are further organised into professional guilds and confederations, each with their own criteria for inclusion.</p> <p>There is also a prestigious state competition open to many trades, from stonemasons to sommeliers. Over several days of tests, those few who are deemed by their peers in the profession to have qualified receive the title of <em>un des meilleurs ouvriers</em> \u2013 one of the best craftspeople in France \u2013 and earn the right to wear a tricoleur collar. (Just watch the 2009 documentary <a href=\"https://dogwoof.com/kingsofpastry\" title=\"\">Kings of Pastry</a>, to understand the rigour and tears and seriousness with which this distinction is won. The pastry event is held every four years, entry is by invitation and only three or four patissieres will be judged worthy to ascend to the ranks of <em>Meilleur Ouvrier</em>.)</p> <p>There are also many gastronomic associations that celebrate and preserve specific dishes and maintain the traditional versions of <em>t\u00eate de veau</em>, <em>cassoulet</em>, <em>andouille</em>, <em>boudin</em> and regional specialities such as the black figs of Caromb and cherries of Venasque. These associations confer and organise awards, badges, dinners, festivals and competitions. I once met two representatives of the Association to Safeguard the <em>Oeuf Mayonnaise</em>, who were very happy to explain, without any irony, the criteria for an excellent example of the form. \u201cIt depends on the eggs, their freshness, how well they are cooked, and then the nap of the mayonnaise must be perfect \u2013 it should cover the eggs and not fall down too easily.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b61b2862328a55245c996b88cd1ec52179100dfa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b61b2862328a55245c996b88cd1ec52179100dfa/0_162_1992_1195/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Henri Gault (left) and Christian Millau, co-founders of the nouvelle cuisine movement.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Henri Gault (left) and Christian Millau, co-founders of the nouvelle cuisine movement.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacques Langevin/Associated Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is all a great celebration of a grand culinary legacy, but there is a danger of tradition being codified into obsolescence, creativity shackled by specifications and rules. There has always been a tension in French restaurant kitchens between tradition and innovation. In the late 60s, a young generation of chefs revolted against the old order, as the rupture between the old and the young in the violence and general strike of 1968 pushed change in restaurants, too. They rebelled against Car\u00eame\u2019s gluey, flour-thickened gravies and began to make sauces out of vegetables and herbs.</p> <p>This movement became known as nouvelle cuisine<em> </em>and was championed by a new guide that hoped to overthrow Michelin\u2019s regime. In 1973, its eponymous editors Henri Gault and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/aug/24/christian-millau-obituary\" title=\"\">Christian Millau</a> issued their manifesto: \u201cDown with the old-fashioned image of the typical <em>bon vivant</em>, that puffy personage with his napkin tucked under his chin, his lips dripping veal stock \u2026 no more of those terrible brown sauces and white sauces, those <em>espagnoles</em>, those <em>p\u00e9rigueux</em> with truffles, those <em>b\u00e9chamels</em> and <em>mornays</em> that have assassinated as many livers as they have covered indifferent foods. They are forbidden!\u201d</p> <p>Nouvelle cuisine focused on simplicity. At the forefront of the new cooking, the Troisgros Brothers\u2019 salmon with sorrel was as famous for its fresh acidity as it was for its pretty colours: pink and vivid green. For the first time, French chefs sent out dishes already carefully arranged on the plate. Gone were the table-side theatrics of flamb\u00e9eing and carving, pressing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/video/2010/nov/23/pressed-duck-tour-dargent-paris\" title=\"\">whole duck carcasses in silver duck presses</a> and quenelling sorbet; waiters were relegated to ferrying plates. But the plates were as pretty as a picture and, for the first time, chefs\u2019 cookbooks began to heavily feature glossy colour photographs. Nouvelle cuisine was as much as aesthetic revolution as it was a culinary one.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jun/04/bon-appetit-how-i-rediscoved-the-joys-of-french-cuisine\">Bon app\u00e9tit! How I rediscovered the joys of French cuisine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is much that modern chefs and their happy customers owe to the nouvelle cuisine movement \u2013 the art of plating, fish lightly cooked to opalescent instead of woolly, the liberal use of herbs \u2013 but at the time, plenty of people liked to laugh at the fussiness of the presentation and complained that the portions were too small. Innovations and the reactions to them have always been part of the kitchen table debate. In 1996, several well-known French chefs including Jo\u00ebl Robuchon, of mashed-potato fame, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/mar/08/grace-dent-reviews-alain-ducasse-15-pound-cup-of-coffee\" title=\"\">Alain Ducasse</a>, probably the most famous French chef alive today, issued a manifesto denouncing the \u201cglobalisation of cuisine\u201d and innovation for its own sake. Eighteen months after the reactionary manifesto, opposing chefs of equal stature \u2013 known as the \u201cgroup of eight\u201d \u2013 fired back, rejecting nostalgia in favour of experimentation in the kitchen.</p> <p>It is tempting to draw a neat loop from culinary conservatism to culinary cul-de-sacs, but this isn\u2019t really fair. France has consistently produced extraordinary chefs cooking extraordinary food. This year, The World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants, the list first published in 2002 that has largely replaced Michelin as a global guide to top restaurants, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jun/25/uk-falls-down-culinary-rankings-in-worlds-50-best-restaurants-list\" title=\"\">ranked Mirazur</a> in the south of France as No 1. It\u2019s more the general mid-level restaurant culture that had got stuck, but in France, just like everywhere else, the internet has been breaking down frontiers and collapsing distances between trends and ideas and dishes.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In the new global foodie zeitgeist, a younger generation of chefs are now establishing themselves in French kitchens. Increasingly, they have trained in restaurants in London, New York, Copenhagen or Barcelona. When I came back to Paris in 2014, after four years away, a new era was in full swing. The hip new places used jam\u00f3n Ib\u00e9rico, turmeric and yuzu in their dishes, eschewed tablecloths and had pared a new \u201cbistronomy\u201d movement back to bare wooden tabletops, small plates and handwritten menus that changed daily. Just as before, they were championed by a new restaurant guide, Le Fooding, founded in 2000, which, with its Anglo-ish name, illustrated a new openness to global influences. This was all very welcome, delicious and fun. But often it felt as if France was borrowing from other food cultures \u2013 there was a lot of raw-fish appetisers, main courses <em>a la plancha,</em> and the ubiquitous <em>burrata</em> \u2013 rather than reinventing or reinvigorating its own.</p> <p>For a long time, I felt as if good French food in Paris were the domain of a few almost prohibitively expensive, old-faithful restaurants, while the smattering of newer places were uber-chic and often booked up. The perfect bistro around the corner no longer seemed to exist. Of course, this is personal observation; everyone has their finds and their favorites. But where I live in Montmartre (a touristy area, it\u2019s true), the classic French restaurant where the locals go \u2013 a large, jolly place with great platters of <em>fruits de mer </em>and fleets of waiters \u2013 easily cost us well over \u20ac100 for two, without much wine or dessert. For many years, Chartier was my stand-by, and the only <em>bouillon</em> in Paris providing a cheap but hearty sit-down meal. Suddenly, in the past year or so, three others have opened. They have been so successful that their proprietors are planning to open more.</p> <p>Back to basics is proving popular. The Bouillon Pigalle opened in my neighbourhood a little over a year ago, an updated version of the genre. The space is modern and bright with clean lines, but the old, familiar style of decor has been respected; the banquettes are red and long baggage racks run above the tables, although these days people put their motorcycle helmets on them, not their hats. The young manager, Jean Christophe, told me that for the menu they had deliberately returned to nostalgia. \u201cThere are hamburgers and Caesar salad everywhere, but we can\u2019t find our cultural recipes. We thought: \u2018What can we do that reminds us of our grandmother\u2019s cooking?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7ba6c280f02de06b9212d397569f13cc38b38860\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ba6c280f02de06b9212d397569f13cc38b38860/0_310_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bouillon Pigalle in Paris.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The new wave \u2026 Bouillon Pigalle in Paris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frederic Vielcanet/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the menu is <em>celeri remoulade</em>, herring in oil with potatoes, marrow bones, <em>escargots</em>, cauliflower cheese, <em>boeuf bourguignon</em>, <em>pot-au-feu</em>, <em>blanquette de veau</em>, roast chicken with frites. You can eat a starter, a main course, have a glass or two of wine and come out with change from a \u20ac20 note. The food is very good, but it\u2019s not going to stick in your memory, change the way you think about food, or make you hanker for a certain dish for years afterwards.</p> <p>Maybe we are now surrounded by so much variety and plenty that we have lost our ability to be amazed by food in the way my parents once were. Maybe what we think we remember about the glories of the French restaurant \u2013 because nostalgia is really a false memory, the longing for something that never really existed \u2013 is not really the meal, but the unexpected pleasure of the meal, the discovery of deliciousness. <em>\u00c0 la recherche du temps perdu</em>; the ability to be surprised by something we eat is a mouthful of madeleine that is long gone.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/may/15/has-wine-gone-bad-organic-biodynamic-natural-wine\">Has wine gone bad?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps restaurants are less about the food than we think, and our relationship with them is more emotional and social than gustatory. When I asked a group of French restaurateurs what was the most important ingredient to a restaurant they answered, in unison, \u201c<em>ambiance</em>\u201d \u2013 the feel of the place. The last time I had dinner at Bouillon Pigalle I watched people at tables talking, plotting, flirting, celebrating. There were old people, solo diners, tourist families, couples on a date. The tables are side-by-side so you rub elbows with your neighbour, pass the salt, swap menu advice, get chatting. I realised that this is the fun and flow of the French restaurant experience. The waiter brought another <em>demi-carafe </em>of wine, conversation sparked and hummed, one table sang happy birthday, another was laughing loudly. The French after all, are master purveyors of <em>joie-de-vivre.</em> At Bouillon Pigalle, the line is permanently out the door.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

It was meant to be temporary; at the time I was just looking for somewhere to hole up and finish a book. My friends all said: \u201cOh Paris, how lovely! You must be eating well.\u201d They were surprised to hear me complain that Parisian menus were dull and repetitive. \u201cPat\u00e9 followed by nothing but entrec\u00f4te, entrec\u00f4te, entrec\u00f4te. Occasionally roast lamb, duck breast. No vegetables to speak of,\u201d I told them. \u201cIt\u2019s a tyranny of meat-in-brown-sauce.\u201d As the rest of the world had begun to (re)discover their own cuisines and innovate, the French restaurant seemed to be stagnating in a pool of congealing demi-glace. Elsewhere, places such as Balthazar in New York and the Wolseley in London seemed to be doing the French restaurant better than the French. In France, the old guard of critics and restaurateurs remained convinced that French cuisine was still the best in the world and a point of national pride. The bistros cleaved to the traditional red-and-white checked table cloths and chalked-up menus even as they were microwaving pre-prepared boeuf bourguignon in the back. In 2010, when the French restaurant meal was added to Unesco\u2019s list of the world\u2019s \u201cintangible cultural heritage\u201d, it felt as if the French restaurant had become a museum piece, and a parody of itself. The perceived excellence of their cuisine and restaurants has long represented a vital part of French national identity. It was too easy to ascribe this decline to a certain national conservatism, complacency and parochialism \u2013 facile Anglo-Saxon taunts. The real story is more complicated. The restaurant business always has been subject to changes in society and economic circumstances. Food \u2013 what we eat and how we go out to eat it \u2013 is constantly evolving, according to trend and time. I left France for four years between 2010 and 2014. When I returned to Paris, things had changed. Australians had established Italian coffee bars and you could finally get a decent cappuccino. New cocktail bars had appeared and trendy cafes were making mojitos with real lime juice. Le Hamburger was all the rage. Parisians had embraced Asian food in a big way \u2013 ramen counters proliferated, a cover article last year for Le Monde Magazine\u2019s gastronomy special was entitled L\u2019Asie Majeure, which can be roughly translated as \u201cthe Asian wave\u201d. Even the white-haired doge of French chefs, the great Alain Ducasse, admitted that his ideal lunch was cold soba noodles. New flavours and a new informality to dining were taking hold, but at the same time, more than 200 years of restaurant culture is a formidable and loved institution. The question is how to manage tradition: what to keep and what to update? * * * For my parents\u2019 generation, and for 100 years before them, it was axiomatic that French food was the best in the world. In 1948, aged 13, my father was taken by his uncle to lunch at La Pyramide, a restaurant in the south-eastern town of Vienne. It was an experience that changed his life. Dad had grown up at boarding school in the Highlands during wartime privation and rationing: powdered egg, burnt toast, chilblains. The effect of his encounter with the cuisine of Fernand Point, France\u2019s most celebrated chef at the time, was profound. He had no idea that food could taste like that. Bresse chicken scented with tarragon and creamy potatoes dauphinoise seemed to melt on his tongue. He was impressed by the theatre of the service, the chocolate abundance of dessert trolley and the sommelier\u2019s embossed silver tastevin worn around his neck as proudly the gorget of a Napoleonic marshal (Dad was always a great fan of Napoleon). My father\u2019s life, and happily for me, the lives of his children, too, were shaped by that meal. We grew up cross-channel ferrying to Michelin-starred destinations, eating frogs\u2019 legs with our fingers, tasting wine we were too young to drink, learning the etiquettes of napkins-in-laps and fish forks. By the time he was six, my little brother liked to order six snails to start and then a dozen for the main course. Such culinary epiphanies as my father\u2019s were not uncommon in the 20th century. The biographies of great chefs and Francophile memoirs \u2013 Hemingway, AJ Liebling, Julia Child \u2013 are full of them. A dozen oysters and a bottle of Chablis seemed to banish the successive miseries of the first world war, the Great Depression and the second world war. A generous plate of cassoulet or blanquette de veau was counterfoil to the industrialised conveniences of late 20th-century consumerism: supermarkets, packets of crisps, cans of soup. In Britain and America, it seemed as if we had lost our links to the land and its bounty. France was different. Back then, the best restaurants were French, and recipes were prepared according to the instructions of the great 19th-century French chefs Auguste Escoffier and Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame, and described even on English menus in italicised French: \u00e0 la \u2013 chasseur, bordelaise, armoricaine. French was the epitome of what food \u2013 a chicken or a piece of beef chuck or a carrot \u2013 could aspire to be. \u201cOh, in France you can\u2019t eat a bad meal!\u201d I remember my mother saying in my childhood. It was a common remark in the era. \u201cEven in the routiers [truck stops],\u201d my mother declared, \u201cthe frites are fresh and the saucisson delicious.\u201d Fernand Point famously held that in order to master a dish you must cook it 100 times. He was as fastidious as he was fat. \u201cLook at the chef,\u201d he advised. \u201cIf he is thin, you will probably dine poorly.\u201d His cuisine married the two strands of French restaurant cuisine: tradition and terroir; Paris and the provinces. On the paternal side, the 19th-century tradition of feeding rich people richly: Car\u00eame\u2019s pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance confections, spun-sugar towers, souffl\u00e9es and vol-au-vents and Escoffier\u2019s artful flatteries marketed for a new age of celebrity; Tournedos Rossini, named after the famous composer; Peach Melba, after Nellie Melba the celebrated opera singer; strawberries \u00e0 la Sarah Bernhardt (with pineapple and Cura\u00e7ao sorbet). From the female side, Point took inspiration from generations of mothers, the cuisine familiale of peasants who lived and cooked close to the land, slowly braising one-pot dishes in the hearth: daube de boeuf, cassoulet, pot-au-feu, coq au vin. In many ways, Point\u2019s food represents the apex of classical French cuisine. Earthy yet refined, it relied on impeccable ingredients. The recipes in his cookbook, Ma Gastronomie, are almost absurdly simple. Very little is added to the main ingredient; a knob of butter, a ladle of stock, a handful of morels or a few tarragon leaves. Perhaps Point\u2019s most enduring legacy is the idea that great cooking is about elevating the essential taste of each individual ingredient. But it is also a sticking point. I remember having an argument with my French boyfriend because I suggested marinating the chicken for dinner in yoghurt and cumin. Boyfriend threw up his arms in alarm. \u201cBut isn\u2019t the point to taste the chicken?\u201d Furious and foreign, I replied: \u201cNo! It\u2019s just the opposite! Cooking is about messing with the chicken! Cooking is about adding flavour!\u201d Here was the rub between French culinary conservatism and the way we in Britain and America have magpied ingredients from all over the world and made national favourites out of hybrid curries and Tex-Mex. For more than 200 years, France was the centre of culinary endeavour \u2013 the place where chefs aspired to train and where restaurateurs looked for inspiration \u2013 but this was changing. At the turn of the millennium, when Ferran and Albert Adri\u00e0 at El Bulli in Spain were inventing molecular gastronomy by spherifying melon juice, France\u2019s great chef du jour, Jo\u00ebl Robuchon, was perfecting mashed potatoes. There is no doubt that Robuchon\u2019s pur\u00e9e is probably the most extraordinary mouthful of potato you will swallow, but my own La Pyramide moment came at El Bulli in 2004 when I ate through the Adri\u00e0 brothers\u2019 imagination. I still remember every dish: an egg yolk encased in a transparent ravioli; a perfect rectangle of silver sardine with a black dot of fish guts reduced to essential umami. It changed not only the way I thought about food, but the way I thought about life. (Why follow rules? What are boundaries? What delicious joy to think beyond such constraints!) In 1997 Adam Gopnik wrote a watershed article in the New Yorker, echoing what people had been whispering for a while: \u201cIs there a crisis in French cooking?\u201d Indeed, when I first arrived in Paris nine years later, there seemed to be. What had happened? * * * The restaurant is a modern invention and, crucially, a French one. Of course, there have always been inns and taverns where travellers could get a bite. But the atmosphere tended to be male, the fare rough and ready, the tables shared. The word \u201crestaurant\u201d originally referred to a restorative, a pick-me-up, a fortifier. In the 18th century, as Paris grew, butchers began to sell bouillons, nourishing broths made from offcuts of meat, to workers and tradesmen. These early soup stalls became known as restaurants; a 1786 decree allowed \u201ccaterers and restaurateurs [those who make fortifying soups]\u201d to serve the public on site. You could now sit down at a table to partake of your soup instead of having to take it away. This decree coincided with the construction of the Palais Royale, with its elegant arcades designed to house shops and ateliers (and, inevitably, brothels, in one of which, some have said, a young Lt Bonaparte lost his virginity) in the style of an Eastern bazaar. This new shopping mall necessitated a food court for peckish Parisians, and many of the early restaurants were located in and around it. Le Grand Vefour still occupies the same corner where there has been a restaurant since 1784. It is possibly the most beautiful restaurant in the world. Its walls are painted with nymphs and garlands in the style of Louis XVI remembering a Roman villa, and tables bear small plaques naming former patrons: Napoleon, Victor Hugo, Jean Cocteau, Jean-Paul Sartre. The French revolution swept the old order away. The guilds had carved up food into jealously guarded specialities \u2013 only charcutiers could cure sausage, only boulangers baked bread; a r\u00f4tissiseur could roast meats but was not permitted to bake a stew in an oven \u2013 but now they were broken up. Paris roiled with politics and plots, hungry pamphleteers and provincials; restaurants sprang up everywhere to feed them. And the food changed, too. The elaborate banquets of the ancien regime, in which whole animals were stuffed and dressed and placed all at the same time on the table, were replaced by dishes that were served by waiters from a platter \u2013 in the Russian style. The new restaurants embodied the changed times: a menu of choice, individual portions served to anyone who could pay. Democracy on a plate. Almost as soon as they had invented the restaurant, the French invented the restaurant scene. The first restaurant critic, Grimod de la Reyni\u00e8re, wrote reviews in his gazette, the Gourmet\u2019s Almanac. By the time Napoleon had been defeated for the first time, in 1814, the almanac listed more than 300 restaurants in Paris. The lexicon of cuisine soon followed. Marie-Antoine Car\u00eame was the first celebrity chef, who cooked for kings and emperors, and wrote the code of French cooking, categorising the five great mother sauces (b\u00e9chamel, espagnole, velout\u00e9, hollandaise and tomato) from which all others were derived. Later, Escoffier organised the restaurant kitchen into the strict hierarchy that still prevails today, from the commis chefs at the bottom, to the chefs de parties who oversee the different stations of meat or fish or cold starter, to the sous chef and the chef de cuisine. Meanwhile, Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, a lawyer who coined the term gastronome, had made the intellectual leap: enjoying food was not just a pleasurable distraction, he argued, but a civilising art of existential import. As he once wrote: \u201cTell me what you eat and I\u2019ll tell you what you are.\u201d All the grammar and idiom of what we know and understand as \u201ca restaurant\u201d was developed by the French in the 19th century. The menu, the progression of canap\u00e9s and hors d\u2019oeuvres followed by entr\u00e9e, plat and dessert, the accompanying march of aperitif, wine, coffee, digestif. The way a Ma\u00eetre D (Ma\u00eetre d\u2019h\u00f4tel, or master of the house) welcomes guests, the formality of the waiters wearing traditional black tie. There was a specific pomp and performance to a restaurant, that was different to a diner or a pub or a taverna. In time, it would come to connote a sophistication that became seen as the special preserve of the French \u2013 and, for us rude mechanical Anglo-Saxons, the height of our aspirations. Through the 19th century, the restaurant flourished and evolved. The bistro was a cheerful neighbourhood place, often run by a husband and wife. Brasseries were brewery eateries brought to Paris by Alsatian refugees from the Franco-Prussian war of 1870, serving choucroute and draught beer. Bouillons were popular, working-class cafeterias that served cheap food in vast dining rooms that could seat hundreds at a time. There were dozens of bouillons in Paris between 1850-1950. Several were chains \u2013 the first restaurant groups, perhaps even the first fast-food joints \u2014 reaping economies of scale by sourcing in bulk and flipping tables as fast as a revolving door. By the time I got to Paris there was only one left, Chartier, in a forgotten corner of the ninth arrondissement. I used to go there often for the everyday classics: oeuf dur mayonnaise, carottes rap\u00e9es, poulet-frites, t\u00eate de veau. It had nicotine-coloured walls and the chattery humidity of a winter lunchtime crowd, and I liked to imagine it was the kind of place where Orwell had washed dishes when he was down and out. During the Belle \u00c9poque, between the Franco-Prussian War and the next German invasion of France in 1914, Paris was the capital of the world. It embodied the breakneck speed and excitement of the times: cinema, Pasteur, the Eiffel Tower, aeroplanes, telephones, motor cars, impressionism, expressionism, cubism, Proust, Rimbaud, Diaghilev, art nouveau, haute couture and towering hats. Paris in the Belle \u00c9poque was zenith of style and taste; can there have ever been a better place and time in history to have enjoyed yourself? The French, as we all do, lament its passing. More than 100 years later, sometimes, as I would glance at a menu rich with foie gras, cream and beef, I would think they were consoling themselves by continuing to eat it. But by the time Lost Generation were carousing in its past glories in the 1920s, Paris was already living as a romanticised version of itself. AJ Liebling, later to become a war reporter covering D-Day and a famous New Yorker essayist, fell in love with French restaurants in his early 20s, even as plenty of older gourmets were lamenting that their heyday was over. For a long time after the second world war, no one noticed the decline of the French restaurant, partly because there was little competition. The British were boiling their vegetables to grey, and battering and frying everything else; the Americans were gelatinising salads and defrosting dinner. Chinese and Indian restaurants were still widely seen as cheap options (and still emulated the French with tablecloths and origami napkins), sushi was raw fish, and hardly anyone had been on holiday to Thailand or Morocco yet. * * * In the 70s my parents \u2013 like other foodies at the time \u2013 planned whole trips around the puffed asterisk recommendations of the Michelin Guide. Le Guide Michelin was first published in 1900 to encourage the early motorists to visit restaurants in the provinces, and soon became the grand arbiter of French cuisine. Obscure, definitive, conjuring an image of a lonely, corpulent inspector able to swallow whole goose livers in one gulp, Michelin had the power of a king to award stars and turn around the fortunes of a restaurant. But it also became a leviathan that focused on one kind of restaurant \u2013 those with formal dining rooms, white tablecloths and serried ranks of waiters. By the 90s, people had begun to complain that Michelin was hidebound and tended to favour its favourites. Fernand Point died in 1955, but Michelin continued to award La Pyramide three stars out of respect to his widow, who continued to run the restaurant, for more than 30 years until her death in 1986. By then, restaurant economics had become brutal. Even grand chefs were buckling under the expense of laundering their damask tablecloths to snowy Michelin standards. As Thatcher and Reagan were liberalising their economies, French president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand promised \u201ca break with capitalism\u201d. He raised the minimum wage, allotted French workers a fifth week of paid vacation, lowered the retirement age to 60, and cut the work week to 39 hours (it was later to reduced again to 35). The bill was piled on to sky-high VAT \u2013 19.5% for restaurants \u2013 and high social-security taxes. Michelin stars became increasingly expensive to maintain. In 1996, Pierre Gagnaire\u2019s three-star restaurant went bankrupt. In 2003 the chef Bernard Loiseau, in debt and losing customers, shot himself after hearing rumours that he was going to lose his third Michelin star. In the average French restaurant, in the everyday bistros, the situation was dire. Restaurant owners complained that it had become exorbitantly expensive to hire workers and almost impossible to fire them. The crisis grew. In 2010, a documentary expos\u00e9 on French TV channel Canal Plus broadcast undercover footage from inside the giant warehouse of an industrial caterer showing restaurateurs piling frozen ready meals into giant shopping carts. By one estimation, 70% of restaurants were using pre-prepared or frozen ingredients or sauces. It was clear that restaurants could no longer afford to employ people to peel potatoes, chop carrots, mince garlic, pick through parsley and all the other time-consuming jobs at the bottom of the food chain. Much easier to just buy the pre-prepped version and reheat it. What I had noticed as gravied blandness had become a national scandal. The government intervened to save the French restaurant. In 2009, they reduced VAT (it went down to 5.5%, and is now at 10%) and a few years later introduced a new labelling system for restaurants, fait maison, made in-house, to indicate that dishes were freshly prepared. However, there were so many exemptions allowed \u2013 vegetables, except for potatoes, could be bought frozen, ready-peeled and chopped \u2013 that the designation was a pretty useless marker of quality. * * * Conservation can breed conservatism. Over the decades, French cuisine has been increasingly codified. The system of appellation d\u2019origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e, a governmental designation that creates legal labelling criteria for the provenance and quality of food products, was introduced in 1935 and now encompasses over 300 wines, 46 cheeses, and foods such as Puy lentils and Corsican honey. The famous Bresse chicken, with its tricolore colouring of blue feet, white feathers and red cockscomb, must be raised with a minimum of 10 sq metres of pasture per bird, finished and fattened on grain for two weeks and then killed at minimum age of four months and a minimum weight of 1.2kg, before it can be certified with a special metal ring around its dead leg stamped with the name of the producer. At the same time, France has developed exacting professional qualifications for its chefs, patissiers, bakers, butchers, charcutiers, chocolatiers. The CAP diploma (certificat d\u2019aptitude professionnelle, which also covers plumbers, electricians, hairdressers and other trades) \u2013 is almost a prerequisite to working in culinary fields. For example, you can bake and sell bread without a CAP diploma, but for the first three years, you are not allowed to put up a sign that says Boulangerie. These trades are further organised into professional guilds and confederations, each with their own criteria for inclusion. There is also a prestigious state competition open to many trades, from stonemasons to sommeliers. Over several days of tests, those few who are deemed by their peers in the profession to have qualified receive the title of un des meilleurs ouvriers \u2013 one of the best craftspeople in France \u2013 and earn the right to wear a tricoleur collar. (Just watch the 2009 documentary Kings of Pastry, to understand the rigour and tears and seriousness with which this distinction is won. The pastry event is held every four years, entry is by invitation and only three or four patissieres will be judged worthy to ascend to the ranks of Meilleur Ouvrier.) There are also many gastronomic associations that celebrate and preserve specific dishes and maintain the traditional versions of t\u00eate de veau, cassoulet, andouille, boudin and regional specialities such as the black figs of Caromb and cherries of Venasque. These associations confer and organise awards, badges, dinners, festivals and competitions. I once met two representatives of the Association to Safeguard the Oeuf Mayonnaise, who were very happy to explain, without any irony, the criteria for an excellent example of the form. \u201cIt depends on the eggs, their freshness, how well they are cooked, and then the nap of the mayonnaise must be perfect \u2013 it should cover the eggs and not fall down too easily.\u201d This is all a great celebration of a grand culinary legacy, but there is a danger of tradition being codified into obsolescence, creativity shackled by specifications and rules. There has always been a tension in French restaurant kitchens between tradition and innovation. In the late 60s, a young generation of chefs revolted against the old order, as the rupture between the old and the young in the violence and general strike of 1968 pushed change in restaurants, too. They rebelled against Car\u00eame\u2019s gluey, flour-thickened gravies and began to make sauces out of vegetables and herbs. This movement became known as nouvelle cuisine and was championed by a new guide that hoped to overthrow Michelin\u2019s regime. In 1973, its eponymous editors Henri Gault and Christian Millau issued their manifesto: \u201cDown with the old-fashioned image of the typical bon vivant, that puffy personage with his napkin tucked under his chin, his lips dripping veal stock \u2026 no more of those terrible brown sauces and white sauces, those espagnoles, those p\u00e9rigueux with truffles, those b\u00e9chamels and mornays that have assassinated as many livers as they have covered indifferent foods. They are forbidden!\u201d Nouvelle cuisine focused on simplicity. At the forefront of the new cooking, the Troisgros Brothers\u2019 salmon with sorrel was as famous for its fresh acidity as it was for its pretty colours: pink and vivid green. For the first time, French chefs sent out dishes already carefully arranged on the plate. Gone were the table-side theatrics of flamb\u00e9eing and carving, pressing whole duck carcasses in silver duck presses and quenelling sorbet; waiters were relegated to ferrying plates. But the plates were as pretty as a picture and, for the first time, chefs\u2019 cookbooks began to heavily feature glossy colour photographs. Nouvelle cuisine was as much as aesthetic revolution as it was a culinary one. There is much that modern chefs and their happy customers owe to the nouvelle cuisine movement \u2013 the art of plating, fish lightly cooked to opalescent instead of woolly, the liberal use of herbs \u2013 but at the time, plenty of people liked to laugh at the fussiness of the presentation and complained that the portions were too small. Innovations and the reactions to them have always been part of the kitchen table debate. In 1996, several well-known French chefs including Jo\u00ebl Robuchon, of mashed-potato fame, and Alain Ducasse, probably the most famous French chef alive today, issued a manifesto denouncing the \u201cglobalisation of cuisine\u201d and innovation for its own sake. Eighteen months after the reactionary manifesto, opposing chefs of equal stature \u2013 known as the \u201cgroup of eight\u201d \u2013 fired back, rejecting nostalgia in favour of experimentation in the kitchen. It is tempting to draw a neat loop from culinary conservatism to culinary cul-de-sacs, but this isn\u2019t really fair. France has consistently produced extraordinary chefs cooking extraordinary food. This year, The World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants, the list first published in 2002 that has largely replaced Michelin as a global guide to top restaurants, ranked Mirazur in the south of France as No 1. It\u2019s more the general mid-level restaurant culture that had got stuck, but in France, just like everywhere else, the internet has been breaking down frontiers and collapsing distances between trends and ideas and dishes. * * * In the new global foodie zeitgeist, a younger generation of chefs are now establishing themselves in French kitchens. Increasingly, they have trained in restaurants in London, New York, Copenhagen or Barcelona. When I came back to Paris in 2014, after four years away, a new era was in full swing. The hip new places used jam\u00f3n Ib\u00e9rico, turmeric and yuzu in their dishes, eschewed tablecloths and had pared a new \u201cbistronomy\u201d movement back to bare wooden tabletops, small plates and handwritten menus that changed daily. Just as before, they were championed by a new restaurant guide, Le Fooding, founded in 2000, which, with its Anglo-ish name, illustrated a new openness to global influences. This was all very welcome, delicious and fun. But often it felt as if France was borrowing from other food cultures \u2013 there was a lot of raw-fish appetisers, main courses a la plancha, and the ubiquitous burrata \u2013 rather than reinventing or reinvigorating its own. For a long time, I felt as if good French food in Paris were the domain of a few almost prohibitively expensive, old-faithful restaurants, while the smattering of newer places were uber-chic and often booked up. The perfect bistro around the corner no longer seemed to exist. Of course, this is personal observation; everyone has their finds and their favorites. But where I live in Montmartre (a touristy area, it\u2019s true), the classic French restaurant where the locals go \u2013 a large, jolly place with great platters of fruits de mer and fleets of waiters \u2013 easily cost us well over \u20ac100 for two, without much wine or dessert. For many years, Chartier was my stand-by, and the only bouillon in Paris providing a cheap but hearty sit-down meal. Suddenly, in the past year or so, three others have opened. They have been so successful that their proprietors are planning to open more. Back to basics is proving popular. The Bouillon Pigalle opened in my neighbourhood a little over a year ago, an updated version of the genre. The space is modern and bright with clean lines, but the old, familiar style of decor has been respected; the banquettes are red and long baggage racks run above the tables, although these days people put their motorcycle helmets on them, not their hats. The young manager, Jean Christophe, told me that for the menu they had deliberately returned to nostalgia. \u201cThere are hamburgers and Caesar salad everywhere, but we can\u2019t find our cultural recipes. We thought: \u2018What can we do that reminds us of our grandmother\u2019s cooking?\u2019\u201d On the menu is celeri remoulade, herring in oil with potatoes, marrow bones, escargots, cauliflower cheese, boeuf bourguignon, pot-au-feu, blanquette de veau, roast chicken with frites. You can eat a starter, a main course, have a glass or two of wine and come out with change from a \u20ac20 note. The food is very good, but it\u2019s not going to stick in your memory, change the way you think about food, or make you hanker for a certain dish for years afterwards. Maybe we are now surrounded by so much variety and plenty that we have lost our ability to be amazed by food in the way my parents once were. Maybe what we think we remember about the glories of the French restaurant \u2013 because nostalgia is really a false memory, the longing for something that never really existed \u2013 is not really the meal, but the unexpected pleasure of the meal, the discovery of deliciousness. \u00c0 la recherche du temps perdu; the ability to be surprised by something we eat is a mouthful of madeleine that is long gone. Perhaps restaurants are less about the food than we think, and our relationship with them is more emotional and social than gustatory. When I asked a group of French restaurateurs what was the most important ingredient to a restaurant they answered, in unison, \u201cambiance\u201d \u2013 the feel of the place. The last time I had dinner at Bouillon Pigalle I watched people at tables talking, plotting, flirting, celebrating. There were old people, solo diners, tourist families, couples on a date. The tables are side-by-side so you rub elbows with your neighbour, pass the salt, swap menu advice, get chatting. I realised that this is the fun and flow of the French restaurant experience. The waiter brought another demi-carafe of wine, conversation sparked and hummed, one table sang happy birthday, another was laughing loudly. The French after all, are master purveyors of joie-de-vivre. At Bouillon Pigalle, the line is permanently out the door. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

Plastic in what we wear may be less visible than it is in bottles or straws, but it is no less toxic.

Now there are moves \u2013 at the top and bottom of a complex global supply chain \u2013 to do something about it.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I started doing this five years ago, suppliers wouldn\u2019t even show me their recycled fabrics or they wouldn\u2019t even have them in their bag,\u201d says Kimberley Smith, head of production at a US clothing company Everlane. Since her company committed to eradicating all non-recycled, or virgin, plastic from its supply chain, stores and offices by 2021, her job has become a mission to demand more of them. \u201cNow, recycled is the first thing they show us,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>But that mission is also about fighting apathy and ignorance among shoppers. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more pressure now to be more educated about issues like water and air pollution, but I think people aren\u2019t as clear that, \u2018Oh, by the way, your know your fleece or your Puffa jacket is made of virgin oil?\u2019 I don\u2019t think people understand,\u201d says Smith, who has previously worked at Gap and Levi\u2019s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af8bb60a334c4ca814ae7c096c9b2bcb034a36bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af8bb60a334c4ca814ae7c096c9b2bcb034a36bd/0_0_5421_6000/904.jpg\" alt=\"ReNew by Everlane: a collection of outerwear and fleece made entirely from recycled plastic bottles.\" width=\"904\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">ReNew by Everlane: a collection of outerwear and fleece made entirely from recycled plastic bottles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everlane</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perhaps the development of synthetic fibres as a way to mimic natural fabrics \u2013 and add clever functionality \u2013 helped obscure the plastic in so much of what we now wear.

How often do you wear a T-shirt bought for \u00a34? And what do you do with yours once it has lost its shape or fallen apart (if it hasn\u2019t already disappeared at the bottom of a drawer of similarly priced clothing)? A return to using more cotton would alleviate the plastics problem, but no fast fashion is truly green; it can take up to 22,500 litres of water to grow a kilo of cotton in parts of India that are already water-deprived. Moreover, there are things that cotton can\u2019t do, such as keep the rain out or repel sweat.</p> <p>Production of polyester alone has multiplied 10 times since 1980, to 53.7 million tonnes in 2017, <a href=\"https://www.ecotlc.fr/ressources/Documents_site/2018-Preferred-Fiber-Materials-Market-Report.pdf\" title=\"\">according to data</a> collated by the Textile Exchange, a US nonprofit industry body. Polyester now accounts for 51% of all fibre production, twice that of cotton (synthetic fibre production overtook cotton in the mid-1990s). That\u2019s a lot of oil, energy and air miles. Yet we throw away an estimated 48 million tonnes of clothing of all types each year, 75% of which ends up in landfill or is incinerated. Less than 1% of clothing was recycled into new clothing in 2017.</p> <p>And plastic clothing can be uniquely toxic, even while it is still in use or after it has been recycled. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/20/microfibers-plastic-pollution-oceans-patagonia-synthetic-clothes-microbeads\">2016 study</a> by the University of California at Santa Barbara found that, on average, polyester fleece jackets release 1.7 grams of plastic microfibres each time they go into the wash. Older jackets shed more and almost half the barely visible fibres made it through water-treatment plants into rivers and seas. Microbeads of the sort used in cosmetics were banned in the UK last year, but microfibres may be just as destructive \u2013 and prevalent. A <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X16307639\" title=\"\">Plymouth University study</a> estimated in 2016 that a single six-kilo load of synthetic laundry could release 700,000 tiny bits of fibre. Their toxic effects have been observed concentrating as they pass up the food chain, devastating marine life and, in an unappetising case of unwanted recycling, <a href=\"https://choice.npr.org/index.html?origin=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2017/02/06/511843443/are-we-eating-our-fleece-jackets-microfibers-are-migrating-into-field-and-food?t=1563185152793\" title=\"\">ending up on our dinner plates</a>.</p> <p>The basic technology needed to dress a growing global population more sustainably has existed for decades. \u201cWe launched our first recycled polyester fleece in 1993,\u201d says Matt Dwyer, director of materials innovation at the US-based outdoor-clothing giant Patagonia. The fleece now lives in the company\u2019s archives and is still a faded pale green \u2013 it was made of discarded plastic bottles before green and clear bottles were separated. \u201cI\u2019ve handled it and it\u2019s a bit crispy now and the quality wasn\u2019t quite there, but that\u2019s not the story now,\u201d Dwyer adds. More than 80% of the synthetic material Patagonia uses is now recycled and that proportion should hit 90% in the next year.</p> <p>By sorting and processing old plastic into shreds and then turning them into chips, recycled-fibre producers such as the US-based Unifi, which makes Repreve, a recycled fibre, can spin the chips back into yarn. Unifi alone has processed more than 16bn bottles since 2008, and hopes to hit 30bn by 2022. The company supplies Patagonia as well as brands including Ford, for which it makes seat coverings.</p> <p>Dwyer says myths that remain about recycled materials often become excuses. There is an assumption that there isn\u2019t enough of it (\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of waste that needs picking up,\u201d he says), that it\u2019s still low-quality and that \u2013 crucially, in an industry of tight margins \u2013 it\u2019s too expensive. \u201cAny business of reasonable size can buy enough recycled material to defer costs,\u201d Dwyer adds. Perhaps more tellingly, there has not been a sense of demand from the bottom. \u201cThat\u2019s the other big excuse: \u2018My customer doesn\u2019t care so why should I?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Patagonia is now an industry poster child for sustainable fashion and Dwyer receives regular calls from other companies starting from zero. They all ask the same question: \u201cWhere do we start?\u201d Dwyer advises them first simply to ask suppliers where their stuff comes from. \u201cThe other thing I tell them is that making supply chains traceable and using recycled materials is future-proofing, because at some point your customer will care or \u2013 worse \u2013 it will get legislated and you\u2019ll have to change anyway,\u201d Dwyer says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29a90d5a224ea987e9b82d7c1f02dc97c657dc4d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29a90d5a224ea987e9b82d7c1f02dc97c657dc4d/0_0_1941_1076/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fashion brand Boohoo has launched its first recycled range.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"554\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fashion brand Boohoo has launched its first recycled range.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Boohoo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Companies are waking up to this future with varying degrees of commitment. Stella McCartney wants to phase out virgin nylon by 2020 and polyester by 2025. In the mass market, Adidas has committed to using recycled polyester in all viable applications by 2024. Meanwhile, brands such as Asos and Boohoo, which are synonymous with the excesses of fast fashion, have set out their stalls \u2013 or, at least, stalls within their stores. Asos has grown its Eco Edit since its launch in 2010. To qualify, clothing must contain at least 50% \u201csustainable\u201d fibres, including recycled plastics. Last month, Boohoo launched For the Future, the brand\u2019s first recycled range (\u201cDress well and do your bit for the planet? We\u2019re totally here for it.\u201d).</p> <p>But is there not a risk of greenwashing when brands whose business models rely on cheap fashion position themselves as environmental crusaders? \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make a big statement and put it out there,\u201d says Smith at Everlane. \u201cSaying, \u2018We\u2019re going to start a little baby eco line,\u2019 is better than nothing but by setting a real target and telling everyone about it, you\u2019re like: \u2018OK, now we\u2019ve really got to do it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>On Boohoo\u2019s homepage at the time of writing, the link to the recycled range, which includes a T-shirt for \u00a35.40, comes some distance below a \u201c50% off absolutely everything\u201d banner, a link to the summer and swimwear range with the slogan \u201ccatch flights not feelings\u201d and right next to a link to non-recycled plastic swimsuits on sale for \u00a35. There is nothing on Asos\u2019s homepage to indicate it has an \u201ceco\u201d range (now called the Responsible Edit) \u2013 I have to click through to find it. Boohoo says its new range was more prominent on its site at launch and that it is only \u201cthe latest in a line of initiatives designed to make it easier for our customers to do the right thing\u201d. Asos says it promotes its ethical range through several channels beyond its homepage and has added \u201cresponsible\u201d filters to all its ranges rather than confining the clothes to one page.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e6b3caa46471bd0e18ab1f708457dd15b1c4f62f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6b3caa46471bd0e18ab1f708457dd15b1c4f62f/311_140_3043_3273/930.jpg\" alt=\"Patagonia Cloud Ridge jacket, using recycled fabric.\" width=\"930\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patagonia Cloud Ridge jacket, using recycled fabric.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Beyond recycled ranges, campaigners are asking whether fast fashion can ever be green. \u201cThe big issue I struggle with is that, yes, we can push for brands to become more sustainable, but as long as they\u2019re churning out millions of garments a year, we\u2019re not going to change anything,\u201d says <a href=\"https://tollydollyposhfashion.com/\" title=\"\">Tolmeia Gregory</a>, a 19-year-old sustainable-fashion blogger and environmental activist. She has changed the way she dresses to include more secondhand clothes and sustainable brands, and is spending more on higher quality items that last longer.</p> <p>Legislation may be part of the solution, but the government was accused of complacency last month after rejecting recommendations from MPs to improve fashion\u2019s wider impact on the environment. In its report, Fixing Fashion, published in February, the Environmental Audit Committee said a 1p levy on each garment would raise \u00a335m a year to improve infrastructure for the collection and sorting of clothes that otherwise go to landfill. It proposed a VAT cut on clothing repair and better rewards and penalties. The committee also recommended mandatory environmental targets for bigger retailers.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a spectrum of engagement in the industry, including those paying lip service to this new landscape, and we need regulation to set a level playing field,\u201d says Mary Creagh, the chair of the committee. Creagh compares the forthcoming ban on plastic straws, stirrers and cotton buds with the government\u2019s response to the report. \u201cStraws was EU regulation but [the environment secretary] Michael Gove did a very good job of making it his own for a Brexiter,\u201d she tells me. \u201cThe government likes to talk green but it\u2019s not very good at walking the walk.\u201d In its response, the government said it recognised the importance of tackling fast fashion and said it was already taking action, but it accepted none of the committee\u2019s recommendations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b0662ee5c2364b959756f0f004840ead9a94da16\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0662ee5c2364b959756f0f004840ead9a94da16/316_204_2314_2314/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zips are a challenge for those trying to eliminate virgin plastic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zips are a challenge for those trying to eliminate virgin plastic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ihoe/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the meantime, brands with an eye on the clock are making inroads. Those that rely less on synthetic materials are using new technology to recycle cotton, for example. On the Isle of Wight, Rapanui now offers customers \u00a35 in credit if they return clothing to it for recycling rather than throw it away. Mart Drake-Knight, the co-founder of the company, says it has flourished because it has invested in sustainability. \u201cWe\u2019re not hippies \u2026 we\u2019re doubling in size each year \u2013 the economy has rewarded us for this.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes it\u2019s the little details that pose the biggest challenges for those trying to eliminate virgin plastic. Patagonia tried for years to find a supplier to make its logo labels with recycled plastic. At Everlane, plastic zips and buttons give Smith a headache. \u201cThe next big challenge is elastic,\u201d she adds. \u201cEveryone wants stretch now and that\u2019s all made from virgin petroleum and there isn\u2019t really recycled elastane out there yet.\u201d She is hopeful a solution may yet show itself. Another effect of loudly self-imposing targets is that innovating suppliers hear the cry. \u201cThere are more and more people doing really cool things we didn\u2019t even know about,\u201d she adds. \u201cThe more people doing it and the more influence we have the better so we can make change together.\u201d</p>",

Companies are waking up to this future with varying degrees of commitment. Stella McCartney wants to phase out virgin nylon by 2020 and polyester by 2025. In the mass market, Adidas has committed to using recycled polyester in all viable applications by 2024. Meanwhile, brands such as Asos and Boohoo, which are synonymous with the excesses of fast fashion, have set out their stalls \u2013 or, at least, stalls within their stores. Asos has grown its Eco Edit since its launch in 2010. To qualify, clothing must contain at least 50% \u201csustainable\u201d fibres, including recycled plastics. Last month, Boohoo launched For the Future, the brand\u2019s first recycled range (\u201cDress well and do your bit for the planet? We\u2019re totally here for it.\u201d). But is there not a risk of greenwashing when brands whose business models rely on cheap fashion position themselves as environmental crusaders? \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make a big statement and put it out there,\u201d says Smith at Everlane. \u201cSaying, \u2018We\u2019re going to start a little baby eco line,\u2019 is better than nothing but by setting a real target and telling everyone about it, you\u2019re like: \u2018OK, now we\u2019ve really got to do it.\u2019\u201d On Boohoo\u2019s homepage at the time of writing, the link to the recycled range, which includes a T-shirt for \u00a35.40, comes some distance below a \u201c50% off absolutely everything\u201d banner, a link to the summer and swimwear range with the slogan \u201ccatch flights not feelings\u201d and right next to a link to non-recycled plastic swimsuits on sale for \u00a35. There is nothing on Asos\u2019s homepage to indicate it has an \u201ceco\u201d range (now called the Responsible Edit) \u2013 I have to click through to find it. Boohoo says its new range was more prominent on its site at launch and that it is only \u201cthe latest in a line of initiatives designed to make it easier for our customers to do the right thing\u201d. Asos says it promotes its ethical range through several channels beyond its homepage and has added \u201cresponsible\u201d filters to all its ranges rather than confining the clothes to one page. Beyond recycled ranges, campaigners are asking whether fast fashion can ever be green. \u201cThe big issue I struggle with is that, yes, we can push for brands to become more sustainable, but as long as they\u2019re churning out millions of garments a year, we\u2019re not going to change anything,\u201d says Tolmeia Gregory, a 19-year-old sustainable-fashion blogger and environmental activist. She has changed the way she dresses to include more secondhand clothes and sustainable brands, and is spending more on higher quality items that last longer. Legislation may be part of the solution, but the government was accused of complacency last month after rejecting recommendations from MPs to improve fashion\u2019s wider impact on the environment. In its report, Fixing Fashion, published in February, the Environmental Audit Committee said a 1p levy on each garment would raise \u00a335m a year to improve infrastructure for the collection and sorting of clothes that otherwise go to landfill. It proposed a VAT cut on clothing repair and better rewards and penalties. The committee also recommended mandatory environmental targets for bigger retailers. \u201cThere\u2019s a spectrum of engagement in the industry, including those paying lip service to this new landscape, and we need regulation to set a level playing field,\u201d says Mary Creagh, the chair of the committee. Creagh compares the forthcoming ban on plastic straws, stirrers and cotton buds with the government\u2019s response to the report. \u201cStraws was EU regulation but [the environment secretary] Michael Gove did a very good job of making it his own for a Brexiter,\u201d she tells me. \u201cThe government likes to talk green but it\u2019s not very good at walking the walk.\u201d In its response, the government said it recognised the importance of tackling fast fashion and said it was already taking action, but it accepted none of the committee\u2019s recommendations. In the meantime, brands with an eye on the clock are making inroads. Those that rely less on synthetic materials are using new technology to recycle cotton, for example. On the Isle of Wight, Rapanui now offers customers \u00a35 in credit if they return clothing to it for recycling rather than throw it away. Mart Drake-Knight, the co-founder of the company, says it has flourished because it has invested in sustainability. \u201cWe\u2019re not hippies \u2026 we\u2019re doubling in size each year \u2013 the economy has rewarded us for this.\u201d Sometimes it\u2019s the little details that pose the biggest challenges for those trying to eliminate virgin plastic. Patagonia tried for years to find a supplier to make its logo labels with recycled plastic. At Everlane, plastic zips and buttons give Smith a headache. \u201cThe next big challenge is elastic,\u201d she adds. \u201cEveryone wants stretch now and that\u2019s all made from virgin petroleum and there isn\u2019t really recycled elastane out there yet.\u201d She is hopeful a solution may yet show itself. Another effect of loudly self-imposing targets is that innovating suppliers hear the cry. \u201cThere are more and more people doing really cool things we didn\u2019t even know about,\u201d she adds. \u201cThe more people doing it and the more influence we have the better so we can make change together.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The lobbying firm co-run by the man heading Boris Johnson\u2019s leadership campaign has been writing to councils on behalf of a tobacco company before the announcement of planned new anti-smoking measures due in the coming weeks. The Guardian has seen emails showing Crosby Textor Fullbrook Partners (CTFP) contacted councillors on behalf of Philip Morris, seeking to get the tobacco multinational involved in voluntary moves to curb cigarette smoking, as opposed to more onerous statutory efforts. One of CTFP\u2019s partners, Mark Fullbrook, has taken temporary leave from the firm to act as Johnson\u2019s campaign manager. The lobbying efforts took place in April, while Fullbrook was still with the company. While there is no suggestion that Fullbrook was personally involved in these actions, or that he is advising Johnson to adopt a similar line, it comes just over a week after Johnson called for a reconsideration of \u201csin taxes\u201d on highly sugared drinks. It later emerged that another arm of Crosby\u2019s lobbying group represents a dairy firm in Australia which sells high-sugar milk drinks of the sort that could be targeted by an extension to a UK sugar tax. CTFP states that Fullbrook\u2019s role at the company has no bearing on his work with Johnson, and that he currently has no contact with clients. But amid continued delays to a landmark government consultation on public health, expected to include tough new anti-smoking measures, campaign groups and Labour have urged the Johnson camp to commit to not watering down anti-smoking plans if he becomes prime minister. They have also called on the health secretary, Matt Hancock, now a leading supporter of Johnson, to push ahead with the plans, which are expected to include a \u201cpolluter pays\u201d levy in which tobacco firms would be forced to finance anti-smoking measures, and compulsory cards inside cigarette packets detailing the health perils. The so-called prevention green paper, originally due in the first half of 2019, was scheduled to be released this week, but the Department for Health and Social Care says it does not have a confirmed publication date. While CTFP does not say which firms it lobbies for, one email seen by the Guardian shows one of its lobbyists contacted a councillor on behalf of Philip Morris. The multinational company is best known for the Marlboro brand but is branching out into vaping and e-cigarette products. Philip Morris representatives wanted to meet local public health officials, said the email, \u201cto explain what they are seeking to do and in what ways they can help to reduce smoking rates in local areas\u201d. Another email was sent in 2018 directly by Philip Morris to the chief executive of an English council, also offering help on voluntary measures to help people quit smoking or shift to vaping-type products as part of efforts to reduce the smoking rate to less than 5% of the adult population, a key aim of the prevention green paper. Tobacco firms have been pushing for such voluntary methods, rather than the statutory measures expected in the green paper. While it is understood that Hancock remains keen on the measures, campaigners fear the document is being held up by other ministers, amid wider wrangles about using Theresa May\u2019s last weeks in office to tie the hands of a future government. Bob Blackman, the Conservative MP who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on smoking and health, said he was worried about the green paper being delayed. \u201cWhat we do know is it\u2019s held up, and that\u2019s the concern,\u201d Blackman said. \u201cAnd a hold-up would not be acceptable, given that we want to get on with the job of preventing people from killing themselves.\u201d Deborah Arnott, the chief executive of Action on Smoking and Health (Ash), said the charity was urging Johnson \u201cnot to give in to any pressure to delay the green paper, or to remove the proposal for a charge on tobacco manufacturers to fund government\u2019s anti-smoking measures\u201d. She continued: \u201cThis is popular with the public, including Conservative voters, but it\u2019s not what the tobacco industry wants. \u201cTobacco manufacturers and their lobbyists, like Crosby Textor Fullbrook, are urging cash-strapped local authorities to enter into voluntary partnerships instead, and say they want to support councils\u2019 smoking cessation programmes when in reality it\u2019s about promoting their own products.\u201d Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: \u201cThis is potentially worrying given the links between Boris Johnson\u2019s campaign and corporate lobbyists, especially after Johnson decided to water down restrictions on sugar. \u201cMatt Hancock, who has been working as a cheerleader for Johnson, must immediately reject any changes to the green paper which would weaken the fight against smoking.\u201d CTFP was contacted for comment. Johnson\u2019s campaign declined to comment.",

Even these seats from an abandoned railway? \u201cEspecially these,\u201d he says, smiling.</p> <p>Mahama, a junkyard utopian whose art involves recycling stuff that\u2019s lost its purpose, bought up rows and rows of these seats. He packed them into shipping containers and sent them on a 5,000-mile trip, from his west African homeland to the Whitworth, along with some school cupboards no longer fit for purpose, exercise books of children now grown up, and the minutes of Ghanaian parliamentary debates now deemed obsolete.</p> <p>Then he arranged rows of seats into terraces, ringed the seats with the cupboards, and filled their shelves with the books so that intrigued visitors can thumb through them during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/manchester-international-festival\">Manchester international festival</a>. He\u2019s also used the leather from the first-class seats to bind albums of historic photographs from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ghana\">Ghana</a>\u2019s early independence years. He calls the resulting installation <a href=\"https://www.whitworth.manchester.ac.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/upcomingexhibitions/mifibrahimmahama/\">Parliament of Ghosts</a>.</p> <p>Parliament of Ghosts seems to critique many things \u2013 colonialism, Ghana\u2019s past and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a>, too. \u201cNot everything is about Brexit,\u201d he laughs. \u201cBut sure. It\u2019s about Brexit among other things. Ghana is very connected with Britain even now. So why not Brexit?\u201d</p> <p>Connected is an understatement. From 1867 to 1957, the Gold Coast was a British colony, stitched together from more than 70 ethnic groups each with their own language, plundered for labour as well as minerals and commodities such as gold and cocoa. Even after independence, Britain couldn\u2019t keep its nose out: along with the US, Britain strove to undermine Ghana\u2019s attempt at economic self-sufficiency in its early independent years by putting in place trade barriers and stockpiling cocoa to collapse its price. All of this took place before Mahama was born, but the history resurfaces again and again in his work \u2013 utopias dashed, the labour that went into projects that became obsolete. And yet, for all that, his art is hopeful \u2013 imagining that something good can be snatched from these jaws.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbdae1f870146c026522f9afbeb1ab26ae249444\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbdae1f870146c026522f9afbeb1ab26ae249444/0_289_3600_2159/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ibrahim Mahama\u2019s Parliament of Ghosts\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Recycled school books ...

After posing for photos, Mahama returns to the parliament to find that everyone occupying its seats \u2013 me, his assistant, contractors installing the show \u2013 is not talking but staring gormlessly into our phones, trapped in our filter bubbles. We are the problem; Mahama\u2019s installation, just possibly, the solution.</p> <p>But the revolution Mahama has in mind is an African rather than European one. When Mahama\u2019s Parliament is taken down in September, it will be packed up, returned to Ghana and installed in his home town of Tamale. This spring, Mahama opened the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sccatamale/\">Savannah Centre for Contemporary Art</a> there, providing an artist-run project space, exhibition and research hub, cultural repository and artists\u2019 residency built by his father, a building contractor. He hopes his Parliament of Ghosts will become permanent in Tamale.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m an artist who wants to work in Africa. And I am also tired of producing work that gets exported to Europe and America. I want local people to experience art made in Ghana, as well as to experience what you experience.\u201d</p> <p>Fair enough, but Mahama is currently a hot commodity outside Africa; his image hangs in a huge banner on the outside of the Whitworth. \u201cIt is very strange to appear that way,\u201d he says. He\u2019s represented by the UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.whitecube.com/home\">White Cube</a> and earlier this year became the youngest artist to exhibit in the first Ghanaian pavilion at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/venice-biennale-2019\">Venice Biennale</a>. Soon, he\u2019s heading off to Chicago to collaborate with African-American artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/theaster-gates\">Theaster Gates</a>.</p> <p>Working with others suits him. \u201cI\u2019m not a solitary artist, but part of a community and I have a vision of art that can effect change rather than being about producing beautiful commodities for sale on the market. Perhaps that distinguishes my work \u2013 it departs from the European tradition.\u201d He suggests, too, that being raised in a polygamous family \u2013 he has several mothers and fathers and several hundred siblings \u2013 made him become an artist favouring collaboration. Is he married himself? \u201cNo, not yet and no children either,\u201d he says, waving a hand before this installation as if to suggest that his children are all around us.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2a82395eb4f6df9962b0fdc2265b05dbe8c5f99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2a82395eb4f6df9962b0fdc2265b05dbe8c5f99/0_120_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ibrahim Mahama\u2019s Parliament of Ghosts\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ibrahim Mahama\u2019s Parliament of Ghosts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Pollard</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cEverything here bears the residue of history,\u201d says Mahama. \u201cMy interest comes from the workers who made these seats and the people who used these trains to get to work. Their labour haunts the seats.\u201d </p> <p>Many of the things that Mahama gleefully collects from scrap dealers, school teachers and railway managers carry the sweat, grease, smells and even hopes of the past. As we chat, though, a cleaner sprays and wipes the seats around us. Isn\u2019t she erasing history?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a health and safety question,\u201d says Mahama. \u201cThe dust needs to be removed. But otherwise the residue is there.\u201d I ask if he\u2019s heard of object oriented ontology, the transhuman philosophy that rejects the privileging of human existence over the existence of nonhuman objects and urges us to have have solidarity with non-humans \u2013 not just with charismatic megafauna such as lions, but algae, cutlery, rocks. \u201cI haven\u2019t but it sounds worth thinking about.\u201d The parliamentarians are not just the humans who will sit in these seats, but also the distressed old things that make up the installation. As curator Dominique Heyse-Moore puts it, \u201cin their fatigued state they speak, too. They have journeyed across continents and around Ghana, witnesses to innumerable lives, and now to us here in Manchester.\u201d</p> <p>It is as though he\u2019s uprooted the colonial infrastructure and returned it to the land of the oppressors. Like the locomotives and carriages from which Mahama salvaged them, these seats were probably made in Manchester or Leeds. </p> <p>The Parliament of Ghosts echoes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/mar/18/mike-nelson-interview-tate-britain-asset-strippers-cement-mixer\">Mike Nelson\u2019s The Asset Strippers</a>, currently on show at Tate Britain, which consists of objects from the postwar Britain that framed his childhood \u2013 enormous knitting machines, woodwork stripped from a former army barracks, graffitied steel awnings and doors from an NHS hospital. Mahama\u2019s installation has a similar nostalgia, though in his case it is a nostalgia for a time before he was born. Now 32, Mahama is too young to have witnessed the heady early days of days of Ghanaian independence, when the country\u2019s first president Kwame Nkrumah sought to make his proud, independent nation economically self-supporting. Following a coup in 1966, the ruins of that great national dream remained littered around Ghana, as the nation struggled under military rule and globalised neoliberal economic orthodoxy.</p> <p>\u201cAll around Ghana, you will see tall silos built in modernist style from concrete in the late 1950s by the Cocoa Processing Company to store cocoa. They were symbols of the new Ghana\u2019s self-determination.\u201d</p> <p>Today these examples of so-called \u201cfreedom architecture\u201d lie derelict, still dominating towns and villages, but sad monuments to crushed features. No wonder Mahama is intrigued by them, photographing them and building replicas that figure in his exhibition. As with the abandoned rolling stock of Ghana Railways, these silos speak of failure and ruin. Is his art melancholic? \u201cYes, but at the same time the silos contain vast potential. That is the dialectic in my art \u2013 they contain potential and yet are in a state of collapse. For me, as an artist, hope and failure have a common premise.\u201d</p> <p>As we stroll around the exhibition, a voice narrates parliamentary speeches from the 1960s. You don\u2019t have to be Ghanaian to get caught up in these speeches\u2019 heady dreams for building a new nation free from British rule. </p> <p>Mahama is best known for his work draping buildings in patchwork quilts of old jute sacks, as if he were a Ghanaian equivalent to the celebrated wrap artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/christo\">Christo</a>. But, really, there is more going on. \u201cI used jute sacks because for me the history of crisis and failure is absorbed into the material. Their history speaks of how global transactions and capitalist structures work. And because how their humbleness contrasts with the monumentality of the buildings they cover.\u201d Recently he used the sacks to replace the flags outside the Rockefeller Center in New York \u2013 a reminder, he suggests, of \u201cthe history of labour and trade underlying our global condition\u201d.</p> <p>Jute sacks are ubiquitous in Ghana. Made in south-east Asia, they are imported to transport cocoa beans but then get repurposed to transport food, charcoal and other commodities. \u201cThey even become money, used to buy other commodities,\u201d Mahama says. He takes part in this unofficial economy by exchanging new sacks for old in order to get hold of the historical residues in the fabric of the sacks. \u201cPeople think I am very odd,\u201d he says with a laugh.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"632b4f478aa7bc86d2e47d7ba1ade4fd7fa01211\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/632b4f478aa7bc86d2e47d7ba1ade4fd7fa01211/0_282_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ibrahim Mahama\u2019s Parliament of Ghosts\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Giddy colours ... Ibrahim Mahama\u2019s Parliament of Ghosts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Pollard</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I tell Mahama he reminds me of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/walter-benjamin\">Walter Benjamin</a>, the Jewish German philosopher who collected worthless, trashy consumer goods that seemed to promise utopia but became obsolete. \u201cYes, he means a lot to me. As do all those great Marxist thinkers I studied \u2013 Benjamin, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Ranci%C3%A8re\">Ranci\u00e8re</a>, Marx himself.\u201d</p> <p>After acquiring these old sacks, he and a huge team of collaborators painstakingly sew them together into quilts as much as 70 metres wide. One critic compared this work to the process of holding together the patchwork nation of many ethnicities in the postcolonial era. For Mahama\u2019s 2015 project Exchange Exchanger, he draped multiple buildings: the abandoned Food Distribution Corporation building in Accra; Ghana\u2019s national theatre; a six-storey building that was going to be a bank but has lain abandoned for a decade; a squatted, half-finished apartment block. \u201cMy hope is that a father will be walking with his son one evening and talk about what they see.\u201d</p> <p>During this extraordinarily laborious collaborative project, Mahama found himself explaining what he was up to with a baffled cane-maker in an Accra market. It was then he had an epiphany. \u201cHe told me the story he heard as a child of a magician who wrapped a stick with a large piece of paper. And then he asked what the object was. Stick? Paper? Both? Neither? Nobody could get it quite right because, the magician said, the object had a completely different life because of the fragments collected from both stick and paper. This was a revelation to me because it made me think of time in my work \u2013 how it extends forwards and backwards. The objects I use in my work carry the past and the future, too.\u201d</p> <p>In the third and final room, we time travel to Mahama\u2019s past to look at two paintings he made as a student at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in the early years of this decade and resolved never to show. They are composed from industrially printed textiles. Some were made nearby at the ABC Wax Factory outside Manchester. But not all: others were handmade in northern Ghana.</p> <p>Why did he change his mind about showing these paintings in public? \u201cI think, after the Parliament and all the archive material, this room is a very powerful contrast.\u201d It is, too: the giddy colours are a delight. But, as so often with Mahama\u2019s work, there\u2019s more to it than aesthetics. He exchanged these textiles with women who worked sewing his jute sacks, some of which had been used as clothes, baby carriers and bags before being repurposed as art.</p> <p>Mahama tells me that these clothes are passed down the generations and that to wash them is to break the chain of familiarity to a family. Fashion designer Stella McCartney recently told the Observer that clothes should never be washed, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/jul/07/stella-mccartney-its-not-like-i-am-here-for-an-easy-life\">the dirt brushed off</a>. Mahama has a similar thought, though he would baulk at brushing the dirt of the past from the found objects he uses in his art. \u201cThey bear our hopes for the future. So we must treat them with care.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Parliament of Ghosts is at <a href=\"https://www.whitworth.manchester.ac.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/upcomingexhibitions/mifibrahimmahama/\">the Whitworth, Manchester</a>, until 29 September.</p>",

They have journeyed across continents and around Ghana, witnesses to innumerable lives, and now to us here in Manchester.\u201d It is as though he\u2019s uprooted the colonial infrastructure and returned it to the land of the oppressors. Like the locomotives and carriages from which Mahama salvaged them, these seats were probably made in Manchester or Leeds. The Parliament of Ghosts echoes Mike Nelson\u2019s The Asset Strippers, currently on show at Tate Britain, which consists of objects from the postwar Britain that framed his childhood \u2013 enormous knitting machines, woodwork stripped from a former army barracks, graffitied steel awnings and doors from an NHS hospital. Mahama\u2019s installation has a similar nostalgia, though in his case it is a nostalgia for a time before he was born. Now 32, Mahama is too young to have witnessed the heady early days of days of Ghanaian independence, when the country\u2019s first president Kwame Nkrumah sought to make his proud, independent nation economically self-supporting. Following a coup in 1966, the ruins of that great national dream remained littered around Ghana, as the nation struggled under military rule and globalised neoliberal economic orthodoxy. \u201cAll around Ghana, you will see tall silos built in modernist style from concrete in the late 1950s by the Cocoa Processing Company to store cocoa. They were symbols of the new Ghana\u2019s self-determination.\u201d Today these examples of so-called \u201cfreedom architecture\u201d lie derelict, still dominating towns and villages, but sad monuments to crushed features. No wonder Mahama is intrigued by them, photographing them and building replicas that figure in his exhibition. As with the abandoned rolling stock of Ghana Railways, these silos speak of failure and ruin. Is his art melancholic? \u201cYes, but at the same time the silos contain vast potential. That is the dialectic in my art \u2013 they contain potential and yet are in a state of collapse. For me, as an artist, hope and failure have a common premise.\u201d As we stroll around the exhibition, a voice narrates parliamentary speeches from the 1960s. You don\u2019t have to be Ghanaian to get caught up in these speeches\u2019 heady dreams for building a new nation free from British rule. Mahama is best known for his work draping buildings in patchwork quilts of old jute sacks, as if he were a Ghanaian equivalent to the celebrated wrap artist Christo. But, really, there is more going on. \u201cI used jute sacks because for me the history of crisis and failure is absorbed into the material. Their history speaks of how global transactions and capitalist structures work. And because how their humbleness contrasts with the monumentality of the buildings they cover.\u201d Recently he used the sacks to replace the flags outside the Rockefeller Center in New York \u2013 a reminder, he suggests, of \u201cthe history of labour and trade underlying our global condition\u201d. Jute sacks are ubiquitous in Ghana. Made in south-east Asia, they are imported to transport cocoa beans but then get repurposed to transport food, charcoal and other commodities. \u201cThey even become money, used to buy other commodities,\u201d Mahama says. He takes part in this unofficial economy by exchanging new sacks for old in order to get hold of the historical residues in the fabric of the sacks. \u201cPeople think I am very odd,\u201d he says with a laugh. I tell Mahama he reminds me of Walter Benjamin, the Jewish German philosopher who collected worthless, trashy consumer goods that seemed to promise utopia but became obsolete. \u201cYes, he means a lot to me. As do all those great Marxist thinkers I studied \u2013 Benjamin, Ranci\u00e8re, Marx himself.\u201d After acquiring these old sacks, he and a huge team of collaborators painstakingly sew them together into quilts as much as 70 metres wide. One critic compared this work to the process of holding together the patchwork nation of many ethnicities in the postcolonial era. For Mahama\u2019s 2015 project Exchange Exchanger, he draped multiple buildings: the abandoned Food Distribution Corporation building in Accra; Ghana\u2019s national theatre; a six-storey building that was going to be a bank but has lain abandoned for a decade; a squatted, half-finished apartment block. \u201cMy hope is that a father will be walking with his son one evening and talk about what they see.\u201d During this extraordinarily laborious collaborative project, Mahama found himself explaining what he was up to with a baffled cane-maker in an Accra market. It was then he had an epiphany. \u201cHe told me the story he heard as a child of a magician who wrapped a stick with a large piece of paper. And then he asked what the object was. Stick? Paper? Both? Neither? Nobody could get it quite right because, the magician said, the object had a completely different life because of the fragments collected from both stick and paper. This was a revelation to me because it made me think of time in my work \u2013 how it extends forwards and backwards. The objects I use in my work carry the past and the future, too.\u201d In the third and final room, we time travel to Mahama\u2019s past to look at two paintings he made as a student at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in the early years of this decade and resolved never to show. They are composed from industrially printed textiles. Some were made nearby at the ABC Wax Factory outside Manchester. But not all: others were handmade in northern Ghana. Why did he change his mind about showing these paintings in public? \u201cI think, after the Parliament and all the archive material, this room is a very powerful contrast.\u201d It is, too: the giddy colours are a delight. But, as so often with Mahama\u2019s work, there\u2019s more to it than aesthetics. He exchanged these textiles with women who worked sewing his jute sacks, some of which had been used as clothes, baby carriers and bags before being repurposed as art. Mahama tells me that these clothes are passed down the generations and that to wash them is to break the chain of familiarity to a family. Fashion designer Stella McCartney recently told the Observer that clothes should never be washed, but the dirt brushed off. Mahama has a similar thought, though he would baulk at brushing the dirt of the past from the found objects he uses in his art. \u201cThey bear our hopes for the future. So we must treat them with care.\u201d \u2022 Parliament of Ghosts is at the Whitworth, Manchester, until 29 September.",

It said the UK\u2019s food and farming system must be radically transformed and become sustainable within 10 years.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.thersa.org/ffcc\">commission\u2019s report</a>, which was welcomed by the environment secretary, Michael Gove, concluded that farmers must be enabled to shift from intensive farming to more organic and wildlife friendly production, raising livestock on grass and growing more nuts and pulses. It also said a National Nature Service should be created to give opportunities for young people to work in the countryside and, for example, tackle the climate crisis by planting trees or restoring peatlands.</p> <p>\u201cOur own health and the health of the land are inextricably intertwined [but] in the last 70 years, this relationship has been broken,\u201d said the report, which was produced by leaders from farming, supermarket and food supply businesses, as well as health and environment groups, and involved conversations with thousands of rural inhabitants.</p> <p>\u201cTime is now running out. The actions that we take in the next 10 years are critical: to recover and regenerate nature and to restore health and wellbeing to both people and planet,\u201d said the commission, which was convened by the <a href=\"https://www.thersa.org/\">RSA</a>, a group focused on pressing social challenges.</p> <p>The commission said most farmers thought they could make big changes in five to 10 years if they got the right backing.</p> <p>\u201cFarmers are extraordinarily adaptable,\u201d said Sue Pritchard, director of the RSA commission and an organic farmer in Wales. \u201cWe have to live with change every single day of our lives.</p> <p>\u201cWe are really keen that farmers feel they are in the driving seat and that they can be a force of change.

      "bodyText": "The true cost of cheap, unhealthy food is a spiralling public health crisis and environmental destruction, according to a high-level commission. It said the UK\u2019s food and farming system must be radically transformed and become sustainable within 10 years. The commission\u2019s report, which was welcomed by the environment secretary, Michael Gove, concluded that farmers must be enabled to shift from intensive farming to more organic and wildlife friendly production, raising livestock on grass and growing more nuts and pulses. It also said a National Nature Service should be created to give opportunities for young people to work in the countryside and, for example, tackle the climate crisis by planting trees or restoring peatlands. \u201cOur own health and the health of the land are inextricably intertwined [but] in the last 70 years, this relationship has been broken,\u201d said the report, which was produced by leaders from farming, supermarket and food supply businesses, as well as health and environment groups, and involved conversations with thousands of rural inhabitants. \u201cTime is now running out. The actions that we take in the next 10 years are critical: to recover and regenerate nature and to restore health and wellbeing to both people and planet,\u201d said the commission, which was convened by the RSA, a group focused on pressing social challenges. The commission said most farmers thought they could make big changes in five to 10 years if they got the right backing. \u201cFarmers are extraordinarily adaptable,\u201d said Sue Pritchard, director of the RSA commission and an organic farmer in Wales. \u201cWe have to live with change every single day of our lives. \u201cWe are really keen that farmers feel they are in the driving seat and that they can be a force of change. At the moment, a lot of farmers feel beleaguered and that they have become the bad guys. But without sustainable, secure and safe farming in the UK, we will not survive.\u201d The commission criticised decades of government policy aimed at making food cheaper, fuelling rising obesity and other health problems. \u201cThe true cost of that is simply passed off elsewhere in society \u2013 in a degraded environment, spiralling ill health and impoverished high streets,\u201d said the report. Pritchard said the UK had the third cheapest basket of food in the developed world, but also had the highest food poverty in Europe in terms of people being able to afford a healthy diet. Type 2 diabetes, a diet-related illness, costs the UK \u00a327bn a year, she said. The commission also said agriculture produced more than 10% of the UK\u2019s climate-heating gases and was the biggest destroyer of wildlife; the abundance of key species has fallen 67% since 1970 and 13% of species are now close to extinction. To solve these crises, the commission said \u201cagroecology\u201d practices must be supported \u2013 such as organic farming and agroforestry, where trees are combined with crops and livestock such as pigs or egg-laying hens. The commission has also adapted for the UK a recently published scientific diet that is both nutritious and environmentally sustainable. While it and other studies recommend large reductions in meat-eating, Pritchard said: \u201cThere is a strong case to be made [in the UK] to support sustainable beef and lamb in the places where grass is the best thing to grow.\u201d The so-called planetary health diet calls for more nuts and pulses in diets and Pritchard said these and more vegetables could be grown in the UK. Hazelnuts and walnuts are native to the UK, she pointed out, and some farmers are now starting to grow crops like lentils and quinoa, as well as beans and peas. The commission said the government must develop a plan to put the countryside and the communities living there at the centre of the green economy. \u201c[Brexit] creates a once-in-50-years opportunity to change our food and farming system, but we need to act now: the climate emergency makes urgent, radical action on the environment essential,\u201d said Sir Ian Cheshire, chair of the RSA commission and also a senior government adviser. Gove said: \u201cThis report raises issues that are hugely important. We know that it is in the interests of farmers and landowners to move to a more sustainable model.\u201d He added that the government\u2019s agriculture bill would reward farmers with public money for public goods and a new \u201cfarm to fork\u201d food review would look to ensure everyone had access to healthy British food.

The Green MP Caroline Lucas said: \u201cThis monumental report is a powerful and profound account of the ecological transformation of our food and farming system that we urgently need \u2013 and where we can start.\u201d The commission said a new non-profit bank should be set up to provide finance to farmers investing in new practices. With Brexit uncertainty worrying farmers, the commission urged minister to stop delays on policy and trade decisions and commit to a future-proof ambition by January 2020. It also said schools, hospitals and prisons should buy more sustainably produced British food. Prof Joanna Price, the vice-chancellor of the Royal Agricultural University, said: \u201cThe report paints an honest picture of the challenges and sets out some bold ideas to address them.

      "bodyText": "Tom Steyer entered the Democratic primary with a singular advantage: the largest fortune of any 2020 candidate. It could also be his biggest liability. Reflecting on the ethics of a billionaire candidate at a time when growing inequality is a key election issue, the former hedge fund manager and Democratic party mega-donor offered up an unusual defense: Queen Bey. \u201cShould we put a limit on what Beyonc\u00e9 makes? I don\u2019t see why,\u201d Steyer told the Guardian by phone. \u201cI don\u2019t think in the United States of America, we should put a ceiling on how far people can go.\u201d Steyer transitioned to a critique of communism and the argument that \u201cat the heart of every great fortune is a crime\u201d: \u201cWhat Karl Marx failed to take into consideration was software \u2013 that if you are Michael Jackson or Rihanna or Beyonc\u00e9 or anyone producing an idea, with software you aren\u2019t just the best singer in your village \u2026 you have an ability to reproduce that song infinitely at very low cost around the world.\u201d Steyer announced his surprise campaign last week, six months after he publicly declared he would not be running. The 62-year-old Californian is now tasked with distinguishing himself from the other white men with no widespread name recognition in the 2020 field, convincing voters that he has long been using his money for good \u2013 and that the best way for him to help save the planet is from the Oval Office. A longtime San Francisco resident and father of four, Steyer founded the hedge fund Farallon Capital Management in 1986 and left in 2012. Worth an estimated $1.6bn, he has spent his money advocating for clean-air and clean energy laws, opposing corporate tax loopholes, taking on tobacco companies, registering youth voters and other liberal causes. Over the past year, he got attention traveling the country with his group Need to Impeach, which garnered more than 8 million supporters who want to oust Trump from office. The impeachment advocacy has earned him a Twitter insult from the president (\u201cWacky &amp; totally unhinged\u201d) as well as shade from some fellow Democrats. Steyer\u2019s other not-for-profit group, NextGen America, has spent millions rallying people around the climate crisis and registering voters. Steyer has pledged to spend $100m on his 2020 bid \u2013 more than the combined fundraising of the five highest-polling Democrats in the last three months. The billionaire almost immediately faced backlash and skepticism from progressive activists, some begging him to spend the money on something else, such as down-ballot races and voter registration. \u201cDemocrats are expressing frustration that he is going this route rather than putting $100m into trying to flip the Senate,\u201d said RL Miller, the chair of the California Democratic party\u2019s environmental caucus, adding that her immediate reaction to Steyer 2020 was \u201ceye-roll emoji\u201d. The US senator Elizabeth Warren has already solidified herself as the leading 2020 contender calling for impeachment while the Washington governor, Jay Inslee, has become the definitive climate crisis candidate, Miller said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure what [Steyer] can add? The \u2018business man with no prior elected experience\u2019 lane?\u201d In an interview on his way to the airport after a campaign stop in South Carolina, Steyer explained why he decided to run after declaring in January that he would spend \u201c100%\u201d of his \u201ctime and effort\u201d in 2019 on impeachment. \u201cPart of it was watching that failure of government and just being so frustrated,\u201d he said. \u201cLiterally, watching the debates and watching this campaign evolve, I thought, \u2018Wow, I can\u2019t sleep.\u2019\u201d On impeachment, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ve won the argument but we haven\u2019t won the fight.\u201d Steyer\u2019s bid has drawn comparisons to billionaire ex-Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, whose flirtation with a White House run was derided as a wasteful vanity project.

      "body": "<p>The scene, Cardiff. The date, 16 June 1998. The European summit of heads of state and government has just ended, rounding off the UK\u2019s six-month EU presidency. Tony Blair, who has chaired the summit, is holding a press conference. The EU correspondent for the Daily Telegraph puts up his hand and launches into a tirade that is not so much question as full-blown editorial. Blair, a product of the same <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/15/oxford-union-president-boris-johnson-neil-sherlock\" title=\"\">public-school system</a> as the questioner, quips: \u201cBoris, you should be prime minister!\u201d Twenty-one years on, this prophecy looks likely to come true.</p> <p>In Brussels, officials who remember <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/14/boris-johnson-brussels-bashing-stories-shaped-politics\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson from his days there</a> (from 1989 to 1994) are dumbfounded. Known to this day as a \u201cbuffoon\u201d, he is the source of many painful memories. The son of a former Eurocrat and member of the European parliament, he made a lasting impression as the inventor of the \u201cEuromyth\u201d, a journalistic genre now termed fake news. With the backing of his editors it seems, he eagerly misrepresented events or even completely made up stories to portray the European commission as a bureaucratic monster making absurd proposals. As he once explained to me, aged 28 and dressed as ever in a rumpled jacket, his shirt spilling out in typically English manner: \u201cYou mustn\u2019t let facts get in the way of a good story.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-lies-conservative-leader-candidate-list-times-banana-brexit-bus-a8929076.html\" title=\"\">Among other yarns</a>, he claimed there were plans to establish a \u201cbanana police force\u201d to check the fruit was the right shape, that coffins would be standardised and prawn cocktail crisps would be outlawed. He was quick to highlight the purportedly extravagant lifestyle of overpaid, tax-exempted Eurocrats.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How can you counter someone who has no illusions about a profession he only practises to gain leverage?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For many on the continent, Johnson was then, and remains, the epitome of what is worst in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/25/britain-ruled-private-educated-people-culture-deference\" title=\"\">English (not British) elite:</a> public school, Oxbridge, arrogant, cynical, mildly xenophobic and quite certain of their cultural superiority. On this last point \u2013 wholly at odds with the popular image Johnson seeks to promote \u2013 he came across as extremely sharp and well-read, and was the envy of many of his European colleagues. A Spanish journalist has a memory of him on a plane reading a book in ancient Greek. In the days when French was the only language authorised in the EU press operation, Johnson once asked a question in Latin. He wanted to know more about some directive supposedly intended to enforce the use of the Latin names of fish to facilitate the common fisheries policy. When Johnson was at a press conference there was never a dull moment.</p> <p>In human terms, he made no secret of being a dilettante, a comradely guy, who enjoyed life and was always ready to lend a hand. Above all, he was perpetually on the lookout for a good story. In a booming voice he would repeatedly ask me: \u201cWhat\u2019s the story today, Jean?\u201d You had to pick your words carefully, or run the risk of the Telegraph printing some daft, uncorroborated tale.</p> <p>Yet he seemed completely guileless, never the hardline ideologue depicting the EU as a remake of the thousand-year Reich and the root of all evil. On the contrary: put simply, here was a man of little principle, amused by everything and not remotely bothered about the consequences of what he wrote or the damage he might be doing. Blessed with a great sense of humour he had no difficulty silencing even the most outspoken critics.</p> <p>After all, how can you counter someone who owns up to his fibs and has no illusions about a profession he only practises to gain leverage? In this respect he was utterly successful. He managed to bring about a permanent shift in the British media, not just the conservative press, eager to copy his success with his Euromyths, a form of journalism that eventually paved the way for Brexit. I remember a Times correspondent \u2013 a paper that sacked Johnson early on in his career for making up a quote \u2013 on the verge of tears as he explained that his copy had been completely rehashed in London to match the growing Eurosceptic mood there. Of course the truth about the EU\u2019s activities was always less spectacular, but not so likely to make the front page.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/15/boris-johnson-inherit-crisis-eu-bashing\">Boris Johnson is about to inherit a crisis his EU-bashing helped spawn | Sonia Purnell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That this spoilt child of a man \u2013 who lies like a toddler and has only the vaguest of political convictions \u2013 should be closing in on power gives the UK\u2019s partners overseas the impression that the end is nigh.

      "bodyText": "The scene, Cardiff. The date, 16 June 1998. The European summit of heads of state and government has just ended, rounding off the UK\u2019s six-month EU presidency. Tony Blair, who has chaired the summit, is holding a press conference. The EU correspondent for the Daily Telegraph puts up his hand and launches into a tirade that is not so much question as full-blown editorial. Blair, a product of the same public-school system as the questioner, quips: \u201cBoris, you should be prime minister!\u201d Twenty-one years on, this prophecy looks likely to come true. In Brussels, officials who remember Boris Johnson from his days there (from 1989 to 1994) are dumbfounded. Known to this day as a \u201cbuffoon\u201d, he is the source of many painful memories. The son of a former Eurocrat and member of the European parliament, he made a lasting impression as the inventor of the \u201cEuromyth\u201d, a journalistic genre now termed fake news. With the backing of his editors it seems, he eagerly misrepresented events or even completely made up stories to portray the European commission as a bureaucratic monster making absurd proposals. As he once explained to me, aged 28 and dressed as ever in a rumpled jacket, his shirt spilling out in typically English manner: \u201cYou mustn\u2019t let facts get in the way of a good story.\u201d Among other yarns, he claimed there were plans to establish a \u201cbanana police force\u201d to check the fruit was the right shape, that coffins would be standardised and prawn cocktail crisps would be outlawed. He was quick to highlight the purportedly extravagant lifestyle of overpaid, tax-exempted Eurocrats. For many on the continent, Johnson was then, and remains, the epitome of what is worst in the English (not British) elite: public school, Oxbridge, arrogant, cynical, mildly xenophobic and quite certain of their cultural superiority. On this last point \u2013 wholly at odds with the popular image Johnson seeks to promote \u2013 he came across as extremely sharp and well-read, and was the envy of many of his European colleagues. A Spanish journalist has a memory of him on a plane reading a book in ancient Greek. In the days when French was the only language authorised in the EU press operation, Johnson once asked a question in Latin. He wanted to know more about some directive supposedly intended to enforce the use of the Latin names of fish to facilitate the common fisheries policy. When Johnson was at a press conference there was never a dull moment. In human terms, he made no secret of being a dilettante, a comradely guy, who enjoyed life and was always ready to lend a hand. Above all, he was perpetually on the lookout for a good story. In a booming voice he would repeatedly ask me: \u201cWhat\u2019s the story today, Jean?\u201d You had to pick your words carefully, or run the risk of the Telegraph printing some daft, uncorroborated tale. Yet he seemed completely guileless, never the hardline ideologue depicting the EU as a remake of the thousand-year Reich and the root of all evil. On the contrary: put simply, here was a man of little principle, amused by everything and not remotely bothered about the consequences of what he wrote or the damage he might be doing. Blessed with a great sense of humour he had no difficulty silencing even the most outspoken critics. After all, how can you counter someone who owns up to his fibs and has no illusions about a profession he only practises to gain leverage? In this respect he was utterly successful. He managed to bring about a permanent shift in the British media, not just the conservative press, eager to copy his success with his Euromyths, a form of journalism that eventually paved the way for Brexit. I remember a Times correspondent \u2013 a paper that sacked Johnson early on in his career for making up a quote \u2013 on the verge of tears as he explained that his copy had been completely rehashed in London to match the growing Eurosceptic mood there. Of course the truth about the EU\u2019s activities was always less spectacular, but not so likely to make the front page. That this spoilt child of a man \u2013 who lies like a toddler and has only the vaguest of political convictions \u2013 should be closing in on power gives the UK\u2019s partners overseas the impression that the end is nigh. This, it seems, will be the final act of a political drama launched by Johnson\u2019s fellow old Etonian David Cameron when he chose to organise a referendum on British membership of the EU. The inability to implement the resulting leave vote and actually leave has made the UK an international laughing stock. Ultimately Johnson is the epitome of the British ruling class, who in their quest for power are happy to gamble cynically with the future of their country and the livelihoods of their fellow citizens. But his lack of any real direction or belief may yet prove an asset, because he is completely unpredictable. Many in Brussels believe he is capable of any move, even backtracking and shelving Brexit if he thinks it could be turned to his personal advantage. After all, before becoming one of the leading lights in the leave campaign, he was for a long time against the idea of the UK leaving the EU. A pragmatic buffoon, in other words, might be better than a fanatic. Watch out though: Johnson is also capable of taking Britain over the cliff. It would be totally at odds with the statesmanship of his political idol, Winston Churchill, but Boris Johnson might think it amusing. \u2022 Jean Quatremer is Brussels correspondent of Lib\u00e9ration",

      "body": "<p>In less than 48 hours in May, Romania\u2019s ruling party was given a triple dose of reality when it was badly beaten in European parliamentary elections, rebuked in a referendum on its attempt to reverse tough anti-corruption laws and had its powerful party leader, Liviu Dragnea, jailed for three-and-a-half years for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/leader-of-romanias-ruling-party-sentenced-for-corruption\">abuse of office</a>.</p> <p>It was a stinging reproach for the Social Democratic party (PSD), after two and a half years of what many considered government-led attacks on the rule of law that caused the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/11/hundreds-injured-in-romania-protests-as-emigrants-return-to-fight-corruption\">largest protests in the country</a> since the fall of communism and led to the president, Klaus Iohannis,<strong> </strong>calling the public vote on what critics said were ruling party efforts to make it more difficult to combat rampant state corruption.</p> <p>More than 80% backed a ban on the government having powers to change judicial legislation by emergency decree and the use of pardons in corruption-related cases, as the PSD\u2019s vote share simultaneously more than halved from the 45% it won in the 2016 general election.</p> <p>Sitting in a plush meeting room in the main government building in Bucharest, Viorica D\u0103ncil\u0103, the Romanian prime minister, is blunt about the beating her party took. \u201cI consider these elections not as a victory of the opposition parties but as a defeat for the PSD,\u201d she said. However, she believes her party can turn things around.</p> <p>In the aftermath of the May votes, D\u0103ncil\u0103 vowed to abandon the controversial judicial proposals, a pledge she reiterated this week. \u201cWe have understood the message from 26 May. We have not spoken about the justice system, we have not let anybody get involved on that topic \u2026 I would like to go back to the agenda that is focused on the citizen, less on the justice system,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The 55-year-old former MEP has fronted the government for the last 18 months, which included the six months from January 2019 when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/30/romania-to-take-over-eu-presidency-amid-fears-for-rule-of-law\">Romania held the rotating EU presidency</a>, and moving on won\u2019t be easy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee2c88cdf2034f49daa154f2db4fae5eb92becea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee2c88cdf2034f49daa154f2db4fae5eb92becea/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A demonstrator holds a cardboard cut-out of Viorica D\u0103ncil\u0103 in front of her office building in Bucharest, Romania.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A demonstrator holds a cardboard cut-out of Viorica D\u0103ncil\u0103 in front of her office building in Bucharest, Romania.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Catu/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As with Brexit in Britain, the fight against corruption and changes to the judiciary in Romania have dominated political discourse in recent years. The country ranks among the EU\u2019s most corrupt states, according to Transparency International, with Brussels having kept its judicial system, along with that of neighbouring Bulgaria, under special monitoring since the countries joined the bloc in 2007.</p> <p>Another source of tension between Bucharest and Brussels is the negotiations over the head of the new European public prosecutor\u2019s office. Laura Codru\u0163a K\u00f6vesi, the former head of Romania\u2019s anti-corruption agency, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/05/romania-moves-to-block-own-candidate-from-eu-prosecutor-role\">strongly opposed by her own government</a> but favoured by the European parliament.</p> <p>K\u00f6vesi, who made a name for herself as an anti-corruption crusader going after top politicians, was fired last year in a move that many believe was politically motivated. After being shortlisted for the new pan-European role this year, criminal proceedings were launched against K\u00f6vesi back home and she was temporarily banned from leaving the country or talking to the press.</p> <p>D\u0103ncil\u0103 would not be drawn on whether her government would continue to oppose K\u00f6vesi\u2019s appointment, but said that she personally believed K\u00f6vesi must \u201csolve her issues with the justice system\u201d before taking this kind of role. \u201cWhat do we do if those accusations are real? I don\u2019t know if they are real or not, it\u2019s a hypothesis, but I believe that the Romanian image will be affected and I want my country\u2019s image to be very good,\u201d she added.</p> <p>D\u0103ncil\u0103 must deal with her own image problems, having been plagued throughout her time in office by accusations that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/08/his-ideology-is-himself-the-shadowy-figure-calling-the-shots-in-romania-liviu-dragnea\">she was appointed simply to serve as a proxy for Dragnea</a>, who was unable to become prime minister due to a previous conviction for electoral fraud.

      "bodyText": "In less than 48 hours in May, Romania\u2019s ruling party was given a triple dose of reality when it was badly beaten in European parliamentary elections, rebuked in a referendum on its attempt to reverse tough anti-corruption laws and had its powerful party leader, Liviu Dragnea, jailed for three-and-a-half years for abuse of office. It was a stinging reproach for the Social Democratic party (PSD), after two and a half years of what many considered government-led attacks on the rule of law that caused the largest protests in the country since the fall of communism and led to the president, Klaus Iohannis, calling the public vote on what critics said were ruling party efforts to make it more difficult to combat rampant state corruption. More than 80% backed a ban on the government having powers to change judicial legislation by emergency decree and the use of pardons in corruption-related cases, as the PSD\u2019s vote share simultaneously more than halved from the 45% it won in the 2016 general election. Sitting in a plush meeting room in the main government building in Bucharest, Viorica D\u0103ncil\u0103, the Romanian prime minister, is blunt about the beating her party took. \u201cI consider these elections not as a victory of the opposition parties but as a defeat for the PSD,\u201d she said. However, she believes her party can turn things around. In the aftermath of the May votes, D\u0103ncil\u0103 vowed to abandon the controversial judicial proposals, a pledge she reiterated this week. \u201cWe have understood the message from 26 May. We have not spoken about the justice system, we have not let anybody get involved on that topic \u2026 I would like to go back to the agenda that is focused on the citizen, less on the justice system,\u201d she said. The 55-year-old former MEP has fronted the government for the last 18 months, which included the six months from January 2019 when Romania held the rotating EU presidency, and moving on won\u2019t be easy. As with Brexit in Britain, the fight against corruption and changes to the judiciary in Romania have dominated political discourse in recent years. The country ranks among the EU\u2019s most corrupt states, according to Transparency International, with Brussels having kept its judicial system, along with that of neighbouring Bulgaria, under special monitoring since the countries joined the bloc in 2007. Another source of tension between Bucharest and Brussels is the negotiations over the head of the new European public prosecutor\u2019s office. Laura Codru\u0163a K\u00f6vesi, the former head of Romania\u2019s anti-corruption agency, is strongly opposed by her own government but favoured by the European parliament. K\u00f6vesi, who made a name for herself as an anti-corruption crusader going after top politicians, was fired last year in a move that many believe was politically motivated. After being shortlisted for the new pan-European role this year, criminal proceedings were launched against K\u00f6vesi back home and she was temporarily banned from leaving the country or talking to the press. D\u0103ncil\u0103 would not be drawn on whether her government would continue to oppose K\u00f6vesi\u2019s appointment, but said that she personally believed K\u00f6vesi must \u201csolve her issues with the justice system\u201d before taking this kind of role. \u201cWhat do we do if those accusations are real? I don\u2019t know if they are real or not, it\u2019s a hypothesis, but I believe that the Romanian image will be affected and I want my country\u2019s image to be very good,\u201d she added. D\u0103ncil\u0103 must deal with her own image problems, having been plagued throughout her time in office by accusations that she was appointed simply to serve as a proxy for Dragnea, who was unable to become prime minister due to a previous conviction for electoral fraud. She was installed as his successor as the leader of the PSD last month. \u201cWe cannot debate her performance as a prime minister,\u201d said Dan Barna, the leader of the opposition Save Romania Union party. \u201cNobody in Romania really believes she is the credible prime minister and the one who\u2019s deciding the direction of the party.\u201d D\u0103ncil\u0103 pushed back against this perception. \u201cThese accusations came mostly from the opposition,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cThe prime minister runs the government \u2026 Mr Dragnea wasn\u2019t coming here to the government, or providing indications to the government.\u201d Andrei \u0162\u0103ranu, the deputy dean of the National University of Political Studies and Public Administration in Bucharest, believes that D\u0103ncil\u0103 and her government will struggle to turn around public perception in the short term. \u201cThe people still don\u2019t like her; they still have some doubts about her proficiency,\u201d he said. D\u0103ncil\u0103, for her part, points to strong economic growth and says her government is focusing on areas such as education, health and infrastructure. Improving relations with Brussels will be another priority, though D\u0103ncil\u0103 believes there are double standards at work within the EU that need to be addressed. \u201cSince 2011 we are meeting all the technical criteria for joining Schengen. [But] the political decision is against us joining the Schengen area,\u201d she said, referring to the border-free area of the EU. She also pointed to the ongoing judicial monitoring of Romanian and Bulgaria. \u201cIf the CVM [Cooperation and Verification Mechanism] would be valid for all member states then I wouldn\u2019t be speaking about a double standard, but when it\u2019s applied for only two states \u2013 I\u2019m not going to comment about the content, about whether some of them are fair or unfair, but the principle of it,\u201d she added.

      "bodyText": "Baz Luhrmann\u2019s Elvis Presley biopic has found its King. After a competitive casting contest, the 27-year-old actor Austin Butler has been chosen to play Presley, Warner Bros announced on Monday. Ansel Elgort, Harry Styles and Miles Teller all reportedly tested for the role ultimately won by Butler, a Nickelodeon and Disney Channel alumni who last year made his Broadway debut in the revival of The Iceman Cometh starring Denzel Washington. Butler posted the news to Instagram, quoting from Presley\u2019s hit Love Me Tender: \u201cYou have made my life complete, and I love you so.\u201d Luhrmann, the Oscar-nominated film-maker behind The Great Gatsby and Moulin Rouge!, said: \u201cI knew I couldn\u2019t make this film if the casting wasn\u2019t absolutely right, and we searched thoroughly for an actor with the ability to evoke the singular natural movement and vocal qualities of this peerless star, but also the inner vulnerability of the artist \u2026 \u201cThrough a journey of extensive screen testing and music and performance workshops, I knew unequivocally that I had found someone who could embody the spirit of one of the world\u2019s most iconic musical figures.\u201d The film explores Presley\u2019s life through the lens of his complicated, 20-year relationship with his manager, Colonel Tom Parker, who will be played by Tom Hanks. The screenplay was written by Luhrmann and Craig Pearce, with Luhrmann also co-producing alongside the Oscar-winner Catherine Martin, his partner and frequent collaborator. As on The Great Gatsby and Moulin Rouge! before it, Martin will also serve as production and costume designer. Production is to begin early next year, with filming taking place in Queensland, Australia. Butler, who has a role in Jim Jarmusch\u2019s The Dead Don\u2019t Die, has also been cast in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s upcoming Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood, set in 1960s Los Angeles and starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie. with Associated Press",

They are reported to be headed to an appropriate property on the Mornington Peninsula.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/10/australian-gulls-found-to-carry-antibiotic-resistant-superbugs\">Australian gulls found to carry antibiotic-resistant superbugs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cEffort has been taken to identify a contractor with a high degree of experience in carrying out similar moves and appropriate rehousing of domestic waterfowl,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Bainbridge said there were also significant environmental benefits to removing the geese, whose long-term presence can cause algal blooms that would kill aquatic vegetation, making the lake unsuitable for native waterfowl such as black swans.</p> <p>But he warned that removing the geese posed a possible \u201creputational risk\u201d to the council from both residents and visitors. Disappointment and opposition from some sections of the community was anticipated.</p> <p>\u201cInteraction with domestic waterfowl on the lake is an attraction for some visitors and residents while negative interactions with protective geese may reduce the appeal of the lake in the short term for others,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BzCpSH9pPn3/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "A plan to relocate a flock of domestic geese in the Victorian tourist town of Daylesford has drawn concern from some local tourism operators, who say the geese are a popular Instagram drawcard. The Hepburn shire council will vote on Tuesday night on whether to relocate the 30-odd domestic geese, which have been living on Lake Daylesford in increasing numbers for several years. The move follows a number of complaints about the birds to the council, and reports that aggressive geese have \u201cintimidated\u201d visitors. In a detailed report to the council, biodiversity officer Brian Bainbridge recommended the geese be relocated, at cost of $2,750, to save the council an annual spend of $5,000 in trying to clean droppings off the jetty and footpaths, and to reverse the presumption that the council is overlooking a crime \u2013 to whit, the abandonment of domestic animals \u2013 for the sake of a picturesque vista. He said the animals would not be harmed in the removal. They are reported to be headed to an appropriate property on the Mornington Peninsula. \u201cEffort has been taken to identify a contractor with a high degree of experience in carrying out similar moves and appropriate rehousing of domestic waterfowl,\u201d he said. Bainbridge said there were also significant environmental benefits to removing the geese, whose long-term presence can cause algal blooms that would kill aquatic vegetation, making the lake unsuitable for native waterfowl such as black swans. But he warned that removing the geese posed a possible \u201creputational risk\u201d to the council from both residents and visitors. Disappointment and opposition from some sections of the community was anticipated. \u201cInteraction with domestic waterfowl on the lake is an attraction for some visitors and residents while negative interactions with protective geese may reduce the appeal of the lake in the short term for others,\u201d he said. Among those disappointed with the proposal is Daylesford Lake House co-owner Alla Wolf-Tasker, who told the ABC the geese were commonly photographed for Instagram. In a statement, the Lake House said the geese were \u201cenormously popular with guests\u201d and \u201cbring a vital sense of \u2018country\u2019 to the lake environs essential in continuing to attract visitors wanting to escape the urban jungle\u201d. The geese do feature prominently on the social media platform. \u201cThere is no question that the geese have become a feature of the lake \u2013 there are literally thousands of photographs of them over all social media platforms,\u201d the Lake House said. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that it may be prudent to reduce the flock a little; but we hope that there will be more deliberation and consideration taken.\u201d The Lake House said it had only seen the geese \u201cacting in a protective manner\u201d during nesting seasons, but noted that magpies do the same. It also said that the lake was still home to \u201can abundance\u201d of other native birdlife. Some local businesses have begun rallying their followers in defence of the birds. Wolf-Tasker said there would be a social media backlash if the geese were removed. \u201cThe geese provide an enormous amount of pleasure to a lot of people,\u201d she said.",

      "bodyText": "The Sydney Morning Herald and Age newspapers have lost an appeal against a defamation payment of $300,000 to international cricketer Chris Gayle, who was wrongly accused of exposing himself to a female massage therapist in 2015. The court of appeal unanimously dismissed the appeal from the former Fairfax media group as well as a cross-appeal from Gayle who wanted to increase the amount of damages. The newspapers alleged the Jamaican cricketer indecently exposed himself to a team masseur in the dressing room of a suburban oval in Sydney during the 2015 World Cup. But a jury believed Gayle, who said the masseur had fabricated the allegation. Gayle and teammate Dwayne Smith, who was in the dressing room when the alleged incident took place, both gave evidence in the supreme court before justice Lucy McCallum in 2017. The four jurors also found Fairfax was motivated by malice when it published the articles. The publisher argued it did not receive a fair trial because Gayle\u2019s barrister, Bruce McClintock SC, had launched a \u201cpretty full-throttled attack\u201d on the credibility of masseur Leanne Russell. The court of appeal found the closing address had been unfair to the masseur and had impugned her credibility but directions from McCallum to the jury had mitigated the effect. The directions to the jury \u201cmust have ameliorated the unfairness occasioned by Mr Gayle\u2019s counsel\u2019s departure from the pleaded case\u201d, the appeal court found. McClintock had attacked Russell\u2019s credibility in the original trial by bringing up an eating disorder she suffered and saying people with eating disorders were prone to lie.",

We saw this when Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/911789314169823232\">tweeted a threat</a> at North Korean leader <strong>Kim Jong Un</strong>, when he tweeted a video <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jul/02/trump-body-slam-cnn-tweet-violence-reporters-wrestlemania\">encouraging violence</a> against CNN and when he retweeted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/29/trump-account-retweets-anti-muslim-videos-of-british-far-right-leader\">racist misinformation</a> by a British hate figure. </p> <p>Throughout it all, <strong>Twitter</strong> has declined to take any actions against Trump\u2019s account, recognizing that censoring the president of the United States is not necessarily something that a private company wants to do \u2013 or that citizens of a democracy should want a private company to be able to do. </p> <p>Just last month, Twitter announced a new policy that would allow it to split the baby when it comes to violations of Twitter\u2019s rules by Trump and other world leaders: a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/27/twitter-warning-labels-tweets-violate-site-rules\">special label</a> that would be affixed to tweets by major political figures if they violated Twitter\u2019s rules, but deleting them would not be in the public\u2019s interest. </p> <p>But don\u2019t hold your breath waiting for Twitter to add such a label to Trump\u2019s racist rant against four progressive congresswomen.

He reverted to his previous position of army secretary. </p> <p>Filling in for Esper pending his confirmation is Richard Spencer, who has been the civilian leader of the Navy since August 2017. <br>Spencer\u2019s tenure as acting secretary is expected to be brief. Esper will have his Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday and could be confirmed as early as Thursday. Spencer would then return to the navy. </p> <p>As soon as he took the handoff from Esper, Spencer sent a brief letter to all military and civilian personnel of the Defense Department. <br>\u201cWhile my time in this role is anticipated to be brief, I am fully prepared and committed to serve as Acting Secretary of Defense, and I will provide continuity in the leadership of the department,\u201d Spencer said. </p> <p>He said American allies and partners \u201ccan rest assured\u201d that during this transition the Pentagon remains ready to meet its global commitments. <br>Spencer, a native of Connecticut, joined the Marine Corps after graduating from Rollins College in 1976. He served in the marines until 1981 as an H-46 helicopter pilot, according to his official navy biography. <br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-15T22:39:49.849Z\">at 11.39pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d2ce3948f08d0b6ca531410\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-15T20:38:31.958Z\">9.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">House progressive freshman members attacked by Trump to hold press conference</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>House Democrats <strong>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib</strong> will hold a press conference on Capitol Hill at 5PM local time today.</p> <p>The four progressive freshman members who have been repeatedly attacked by the president in the last 24 hours, several times in raw, racist language, are getting ready to address the issue together.</p> <p>We\u2019ll carry a live feed, so stay tuned.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-15T20:39:57.459Z\">at 9.39pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d2ce0d58f08cf92bb7707d0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-15T20:33:27.670Z\">9.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Mitch McConnell declines to address Trump\u2019s criticism of women of color in Congress</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans\">Republican</a> Senate majority leader told reporters today that he\u2019d \u201caddress whatever questions\u201d we may have at his regularly scheduled press conference tomorrow. </p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/06/mitch-mcconnell-senate-republicans-donald-trump-judges\">Mitch McConnell</a></strong> is extremely good at staying silent during Trumpian outrages.

Epstein, 66, was arrested on July 6 after flying into New Jersey\u2019s Teterboro Airport by private plane from Paris. </p> <p>He has pleaded not guilty and is being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, a fortress-like jail in lower Manhattan that has been criticized by inmates and lawyers for harsh conditions. </p> <p>Epstein, who was once known for socializing with politicians and royalty, is accused of arranging for girls under the age of 18 to perform nude \u201cmassages\u201d and other sex acts, and of paying some girls to recruit others, from at least 2002 to 2005. </p> <p>Prosecutors said a search of Epstein\u2019s home uncovered nude images of underage girls, and they accused him of paying two potential witnesses against him last year in an apparent effort to influence them. </p> <p>He faces up to 45 years in prison if convicted. </p> <p>Seeking their client\u2019s release from pre-trial detention, Epstein\u2019s lawyers have said he is willing to pay for armed guards to monitor him round-the-clock at his Upper East Side home.</p> <p>We\u2019ll have our own account from our reporter in court shortly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b62156c40ef05920f27f71eb60feaaf9a7bbc39\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b62156c40ef05920f27f71eb60feaaf9a7bbc39/0_126_3774_2264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeffrey Epstein appears in court in West Palm Beach, Florida, on 30 July 2008.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeffrey Epstein appears in court in West Palm Beach, Florida, on 30 July 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Uma Sanghvi/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-15T15:25:36.600Z\">at 4.25pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d2c8ed18f08d0b6ca5310cc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-15T14:42:37.317Z\">3.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <h2>Pressley brushes off Trump\u2019s tweets \u2013 but not his treatment of refugees</h2> <p>That\u2019s the headline in a piece from the <strong>Boston Globe</strong> last night.

The House of Representatives passes legislation regarding Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post journalist killed last year. The United Nations noted \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that the crown prince of Saudi Arabia and other senior officials are liable for the killing. Once upon a time, four congresswomen holding a press conference about something racist that you put on social media would have been a career-ender. Today, Trump\u2019s reelection campaign is making the best of it by really leaning into the racism: To recap: representative Ilhan Omar was asked an incredibly Islamophobic question about Trump repeatedly calling her a communist and saying she supports al-Qaida. She made a poignant point about how every single Muslim in this country has had to deal with questions like this at some point in their lives, and then said she would not dignify the question with an answer. Around the time representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib began their press conference about President Trump and his racist attack on them, the Tweeter-in-Chief took to the little blue bird again: As Representative Ilhan Omar pointed out during the press conference, by running on the platform of \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d Trump was criticizing the country by implying that it\u2019s not great at the moment. Therefore, he\u2019s guilty of doing exactly the same thing he\u2019s accusing the four congresswomen of doing: daring to criticize America. If you are not happy here, you can leave? Senator Mitt Romney has decided to jump into the fray: Our senior tech correspondent, Julia Carrie Wong, weighs in on Trump and his racist tweets: Whenever Donald Trump achieves a new low on his Twitter feed, critics cry out for the social media company to take action against the account-in-chief. We saw this when Trump tweeted a threat at North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, when he tweeted a video encouraging violence against CNN and when he retweeted racist misinformation by a British hate figure. Throughout it all, Twitter has declined to take any actions against Trump\u2019s account, recognizing that censoring the president of the United States is not necessarily something that a private company wants to do \u2013 or that citizens of a democracy should want a private company to be able to do. Just last month, Twitter announced a new policy that would allow it to split the baby when it comes to violations of Twitter\u2019s rules by Trump and other world leaders: a special label that would be affixed to tweets by major political figures if they violated Twitter\u2019s rules, but deleting them would not be in the public\u2019s interest. But don\u2019t hold your breath waiting for Twitter to add such a label to Trump\u2019s racist rant against four progressive congresswomen. A Twitter spokeswoman said the tweets did not violate any of the company\u2019s rules. Which means that those looking for a way to combat Trump and his racism will be forced to rely on the institution designed to counterbalance the power of the US presidency: Congress. Representative Alexandria Ocasia-Cortez had a few more zingers at the press conference that I wasn\u2019t fast enough to catch: \u201cThe president can\u2019t defend his policies so what he does is attack us personally.\u201d Interesting point: representative Ayanna Pressley begged the press not to let Trump and his racist comments distract from the real issues. But one of the very first questions went to representative Ilhan Omar, asking her to address \u201crumors\u201d that she was a communist associated with al-Qaida. Omar, to her credit, kept incredibly cool in the face of this very Islamaphobic question, and rightfully pointed out that almost all Americans who are Muslim have had questions of this ilk directed at them at some point in their lives. She said she would not dignify the question with answer. Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib joined in with congresswoman Ilhan Omar in calling for impeachment: \u201cMany members of Congress have called for his impeachment,\u201d she said. \u201cI urge House leadership, many of my colleagues, to take action to impeach.\u201d Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told a touching story about visiting Washington with her father, and spoke to the children of the country: \u201cNo matter what the president says, this country belongs to you,\u201d she said. \u201cIt belongs to everyone.\u201d At this same press conference, congresswoman Ilhan Omar suggested it was time to impeach Trump: \u201cI have not made impeachment central to my election or my tenure,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not if he will be impeached, but when. It is time for us to stop allowing this president to make a mockery of this country.\u201d Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley just spoke at a press conference about President Trump and his recent racist attack on her and representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib. She warned the American public to \u201cnot take the bait\u201d. \u201cThis is a disruptive distraction from the issues of care, concern and consequence to the American people,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is simply a disruption and a distraction from the callous, chaotic and corrupt culture of this administration, all the way down. We want to get down to the business of the American people and why we were sent here.\u201d Hey all, Vivian Ho on the west coast taking over for Joanna Walters. We\u2019re about to livestream a press conference in which representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib will most likely discuss President Trump and his recent racist attack on the four progressive freshman members. Give that a view, and we\u2019ll put up a quick summary of everything once it\u2019s done. Donald Trump this afternoon asked the Senate to confirm Mark Esper as the successor to former defense secretary Jim Mattis. His resignation last December opened an unprecedented period of senior-level instability at the Pentagon, writes the AP. The moment the nomination was received by the Senate on Monday afternoon, Esper was required to step out of his role as acting defense secretary a job he has held since June until he is confirmed as the permanent secretary. He reverted to his previous position of army secretary. Filling in for Esper pending his confirmation is Richard Spencer, who has been the civilian leader of the Navy since August 2017. Spencer\u2019s tenure as acting secretary is expected to be brief. Esper will have his Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday and could be confirmed as early as Thursday. Spencer would then return to the navy. As soon as he took the handoff from Esper, Spencer sent a brief letter to all military and civilian personnel of the Defense Department. \u201cWhile my time in this role is anticipated to be brief, I am fully prepared and committed to serve as Acting Secretary of Defense, and I will provide continuity in the leadership of the department,\u201d Spencer said. He said American allies and partners \u201ccan rest assured\u201d that during this transition the Pentagon remains ready to meet its global commitments. Spencer, a native of Connecticut, joined the Marine Corps after graduating from Rollins College in 1976. He served in the marines until 1981 as an H-46 helicopter pilot, according to his official navy biography. House Democrats Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib will hold a press conference on Capitol Hill at 5PM local time today. The four progressive freshman members who have been repeatedly attacked by the president in the last 24 hours, several times in raw, racist language, are getting ready to address the issue together. We\u2019ll carry a live feed, so stay tuned. The Republican Senate majority leader told reporters today that he\u2019d \u201caddress whatever questions\u201d we may have at his regularly scheduled press conference tomorrow. Mitch McConnell is extremely good at staying silent during Trumpian outrages. Clearly today is no exception. But the Senate\u2019s top Democrat, Chuck Schumer of New York, said Republicans who align with Trump are \u201cmaking a deal with the devil,\u201d the AP writes. Schumer asked GOP colleagues, \u201cWhere are you when something this serious, this bigoted, this un-American happens?\u201d Trump over the weekend said the firebrand freshman group of progressive congress members (known as the Squad) should \u201cgo back\u201d to their own countries. Three of the four were born in the US, and one is a refugee and US citizen. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says the House will vote on a resolution condemning Trump\u2019s tweets. Schumer said Democrats will force a vote in the Senate. Meanwhile, former Arizona Republican Senator Jeff Flake said top congressional Republicans should say Trump\u2019s comments are wrong. He predicted the president\u2019s attacks risked alienating millennials and suburban women already disenchanted with the party. \u201cIt\u2019s just, good grief, you\u2019ve got to stand for something,\u201d he said. Congressman Al Green to force impeachment vote Houston Democrat Al Green, who first called for a vote in the House on impeaching Donald Trump in May 2017, said he plans to force such a vote this month. While Democrats and a smattering of Republicans slammed the president today for his racist tweets on Sunday against the Squad, for Green impeachment is imperative. Green first stood out with an early call for impeachment in May, 2017, after reports emerged that Trump had asked James Comey, shortly before he fired the then-director of the FBI, to shut down the investigation into Michael Flynn when he was briefly National Security Adviser. Green tried a few times since, never successfully, obviously, but in recent times has been joined by more Democrats, including 2020 candidates, with calls led by Elizabeth Warren. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said this afternoon that the administration and Congress are getting close to a deal on raising the US debt ceiling. He\u2019s urged lawmakers to take action on the issue before their August recess. \u201cI think there is a preference on both parties, to the extent that we can agree on the debt ceiling and a budget deal, that that is the first choice, and I think that we\u2019re getting closer,\u201d Mnuchin told reporters during a briefing at the White House, Reuters reports. Mnuchin said that if a deal on all of the issues were not reached before lawmakers were scheduled to take off, they should either stay put or approve an increase in the debt ceiling on its own. \u201cI think we\u2019re very close to a deal, but as you know, these deals are complicated,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m very hopeful we can come to ... an agreement quickly, but having said that, if for whatever reason we cannot agree on all these issues before they leave, I would either expect them to stick around or raise the debt ceiling.\u201d Mnuchin said he was not concerned about the prospect of a government shutdown related to the budget discussions. By the way, he also said Trump\u2019s racist tweets about the Squad aren\u2019t racist.... The fear, tension and anger remain, but there are no reports yet of the kind of systematic, ruthless anti-immigration raids the government had flagged would happen on Sunday. Astonishingly, after the president has hyped and politicized this for weeks, months even, acting Customs and Border Protection (CBP) commissioner Mark Morgan told Fox earlier today that \u201ca lot of this was overhyped and over-politicized.\u201d He discouraged use of the term \u201craids\u201d and said that targeted enforcement operations as just part of what Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) does each day. There had been expectations that up to 2,000 people with deportation orders would be apprehended on Sunday in major cities across the US, which was paralyzing whole communities and putting families on edge. It\u2019s been a lively Monday so far, with no signs of it slowing down. Here\u2019s what\u2019s occurred so far: It started slowly (very slowly), but Republicans in Congress are starting to step up and slam Donald Trump for his racist tweets against the Squad. Some object to the style, some to the style and the substance. Trump held a raucous press conference and accused firebrand progressives of hating America and saying if that was the case \u201cyou can leave\u201d. Nancy Pelosi announced that House Democrats will be drafting a resolution condemning Trump\u2019s racist tweet storm, and voting on it Author E. Jean Carroll is weighing whether to sue the president. He\u2019s accused of raping her in the past when he attacked her in upscale New York department store Bergdorf Goodman. Politically-connected convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein had his bail hearing in New York, in the latest case against him, postponed to Thursday. Two alleged victims spoke in court against him being let out of jail. The Trump administration announced a new rule seeking to bar asylum applications for migrants entering the US via a third country. The ACLU immediately said the rule was \u201cpatently unlawful\u201d The South Carolina Senator has responded to Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on the Squad. Tim Scott, who is the only black Republican in the US Senate, tweeted just now. Appointed by then-SC governor Nikki Haley to replace the retiring Jim DeMint, Scott later won a special election in 2014 and was elected to a full term in 2016. \u201cThis needs to stop\u201d Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska joins what is now a small but shrill (in the best sense of the word) chorus of protest from GOP members of Congress, inc Hurd, Collins, Toomey, against Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on a group of progressive freshman Democrats. Trudeau, prime minister of Canada has joined Britain\u2019s (still, just) Prime Minister Theresa May in condemning Donald Trump\u2019s racist attack on the Squad. \u201cThat is not how we do things in Canada,\u201d Trudeau said today. Speaking at a press conference with Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary-general of NATO, Trudeau said that sort of talk isn\u2019t welcome. \u201cI think Canadians and indeed people around the world know exactly what I think about those particular comments. That is not how we do things in Canada. A Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian. The diversity of our country is actually one of our greatest strengths and a source of tremendous resilience and pride for Canadians and we will to continue to defend that,\u201d Trudeau said, the CBC reports. Now Trump calls Pelosi racist as row over his tweets about Squad roars on Alternative headline: fierce, unpleasant debate continues at bottom of barrel. Per White House Pool reporters, Donald Trump said it was racist of Speaker Nancy Pelosi to suggest last week that he wants to \u201cmake American white again.\u201d Then he referred to comments that member of Congress Ilhan Omar (D-MN) made that he said were about al Qaeda. Oh dear. Omar has previously seen a spike in death threats when the president attacks her. The White House exterior had been packed with supporters, who applauded the president\u2019s comments at the Made in America presentation. Moments earlier, Trump signed an executive order that he said will make \u201cBuy America\u201d product requirements \u201cstronger\u201d. They require 95 % of a product be made in country, for steel and aluminum to be considered made in America, and 75% for other products to qualify. Currently the requirement is 50%. Then he continued on his warpath with the progressives, when he said \u201cthese are people\u201d - he means AOC, Omar and their left-wing allies - \u201cwho hate our country\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m not happy with them,\u201d he added. As gathered media shouted questions, Trump said \u201cIt doesn\u2019t concern me\u201d that many people saw the tweets he sent yesterday as racist, \u201cbecause many people agree with me.\u201d Trump just closed out a brief but raucous press conference at the White House. He\u2019s doubling down on his criticism of firebrand progressives in the House. \u201cThese are people who hate our country,\u201d Trump said of AOC, Pressley, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar. \u201cAll I am saying is if they\u2019re not happy here, they can leave. They can leave and you know what I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be many people that won\u2019t miss them. They have to love our country.\u201d He, of course, denies that the tweets he sent yesterday are racist. And, whether this increases divisions in the Democratic party or not, between progressives and moderates, personified by public tension between AOC and Pelosi, the Speaker is busy announcing a resolution condemning the president\u2019s attacks. We\u2019ll have a video of this for you very soon. Meanwhile, a reminder of how, earlier, Trump called on the Squad to apologize.... Moderate Republican Susan Collins has now weighed in on Trump\u2019s attacks on the Squad. The president is speaking at the White House, further attacking the progressive Democrats he went after on Twitter at the weekend and this morning. \u201cThese are people, in my opinion, who hate America,\u201d Donald Trump said. He\u2019s referring to \u201cthe Squad\u201d, Democratic progressive newcomers to Capitol Hill, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar and Ayanna Pressley. \u201cIf you\u2019re not happy here, you can leave,\u201d he said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced a resolution condemning Donald Trump for his racist tweets (which some loyalists have insisted are NOT racist...). Democrats are drafting the resolution today. \u201cThis weekend, the president went beyond his own low standards using disgraceful language about Members of Congress,\u201d Pelosi wrote in a letter to House Democrats announcing the party\u2019s plans, Politico reports. It\u2019s unclear when the House will be called to vote on this, following an avalanche of attacks by Trump on freshman congress members Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley and Ilhan Omar. But Pelosi said: \u201cThis morning, the president doubled down on his attacks on our four colleagues suggesting they apologize to him,\u201d she added. \u201cLet me be clear, our Caucus will continue to forcefully respond to these disgusting attacks.\u201d After months of delay, Donald Trump is expected to nominate a successor to Jim Mattis as secretary of defense on Monday. It will be Mark Esper, who has been serving as acting secretary of defense since June, when Patrick Shanahan abruptly quit after serving as the acting secretary for six months. Mattis resigned last December. The leadership vacuum at the Pentagon has raised questions in Congress at a time of heightened tensions with Iran, the Associated Press reports. Once Esper\u2019s nomination is received by the Senate, Esper would step aside pending confirmation. His confirmation hearing is scheduled for Tuesday. In Esper\u2019s absence, the civilian head of the Navy, Richard Spencer, would be acting defense secretary. That arrangement would last only a few days, if Esper is confirmed quickly by the Senate as expected. Two Jeffrey Epstein accusers offered emotional entreaties in court on Monday, asking for a judge not to release the politically-connected financier before his sex trafficking trial. One victim, who identified herself in court as Courtney Wild, told the judge: \u201cI was sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein, starting at the age of 14,\u201d Victoria Bekiempis reports this hour from court, for the Guardian. She said that it was not necessarily easier because of the publicity to come forward, as she said defense attorneys have argued in court. \u201cHe\u2019s a scary person to have walking the streets,\u201d she said. She had a reserved air, wearing a white shirt and black pants as she nervously addressed the judge towards the end of Epstein\u2019s hearing in federal court in New York on Monday. The second accuser, Annie Farmer, stood up and said: \u201cI was 16 years old when I had the misfortune of meeting Jeffrey Epstein here in New York.\u201d She spoke about how it was difficult to come forward in public, because of his wealth and privilege. The judge asked her if she was saying that Jeffrey Epstein engaged in sexual contact with her. She said: \u201cHe was inappropriate with me.\u201d The Judge asked her is she would go into details. She said: \u201cI would prefer not to go into the details at this time.\u201d The judge in the case had already said he would not decide on bail today, probably on Thursday. Prosecutors think Epstein\u2019s an extreme flight risk. Epstein has asked for house arrest, his attorneys basically arguing that if he was going to flee he could have done so long ago. He\u2019s currently in jail in Manhattan. \u201cRacist, Xenophobic\u201d - Congressman from border country attacks Trump after racist tweets Texas Congressman Will Hurd said: Here\u2019s Pennsylvania Republican Senator Pat Toomey\u2019s statement, proving that even if congressional Republicans are in lock-step with the White House, some are prepared to break rank not just in the gossip parlors but in public, too. #MeToomey \u201cI accused Donald Trump of sexual assault. Now I sleep with a loaded gun\u201d E. Jean Carroll gave this amazing interview to the Guardian\u2019s Ed Pilkington recently and if you missed it it\u2019s, well, unmissable. Click for the pix of her talking to Donald and Ivana at a party, stay for the brilliant words and photoshoot. It will remain to be seen if Carroll sues.... The author and columnist is now thinking of suing Trump over an alleged rape. E. Jean Carroll accused him of a sexual attack in a top New York department store in the past, in a revelatory bombshell first published by New York magazine. The alleged assault occurred long before New York lifted its statute of limitations against rape, but, now, Carroll said she is \u201cthinking about hiring a really smart attorney\u201d to pursue legal action against the president. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought about pressing charges, but now people are convincing me that it\u2019s smart,\u201d she told The Daily Beast. \u201cIf I get a really smart attorney, we might be able to get around [the statute]. I\u2019ll be exploring it.\u201d Previously, Carroll appeared on The Last Word with Lawrence O\u2019Donnell and when she was asked if she planned on filing charges, she said she would not. \u201cI would find it disrespectful to the women who are down on the border who are being raped around the clock down there without any protection,\u201d Carroll explained. What the new asylum rule affects The new rule emerging from the Trump administration today will apply to the initial asylum screening, known as a \u201ccredible fear\u201d interview, at which migrants must prove they have credible fears of returning to their home country. It applies to migrants who are arriving to the US, not those who are already in the country. Trump administration officials say the changes are meant to close the gap between the initial asylum screening that most people pass and the final decision on asylum that most people do not win. The treaties countries must have signed, according to the new rule, are the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, the 1967 Protocol or the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the AP writes. But, for example, while Australia, France and Brazil have signed those treaties, so have Afghanistan and Libya, places the US does not consider safe. Along with the administration\u2019s recent effort to send asylum seekers back over the border , Trump has tried to deny asylum to anyone crossing the border illegally and restrict who can claim asylum, and the attorney general recently tried to keep thousands of asylum seekers detained while their cases play out. Nearly all of those efforts have been blocked by courts. Meanwhile, conditions have worsened for migrants who make it over the border seeking better lives. Immigration courts are backlogged by more than 800,000 cases, meaning many people won\u2019t have their asylum claims heard for years despite more judges being hired. People are generally eligible for asylum in the US if they feared return to their home country because they would be persecuted based on race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group. During the budget year for 2009, there were 35,811 asylum claims, and 8,384 were granted. During 2018 budget year, there were 162,060 claims filed, and 13,168 were granted. Another Republican steps up on Trump tweets Made in America In about 20 minutes, Donald Trump is scheduled to host the third annual Made in America product showcase, according to the White House schedule. I wonder if AOC, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley will be on pedestals there, as they were all, literally, made in America.... AOC hits back \u2018Beneath the dignity of the office\u2019 John Kasich steps up. He ain\u2019t campaigning for the presidency again (at the moment) but he\u2019s the front runner for GOP Voice of Reason. If that\u2019s not an oxymoron - okay maybe I\u2019m just too partisan, there. Dude speaks good sense a lot of the time, like an old-school Republican moderate/endangered species. From Ohio to you: Palm Beach: so small, so wealthy, so...creepy Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s piece by Ed Pilkington on how the Miami Herald exposed a vast criminal network and a government cover-up in relation to Jeffrey Epstein \u2013 but there was a deafening silence elsewhere..... Dripping in diamonds and intrigue Investigators found the latest cache of diamonds in his Manhattan townhouse. Diamonds, wads of cash and a Saudi \u2018passport\u2019, oh my... A federal prosecutor on Monday said the evidence against accused child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein is \u201calready significantly strong and getting stronger every single day\u201d since his arrest last week. Alex Rossmiller, the prosecutor, at a detention hearing in Manhattan federal court told a judge that multiple witnesses have contacted authorities since Epstein was arrested, and that prosecutors are trying to corroborate their allegation, NBC reports. And Rossmiller also said that federal investigators had found in Epstein\u2019s Manhattan townhouse a locked safe containing cash, diamonds and an expired passport from another country that has Epstein\u2019s photograph on it, but with a different name and a stated residence of Saudi Arabia. Hearing likely to go ahead on Thursday A US judge said he will probably decide on Thursday whether Jeffrey Epstein, the American financier with lots of ties to the elite, charged with sex trafficking underage girls, should remain in jail while awaiting trial or be allowed to live under house arrest at his Manhattan mansion. At a hearing in New York on Monday, US District Judge Richard Berman in Manhattan said he will probably announce his decision on July 18 at 9.30AM local time, saying he needs more time to absorb materials that have been submitted, the Associated Press writes. He noted that several people who said they are among Epstein\u2019s victims and opposed bail were in attendance, and that they may speak at the hearing. Epstein, 66, was arrested on July 6 after flying into New Jersey\u2019s Teterboro Airport by private plane from Paris. He has pleaded not guilty and is being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, a fortress-like jail in lower Manhattan that has been criticized by inmates and lawyers for harsh conditions. Epstein, who was once known for socializing with politicians and royalty, is accused of arranging for girls under the age of 18 to perform nude \u201cmassages\u201d and other sex acts, and of paying some girls to recruit others, from at least 2002 to 2005. Prosecutors said a search of Epstein\u2019s home uncovered nude images of underage girls, and they accused him of paying two potential witnesses against him last year in an apparent effort to influence them. He faces up to 45 years in prison if convicted. Seeking their client\u2019s release from pre-trial detention, Epstein\u2019s lawyers have said he is willing to pay for armed guards to monitor him round-the-clock at his Upper East Side home. We\u2019ll have our own account from our reporter in court shortly. Pressley brushes off Trump\u2019s tweets \u2013 but not his treatment of refugees That\u2019s the headline in a piece from the Boston Globe last night. Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley tells her daily newspaper that she doesn\u2019t refer to Trump as president. And that the Squad is a lot bigger than AOC, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and her. Here\u2019s a quote from the piece: \u201cI never use the word you used \u2013 president \u2013 to describe him,\u201d she said. \u201cI refer to him as \u2018the occupant.\u2019 He simply occupies the space. He embodies zero of the qualities and the principles, the responsibility, the grace, the integrity, the compassion, of someone who would truly embody that office. It\u2019s just another day in the world under this administration.\u201d Tlaib just tweeted it out, and AOC retweeted. Squad on fire! AOC has retweeted: \u2018Hallmark language of white supremacists\u2019 AOC continues hitting back on yesterday\u2019s tweets: \u201cMaybe he meant go back to the district they came from...\u201d Breathtaking, as GOP breaks radio silence on Trump\u2019s racist tweets. \u2018They wanted to impeach President Trump on DAY ONE\u2019 The last two tweets in this rant are: And: Wow. Trump attacks on \u2018the Squad\u2019 continues He goes on.... Trump calls progressives \u201ca bunch of Communists\u201d The president continues his tear on Twitter against the Squad, calling out Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and \u201cthis crowd\u201d. Wait, there\u2019s more.... An American Civil Liberties Union attorney says the new Trump administration rule that bars most Central American migrants from seeking asylum at the US-Mexico border can\u2019t stand. It is \u201cpatently unlawful,\u201d attorney Lee Gelernt says of the rule. If it goes into effect, would effectively eliminate asylum for those at the southern border. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act governing asylum in the US, anyone can claim asylum at the border regardless of how he or she arrived. There are some exceptions, including whether an asylum seeker passed through a \u201csafe\u201d country first, the AP writes. AG Bill Barr comments on new Trump asylum policy Barr just issued the following statement: \u201cThis Rule is a lawful exercise of authority provided by Congress to restrict eligibility for asylum. \u201cThe United States is a generous country but is being completely overwhelmed by the burdens associated with apprehending and processing hundreds of thousands of aliens along the southern border. \u201cThis Rule will decrease forum shopping by economic migrants and those who seek to exploit our asylum system to obtain entry to the United States - while ensuring that no-one is removed from the United Staes who is more likely that not to be tortured or persecuted on account of a protected ground.\u201d Republican radio silence on Trump\u2019s racist tweets The row goes on about Trump\u2019s tweets about the Squad, which is all part of the ongoing immigration policy fireworks that are squirting rockets in every direction. For the full report on this, I refer you to our lead news story on the US site this morning. We\u2019ll be touching on it here, too. Acting director of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service, Ken Cuccinelli, talking earlier on CNN, said \u201cNo\u201d when asked by Alisyn Camerota if the tweets were racist. But he did call them \u201cpolitical hand grenades.\u201d No kidding. Guatemalan officials expected in Washington Apparently a meeting between Trump and Guatemalan president Jimmy Morales was canceled amid a court challenge in Guatemala over whether the country could agree to a \u2018safe third\u2019 with the US. Trump administration officials say the changes are meant to close the gap between the initial asylum screening that most people pass and the final decision on asylum that most people do not win. But immigrant rights groups, religious leaders and humanitarian groups have said the Republican administration\u2019s policies amount to a cruel and calloused effort to keep immigrants out of the country, the AP writes. Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador are poor countries suffering from violence, poverty and, disproportionately to many places, the effects of the climate crisis. Along with the administration\u2019s recent effort to send asylum seekers back over the border to wait for their legal process to play out, Donald Trump has tried to deny asylum to anyone crossing the border illegally and restrict who can claim asylum, and attorney general William Barr recently tried to keep thousands of asylum seekers detained while their cases play out. Nearly all of those efforts have been blocked by courts. Trump administration tries essentially to end asylum protections via the US-Mexico border The president and the anti-immigration voices in and around the White House constantly buzzing in his ear, urging him to stoke the base and further divide Democrats, while seemingly appealing to Trump\u2019s id, won\u2019t wait for Congress. There will be some exceptions to the new rule, the AP writes. If someone has been trafficked, if the country the migrant passed through did not sign one of the major international treaties that govern how refugees are managed (though most Western countries have signed them) or if an asylum-seeker sought protection in a country but was denied. In those cases, a migrant could still apply for US asylum after crossing the US-Mexico border unlawfully. But the move is meant is aimed at ending asylum protections. The system was already in chaos after Trump administration crackdowns on asylum. The new policy is almost certain to face a legal challenge, AP writes. US law allows refugees to request asylum when they arrive in the US regardless of how they did so, but there is an exception for those who have come through a country considered to be \u201csafe.\u201d The Immigration and Nationality Act, which governs asylum law, is vague on how a country is determined \u201csafe\u201d, however. It says \u201cpursuant to a bilateral or multilateral agreement.\u201d The US has such an agreement, known as a safe third country, only with Canada. Under a recent agreement with Mexico, Central American countries were considering a \u201cregional compact\u201d on the issue, but nothing has been decided. Do take a look back at the Guardian\u2019s Julian Borger on how US foreign policies have contributed to the troubles facing the Central American nations. The White House is making a further move to crack down on migrants reaching the US via the US-Mexico border. According to a new rule published in the Federal Register, asylum seekers who pass through another country first will be ineligible for asylum at the US southern border, the Associated Press has just reported. There was growing speculation about this earlier today, and so it has come to pass. The rule, expected to go into effect on Tuesday, also applies to children who have crossed the border alone. We\u2019ll have a lot more on this in a moment.... Good Morning, welcome to our daily live coverage of US politics. There\u2019s a lot going on today as lawmakers try to cram in as much scandal, argument, division and, possibly, even, legislation, with the summer recess looming. Happy Monday, what\u2019s coming up today? We need to figure out if Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids are actually happening, as they were promised to begin yesterday but don\u2019t appear to have and confusion and fear reign. Meanwhile, acting director of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service, Ken Cuccinelli, just called Donald Trump\u2019s racist tweets telling The Squad to \u201cgo home\u201d to where they came from \u201cpolitical hand grenades\u201d, but said they weren\u2019t racist. Author E Jean Carroll is considering suing Donald Trump over his alleged sexual assault on her in a Bergdorf Goodman changing room in the past. She had earlier said she was not going down the legal route, out of respect for migrants being raped and exploited at the US-Mexico border. Jeffrey Epstein, that old ally of the rich and powerful and convicted sex offender, is due back in court in New York today, at 10am ET, as he argues to be allowed to be on house arrest as his latest case proceeds.",
