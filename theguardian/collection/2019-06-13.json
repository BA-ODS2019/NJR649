      "bodyText": "Brazil\u2019s far-right president Jair Bolsonaro has sacked one of the most prominent moderates in his administration for reportedly failing to ideologically align himself with his commander-in-chief\u2019s radical creed. Gen Carlos Alberto dos Santos Cruz, Bolsonaro\u2019s secretary of government, had repeatedly locked horns with the president\u2019s crotchety US-based guru, Olavo de Carvalho, and was reportedly relieved of his duties on Thursday afternoon. The move, which sent shockwaves through Brazilian politics, came as Bolsonaro finally broke an almost four-day silence over a still unfolding scandal involving his justice minister S\u00e9rgio Moro. Moro is facing calls for his resignation after a series of politically explosive leaks published by the Intercept suggested he colluded with prosecutors in order to jail Bolsonaro\u2019s key rival in last year\u2019s presidential election, former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. Polls suggested Lula would have defeated Bolsonaro had he been able to run. Bolsonaro loyalists and Olavo de Carvalho devotees celebrated the defenestration of Santos Cruz, one of the key players in what is seen as a comparatively moderate military faction with the administration. \u201cSantos Cruz has been relieved of his duties. The drinks are on me,\u201d tweeted the Bolsonarian blogger Allan dos Santos. But political observers voiced shock and concern that one of the more temperate characters around Brazil\u2019s far-right leader had been forced out. Brian Winter, a Brazil specialist and the editor-in-chief of Americas Quarterly, said: \u201cIt is very sudden, it is very unexpected, and it comes at a time when the pragmatic voices seemed to be ascendant in the government. This is one of the most pragmatic voices in the government who can be fired.\u201d Winter said it was unclear whether Santos Cruz\u2019s demise was the result of a clash with the president, or friction with Bolsonaro\u2019s Olavo de Carvalho-supporting sons, Eduardo and Carlos, who have been \u201cbaying for his head publicly and behind the scenes\u201d for weeks. The Rio broadsheet O Globo said the sacking was the result of \u201ca lack of political and ideological alignment\u201d. Santos Cruz became embroiled in a public feud with Olavo de Carvalho in March, with the latter launching a succession of foul-mouthed and often infantile Twitter attacks. \u201cWatch your mouth, you shit,\u201d Carvalho tweeted at one point. On another occasion he branded Santos Cruz \u201ca pompous turd\u201d. Santos Cruz hit back more subtly, using one interview to warn of the danger \u201cextremism\u201d and \u201cfanaticism\u201d posed to Bolsonaro\u2019s government and Brazil. Santos Cruz\u2019s dismissal came shortly after Bolsonaro offered his backing to another key minister, S\u00e9rgio Moro, who has come under fire this week following the Intercept\u2019s revelations. \u201cWhat he did is priceless. He is part of Brazilian history,\u201d Bolsonaro said in reference to the sprawling Car Wash anti-corruption investigation for which Moro became famous. However, the Intercept\u2019s editors have vowed to release more compromising material from what they call a \u201cvast trove\u201d of secret documents, leaving Brazil\u2019s political class bracing for further turbulence.

In the evening there will be a wreath-laying at the base of the tower, a multi-faith vigil and a silent walk culminating in a roll call of those who died. The events take place in an atmosphere of rising anger at the slow pace of justice and continued risks posed by buildings using similar combustible materials to those which burned on Grenfell two years ago. The public inquiry has been delayed, decisions on criminal prosecutions are unlikely until 2021, the social housing regulator is yet to be replaced with a system giving more power to tenants and only 69 of the 334 privately-owned and social housing high-rises found to be wrapped in Grenfell-style cladding have been fixed. \u201c[People] are increasingly feeling a sense of injustice, rather than a walk to justice,\u201d said Yvette Williams, a co-ordinator of Justice4Grenfell, a campaign group. \u201cI think foremost in people\u2019s minds will be: 72 dead, still no arrests, how come?\u201d Karim Mussilhy, the vice chairman of Grenfell United, the survivors and bereaved group, said that as well as sharing tears, the purpose of the day was to \u201cbe a presence to everyone else, show them that we are still here and \u2026 we aren\u2019t going to go away\u201d. On Wednesday night, Grenfell United lit up three tower blocks in Salford, Newcastle and London with projections highlighting a nationwide fire safety crisis that appears to be getting worse rather than better. 12-storey-high messages warned they are still not fitted with sprinklers, feature defective fire doors or are wrapped in dangerous cladding. The message on NV Buildings in Salford read: \u201c2 years after Grenfell and this building is still covered in dangerous cladding. #DemandChange.\u201d A leaseholder, Peter Brown, said nearly 250 households faced a bill of almost \u00a33m to make their homes safe, and families and children feared for their safety because the building was wrapped in combustible expanded polystyrene insulation.

It also emerged on Thursday that MPs told ministers in 2014 not to dismiss warnings about the safety of combustible cladding panels and the need for sprinklers in case \u201ca major fire tragedy, with loss of life [should] occur\u201d. The chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on fire safety and rescue, David Amess MP, told Stephen Williams, then the communities minister, that he was \u201cat a loss to understand how you had concluded that credible and independent evidence which had life safety implications was not considered to be urgent\u201d, according to letters obtained by Inside Housing magazine. The MPs raised further concerns in 2016 and 2017 about the government\u2019s failure to review fire safety regulations following the 2009 Lakanal House fire in south London, which killed six people.",

The Rugby Football Union\u2019s new chief executive, Bill Sweeney, has also revealed Jones could still be in charge for the 2023 World Cup in France.</p> <p>It represents another shift in RFU policy after Jones\u2019s contract was extended through to 2021 by Sweeney\u2019s predecessor, Steve Brown, in January 2018 but with a break clause should England fail to reach the semi-finals in Japan. Sweeney, who took office in May, confirmed that there would be a review if England flop in Japan but he firmly expects Jones to stay, so much so that he has handed the defence coach John Mitchell a new contract until 2021 at the Australian\u2019s request.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/02/we-are-nowhere-near-our-best-eddie-jones-says-england-can-get-better\">\u2018We are nowhere near our best\u2019: Eddie Jones says England can get better</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jones has hinted in the past he may leave his role regardless of how England fare in Japan but Sweeney said: \u201cEddie is contracted to 2021. He said very clearly to me, \u2018I\u2019m committed to staying to \u201821, I\u2019m not looking to go anywhere else.\u2019 You can only take somebody at their word and he said he is committed to stay till 2021.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if Jones and Mitchell may stay until the 2023 tournament, Sweeney said: \u201cIt is possible. The focus now is really on the World Cup and then making sure we get our plans in place post-World Cup. Eddie has reconfirmed his commitment through to 2021. From that perspective we\u2019ve already started conversations around what will the coaching team be coming back from Japan. He has got a number of names in the frame.\u201d</p> <p>Brown had wanted to identify Jones\u2019s successor before this year\u2019s World Cup and his stated plan was to have the new head coach in place at the end of the 2019-20 season, claiming \u201cwe absolutely needed a succession process\u201d. The new head coach was supposed to lead a developmental England side on the 2020 summer tour of Japan with Jones taking a back seat. In effect it was a way of tying Jones down when his stock was at its highest \u2013 he had just been named coach of the year \u2013 before freeing him up to coach the British &amp; Irish Lions.</p> <p>Brown lasted just over a year, however, with Sweeney, who has been brought in to stem the union\u2019s financial losses, in effect ripping up that plan, claiming it would have been a distraction to make plans before this year\u2019s World Cup, despite France, Ireland, Wales and Italy doing so. \u201cI think any other speculation prior to that would be really disruptive to the situation.\u201d</p> <p>This is not the first time the RFU\u2019s succession plan has changed. When Jones was appointed by Ian Ritchie at the end of 2015, he said that \u201ca fundamental part of my job\u201d was to groom one of his assistants to take over. Paul Gustard has left however, and Steve Borthwick \u2013 though a valued RFU employee \u2013 is not head coach material.</p> <p>That left Brown eager to extend Jones\u2019s contract, with the obvious caveat of a break clause, while Nigel Melville, who filled in on a temporary basis until Sweeney\u2019s arrival, had claimed the union was drawing up two lists of candidates to take the job either immediately after the World Cup, or in 2021, depending on England\u2019s performance in Japan.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Eddie Jones is poised to continue as England\u2019s head coach until at least 2021 even if his side fail to achieve their target at the World Cup in Japan this year. The Rugby Football Union\u2019s new chief executive, Bill Sweeney, has also revealed Jones could still be in charge for the 2023 World Cup in France. It represents another shift in RFU policy after Jones\u2019s contract was extended through to 2021 by Sweeney\u2019s predecessor, Steve Brown, in January 2018 but with a break clause should England fail to reach the semi-finals in Japan. Sweeney, who took office in May, confirmed that there would be a review if England flop in Japan but he firmly expects Jones to stay, so much so that he has handed the defence coach John Mitchell a new contract until 2021 at the Australian\u2019s request. Jones has hinted in the past he may leave his role regardless of how England fare in Japan but Sweeney said: \u201cEddie is contracted to 2021. He said very clearly to me, \u2018I\u2019m committed to staying to \u201821, I\u2019m not looking to go anywhere else.\u2019 You can only take somebody at their word and he said he is committed to stay till 2021.\u201d Asked if Jones and Mitchell may stay until the 2023 tournament, Sweeney said: \u201cIt is possible. The focus now is really on the World Cup and then making sure we get our plans in place post-World Cup. Eddie has reconfirmed his commitment through to 2021. From that perspective we\u2019ve already started conversations around what will the coaching team be coming back from Japan. He has got a number of names in the frame.\u201d Brown had wanted to identify Jones\u2019s successor before this year\u2019s World Cup and his stated plan was to have the new head coach in place at the end of the 2019-20 season, claiming \u201cwe absolutely needed a succession process\u201d. The new head coach was supposed to lead a developmental England side on the 2020 summer tour of Japan with Jones taking a back seat. In effect it was a way of tying Jones down when his stock was at its highest \u2013 he had just been named coach of the year \u2013 before freeing him up to coach the British &amp; Irish Lions. Brown lasted just over a year, however, with Sweeney, who has been brought in to stem the union\u2019s financial losses, in effect ripping up that plan, claiming it would have been a distraction to make plans before this year\u2019s World Cup, despite France, Ireland, Wales and Italy doing so. \u201cI think any other speculation prior to that would be really disruptive to the situation.\u201d This is not the first time the RFU\u2019s succession plan has changed. When Jones was appointed by Ian Ritchie at the end of 2015, he said that \u201ca fundamental part of my job\u201d was to groom one of his assistants to take over. Paul Gustard has left however, and Steve Borthwick \u2013 though a valued RFU employee \u2013 is not head coach material. That left Brown eager to extend Jones\u2019s contract, with the obvious caveat of a break clause, while Nigel Melville, who filled in on a temporary basis until Sweeney\u2019s arrival, had claimed the union was drawing up two lists of candidates to take the job either immediately after the World Cup, or in 2021, depending on England\u2019s performance in Japan.",

Trump first announced her departure via Twitter then spoke of her in glowing terms at an unrelated event at the White House. He described Sanders as \u201ca magnificent person\u201d and who has done \u201can incredible job\u201d.</p> \n<p>Sanders promised that she would continue to be \u201cone of the most outspoken and loyal supporters of the president and his agenda\u201d \u2013 raising the prospect that she could follow her predecessor, Sean Spicer, into becoming a political pundit on channels such as Fox News. \u201cI know he\u2019s going to have an incredible six more years,\u201d she added.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"21c01f92-0dc6-4559-b734-070c881ed0b0\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dMwJaIq5Tss?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Sanders will not be missed by Trump\u2019s critics. Matthew Miller, a former justice department spokesperson, tweeted: \u201cGood riddance. She had the most important spokesperson job in the world and used it to lie repeatedly to the American people. I hope shame and stigma follow her the rest of life.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sanders, daughter of former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, took over from Spicer in July 2017. She was the third woman to hold the position. She was one of the closest and most trusted White House aides and one of the few remaining who worked on his campaign.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Good riddance.

In January she told the Christian TV network CBN that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2019/01/30/sarah-sanders-tells-christian-broadcasting-network-god-wanted-trump-be-president/?utm_term=.c53296cecd62\">God wanted Donald Trump to become president</a>\u201d.</p> \n<p>Sanders amplified Trump\u2019s attacks on the media, sometimes clashing with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/25/jim-acosta-cnn-white-house-trump-book-enemy-of-the-people\">CNN correspondent Jim Acosta</a> in the briefing room, and notoriously made false claims on behalf of the president, deepening questions about the administration\u2019s credibility.</p> \n<p>Special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report revealed that Sanders admitted to investigators that she had made an unfounded claim that \u201ccountless\u201d FBI agents had got in touch to express support for Trump\u2019s decision to fire FBI director James Comey in May 2017. Sanders later claimed her comments were \u201ca slip of the tongue\u201d and made in \u201cthe heat of the moment\u201d.</p> \n<p>It was also on her watch that the daily press briefing, a staple of past administrations, became irregular and all but petered out. There has been no briefing for the past three months, effectively replaced by impromptu gatherings with reporters in the White House driveway, and by Trump\u2019s own question-and-answer sessions on the South Lawn.</p> \n<p>Sanders becomes the latest in a long list of White House departures; Trump has presided over a record turnover of staff. He has not yet announced a successor.</p> \n<p>At the press conference on Thursday, Trump summoned Sanders to join him at podium. The 36-year-old beamed as he said: \u201cShe\u2019s going to be leaving the service of her country and she\u2019s going to be going \u2013 I guess you could say private sector \u2026 She comes from a great state, Arkansas, that was a state that I won by a lot, so I like it.\u201d</p> \n<p> Trump added: \u201cIf we can get her to run for the governor of Arkansas, I think she\u2019ll do very well. I\u2019m trying to get her to do that \u2026 She\u2019s a very special person, a very, very fine woman, she has been so great, she has such heart, she\u2019s strong but with great, great heart, and I want to thank you for an outstanding job.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump kissed Sanders on the head amid applause. She took the podium, visibly resisting tears, and said: \u201cThis has been the honour of a lifetime, the opportunity of a lifetime.</p> \n<p>She said she had \u201cloved every minute, even in the hard minutes, I\u2019ve loved it.</p> \n<p>\u201cI love the president. I love the team that I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work for.

      "bodyText": "Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, has become the latest official to leave Donald Trump\u2019s volatile administration, but in an emotional farewell she insisted: \u201cI love the president.\u201d Sanders, a bitterly divisive figure who has not held a press briefing for a record 94 days, will return to her home state of Arkansas, it was announced on Thursday, though her exact plans remain unclear. The president and Sanders expressed mutual admiration that suggested the parting was amicable. Trump first announced her departure via Twitter then spoke of her in glowing terms at an unrelated event at the White House. He described Sanders as \u201ca magnificent person\u201d and who has done \u201can incredible job\u201d. Sanders promised that she would continue to be \u201cone of the most outspoken and loyal supporters of the president and his agenda\u201d \u2013 raising the prospect that she could follow her predecessor, Sean Spicer, into becoming a political pundit on channels such as Fox News. \u201cI know he\u2019s going to have an incredible six more years,\u201d she added. Sanders will not be missed by Trump\u2019s critics. Matthew Miller, a former justice department spokesperson, tweeted: \u201cGood riddance. She had the most important spokesperson job in the world and used it to lie repeatedly to the American people. I hope shame and stigma follow her the rest of life.\u201d Sanders, daughter of former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, took over from Spicer in July 2017. She was the third woman to hold the position. She was one of the closest and most trusted White House aides and one of the few remaining who worked on his campaign. Sanders provided stability after Spicer\u2019s series of wayward gaffes and, unlike other Trump officials, stayed in his good graces with her unswerving, often ostentatious shows of loyalty. In January she told the Christian TV network CBN that \u201cGod wanted Donald Trump to become president\u201d. Sanders amplified Trump\u2019s attacks on the media, sometimes clashing with CNN correspondent Jim Acosta in the briefing room, and notoriously made false claims on behalf of the president, deepening questions about the administration\u2019s credibility. Special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report revealed that Sanders admitted to investigators that she had made an unfounded claim that \u201ccountless\u201d FBI agents had got in touch to express support for Trump\u2019s decision to fire FBI director James Comey in May 2017. Sanders later claimed her comments were \u201ca slip of the tongue\u201d and made in \u201cthe heat of the moment\u201d. It was also on her watch that the daily press briefing, a staple of past administrations, became irregular and all but petered out. There has been no briefing for the past three months, effectively replaced by impromptu gatherings with reporters in the White House driveway, and by Trump\u2019s own question-and-answer sessions on the South Lawn. Sanders becomes the latest in a long list of White House departures; Trump has presided over a record turnover of staff. He has not yet announced a successor. At the press conference on Thursday, Trump summoned Sanders to join him at podium. The 36-year-old beamed as he said: \u201cShe\u2019s going to be leaving the service of her country and she\u2019s going to be going \u2013 I guess you could say private sector \u2026 She comes from a great state, Arkansas, that was a state that I won by a lot, so I like it.\u201d Trump added: \u201cIf we can get her to run for the governor of Arkansas, I think she\u2019ll do very well. I\u2019m trying to get her to do that \u2026 She\u2019s a very special person, a very, very fine woman, she has been so great, she has such heart, she\u2019s strong but with great, great heart, and I want to thank you for an outstanding job.\u201d Trump kissed Sanders on the head amid applause. She took the podium, visibly resisting tears, and said: \u201cThis has been the honour of a lifetime, the opportunity of a lifetime. She said she had \u201cloved every minute, even in the hard minutes, I\u2019ve loved it. \u201cI love the president. I love the team that I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work for. The president is surrounded by some of the most incredible and most talented people you could ever imagine and it\u2019s truly the most special experience. The only one I can think of that might top it just a little bit is the fact that I\u2019m a mom. I have three amazing kids and I\u2019m going to spend a little more time with them.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "At St George\u2019s Park, where England\u2019s Under-21s have spent the past three weeks preparing for the European Championship, Aidy Boothroyd is talking world domination. Hubris and England head coaches often make an uncomfortable pairing but Boothroyd is outlining an aspiration of the Football Association. On display nearby are the Under-17 and Under-20 World Cups. The aspiration has substance, and the Under-21s aim to add another layer over the next fortnight in Italy and San Marino. England won the two World Cups in 2017, the year Boothroyd and his Under-21s suffered the agony of a penalty shootout defeat by Germany in the Euro semi-finals. The head coach remains determined to increase the trophy collection at St George\u2019s Park and to do so in a style that England fans can identify at every age level. \u201cI daydream a lot [of adding to the World Cup successes] but they\u2019ve gone really,\u201d says the former Watford manager, who has been part of the England set-up since 2014. \u201cI am very much thinking about the next one rather than wallowing in what has gone on before but, yes, that would be lovely. That is what we are aiming to do, but you need a vision of where you want to get to and that is having a legacy in English football of winning things over a period of decades. \u201cWe want to be thought of as the leading team in the world and to do that you have got to be winning consistently. I think there is also a bigger picture for us in the way we want all our teams to play. The average guy or girl who watches football wants to win, but they want their team to play in a way that is attractive and entertains them. That is the world we live in and that is what we try to do.\u201d England have not won the Euro at Under-21 level since 1984. Their latest pursuit of a third title \u2013 Italy have won it five times and Spain four \u2013 starts on Tuesday against France in Cesena.

We need new ones to shine. Now we are expected to do well and I am not afraid of that. It would be lovely to have world domination but I think we have always got to be striving for it. There will be ups and downs. There always are.\u201d Only three players remain in Boothroyd\u2019s squad from England\u2019s last shot at the Euros in 2017 \u2013 Tammy Abraham, Demarai Gray and Angus Gunn \u2013 but several of the group could have been considered for senior duty in the Nations League.

They are favourites on paper to win today, but will need to be wary against an attacking South Africa side who threatened to shock Spain in their opener.</p> <p>Want additional subplots? Well, two South Africans - Thembi Kgatlana and Linda Motlhalo - both play their club football in China at Beijing Phoenix, while PSG\u2019s Wang Shuang will be especially keen to make an impact in Paris.</p> <p>With 16 of the 24 teams progressing to the knockout stages, but these two sides stuck on zero points, it\u2019s likely the winner here will get through, and the loser will go home.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me, but we\u2019ll have a full match report online shortly. Thanks for joining me, and goodnight. Three games to take in tomorrow, with Japan v Scotland at 2pm (BST), Jamaica v Italy at 5pm and England v Argentina at 8pm. We\u2019re almost a third of the way through the tournament already. Does time ever go faster than during a World Cup? China\u2019s victory means they join Spain on three points in Group B. Their meeting on Monday will decide second place, unless South Africa can claim an astonishing upset against Germany. That\u2019s also the only scenario that can get the African side off the bottom of the group. Even then, a draw in the other game would see them go home regardless. The Beeb\u2019s red-button feed has made a sharp exit, so here\u2019s The Latest From The England Camp. Li Ying\u2019s first half goal proves enough for China to overcome determined opponents who threatened early in the second half, but couldn\u2019t find an equaliser. 92 mins: It\u2019s China who look the more likely to score, with Swart climbing to collect a cross ahead of Wang Shuang. Two more minutes to play. 90 mins: So nearly a second here, as Yang Li gets onto Lou\u2019s pass across goal. She\u2019s just onside, and has time to pick her spot - but Swart makes another fine save! 89 mins: South Africa appear to have run out of gas. It\u2019s worth noting that several of their players don\u2019t even have professional contracts. They\u2019ve pushed a World Cup heavyweight hard here. 87 mins: Time running out for South Africa to avoid a heroic narrow defeat, and almost certain elimination. 85 mins: The free kick bounces dangerously across the area, ending up on the roof of the net. The corner is nodded down at the far post by Han Peng - but Swart springs to her left to save! 82 mins: First yellow card of the game, which is somewhat surprising. It\u2019s dished out to Matlou, for hauling Lou Jiahui down. Linda Motlhalo comes on for Refiloe Jane. 81 mins: Final change for China. Yang Li replaces the goalscorer, Li Ying. 79 mins: Plenty of noise around the Parc des Princes now, both sets of fans encouraging their teams forward. 76 mins: South Africa appeal for a penalty! Kgatlana pounces after China fail to clear, and her shot is blocked by Lin. It looked close to hitting her upper arm, but the referee waves play on. Rightly so, as the ball actually hit her chest. 75 mins: Wang Shuang gets onto the ball inside the area, but her attempted pass is cut out. 15 minutes for China to hold on, as Yao Wei comes on for Wang Yan. 72 mins: Second South Africa change, as the hugely experienced Leandra Smeda replaces Holweni. 71 mins: China appear to have cleared their heads, with Lou the latest player in red to push forward, cutting inside with a shimmy before Matlou denies her with a block. 69 mins: China try to keep the ball upfield, before Yang Shanshan fires over from a distance. Perhaps she didn\u2019t get the memo. 67 mins: South Africa have fought their way back into this, after escaping from the first half one goal down. Kgatlana is caught offside as she moved to race onto a pass. 64 mins: Gu Yasha comes off, replaced by the more defensive-minded Lou Jiahui. Yasha was probably the standout player in the first half. 63 mins: A first shot on target for South Africa, as Biyana lets fly from the edge of the area. Peng watches it all the way, and holds comfortably. 61 mins: First change of the game, as Jermaine Seoposenwe replaces Fulutudilu. A speedy striker, Seoposenwe plays her club football in - you guessed it! - Lithuania. 59 mins: A couple of corners in a row for South Africa, but nothing comes of them. China break and Wang Shuang, playing further forward in this half, swings in a cross that\u2019s over everyone\u2019s heads. 57 mins: Kgatlana causes panic in the China defence again, racing down the left and winning a corner off Lin. 56 mins: China are inviting their opponents back into the game. A hurried clearance concedes a corner, from which a deflected header squirms wide. 54 mins: The ball bobbles into the path of Makhabane, who fires a decent effort over from 20 yards. 50 mins: Kgatlana has been South Africa\u2019s biggest threat by a distance - and she almost gets in behind the defence here, forcing Liu to chase her down. The left-back takes a swing and misses the ball, but also her opponent, who goes to ground theatrically. 48 mins: Desiree Ellis will have to make an attacking change soon. South Africa\u2019s sole striker, Ole Fulutudilu, is ploughing a furrow that\u2019s lone in the extreme. 47 mins: Van Wyk takes the ball from Li, who was threatening to burst into the penalty area. No changes for either team. Catch up on the day\u2019s early game, which was a cracker: If it stays like this - or if China add to their lead - then Germany are going through. They have six points, so can\u2019t be caught by both China and Spain, who meet in the last group game. They weren\u2019t really in any danger of going out anyway, tbh. \u201cRe: the \u2018unnecessary countdown\u2019 (see kick-off),\u201d writes James Ferro. \u201cI thought the same, but my wife pointed out that there are a lot of families with young children, who may enjoy it as part of the overall occasion.\u201d I feel bad now. China deservedly lead through Li Ying\u2019s fine finish, and it could have been more. Can South Africa fight back? We\u2019ll find out soon enough. 44 mins: Another Gu cross picks out Wang Shanshan, whose header flies wide. South Africa need the chance to regroup - there\u2019ll be two added minutes. 42 mins: China are so close to a second! Wang Shanshan meets a corner unopposed and sends her header onto the underside of the bar. Replays show about an inch of the ball wasn\u2019t behind the line. \u201cAm I wrong to think the Chinese coach is a graduate of The Man City School of Early Fouling?\u201d asks Scott Bassett. \u201cEvery time South Africa get on the ball there\u2019s a shove, push, shirt pull or all of the above.\u201d 39 mins: It\u2019s the tried and tested route that pays off, with a deep cross from Zhang picking out Li, who gets ahead of Matlou and prods the ball beyond Swart. That\u2019s a terrific finish. China make the breakthrough! 38 mins: Wang Shuang, back in the team after being dropped against Germany, dances into the penalty area but Matlou holds her up and clears the danger. 36 mins: Kgatlana tries another breakaway, and it takes three or four nervous defenders to stop her before she can pick out a teammate. 34 mins: South Africa will be very happy to hear the half-time whistle. Wang Shanshan goes close this time, controlling smartly only for her close-range shot to be deflected over. 32 mins: The chances are starting to flow more freely for China. First, Wang Shuang fires over from 20 yards. Then, Gu cuts inside and Van Wyk\u2019s slip leaves her with a clear sight of goal - but she scuffs her shot wide! 30 mins: Thembi Kgatlana is rapid. From the clearance upfield, she gets beyond her marker with ease, and fires a shot into the side netting from a tight angle. 29 mins: Gu Yasha lifts in another tempting cross but it\u2019s just too high for Wang Shanshan. From the corner, Gu has a go from 25 yards that flies over the bar. 28 mins: It\u2019s all very tentative out there. South Africa are trying to settle into the game, while China don\u2019t want to give them any chance on the break. 25 mins: South Africa get a free kick in their own half after Wang Shuang barges into Makhabane. 23 mins: A slip in the Chinese defence finally allows Kgatlana to show her stuff, racing down the right flank and cutting inside her marker - but her cut-back is undercooked. 20 mins: Another testing cross from Liu Shanshan finds the head of Li, but her header is off target. China looking far the likelier here. 18 mins: China sweep upfield but Li is caught offside as she races in down the left. 16 mins: South Africa can\u2019t make any ground further up the field, with China putting in no-nonsense challenges every time they threaten to get forward. 14 mins: Biyana is back, and the game has slowed down after China\u2019s early chances. 12 mins: There\u2019s been a break in play while Biyana, the teenage midfielder, gets treatment after a hefty challenge. 9 mins: Wang Shuang fires in a corner that Wang Shanshan heads over from six yards out. That was a decent chance. 7 mins: South Africa have set up as they did against Spain, sitting deep and hoping to break. Winger Refiloe Jane finds space down the left, but is quickly closed down. 5 mins: China win a corner which they play short, allowing left-back Liu to whip in a testing cross. Kaylin Swart does well to punch clear under pressure. 3 mins: Gu Yasha - who scored when these teams met at the last Olympics - almost picks out Li Ying with a cross, but Swart is off her line to collect. 1 min: China make an immediate surge forward, with Van Wyk clearing a low cross. China right-back Wang Yan takes a knock to the head, and requires treatment. After that thoroughly unnecessary countdown from the PA, we\u2019re under way. South Africa are in yellow shirts and dark green shorts, China all in red. Anthems being played in Paris, with the kick-off moments away. Germany and France will have an eye on this one - either could secure their place in the knockouts, depending on the result. Here\u2019s Richard Parkin\u2019s match report from Montpellier, where Australia fought back from 2-0 down with a helping hand from you-know-what. Alex Morgan\u2019s five goals in that game put her top of the Golden Boot standings, but Brazil\u2019s Cristiane is catching up after getting her fourth of the tournament against Australia. Cold comfort perhaps, given they went on to lose. The USA\u2019s 13-0 win over Thailand continues to divide opinion. Eni Aluko says it would be disrespectful to stop celebrating: While Hope Solo wishes her former teammates had toned it down a bit: Get better acquainted with these two teams with our Experts\u2019 Network guides: South Africa (4-5-1): Swart; Ramalepe, Van Wyk, Matlou, Holweni; Kgatlana, Makhabane, Mbane, Biyana, Jane; Fulutudilu. Subs: Mpuru, Diamini, Vilakazi, Dhlamini, Mthandi, Motlhalo, Seoposenwe, Makhubela, Smeda, Gamede, Ndimeni, Mulaudzi. China (5-3-2): Peng Shimeng; Wang Yan, Lin Yuping, Han Peng, Wu Hiayan, Liu Shanshan; Wang Shuang, Zhang Rui, Gu Yasha; Wang Shanshan, Li Ying. Subs: Xu Huan, Bi Xiaolin, Lou Jiahui, Li Jiayue, Yang Li, Wang Ying, Song Duan, Li Wen, Tan Ruyin, Yao Wei, Luo Guiping, Liu Yanqiu. For the tournament\u2019s Asian sides, this World Cup has not exactly gone to plan so far. South Korea have played two and lost two, while Japan were held to a goalless draw by Argentina. Australia were upset by Italy (before fighting back to beat Brazil), and then there\u2019s Thailand. China made a more positive start than most, giving Germany a few frights on their way to a 1-0 defeat. They are favourites on paper to win today, but will need to be wary against an attacking South Africa side who threatened to shock Spain in their opener. Want additional subplots? Well, two South Africans - Thembi Kgatlana and Linda Motlhalo - both play their club football in China at Beijing Phoenix, while PSG\u2019s Wang Shuang will be especially keen to make an impact in Paris. With 16 of the 24 teams progressing to the knockout stages, but these two sides stuck on zero points, it\u2019s likely the winner here will get through, and the loser will go home. Kick off is at 8pm BST.",

When the Black and Whites have been bad this season, they have been abysmal: with four defeats by 30 points or more already in 2019. At half-time here, the prospect of a fifth was not entirely impossible, either.</p> <p>But when this Hull side click, they are a match for anyone - and having trailed 14-4 at half-time, to eventually win by the margin they did here at Castleford tells you all you need to know about their title credentials this season. \u201cOur season is being remembered for those four losses - but maybe we\u2019ve got some big wins to come,\u201d their coach, Lee Radford, said afterwards.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/11/luther-burrell-switch-rugby-union-super-league-warrington-wolves\">Warrington switch from union may start a trend, says Luther Burrell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hull are now third following this comeback victory at fifth-placed Castleford, with a six-point cushion over the sides outside the play-off places to boot. Nothing is decided in June, but what is guaranteed is that this side, with such an array of talent, are clearly capable of lasting the distance between now and October.</p> <p>First-half tries from Greg Minikin and Junior Moors, coupled with three goals from Peter Mata\u2019utia, had put the Tigers on course to leapfrog Hull into third themselves here at half-time. Hull had struggled to cope with the miserable conditions in West Yorkshire during that half, with Ratu Naulago\u2019s try all they could muster.</p> <p>How they emerged a different team after half-time, though. Within ten minutes they were ahead thanks to Naulago\u2019s second and a wonderful breakaway try from Albert Kelly: both of which were assisted by Jake Connor. The England international\u2019s night was far from over too; having laid Naulago\u2019s first on a plate, he did the same for Kelly soon after for his second.</p> <p>That came after Greg Eden temporarily levelled the scores at 18-18, but even then, it was clear Hull were in the ascendancy.

      "bodyText": "Rarely can one performance sum up an entire season, but this is about as close to perfection in that regard as you will find from Hull FC. When the Black and Whites have been bad this season, they have been abysmal: with four defeats by 30 points or more already in 2019. At half-time here, the prospect of a fifth was not entirely impossible, either. But when this Hull side click, they are a match for anyone - and having trailed 14-4 at half-time, to eventually win by the margin they did here at Castleford tells you all you need to know about their title credentials this season. \u201cOur season is being remembered for those four losses - but maybe we\u2019ve got some big wins to come,\u201d their coach, Lee Radford, said afterwards. Hull are now third following this comeback victory at fifth-placed Castleford, with a six-point cushion over the sides outside the play-off places to boot. Nothing is decided in June, but what is guaranteed is that this side, with such an array of talent, are clearly capable of lasting the distance between now and October. First-half tries from Greg Minikin and Junior Moors, coupled with three goals from Peter Mata\u2019utia, had put the Tigers on course to leapfrog Hull into third themselves here at half-time. Hull had struggled to cope with the miserable conditions in West Yorkshire during that half, with Ratu Naulago\u2019s try all they could muster. How they emerged a different team after half-time, though. Within ten minutes they were ahead thanks to Naulago\u2019s second and a wonderful breakaway try from Albert Kelly: both of which were assisted by Jake Connor. The England international\u2019s night was far from over too; having laid Naulago\u2019s first on a plate, he did the same for Kelly soon after for his second. That came after Greg Eden temporarily levelled the scores at 18-18, but even then, it was clear Hull were in the ascendancy. Kelly\u2019s try made it 24-18, before the half-back completed a wonderful hat-trick with another breakaway try. \u201cThere\u2019s still plenty to go, but I\u2019m going to enjoy this,\u201d was Radford\u2019s closing remark.

      "bodyText": "Human rights groups have expressed outrage after a former Argentinian army officer accused of committing murder and forced disappearances during the 1976-83 military dictatorship was found enjoying a beach holiday in Sicily. Reporters from la Repubblica discovered Lt Colonel Carlos Luis Malatto in a tourist village in the province of Messina, even though he is currently on trial in Rome for crimes committed in Argentina, which is also seeking his extradition. A video posted on the newspaper\u2019s website shows Malatto refusing to answer questions when he was confronted by reporters. Prosecutors in Argentina have offered a 500,000 peso (\u00a310,000) reward for the capture of Malatto, who is accused of five counts of crimes against humanity. Writing to the court of appeal in the Argentinian state of Mendoza, prosecutors alleged that Malatto \u201cactively participated in various detention procedures and is one of the most infamous perpetrators\u201d of the dictatorship \u201cfor his participation in interrogations under torture\u201d. Malatto fled Argentina and arrived in Italy in 2011, but in 2014 Rome refused Argentina\u2019s request to extradite him. The following year, Italy\u2019s justice ministry approved his trial in Rome for the murders of Marie Anne Erize, a French-Argentinian model; Juan Carlos C\u00e1mpora, the rector of the University of San Juan; Angel Jos\u00e9 Alberto Carvajal, a communist party official, and Jorge Bonil, a soldier. However Italian judges refused to put him under house arrest, leaving him free to travel \u2013 and take beach holidays. \u201cWe asked the Italian judiciary to at least monitor Malatto\u2019s movements, said Jorge Ithurburu, attorney for the Rome-based non-governmental organisation 24 Marzo. \u201cWe fear that Malatto may escape justice. It is sad that Italy is still today a refuge for torturers.\u2019\u2019 After the 1976 coup, Argentina\u2019s military set about systematically crushing any potential opposition, and eventually murdered some 30,000 people \u2013 almost all of them unarmed non-combatants. Pregnant prisoners were kept alive just until they gave birth; some 500 babies are believed to have been given to childless military couples to raise as their own. In 1985, barely two years after the country returned to democracy, coup leader Jorge Videla was convicted of human rights abuses and crimes against humanity. Since then, more than 1,000 other former officers have been sentenced for the torture and extrajudicial murder of activists and political opponents and their families. But many former officers continue to live in hiding in Europe, especially in Italy where many Argentinians have family ties. Malatto\u2019s family originally hailed from Abruzzo and he holds an Italian passport. Meanwhile, relatives of the military junta\u2019s victims are still fighting for justice: on Thursday the human rights organisation Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo announced that they had identified the 130th victim who was taken from his mother during the dictatorship. The group said that Javier Mat\u00edas Darroux Mijalchukis was a four-month old baby when he was kidnapped with his mother Elena Mijalchuk, days after his father Juan Manuel Darroux vanished. Both parents were forcibly disappeared. Next month, a court in Rome is due to give the final verdict in the trial of 24 men for their involvement in Operation Condor, a secret programme in which the dictatorships of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, Chile, Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador conspired to kidnap and assassinate opponents in each other\u2019s territories. The trial focused on the disappearance of 23 Italian nationals during the 70s and 80s. But activists warn that many of the perpetrators are growing old and may never be brought to justice. \u201cWe must act quickly,\u201d said Ithurburu, \u201cbecause the more time passes the more the witnesses of those atrocious crimes age or die\u2019\u2019.",

But anyone with an allegiance to the South American team will argue otherwise.</p>\n    <p>The unofficial Women\u2019s World Cup which took place in Mexico in 1971 also featured a match involving the two teams and it is remembered fondly in Argentina. They inflicted a 4-1 defeat on England, who lost all of their three games, two of which were played within 24 hours of each other.</p>\n    <p>Leah Caleb was 13 when taken out of school to represent England at the tournament and remembers how brutal the match against Argentina was. \u201cWe had eight injuries after the game,\u201d she says. \u201cTwo people went to hospital and came back in plasters and others had injections. It was hard football.\u201d</p>\n    <p>Chris Lockwood, 15 at the time, also clearly recalls Argentina\u2019s style. \u201cThere was a lot of gamesmanship that we\u2019d never come across before,\u201d she says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know how to avoid it \u2013 we\u2019d only ever played honest football. They\u2019re always talking about it in Argentina and how they beat England in 1971. They\u2019ve been trying to get it recognised; they never shut up about it.\u201d</p>\n    <p>The desire to have their result against England recognised is perhaps because of the struggle women\u2019s football has faced in the country since. Argentina qualified for the 2003 and 2007 World Cup tournaments but were thrashed on several occasions, including an 11-0 defeat by Germany and a 6-1 loss against England in 2007 which Fifa considers their only previous clash.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Jill Scott was the only player in the current Lionesses squad who featured in that game, with Karen Carney and Carly Telford unused substitutes. Scott got the second goal after Argentina\u2019s Eva Nadia Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s own goal had opened the scoring.&nbsp;<b>Kathryn Batte</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you can underestimate anyone in this World Cup, a lot of games almost turn into cup finals.

      "body": "<p>On Monday night, NBA fans around the world tuned in to what should have been a story of triumph. Here\u2019s how it might have played out: 3-1 down in the NBA finals and facing elimination, Kevin Durant battles through injury with superhuman perseverance to propel the Golden State Warriors to victory. It goes down as one of the greatest performances in NBA finals history.</p> <p>People love this type of storyline. Isiah Thomas scoring 25 points in the third quarter of Game 6 of the 1988 NBA finals <a href=\"https://www.nba.com/top-nba-finals-moments-isiah-thomas-game-6-ankle-1988-finals\">while hobbling on one foot</a> for the Detroit Pistons. Or Willis Reed walking out of the tunnel for the New York Knicks <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=5170973\">on his bum ankle</a> in Game 7 in 1970. The wounded hero persevering through pain. Everything was aligned for Durant to be added to that list.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/12/kevin-durant-achilles-injury-nba-finals\">Warriors' Kevin Durant undergoes surgery for ruptured achilles tendon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>High school, college and professional coaches across the country were salivating at the thought of using Durant to show their players that \u201cpain is weakness leaving your body\u201d. They would have used KD as an example to young athletes that the game, not your health, is what matters most.</p> <p>I\u2019ve seen it all before. Throughout my playing career, I saw teammates told to play through pain or discomfort only to go down with more severe injuries shortly afterwards. Jarvis Hayes told me the medical team said he simply had a case of tendinitis in his knee. Turned out he had a broken kneecap that ruined his entire career. Kwame Brown told me they said he was told to play through the discomfort in his leg to show everyone he was worthy of being the No 1 overall pick in the 2000 draft. Turned out it was a torn hamstring. I saw Richard Hamilton go off on the training staff after he learned he\u2019d been playing through a torn groin only disclosed to him after the team was out of playoff contention. Deshawn Stevenson told me a trainer said there was nothing seriously wrong with his back that ice and stim couldn\u2019t fix. After the season, it was discovered he in fact had an inflamed L5 nerve that was stuck underneath a disc, requiring not one but two back surgeries to repair.</p> <p>None of this is hearsay, but instances I witnessed first-hand and verified with my former teammates over the past week. My point in bringing it up now is not to put the medical staff on blast, but illustrate a worrying fact: This happens all the time in professional sports.</p> <p>Why? Because team doctors and trainers have a conflict of interest: they are hired by the teams and are in essence employees of the organization rather than the players. By definition they are looking out for what benefits the team rather than the welfare of the individual athlete.</p> <p>The Warriors\u2019 medical staff appears to have <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/06/11/kevin-durant-paid-price-playing-hurt-robert-griffin-iii-can-feel-his-pain\">RG3\u2019d</a> Durant, who now faces a lengthy recovery after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/12/kevin-durant-achilles-injury-nba-finals\">undergoing surgery on Wednesday</a> for a torn achilles. He should not have been playing, period. Thomas and Reed shouldn\u2019t have been playing, either. The risks outweighed the rewards, even from a team standpoint. Durant is a franchise player. A player with the capability of single-handedly turning an entire NBA finals around. A player the Warriors should do everything in their power to convince they are worth re-signing with. Instead, they showed the exact opposite. It doesn\u2019t matter if Durant insisted on playing, the team should have had the medical integrity to tell him no. But the Warriors are not the only guilty party here. Other teams do similar things all the time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5ace0166a37be197e4006d0bc44cd235beb86161\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ace0166a37be197e4006d0bc44cd235beb86161/0_0_960_814/500.jpg\" alt=\"Kevin Durant and Etan Thomas\" width=\"500\" height=\"424\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The author and Kevin Durant celebrate during their time with the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I hope all young players see what happened with Durant and learn that no matter what the circumstances or how big the game is, health always comes first. Athletes should always get a second opinion from their own doctors, ones who are unaffiliated with their teams.</p> <p>If Durant \u2013 and other athletes \u2013 want an example of how to handle injuries, they only need to look at a man who has dominated this year\u2019s playoffs: Kawhi Leonard. Leonard weathered unfair criticism from pundits, coaches, teammates and fans last season when he was with the San Antonio Spurs because he chose to sit out most of the season with an ankle injury. The Spurs\u2019 team doctors <a href=\"https://nba.nbcsports.com/2018/03/13/kawhi-leonard-needs-to-be-cleared-by-his-medical-team-not-spurs-docs-to-return-to-court/\">said he was fine</a>. But Leonard got a second opinion from his own medical staff, did what was in his best interest and recovered to flourish with Toronto this season. His teammate Danny Green <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/former-spurs-guard-danny-green-didnt-know-he-was-playing-through-a-torn-groin-last-season/\">reportedly played through a torn groin last year</a> under the watch of the same doctors that misdiagnosed Kawhi.</p> <p>And bear in mind the Spurs are one of the most respected organizations in the NBA, with one of the league\u2019s most respected coaches. The bottom line is that <em>any</em> team will throw an injured player into action if they feel it is best for the organization. Teams will publicly criticize athletes if they don\u2019t play. And if they <em>do</em> play and re-injure themselves, or just don\u2019t play up to expectations, they can be expect to be brushed aside quickly.</p> <p>I remember watching Grant Hill during the late 1990s as he was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUPCeB3X-pg\">poised to take over the league</a>, averaging 21.6 points per game during his first six seasons with the Detroit Pistons and drawing comparisons to Michael Jordan. When he suffered an ankle injury a week before the 2000 playoffs, he was called out for not playing through it. People openly questioned how serious it was and accused him of being soft, just like they were saying about Durant in these playoffs. Hill rushed back from injury and was never the same player, years later saying the Pistons\u2019 medical staff <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/grant-hill-thinks-misdiagnosis-destroyed-ankle-career-150020333.html\">derailed his entire career</a>.</p> <p>Another example is the young Isaiah Thomas, who claims the Boston Celtics\u2019 team doctors <a href=\"https://weei.radio.com/blogs/alex-reimer/isaiah-thomas-accuses-celtics-misleading-him-about-hip-injury\">gave him misleading information regarding a hip injury</a> suffered ahead of the 2017 playoffs. He played in the postseason despite the injury (and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/apr/16/isaiah-thomas-sister-killed-car-accident-chyna-thomas\">death of his sister</a>), but wound up reaggravating the injury during the Eastern Conference finals. The Celtics traded him during the summer because, it appears, they knew about his injury and knew he needed surgery. The mismanagement, which played out as he entered a contract year, likely <a href=\"https://www.orlandopinstripedpost.com/2018/7/5/17537266/nba-free-agency-2018-isaiah-thomas-orlando-magic\">cost Thomas a nine-figure deal</a>.</p> <p>Last year Kyrie Irving was told he needed surgery after getting a second opinion on his injured left knee. The Celtics\u2019 team doctors told him that he didn\u2019t. Irving held strong despite the external pressures, had his surgery and came back the next year in top form.

      "bodyText": "On Monday night, NBA fans around the world tuned in to what should have been a story of triumph. Here\u2019s how it might have played out: 3-1 down in the NBA finals and facing elimination, Kevin Durant battles through injury with superhuman perseverance to propel the Golden State Warriors to victory. It goes down as one of the greatest performances in NBA finals history. People love this type of storyline. Isiah Thomas scoring 25 points in the third quarter of Game 6 of the 1988 NBA finals while hobbling on one foot for the Detroit Pistons. Or Willis Reed walking out of the tunnel for the New York Knicks on his bum ankle in Game 7 in 1970. The wounded hero persevering through pain. Everything was aligned for Durant to be added to that list. High school, college and professional coaches across the country were salivating at the thought of using Durant to show their players that \u201cpain is weakness leaving your body\u201d. They would have used KD as an example to young athletes that the game, not your health, is what matters most. I\u2019ve seen it all before. Throughout my playing career, I saw teammates told to play through pain or discomfort only to go down with more severe injuries shortly afterwards. Jarvis Hayes told me the medical team said he simply had a case of tendinitis in his knee. Turned out he had a broken kneecap that ruined his entire career. Kwame Brown told me they said he was told to play through the discomfort in his leg to show everyone he was worthy of being the No 1 overall pick in the 2000 draft. Turned out it was a torn hamstring. I saw Richard Hamilton go off on the training staff after he learned he\u2019d been playing through a torn groin only disclosed to him after the team was out of playoff contention. Deshawn Stevenson told me a trainer said there was nothing seriously wrong with his back that ice and stim couldn\u2019t fix. After the season, it was discovered he in fact had an inflamed L5 nerve that was stuck underneath a disc, requiring not one but two back surgeries to repair. None of this is hearsay, but instances I witnessed first-hand and verified with my former teammates over the past week. My point in bringing it up now is not to put the medical staff on blast, but illustrate a worrying fact: This happens all the time in professional sports. Why? Because team doctors and trainers have a conflict of interest: they are hired by the teams and are in essence employees of the organization rather than the players. By definition they are looking out for what benefits the team rather than the welfare of the individual athlete. The Warriors\u2019 medical staff appears to have RG3\u2019d Durant, who now faces a lengthy recovery after undergoing surgery on Wednesday for a torn achilles. He should not have been playing, period. Thomas and Reed shouldn\u2019t have been playing, either. The risks outweighed the rewards, even from a team standpoint. Durant is a franchise player. A player with the capability of single-handedly turning an entire NBA finals around. A player the Warriors should do everything in their power to convince they are worth re-signing with. Instead, they showed the exact opposite. It doesn\u2019t matter if Durant insisted on playing, the team should have had the medical integrity to tell him no. But the Warriors are not the only guilty party here. Other teams do similar things all the time. I hope all young players see what happened with Durant and learn that no matter what the circumstances or how big the game is, health always comes first. Athletes should always get a second opinion from their own doctors, ones who are unaffiliated with their teams. If Durant \u2013 and other athletes \u2013 want an example of how to handle injuries, they only need to look at a man who has dominated this year\u2019s playoffs: Kawhi Leonard. Leonard weathered unfair criticism from pundits, coaches, teammates and fans last season when he was with the San Antonio Spurs because he chose to sit out most of the season with an ankle injury. The Spurs\u2019 team doctors said he was fine. But Leonard got a second opinion from his own medical staff, did what was in his best interest and recovered to flourish with Toronto this season. His teammate Danny Green reportedly played through a torn groin last year under the watch of the same doctors that misdiagnosed Kawhi. And bear in mind the Spurs are one of the most respected organizations in the NBA, with one of the league\u2019s most respected coaches. The bottom line is that any team will throw an injured player into action if they feel it is best for the organization. Teams will publicly criticize athletes if they don\u2019t play. And if they do play and re-injure themselves, or just don\u2019t play up to expectations, they can be expect to be brushed aside quickly. I remember watching Grant Hill during the late 1990s as he was poised to take over the league, averaging 21.6 points per game during his first six seasons with the Detroit Pistons and drawing comparisons to Michael Jordan. When he suffered an ankle injury a week before the 2000 playoffs, he was called out for not playing through it. People openly questioned how serious it was and accused him of being soft, just like they were saying about Durant in these playoffs. Hill rushed back from injury and was never the same player, years later saying the Pistons\u2019 medical staff derailed his entire career. Another example is the young Isaiah Thomas, who claims the Boston Celtics\u2019 team doctors gave him misleading information regarding a hip injury suffered ahead of the 2017 playoffs. He played in the postseason despite the injury (and the death of his sister), but wound up reaggravating the injury during the Eastern Conference finals. The Celtics traded him during the summer because, it appears, they knew about his injury and knew he needed surgery. The mismanagement, which played out as he entered a contract year, likely cost Thomas a nine-figure deal. Last year Kyrie Irving was told he needed surgery after getting a second opinion on his injured left knee. The Celtics\u2019 team doctors told him that he didn\u2019t. Irving held strong despite the external pressures, had his surgery and came back the next year in top form. There is a recurring theme here. I coach my son\u2019s AAU team, the FBCG Dynamic Disciples, and the first thing I did yesterday was message them to make sure they learned a lesson from what happened to Durant. Athletes are competitive by nature: they will always want to play. That\u2019s how we are built. But it shouldn\u2019t be up to them. A solution to this league-wide issue was suggested to me by a lawyer named Marlon Amprey. He proposed that the National Basketball Players Association assemble a group of independent doctors and specialists, with no connection to the teams whatsoever, who can provide second and third opinions on injuries, giving players detailed reports on their health and risk of injury. All doctors\u2019 reports issued by teams that drastically differ from the independent assessment should go under review with repercussions for team doctors and trainers who medically clear players who shouldn\u2019t be out there. When it comes down to it, you have to make the decision that is best for you. Hopefully what\u2019s happened to Durant, who\u2019s admired by so many young athletes as one of the best players in the game today, will be a lesson they won\u2019t forget.",

It seems we are.</p> <h2>Give Peltz a voice</h2> <p>Here comes Nelson Peltz, a name to strike fear in boardrooms. The veteran US activist investor has taken pops at PepsiCo and Procter &amp; Gamble in the recent past and now he\u2019s alighted on Ferguson, the FTSE 100 supplier of heating and plumbing equipment formerly known as Wolseley. Peltz\u2019s funds have bought a 6% stake, worth about \u00a3730m, and want some action.</p> <p>The specific grumble, it seems, is that Ferguson\u2019s shares are less highly rated than those of US peers. City analysts agree with the analysis - they put the discount at 25%-30%, more than you would expect, given that about four-fifths of Ferguson\u2019s business is in the US. But what\u2019s the remedy?</p> <p>If Peltz wants Ferguson to abandon its London listing and move to New York, that\u2019s not easy. As Unilever discovered, those UK funds that are only allowed to hold UK stocks tend to cling to what they\u2019ve got. A relisting proposal requires a 75% majority, a high hurdle.</p> <p>Indeed, UK investors may conclude that they\u2019ve now got the best of both worlds \u2013 a London-listed stock plus a famous US investor broadcasting his view that the shares are too cheap. The best course: let Peltz shout and see if the shares rerate. They improved 6% on Thursday, which is a start.</p> <h2>Field still waiting for Green assurance</h2> <p>For proper shouting, there\u2019s Sir Philip Green. \u201cThese people writing all this shit couldn\u2019t spell 50 quid,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/13/sir-philip-green-admits-topshop-miss-selfridge-didnt-adapt-to-changing-high-street\">he told the BBC</a>. \u201cThey all get jealous. The fact that someone can actually write out a cheque and writes one out, people don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p> <p>For the record, Sir Phil, we did like the \u00a3363m for the BHS pension fund. But will you also fully fund pensions at Arcadia beyond this week\u2019s pledges, even if your high hopes for reviving the business don\u2019t work out? Frank Field MP has requested a personal binding assurance and, as far as one can tell, he\u2019s still waiting to see it.</p>",

But, come on, installing governance safety valves must have been somebody\u2019s job, or at least been a shared responsibility of the board. The entire RBS crew can\u2019t all have been Macavity, the mystery cat. For outsiders, the most alarming part is this: the FCA won\u2019t even say if it could have pursued RBS senior managers if its post-2016 powers had been in place. \u201cThis would involve applying a new regime to a historic set of facts and it would not be appropriate for us to make a hypothetical judgement,\u201d explains the report. Not appropriate? Are we supposed just to hope or trust that the FCA will be able to nail somebody in the next GRG-style debacle? It seems we are. Give Peltz a voice Here comes Nelson Peltz, a name to strike fear in boardrooms. The veteran US activist investor has taken pops at PepsiCo and Procter &amp; Gamble in the recent past and now he\u2019s alighted on Ferguson, the FTSE 100 supplier of heating and plumbing equipment formerly known as Wolseley. Peltz\u2019s funds have bought a 6% stake, worth about \u00a3730m, and want some action. The specific grumble, it seems, is that Ferguson\u2019s shares are less highly rated than those of US peers. City analysts agree with the analysis - they put the discount at 25%-30%, more than you would expect, given that about four-fifths of Ferguson\u2019s business is in the US. But what\u2019s the remedy? If Peltz wants Ferguson to abandon its London listing and move to New York, that\u2019s not easy. As Unilever discovered, those UK funds that are only allowed to hold UK stocks tend to cling to what they\u2019ve got. A relisting proposal requires a 75% majority, a high hurdle. Indeed, UK investors may conclude that they\u2019ve now got the best of both worlds \u2013 a London-listed stock plus a famous US investor broadcasting his view that the shares are too cheap. The best course: let Peltz shout and see if the shares rerate. They improved 6% on Thursday, which is a start. Field still waiting for Green assurance For proper shouting, there\u2019s Sir Philip Green. \u201cThese people writing all this shit couldn\u2019t spell 50 quid,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cThey all get jealous. The fact that someone can actually write out a cheque and writes one out, people don\u2019t like it.\u201d For the record, Sir Phil, we did like the \u00a3363m for the BHS pension fund. But will you also fully fund pensions at Arcadia beyond this week\u2019s pledges, even if your high hopes for reviving the business don\u2019t work out? Frank Field MP has requested a personal binding assurance and, as far as one can tell, he\u2019s still waiting to see it.",

The watchdog agency made its recommendation after concluding that Conway violated a US law, known as the Hatch Act, that bars government employees from engaging in political campaign activity. In a report addressed to the president, the special counsel\u2019s office identified Conway, long a prominent Trump aide and constantly at his side since he took office while others around him were ousted, as a \u201crepeat offender\u201d of the Hatch Act who has \u201cshown disregard for the law\u201d. \u201cMs Conway\u2019s violations, if left unpunished, would send a message to all federal employees that they need not abide by the Hatch Act\u2019s restrictions,\u201d the report stated. \u201cHer actions thus erode the principal foundation of our democratic system: the rule of law.\u201d Last month, the government watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew) filed a complaint with the special counsel\u2019s office after Conway attacked 2020 Democratic presidential candidates \u2013 namely former vice-president Joe Biden \u2013 in televised interviews while acting in her official government role. Although the special counsel\u2019s office acts as a federal investigative and prosecutorial agency and typically has great sway, Conway\u2019s fate is in the hands of Trump, her ultimate boss, and he has often singled her out for praise. Trump has also stood by Conway even as her husband, conservative lawyer George Conway, has disparaged him in a series of scathing opinion articles in national publications and on Twitter \u2013 and even called for Trump\u2019s impeachment. White House spokesman Steven Groves swiftly hit back at the report, stating: \u201cThe Office of Special Counsel\u2019s unprecedented actions against Kellyanne Conway are deeply flawed and violate her constitutional rights to free speech and due process.\u201d \u201cOthers, of all political views, have objected to the OSC\u2019s unclear and unevenly applied rules, which have a chilling effect on free speech for all federal employees,\u201d he added. \u201cIts decisions seem to be influenced by media pressure and liberal organizations \u2013 and perhaps OSC should be mindful of its own mandate to act in a fair, impartial, non-political manner, and not misinterpret or weaponize the Hatch Act.\u201d The special counsel\u2019s report bears no relation to the work of Robert Mueller, who was specifically appointed in a separate capacity pertaining to the Trump-Russia investigation relating to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The report stated that Conway had run afoul of the Hatch Act on several occasions. In addition to her recent comments about Biden, she sparked similar ethics concerns by advocating for and against candidates in the 2017 Alabama special election. Conway was also forced to apologize after promoting Ivanka Trump\u2019s clothing line in a TV interview in the early days of the Trump administration. The special counsel\u2019s office criticized Conway for not only continuing to disregard the Hatch Act but also downplaying its significance, stating in an interview last month: \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to silence me through the Hatch Act, it\u2019s not going to work. Let me know when the jail sentence starts.\u201d Noah Bookbinder, the executive director at Crew, issued a statement on Thursday echoing calls for Conway be dismissed from her role. \u201cConway\u2019s repeated violations and publicly expressed disdain for the law show a dangerous disregard for governmental ethics, the rule of law and the long-held understanding that government officials should not use their official positions to advance partisan politics,\u201d Bookbinder said.",

The sun is shining and the scene is set. It might be hyperbolic to say that this encounter with Brazil is do or die for the Matildas, but it certainly comes pretty close. Lose or draw today and the Australians face a must-win clash with Jamaica next week; the probable outcome being a third-placed finish in Group C and a tough Round of 16 opponent. If the Matildas continue their strong form against Brazil - they have won four straight - Australia\u2019s campaign will be back on the road and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/09/australia-stunned-by-late-italy-winner-at-womens-world-cup\">the loss to Italy</a> swiftly forgotten.</p> <p>For Brazil, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/09/cristiane-hat-trick-gives-brazil-perfect-start-to-womens-world-cup-campaign-jamaica\">their 3-0 triumph over Jamaica</a> on Sunday was the perfect way to snap a nine game losing streak. But Jamaica were hardly difficult opposition. Today\u2019s match should indicate whether that victory was a temporary uptick on a long, downhill slump, or a return to their scintillating form of old.</p> <p>Whatever the case, I\u2019m standing by here at Stade de la Mosson to bring you a blow by blow account.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ll leave it at that. An incredibly impressive comeback from the Matildas - truly one for the ages. There will be plenty of analysis to come, but for now here\u2019s Richard Parkin\u2019s match report. Thanks for joining me and sending in so many emails and tweets. I will be back for the clash with Jamaica - until then! Milicic: Hopefully this win tonight brings the country together. But let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. It\u2019s the first win. Coach Milicic speaks: It\u2019s one of the finest Australian performances I have seen. I am really really proud of the girls. A topical comment from Robert Wonder how the USA would\u2019ve celebrated this win... The mood was buoyant in the mixed zone - that was some win from the Matildas. Coach Ante Milicic is speaking to the press now. Here\u2019s a choice stat, via Fifa: the Matildas are only the second team in Women\u2019s World Cup history to win after a two-goal deficit. Tactical guru Richard Parkin has been sitting next to me all game \u2013 his match report will be with you shortly. Ella Reilly has been in the stands and will have her analysis online later, while Sarah Groubes should be filing her playing ratings any minute now. I will have some reaction from the press conference in the live blog, and then call it a day. Left without comment. Some choice words from Sam Kerr for the critics, that probably aren\u2019t entirely fit for print. The choice quote: \u2018Suck on that one\u2019 Sam Kerr on television: We\u2019re back. Indeed. Is this the miracle in Montpellier? Brazil had not given up a goal in the group-stage of the World Cup since 2003 - and then they gave up three, after being two-nil up. The Matildas had their backs to the wall, and they replied in style. It\u2019s all over! Australia have pulled off a dramatic comeback. Scenes here at the Stade de la Mosson. This win clearly means everything for the Matildas. 90+5 min: Free-kick to Brazil from the centre-circle. The last play of the game? 90+4 min: Foord comes off for Roestbakken, who is making her national team debut in what will surely be the final minute of this match. Dave adds his two cents to the offside controversy The original offside call on the o.g. was a clear and obvious error. I don\u2019t see why people are finding this difficult - read the 4 bullet points under \u201cinterfering with an opponent by\u201d in Law 11 (text is in the 18:35 update) - Kerr clearly didn\u2019t do any of those specific things. The fact that the defender only felt the need to head it because Kerr was there might seem like it should be a consideration, but it isn\u2019t covered by Law 11, given that Kerr didn\u2019t actually challenge for the ball. 90+3 min: Australia try to make another sub, but the referee restarts play before they get their chance. 90+2 min: They were VARing for a possible penalty to Brazil, but it did not amount to anything. 90+2 min: Williams punches away a dangerous cross to keep the Brazilians at bay. 90 min: Ludmila is trying her best to create something for Brazil, but it just isn\u2019t falling for her. The fourth official indicate she\u2019ll have another five minutes Dr Lemon writes: Australia vs Brazil in the Women\u2019s World Cup has it all: a storming comeback from Australia, end-to-end action, and plenty of needle. All it needs it some egregious diving and global financial skullduggery... 88 min: The Australians have been camped in the Brazilian half for a while. They won\u2019t be unhappy with that. 86 min: Another yellow, this time for Luana. Michael writes in: The biggest issue with Brazil\u2019s o.g. is that VAR is only supposed to act on \u201cobvious errors\u201d. Considering we\u2019re still discussing it and the refs looked at it around 50 times, I would\u2019ve said flagging offside wasn\u2019t an obvious error and we should still be at 2-2. 84 min: Andressa collects a yellow card for slapping Kellong-Knight on the face with a trailing hand while on the ball. She gives the referee some lip, too, for good measure. Australia earn a well-positioned free-kick. More helpful context on that offside/not-offside call. If, if, Australia win this, it will be their fifth consecutive victory against Brazil. Their last loss was at the 2016 Olympics, on penalties. 82 min: The Australians take their time on an attacking corner, to soak up a minute or so. Eventually it comes in and they spread it wide from the left to right and back to the defence. Classic delay tactics. Eventually they punt it forward, without success. 10 minutes plus change to go. Breath. It\u2019s going to be a hectic 10 minutes. This aptly summarises the situation, one might say. 78 min: Some scrambling defending from the Matildas deny Brazil. One of the Brazilians has gone down with a cramp. I can\u2019t blame her - my fingers are seizing up typing all this. What a match! 77 min: Kerr with another attempt, this time wide, after a nice switch move from Australia finds her on the left. It is very much still all to play for here in Montpellier. Ruth\u2019s eyebrows are raised further. So as the defenders had to react to Kerr so she is therefore offside. What should they do? Not tried to clear it away? 76 min: Kathleen darts down the right side for Brazil, but her attempt is knocked out and it is a goal-kick. Someone on Twitter has helpfully consulted the laws of the game: 75 min: Another chance for Kerr, who has come alive in the second half. She fires it at Barbara, but without enough power to cause any concern. Joshua, with this linguistic query: Is this now the appropriate time to say \u201cthe cat\u2019s among the pigeons\u201d or no? I struggle with that one. 74 min: Australia with an attacking throw-in, halfway down the Brazilian half. Before they take it, Cristiane is subbed for Beatriz. Kevin, with his eyebrows raised: Surely that call is wrong? I mean, Kerr is offside, Monica doesn\u2019t touch it if she knows but how is she supposed to know? Isn\u2019t there something about active players in an offside position? Ruth asks: Can you please explain to me why that wasn\u2019t offside. The ball was belted up to a player who was offside. I think, Ruth, that it was because Kerr did not interfere with play until she was back onside. But I agree that this call will raise a number of eyebrows. Peter has this for us, re my abject Portuguese skills. Formiga is the Portuguese word for \u201cant\u201d. Whenever I see or hear her name, I\u2019m reminded of the renowned Brazilian chef named Alex Atala, who has made his name, in part, from serving Amazonian ants over coconut meringue, and pineapples. Anyway, I\u2019m rooting for Brazil in this one. Here\u2019s hoping that Formiga makes the Australian defence feel the creepy-crawlies! 70 min: Substitute for Australia, Gielnik off for Raso. 69 min: It\u2019s a goal! VAR awards it to Australia. Own-goal from Monica. Kerr was offside at the beginning of the movement, but VAR and referee Staubli must have decided she was back onside before she interfered with play. Well, it\u2019s all happening here in Montpellier. I\u2019ll level with you, reader, no-one really know what is happening. It seems Kerr was offside but they are reviewing and reviewing. The crowd has got bored and started to do the Mexican wave. 66 min: Goal Australia! But no, it\u2019s offside from Kerr. No, they\u2019ve gone to VAR. It\u2019s all happening. 64 min: Brazil with a corner, bounces around in the area but eventually Australia clears - to Brazil. They go on another raid, only for the ball to go out for Williams to restart. It is end-to-end stuff at the moment. Peter writes in with a suggestion for Fifa to address the sparse crowds in France: I\u2019m surprised that Fifa hasn\u2019t resorted to digitally filling in empty seats to resemble the on-screen crowds in the video game that bears its name. 62 min: Australia win a free-kick on the left-hand side of the Brazil box. 61 min: Australia are camped in the Brazil penalty area for all of about 20 seconds, but can\u2019t make anything of it. Eduardo responds to some of my attemptd at VAR humour: In Uruguay, f\u00fatbol is watched and discussed at the many bars, modest neighborhood pubs, with pizza and grilled meats available. So, one of the top rated TV programs on f\u00fatbol was \u2018Pol\u00e9mica en el bar\u2019 - \u2018discussions/arguments at the bar. Guess what program is now called? Of course \u201cPol\u00e9micas del VAR\u201d. 59 min: Brazil almost goes down the other end and reclaim the advantage, but the ball goes out for a corner. Exciting stuff! 58 min: Kerr! Logarzo lofts in a nice cross from the right and Kerr almost connects, the ball flying past Barbara. The Matildas are back on level pegging. 55 min: Corner for Brazil. Debinha fires in but the Matildas clear without much difficulty. If you\u2019ll forgive the self-indulgence, Melissa, an Aussie abroad, writes in: Hola from Costa Rica. Have WiFi on a bus and loving your commentary. Go Australia! Thanks Melissa! It\u2019s times like these (namely while looking for amusing tweets) about the game, when I really regret my lack of Portuguese. 50 min: Nice free-kick from Australia, but it misses everyone. Barbara is at sea but manages to recover in-time for the follow-up shot. 48 min: Brazil try to dance down the left, without much success. They win the throw and try again, this time having more luck. A beautiful run by Cristiane as she nutmegs Kennedy and fires towards Williams, but the shot goes wide. Jogo bonito, that. Keep the messages coming in. Justin writes: That was the first group-round goal conceded by Brazil since September 27, 2003. They were unbeaten and gave up 0 goals in 2007, 2011, and 2015. Mark has this to say: The defender grabbed and pulled the shirt of the attacker, so a clear penalty. Even if it did not destabilise the attacker very much. Brazil made two changes at the break: Formiga and Marta both off, Luana and Ludmila on. Australia are unchanged. 46 min: Peep! We\u2019re back, live from the Stade de la Mosson. It\u2019s hot on the pitch (see prior post about tension) but become rather cool in the stands. I am now suitably jacket-ed. Michael asks, and answers... Why are there so many empty seats in a supposed near sell out tournament? FIFA!!! One thing very noticeable even from high in the stadium where the press box is perched: these teams do not like each other. There is some serious animosity out on the pitch. This might explain some of it: That was quite the first-half of football. Australia looked the better team for much of it, before a penalty and a nice strike from Cristiane put the Brazilians two up. It seemed the Matildas were in for a half-time lambasting from coach Ante Milicic, before they nabbed one back on the stroke of half-time. A big second 45 ahead! Rob writes in from the US of A: I understand that Sam Kerr is one of the great players in the world. However, I\u2019ve seen her turn the ball over countless times this match and she\u2019s never keen on winning it back. What gives? Peep! That\u2019s the end of the first stanza. I\u2019ll be back shortly with some analysis. 45+1 min: BAM! Australia get one back on the nick of half-time. Logarzo knocks on a cross via her head, and Foord collects at the far-corner. Just what the Matildas needed, but Brazil will still go into the break with an advantage. OB Jato wrote in to predict a 2-0 win to Brazil. I think I need a VAR check on whether their email arrived before or after their second goal... 44 min: Australia search vainly in an attempt to get one back before the break. There is some slow build-up play via the back-line, before the Matildas eventually opt for Carpenter on the right. Gielnik collects a pass on the top of the box, and fires it straight into Barbara\u2019s gloves. If Keith is still reading, I\u2019m reliably informed that the Italians are indeed showing the match - on RAI Sport2. Thanks to Markus and an unnamed reader for the dual tips. Kelsey from Seattle writes in - she\u2019s in the office and can\u2019t watch the match, so wants to know about the legitimacy of that penalty. Readers - do let me know what you think. I think it was given for Kellond-Knight dragging down her counterpart as she fell - I\u2019ve seen those given, I\u2019ve seen those not given. Well. Australia are in a world of pain here. They\u2019ve probably been the better team - not by a long way, but they have definitely had more opportunities. But Brazil have been clinical and they find themselves two goals to the good. 39 min: The hat-trick hero from Sunday is back on the score sheet! Heads a beautiful cross past Williams, and the Australians have a mountain to climb. 37 min: Sam Kerr has her first half-chance of the game, toe-poking at Barbara who collects without too much difficulty. 36 min: Australia look to find a route through the middle, before again going wide to a trio of players on the right. Nothing comes of it. Possession stats have now evened out - 53% to Australia. 33 min: The Aussies almost got a head to a corner, but Brazil\u2019s Barbara punches clear. For Brazil, meanwhile, this is a perfect start. They haven\u2019t beaten Australia since 2016 and this will very much calm the nerves. Also, how\u2019s this for a stat. The Matildas\u2019 now have their backs against the wall. While they remain a chance of qualifying for the next round even if they lose here, by beating Jamaica and being one of the better third-placed teams, that route will be arduous. Australia need to hit back here. Can they? It seems the penalty was against Kellond-Knight for a foul on Santos. Seemed a little harsh on first review but VAR presumably did its thing. The Matildas\u2019 2019 World Cup campaign continues to sour. 27 min: Marta hits it clinically to the left. That\u2019s her billionth World Cup goal*. * actual figure to be confirmed. 25 min: Brazil penalty. Not entirely clear what happened - more when I can figure out what has gone on. Keith from Canberra is currently in Italy and is very disappointed to have discovered that the Italians are not showing this game and the SBS live stream is geo-blocked. Commiserations Keith. You can follow along on here instead. 20 min: Referee Staubli from the usually neutral Switzerland has determined that it was not a penalty to Australia. Some Aussie fans boo half-heartedly. It\u2019s VAR o\u2019clock! 19 min: Yallop goes down in the box and there\u2019s talk of a penalty, but the referee waves it away. 17 min: Bit of biff going on between Cristiane and van Egmond. Unclear what started it, but the referee soon brings everything under control. 15 min: Andressa goes on a delightful mazy run down the right for Brazil, sending in a nicely weighted ball which bounces just out of reach of the on-rusher attacker. My inbox and Twitter feed are suspiciously quiet (I suspect that might correlate with it being 2.15am on the east coast of Australia right now). But that\u2019s no excuse for the rest of the world. Get your missives in via email or twitter me @KieranPender. 14 min: This time the Australians raid down the left, and win a corner. They are looking dangerous from both flanks. 13 min: First yellow card of the match goes to veteran Formiga, playing in her record seventh (SEVENTH!) World Cup. 12 min: Another chance for Australia from the right, another missed opportunity after some back-and-forth in the box... 11 min: Williams rushes off her line to make a save - a tense moment for the Matildas after Cristiane caused danger. 10 min: Australia are making a lot of hay on the right-hand side, but their frequent crosses into Sam Kerr are failing to connect. Still, dangerous - and Brazil will need to improve their defensive effort on that side. 8 min: I was beginning to suspect that Australia were enjoying the lion\u2019s share of possession and Fifa have proven me right: 72%, at the time of writing. But they haven\u2019t made it count, yet. 5 min: Ellie Carpenter making an impact on the right for Australia - she smashes in a nice ball, which bounces around but no Matilda can connect and Brazil eventually clear. Carpenter was one of the highlights in Australia\u2019s otherwise disappointing performance against Italy. She\u2019s just 19 and has a big future ahead of her. 3 min: Australia are right back down the other end, with Foord swinging a ball in but it amounts to nothing. Fairly end-to-end football so far. 2 min: Brazil get the first real opportunity of the match, with Tamires breaking down the left wing. She fires the ball in but Australian custodian Williams smothers it without difficulty. 1 min: Peeepppppp! We are underway, with the Matildas kicking off. Old rivals Australia and Brazil in the second-round of Group C matches at the 2019 Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup. Let\u2019s go! The anthems are blaring and we are just minutes away from kick-off. Don\u2019t go anywhere! With 10 minutes to kick-off, the Fifa DJ starts cycling through the usual selection of tracks. AC/DC\u2019s Thunderstruck is a firm favourite, and you know things are about to get serious when \u2018Seven Nation Army\u2019 by the White Stripes begins to crank. At the men\u2019s World Cup in Russia, the Socceroos would be serenaded by classic \u2018Down Under\u2019 by Men at Work. No such luck for the Matildas. We should start a petition... I have crowdsourced predictions from the Guardian Australia\u2019s coverage team (plus AAP\u2019s ever-reliable scribe Ben McKay), which indicates we are a fairly optimistic bunch and expecting a high-scoring affair in Montpellier: Ella Reilly: 3-2 Australia Richard Parkin: 3-0 Australia Kieran Pender: 3-1 Australia Ben McKay: 2-2 draw Our friends at The Fiver, meanwhile, have tipped a 3-1 win for Brazil. Interesting choice of words from Australia\u2019s Alana Kennedy ahead of the match: We have the rivalry with Brazil now at the last two major tournaments, where we knocked them out and they knocked us out. But when you\u2019re on the field I don\u2019t give a shit who [Marta] is \u2013 she\u2019s an opponent and I want to beat her. Key points from the teams: Australia\u2019s Elise Kellond-Knight is back in the starting line-up, but has been shuffled to left-back, while Emily Gielnik has been brought into the attacking fold, replacing Hayley Raso. The big news for Brazil is that veteran Marta, six-time Fifa player of the year, has been elevated into the XI after spending the Jamaica game on the bench. Both teams have brought colourful contingents of supporters to Montpellier. For those who prefer their line-ups in visual form: This is the sort of content I can get behind. Here are the line-ups: Australia (4-3-3): Williams, Kellond-Knight, Catley, Kennedy, Carpenter, Logarzo, van Egmond, Yallop, Foord, Kerr (c), Gielnik Brazil (4-1-4-1): Barbara, Thaisa, Tamires, Andressa, Formiga, Debinha, Marta (c), Cristiane, L Santos, Kathellen, M\u00f4nica And Parkin\u2019s preview of today\u2019s encounter. As I just told him in the media centre, his great opening paragraph \u2013 complete with Caesar, the Rubicon and some Latin \u2013 is actually somewhat ironic given Montpellier is one of the few major settlements in the south of France that doesn\u2019t have a Roman past. How\u2019s that for #history! My colleague Richard Parkin has been busy of late. Here\u2019s his take on the Matildas\u2019 long-standing rivalry with Brazil: Some initial pre-reading for you all \u2013 our comprehensive team guides to Australia and Brazil respectively: Hello and welcome to Montpellier. The sun is shining and the scene is set. It might be hyperbolic to say that this encounter with Brazil is do or die for the Matildas, but it certainly comes pretty close. Lose or draw today and the Australians face a must-win clash with Jamaica next week; the probable outcome being a third-placed finish in Group C and a tough Round of 16 opponent. If the Matildas continue their strong form against Brazil - they have won four straight - Australia\u2019s campaign will be back on the road and the loss to Italy swiftly forgotten. For Brazil, their 3-0 triumph over Jamaica on Sunday was the perfect way to snap a nine game losing streak. But Jamaica were hardly difficult opposition. Today\u2019s match should indicate whether that victory was a temporary uptick on a long, downhill slump, or a return to their scintillating form of old. Whatever the case, I\u2019m standing by here at Stade de la Mosson to bring you a blow by blow account. Do let me know what you think along the way, via email or Twitter: @KieranPender.",

      "bodyText": "Record numbers of cancer patients are waiting longer than they should to see a specialist because NHS services cannot cope with the rise in people suspected of having the disease. In April 19,963 people in England had to wait more than the 14-day maximum to have their first appointment with a cancer specialist \u2013 by far the largest number since records began. NHS hospitals are supposed to ensure that 93% of all those referred by their GP for suspected cancer see a specialist within a fortnight. But April was also the first time since the target was introduced in October 2009 that fewer than 90% did so. Performance was just 89.9% \u2013 the worst ever. \u201cWhen someone is first diagnosed or hears the words \u2018we think it could be cancer\u2019, their world often turns upside down in a single moment. The wait to see a specialist or to start treatment is an agonising time already, and facing further delays can make things even worse\u201d, said Kate Goldie, a senior cancer information nurse specialist at Macmillan Cancer Support. \u201cThose affected experience worry and uncertainty cannot go about their daily lives, while relatives are left feeling helpless,\u201d she added. NHS England data show that hospital trusts have failed to meet the 93% target in 10 of the last 12 months amid growing demand on, and serious staff shortages, in cancer services. Jonathan Ashworth, Labour\u2019s shadow health secretary, said: \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful that suspected cancer patients aren\u2019t being seen on time, especially as we know that early diagnosis leads to better outcomes.\u201d In addition, two-thirds (66%) of trusts failed in April to ensure that the required 85% of cancer patients referred for urgent treatment within 62 days did start their care on time. Another grim batch of NHS monthly performance statistics also showed that the waiting list of people referred for non-urgent care in hospital is the biggest on record at 4.3 million and that just 86% are treated within 18 weeks, even though it should be 92%. \u201cThe latest set of NHS figures show a health service descending into an ever-deepening crisis and closer to a system unfit for purpose. Hospital, general practice and community services are struggling to cope\u201d, said Dr Rob Harwood, chair of the consultants committee at the British Medical Association, the doctors\u2019 union. The only good news was that staff vacancies have fallen from 102,000 to 96,000. However, the number of unfilled posts in nursing is rising. Separate figures released by NHS Improvement (NHSI) revealed that England\u2019s 240 NHS trusts now owe a staggering \u00a314bn to the government for emergency loans they have taken out to pay their running costs. Experts said the total \u2013 by far the highest ever and up from \u00a311bn last year \u2013 showed that years of under-funding during 2010 to 2019 had left the NHS unable to function within the budgets it had been given. The \u00a314bn is the sum total of bailouts that the Department of Health and Social Care has given trusts in recent years when they have hit serious financial problems, so they can continue to pay their staff and bills. \u201cThe rapid growth in debt to the Department of Health is driven by the need for emergency loans from the department to pay the bills trusts aren\u2019t able to put off: wages to staff and vital supplies. The scale of such loans is now so significant that in 2017 trusts owed more to the DH than they did to PFI companies\u201d, said Sally Gainsbury, a senior policy analyst at the Nuffield Trust health thinktank. While trusts recorded a combined deficit of \u00a3571m in 2018-19, down from \u00a3966m the year before, NHSI also admitted that the health service\u2019s underlying deficit worsened from \u00a34.3bn last year to \u00a35bn. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS providers, which represents trusts, said trusts had put in \u201ca strong financial performance\u201d and improved the quality of care last year, given the huge pressures on hospitals. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 June 2019 to clarify that the 93% waiting time target is to see a specialist, not an oncologist specifically as stated in an earlier version.",

      "bodyText": "A much-vaunted Australian side recovered from the threat of group stage ignominy in a match featuring five goals, VAR, a comeback from 2-0 down and champion players inspired by enmity for each other. Given the intense rivalry between the nations in recent tournaments, Fifa proceeded with caution, appointing a Swiss referee. Esther Staubli attempted to govern proceedings with cool neutrality but the temperature only continued to rise inside the Stade de la Mosson. Marta, back in the blue of Brazil and keen to exert her influence imperiously, received the first talking to. A minute later Andressa caught Tameka Yallop with a flailing arm before the veteran Formiga was the first in the book for a calculated foul. Emily van Egmond and Cristiane squared up off the ball, the snarls continued, Tamires clattered Ellie Carpenter and Caitlin Foord returned the measure on Andressa. With almost 20 minutes gone Yallop went down in the area under the challenge of Thaisa. VAR suggested a handball in the buildup making any foul moot, but it was a use of the hand by Elise Kellond-Knight moments later that drew a short blast from Staubli\u2019s whistle. Brazil\u2019s right-back Let\u00edcia Santos marauded forward, and her opposite full-back was adjudged to have a hand on her shirt inside the box. Up stepped Marta. A flare of the nostrils, a puff of the cheeks from the six-time world player of the year. Lydia Williams picked one side; Marta the other. If USA\u2019s celebrations against Thailand had become a talking point, Marta almost taunted her opponents with a full-bench low five as Brazil\u2019s staff and players flocked to the sideline. As the match recommenced, both sides maintained the incredible intensity. Tamires nutmegged Emily Gielnik, before finding Debinha. She crossed for Cristiane and the woman with eyes on the golden boot rose above Steph Catley, who was pressed centrally because of Clare Polkinghorne\u2019s injury. Catley, the natural left-back, was giving away 5cm. It could have been a foot such was the Brazilian\u2019s determined climb. A perplexed look flickered across Ante Milicic\u2019s face.

      "bodyText": "Australia Lydia Williams Strong game. Brave. Nothing she could have done about the penalty or header from close range. 7 Ellie Carpenter Strong again. Looked to be exposed by Marta\u2019s skill, but had the pace to recover. Paired well with Gielnik on the right flank. 7 Elise Kellond-Knight Confident early and found herself in the wrong place at the wrong time, conceding a penalty for Brazil\u2019s first goal with a quick tug of Santos\u2019 shirt. Creative throughout and added fluency to Australia\u2019s play. 8 Alanna Kennedy No mucking about, with early clearances and a confident showing. 7 Steph Catley Playing in the centre of defence after Polkinghorne was forced to rest, Catley looked confident, but was caught flat footed on Christiane\u2019s headed goal, and lucky not to concede a penalty in the dying moments. 7 Tameka Yallop Strong game from Yallop, finding space in the midfield and showing confidence on the ball. 7 Emily van Egmond Stronger game, quick touches and benefited from the extra space provided by Brazil as they sat back in the first-half. 7 Chloe Logarzo Covered plenty of territory skirting Brazil\u2019s compact defence. She teed up Caitlin Foord for Australia\u2019s first goal, and earned the equaliser with her positive play. 8 Emily Gielnik An imposing figure in attack. Brazilian defenders hung off Gielnik, giving her space with some good opportunities to feed her center-forwards but she wasn\u2019t able to take advantage of her one clean shot in the first half which was easily picked up by Barbara. 7 Caitlin Foord Came here to play with quick footwork and she ran at players early. Lost possession too easily through the first 20 minutes, but kept positive, and her timely goal before half-time lifted Australia\u2019s spirits and dampened Brazil\u2019s heading into the changerooms. 7 Sam Kerr Dangerous in the forward line. While she didn\u2019t get her name on the scoresheet, she was pivotal in two of Australia\u2019s goals, and contributed plenty in defence. Just her presence seemed to put the Brazilian defence in two minds. 7 Subs: Hayley Raso (for Gielnik 71) 7; Karly Roestbakken (for Foord 94) 7 Brazil Barbara Strong and confident in the air from the first touch and just as strong down low with a nice save from Kerr at the near post. Scoreline doesn\u2019t reflect her control on the game. 8 Let\u00edcia Santos Good early pressure on Foord forced a turnover and sparked Brazil\u2019s attack. Her charging run into the box brought about a penalty and the first goal for Brazil. 7 Kathellen A quiet achiever in a star-studded team. Did well marking Kerr and forcing the Australian attack out wide. 6 M\u00f4nica Solid and dependable in defence, just as you want your centre-back to be. Unlucky to have scored the contentious own goal. 6 Tamires The queen of nutmegs. Tamires made numerous attacking overlapping plays from left-back that stretched the defence and led to Brazil\u2019s second goal. Importantly, she was strong tracking back in defence. 9 Andressa Alves A quiet performance with some flashes of brilliance early on, including a dangerous cross that just evaded her teammate Debinha. 6 Formiga Showed her experience in conserving energy in the middle of the park, but still got to where she needed to be to direct the attack. 6 Thaisa Very busy in the middle of the field but unable to impact the game. 5 Debinha Dangerous on turnovers with super quick attacking play and was able to get in behind Australia\u2019s defence. Put the cross into Cristiane for Brazil\u2019s second goal. 8 Cristiane Masterful at controlling the ball and pushing on in attack. She positioned herself well to get in front of Catley to score a strong header for Brazil\u2019s second goal. 7 Marta Amazing foot speed and technique to get around Geilnik on her first touch of the game. Marta still has the wiles and ball control to give the defence nightmares.

Data from the financial research firm Morningstar shows that the fund was worth \u00a3480m on 3 June. The Guardian understands that the fund was worth only \u00a3353m on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>The investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown accounted for a significant portion of those redemptions. It closed its entire position in the fund when it pulled its \u00a345m holding earlier this week.</p> \n<p>Emma Wall, the head of investment analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cI can confirm that we have closed our position in Woodford Income Focus in the Hargreaves Lansdown Multi-Manager High Income fund this week.</p> \n<p>\u201cLast week we communicated to clients why we were removing the fund from the Wealth 50 list of our favourite funds as we no longer had conviction in the fund.

When he decided to quit Invesco and go it alone in 2013 it was a huge shock for the fund management industry. Invesco shares slumped by 7% on the day he announced his departure.</p>\n    <p>At Invesco Woodford held control of huge stakes in some of the UK\u2019s biggest firms, and his opinions mattered. His criticism of AstraZeneca chief executive David Brennan in the 2012 shareholder spring was widely regarded to have cost him his job, and his critique of BAE\u2019s attempted \u00a328bn merger with Airbus is acknowledged as one of the reasons the deal collapsed.</p>\n    <p>Woodford, who was widely referred to in the media as an investment \u201chero\u201d and fund management \u201cstar\u201d, had done exceedingly well over his quarter century there. A \u00a31,000 investment placed when he started at the firm in 1988 would have risen to \u00a323,000 by the time he left.</p>\n    <p>Woodford accidentally fell into fund management and hadn\u2019t heard of the term until he rocked up in the City in the 1980s sleeping on his brother\u2019s floor while looking for a job. He got his first break in insurance, before drifting into fund management. He had left school wanting to fly fighter jets but couldn\u2019t pass the RAF\u2019s aptitude test, and instead read economics and agricultural economics at the University of Exeter.</p>\n    <p>Feeling he had outgrown Invesco Perpetual, he set up his own firm Woodford Investment Management in 2014, on an industrial estate near Oxford. Within two weeks of launching, he had raised \u00a31.6bn, a UK record, and it quickly grew to \u00a316bn. In its first full year his flagship fund returned 16% and Woodford, a devotee of veteran US investor Warren Buffett, was dubbed the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-27/oracle-of-oxford-sees-red-as-stock-picking-powers-misfire\">\u201cOracle of Oxford\u201d</a>.</p>\n    <p>Asked if he ever doubted his judgment, Woodford once said: \u201cDaily. You must never, as a fund manager, stick your head in the sand saying \u2018everybody go away, I\u2019m right, I\u2019m right, I\u2019m right\u2019.

      "bodyText": "Embattled stock-picker Neil Woodford is struggling to stem outflows from his remaining open fund, with Hargreaves Lansdown dealing a major blow by pulling \u00a345m this week. Woodford\u2019s Income Focus Fund has shrunk by 25% since 3 June, when the fund manager made the shock decision to suspend trading in his flagship Equity Income Fund. The move trapped thousands of customers\u2019 investments for at least 28 days and sparked an exodus from his last openly traded fund. About \u00a3116m has been pulled from the Woodford Income Focus Fund over the last 10 days, while falling stock prices have led to further drops in the fund\u2019s value. Data from the financial research firm Morningstar shows that the fund was worth \u00a3480m on 3 June. The Guardian understands that the fund was worth only \u00a3353m on Wednesday. The investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown accounted for a significant portion of those redemptions. It closed its entire position in the fund when it pulled its \u00a345m holding earlier this week. Emma Wall, the head of investment analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cI can confirm that we have closed our position in Woodford Income Focus in the Hargreaves Lansdown Multi-Manager High Income fund this week. \u201cLast week we communicated to clients why we were removing the fund from the Wealth 50 list of our favourite funds as we no longer had conviction in the fund. We have no other exposure to the Woodford Income Focus Fund across our Multi-Manager portfolio range.\u201d The move further distances Hargreaves Lansdown from Woodford, having historically sold and promoted the investment manager\u2019s funds through its retail investment platform. It had already dropped its platform fees for clients affected by the suspension but is facing further scrutiny by the Financial Conduct Authority and the influential treasury select committee. The Conservative MP and committee chair, Nicky Morgan, wrote to the Hargreaves boss Chris Hill earlier this week, asking how much money the firm had made in fees from customers who had invested in Woodford\u2019s fund. At the end of March, Hargreaves\u2019s customers accounted for about \u00a32bn of \u00a310.6bn under Woodford\u2019s management. Woodford declined to comment.",

Apart from giving \u00a310bn in tax cuts to the rich, he cited his qualities for high office by ignoring his dire period as foreign secretary and concentrating on his time as mayor of London. He claimed credit for handling knife crime, the 2011 riots, the financial crash and the Olympics. He was Pericles presiding over Athens.</p> \n<p>This is farcical.

He capitulated to the tube unions and was a sycophant to property speculation.

He was not Pericles but Nero, a maestro of bread and circuses. His character was certainly engaging, shambolic, often entertaining, and he was a pleasure to be with. But his aides, desperate for any sign of \u201cvision\u201d, nicknamed him Boris the Boring. He admitted at one point that his mayoralty might be short-lived, given his anticipated move to Downing Street. Of that strategy it must be said, it worked. His London election success was extraordinary, not least for an Eton toff against Livingstone\u2019s cheeky-chappie Cockney.</p> \n<p>The Johnson personality is clearly not to be underrated. As democracy becomes less a matter of interests and resources, it falls back on secondary responses, on making people relaxed and comfortable about the world about them. Voters seem drawn to someone who does not take life too seriously, is casual about presentation and possesses eccentric unpredictability. People like laughing at politics, and Johnson appears a fellow human. He is preferable to the spouters of robotic cliches, such as Theresa May.</p> \n<p>Charm is discounted by political science in favour of integrity, diligence, consistency \u2013 and charisma.

      "bodyText": "Charm is politics\u2019 deadliest weapon. It is not charisma, the authority to lead through an electrifying presence. It is a subtler, more intangible quality, possessed by Boris Johnson. He may be blatantly unqualified as Britain\u2019s next prime minister, but following yesterday\u2019s first-round leadership ballot, he is still odds-on favourite. The basis for this lies in his disposition of charm. Johnson is the darling of the polls. He mesmerises punch-drunk Tories and disillusioned Labour voters alike. He emerges from his biographical record as incompetent, lazy, dissolute and a liar, yet the public\u2019s response is that he is \u201cour kind of liar\u201d. He was sacked by the Times for story fabrication and was a wildly biased reporter while in Brussels. His default mode has always been that of standup comedian: funny, unpredictable, mildly dangerous. As the current campaign of his rival, Michael Gove, is derailed for far lesser sins, his campaign appears to glide forwards on sheer force of personality. The unfairness is grotesque. Johnson is currently locked away by his handlers. This is not charisma \u2013 it is a man who cannot be allowed to cope even with a Commons election on his own. On Wednesday, he was allowed to launch his leadership bid with extreme selectivity. Apart from giving \u00a310bn in tax cuts to the rich, he cited his qualities for high office by ignoring his dire period as foreign secretary and concentrating on his time as mayor of London. He claimed credit for handling knife crime, the 2011 riots, the financial crash and the Olympics. He was Pericles presiding over Athens. This is farcical. The London mayor is largely a figurehead, who administers almost nothing. Johnson\u2019s crime policy was simply to get rid of his police chief. He capitulated to the tube unions and was a sycophant to property speculation. He told me to my face that he would emphatically end his predecessor Ken Livingstone\u2019s \u201cDubai-on-Thames\u201d skyscraper obsession, yet he promptly doubled their number. He travelled to Malaysia to plead for cash to build towers of empty luxury flats, thus creating the London skyline that is his memorial. I visited one such tower in Canning Town, east London, this week, with 84 empty flats owned in absentia by a single far east investor. That was Johnson\u2019s idea of \u201chousing\u201d. What the mayor did in excess was splurge money on vanity projects. His Thames cable car, his Stratford helter-skelter (\u201cLondon\u2019s Eiffel Tower\u201d), his rear-entry buses with rear-entry locked, his water cannon that may not fire, his unnecessary super-sewer and wildly over-engineered Crossrail, all wasted staggering sums. A baffling \u00a353m vanished on Johnson\u2019s fantasy garden bridge, while Hammersmith bridge rotted up-river. The \u201cBoris bike\u201d scheme \u2013 in truth Livingstone\u2019s \u2013 was supposed to cost nothing, but cost taxpayers nearly \u00a3200m in eight years. Johnson\u2019s belated visit to the scene of some of the 2011 riots was an opportunity to be photographed with a broom. Johnson should shut up about his exorbitant mayoralty. He was not Pericles but Nero, a maestro of bread and circuses. His character was certainly engaging, shambolic, often entertaining, and he was a pleasure to be with. But his aides, desperate for any sign of \u201cvision\u201d, nicknamed him Boris the Boring. He admitted at one point that his mayoralty might be short-lived, given his anticipated move to Downing Street. Of that strategy it must be said, it worked. His London election success was extraordinary, not least for an Eton toff against Livingstone\u2019s cheeky-chappie Cockney. The Johnson personality is clearly not to be underrated. As democracy becomes less a matter of interests and resources, it falls back on secondary responses, on making people relaxed and comfortable about the world about them. Voters seem drawn to someone who does not take life too seriously, is casual about presentation and possesses eccentric unpredictability. People like laughing at politics, and Johnson appears a fellow human. He is preferable to the spouters of robotic cliches, such as Theresa May. Charm is discounted by political science in favour of integrity, diligence, consistency \u2013 and charisma. That is because charm is like love, its values not analysable or susceptible to science. Yet it was deployed with aplomb by Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, and currently by the actor-president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky. Weaponised charm may yet be the new tool of tyranny. These are the waters towards which British politics is swimming. Unless Jeremy Hunt and Michael Gove can promote some stop-Boris coalition, the backwoods of the Conservative party will vote for the only candidate likely to guarantee them a parliamentary majority. But to put that to the test, Johnson will have to secure a negotiated Brexit, rather than just precipitate a parliamentary crisis and a Tory implosion. That means he must revert to some version of May\u2019s deal, and to some frictionless customs union for both Britain and Northern Ireland. Reality will soon be screaming at him, that there is no alternative. He is too intelligent not to know it. Johnson\u2019s shrewdest supporters are quietly selling the theory that their hero\u2019s notorious \u201cflexibility\u201d is what makes him ideally suited to the task. Cynicism and hypocrisy are what the country needs. Johnson will waffle and dissemble and mis-state and un-promise, until the country finds itself miraculously on the other side of the Brexit abyss. Such is modern politics, that it must rely for clear guidance on a leader\u2019s capacity to lie. But a prime minister\u2019s job is not that of mayor or even foreign secretary. It is of circus ringmaster rather than performer. Two of Johnson\u2019s idols are reputedly Disraeli and Churchill, two masters of the art of volte-face, of a denial of the past, including their own.

We\u2019ve got to move on quickly.\u201d Having rolled through India in a warm-up game before the tournament proper, it is reductive to suggest that New Zealand got away with one by not having to play Virat Kohli\u2019s side. \u201cWe would have loved to have played India today,\u201d Stead continued. \u201cThey\u2019re hot, and we feel as though we\u2019re playing reasonably well, so it would have been a really nice matchup.\u201d Having already defeated Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, the least fancied teams in the tournament, New Zealand do remain undefeated with seven points in the bank and a huge net run rate. Two wins from their remaining five fixtures should be enough to see them progress to a semi\u2011final; three will make it certain. In the short term, on Wednesday at Edgbaston they have the chance to eliminate South Africa as they did in 2015. As for India, the next trip is to Manchester on Sunday for the most watched game of any four-year cricket cycle: the Pakistan group game. If that one is rained off, the tournament organisers really will have nightmares.",

Must buy before card expires. Run to Primark. Shop too large and confusing. People walk slowly, staring at their phones. Thought this was supposed to be fast fashion. Pick up random ugly shoes and sunglasses and do not try them on. No time! Back out on street. Remember coffee ordered. Run back, get it. Coffee cold. Order another while I still have my card. Run out on to road with a coffee in each hand. I need to get presents for my London hosts. Run to a flower stand. \u201cYou take card?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cGive me some of those and some of those! I pay now!!!\u201d Drink both coffees (one too hot, the other one cold) while flowers wrapped and start shaking with caffeine and stress. Ten minutes left! Run to book store, yank a greeting card off the shelf for hosts. It could say anything. I have no time to check. Six minutes left. Too many bags now, and my cash falling from wallet. Knock over a stack of books with my oversized stems of flowers. Why did he give me giant flowers? Looking for presents for hosts. Books. Too many! Coffee jitters! Grab something with a yellow cover by author I have never heard of, blurbed by other authors l have never heard of. This will have to do! I will read it on the plane. Person on till has sleepy voice. Says: \u201cThe till\u2019s just waking up, it\u2019s a bit slow today.\u201d I scream but hold it in. He asks me how my day is going \u201cso far\u201d. \u201cSo far, so bad!\u201d Buy book and card, leave store, remember I need to get presents for hosts. Have only bought present for self and giant flowers. Two minutes. I grab two random books from shelf. Something about the financial crisis? Something about female friendship? Race to till that\u2019s still waking up. German woman gets in before me. No!!! I have 90 seconds. She\u2019s not even buying anything. She wants \u2026 she wants \u2026 WTF does she want? A book? Yes! On \u201cwalking\u201d! FFS, narrow it down!! I\u2019m almost standing on top of her, dribbling with stress. I have a minute to buy my hosts these random presents before my money is cut off!!! She\u2019s trying to explain the book. But she\u2019s doing it wrong! Instead of naming the author, she\u2019s slowly describing to the clerk the book\u2019s dimensions. She draws a book in the air with her fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s this size.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the size of a book!\u201d I yell out. The clerk sends her to the back of the shop. I throw down my books. \u201cScan now or it may not work.\u201d It\u2019s almost 7pm in Australia. I wave my card over the machine. \u201cArrgh, work! Please!\u201d We wait as the hour ticks over. \u201cApproved.\u201d \u2022 Brigid Delaney is a Guardian Australia columnist",

Some of Australia\u2019s best-known companies could face hostile shareholder resolutions at their annual meetings in the spring as the battle over climate policy moves into the country\u2019s boardrooms. Westpac acknowledged on Thursday that it has a \u201cvariance\u201d in opinion with the Business Council of Australia over \u201cclimate and energy policy and advocacy\u201d. The bank, which is committed to action to achieve net zero emissions, did not spell out exactly what the variance entailed.

Switching between Mandarin and English, Turnbull said: \u201cModern China was founded in 1949 with these words: \u2018The Chinese people have stood up\u2019. It was an assertion of sovereignty, it was an assertion of pride.

That stuff that he did at the end of 2017, that was just nuts, it was domestically and politically self-indulgent nuttiness.\u201d</p> <p>Rudd said he was in Beijing at the time of the comments, and the discussion of foreign interference was passing by without much attention from Chinese leaders.</p> <p>\u201cAnd then suddenly, in thunders Malcolm, and he picks the phrase that Mao Zedong used\u2026 Picks that phrase, or blabs it out in his own appalling rendition of Chinese, and then suddenly it was in every Chinese headline.</p> <p>\u201cYou want to pick the day when the relationship went, in my judgment unnecessarily, down the gurgle [sic], it was that day, so just be judicious about when you embark upon public language.\u201d</p> <p>Rudd also made a jibe at News Corp, of which he has been a vocal critic since leaving office, calling Rupert Murdoch \u201cthe greatest cancer on the Australian democracy\u201d.</p> <p>Rudd said that after the Chinese government decided on their \u201cred lines\u201d in the dispute with the US over tariffs, the government\u2019s position then \u201cmysteriously\u201d appeared on the front page of all the Chinese newspapers. \u201cIt\u2019s like News Limited,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Speaking about the ongoing trade war between China and the US, which has seen the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/06/trump-china-tariffs-trade-talks-tweets\">US impose tariffs of 25% on some Chinese goods</a> sold in the US, Rudd said there was an \u201coverwhelming\u201d economic case for the two countries to reach a deal, but there was a question of whether they could overcome the political barriers to do so.</p> <p>\u201cI think we\u2019re in a 50-50 territory about the likelihood of producing an agreement,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Rudd pointed to the relative weakness of China\u2019s domestic economy and the fact that Trump will not want to spook Wall Street in the lead-up to next year\u2019s election as motivation for the two leaders to reach an agreement.</p> <p>\u201cThe Trumpster knows two things, one is, I read opinion polls, and two is, I read the Dow. That\u2019s all the Trumpster\u2019s interested in... So he knows how skittish Dow sentiment is on the question of can there be a deal done on trade, so he at that level wants it done.\u201d</p> <p>But Rudd said one of the most challenging things for allies of the US including Australia was dealing with a \u201cbifurcated American administration\u201d in which the president had one view, but his departments and the bureaucracy of the administration might have another.</p> <p>\u201c[T]here is Trump-land up here which is deeply transactional and deeply non-strategic, in the sense of where does America want to be in five, 10, 15, 20 years\u2019 time? What is China\u2019s role in the future of that world? \u2026 That\u2019s not the way the Donald thing, never has been and never will be. So the danger that European and Asian allies encounter with America\u2019s chief executive and commander-in-chief is, what does he say tomorrow?\u201d</p> <p>Rudd, who served as a diplomat in Beijing before entering politics and speaks Mandarin, said in order to engage well with its regional neighbours, Australia needed to show respect, which he said was \u201csomething which doesn\u2019t necessarily come easily to the Australian way of thinking\u201d and said a key way of doing this was to learn the languages of the region.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been preaching this message for 30 years now: a much much bigger slab of us need to be comfortably bilingual and trilingual in our own region, just as a matter of what I call disciplinary etiquette,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Rudd added that it wasn\u2019t easy for him to learn Mandarin, which he describes as \u201ca crazy language to learn if you\u2019re an Anglo and grew up in rural Queensland\u201d, but said: \u201cI think this is a mark of respect \u2026 Every now and then a Chinese leader will say to you, it means a lot to us that you bothered.\u201d</p>",

But Rudd saved his most scathing comments of the evening for Turnbull, referencing an incident in December 2017 during the controversy about foreign interference and Labor MP Sam Dastyari\u2019s connections with China. When asked if he felt \u201cbullied or intimidated\u201d by China, Turnbull invoked a famous Chinese slogan to declare Australia would \u201cstand up\u201d against meddling in its national affairs. Switching between Mandarin and English, Turnbull said: \u201cModern China was founded in 1949 with these words: \u2018The Chinese people have stood up\u2019. It was an assertion of sovereignty, it was an assertion of pride. And we stand up and so we say, the Australian people stand up.\u201d \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning On Thursday night, Rudd said politicians needed to \u201cbe very judicious about when you open your big mouth\u201d. \u201cBy which I mean, Turnbull\u2019s egregious statement that the Australian people have stood up. That stuff that he did at the end of 2017, that was just nuts, it was domestically and politically self-indulgent nuttiness.\u201d Rudd said he was in Beijing at the time of the comments, and the discussion of foreign interference was passing by without much attention from Chinese leaders. \u201cAnd then suddenly, in thunders Malcolm, and he picks the phrase that Mao Zedong used\u2026 Picks that phrase, or blabs it out in his own appalling rendition of Chinese, and then suddenly it was in every Chinese headline. \u201cYou want to pick the day when the relationship went, in my judgment unnecessarily, down the gurgle [sic], it was that day, so just be judicious about when you embark upon public language.\u201d Rudd also made a jibe at News Corp, of which he has been a vocal critic since leaving office, calling Rupert Murdoch \u201cthe greatest cancer on the Australian democracy\u201d. Rudd said that after the Chinese government decided on their \u201cred lines\u201d in the dispute with the US over tariffs, the government\u2019s position then \u201cmysteriously\u201d appeared on the front page of all the Chinese newspapers. \u201cIt\u2019s like News Limited,\u201d he said. Speaking about the ongoing trade war between China and the US, which has seen the US impose tariffs of 25% on some Chinese goods sold in the US, Rudd said there was an \u201coverwhelming\u201d economic case for the two countries to reach a deal, but there was a question of whether they could overcome the political barriers to do so. \u201cI think we\u2019re in a 50-50 territory about the likelihood of producing an agreement,\u201d he said. Rudd pointed to the relative weakness of China\u2019s domestic economy and the fact that Trump will not want to spook Wall Street in the lead-up to next year\u2019s election as motivation for the two leaders to reach an agreement. \u201cThe Trumpster knows two things, one is, I read opinion polls, and two is, I read the Dow. That\u2019s all the Trumpster\u2019s interested in... So he knows how skittish Dow sentiment is on the question of can there be a deal done on trade, so he at that level wants it done.\u201d But Rudd said one of the most challenging things for allies of the US including Australia was dealing with a \u201cbifurcated American administration\u201d in which the president had one view, but his departments and the bureaucracy of the administration might have another. \u201c[T]here is Trump-land up here which is deeply transactional and deeply non-strategic, in the sense of where does America want to be in five, 10, 15, 20 years\u2019 time? What is China\u2019s role in the future of that world? \u2026 That\u2019s not the way the Donald thing, never has been and never will be. So the danger that European and Asian allies encounter with America\u2019s chief executive and commander-in-chief is, what does he say tomorrow?\u201d Rudd, who served as a diplomat in Beijing before entering politics and speaks Mandarin, said in order to engage well with its regional neighbours, Australia needed to show respect, which he said was \u201csomething which doesn\u2019t necessarily come easily to the Australian way of thinking\u201d and said a key way of doing this was to learn the languages of the region. \u201cI\u2019ve been preaching this message for 30 years now: a much much bigger slab of us need to be comfortably bilingual and trilingual in our own region, just as a matter of what I call disciplinary etiquette,\u201d he said. Rudd added that it wasn\u2019t easy for him to learn Mandarin, which he describes as \u201ca crazy language to learn if you\u2019re an Anglo and grew up in rural Queensland\u201d, but said: \u201cI think this is a mark of respect \u2026 Every now and then a Chinese leader will say to you, it means a lot to us that you bothered.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Queensland government has raised more questions about the federal government\u2019s decision to rush out its approval of Adani\u2019s groundwater management plan before calling the federal election, with the state\u2019s environment minister saying it \u201creeked of political interference\u201d. In a speech to the Queensland parliament on Thursday, Queensland\u2019s environment minister, Leeanne Enoch, said the federal government would need to justify its decision to approve a previous version of the company\u2019s groundwater plan, given Queensland regulators had required significant improvements to the document before signing it off on Thursday. The new federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, called the remarks \u201ca political line\u201d but suggested the government could be open to looking at the strengthened conditions Queensland had imposed. In separate comments to Guardian Australia, Enoch said the federal approval of the plan before the election \u201creeked of political interference\u201d. Her comments come after considerable political pressure on the Queensland government in recent weeks to grant the final approvals needed for Adani to commence clearing and other preliminary construction work at its Carmichael mine site in Queensland\u2019s Galilee Basin. The company still requires further federal approvals before it can extract any coal. Enoch said that in April, on the eve of the federal election being called, the federal environment minister approved the groundwater management plan, provided Queensland a copy of the CSIRO and Geoscience Australia report, and Adani submitted an amended version of its groundwater management plan to the Queensland government, all within the space of 30 minutes. The Queensland environmental regulator then sought additional information from the CSIRO and Geoscience Australia based on that new version, and asked Adani to strengthen it to ensure environmental protections, Enoch said. \u201cIt is interesting that the federal government approved the previous version of the GDEMP without requiring these further strengthened conditions,\u201d she said. Ley said: \u201cIt sounds just like a political line to me because, now that they have given that approval, we would probably look \u2026 we may do a similar thing to make life easier for Adani. \u201cThey have got their own process, they are entitled to undertake their own process, and I am not going to be critical of their process. If they want to be critical of ours, I am still not going to comment on it.\u201d Ley added that it was still up to Adani to comply with all of the conditions set by the Queensland government and those contained in its federal approvals. She said the Adani approvals process had been unnecessarily lengthy and that issues such as this would need to be examined through the statutory review of Australia\u2019s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, which is due to commence later this year. \u201cI think the process has taken too long,\u201d Ley said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone would disagree with that and that leads to my views on the EPBC Act and what we need to do in amending it which is due under the act in the second half of this year. \u201cI don\u2019t think it matters whether you are on the side promoting your development or preserving conservation, all would agree that the process under EPBC is unnecessarily tied up with green tape and unnecessarily lengthy.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of Australians living with a life-threatening swallowing condition could now get NDIS funding after the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) lost a high-stakes case at the administrative appeals tribunal. Experts and advocates have described the decision as a \u201cwatershed\u201d, arguing the agency would now be forced to fund swallowing supports, which are vital for people living with dysphagia. That would end a long-running battle in which the NDIA claimed the supports should be offered by the states. But the ruling may also have broader implications for people with disabilities, and for the agency\u2019s finances, as it threatens to overhaul what is considered state and NDIS responsibilities, experts said. \u201cThis judgement has the potential to drastically change what the NDIS funds,\u201d said Sara Gingold of Disability Services Consulting. \u201cIt will impact the way the scheme interacts with all other areas of government, from education to health to justice and everything in between.\u201d While it is unclear exactly how many people might be impacted by the decision, there are about 100,000 people who have dysphagia throughout Australia. People would need to be aware of the ruling in order to make use of it in dealings with the NDIA, advocates argued. In a rebuke to the NDIA, the AAT deputy president, Brian Rayment, ruled the agency was wrong to deny funding to a 34-year-old man who had dysphagia as a result of cerebral palsy. The plan created by his dietician would have costed $40 a day but the agency argued that thickening fluids requested by a speech pathologist \u2013 which helped the man swallow safely and \u201cgave him independence and confidence\u201d \u2013 were health-related, not a disability support. The tribunal has previously accepted the agency\u2019s interpretation of the law \u2013 that it did not need to fund supports considered the responsibility of another government service provider. \u201cWhether or not the other government agency actually provided that support was considered largely irrelevant,\u201d Gingold told Guardian Australia. \u201cBut in this watershed judgment, [the deputy president] \u2026 said that in the past the tribunal and the NDIA have both misinterpreted that section of the legislation.\u201d A win for advocates Darren O\u2019Donovan, an administrative law expert at La Trobe University, said the decision was a \u201cpowerful vindication of those advocates fought such a long battle to correct agency policy in this area\u201d. \u201cSwallowing and dietary support is an integral part of people\u2019s social and family lives,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt is not just preventing a person from choking (or other medical events), it enables the person to step out confidently into the world.\u201d Piers Gooding, a disability law expert at Melbourne University, said the issue had not been \u201cexamined in the Federal Court so this decision sets an important precedent\u201d. He noted about 34,000 people had cerebral palsy in Australia. While the prevalence of dysphagia among them varied, it was substantial. Gingold put the number of people impacted by the decision \u201cin the thousands\u201d. The NDIA could appeal the decision to the federal court but that risked setting a more significant precedent. A NDIA spokeswoman said: \u201cThe Agency is considering the recent decision in [the applicant] and the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA).\u201d Late last year, Guardian Australia reported the case of Tanisha Flemming, who had been denied funding as the NDIA and states argued over who should pay for the supports. In January, the federal government said it would fund some supports for people with dysphagia as an interim measure, following a campaign by the Council for Intellectual Disability. \u201cThis ruling should effectively make the interim funding agreement on swallowing therapies permanent,\u201d said Justine O\u2019Neill, the CID chief executive. \u201cIt is a positive development for many other NDIS participants who need ongoing health related therapies to be funded by the NDIS to enable them to maintain social interaction, quality of life and independence.\u201d O\u2019Donovan said the judgment underlined the need for \u201cfederal and state politicians to commit to clearer rules and improved governance for the scheme\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 June 2019 to note that it is speech pathologists (and not dieticians) who recommend thickeners for people with dysphagia.",

After sitting inside for two days and a session, a window of dry arrived at Canterbury, only for <strong>Kent</strong> to lose their last eight wickets in 46 minutes and 62 balls. </p> <p>Lewis Gregory, who had warmed up with six for 32 in the first innings, added five for 21 in the second, to finish with best match figures of 11 for 63. He had Daniel Bell Drummond, Heino Kuhn and Alex Blake all fencing to the slip and Ollie Robinson caught behind, last man out as Kent were dismissed for 59. Craig Overton took three for seven, including a double wicket maiden. Tom Abell and Azhar Ali then knocked off the 30 needed in less than seven overs. </p> <p>A delighted Somerset pocketed their fifth win of the season and 19 points. Kent captain Joe Denly was less pleased at the capitulation. \u201cThe lads in general are slightly embarrassed by that performance. It\u2019s not what Kent are about.\u201d </p> <p>Fat barrels of beer sat undrunk, and lines of white plastic chairs forlornly un upholstered, as rain and bad light again interfered on the final day of the Guildford festival. But enough play was possible for Morne Morkel to menace <strong>Yorkshire</strong> into a state of some shock, and <strong>Surrey</strong> to claim maximum bowling points. </p> <p>Gary Ballance fended a Morkel lifter to gully off the very first ball of the day, as Yorkshire contrived to lose nine for 97 and fall short of the follow-on. Morkel finished with four for 43 and Rikki Clarke three for 35. </p> <p>Jordan Clark, on Championship debut for Surrey, took two wickets in two balls in his first over of the day, bringing back memories of his hat-trick to end all hat-tricks for Lancashire against Yorkshire at Old Trafford last year. Following on, Yorkshire\u2019s openers were watchful until rain interfered one final time.</p> <p>It was the third day of four at Arundel and Swansea. Tom Lace, on loan from <strong>Middlesex</strong>, made his first Championship hundred for <strong>Derbyshire</strong>, in a record-breaking partnership with Billy Godleman, who was a career-best 211 not out at stumps in Wales. </p> <p>At Hampshire, <strong>Sussex</strong> declared overnight against <strong>Gloucestershire</strong> and between the showers Chris Dent and Gareth Roderick both made fifties as the game headed towards a draw. The matches at Grace Road, New Road and Chester-le-Street were abandoned to the lapping waters. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-14T00:06:22.611Z\">at 1.06am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d028d7b8f083c6fecd320ad\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-13T18:00:27.205Z\">7.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>It looks like things are coming </strong>to a close at Swansea after a long session.

      "bodyText": "With a whizz-bang momentum, Somerset extended their lead at the top of the Championship table to 26 points. After sitting inside for two days and a session, a window of dry arrived at Canterbury, only for Kent to lose their last eight wickets in 46 minutes and 62 balls. Lewis Gregory, who had warmed up with six for 32 in the first innings, added five for 21 in the second, to finish with best match figures of 11 for 63. He had Daniel Bell Drummond, Heino Kuhn and Alex Blake all fencing to the slip and Ollie Robinson caught behind, last man out as Kent were dismissed for 59. Craig Overton took three for seven, including a double wicket maiden. Tom Abell and Azhar Ali then knocked off the 30 needed in less than seven overs. A delighted Somerset pocketed their fifth win of the season and 19 points. Kent captain Joe Denly was less pleased at the capitulation. \u201cThe lads in general are slightly embarrassed by that performance. It\u2019s not what Kent are about.\u201d Fat barrels of beer sat undrunk, and lines of white plastic chairs forlornly un upholstered, as rain and bad light again interfered on the final day of the Guildford festival. But enough play was possible for Morne Morkel to menace Yorkshire into a state of some shock, and Surrey to claim maximum bowling points. Gary Ballance fended a Morkel lifter to gully off the very first ball of the day, as Yorkshire contrived to lose nine for 97 and fall short of the follow-on. Morkel finished with four for 43 and Rikki Clarke three for 35. Jordan Clark, on Championship debut for Surrey, took two wickets in two balls in his first over of the day, bringing back memories of his hat-trick to end all hat-tricks for Lancashire against Yorkshire at Old Trafford last year. Following on, Yorkshire\u2019s openers were watchful until rain interfered one final time. It was the third day of four at Arundel and Swansea. Tom Lace, on loan from Middlesex, made his first Championship hundred for Derbyshire, in a record-breaking partnership with Billy Godleman, who was a career-best 211 not out at stumps in Wales. At Hampshire, Sussex declared overnight against Gloucestershire and between the showers Chris Dent and Gareth Roderick both made fifties as the game headed towards a draw. The matches at Grace Road, New Road and Chester-le-Street were abandoned to the lapping waters. It looks like things are coming to a close at Swansea after a long session. Huge congratulations to Billy Godleman for his double hundred, and Tom Lace for his first century in a Derbyshire cap. That\u2019s it for CCLive! for this week, though play continues for one more day at Arundel and Swansea. Somerset\u2019s remarkable win was the story of the day: the south-west marches onward, 26 points clear. Thanks so much for your company, have a lovely evening. Goodnight. And they shake hands here at Guildford. Huge congratulations to the groundstaff who got this game going after torrential rain at various points during the day. They\u2019re back on at Guildford, with 26.3 overs left. I\u2019m going to write up now, but just to let you know that Godleman and Lace have beaten the previous record of 192 for the second wicket for Derbyshire against Glamorgan, and the record for any wicket against Glamorgan -247- set by Adrian Rollins and Mike May at Chesterfield in 1997. Despite Morkel\u2019s best efforts, this is bedding down for a draw. Ah, the umpires are even looking at their light metres. They\u2019re off. Yorkshire 24 for 0 and I suspect that\u2019s that. Fifty for Chris Dent at Arundel. Gloucestershire 99 for two. And possibly a degree or two of warmth. Tea at Swansea, where Godleman and Lace are both heading towards 150. Derby 355 for two, just 39 behind. One day left in this game. While watching Morne Morkel pull on his big long-sleeved jumper walking down to the boundary, I\u2019ve realised why Surrey\u2019s jumpers don\u2019t have names on. Yorkshire\u2019s are made out that acrylic stuff, Surrey are in proper woollies. I take it all back. Very careful start here by the Lyth and Fraine. Watchful waiting. 8/0. We now have three live matches, at Arundel, Guildford and Swansea. Lyth, unbelievably in short sleeves, watches, plays it, leaves it and survives. Yorkshire 0 for 0. From the railway end, Matt Dunn. Here we go again. And opening the bowling from the pavilion end, is Morne Morkel. A fantastic catch, that I missed, while looking up Linden Lea by The Full English as recommended by Paul Edwards. Yorkshire all out 148, following-on and we\u2019re all destined to sit in this damp, damp tent for a while longer. Yorkshire trail by 165, having lost all their wickets for 97 runs. Morkel 4 for 43 and a sensational catch. Rikki Clarke 3 for 35. Jordan Clark on debut 2 for 37. 38 overs left in the day. A sniff for Surrey, a sniff Somerset have won by ten wickets! Top of the table and going higher. Match abandoned at Trent Bridge. Duanne\u2019s hip doesn\u2019t stop him stroking with the greatest nonchalance a cover-drive to the green seats at the tree-lined side of the ground. Jordan Thompson heaves Rikki Clarke over the hospitality tents for six. Yorkshire 128 for nine. And at Canterbury, Somerset are nearly there - ten to win, ten wickets in hand. Eight becomes nine at Guildford. Ben Coad b Morkel for a big fat lonely nought. Yorkshire 114 for nine. And Duanne Olivier belies his hip injury to walk out at No.11. Morkel has the ball. This shan\u2019t take long. Plaudits, peacocks, golden trumpets! Tom Lace, on loan to Derbyshire from Middlesex, has just made his maiden first class century for the club. And that\u2019s a mammoth partnership he\u2019s put on there with Billy Godleman (114 not out): 215 and counting. Derby 289 for two. And it\u2019s catching. At Guildford, Steven Patterson is, after a huge appeal, caught Foakes b Rikki Clarke for six. Yorkies 109 for 8 and not with even a sniff of the follow-on Kent 59 all out. Gregory five for 21; Coverton three for 7. Somerset need 30 to win. Make that 59 for nine....Craig Overton 3 for seven. T\u2019was a good day to be a fast bowler. The old campaigner falls. Stevens lbw Overton 10. Kent 59 for eight, a lead of 29. Pitch looks ok on this bit of film.... is it the bitterly cold wind and toe-numbing temperatures? Or the deadening effect of too much time in the dressing-room. Kent lead now 25. Kent 44 for seven - Gregory four for nine. The lead is 14 at Canterbury, and at Guildford, Surrey come out chomping at the bit for those bonus points and maybe more. At the very last, we have some cricket. Is anyone at Canterbury? Did you do the ritual stare at the pitch? What did it look like - the moon? Gregory now 3-9, two catches for big Craig Overton. I was just about to say Dickson\u2019s still in, but he aint. Kent 39 for six. Coverton with the wicket. er.... 39 for five.... Another one down: 37 for four and the lead is seven. Bell Drummond gone. That Gregory can do no wrong. Here\u2019s the first wicket. Kent 32 for three. Somerset, will they? Can they? The umpires go out to look at the covers, held down by a selection of plastic containers. They walk back. Ho, hum. Here\u2019s the live stream from Canterbury Rain delay at Arundel. now. Hey-ho. Kent are batting! Come on, make it interesting. Play due to start at 2pm at Swansea and 1.45 at Canterbury. It is still drizzing here. Lunch at Arundel. No play yet in the World Cup match and no news from the England women\u2019s game v West Indies. Match abandoned at New Road. On the topic of exclamation marks (BTL), I\u2019ve undergone a bit of a volte-face. I used to hate them but then found when dealing with people you didn\u2019t really know, eg other parents at your children\u2019s school over whatsapp text etc, that they were useful. Otherwise it was sometimes unclear if you were being passive aggressive etc. But then I\u2019ve also developed a liking for emojis, so perhaps there is no hope. Guildford: Surrey 313 v Yorkshire 95-7 (Morkel 3-27) Arundel: Sussex v Gloucestershire: 96-2 Grace Road: Leicestershire 33-3 v Middlesex: Match abandoned. Draw. Chester-le-Street: Durham 253 v Northants 254-6. Match abandoned. Draw. Canterbury: Kent 139 and 24-2 v Somerset 169. No play before lunch New Road: Worcestershire 98 v LAncs 110-3. No play before lunch Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan 394 v Derby 221-2. Inspection 1.30pm World Cup: India v New Zealand. Inspection 1.30pm Gloucestershire pootling along at Arundel, 74 for two in a game that is probably going nowhere. Chris Dent 44 not out. It\u2019s brightening up again at Guildford where we\u2019re destined for an in-out day, until Surrey have nicked those final bowling points. Some spots of rain fall and the Yorkshire batsmen are walking off before you can say 95 for seven. An inspection at 12.30 in the World Cup game. No play before lunch at Canterbury, and an inspection at 1.10 at Swansea. Jordan Clark -hat-trick specialist - takes two wickets in two balls on his debut for Surrey in the Championship. It seems the restart came too soon for Yorkshire. Five balls later, Rikki Clarke adds a wicket to his two catches. Kohler-Cadmore turned around by one that hits his hip on the way through and is caught by Foakes. Yorkshire 93 for seven. Gloucestershire are 41 for one at Arundel. No play anywhere else, but the wagtails are happy at Guildford. Dab, dab, dab. And they\u2019re off... No hat-trick! The rain gets heavier. Jordan Clark replaces Morne Morkel from the pavilion end and we go again. Jonathan Tattersall has a wild slash, and is caught by Rikki Clarke at first slip. Yorkies 93 for five. And next ball!!! Bess out first ball, caught Clarke again. 93 for six Hat-trick ball! OF course he\u2019s done it before - against Yorkshire last year. Root, Williamson, Bairstow .... A bit of Morne Morkel. Fifteen pace run-up, green-soled shoes, terrifying. At Arundel, Sussex declared and Gloucestershire have already lost a wicket.Miles Hammond for 5, bowled Ollie Robinson. Just bonus points you say? Leaning brilliantly caught one-handedly by Ben Foakes. Follow on target 164. Three wickets in 12 balls for Morkel. Yorkies 79 for four. A second for Morkel - Fraine drove, unwisely, and was caught behind. Yorkshire heading towards being in a bit of a pickle, 75 for three. Just to recap, only play at Guildford and Arundel so far. It\u2019s match abandoned at Grace Road. Start delayed at Swansea, and prospects of play \u201cnot great\u201d at New Road. Better news, I\u2019ve been to the Woodbridge Road cafe. Some of you might like to consider the mega breakfast challenge. \u201cA ten egg omelette filled with cheddar cheese and beans, four sausages, four slices of bacon, four hash browns, saute potatoes, bubble and squeak, two slices of fried bread and unlimited tea, coffee or squash.\u201d If you eat it in 30 minutes you get your money back. Astonishingly, play starts on time at Guildford, and to the very first ball of the day, Gary Ballance fends a lifter from Morne Morkel to gully. Yorkshire 58 for two. And yet... I see some lightness through the Surrey cloud. Morne Morkel and Jordan Clark are doing big fast bowler things with stretchy black elastics and everyone is throwing heavy balls about. Yorkies are in a huddle over t\u2019other side of the ground and a spectator potters past. Here\u2019s Matthew Engel\u2019s take on Australia v Pakistan yesterday. And a fascinating read here on doping in cricket by Tim Wigmore. \u201cThe thought that the rules on anti-doping aren\u2019t the same for every country in world cricket is bizarre - frankly it amazes me,\u201d said the senior medical official. \u201cThe fact that only the top eight are subject to that is a huge surprise. Especially when you\u2019ve got 10 playing in the World Cup - they\u2019re not playing by the same rules.\u201d Delayed start at Canterbury, and things don\u2019t look too hot at Grace Road. At Trent Bridge, India are due to play New Zealand. Adam Collins has driven through torrential pourings to find a kind of truce. No rain.... yet. The start will probably be delayed but it might happen. Keep an eye on things here. From Guildford where it is grey, damp, drizzly and sad. Barrels of beer sitting fatly undrunk and a refreshment tent full of lovely people, home-made cake, but no spectators. But it is not as bad as at Chester-le-Street where they\u2019ve called it off already. Which leaves us with four games, at Guildford, Canterbury, New Road and Grace Road theoretically going into their last day, and two games, at Swansea and Arundel going into their third.",

Mr Johnson says he is focused on achieving a deal, but he\u2019s very clear that he doesn\u2019t have any reservations about leaving without a deal, and I have been very, very clear about my position on a no-deal Brexit given how difficult that would be for Scotland.</p> \n   <p>We are in a very challenging circumstance and it may not be possible to deliver a deal, certainly a deal within the timescale Mr Johnson has set, which is a very, very tight timescale to get a deal through, not just with the EU, but with parliament, by 31 October. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Revealing he had voted by proxy for Matt Hancock, the health secretary, in the first round of voting today, Mundell said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m not \u2018anybody but Boris\u2019 in the sense of seeking to stop Mr Johnson.

Obviously Mr Johnson is the frontrunner. I didn\u2019t support him in today\u2019s ballot and I won\u2019t be supporting him in the future part of this process.</p> \n   <p>But it would be complacent to assume that he is just going to win the exercise.

As an ardent Brexiter known for his controversial remarks on ethnic minorities and women, his previously messy private life and privileged upbringing, a Johnson premiership could be readily converted into greater support for the Scottish National party and independence.<br></p> \n  <p>Mundell claimed Johnson was a \u201cstaunch unionist and he\u2019s committed to keeping our United Kingdom together\u201d.

That is an unconstitutional, improper, really disturbing suggestion that you try to get something through by locking the doors of parliament. Answer us.

I guarantee you, if he were to try, I and every other member of parliament will sit across the road in Methodist Central Hall and we will hold our own session of parliament and we will bring him down, because you do not, ever, lock the doors on parliament in this country, or in any other country with any respect in the world.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Dominic Raab is the Brexiter leadership candidate who has publicly floated the idea of proroguing parliament to facilitate a no-deal Brexit (because sending MPs away from the House of Commons would stop them legislating to prevent a no-deal departure). Raab is not actively advocating this, but he says it would be a mistake to rule it out.</p> \n  <p>Johnson has said he is not attracted to the idea of using prorogation in this way, but today\u2019s Times reports that, in private talks with Tory Brexiters, he has not ruled out the idea. Here\u2019s an extract from the <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/boris-johnson-won-t-rule-out-suspending-parliament-3v2mcjbcz\">Times story (paywall)</a>.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The former foreign secretary was said, however, to have privately assured the hard-Brexit European Research Group (ERG) of backbenchers that he would not explicitly rule it out.</p> \n   <p>Some Brexiteers have urged the next prime minister to end the parliamentary session \u2013 known as proroguing \u2013 so MPs are unable to stop a no-deal exit from the EU on October 31, which would require the Queen\u2019s permission.</p> \n   <p>\u201cHe\u2019s told the ERG he won\u2019t take prorogation off the table and that he\u2019s signed up to their plan for a \u2018managed no-deal\u2019,\u201d a source on another campaign said.</p> \n   <p>A senior Brexiteer confirmed last night that Mr Johnson had discussed the option of suspending parliament at a private meeting late last week.

For him not to get on the final ballot, he would have to start losing quite a number of MPs, which is almost unthinkable. Of course, in a campaign among the Tory membership, he could be overtaken by a surprise outsider, but this will be a short campaign (not a months-long contest as in 2005, which allowed David Cameron to come from behind) and postal ballots will be going out soon after the parliamentary phase of the process ends next week. In postal ballots, people often vote early, and there is clear evidence that a majority of members back Johnson. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jun/13/conservative-leadership-tory-mps-start-voting-for-new-leader-live-news?page=with:block-5d020be58f08bf2020cafa1c#block-5d020be58f08bf2020cafa1c\"> 9.46am</a>.)</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Jeremy Hunt came second, but it was a poor second (he had fewer than half the votes Johnson had) and he was only six votes ahead of Michael Gove, in third place. </strong>Hunt had six more votes that he had declared supporters this morning, and Gove three more. The main interest over the next week will be which of those two wins the contest to take on Johnson. Hunt is probably the favourite, but the two men are close enough for Gove to still be in the running.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dominic Raab, who came fourth, Sajid Javid, who came fifth, and Matt Hancock, who came sixth, are probably all now effectively out of contention</strong>. Not one of them reached 33 votes \u2013 the threshold that will be needed to survive after the next ballot on Tuesday. They may decide to fight on (there are 30 votes from candidates who have been eliminated to be redistributed) but they will all have to decide whether it makes sense to continue, or whether they would do better packing in now and pledging support to a rival camp (on the basis that the sooner one gets on board, the better the rewards might be). Raab\u2019s campaign was probably doomed as soon as Johnson tied up a large chunk of the European Research Group vote. Javid, who holds one of the top four jobs in cabinet and at one point was seen as a favourite to succeed Theresa May, will be wondering where it all went wrong. (\u201cStrong fifth\u201d, to quote one of his supporters \u2013 see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jun/13/conservative-leadership-tory-mps-start-voting-for-new-leader-live-news?page=with:block-5d0241488f080adae48975b6#block-5d0241488f080adae48975b6\"> 1.28pm</a> \u2013 is an oxymoron.) And Hancock was always a longshot.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Rory Stewart will probably be pleasantly surprised with this performance, given he is standing in a Tory leadership contest on a non-Tory platform. </strong>This result will give him a slot in the Channel 4 hustings on Sunday. His non-conventional, bohemian campaigning style has struck a chord with the liberal commentariat (aka Twitter), but it is hard to see him picking up many more votes.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Andrea Leadsom, Mark Harper and Esther McVey have all been eliminated, coming 8th, 9th and 10th respectively</strong>. This is no great surprise, but the fact that the only two women in the contest did so badly does not say a lot for the party\u2019s egalitarianism. Only three years ago, Leadsom was the runner-up in the leadership contest, and today\u2019s result confirms how much her political stock has fallen since then. Many of the Leadsom and McVey (20) votes will probably go to Johnson.<br></li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-13T13:51:32.592Z\">at 2.51pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d02428d8f08ec09b0d194ee\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/poppy-noor\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-13T12:35:52.860Z\">1.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As the results were announced, I was one of the people made to sit longingly in the corridor, as I wasn\u2019t signed up to go in.<br><br>But I did as a result get to watch the results go live in the corridor with an influential Boris Johnson supporter.

Here\u2019s an extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Between 2011\u201312 and 2016\u201317, median incomes grew at a rate of 1.6% a year \u2013 faster than the 1.2% growth rate seen immediately before the recession (2002\u201303 to 2007\u201308).</p> \n   <p>However, median household income growth stalled in 2017\u201318, making it only the fourth year (and second non-recession year) in the last 30 where median income did not grow. This stalling is in large part because real earnings fell, due to a rise in inflation following the depreciation of the pound after the UK voted to leave the European Union. Rising inflation meant that the freeze in working-age benefits hit poorer households harder than if inflation had not risen.</p> \n   <p>All this means that median income in 2017\u201318 was only 5.6% higher than it was 10 years earlier, before the great recession.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d0215bc8f0806892b8e1b92\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-13T09:23:25.544Z\">10.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Jeremy Hunt has just marched in, looking quite purposefully (and not wearing morning dress - see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jun/13/conservative-leadership-tory-mps-start-voting-for-new-leader-live-news?page=with:block-5d02088a8f0806892b8e1b2f#block-5d02088a8f0806892b8e1b2f\"> 9.30am),</a> with Dominic Raab, another leadership candidate immediately behind him.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d02139e8f0806892b8e1b82\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-13T09:13:06.566Z\">10.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Sajid Javid has voted.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d0213078f0806892b8e1b7d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-13T09:12:51.340Z\">10.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here is a Sky News tally of declared supporters for each candidate.

As the Press Association reports, Javid told the Today programme he had still not received a proper explanation as to why was the only senior cabinet minister not to be invited to the dinner at Buckingham Palace. Asked why he was not there, he told the programme:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I don\u2019t know. I have asked. I was just told that normally home secretaries aren\u2019t invited. So I don\u2019t know ...</p> \n   <p>I don\u2019t like it. It is odd. My office did ask No 10 and they said \u2018no\u2019. You\u2019d have to ask someone from No 10 why they made that decision.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Previously Javid criticised Trump after he tweeted his support for the right-wing Britain First group. Javid said the president was endorsing the views of \u201ca vile, hate-filled racist organisation that hates me and people like me\u201d. </p> \n  <p>Asked on the Today programme if he thought his exclusion was due to his Muslim background, Javid said: \u201cI am not saying that at all.

The entire election will be a relatively long-drawn out process - we have got several more rounds of voting in Westminster, hustings, TV debates, and the membership ballot to look forward to - but today is going to clarify matters a bit. This is what we will find out.</p> \n  <p><strong>1) Who\u2019s out? </strong>There are currently 10 candidates in the race. At least one of them will definitely drop out today - the person with the fewest votes - but under new rules introduced by the Conservative 1922 Committee any candidate with fewer than 17 votes (5% of the parliamentary party) will also be out. Mark Harper, Rory Stewart, Esther McVey and Andrea Leadsom all look as though they will struggle to hit this target, and so by the end of the day the field could be down to six.</p> \n  <p><strong>2) Is Boris Johnson as far ahead as everyone thinks? </strong>The ConservativeHome website has been keeping a tally of how many MP supporters each MP has and it has Johnson well ahead, on 83, followed by Jeremy Hunt (37), Michael Gove (34), Dominic Raab (23), Sajid Javid (19) and Matthew Hancock (17). But - astonishing as the idea might seem - it is the case that occasionally MPs do not tell the truth about how they will vote in a secret ballot. Yesterday the politics academic <strong>Philip Cowley</strong> summed it up like this on Twitter.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/philipjcowley/status/1138728026353483777\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">If I was a Conservative MP, I'm fairly certain by now I'd have pledged my support to Boris Johnson - because he'll probably win and I want a job - but I doubt I'd actually vote for him.<br><br>I am a shit, yes, but then the parliamentary party contains a fair few of them.</p>\u2014 Philip Cowley (@philipjcowley) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/philipjcowley/status/1138728026353483777?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 12, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Today we will find out if there are sizeable numbers of Tories doing a Cowley.</p> \n  <p><strong>3) Who are Johnson\u2019s main rivals?</strong> Hunt looks like the candidate most likely to join Johnson on the final ballot but, according to the ConservativeHome numbers, 75 Tory MPs have not declared for anyone and Hunt is only 20 declared votes ahead of Matthew Hancock. The results being announced at 1pm may well rank candidates in a different order to what people currently expect. Michael Gove and Dominic Raab have been struggling this week, and Sajid Javid seems to have had some last-minute momentum. By the end of today we should have a much better idea as to who might bag the number two slot.</p> \n  <p><strong>4) Where will second preference votes start to go? </strong>At least one candidate, and perhaps up to four, will be forced out at lunchtime. It is possible that other candidates might pass the 17-vote threshold but decide to drop out anyway. Who will these people support? And where who will their supporters back? (Not always the same thing.) We may start to find out this afternoon.</p> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> \n  <p><em>10am: </em>Voting starts in the first round ballot for the Conservative leadership contest. Conservative MPs vote in a Commons committee room.

      "bodyText": "Three candidates including Andrea Leadsom and Esther McVey have been eliminated from the race to become Britain\u2019s next prime minister after the first round of voting among Conservative MPs. The former foreign secretary Boris Johnson comfortably topped the poll as expected, securing the support of 114 of his Tory colleagues \u2013 well above the 105 he would need to guarantee a place in the final two. Johnson and another six candidates \u2013 Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Dominic Raab, Sajid Javid, Matt Hancock and Rory Stewart \u2013 remain in the contest, but there is speculation that some of them might withdraw before the next round of voting, due on Tuesday next week. In tweets posted after the results were announced, Javid and Hancock sounded least committed to staying in the race. Here are the results in full: Rory Stewart, who has been unexpectedly catapulted into the next round of the contest, vowed he would set up \u201can alternative parliament\u201d should the frontrunner, Boris Johnson, suspend parliament to pursue a no-deal Brexit. Downing Street has said it is \u201ccategorically untrue\u201d to say Sajid Javid was not invited to the state banquet for Donald Trump because of his Muslim background. The denial came after Javid, the home secretary, suggested he was not convinced by the official explanation for him not being invited, which was that home secretaries are not automatically on the list. Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has written to all the remaining leadership candidates asking them to pledge to keep reducing the national debt every year. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. The Conservative party has said there will be 16 hustings, in every part of the UK, once the parliamentary stage of the contest is over. It said: There will be 16 leadership hustings hosted in every region and nation of the UK. The first hustings will take place in Birmingham on Saturday 22 June. The final hustings will take place in London in the week commencing 15 July. There will also be an opportunity for the public to question the final two candidates online during the hustings period. Conservative party members should receive postal ballots between 6 and 8 July. The result of the ballot will be announced in the week commencing 22 July. The campaign spending limit for each candidate is \u00a3150,000, commencing from 7 June. David Mundell, the Scotland secretary, has said he will never vote for Boris Johnson as Tory leader, fearing Johnson\u2019s apparent willingness to force through a no-deal Brexit by 31 October makes him a political liability. Mundell told reporters in Edinburgh, as he officially took possession of a new multimillion-pound UK government office, that he also believed it would be extremely difficult to deliver Brexit by that deadline. I want to see someone who is focused on achieving a deal in relation to Brexit. Mr Johnson says he is focused on achieving a deal, but he\u2019s very clear that he doesn\u2019t have any reservations about leaving without a deal, and I have been very, very clear about my position on a no-deal Brexit given how difficult that would be for Scotland. We are in a very challenging circumstance and it may not be possible to deliver a deal, certainly a deal within the timescale Mr Johnson has set, which is a very, very tight timescale to get a deal through, not just with the EU, but with parliament, by 31 October. Revealing he had voted by proxy for Matt Hancock, the health secretary, in the first round of voting today, Mundell said: I\u2019m not \u2018anybody but Boris\u2019 in the sense of seeking to stop Mr Johnson. It\u2019s just I have been clear in the past I wouldn\u2019t support him in a leadership election. Mundell denied ever saying he would not serve in a Johnson cabinet \u2013 contradicting previous statements to the media \u2013 but implied he believed Johnson may not win in the final round and could yet come unstuck as he faces tougher scrutiny. We\u2019re a long way from the conclusion of this race. Obviously Mr Johnson is the frontrunner. I didn\u2019t support him in today\u2019s ballot and I won\u2019t be supporting him in the future part of this process. But it would be complacent to assume that he is just going to win the exercise. I think it\u2019s very important as we go through the television debates next week, as we go through the interaction with members, that all candidates are held to account, their positions [are] challenged and they make robust defences and set out further details of their policies. Johnson is widely seen by the Scottish Tories as a highly problematic choice. As an ardent Brexiter known for his controversial remarks on ethnic minorities and women, his previously messy private life and privileged upbringing, a Johnson premiership could be readily converted into greater support for the Scottish National party and independence. Mundell claimed Johnson was a \u201cstaunch unionist and he\u2019s committed to keeping our United Kingdom together\u201d. But challenged by the Guardian about Johnson\u2019s previous attacks on the Barnett formula, which allows Scotland to spend \u00a31,600 more per head on public services, Mundell said: There is no suggestion he is coming into this race with a view to changing the Barnett formula or changing any of the arrangements that currently exist in relation to the devolved settlement. Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative chair of the foreign affairs select committee, voted for Michael Gove because he thinks the \u201cprocess is going to require some compromise\u201d. He explained: One of the problems Theresa May had was she voted for remain and never gained the trust of Brexiters. It\u2019s like Nixon going to China, somebody who voted for Brexit can get that compromise in the party. Only two candidates can do that and I think Gove is easily the cleverest and his achievements in the various departments as secretary of state has demonstrated that. Here are the next key dates in the Conservative leadership contest. Tomorrow 1pm: Deadline for candidates who want to announce they are withdrawing from the contest. Sunday 16 June: Channel 4 News broadcasts a hustings for the candidates, chaired by Krishnan Guru-Murthy. Boris Johnson is not expected to participate, but other candidates, including Michael Gove and Rory Stewart, have said they are keen to be there. Monday 17 June: Second round of hustings organised by the 1922 Committee, starting at 3pm. These take place in private. Tuesday 18 June: The second ballot takes place between 3pm and 5pm, with the result announced at about 6pm. The candidate coming last will drop out, as well as any candidate receiving fewer than 33 votes. At 8pm, Emily Maitlis will chair a BBC hustings. Wednesday 19 June: The third ballot will take place, with voting between 3pm and 5pm and the result due at about 6pm. The candidate coming last will drop out. Thursday 20 June: Two further ballots will take place, if needed, the first in the morning, with the results announced at about 1pm, and the second in the afternoon, with the results announced at about 6pm. By the end of Thursday, the 1922 Committee hopes to have whittled the list down to two for the ballot of party members. Week beginning Monday 22 July: The winner of the election is due to be announced this week. The Conservative party has not yet said exactly when that will be, but Wednesday 24 July is likely to be the new leader\u2019s first PMQs, or Theresa May\u2019s last. The Conservative party has its problems \u2013 Rory Stewart came close to predicting civil war earlier (see 3.14pm) \u2013 but at least it knows what it is called. Change UK, the new party that started life as the 11-strong Independent Group of MPs, has just put out a press release saying it is changing its identity again. It is now applying to the Electoral Commission to be known as \u201cThe Independent Group for Change\u201d. It is doing this to avert a legal challenge from the campaigning organisation Change.org. Here are two tweets on the Tory leadership and privilege. From Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall From the Times\u2019 Esther Webber Sir John Major, the former Conservative prime minister, was speaking at a Chatham House event this morning, and he was scathing about the suggestion that a new PM might prorogue parliament to prevent it blocking a no-deal Brexit. These Brexiters contemplating this idea were guilty of \u201chypocrisy on a gold-plated stand\u201d, he said. He seemed to be referring in particular to Dominic Raab and Boris Johnson, and to Jacob Rees-Mogg, who was the first Brexiter to float a version of this idea. Major told the audience: When you get people suggesting that we prorogue parliament because parliament may take a different view from a particular faction in the House of Commons, then you are heading in a very dangerous territory. If I look back through British history, then I cannot imagine Mr Disraeli, Mr Gladstone, Mr Churchill or Mrs Thatcher, even on their most difficult moments, saying, \u2018Let us put parliament aside while I carry through this difficult policy that part of my party disagrees with.\u2019 It is fundamentally unconstitutional. And to hear that argument come from people who in the Brexit debate talked about the sovereignty of parliament being at stake, it is not only fundamentally distasteful, it is hypocrisy on a gold-plated stand. I don\u2019t think that that could possibly be allowed to stand. I don\u2019t think the House of Commons will allow it to stand. And, to be absolutely frank, I don\u2019t think anybody who proposes that, or even lets it flit through their mind for a second, has any understanding of what parliament is about, what sovereignty is about, what leadership is about or what the United Kingdom is about. And the sooner the House of Commons stamp on this idea, absolutely, comprehensively and forever, the better. The Tory MP Ken Clarke also said he agreed with Rory Stewart\u2019s comment about how, if Boris Johnson were to suspend parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit, MPs would \u201cbring him down\u201d. (See 2.32pm.) Clarke said: I agree with that \u2026 There would be absolute outrage if a new prime minister suddenly decided because he didn\u2019t get a majority in parliament for a policy that he would close parliament down and use dictatorial powers \u2026 It\u2019s a bizarre suggestion. Clarke said that although we have an uncodified constitution, it is nonetheless clear that governments should only pursue policies for which they have parliament\u2019s approval. Just four of the 11 members of the foreign affairs select committee went on its road trip to Northern Ireland today. Four of the five Conservative MPs and three of the five Labour MPs did not turn up in Armagh, where the first of two outreach events with local communities are taking place. It is not clear why so few turned up, but the Conservative leadership vote was not a barrier, as the Tory committee chair, Tom Tugendhat, was able to attend and take part in the ballot by arranging a proxy vote. The committee is meeting community groups, representatives from local businesses and elected public representatives. Among those not attending are the Brexiter Priti Patel and Andrew Rosindell, who has said the stalemate over the border is a \u201cred herring from day one\u201d and the only way to resolve it is through bilateral talks between the UK and Ireland. Rosindell made the comments in Ireland last month, when he attended a session of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, which he co-chairs. The Conservative former chancellor and veteran pro-European Ken Clarke has accused Boris Johnson of not knowing what he wants, and said some Conservatives fear the idea of him being prime minister. In an interview, he said: Some are extremely fearful about the idea that he becomes prime minister. This isn\u2019t some TV reality show \u2026 We\u2019re not choosing the winner of the Great [British] Bake Off \u2013 we\u2019re talking about government and policies. The father of the house, who supported Rory Stewart in the leadership vote today, said Johnson muddles through, often forgetting what he believes in from one day to the next. He doesn\u2019t have any policies, certainly none that are consistent from day to day in the way he puts them. I don\u2019t actually think he knows what he would do to get us out of the Brexit crisis. He doesn\u2019t always say the same thing, partly because he doesn\u2019t always remember what he said the day before. He tends to work day to day and just get his way through it \u2013 he\u2019s not a man who\u2019s interested in detail. Here is more from the Rory Stewart interview with Sky News quoted earlier. See 1.42pm.) Stewart said Boris Johnson would be acting like Charles I if he prorogued parliament to facilitate a no-deal Brexit. King Charles\u2019s confrontations with parliament led to the civil war. Somebody who attempted to subvert our constitution, our liberties, our parliament, this place, who dared to stand as prime minister and claim that they could lock the doors on parliament, would not deserve to be prime minister. And this parliament would meet, whether he locked the doors or not, and we would bring him down. If he locked the doors of parliament, he would be doing it because he knew that parliament was entirely and completely against the central plank of his policy. And he would try to stop parliament from bringing him down by not allowing parliament to sit. That\u2019s what Charles I did. That led to very, very disturbing things in this country. I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t mean it. I\u2019m sure, like his taxation policy and his employer national insurance policy, he just hasn\u2019t thought it through. So please think it through. Stewart said it was important for politicians to be straight with people. He said: I\u2019m very worried if [Johnson] will not tell us what he stands for. Because in the end we have had too much politics where people don\u2019t trust politicians, people have been afraid to speak about reality, to be straight with people. People said, when I began this campaign, that you are never going to get anywhere because you are being straight about parliament, about the problems in Europe. People said you are not going to get anywhere because you are not making tax and spending pledges. What I have discovered is it\u2019s immensely popular to be straight with people, and that\u2019s why I think we can win this. Stewart said he was beginning to think he might just make it on to the final ballot of Tory members. Andrea Leadsom has tweeted this about her departure from the leadership race. My colleague Jessica Elgot has coined a new and very useful term for Tory MPs who back Rory Stewart \u2013 but are unwilling to come out and say so. Michael Gove, the environment secretary, who came third, says it\u2019s \u201call to play for\u201d. He is probably the best debater in the House of Commons, and seems to be looking forward to the Channel 4 hustings on Sunday. And this is from Dominic Raab, who came fourth today. These are from Mark Harper, who was eliminated from the contest today. The odds on Boris Johnson becoming the next prime minister are now 1/5, down from 4/7 this morning, the betting website Oddschecker says. That\u2019s an implied probability of 83.3% that he will win the Conservative leadership contest. Here is the Green MP, Caroline Lucas, on the results of the first round of voting. This is what Rory Stewart, the international development secretary who is standing to become Conservative leader, said about bringing down Boris Johnson if he tried to prorogue parliament to facilitate a no-deal Brexit. Asked what he would do, Stewart told Sky News: Number one, let\u2019s get Boris to be straight. Does he or does he not consider locking the doors of parliament to be acceptable? That is an unconstitutional, improper, really disturbing suggestion that you try to get something through by locking the doors of parliament. Answer us. I\u2019ve been asking for a week, \u2018Boris, are you going to lock the doors of parliament?\u2019 If so, tell people, because we want to know what kind of leader or prime minister we are voting for. But he won\u2019t be able to. I guarantee you, if he were to try, I and every other member of parliament will sit across the road in Methodist Central Hall and we will hold our own session of parliament and we will bring him down, because you do not, ever, lock the doors on parliament in this country, or in any other country with any respect in the world. Dominic Raab is the Brexiter leadership candidate who has publicly floated the idea of proroguing parliament to facilitate a no-deal Brexit (because sending MPs away from the House of Commons would stop them legislating to prevent a no-deal departure). Raab is not actively advocating this, but he says it would be a mistake to rule it out. Johnson has said he is not attracted to the idea of using prorogation in this way, but today\u2019s Times reports that, in private talks with Tory Brexiters, he has not ruled out the idea. Here\u2019s an extract from the Times story (paywall). The former foreign secretary was said, however, to have privately assured the hard-Brexit European Research Group (ERG) of backbenchers that he would not explicitly rule it out. Some Brexiteers have urged the next prime minister to end the parliamentary session \u2013 known as proroguing \u2013 so MPs are unable to stop a no-deal exit from the EU on October 31, which would require the Queen\u2019s permission. \u201cHe\u2019s told the ERG he won\u2019t take prorogation off the table and that he\u2019s signed up to their plan for a \u2018managed no-deal\u2019,\u201d a source on another campaign said. A senior Brexiteer confirmed last night that Mr Johnson had discussed the option of suspending parliament at a private meeting late last week. Another said: \u201cI didn\u2019t hear him rule it out.\u201d The idea of getting a shadow parliament to sit in Methodist Central Hall is not as novel an idea as it sounds. In 2002, the then Labour MP Graham Allen investigated the idea of hiring Church House at Westminster for an informal recall of parliament to discuss the threat of war with Iraq. In the event, Tony Blair did recall parliament, and Allen\u2019s plan was dropped. Here is my colleague Rafael Behr on Boris Johnson. And here is an extract. One of the two Johnsons served as mayor of London from 2008-2016. He has liberal, metropolitan instincts \u2013 broadly pro-immigration, old-fashioned in his use of idiom, but a moderniser at heart. Then there is 2016-2019 Johnson, figurehead of the Vote Leave campaign, the ultimate Brexit-booster. He is a more aggressive, divisive figure \u2013 a partisan of nationalistic culture wars who has consorted with Steve Bannon. Both Johnsons are dispensing wild promises to Tory MPs behind closed doors. The self-styled \u201cone-nation\u201d Conservatives and rightwing ultras each seem to think the other side is being taken for a ride, which suggests they all are. Matt Hancock surpassed expectations, a spokesman for his campaign said. The spokesman went on: MPs have responded well to Matt\u2019s energetic and positive campaign. His pro-business message, his focus on taking the fight to Corbyn and the Lib Dems, not just the Brexit party, and his argument that the Tory party \u201cneed a leader for the future, not just for now\u201d, has gone down well with colleagues. Here is a graph with the results. Here is Jeremy Hunt commenting on the result. \u201cSerious leader\u201d is, of course, code for \u201cnot Boris Johnson\u201d. This is from Rory Stewart. Here is a Labour response to the Rory Stewart interview. Rory Stewart has just given an extraordinary interview, PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield and BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham report. I will post the quotes in a moment. Rory Stewart told BBC News he was \u201ccompletely over the moon\u201d at securing 19 votes, saying a poll on the ConservativeHome website putting him as the second choice behind Boris Johnson among Tory members \u201cmust have been what turned around the final few\u201d. Asked how he could build on the still relatively low number, to reach the 33 needed to progress past the second round on Tuesday, he said: You build on it by just saying this message, which is about being radical, about being brave in the centre ground, about getting out and listening to people, is extraordinarily popular. None of these other candidates at the moment are really tapping into this. Stewart added: What I\u2019m discovering is that a Conservative message, delivered properly, and if you listen in the right way, is incredibly popular, and that\u2019s what I have to get across to colleagues. On Brexit, Stewart said he wanted to get across his message by asking colleagues to focus \u201con the practical issues \u2013 how do we get this done\u201d, saying Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy was very hazy. Amber Rudd, who is backing Jeremy Hunt, denied that it was disappointing to see him so far behind Boris Johnson. \u201cNot at all,\u201d she told the BBC. \u201cHe came a good second, he got more than Matt and Saj combined, and that\u2019s what we were after \u2013 a clear lead in second place. It\u2019s only the first round, there\u2019s a few more rounds to go. I\u2019m delighted.\u201d While Johnson was well ahead, Rudd said that once the race was down to a final two, it would \u201cstart again\u201d in hustings to members, in which \u201canything can happen\u201d. Here are the key points: Boris Johnson is the runaway winner of the first round and is now looking unstoppable. With 114 votes, he is 31 ahead of the declared supporters he had this morning and well above the threshold of 105 he needs to ensure he makes it into the final two for the ballot of party members. For him not to get on the final ballot, he would have to start losing quite a number of MPs, which is almost unthinkable. Of course, in a campaign among the Tory membership, he could be overtaken by a surprise outsider, but this will be a short campaign (not a months-long contest as in 2005, which allowed David Cameron to come from behind) and postal ballots will be going out soon after the parliamentary phase of the process ends next week. In postal ballots, people often vote early, and there is clear evidence that a majority of members back Johnson. (See 9.46am.) Jeremy Hunt came second, but it was a poor second (he had fewer than half the votes Johnson had) and he was only six votes ahead of Michael Gove, in third place. Hunt had six more votes that he had declared supporters this morning, and Gove three more. The main interest over the next week will be which of those two wins the contest to take on Johnson. Hunt is probably the favourite, but the two men are close enough for Gove to still be in the running. Dominic Raab, who came fourth, Sajid Javid, who came fifth, and Matt Hancock, who came sixth, are probably all now effectively out of contention. Not one of them reached 33 votes \u2013 the threshold that will be needed to survive after the next ballot on Tuesday. They may decide to fight on (there are 30 votes from candidates who have been eliminated to be redistributed) but they will all have to decide whether it makes sense to continue, or whether they would do better packing in now and pledging support to a rival camp (on the basis that the sooner one gets on board, the better the rewards might be). Raab\u2019s campaign was probably doomed as soon as Johnson tied up a large chunk of the European Research Group vote. Javid, who holds one of the top four jobs in cabinet and at one point was seen as a favourite to succeed Theresa May, will be wondering where it all went wrong. (\u201cStrong fifth\u201d, to quote one of his supporters \u2013 see 1.28pm \u2013 is an oxymoron.) And Hancock was always a longshot. Rory Stewart will probably be pleasantly surprised with this performance, given he is standing in a Tory leadership contest on a non-Tory platform. This result will give him a slot in the Channel 4 hustings on Sunday. His non-conventional, bohemian campaigning style has struck a chord with the liberal commentariat (aka Twitter), but it is hard to see him picking up many more votes. Andrea Leadsom, Mark Harper and Esther McVey have all been eliminated, coming 8th, 9th and 10th respectively. This is no great surprise, but the fact that the only two women in the contest did so badly does not say a lot for the party\u2019s egalitarianism. Only three years ago, Leadsom was the runner-up in the leadership contest, and today\u2019s result confirms how much her political stock has fallen since then. Many of the Leadsom and McVey (20) votes will probably go to Johnson. As the results were announced, I was one of the people made to sit longingly in the corridor, as I wasn\u2019t signed up to go in. But I did as a result get to watch the results go live in the corridor with an influential Boris Johnson supporter. He laughed at Jeremy Hunt\u2019s result \u2013 43 votes \u2013 saying: \u201cWell, that\u2019s embarrassing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He said the Johnson team had not been bluffing when they estimated fewer votes for Boris (he got 114) but: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a bluff \u2013 his result was past expectations but obviously there is still a long way to go.\u201d Robert Halfon, the Harlow MP who is supporting Sajid Javid, said the home secretary had come in a \u201cstrong fifth place\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s all to play for,\u201d he told reporters after the vote. The public figures were 17 to 19 votes, and Sajid got 23. The momentum\u2019s building up. We\u2019ve got Ruth Davidson on our side, so we\u2019re really happy. Obviously Boris Johnson is well ahead, but Sajid has come up. He\u2019s clearly a very strong candidate, building up momentum all week. Esther McVey has issued this statement. I am extremely grateful to those people who voted for me in this election and to the fantastic team who have supported my campaign. I am pleased to have had a platform to make the case for blue-collar conservatism, a clean break from the EU and the need to invest money into schools, policing and a proper pay rise for our public sector workers. I will speak to the remaining candidates to see who is best placed to deliver on that programme. I wish the remaining candidates well and I hope that all Conservative MPs will unite behind whoever wins this contest, which is essential to prevent the disaster of a Marxist government. Whoever becomes the new leader will certainly receive my support. Gillan says seven candidates are eligible to go through to the next round, and three \u2013 Mark Harper, Andrea Leadsom and Esther McVey \u2013 have been eliminated. Cheryl Gillan, the joint acting chair of the 1922 Committee, is now reading out the results. All 313 Tory MPs voted, she says. There were no spoiled ballot papers. Boris Johnson \u2013 114 Jeremy Hunt \u2013 43 Michael Gove \u2013 37 Dominic Raab \u2013 27 Sajid Javid \u2013 23 Matt Hancock \u2013 20 Rory Stewart \u2013 19 Andrea Leadsom \u2013 11 Mark Harper \u2013 10 Esther McVey \u2013 9 From the Sunday Times\u2019 Tim Shipman From the New Statesman\u2019s Patrick Maguire From Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby While we are waiting for the results, you might enjoy this Twitter thread from my colleague Marina Hyde. It includes this tweet. A few minutes after Marina posted that, the Tory MP Johnny Mercer posted this. From the Sun\u2019s Steve Hawkes Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader and a Boris Johnson supporter, played down the prospect of Johnson taking part in the two televised hustings planned within the next week when he was interviewed on the BBC a few minutes ago. Duncan Smith said: My sense about the live television debates is I\u2019m not sure that they have any effect at all on MPs. MPs probably watch less television than most others do, and they tend to want to do this internally. Channel 4 News is planning a televised hustings for Sunday night, and the BBC has one planned for Tuesday. Duncan Smith said he would expect Johnson to take part in TV events once the contest gets down to the final two, and party members are voting. This is from BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham. And it\u2019s true, according to a source from one of the Tory leadership campaigns. This is from the Independent\u2019s John Rentoul, who has been running a sweepstake on the results. It is obviously a classy sweepstake if Rentoul is differentiating between the mean and median Boris Johnson score. In the committee corridor, Rory Stewart says he\u2019s got dozens of MPs who tell him he\u2019s their man, but they owe too much to other candidates who they\u2019ve served for in the past. Is he trying to win them over in the corridor in the final minutes? \u201cYes \u2013 by looking deeply into their eyes, I hope so,\u201d says Stewart. Stewart says he\u2019s polling higher than Boris and is the man to unite the country. He says liberal Twitter loves him so much because he speaks from the heart, he appeals to young people, people in cities. Asked if he\u2019d back Sajid Javid, the other candidate pitching himself as the change candidate who can appeal to new demographics, he says: \u201cI\u2019ll have to think long and hard about who I\u2019ll pick. He\u2019s a nice man.\u201d From my colleague Peter Walker Andrea Jenkyns has tweeted a picture of her toddler son. (Perhaps he should be standing. At least he\u2019s got an excuse for believing in unicorns.) It\u2019s 12pm. Voting has closed. The 1922 Committee is due to announce the results at about 1pm. Ken Clarke, the former chancellor and Tory pro-European, has just strolled down the committee corridor casually to find an eager Rory Stewart awaiting him. Stewart walked him down the corridor declaring to journalists: \u201cThis is the man who\u2019s going to save my life.\u201d Clarke is due to vote for Stewart, but the Stewart team were starting to worry that he might miss the 12pm deadline, when voting closes. Downing Street is pushing back against Sajid Javid\u2019s criticism of the fact he was not invited to Donald Trump\u2019s state banquet (see 9.37am), saying he was among many ministers to have been disappointed. Theresa May\u2019s spokesman told journalists this morning: This was a state banquet hosted by Her Majesty the Queen, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to discuss in public who did or did not ask to attend. But as with any state banquet, only a limited number of places are available to the government. A large number of ministers who expressed a wish to attend were not able to do so. No 10 are always wary about discussing royal-related matters on the record, but a Downing Street source said that the view of the White House or US embassy were \u201ccategorically not a factor\u201d in deciding to not invite Javid, the home secretary. There is, the source said, a \u201cfixed list\u201d of people who must attend, including the PM, chancellor and foreign secretary, and there were in total eight slots available for ministers. The source also pointed out that the then-home secretary at the time of Barack Obama\u2019s 2011 state visit \u2013 one T May \u2013 did not attend the banquet. There were, however, no answers on how the decision-making process took place, and its undeniable that the optics are not great when the one Muslim-heritage member of the cabinet, who occupies one of the great offices of state, cannot attend a state banquet for Trump, whose anti-Muslim view and policies are much chronicled. In the committee corridor David Davis is refusing to make any bets on who will win, lose, or to speculate on whom Theresa May might be voting for. The two went for a drink last night, he says - but he insists he wasn\u2019t campaigning for Dominic Raab when they met. Another committee corridor tweet from Andrea Leadsom David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, who is backing his successor and former chief of staff, Dominic Raab, also said he\u2019s convinced his man will make it through this first round - and suggested he will then shine in the TV debates. All the candidates should take part in the debates. The more you are clear about your policy, the stronger your mandate when you start as prime minister. The debates matter. I did five against David Cameron. Then the public know what you stand for \u2013 that\u2019s quite important. Blimey! Even the Conservative 1922 Committee is getting all jobsworth and surveillance state. David Davis, the former Brexit secretary (who was here shortly after the ballot opened at 10am) is backed and he said he was turned away from voting the first time because he did not have his parliamentary pass as identification. In the past MPs just turned up to vote, but now, under rules adopted for this contest, the committee is insisting they produce ID. Turning back to Sajid Javid and the decision not to invite him to the Trump state banquet (see 9.37am), Jacqui Smith, who was home secretary for two years under Labour, says she was always invited to state banquets. Javid says he was told by Number 10 that home secretaries normally aren\u2019t on the guest list. Andrea Leadsom has posted a Tory leadership selfie on Twitter. From the Sun\u2019s Matt Dathan The Evening Standard, which is edited by the former Tory chancellor George Osborne, has published an editorial today saying that there are two Boris Johnsons. It doesn\u2019t like the hardline Brexiter version, but it approves of his liberal doppelganger and could even endorse him. Here\u2019s an extract. Add all these questions together and it amounts to this: is Boris Johnson going to succumb to the temptation to divide and play the little Englander, as this newspaper felt he did over his promotion of Brexit? Or is he going to be the big-hearted, optimistic, liberal leader who this paper backed twice to be the mayor of London? If it\u2019s the latter, we can see ourselves backing him again. Many observers would argue the liberal version of Johnson vanished some time ago but Osborne, a key figure in the Conservative leadership team that promoted Johnson as a candidate for London mayor in 2008, seems reluctant to accept that. If Johnson had never become mayor, (with the backing of Osborne and David Cameron), it is hard to see how he would be favourite for next PM today. And Johnson has just come out, saying nothing to reporters - or shtum, as he might put it himself. Boris Johnson has just gone in, hands sunk in his jacket pockets. Journalists are not allowed to tweet pictures from the committee corridor \u2013 or, indeed, from many places on the parliamentary estate \u2013 but MPs seem to be allowed to get away with it. This is from the Conservative MP Robert Halfon. The Tory MP Sir David Amess has declared for Dominic Raab. I missed this from Rory Stewart earlier. We don\u2019t normally indulge in textual literary criticism on occasions like this, but the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith had a go. Rory Stewart said he thought he had enough support (16 other MPs, plus himself), to ensure he does not get eliminated. Citing the ConservativeHome survey today (see 9.46am), he said his campaign had real momentum. He said this would put him in a strong position for the televised hustings on Channel 4 on Sunday night. He also said he thought that the only people who could beat Boris Johnson were either him, or Johnson himself. Theresa May has just arrived. She marched swiftly past a huddle of journalists talking to Rory Stewart (or a source close to Rory Stewart - I don\u2019t think sourcing has been clarified) talking to journalists. Michael Gove is out. Who did he vote for? \u201cThe best candidate,\u201d he said. Back in the committee corridor Michael Gove has just arrived, accompanied by John Hayes, one of his supporters. Was he feeling confident? Yes, he claimed. Turning away from the Tory leadership contest for a moment, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has published an article this morning saying real income growth stalled last year, largely because of the impact of the Brexit vote on inflation. Here\u2019s an extract. Between 2011\u201312 and 2016\u201317, median incomes grew at a rate of 1.6% a year \u2013 faster than the 1.2% growth rate seen immediately before the recession (2002\u201303 to 2007\u201308). However, median household income growth stalled in 2017\u201318, making it only the fourth year (and second non-recession year) in the last 30 where median income did not grow. This stalling is in large part because real earnings fell, due to a rise in inflation following the depreciation of the pound after the UK voted to leave the European Union. Rising inflation meant that the freeze in working-age benefits hit poorer households harder than if inflation had not risen. All this means that median income in 2017\u201318 was only 5.6% higher than it was 10 years earlier, before the great recession. Jeremy Hunt has just marched in, looking quite purposefully (and not wearing morning dress - see 9.30am), with Dominic Raab, another leadership candidate immediately behind him. Sajid Javid has voted. Here is a Sky News tally of declared supporters for each candidate. Their numbers are very slightly different from ConservativeHome\u2019s. MPs have to go in one door, and they exit another. Journalists aren\u2019t allowed to film in this corridor and there is a policeman at the exit of committee room 14 (aka the Gladstone room). Most of the MPs voting are heading off quickly without hanging around to chat. Zac Goldsmith and Jo Johnson have arrived together. Some of the MPs were sent out to form a queue. We saw Leadsom re-emerge, but she is back in now, with Amber Rudd going in behind here. David Davis followed her in. The door has just been opened. Steve Brine led a largish group of Tory MPs through the door. Esther McVey and Andrea Leadsom are the only candidates here and they\u2019ve gone in. Steve Baker, the Tory Brexiter who at one stage was contemplating his own bid, is here too. I\u2019ve left my office in the Commons press galley and I\u2019m now on a bench in the committee corridor, outside committee room 14, where MPs will he voting. There are about a dozen Conservative MPs on the benches outside one of the doors to committee room 14 waiting to be allowed in to vote. Steve Brine seems to be first in the queue, followed by Sir Desmond Swayne. Other MPs here include Charlie Elphicke, Peter Bone, David Tredinnick. The ConservativeHome website regularly conducts surveys of Conservative party members as to who they want to see as their next leader. In the past they have turned out to be reasonably good indicators as to what ends up happening in internal Conservative party elections. It has published one today and it shows Boris Johnson apparently pulling ahead. More than half of members surveyed said they wanted him as leader. But the real surprise is Rory Stewart who has come from almost nowhere and is now in second place. Here is the chart. And here is an excerpt from the write-up by Paul Goodman, the ConservativeHome editor. Boris Johnson\u2019s most recent scores in our Next Tory Leader surveys have been 33 per cent, 43 per cent \u2013 and now 54 per cent. That 43 per cent score was already a record for the survey in this question, as far as we can tell, and Johnson\u2019s eve-of-poll rating sees him taking more than half the vote. Rory Stewart\u2019s brilliant campaign has taken him to second, but he is more than 40 points behind the front-runner. Dominic Raab, who was on 15 per cent at the end of May, has seen his rating almost halve since then. Johnson has clearly eaten into his support. Michael Gove\u2019s turbulent week sees four points knocked off his total \u2013 not all that much, but he had a small rating to begin with: 12 per cent. That none the less saw him second in our last survey: he is now fourth. Jeremy Hunt rises slightly from five per cent to eight per cent, and Sajid Javid does likewise from three per cent to five per cent. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, has said he was baffled and hurt by his exclusion from the state banquet for Donald Trump during last week\u2019s state visit by the US president. As the Press Association reports, Javid told the Today programme he had still not received a proper explanation as to why was the only senior cabinet minister not to be invited to the dinner at Buckingham Palace. Asked why he was not there, he told the programme: I don\u2019t know. I have asked. I was just told that normally home secretaries aren\u2019t invited. So I don\u2019t know ... I don\u2019t like it. It is odd. My office did ask No 10 and they said \u2018no\u2019. You\u2019d have to ask someone from No 10 why they made that decision. Previously Javid criticised Trump after he tweeted his support for the right-wing Britain First group. Javid said the president was endorsing the views of \u201ca vile, hate-filled racist organisation that hates me and people like me\u201d. Asked on the Today programme if he thought his exclusion was due to his Muslim background, Javid said: \u201cI am not saying that at all. I really don\u2019t know.\u201d As the BBC\u2019s Ross Hawkins points out, there is precedent for the home secretary being invited to a state banquet. This is rather bizarre from Jeremy Hunt. Presumably on the morning of his wedding Hunt was confident that he would be celebrating in the evening .... And he was looking forward to spending the day with people he liked and trusted ... And he did not have to worry about the prospect of his day being spoiled by Boris Johnson ... UPDATE: The Independent\u2019s Tom Peck has a much better take on this. Sir Oliver Letwin, the Conservative former cabinet minister who was backing the cross-party attempt yesterday block a no-deal Brexit, has said that parliament had now run out of options for preventing the UK crashing out of the EU, my colleague Matthew Weaver reports. There is nothing that excites Westminster more than a leadership election and today we have the first round of voting in the contest to replace Theresa May as Conservative leader and prime minister. The entire election will be a relatively long-drawn out process - we have got several more rounds of voting in Westminster, hustings, TV debates, and the membership ballot to look forward to - but today is going to clarify matters a bit. This is what we will find out. 1) Who\u2019s out? There are currently 10 candidates in the race. At least one of them will definitely drop out today - the person with the fewest votes - but under new rules introduced by the Conservative 1922 Committee any candidate with fewer than 17 votes (5% of the parliamentary party) will also be out. Mark Harper, Rory Stewart, Esther McVey and Andrea Leadsom all look as though they will struggle to hit this target, and so by the end of the day the field could be down to six. 2) Is Boris Johnson as far ahead as everyone thinks? The ConservativeHome website has been keeping a tally of how many MP supporters each MP has and it has Johnson well ahead, on 83, followed by Jeremy Hunt (37), Michael Gove (34), Dominic Raab (23), Sajid Javid (19) and Matthew Hancock (17). But - astonishing as the idea might seem - it is the case that occasionally MPs do not tell the truth about how they will vote in a secret ballot. Yesterday the politics academic Philip Cowley summed it up like this on Twitter. Today we will find out if there are sizeable numbers of Tories doing a Cowley. 3) Who are Johnson\u2019s main rivals? Hunt looks like the candidate most likely to join Johnson on the final ballot but, according to the ConservativeHome numbers, 75 Tory MPs have not declared for anyone and Hunt is only 20 declared votes ahead of Matthew Hancock. The results being announced at 1pm may well rank candidates in a different order to what people currently expect. Michael Gove and Dominic Raab have been struggling this week, and Sajid Javid seems to have had some last-minute momentum. By the end of today we should have a much better idea as to who might bag the number two slot. 4) Where will second preference votes start to go? At least one candidate, and perhaps up to four, will be forced out at lunchtime. It is possible that other candidates might pass the 17-vote threshold but decide to drop out anyway. Who will these people support? And where who will their supporters back? (Not always the same thing.) We may start to find out this afternoon. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: Voting starts in the first round ballot for the Conservative leadership contest. Conservative MPs vote in a Commons committee room. The poll closes at 12pm. Around 1pm: The Conservative 1922 Committee announces the results of the first ballot. 5pm: Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, gives a speech to the Institute for Government. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing mostly on the Tory leadership contest and the Commons debate. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up at the end of the day. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "Keith Haring was everywhere in the 1980s. All over the walls of the New York subway, all over T-shirts, all over posters, all over dresses and all over Grace Jones\u2019s body. You could wear him on your lapel. He was there when you needed him and there when you didn\u2019t. He was in all the galleries and nightclubs and he invaded your house. He was all over MTV and he wanted to be all over the Berlin Wall, a section of which he painted. Haring was joyous, riotous, funny and angry, this gawky skinny kid with the glasses and a Sharpie pen. And then he was gone, dead at 31 from Aids-related illness in 1990. Now he fills the top floor of Tate Liverpool and the gallery shop. His little bouncy figures climb the columns in the cafe. With his outlined boing-boing beings and miraculous babies, his barking dogs and his three-eyed faces, his boys in heat and his general malarkeys, he took potshots at God, sexual repression, America\u2019s culture of guns and the dollar, and much besides. There was more to Haring than his ubiquitous cartoons, and this travelling exhibition (it goes to Brussels and Essen), mounted with the co-operation of the artist\u2019s estate, unpacks his work from its early beginnings to his outspoken responses to the Aids crisis. There are videos of early student performance works and projected images of the 80s New York club scene.

      "body": "<p>The scars of traumatic bereavement never go away. This is especially the case when people have been killed as a result of negligence or poor decision-making by others. But the wounds of survivors, and other people directly affected by calamities such as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/11/how-grenfell-survivors-came-together-to-change-britain\" title=\"\">Grenfell Tower fire in London two years ago</a>, should become less raw and painful over time \u2013 provided they believe justice has been served and lessons learned. In the aftermath of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/26/hillsborough-families-27-year-struggle-for-truth-vindicated\" title=\"\">Hillsborough stadium disaster</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jul/27/ladbrokegrove.transport\" title=\"\">Paddington rail crash</a> and other tragedies, survivors grouped together to comfort one another. They also campaigned for justice and for changes in public policy that would ensure the same mistakes were not repeated. Many of the people who survived, or were bereaved by, the fire that consumed Grenfell Tower in the early hours of 14 June 2017 have chosen the same path.</p> <p>The survivors demanded a public inquiry, and argued that the judge appointed to run it, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, should not sit alone but with a panel, to ensure greater diversity of experience and view. They were partly successful when a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/11/theresa-may-expands-grenfell-inquiry-panel-after-survivors-pressure\" title=\"\">panel was appointed</a> for the inquiry\u2019s second stage. They called for cladding similar to that which caught fire at Grenfell to be stripped from more than 400 other high-rise buildings, and for sprinklers to be fitted and defective fire doors repaired. Working with tenant and leaseholder groups, they have again had partial success. Work on most council and housing association blocks is under way, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/may/09/government-allocates-funds-to-replace-grenfell-style-cladding\" title=\"\">government pledged last month</a> to pay for private buildings to be altered.

      "bodyText": "The scars of traumatic bereavement never go away. This is especially the case when people have been killed as a result of negligence or poor decision-making by others. But the wounds of survivors, and other people directly affected by calamities such as the Grenfell Tower fire in London two years ago, should become less raw and painful over time \u2013 provided they believe justice has been served and lessons learned. In the aftermath of the Hillsborough stadium disaster, Paddington rail crash and other tragedies, survivors grouped together to comfort one another. They also campaigned for justice and for changes in public policy that would ensure the same mistakes were not repeated. Many of the people who survived, or were bereaved by, the fire that consumed Grenfell Tower in the early hours of 14 June 2017 have chosen the same path. The survivors demanded a public inquiry, and argued that the judge appointed to run it, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, should not sit alone but with a panel, to ensure greater diversity of experience and view. They were partly successful when a panel was appointed for the inquiry\u2019s second stage. They called for cladding similar to that which caught fire at Grenfell to be stripped from more than 400 other high-rise buildings, and for sprinklers to be fitted and defective fire doors repaired. Working with tenant and leaseholder groups, they have again had partial success. Work on most council and housing association blocks is under way, and the government pledged last month to pay for private buildings to be altered. This followed months of refusals by owners to fund the work, and on Wednesday the campaign group Grenfell United arranged for flats in Newcastle, Manchester and London to be lit up with projected slogans as a way of highlighting ongoing and unacceptable risks. Of wider significance, in the sense that they could affect many more people, are proposals for a new social housing regulator and national tenants\u2019 union. These were key recommendations of the social housing commission convened last year by the charity Shelter, with former Grenfell resident Edward Daffarn among its commissioners. Whatever the public inquiry concludes, it is plain that the trust between the landlord and tenants had broken down long before the fire and residents\u2019 legitimate concerns had not been taken seriously. Yet since last year\u2019s promise of a \u201cnew deal\u201d for social housing tenants, the government has done almost nothing. That the Grenfell campaigners continue to lobby for new laws, as well as practical safety measures, is to their credit. It is heartening to see how, even in the midst of grief and trauma, people can work so hard for the good of others.

Armed officers faced off in the Tennessee city with crowds angered by news that federal marshals had shot dead a local man, whom authorities described as a fugitive, officials said. Memphis\u2019s mayor, Jim Strickland, said six officers were taken to the hospital.

      "bodyText": "The home secretary, Sajid Javid, has revealed he has signed a request for Julian Assange to be extradited to the US where he faces charges of computer hacking. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Thursday, Javid said: \u201cHe\u2019s rightly behind bars. There\u2019s an extradition request from the US that is before the courts tomorrow but yesterday I signed the extradition order and certified it and that will be going in front of the courts tomorrow.\u201d Javid\u2019s decision opens the way to the court sending the WikiLeaks founder to the US. Assange faces an 18-count indictment, issued by the US Department of Justice, that includes charges under the Espionage Act. He is accused of soliciting and publishing classified information and conspiring to hack into a government computer. Javid said: \u201cIt is a decision ultimately for the courts, but there is a very important part of it for the home secretary and I want to see justice done at all times and we\u2019ve got a legitimate extradition request, so I\u2019ve signed it, but the final decision is now with the courts.\u201d The 47-year-old Australian was too ill to appear last month at a hearing at Westminster magistrates court in relation to the US request. The hearing has been rescheduled for Friday, and depending on Assange\u2019s condition, may take place at Belmarsh prison where he is being held. Javid\u2019s decision follows news last week that an attempt to extradite Assange to Sweden had had a setback after a court in Uppsala said he did not need to be detained. The ruling by the district court prevented Swedish prosecutors from applying immediately for an extradition warrant for Assange to face an allegation of rape dating back to 2010. Assange denies the accusation. Assange is serving a 50-week sentence in Britain for skipping bail after he spent seven years in the Ecuadorian embassy in London attempting to avoid extradition to Sweden. Swedish prosecutors dropped their rape investigation in 2017 but reopened it after Ecuador rescinded its offer of asylum to Assange in April this year and allowed British police to arrest him. Thomas Garner, an extradition lawyer at Gherson Solicitors, said Javid\u2019s certification of the request was \u201can important though merely procedural step\u201d to start the extradition process. \u201cI would expect the court to set a preliminary timetable for the extradition process tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is likely to be many months before any hearing at the magistrates court and of course either side may then seek to appeal that decision in due course. Despite this, the Swedish authorities will be monitoring the process carefully as the further down the line the US proceedings get the harder it might become for the home secretary to give precedence to any competing request.\u201d",

He has kept a low profile in the media and stayed in the tearooms and in his office, methodically talking round colleagues. His team know that one negative news cycle because of an off-guard comment could see his star plummet \u2013 and Johnson is more prone to those than most.</p> <p>His biggest risk is the upcoming TV debates, which his team has not confirmed he will take part in. If he dodges them, he will be accused of avoiding scrutiny, which went badly for Theresa May in the general election. If he takes part, all the other candidates are likely to turn their attacks on him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2019/jun/13/conservative-leadership-election-full-results\">Full results of the Conservative leadership election - round 1</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Jeremy Hunt</h2> <p>His team insisted he was pleased with second place, but he must have been hoping for a better showing than 43 votes, just over a third of Johnson\u2019s tally. The foreign secretary has the most impressive endorsements, both cabinet Europhile Amber Rudd and its two biggest Brexit beasts, Penny Mordaunt and Liam Fox.</p> <p>Hunt\u2019s problem is he is seen as the continuity candidate, the safe pair of hands, when colleagues are starting to see the attraction of a new style.</p> <p>He will need to try and shake the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/10/jeremy-hunt-wins-support-penny-mordaunt-conservative-leadership\">Theresa in Trousers</a>\u201d moniker and try to explain better to Tory MPs why he, and not Johnson, has a better chance of beating Jeremy Corbyn.</p> <h2>Michael Gove</h2> <p>Gove has had perhaps the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/11/michael-goves-highs-and-lows-come-under-scrutiny\">worst leadership contest so far</a> \u2013 his admission that he had taken cocaine dominated the news cycle for almost five days and his backers feared that Gove, once expected to be a shoo-in for the final two, would haemorrhage votes.</p> <p>Coming in third behind Hunt is perhaps a better show than Gove <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/10/tory-hopefuls-prove-you-dont-need-to-be-on-drugs-to-be-off-your-head\">might have expected</a> in the circumstances.

      "bodyText": "After the first round of voting, Boris Johnson is the clear frontrunner, but the rest of the picture looks less clear. Here\u2019s what the candidates need to do \u2013 and avoid doing \u2013 to get down to the final two and on to the members\u2019 ballot. Boris Johnson The former foreign secretary already has enough support to progress through to the members\u2019 ballot. All Johnson needs to do is sit tight, keep his MPs sweet and try not to ruin it for himself. The biggest risk for Johnson is himself. He has kept a low profile in the media and stayed in the tearooms and in his office, methodically talking round colleagues. His team know that one negative news cycle because of an off-guard comment could see his star plummet \u2013 and Johnson is more prone to those than most. His biggest risk is the upcoming TV debates, which his team has not confirmed he will take part in. If he dodges them, he will be accused of avoiding scrutiny, which went badly for Theresa May in the general election. If he takes part, all the other candidates are likely to turn their attacks on him. Jeremy Hunt His team insisted he was pleased with second place, but he must have been hoping for a better showing than 43 votes, just over a third of Johnson\u2019s tally. The foreign secretary has the most impressive endorsements, both cabinet Europhile Amber Rudd and its two biggest Brexit beasts, Penny Mordaunt and Liam Fox. Hunt\u2019s problem is he is seen as the continuity candidate, the safe pair of hands, when colleagues are starting to see the attraction of a new style. He will need to try and shake the \u201cTheresa in Trousers\u201d moniker and try to explain better to Tory MPs why he, and not Johnson, has a better chance of beating Jeremy Corbyn. Michael Gove Gove has had perhaps the worst leadership contest so far \u2013 his admission that he had taken cocaine dominated the news cycle for almost five days and his backers feared that Gove, once expected to be a shoo-in for the final two, would haemorrhage votes. Coming in third behind Hunt is perhaps a better show than Gove might have expected in the circumstances. There could still be a recovery for the environment secretary. He has better Brexiter credentials than Hunt, is liked by the moderate wing of the party, and is a better orator than almost any other candidate. That will mean he could regain some backers if he gives a good performance in the TV debates \u2013 though colleagues may think that his momentum has permanently stalled. Dominic Raab Raab modelled himself as the true Brexiter candidate for the new generation, but lost out on a slew of endorsements from the European Research Group of hard Brexiter Tories, who have rallied behind Johnson. He also had some rocky moments during his launch week, with awkward questions about his comments on feminists. It is difficult to see how his campaign could recover, though he could pick up a number of new endorsements from candidates who have been eliminated, including Esther McVey and Andrea Leadsom \u2013 but there are not many between them. His limited chance of success really now depends on whether Johnson stumbles and a more moderate candidate gains momentum, in which case Raab could be the beneficiary. His friends say he is unlikely to drop out until he has to \u2013 one called him \u201cthe Japanese soldier on the island still fighting world war two\u201d. Sajid Javid Javid struggled to define himself in the first days of the campaign, not a fresh face, not a safe pair of hands, or a true Brexit believer \u2013 none of which was helped by a shonky launch video. Yet his campaign has improved markedly in recent days, with the endorsement of popular Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson, a polished leadership video telling the moving story of his background, and a lively launch speech, even though it was delayed by two hours by a parliamentary vote. The boost Javid has had in recent days is probably what has kept him in the race, though his spinners have been forced into describing him as coming \u201ca strong fifth\u201d. He is expected to make a new push over the weekend to define himself as the change candidate who can talk to Tory voters in new places \u2013 though he may also be tempted to drop out to tuck in behind one of the frontrunners. However, it is hard to see how he could make it into the final two from this position. Matt Hancock The health secretary has run an energetic campaign arguing that the Tories must also pay attention to the threat from the Lib Dems as well as the Brexit party. His leadership launch was a touch shambolic, however \u2013 he stood in front of a window which made him look like a walking silhouette on the TV. Though his team have suggested he got more votes than he expected, he cannot have been pleased to have come just one vote above Rory Stewart, the outsider who many expected would be eliminated in this round. Hancock would have hoped he could pick up Stewart\u2019s supporters, but may now feel his bid has come to the end of the road. Rory Stewart Stewart said he was \u201cover the moon\u201d to scrape into the next round of voting with 19 votes, one-sixth of Johnson\u2019s tally, and insisted afterwards he could still make the final two. Stewart still has a mountain to climb to get into the next round, where he will need to get another 14 endorsements \u2013 and avoid coming last \u2013 or he will be automatically eliminated. The safe money would say it is likely that he will not make it through the next round, yet it is just about possible that his mounting popularity with the public could convince colleagues to take a gamble on him if they hope to find an outsider with a chance of beating Johnson.",

As the group\u2019s treasurer for many years, Jean ensured that its limited funds were well spent on the training, mentoring and advice so vital to getting women selected as candidates and then elected to parliament.</p> <p>Together we wrote various training guides about how to be selected as a parliamentary candidate (including Uphill All the Way and A Woman\u2019s Place Is in the House) and took training classes at weekend events held for potential female candidates, as well as those already selected.</p> <p>Jean was born in Elgin, in the north-east of Scotland, the third of four girls to Norman Black, a stonemason, and his wife, Margaret (nee McLennan). She left home to work in market research in Aberdeen and then Abu Dhabi, before settling in London. Eventually she went to North East London Polytechnic (now the University of East London) as a mature student, studying sociology, market research and statistics.</p> <p>Jean\u2019s intellect and innate interest in people enabled her to forge a successful career, working worldwide for a number of market research firms, including IRB International, Gfk NOP, Cello MRUK and Ipsos Mori, before going freelance from 2012 to 2015.</p> <p>She was independent, strong, courageous, outspoken, fearless and honest, with humour, energy and common sense. She was always a good person to have on your side.</p> <p>These attributes helped her to cope with difficult times in her life. At 34 she was diagnosed with leukaemia and she only survived because her youngest sister, Norma, donated her bone marrow. Throughout her treatment, Steve Rickett, the husband she christened her \u201crock\u201d, was always by her side. She and Steve had met through the Labour party in 1993 and they married the following year.</p> <p>On each anniversary of her transplant Jean held a party to celebrate another year\u2019s survival, with the invitation boldly proclaiming: \u201cI\u2019m still standing.\u201d Years later, when diagnosed with breast cancer, she endured yet more treatment, continuing to work throughout the chemotherapy.</p> <p>In their early 40s Jean and Steve adopted Nicholas, then aged six. Mother and son immediately formed the closest of bonds and he became her inspiration and her joy.</p> <p>In 2015 the family moved to Somerset, where she started a new and fulfilling career in health and social care, contributing to the local community as a carer and a volunteer for the local food bank.</p> <p>She is survived by Steve, Nicholas, her mother and her sisters.</p>",

      "bodyText": "My friend Jean Black, who has died aged 57 of cancer, was one of the founders of the Labour Women\u2019s Network, which has partly been responsible for the dramatic increase in the number of female Labour MPs over the past 30 years. It was thanks to the network\u2019s influence that when Labour was elected to government in 1997 more than 100 of its MPs were women. As the group\u2019s treasurer for many years, Jean ensured that its limited funds were well spent on the training, mentoring and advice so vital to getting women selected as candidates and then elected to parliament. Together we wrote various training guides about how to be selected as a parliamentary candidate (including Uphill All the Way and A Woman\u2019s Place Is in the House) and took training classes at weekend events held for potential female candidates, as well as those already selected. Jean was born in Elgin, in the north-east of Scotland, the third of four girls to Norman Black, a stonemason, and his wife, Margaret (nee McLennan). She left home to work in market research in Aberdeen and then Abu Dhabi, before settling in London. Eventually she went to North East London Polytechnic (now the University of East London) as a mature student, studying sociology, market research and statistics. Jean\u2019s intellect and innate interest in people enabled her to forge a successful career, working worldwide for a number of market research firms, including IRB International, Gfk NOP, Cello MRUK and Ipsos Mori, before going freelance from 2012 to 2015. She was independent, strong, courageous, outspoken, fearless and honest, with humour, energy and common sense. She was always a good person to have on your side. These attributes helped her to cope with difficult times in her life. At 34 she was diagnosed with leukaemia and she only survived because her youngest sister, Norma, donated her bone marrow. Throughout her treatment, Steve Rickett, the husband she christened her \u201crock\u201d, was always by her side. She and Steve had met through the Labour party in 1993 and they married the following year. On each anniversary of her transplant Jean held a party to celebrate another year\u2019s survival, with the invitation boldly proclaiming: \u201cI\u2019m still standing.\u201d Years later, when diagnosed with breast cancer, she endured yet more treatment, continuing to work throughout the chemotherapy. In their early 40s Jean and Steve adopted Nicholas, then aged six. Mother and son immediately formed the closest of bonds and he became her inspiration and her joy. In 2015 the family moved to Somerset, where she started a new and fulfilling career in health and social care, contributing to the local community as a carer and a volunteer for the local food bank. She is survived by Steve, Nicholas, her mother and her sisters.",

      "body": "<p>Peter Whitehead, who has died aged 82, could justifiably claim to be one of Britain\u2019s most distinctive and provocative film-makers. His film about the Rolling Stones, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/nov/05/rolling-stones-documentary\" title=\"\">Charlie Is My Darling</a> (1966), was a pioneering portrait of the group amid the whirlwind of fan mania, its on-the-road intimacy a precursor of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/17/dont-look-back-bob-dylan-invention-rockumentary\" title=\"\">Donn Pennebaker\u2019s Bob Dylan film Don\u2019t Look Back</a> and a blueprint for countless future music documentaries.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/184927842\">Tonite Let\u2019s All Make Love in London</a> (1967), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/nov/22/artsfeatures7\" title=\"\">Whitehead</a> created what for many critics was the definitive document of swinging London, a white-hot crucible of music, fashion and film. The many short music films Whitehead made in the 1960s foreshadowed the era of the video promo clip that blossomed in the MTV era of the 80s.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EAaug9ghf8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3EAaug9ghf8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Peter Whitehead\u2019s London 66-67, with Pink Floyd, consisted of longer versions of material that had been intended for Tonite Let\u2019s All Make Love in London</figcaption> </figure>   <p>But by the time he made The Fall (1969), arguably his masterpiece, the intellectually restless Whitehead had moved beyond being merely an onlooker recording events with his camera and was pursuing his own inner journey through a period of violent social and political change.</p> <p>His most intensely creative period began in 1965, when he filmed the <a href=\"https://www.royalalberthall.com/about-the-hall/news/2016/january/11-june-1965-allen-ginsberg-and-the-beat-poets-create-a-cultural-storm-at-the-hall/\" title=\"\">International Poetry Incarnation</a> \u2013 a gathering of beat poets, including <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-allen-ginsberg-1265816.html\" title=\"\">All</a><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-allen-ginsberg-1265816.html\" title=\"\">en Ginsberg</a> and <a href=\"mailto:\" title=\"\">Lawrence Ferlinghetti</a> \u2013 at the Royal Albert Hall in London, to make the 33-minute documentary Wholly Communion.</p> <p>Word of this reached the Rolling Stones manager <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/may/25/artsfeatures.therollingstones\" title=\"\">Andrew Loog Oldham</a>, who invited Whitehead to film the Stones\u2019 trip to Belfast and Dublin in September that year. The resulting Charlie Is My Darling had its first public screening at the 1966 Mannheim film festival, where it was considered for the gold medal (which was won instead by Wholly Communion). However, a clash with Oldham about the film\u2019s portrayal of the Stones meant that it never went on general release.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWdYrd_UH9E\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jWdYrd_UH9E?start=21&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=21\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>An extract from Peter Whitehead\u2019s Wholly Communion, 1965</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Whitehead did further work with the Stones, including the promo film for the single Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow? (1966) and the audacious clip for We Love You (1967). The latter was shot the day before Mick Jagger and Keith Richards appealed against their drug convictions, and starred the two Stones and Marianne Faithfull in a remake of Oscar Wilde\u2019s indecency trial. \u201cMy ambitions are very high \u2013 none higher \u2013 to be a genius in and with the cinema,\u201d Whitehead wrote in a letter to Oldham.</p> <p>Though he was a classical music enthusiast with little interest in pop, Whitehead understood its potency. He shot films with the Small Faces, Eric Burdon, Jimi Hendrix, Nico, the Beach Boys and Pink Floyd, and in 1970 he made a memorable concert film of Led Zeppelin at the Albert Hall.</p> <p>While Tonite Let\u2019s All Make Love in London made Whitehead the toast of the 60s in-crowd, the film also included critical remarks about the vapidity of the London milieu from Jagger, Michael Caine and David Hockney. Whitehead himself, a vehement opponent of US imperialism and the Vietnam war, had a theory that the invention of \u201cswinging London\u201d was \u201ca CIA manoeuvre designed to make British counterculture appear inconsequential and impotent\u201d, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/nov/22/artsfeatures7\" title=\"\">he wrote</a> in 2002.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE2l6OIGaLE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PE2l6OIGaLE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Peter Whitehead on making a promo film with the Dubliners</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Thus he was enthusiastic about Peter Brook\u2019s invitation to film his experimental Royal Shakespeare Company play US, designed to challenge British apathy about the escalating Vietnam conflict. When the resulting film, Benefit of the Doubt, was screened alongside Tonite \u2026 at the New York film festival in September 1967, Whitehead was invited to make a film about the New York \u201cscene\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/16/peter-whitehead-obituary-letter\">Letter: An archive for Peter Whitehead</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He was eager to oblige, but the project, eventually released as The Fall (1969), ballooned into a panorama of politics, violent protest and an anguished examination of the role of the documentary film-maker, as Whitehead became a participant in the 1968 student occupation of New York\u2019s Columbia University. His filming schedule was bookended by the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy. He wrote that when he got back to London, \u201cI had a nervous breakdown. Didn\u2019t speak for three months.\u201d</p> <p>Born in Liverpool, Peter was the only child of William, a plumber who worked at the city\u2019s docks, and his wife, Zenia. In 1940 his father was sent to Iran for wartime service, after which his mother had to give up the family home. Whitehead later wrote: \u201cI spent the war years drifting, wandering from town to town, living alone with my mother in numerous cheap single bed sitting rooms in rented accommodations around Lancashire.\u201d In 1941 they moved to Leyland, where his mother worked in a factory making Spitfires. Peter attended Leyland Methodist school.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/nov/22/artsfeatures7\">Those crazy, joyous days</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When his father returned from the second world war the family moved to London and lived in council accommodation while his father tried to start a plumbing business. Peter took his 11-plus exam at St Leonard\u2019s Church of England primary school in Streatham and in 1949 won a local authority scholarship to Ashville college in Harrogate, Yorkshire. Around this time his father died of cancer.</p> <p>Though he thrived at Ashville, captaining the rugby team, becoming the school organist and winning a scholarship to Peterhouse, Cambridge, to study maths, physics and chemistry, his experiences crystallised the seething class consciousness that never left him. </p> <p>Before Cambridge, Whitehead did two years\u2019 national service in the army. Once he was at university, he wanted to switch to English literature, but succeeded only in moving to physiology, mineralogy and crystallography.

      "bodyText": "Peter Whitehead, who has died aged 82, could justifiably claim to be one of Britain\u2019s most distinctive and provocative film-makers. His film about the Rolling Stones, Charlie Is My Darling (1966), was a pioneering portrait of the group amid the whirlwind of fan mania, its on-the-road intimacy a precursor of Donn Pennebaker\u2019s Bob Dylan film Don\u2019t Look Back and a blueprint for countless future music documentaries. In Tonite Let\u2019s All Make Love in London (1967), Whitehead created what for many critics was the definitive document of swinging London, a white-hot crucible of music, fashion and film. The many short music films Whitehead made in the 1960s foreshadowed the era of the video promo clip that blossomed in the MTV era of the 80s. But by the time he made The Fall (1969), arguably his masterpiece, the intellectually restless Whitehead had moved beyond being merely an onlooker recording events with his camera and was pursuing his own inner journey through a period of violent social and political change. His most intensely creative period began in 1965, when he filmed the International Poetry Incarnation \u2013 a gathering of beat poets, including Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti \u2013 at the Royal Albert Hall in London, to make the 33-minute documentary Wholly Communion. Word of this reached the Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham, who invited Whitehead to film the Stones\u2019 trip to Belfast and Dublin in September that year. The resulting Charlie Is My Darling had its first public screening at the 1966 Mannheim film festival, where it was considered for the gold medal (which was won instead by Wholly Communion). However, a clash with Oldham about the film\u2019s portrayal of the Stones meant that it never went on general release. Whitehead did further work with the Stones, including the promo film for the single Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow? (1966) and the audacious clip for We Love You (1967). The latter was shot the day before Mick Jagger and Keith Richards appealed against their drug convictions, and starred the two Stones and Marianne Faithfull in a remake of Oscar Wilde\u2019s indecency trial. \u201cMy ambitions are very high \u2013 none higher \u2013 to be a genius in and with the cinema,\u201d Whitehead wrote in a letter to Oldham. Though he was a classical music enthusiast with little interest in pop, Whitehead understood its potency. He shot films with the Small Faces, Eric Burdon, Jimi Hendrix, Nico, the Beach Boys and Pink Floyd, and in 1970 he made a memorable concert film of Led Zeppelin at the Albert Hall. While Tonite Let\u2019s All Make Love in London made Whitehead the toast of the 60s in-crowd, the film also included critical remarks about the vapidity of the London milieu from Jagger, Michael Caine and David Hockney. Whitehead himself, a vehement opponent of US imperialism and the Vietnam war, had a theory that the invention of \u201cswinging London\u201d was \u201ca CIA manoeuvre designed to make British counterculture appear inconsequential and impotent\u201d, as he wrote in 2002. Thus he was enthusiastic about Peter Brook\u2019s invitation to film his experimental Royal Shakespeare Company play US, designed to challenge British apathy about the escalating Vietnam conflict. When the resulting film, Benefit of the Doubt, was screened alongside Tonite \u2026 at the New York film festival in September 1967, Whitehead was invited to make a film about the New York \u201cscene\u201d. He was eager to oblige, but the project, eventually released as The Fall (1969), ballooned into a panorama of politics, violent protest and an anguished examination of the role of the documentary film-maker, as Whitehead became a participant in the 1968 student occupation of New York\u2019s Columbia University. His filming schedule was bookended by the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy. He wrote that when he got back to London, \u201cI had a nervous breakdown. Didn\u2019t speak for three months.\u201d Born in Liverpool, Peter was the only child of William, a plumber who worked at the city\u2019s docks, and his wife, Zenia. In 1940 his father was sent to Iran for wartime service, after which his mother had to give up the family home. Whitehead later wrote: \u201cI spent the war years drifting, wandering from town to town, living alone with my mother in numerous cheap single bed sitting rooms in rented accommodations around Lancashire.\u201d In 1941 they moved to Leyland, where his mother worked in a factory making Spitfires. Peter attended Leyland Methodist school. When his father returned from the second world war the family moved to London and lived in council accommodation while his father tried to start a plumbing business. Peter took his 11-plus exam at St Leonard\u2019s Church of England primary school in Streatham and in 1949 won a local authority scholarship to Ashville college in Harrogate, Yorkshire. Around this time his father died of cancer. Though he thrived at Ashville, captaining the rugby team, becoming the school organist and winning a scholarship to Peterhouse, Cambridge, to study maths, physics and chemistry, his experiences crystallised the seething class consciousness that never left him. Before Cambridge, Whitehead did two years\u2019 national service in the army. Once he was at university, he wanted to switch to English literature, but succeeded only in moving to physiology, mineralogy and crystallography. He was able to assuage his writerly urges with contributions to the Cambridge Evening News and the university newspaper, and won a scholarship to the Slade School of Art in London. This was to train as a painter, but Whitehead, who at Cambridge had been an avid consumer of the films of Ingmar Bergman, Jean-Luc Godard and Federico Fellini, was suddenly gripped by a passion for film-making. He became one of the first students at the Slade\u2019s new film department, run by the film director Thorold Dickinson. A pair of short films Whitehead made in 1962 gained him a contract with the Nuffield Foundation, for which he made The Perception of Life (1964), about how advances in microscopy had expanded scientific knowledge. Also in 1964, Whitehead worked as a freelance documentary cameraman for Italian television. The traumas of making The Fall prompted Whitehead to move away from film-making. Though he made Daddy (1973), a sexual psychodrama about the sculptor Niki de Saint Phalle, and Fire in the Water (1977), a vehicle for his then partner Nathalie Delon, his attention now centred on breeding falcons. He was obsessed with the ancient Egyptian story of Isis and Osiris giving birth to Horus the falcon. In 1981 he was invited by Prince Khalid al-Faisal of Saudi Arabia to assist in building the Al Faisal Centre, the world\u2019s largest falcon-breeding establishment, on top of the country\u2019s highest mountain, Al Souda. Whitehead moved there with his wife, Dido Goldsmith, daughter of the environmentalist Teddy Goldsmith, whom he had married in 1980. However, the project was cut short in 1991 by the first Gulf war. Returning to London, Whitehead poured his energies into writing novels, frequently self-published in the absence of commercial interest. One of them was Terrorism Considered As One of the Fine Arts (2007), which Whitehead turned into a film in 2009, shot in Vienna. Its themes included \u201cthe CIA\u2019s influence on English culture\u201d and \u201cthe fear that the state spreads in order to control\u201d. In 1998 Whitehead appeared in The Falconer on Channel 4, a \u201cfictionalised biography\u201d of him by Chris Petit and Iain Sinclair. After initially hailing it as a masterpiece, Whitehead changed his mind and called it \u201ca deliberate, calculated betrayal\u201d. Paul Cronin\u2019s two-part documentary In the Beginning Was the Image: Conversations With Peter Whitehead (2006), comprised new and archive interviews with Whitehead and extracts from his work. His marriage to Goldsmith ended in 2002. Their daughter Robin died of a heroin overdose in 2010, while she was making the documentary The Road to Albion about the Libertines frontman Pete Doherty. A subsequent marriage, to Liza Kareninam, ended in divorce. Whitehead is survived by seven children: three daughters, Leila, Charlene and Rosetta, from his marriage to Goldsmith; Tamsin and Sian, the daughters of his first marriage, to Diane Leigh (nee Cottrill), which ended in divorce; a daughter, Joanna, from a relationship with Deanna Woodrow; and a son, Harry, from a relationship with Coral Atkins. \u2022 Peter Lorrimer Whitehead, film-maker and writer, born 8 January 1937; died 10 June 2019",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s race to increase renewable energy sources has intensified with the announcement of plans to close another coal-fired power station. The news on Thursday came as last winter was revealed to be the greenest yet for the country\u2019s energy system, after strong winds produced more renewable electricity and coal-fired power dwindled. SSE said Fiddler\u2019s Ferry near Warrington, Cheshire, the energy company\u2019s last remaining coal-fired power station, would close in March 2020, reducing the UK\u2019s coal-fired energy fleet to five plants. National Grid, the operator of the UK\u2019s electricity network, said mild temperatures combined with strong winds ensured the carbon intensity of Britain\u2019s electricity \u2013 the amount of carbon produced for every kilowatt of electricity \u2013 fell to an average of 242.8 grams of carbon between October and March, from 280.2 grams a year earlier. National Grid said the UK relied less on coal power plants over winter, partly because it was the fifth-warmest recorded in the past 59 years. The milder temperatures dampened energy demand, making it easier to avoid using coal in favour of running gas power plants, which produce half the carbon emissions. Meanwhile, stronger wind speeds helped drive down carbon emissions by spurring higher levels of low-carbon renewable electricity from windfarms. Elsewhere in the world, severe winters and hotter than normal summers have had the opposite effect, driving up energy demand to run heating and cooling systems, increasing global emissions. National Grid said the UK\u2019s carbon intensity was almost half the level of five years ago and was likely to fall further as coal plants shut down. The report emerged weeks after the country\u2019s energy system ran coal-free for more than a fortnight for the first time since the Industrial Revolution. Fintan Slye, the head of National Grid\u2019s system operator arm, said: \u201cMore renewable power generation and less coal is a trend that is here to stay, and this carbon intensity milestone shows the pace of change in the UK energy industry. \u201cWe believe that by 2025, we will be able to fully operate Great Britain\u2019s electricity system with zero carbon.\u201d Coal-fired power made up 5% of the UK\u2019s electricity over the winter and will be phased out altogether by 2025 under a government ban. Wind power and nuclear plants each made up 18% of the power generation mix, while gas-fired power plants produced 42%. Stephen Wheeler, the managing director of thermal energy at SSE, said Fiddler\u2019s Ferry could not compete with the economics of gas and renewable energy. He said SSE made the \u201cdifficult decision\u201d because the plant is losing \u00a340m a year, as government policy focuses on supporting less carbon-intensive forms of energy. \u201cFinancially, the station is making significant losses and our projections show that this will continue to be the case as the UK looks to phase out coal-fired generation by 2025 at the latest,\u201d he said. \u201cAt nearly 50 years old, the station is unable to compete with more efficient and modern gas and renewable generation.\u201d SSE\u2019s announcement follows EDF Energy\u2019s plan to close the Cottam coal plant in September, which it announced after a winter of record-low coal generation. Once Cottam and Fiddlers Ferry shut, the UK\u2019s remaining coal plants will be Aberthaw B in South Wales, West Burton A and Ratcliffe-on-Soar in Nottinghamshire, Kilroot in Northern Ireland and two generation units at the Drax site in Yorkshire, which are earmarked for conversion to burn gas.",

Around 18.5 million barrels a day of crude and refined products moved through it in 2016, nearly a third of all seaborne-traded oil and almost 20% of all oil produced globally, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That makes the Strait of Hormuz the world\u2019s most sensitive oil transportation choke point.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/wlwatts/status/1139149573685989377\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Strait of Hormuz: What you need to know about the world&#39;s most important oil choke point <a href=\"https://t.co/fFXg2Zz4Kg\">https://t.co/fFXg2Zz4Kg</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/QsEpZFOEH5\">pic.twitter.com/QsEpZFOEH5</a></p>&mdash; Bill Watts (@wlwatts) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wlwatts/status/1139149573685989377?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 13, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d0249b38f080adae489762a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-13T13:04:49.903Z\">2.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Iran hasn\u2019t said who it thinks is responsible for today\u2019s attacks off its coastline.</strong></p> <p>But on Twitter, foreign minister Javad Zarif has described the attacks as beyond suspicious:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JZarif/status/1139108730996477952\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Reported attacks on Japan-related tankers occurred while PM <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AbeShinzo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AbeShinzo</a> was meeting with Ayatollah <a href=\"https://twitter.com/khamenei_ir?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@khamenei_ir</a> for extensive and friendly talks. <br><br>Suspicious doesn&#39;t begin to describe what likely transpired this morning. <br><br>Iran&#39;s proposed Regional Dialogue Forum is imperative.</p>&mdash; Javad Zarif (@JZarif) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JZarif/status/1139108730996477952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 13, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d0246fc8f080adae48975f7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-13T13:00:53.654Z\">2.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s the key line from president Rouhani\u2019s speech on Iranian TV:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cSecurity is of high importance to Iran in the sensitive region of the Persian Gulf, in the Middle East, in Asia and in the whole world.

      "bodyText": "Ellie Geranmayeh of the European Council on Foreign Relation points out that the Middle East doesn\u2019t look safer since the White House ripped up the Iranian nuclear deal. Here\u2019s another video clip of one of the tankers: Time for a quick catch-up. Oil prices have spiked after two vessels were seemingly attacked in the Gulf of Oman, one of the world\u2019s most important shipping lanes, today. The Front Altair and the Kokuka Courageous were both hit this morning, forcing their crews to be evacuated. Mapping data shows that both ships suddenly halted this morning.... a month after a similar attack on four boats in the area. Video footage and photos show fire and smoke erupting from one of the two ships. No-one has claimed responsibility for the attacks, but a US official has claimed that Iran was \u2018highly likely\u2019 to be behind them. Iran, though, insists that it isn\u2019t to blame - calling the attacks more than suspicious. President Hassan Rouhani said in a speech on Iranian TV: \u201cSecurity is of high importance to Iran in the sensitive region of the Persian Gulf, in the Middle East, in Asia and in the whole world. We have always tried to secure peace and stability in the region.\u201d The UN has condemned the attacks. Fears of military conflict between Washington and Tehran sent the oil price up over 4.5%, with Brent crude hitting $62.64 per barrel and US crude touching $53.45. This is dragging oil away from the five-month lows struck last night. Middle Eastern stock markets also fell, with the Saudi exchange shedding 1.5%, and Oman and Dubai both down over 1%. Here\u2019s our latest news story on the attacks: United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has strongly condemned today\u2019s attacks. Guterres warned that the world cannot afford \u201ca major confrontation in the Gulf region,\u201d adding: \u201cI strongly condemn any attack against civilian vessels. Facts must be established and responsibilities clarified.\u201d Fawaz A. Gerges, professor of Middle Eastern politics at the London School of Economics, fears that today\u2019s attacks increase the risk of a military clash between the US and Iran. Gerges told Bloomberg: \u201cEven in the absence of ironclad evidence, the U.S. and its allies will point the finger at Iran. These incidents are a bad omen because they point to a calculated escalation that tells us both sides are hunkering down.\u201d A U.S. defense official has told CBS News that it is \u201chighly likely\u201d that Iran caused today\u2019s attacks. CBS says: The official dismissed an Iranian claim to have rescued the crews of both vessels in the Gulf of Oman as \u201cpatently false.\u201d He said the USS Bainbridge picked up 21 crew members. Iran claimed it dispatched search teams that rescued 44 sailors from the two vessels. The official told Martin he had seen reports that members of one of the tanker crews believed they were hit by a torpedo or a mine, but that he couldn\u2019t confirm those reports. A U.S. official told Martin that American authorities expected to recover sufficient debris from the attacks to be able to trace them back to their source. Here\u2019s a video clip of one of the stricken vessels, filmed from another nearby boat. You can get up to speed on the oil tanker attacks with our Q&amp;A: Sky News have just shown a couple of photos of one of the two tankers which were struck today: Shipping company Frontline has now reported that \u201cno marine pollution\u201d has been seen from its Front Altair tanker following today\u2019s attack. Frontline also says the ship\u2019s crew was picked up by another cargo vessel, called Hyundai Dubai, before being transferred to an Iranian naval vessel and being taken to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas. The crew was made up of 11 Russian citizens, one Georgian, and 11 Philippine nationals, it adds. Marketwatch have written a handy guide to the Gulf region, explaining why today\u2019s attacks are so important to the world economy. Here\u2019s a flavour: Where is the Strait of Hormuz? The Strait of Hormuz is a narrow waterway that, as noted, links the Persian Gulf with the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. At its narrowest point, the waterway is only 21 miles wide, and the width of the shipping lane in either direction is just 2 miles, separated by a two-mile buffer zone. Why is it important? Oil tankers carrying crude from ports on the Persian Gulf must pass through the strait. Around 18.5 million barrels a day of crude and refined products moved through it in 2016, nearly a third of all seaborne-traded oil and almost 20% of all oil produced globally, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That makes the Strait of Hormuz the world\u2019s most sensitive oil transportation choke point. Iran hasn\u2019t said who it thinks is responsible for today\u2019s attacks off its coastline. But on Twitter, foreign minister Javad Zarif has described the attacks as beyond suspicious: Here\u2019s the key line from president Rouhani\u2019s speech on Iranian TV: \u201cSecurity is of high importance to Iran in the sensitive region of the Persian Gulf, in the Middle East, in Asia and in the whole world. We have always tried to secure peace and stability in the region.\u201d Newsflash: Iranian president Hassan Rouhani has spoken about the tanker attacks on TV. He\u2019s said security in the Gulf is a high priority for Tehran. Oil is pushing higher, as events in the Gulf of Oman continue to alarm investors. Brent crude is now up almost 4.5% at $62.64 per barrel, as it continues to bounce back from last night\u2019s five-month lows. US crude is also up over 4%, at $53.25 per barrel. Ben Macfarlane, market analyst at utility firm Inspired Energy, has warned that further attacks could drive oil higher yet: \u201cAdditional concerns could see crude oil prices continue to rise over the coming days, as markets respond to the heightened tensions in the region and the risk that access to such a vital supply route could be restricted, with up to a fifth of global oil supply passing through the Gulf of Oman near the Strait of Hormuz.\u201d Reuters is reporting that oil tanker owners DHT Holdings and Heidmar have suspended new bookings to the Mid-East Gulf, according to ship brokers. DHT has a large fleet of Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs) and Heidmar has a wide range of oil tankers. One source said they had suspended offerings for their Suezmax vessels, capable of carrying 1 million barrels and their VLCCs. The two companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The AFP newswire have also been told that Front Altair is still afloat, despite today\u2019s attack on the tanker. They say: Norwegian tanker Front Altair was still afloat after a reported attack in the Gulf of Oman on Thursday, the chief executive of the company that owns the vessel told AFP, denying reports it had sunk. \u201cI can confirm that the vessel has NOT sunk,\u201d Frontline chief executive Robert Hvide Macleod wrote in a text message to AFP. The 23 people who were on board were \u201call safe\u201d, he added. The Front Altair and another tanker were reportedly attacked in Thursday\u2019s incident, which sent world oil prices soaring. Stock markets across the Middle East are sliding today. Investors are selling stocks, on fears that relations between the US and Iran could deteriorate following today\u2019s attacks. The Saudi Tadawul has dropped by around 1%. Energy companies are among the top fallers, reflecting fears that supplies could be disrupted. Consumer stocks and industrial companies are also down -- they\u2019d suffer from economic disruption. Oman\u2019s Muscat stock exchance has also shed 1%, while Dubai\u2019s DFM index has lost 1.1% (led by a sharp fall in consumer stocks). Iran\u2019s official state TV service, IRIB, has produced this photo which allegedly shows the crude oil tanker Front Altair on fire in the Gulf of Oman today. It\u2019s come to us via the EPA news photo agency. Theresa May\u2019s spokesman has told reporters that Britain is \u201curgently seeking\u201d the facts behind today\u2019s suspected attacks on two tankers in the Gulf of Oman. Financial investors around the globe are closely watching developments in the Middle East today, says Mihir Kapadia, the CEO of Sun Global Investments: He warns that any US retaliation to today\u2019s tanker attacks could spook the markets (probably sending oil prices even higher). Tensions in the Middle-East have been rising since President Trump withdrew from the Iran deal last year, and this will certainly impact oil prices in the coming days as more developments come in. Although U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton has accused Iran of a similar incident before, the country has distanced itself from today\u2019s attacks. From this, the biggest concern will be a retaliation which could leave markets looking shaky in the meantime, with Iran potentially being met with more severe sanctions which could really affect its oil output and economy if found guilty.\u201d Dubai-based journalist Katie McQue has more details of the tankers: Cailin Birch, global economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit, fears today\u2019s attacks could deepen the tensions between Washington and Tehran. It remains unclear who the actors are behind the recent spate of tanker attacks in the Gulf of Oman. Iranian authorities will continue to deny responsibility, either directly or indirectly through proxies. Houthi rebels fighting Saudi forces in Yemen are also suspected of being behind the attacks. Given the lack of clear information, there is a risk that the US government will interpret the recent attacks as a potential sign of Iranian aggression in the region; the national security advisor, John Bolton, indicated as much after the attacks that occurred last month. US-Iran tensions are already running high as Iran\u2019s deadline to stop complying with some aspects of its nuclear agreement, unless European countries help it to maintain exports, approaches in the next 30 days. Shipping company Frontline has denied Iranian media reports that its Front Altair tanker has sunk, following today\u2019s suspected attack. The UK government has said it is deeply concerned by reports of explosions and fires on vessels in the Strait of Hormuz. Reuters has more details: Shipping firms and industry sources said two oil tankers were hit in suspected attacks in the Gulf of Oman and the crews have been evacuated, a month after a similar incident in which four tankers in the region were struck. \u201cWe are deeply concerned by reports of explosions and fires on vessels in the Strait of Hormuz. We are in contact with local authorities and partners in the region,\u201d as British government spokeswoman said. US crude oil prices have also risen sharply, as traders fret about disruption to supplies from the Middle East. Light sweet crude oil on the NYMEX exchange has jumped 3% to over $53 per barrel. The owner of Front Altair, Frontline, have said that their vessel is still on fire in the Gulf of Oman. Here\u2019s our diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour on today\u2019s drama: The US Navy\u2019s fifth fleet says it is assisting two damaged oil tankers reportedly hit by explosions off the coast of the United Arab Emirates near the strategic Strait of Hormuz. Reports of the explosions in the Gulf of Oman originally came from the same Hezbollah-linked news agencies in Lebanon that correctly reported attacks on four tankers docked off the coast of the UAE last month. The tankers in distress were the Marshal Islands-flagged Front Altair and the Panama-flagged Kokuka Courageous. Managers for the Panama shipping firm said 21 crew members had been evacuated, and the cargo of methanol was intact. The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, which is part of the Royal Navy, had earlier said that it was aware of an incident. The UK and its partners are currently investigating, the group said. Here\u2019s Patrick\u2019s full story: This map from Bloomberg TV shows where today\u2019s suspected attacks took place - and also May\u2019s suspected attack which the US blamed on Iran. Iran\u2019s state media are reporting that Iranian rescue vessels have rescued 44 crew members from the Kokuka Courageous and the Front Altair. Japan\u2019s trade ministry has weighed in: Co-incidentally, Japan\u2019s prime minister Shinzo Abe is visiting Iran today- the first such visit by a Japanese premier since the 1979 Islamic revolution. Abe has met Ayatollah Ali Khamenei today- according to this tweet from Iran\u2019s supreme leader. As you can see, Brent crude spiked sharply this morning when news that two tankers were in trouble in the Gulf of Oman reached the City: Here\u2019s what we know so far, via Marketwatch: Geopolitical tensions jolted the oil price on Thursday. Media reports said a tanker in the Gulf of Oman had sent a distress signal after being attacked and was on fire, while Bloomberg reported a second tanker had also been attacked after both had sailed from Saudi Arabia. United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, an arm of the Royal Navy, said it was investigating the incident after Iranian media also reported explosions in the area, the Associated Press reported. The U.S. Navy was aware of the incident, Bloomberg reported. Today\u2019s suspected attacks come a month after four ships were attacked outside the Strait of Hormuz (between UAE and Iran). Here\u2019s a map (from last month): U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton claimed two weeks ago that Iran was almost certainly responsible for the attacks, without presenting evidence to back up the claim. Iran, though, blamed \u201cadventurism\u201d by foreign players to disrupt maritime security. The incidents come amid rising geopolitical tensions in the region. President Trump has pulled out of the multinational nuclear pact with Iran and reimposed fresh sanctions on its economy, including a ban on oil sales. US Navy ships are racing to the two stricken tankers to help, as the financial markets continue to push the oil price up. Here\u2019s the official statement from the owner of the Kokuka Courageous, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement: Fortunately, there are reports that the crews of the two tankers are safe. Iranian media are reporting that TWO tankers have been hit in the Gulf of Oman. The Financial Times has more details: Iran\u2019s Arabic TV al-Alalam reported that Pakistan\u2019s local authorities also confirmed that the sound of explosions were heard. Shipping executives have been circulating messages on Thursday morning saying that oil tanker M.T Front Altair had been abandoned, with its crew safely rescued by a nearby vessel, and that it was fully loaded and on fire. The fire on Front Altair was caused by a \u201csurface attack\u201d, one of the messages said. The messages also said that a second tanker in the vicinity, Kokuka Courageous, could not be contacted, with its automatic identification system having gone offline. I\u2019ve dug into our Reuters terminal -- and found the two tankers. As you can see, Front Altair took a sudden diversion to the south this morning, presumably when the incident took place. Bloomberg is reporting that the tanker fire is being blamed on an \u201cattack\u201d. News that a tanker has caught fire in the Gulf of Oman is fuelling fears of geopolitical unrest in the region. Neil Wilson of Market.com explains: Oil has shot up sharply after slumping to 5-month lows overnight. Reports of an oil tanker being on fire in the Sea of Oman rattled markets and sent Brent up $2 in a matter of minute, but await to see whether this will hold or is an algo-based kneejerk that will be faded. We know that geopolitical tensions in the region are worsening and raise supply-side concerns in terms of short-term outages etc \u2013 but with OPEC already curbing output and US production at a record high the market is far less susceptible to a shock. Newsflash: The oil price has just surged on reports that a tanker in the Gulf of Oman is on fire. Details of the incident are sketchy, beyond that it happened near the Iranian coast. But markets are reacting fast. Brent crude has surged over 3% to $62 per barrel, having hit a five-month low below $60 last night. This month\u2019s survey of Britain\u2019s chartered surveyors is peppered with references to Brexit - here\u2019s a round-up of comments: Paul McSkimmings of Edward Watson Associates in Newcastle upon Tyne, Good month with expected levels of instructions despite continuing uncertainty due to Brexit. I am still expecting a significant drop in work if Brexit eventually staggers over the line Jonathan Milner of Paisley Properties in Huddersfield Usual Easter bump continues. Demand remains strong, no Brexit jitters on the whole. Level second hand stock coming to market, whilst new build is increasingly popular. Ben Hudson of Hudson Moody in York: A realisation that Brexit will rumble on for ever has meant buyers and sellers are starting to make decisions to move. James Brown of Norman F Brown in Richmond: The shortage of new property on the market continues however following the Brexit postponement, buyers seem to have reacted positively and some properties are selling quickly at good prices. Andrew W York of Moore &amp; York in Leicester: Upturn in sales during the second half of the month, but will this continue with all the political/ Brexit uncertainty? Simon Rubinsohn, RICS Chief Economist, says today\u2019s survey shows the UK housing market is recovering. But even though RICS sees prices recovering, Brexit is still a concern, he says: \u201cSome comfort can be drawn from the results of the latest RICS survey as it suggests that the housing market in aggregate may be steading. However much of the anecdotal insight provided by respondents is still quite cautious, reflecting concerns about both the underlying political and economic climate. Rubinsohn also warns that some house-prices sellers are demanding too much for their homes, helping to bung the market up: \u201cAnother significant point made by respondents is that there continues to be considerable emphasis on the need for realistic pricing on the part of vendors, which while not a new story, is indicative of the ongoing challenges. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The Brexit storm clouds that have loomed over Britain\u2019s economy for many months appears to be clearing. A new survey of chartered surveyors shows that the housing sector recovered its nerve in May. Prices picked up on relief that the UK hadn\u2019t crashed out of the EU without a deal this spring. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) house price measure - the difference between members reporting price rises and falls - improved to -10 from -22 in April. That was its highest reading since October and was stronger than the City expected. It suggests that the steady downward pressure on house prices may be easing. London\u2019s housing market has taken the biggest hit from Brexit since 2016, but there are also sign that the long slump in the capital\u2019s housing market may have bottomed out. RICS says: New buyer enquiries steadier in May following recent declines South East now showing most negative sentiment on prices as London starts to bounce back Indicators on sales, prices and new instructions remain slightly negative, but less than previously Expectations point to a gradual improvement in activity over the next twelve months Reaction to follow... Also coming up today We\u2019ll be tracking events at Arcadia, after Philip Green finally persuaded his landlords to agree hefty rent cuts to keep the company running. On the economic side, we get new eurozone factory output data and the latest US weekly jobless total.

The ceremonial robes are maroon today, which signifies danger. Someone has to tell him. Someone Has To Tell Him Justin Bieber Wants A Fight.</p> <p>\u201cEnter,\u201d Cruise says. \u201cSpeak.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour worship, I \u2013 \u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I \u2013 \u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p> <p>It is explained very slowly to him: on Twitter (\u201cA high-profile social media platform for Nazis, sir. The studio were very keen you sign up for it. Simon Pegg\u2019s on there\u201d), Justin Bieber (\u201cA hyper-popular slow-motion breakdown in the body of a child-turned-superstar, sir\u201d) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/justinbieber/status/1137880621848584193\" title=\"\">has challenged Tom Cruise to an MMA fight</a> (\u201cA sort of legitimised prison scrap, my liege. You cannot scoop an eyeball, but that\u2019s about it\u201d). Three rounds, five minutes, slim-to-no rules. You cannot wear a shirt. You cannot fish-hook a mouth. You punch Justin Bieber until they have to flash a torch in his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cWe take the fight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSir, reading it back, I really think it was more a very deranged jo \u2013 \u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe take. The fight.\u201d</p> <p>And so the training begins. Bieber\u2019s camp is notified (\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a real challenge!\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jul/12/justin-bieber-manager-scooter-braun-ariana-grande-kanye-west\" title=\"\">Scooter Braun</a> says, sweating into a phone. \u201cHe just hadn\u2019t slept! Call off Tom Cruise!\u201d) and Cruise rises at 5am. Shuttle-runs up the temple steps. Pint glasses filled with raw egg yolks. So far, the normal Cruise routine. But then he intensifies: speedbags, log lifts, a daily session where five or six devotees try to snap at his skin with a belt. \u201cCarbon becomes diamond through pressure,\u201d Cruise spits through his teeth. \u201cIron when blasted becomes steel.\u201d He hasn\u2019t eaten in days. He hasn\u2019t slept in weeks. At night, he prowls along the ramparts like a panther, feral at the moon.</p> <p>Bieber, for his part, embraces the inevitable. After a bungled attempt to leave the country (an Instagram Live stream of him boarding a private jet is overwhelmed with the same comment, over and over and over: \u201cTOM CRUISE WILL FIND YOU\u201d), he turns around, shrugs into a grey hoodie, and starts some tentative fight training.</p> <p>At the core of both protagonists, the same iron truth: they are more similar than they would like to admit. Both men love their gods with an intensity that borders on the feverish. Both are electric bolts of charismatic energy in the bodies and faces of the top 1,000 most attractive men to ever live. They have both been hyper-famous since their youths and had their minds and sanities unutterably contorted by that. A 31-year age gap, two industries pushing up against the edges of each other but never overlapping, two human franchises squeezed together in one eight-sided ring. The chance is that they enter <a href=\"https://www.ufc.com/octagon\" title=\"\">the UFC Octagon</a> and something beautiful happens: like wild animals, they recognise the primal strand of shared consciousness between them and quietly and tenderly hug. But Cruise has just started dipping his knuckles in vinegar to try to harden the skin around them. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to hug,\u201d he says, blindfolded and spryly dodging knives being thrown at him by shaven-headed pilgrims. \u201cWe simply will not hug.\u201d</p> <p>Fight night down in Vegas. Desert heat mixed with the aftershave smell of the hotel foyers. All the lights are on and buzzing. Limousines honk at each other on the sizzling roads. The palpable smell of violence as the wind dies slowly around them. The crowd, a many-legged beast stomping in unison, is chanting the same war scream over and over: \u201cCruise! Cruise! Cruise!\u201d Backstage, Tom is focused: wrists wrapped, knuckles clenched, chewed raw steak being spat into his mouth like a baby bird.

      "bodyText": "Dignitaries and handlers alike flock to the central temple where Tom Cruise spends 18 hours of every day sleeping still with his eyes wide open. The ceremonial robes are maroon today, which signifies danger. Someone has to tell him. Someone Has To Tell Him Justin Bieber Wants A Fight. \u201cEnter,\u201d Cruise says. \u201cSpeak.\u201d \u201cYour worship, I \u2013 \u201d \u201cWhat is it?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m afraid I \u2013 \u201d \u201cWhat is it?\u201d It is explained very slowly to him: on Twitter (\u201cA high-profile social media platform for Nazis, sir. The studio were very keen you sign up for it. Simon Pegg\u2019s on there\u201d), Justin Bieber (\u201cA hyper-popular slow-motion breakdown in the body of a child-turned-superstar, sir\u201d) has challenged Tom Cruise to an MMA fight (\u201cA sort of legitimised prison scrap, my liege. You cannot scoop an eyeball, but that\u2019s about it\u201d). Three rounds, five minutes, slim-to-no rules. You cannot wear a shirt. You cannot fish-hook a mouth. You punch Justin Bieber until they have to flash a torch in his eyes. \u201cWe take the fight.\u201d \u201cSir, reading it back, I really think it was more a very deranged jo \u2013 \u201d \u201cWe take. The fight.\u201d And so the training begins. Bieber\u2019s camp is notified (\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a real challenge!\u201d Scooter Braun says, sweating into a phone. \u201cHe just hadn\u2019t slept! Call off Tom Cruise!\u201d) and Cruise rises at 5am. Shuttle-runs up the temple steps. Pint glasses filled with raw egg yolks. So far, the normal Cruise routine. But then he intensifies: speedbags, log lifts, a daily session where five or six devotees try to snap at his skin with a belt. \u201cCarbon becomes diamond through pressure,\u201d Cruise spits through his teeth. \u201cIron when blasted becomes steel.\u201d He hasn\u2019t eaten in days. He hasn\u2019t slept in weeks. At night, he prowls along the ramparts like a panther, feral at the moon. Bieber, for his part, embraces the inevitable. After a bungled attempt to leave the country (an Instagram Live stream of him boarding a private jet is overwhelmed with the same comment, over and over and over: \u201cTOM CRUISE WILL FIND YOU\u201d), he turns around, shrugs into a grey hoodie, and starts some tentative fight training. At the core of both protagonists, the same iron truth: they are more similar than they would like to admit. Both men love their gods with an intensity that borders on the feverish. Both are electric bolts of charismatic energy in the bodies and faces of the top 1,000 most attractive men to ever live. They have both been hyper-famous since their youths and had their minds and sanities unutterably contorted by that. A 31-year age gap, two industries pushing up against the edges of each other but never overlapping, two human franchises squeezed together in one eight-sided ring. The chance is that they enter the UFC Octagon and something beautiful happens: like wild animals, they recognise the primal strand of shared consciousness between them and quietly and tenderly hug. But Cruise has just started dipping his knuckles in vinegar to try to harden the skin around them. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to hug,\u201d he says, blindfolded and spryly dodging knives being thrown at him by shaven-headed pilgrims. \u201cWe simply will not hug.\u201d Fight night down in Vegas. Desert heat mixed with the aftershave smell of the hotel foyers. All the lights are on and buzzing. Limousines honk at each other on the sizzling roads. The palpable smell of violence as the wind dies slowly around them. The crowd, a many-legged beast stomping in unison, is chanting the same war scream over and over: \u201cCruise! Cruise! Cruise!\u201d Backstage, Tom is focused: wrists wrapped, knuckles clenched, chewed raw steak being spat into his mouth like a baby bird. His entrance music is an audio recording of an electrocution. The first round is just a tease. Cruise, head shaved and body neatly waxed (he seems to be covered in a thin layer of oil or grease? He seems to have \u2026 human blood smeared on his face like eye-black?), toys with Bieber, letting him spray punches towards him while he darts backwards around the Octagon \u2013 on the cards, judges award the first round to the singer.

At the Hampshire Bowl \u2013 as it is called throughout the World Cup \u2013 England meet West Indies and the sixes have to come off the middle of the bat, which satisfies our sense of justice. This ground can boast one of the largest playing surfaces for international cricket in the country now the Oval and the County Ground at Bristol have shrunk.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/12/moeen-ali-daughter-birth-west-indies-cricket-world-cup\">Moeen Ali back from daughter\u2019s birth and ready to face West Indies</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Still, there will be sixes for sure. Since the 2007 World Cup sixes have easily outnumbered maidens. We just do not quite know from whose bat they will spring on Friday. Chris Gayle if he stays in is bound to hit some. Who else? Andre Russell (if fit)? Jos Buttler (who is fit)? Liam Plunkett (if selected)? They can all clear the boundary. Meanwhile the maiden has become a rare and precious commodity. Curiously I\u2019m getting as much excitement from the possibility of a maiden in this World Cup than another clunk over the boundary.</p> \n<p>The size and shape of the ground can now dictate the pattern of the game. At Cardiff bowlers resort to banging the ball into the pitch short of a length, in an attempt to compel batsmen to hit the ball square of the wicket where the boundaries are long. In Adelaide they encourage batsmen to drive straight for the same reason. At the Hampshire Bowl it is a long way to the rope wherever you aim. Shrewd batsmen and captains take this into account.</p> \n<p>This may suit West Indies. Their plan is easy to decipher but tricky to combat. They like to bowl first and fast. They use the short ball liberally, which poses a constant dilemma to the batsmen: whether to hook or to sway out of the way. There is no respite for the square-leg umpire when West Indies are bowling; he must be constantly alert to decide whether the ball is passing the batsman over head height, in which case he must indicate to his colleague that it should be called a wide.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"191650fad514699fc4476bf4f549c263ff9df68a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/191650fad514699fc4476bf4f549c263ff9df68a/249_219_3019_1811/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow displayed considerable patience when starting England\u2019s innings against Bangladesh.

But at the Hampshire Bowl there is the necessity for batsmen either to middle the ball or ensure they keep it on the turf whenever they take on the short ball.

      "bodyText": "A big game on a big ground against some big blokes. At the Hampshire Bowl \u2013 as it is called throughout the World Cup \u2013 England meet West Indies and the sixes have to come off the middle of the bat, which satisfies our sense of justice. This ground can boast one of the largest playing surfaces for international cricket in the country now the Oval and the County Ground at Bristol have shrunk. Still, there will be sixes for sure. Since the 2007 World Cup sixes have easily outnumbered maidens. We just do not quite know from whose bat they will spring on Friday. Chris Gayle if he stays in is bound to hit some. Who else? Andre Russell (if fit)? Jos Buttler (who is fit)? Liam Plunkett (if selected)? They can all clear the boundary. Meanwhile the maiden has become a rare and precious commodity. Curiously I\u2019m getting as much excitement from the possibility of a maiden in this World Cup than another clunk over the boundary. The size and shape of the ground can now dictate the pattern of the game. At Cardiff bowlers resort to banging the ball into the pitch short of a length, in an attempt to compel batsmen to hit the ball square of the wicket where the boundaries are long. In Adelaide they encourage batsmen to drive straight for the same reason. At the Hampshire Bowl it is a long way to the rope wherever you aim. Shrewd batsmen and captains take this into account. This may suit West Indies. Their plan is easy to decipher but tricky to combat. They like to bowl first and fast. They use the short ball liberally, which poses a constant dilemma to the batsmen: whether to hook or to sway out of the way. There is no respite for the square-leg umpire when West Indies are bowling; he must be constantly alert to decide whether the ball is passing the batsman over head height, in which case he must indicate to his colleague that it should be called a wide. On the smaller grounds batsmen are likely to hook and pull with greater frequency in the knowledge that even a top edge has a fair chance of clearing the boundary. But at the Hampshire Bowl there is the necessity for batsmen either to middle the ball or ensure they keep it on the turf whenever they take on the short ball. Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow displayed considerable patience and discretion when starting England\u2019s innings against Bangladesh at Cardiff last week before accelerating in fine style. They must aim to show the same qualities against West Indies, albeit against a very different type of attack. Mind you, the West Indies batsmen may face a similar test when they bat.

While talking about his side\u2019s opening-day trip to Bournemouth, Sheffield United\u2019s finest wore a flat cap and a T-shirt that said: \u2018Every three weeks I need my hair cuttin.\u2019 No, really. Norwich\u2019s supporter was too busy making faces at the Villa fan\u2019s suggestion that Jack Grealish was the best player in the Championship to actually contribute anything of note. If that didn\u2019t get your blood pumping, just wait until you hear about the new 7.45pm kick-off times on a Saturday night. That one should go down a treat with the hard-won audiences in Asia. Or what about the news that you\u2019ll have to get another subscription if you want to watch all the televised games? Don\u2019t mind if we do! It wasn\u2019t even the most dismal league update of the day, what with the news that France\u2019s top flight will be renamed \u2018Ligue Urrrrrrrn Uber Eats\u2019 in 2020-21, with the match ball for each game brought on the pitch by a delivery man. It. Never. Ends. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Kieran Pender from 5pm BST for flamin\u2019 MBM coverage of Australia 1-3 Brazil, while Niall McVeigh will be on hand at 8pm for South Africa 0-1 China. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cWe had a turnout of about 40-50 people. There were good vibes\u201d \u2013 manager Danny Rodriguez is left to clutch at the positives after his American Social bar in Miami offered \u201cfree shots for every [USA! USA!!

RECOMMENDED LISTENING It\u2019s Football. Weekly. Extraaaaaaa! FIVER LETTERS \u201cI would like to invite you be the guest team at our small but perfectly formed football tournament. It is here in Oxford on Sunday 23 June. All proceeds to a local hospice. And a BBQ with Polish sausages, you won\u2019t get that at the Copa Am\u00e9rica\u201d \u2013 Peter Hart [will check in with our cousins \u2013 Fiver Ed]. \u201cI noticed that Fiverr International Ltd has completed its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange. I thought that maybe this share offering was related to a certain tea-timely email. However, some cursory research shows that this Fiverr launched on time, was well-received by the public (up 45% as of now) and, despite describing themselves as a marketplace for online services, is not a place to buy Tin or other adult beverages\u201d \u2013 R Reisman. \u201cHats off to The Fiver for maintaining its usual levels of journalistic rigour by failing to give a single mention to Norn Iron\u2019s six-point haul from two tricky away games in tough conditions in June, with a number of the squad barely having seen a football pitch since April, thereby further cementing (if it were needed) the managerial acumen of Michael O\u2019Neill. Not even a mention in what we were told were talking points from the last week of men\u2019s internationals. Keep up the \u2018work\u2019\u201d \u2013 James Irwin. \u201cIf James Maltby was perturbed by the results when he Googled \u2018Cantona D!cks Challenge\u2019 (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters), imagine my surprise on trying to research the campaign by Fulham fans in 1991 against their manager Alan D1cks. You should see what \u2018Cottagers D!cks out\u2019 turns up\u201d \u2013 Michael Hann. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 James Irwin. BITS AND BOBS Oystons out! Simon Sadler has completed his takeover of Blackpool. Forest Green chairman Dale Vince is feeling funky after Stroud District Council gave short shrift to planning permission for a 5,000-seater wooden stadium. \u201cIt is a poor show,\u201d he sighed. \u201cMaybe we will appeal but that is another year of my life. How hard should I have to try to bring some progress? I do wonder if it is worth the effort.\u201d The damage done to English football\u2019s nicotine-to-club manager ratio by Maurizio Sarri\u2019s potential exit to Juventus has been offset by Slaven Bilic\u2019s arrival at West Brom on a two-year deal. \u201cI didn\u2019t think twice once they had spoken to me,\u201d he puffed. France centre-back Wendie Renard says her comedy own goal in their 2-1 Women\u2019s World Cup win over Norway proves the team needs to keep focus. \u201cIt shows that you need to keep your feet on the ground,\u201d she tooted when, as it turns out, doing the opposite might have spared her blushes. Standard Li\u00e8ge winger Moussa Djenepo is now \u00a314m Southampton winger Moussa Djenepo. \u201cIt is a dream come true,\u201d he roared. Bolton\u2019s administrators say they have had a suitable offer for the club but are keeping quiet about who it is from. \u201cThe preferred bidder has both the financial ability and the determination to turn around the club,\u201d administrated an administrator. And Denis Su\u00e1rez has echoed the thoughts of most Arsenal fans by describing his season at the club as \u201cone to forget\u201d, blaming pelvis-knack for his disappointing spell. \u201cI don\u2019t think I was even at 50%,\u201d he yelped. STILL WANT MORE? Why did Argentina celebrate their 0-0 World Cup draw with Japan so joyfully?Joshua Nadel and Brenda Elsey reveal the team\u2019s long battle against sexism. \u201cWe had a bath in pink champagne!\u201d How Denmark won the 1971 Women\u2019s World Cup, by Paul Doyle.

      "bodyText": "An influential committee of MPs has criticised the government for its failure to curb \u201cextravagant\u201d boardroom pay packages. In a report in March, the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee argued companies must do more to link leading executives\u2019 pay to that of the rest of their workforce. In her response, Kelly Tolhurst, the minister for small business, consumers and corporate responsibility, said: \u201cOur immediate priority is to focus on the effective implementation and then assessment of these reforms before considering any significant further changes.\u201d She noted public companies now have to disclose and explain the ratio of their chief executive\u2019s annual remuneration to the average pay of staff, while the Investment Association has set up a public register of shareholder revolts over pay. However, Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said: \u201cThe government\u2019s response to our report on executive pay represents a missed opportunity to rein in bosses\u2019 pay and link CEO pay to that of the rest of their workforce. \u201cThe public are rightly appalled by extravagant CEO pay packages. The success of a business is rarely solely down to the chief executive and there should be greater efforts to ensure that workers have a share in the profits too.\u201d MPs argue a series of \u201cshaming\u201d decisions \u2013 including the attempt by the housebuilder Persimmon to pay its former chief executive Jeff Fairburn a bonus of \u00a3110m \u2013 have shown the need for stricter limits on executive pay. The BEIS committee has called for greater use of profit-sharing schemes, a reduction of \u201cvariable pay\u201d bonuses over time, an absolute cap on chief executives\u2019 remuneration and giving employees a say in how their senior executives are paid. Reeves said: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing the government has chosen to reject our recommendation that workers should sit on company pay committees. The appointment of a worker would bring some much-needed scepticism, challenge and perspective on executive rewards and help to curb some of the extravagant CEO pay packages we have seen in recent years.\u201d The government said several companies were already inviting employee representatives to attend at least one remuneration committee meeting a year. It added that the huge variety of companies meant \u201cone method will not suit all\u201d. Theresa May vowed to put worker representatives on the boards of major companies when she campaigned to become prime minister in 2016, but the plan was ditched last year after lobbying from the CBI. The government also said in its response to the committee\u2019s report that remuneration committees and shareholders should decide on an absolute cap on total pay, with shareholders having a say through the binding vote on executive pay policies every three years. It rejected MPs\u2019 recommendation to extend pay ratio reporting to all employers with more than 250 staff and to include the lowest pay band, saying it \u201cintends to monitor the impact\u201d before considering extending pay ratio reporting.",

We can\u2019t just design better policy \u2013 to build a more just world, we need to take power from the control of the rich and democratize it.

But his simple message reflected the moral clarity and vision of the old Socialist party: Richard Nixon represented \u201cmillionaires and billionaires\u201d, as Sanders said at the time, and propped up a \u201cworld of the 2% of the population that owns more than one-third of the personally held wealth in America\u201d.</p> <p>We\u2019re used to politicians that vacillate, triangulate, \u201cevolve\u201d.

Yet in 1944, shortly before his death, Roosevelt put forth a sweeping manifesto he called the Second Bill of Rights.

The Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s final report into RBS\u2019s now-defunct Global Restructuring Group (GRG) said it would take no action against the lender or senior staff despite evidence of \u201csystemic and widespread\u201d mistreatment of small- and medium-sized business customers between 2008 and 2013. \u201cThe firm\u2019s relations with its customers were often insensitive, dismissive and sometimes too aggressive; these failings made an already stressful situation worse,\u201d said Andrew Bailey, the regulator\u2019s chief executive. The FCA also found that RBS failed to manage a conflict of interest involving the bank\u2019s property firm, West Register, which was used to buy assets from distressed companies \u2013 including companies that had been diverted into the GRG unit. However, the FCA dismissed allegations that the bank pushed thousands of business customers into administration in order to strip them of their assets and buy them more cheaply. In some cases, victims say they were forced to restructure loans that resulted in extortionate fees and higher interest rates, which pushed them further into financial difficulty or administration. The Conservative MP Kevin Hollinrake hit out at the FCA\u2019s conclusions and decision to withhold names of senior managers he said were responsible for the mistreatment of thousands of SMEs. The co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on fair business banking and finance said: \u201cThis report is another complete whitewash and another demonstrable failure of the regulator to perform its role.\u201d The SME Alliance, a small business pressure group, said it was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d that despite evidence of mistreatment, no bankers had been held to account. \u201c[The FCA] seems to have concluded none of RBS, its staff or its senior management could or should be held accountable in any way.

Clive May, a victim of the GRG unit, said he was not surprised by the FCA\u2019s response, given his experience with the regulator throughout his \u201clong, arduous journey\u201d trying to get to the bottom of a case he believes amounts to fraud. \u201cI was never really thinking the FCA were likely to do anything.\u201d The north Wales-based bricklayer said RBS pushed him into taking a special government-backed loan in 2010 before cutting his overdraft limit.

The FCA said RBS was \u201cunder unprecedented stress\u201d after its government bailout during the 2008 financial crisis, when the number of customers entering the GRG unit surged. Bailey stressed that RBS has taken action and responded to the FCA\u2019s recommendations. But with commercial lending still unregulated in the UK, business customers do not fall under the financial watchdog\u2019s jurisdiction. That anomaly has allowed RBS and GRG\u2019s senior managers to escape disciplinary action despite evidence of mistreatment in the FCA\u2019s report. The FCA\u2019s investigation, first launched in 2014, said the regulator was ultimately powerless to take action, given that business lending is outside its jurisdiction. The Treasury select committee has urged the government to reconsider regulating business lending. \u201cOtherwise, scandalous events such as those at GRG could recur,\u201d said Nicky Morgan, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee. Bailey said businesses should take comfort in new rules, including the new senior managers and certification regime,which he said would now help hold misbehaving bankers to account. He also highlighted the extended powers granted to the Financial Ombudsman Service, which now covers complaints from a wider range of SMEs. However, the FCA has refused to speculate whether it would have punished RBS under the new rules. \u201cWe cannot say whether we would have been able to bring successful cases against RBS senior management,\u201d it said.

      "bodyText": "Testing carried out by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism around eight dairy units in the UK has revealed ammonia hotspots at three of them. The government does not monitor ammonia pollution from most UK farms, despite the fact that it is a major contributor to the air pollution crisis. The Bureau tested emissions at six intensive units housing more than 700 cattle, another farm where a confinement unit permanently houses some of the herd, and one conventional farm with dairy cows grazing. Ammonia hotspots were detected at two of the intensive units, including sites near an uncovered slurry storage tank and near a farmyard, and at various points around the outdoor dairy farm, including next to a farm building, on a road running through the farm, and by a waste lagoon. These findings provide only a small snapshot across the south of England, and emissions readings can be influenced by many variables including the weather, but they highlight the need for mandatory emissions monitoring on farms if the ammonia problem is to be reduced. Mark Sutton, environmental physicist at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, said: \u201cIntensive systems will give bigger emissions in general, as they are associated with livestock housing, manure storage and manure spreading, all of which tend to increase emissions compared to an animal grazing out in the field.\u201d Housed systems for cattle and pigs produce more ammonia as the urine and faeces mix, producing slurry. This mixture is more toxic than if the excreta were separated, as they effectively are when animals graze naturally because the urine is largely absorbed by the grass. Ammonia is emitted when slurry is stored in uncovered lagoons, and when it is sprayed on fields \u2013 muck-spreading \u2013 for fertilisation. Intensive poultry farms, however, can have some advantages over free range farms when it comes to ammonia, because when hens wander outside the ammonia from their excrement can disperse into the air, according to Simon Bareham, principal adviser on air quality and biodiversity at the government body Natural Resources Wales. Many farmers lack the financial resources to invest in lowering ammonia emissions. One diary farmer in north Devon said: \u201cPay a better price for the product we produce. If the milk price went up by 10-15% we could all look after the environment a lot better.\u201d He installed a cover on his slurry lagoon two years ago at a cost of \u00a335,000 - which would have been well out of his price range had it not been for a grant from the government.

      "bodyText": "Tree-planting in England fell well short of targets in the past year new figures show, despite government promises to restore and plant new woodland across the country to combat the climate change crisis. Only 1,420 hectares (3,507 acres) of trees were planted in England in the year to March 2019, against the government\u2019s target of 5,000 hectares in the period, with smaller areas in Wales and Northern Ireland, at 500 hectares and 240 hectares respectively. The total tree cover of the UK is unchanged at 10% in England, 15% in Wales, 19% in Scotland and 8% in Northern Ireland. However Scotland did far better, with 11,200 hectares planted, taking the UK\u2019s total to 13,400 hectares, the highest level overall in the last decade. Michael Gove, the environment secretary, has promised a national campaign of tree-planting, with pledges from the government of \u00a350m for 10m new rural trees and \u00a310m for 130,000 urban trees by 2022. Setting out measures the UK will need to implement to achieve the net-zero carbon target, which is shortly to be enshrined in legislation, the Committee on Climate Change said 1.5bn trees would be needed by 2050, equivalent to an area of 30,000 hectares every year, with 15% of crop land turned to tree-planting and growing plants for fuel. The Woodland Trust, which planted half of the new broadleaf woodland for England last year, called for much greater government support for tree-planting. Farmers in England face complex choices over tree-planting, because they get little support for it owing to the way the government has implemented the EU\u2019s common agricultural policy. They are also uncertain over Brexit \u2013 the government has promised \u201cpublic money for public goods\u201d in a new agricultural system after Brexit, but there is little detail on how this will work and the new \u201cenvironmental land management contracts\u201d will only be phased in from 2024, which leaves a gap in the potential support available.

It gets them one point, which can be handy for teams that need a tie-breaker to qualify for a semi-final. But New Zealand already have a vastly better net run rate than anyone in the tournament, so if they do end up level on points then it\u2019s a win for the Land of the Long White Cloud.</p> <p>As for India, they miss out on a chance to go three from three, and slot in right behind En Zed at the head of the table. For now the Indians have five points, sitting third behind Australian and ahead of England. It\u2019s a handy point for them, but they would have backed themselves to beat New Zealand, and they would have enjoyed the workout against another strong team after knocking off the Aussies in London last weekend.</p> <p>As for the rest of us, we\u2019ve been deprived of a truly tasty match-up between New Zealand\u2019s excellent pace attack and India\u2019s powerful batting. Ferguson, Henry, Boult slinging the ball down at Rohit, Kohli, Dhoni... a damn shame. Not to mention Ross Taylor\u2019s red-hot form against Jasprit Bumrah and Bhuvi Kumar. The pitch would have been zippy for fast bowlers, and the cloud cover might have introduced another element. </p> <p>But no good. We may not see these two teams play at all in this World Cup, unless they meet again in the finals. A crying shame.</p> <p>Enough rain now, everyone.

I remember covering as a young reporter Northants v the New Zealand tourists in the early 1970s when it was a lovely sunny day from early morning and there was no play until 3pm because of fussy umpires. Gave me time for a good interview with Richard Hadlee but really pissed off spectators. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe grounds have improved greatly since then with modern drainage but the past week has again shown there is no way of guarding against terrible weather. A long tournament like this was always going to be at risk of descending into a soggy anticlimax. I have memories of freezing in press boxes at early season county matches and watching the downpours.

You want to consider average days of rain &gt; 1mm. This is more useful as Australian rain in March is likely more intense, leading to less time actually raining. By my reckoning Sydney has 9.9 such days in March on average, and London 7.4. So whilst London has half as much average rainfall in volume, it\u2019s likely spread out across more days, and hence the chance of rain affecting the play is not all that different. PS: thoughts on how happy this washout might make the Kiwis?\u201d</p> <p>Quite so. But if the chance of rain is not all that different, it still derails the rather silly argument that we shouldn\u2019t play cricket in England, the place where it was invented, in June, the month where more of it has been played than any other.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d0253eb8f08ec09b0d195c8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-13T13:47:27.206Z\">2.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And a couple more ticket price emails, which have some very useful detail. Thanks everyone. Starting with Andrew Cosgrove.<br></p> <p>\u201cPrices for tickets were in line with perceived demand, so the most expensive matches were those involving England, India and Pakistan. On the other hand, I don\u2019t think Ind vs Pak was any more expensive than Eng vs Anyone. There were about four bands of prices, with the lower one being cheap - tickets for \u00a318 were available, mostly for games involving Afghanistan or Bangladesh. It doesn\u2019t seem that unreasonable. India vs Pakistan was the most oversubscribed sporting event in this country since the 2012 Olympics, making the tickets cheaper just would have made it carnage.\u201d</p> <p>I can understand that logic, but the unfortunate corollary is that it reduces demand by financial clout. So basically it\u2019s a sporting body saying it will alleviate the pressure by limiting access to wealthier people. Not exactly an unprecedented strategy in our society, but not one that survives ethical scrutiny for me.</p> <p>Ishfaq Razzak, meanwhile, writes that \u201cit\u2019s been really difficult to get tickets through the ballot but I get it, everyone wants tickets and it\u2019s a fair way of doing it. I managed to get tickets to the Pakistan v Sri Lanka match (rained off) at \u00a320 but the Pakistan v India match was close to a hundred! Pakistan v India is the hottest ticket around, I\u2019ve seen offers at \u00a3800 (that\u2019s cheap) to \u00a31700 for Gold tickets.</p> <p>\u201cIt looks like the punters that have bought extra tickets are selling for at least double, I bought Pakistan v NZ at \u00a340 ea whereas face value is \u00a320. It\u2019s been 20 years since the last World Cup here so I guess there\u2019s no other way to buy tickets from friends / touts if you don\u2019t get selected. I paid \u00a395 (face value) to a friend who managed to get Pakistan v Bangladesh at Lord\u2019s on 5th July. Warner stand, terrace, front row, Gold tickets. Seems like an okay price when compared to football ticket prices. Friend is selling the remaining two tickets at \u00a3150 each and he\u2019s getting lots of interest. See you at Lord\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed.

The interesting part is that every cricket country has rain, and washouts, and abandonments. I seem to recall sitting through a lot of rained out Tests over Boxing Day and the New Year\u2019s week in Melbourne and Sydney. A lot of two-session days in Sri Lanka. The 2016 World T20 in India, where they played that blockbuster against Pakistan at what felt like midnight after delaying and delaying a rain-affected start in Kolkata. That was after a decision a week or so earlier to move the match from Dharamsala, where I was stationed, and where I can attest that we saw more than our share of Himalayan rain, deluges, and a massive hailstorm that blocked the roads in and out of town for a night.</p> <p>So, yes. Rain. It happens. Sometimes more and sometimes less than others. Maybe English grounds could look at covering their whole outfields though, so we could have got some play during the reprieves on a day like this. The rain seems to have stopped, incidentally. But even if we had full ground covers today, I can\u2019t see that we could have got more than about 20 overs in so far.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d02496f8f080adae4897625\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-13T13:05:09.367Z\">2.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It\u2019s testament to the hardy types that cricket attracts that there are any people still at the ground.

A pretty little dilemma for the ICC, eh?\u201d</p> <p>If my decade in politics taught me one thing, whenever you go through a process like this, eventually, at some stage, you end up drawing lots.

He\u2019s not keen. \u201cI am an engineer, but not of the structural persuasion. Greatest challenges with implementing a temporary roof are matters such as the mechanics required for relatively quick setup or breakdown (rain cover times 20), man-power wouldn\u2019t cut it and the machines required would have to be integrated with the structure of the stadium (including lighting). Cost and inconvenience would lead architects to rather install a permanent roof. But indoor cricket is another matter; how high would the roof have to be? Will grass-care be assured? What will the white-clad Test Match officials have to say about this sudden change? It\u2019s just not on.\u201d</p> <p>Drones, though. Drones with tarps. With gutters that manage the flow. Et voila!</p> <p>Last but not least for now, M. B. Anand with his <strong>first ever email to the OBO! </strong>Welcome to the club. Make sure it is not your last.<br></p> <p>\u201cVery interesting ideas - holding up a tarp with drones or balloons,\u201d he begins. \u201cSome quick calculations below to check feasibility:</p> <p>1) Drones - <br></p> <p>Problem is power. Considering most stay aloft for about half hour and the very best, costing around $7500, can last no more than a couple of hours before needing re-juicing, this is likely to be a problem.</p> <p>Of course, we could arrange a complicated \u201cchange of guard\u201d as drones rotate in and out constantly....<br></p> <p>2) Hot air balloon -</p> <p>Representative heavy duty tarp weight = 18 oz. per square yard</p> <p>With a ground, say a circle of about 80m, the tarp weight is about 12183 kg. <br></p> <p>Given that a cubic foot of air lofts about 7 g of weight, this translates to a large spherical balloon of about 150 ft. in diameter. About a third of the size of the ground. Or many smaller ones that add up to the same volume. That seems quite feasible. Balloon wins, I think. Let\u2019s do this!\u201d</p> <p>This started with a shadecloth in space and has morphed into a hot air balloon. I\u2019m proud of the progression.

Adelaide, Basin Reserve, Newlands, Eden Gardens etc. The Himachal Pradesh ground at Dharamasala is spectacular, but for all that, my favourite ground I\u2019ve ever been to is the old Rec in Antigua. Full of noise and colour as you sat there in the sun with a gentle breeze, drinking a beer, looking out over the Caribbean and watching the Windies play a test match. Such a shame it\u2019s gone.

Arranged in a circle with one in the middle that would fly highest to allow runoff, these drones take flight and hoist the tarp above the entire ground. This could play havoc with<em>lateral movement</em> of the ball, so once in place, the roof would have to remain for the duration of the match, much like on Centre Court.

When I arrived here last night in the motor home that took me from Taunton to Nottingham, we didn\u2019t think so. It was torrential. It was biblical. It was not fit for the sport we love. However, despite mizzle and drizzle and all the rest over the last couple of hours, it hasn\u2019t poured. There\u2019s a gentle breeze running across Trent Bridge. We\u2019re a chance. Probably not at the scheduled starting time of 10:30am, but provided this break of sorts in the weather continues, I think we\u2019re a big hope of getting on. At a modern ground like Trent Bridge, perhaps sooner than might be the case if we were at a non-Test venue. </p> <p>With expectations so cruelly built up like that, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll bucket down as soon as I hit send. But if we don\u2019t, both teams have a big opportunity to take advantage of the washouts from earlier in the week by claiming two points and remaining undefeated. Whoever does might already have a couple of toes into the final four. </p> <p>In Blackcaps land, they\u2019re fit and firing. Tim Southee - the Lennon to Trent Boult\u2019s McCartney in the swing stakes - is fit and available. They\u2019d be made not to pick both of them on a morning like this. Alongside Lockie Ferguson - the quickest bowler in the World Cup so far - and Matt Henry, that\u2019s quite the quartet. </p> <p>India boast similar selection riches. Well, with the ball at least. They are, however, missing Shikhar Dhawan with a thumb injury for a couple of games, which he acquired when stroking a gorgeous ton against Australia on Sunday. The margin of victory there (36 runs) should have been a lot greater. They thrashed them, really.</p> <p>Whichever way it all plays out, rest assured that the OBO will be here to keep you company. If they do get on, let\u2019s hope for a game half as captivating as yesterday. Given I\u2019m currently writing this sitting on the ground in the Trent Bridge car park (long story; accreditation, urgh!) I\u2019ll just be a few minutes getting my act together and popping upstairs. But don\u2019t delay: <a href=\"mailto:adam.collins.casual@theguardian.com\">drop me a line</a>. <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/collinsadam\">Tweet</a> me. Good morning.<br></p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Vic Marks sets up England v West Indies: I\u2019m getting some more emails coming in, but can I really keep going after the brilliance below? I feel like this is the natural place to let this lovely rain-soaked day come to rest. Inspection: the dream within the dream. Here\u2019s the Guardian interactive World Cup standings, on your way out. Thanks everyone for all your correspondence over the day. The rainy OBO is often perversely the nicest OBO, because we get to spend a bit of time together rather than manically update the scores. That said, let\u2019s hope we get some cricket next time. England v West Indies at the Rose Bowl tomorrow, and remembering what they did to each other in the Caribbean a couple of months ago, that match couldn\u2019t be any bigger. And I\u2019ve got to give points for competing to Brendan Large, who also gets points for having a name like a British sketch comedy character. Now this is a bold new foray into Erasmus Land. One of the lesser-known Faraway Tree destinations. Neeraj just casually knocking it out in five minutes. Star. Oooooh. Sharad has really upped the game with this alternate poster use. Oh yes. This is exactly what was called for. Aditya is first cab off the rank. To go back to Jack\u2019s question from earlier, this abandonment isn\u2019t really worth anything to the Kiwis at all. It gets them one point, which can be handy for teams that need a tie-breaker to qualify for a semi-final. But New Zealand already have a vastly better net run rate than anyone in the tournament, so if they do end up level on points then it\u2019s a win for the Land of the Long White Cloud. As for India, they miss out on a chance to go three from three, and slot in right behind En Zed at the head of the table. For now the Indians have five points, sitting third behind Australian and ahead of England. It\u2019s a handy point for them, but they would have backed themselves to beat New Zealand, and they would have enjoyed the workout against another strong team after knocking off the Aussies in London last weekend. As for the rest of us, we\u2019ve been deprived of a truly tasty match-up between New Zealand\u2019s excellent pace attack and India\u2019s powerful batting. Ferguson, Henry, Boult slinging the ball down at Rohit, Kohli, Dhoni... a damn shame. Not to mention Ross Taylor\u2019s red-hot form against Jasprit Bumrah and Bhuvi Kumar. The pitch would have been zippy for fast bowlers, and the cloud cover might have introduced another element. But no good. We may not see these two teams play at all in this World Cup, unless they meet again in the finals. A crying shame. Enough rain now, everyone. Let\u2019s just agree this has come far enough. David Malcom emails in some classic journo war stories. \u201cI go way back to the days of uncovered wickets. All the old guys used to talk about how it produced exciting cricket. But it also meant hanging around for hours waiting for the pitch to dry out. I remember covering as a young reporter Northants v the New Zealand tourists in the early 1970s when it was a lovely sunny day from early morning and there was no play until 3pm because of fussy umpires. Gave me time for a good interview with Richard Hadlee but really pissed off spectators. \u201cThe grounds have improved greatly since then with modern drainage but the past week has again shown there is no way of guarding against terrible weather. A long tournament like this was always going to be at risk of descending into a soggy anticlimax. I have memories of freezing in press boxes at early season county matches and watching the downpours. The UK just does not have the weather for a game which is so sensitive to rain. Pity it never took on in Spain.\u201d Well, in Spanish-speaking countries at least, I can tell you that Cricket Mexico is doing some very good work. Here\u2019s one of the people making it happen, Craig White. The inevitable announcement comes through, and the match has been abandoned. New Zealand and India will share points. Jack Jorgensen is an Australian living in southwest England, and writes in with some sensible meteorology. \u201cThe average rainfall figures are misleading. You want to consider average days of rain &gt; 1mm. This is more useful as Australian rain in March is likely more intense, leading to less time actually raining. By my reckoning Sydney has 9.9 such days in March on average, and London 7.4. So whilst London has half as much average rainfall in volume, it\u2019s likely spread out across more days, and hence the chance of rain affecting the play is not all that different. PS: thoughts on how happy this washout might make the Kiwis?\u201d Quite so. But if the chance of rain is not all that different, it still derails the rather silly argument that we shouldn\u2019t play cricket in England, the place where it was invented, in June, the month where more of it has been played than any other. And a couple more ticket price emails, which have some very useful detail. Thanks everyone. Starting with Andrew Cosgrove. \u201cPrices for tickets were in line with perceived demand, so the most expensive matches were those involving England, India and Pakistan. On the other hand, I don\u2019t think Ind vs Pak was any more expensive than Eng vs Anyone. There were about four bands of prices, with the lower one being cheap - tickets for \u00a318 were available, mostly for games involving Afghanistan or Bangladesh. It doesn\u2019t seem that unreasonable. India vs Pakistan was the most oversubscribed sporting event in this country since the 2012 Olympics, making the tickets cheaper just would have made it carnage.\u201d I can understand that logic, but the unfortunate corollary is that it reduces demand by financial clout. So basically it\u2019s a sporting body saying it will alleviate the pressure by limiting access to wealthier people. Not exactly an unprecedented strategy in our society, but not one that survives ethical scrutiny for me. Ishfaq Razzak, meanwhile, writes that \u201cit\u2019s been really difficult to get tickets through the ballot but I get it, everyone wants tickets and it\u2019s a fair way of doing it. I managed to get tickets to the Pakistan v Sri Lanka match (rained off) at \u00a320 but the Pakistan v India match was close to a hundred! Pakistan v India is the hottest ticket around, I\u2019ve seen offers at \u00a3800 (that\u2019s cheap) to \u00a31700 for Gold tickets. \u201cIt looks like the punters that have bought extra tickets are selling for at least double, I bought Pakistan v NZ at \u00a340 ea whereas face value is \u00a320. It\u2019s been 20 years since the last World Cup here so I guess there\u2019s no other way to buy tickets from friends / touts if you don\u2019t get selected. I paid \u00a395 (face value) to a friend who managed to get Pakistan v Bangladesh at Lord\u2019s on 5th July. Warner stand, terrace, front row, Gold tickets. Seems like an okay price when compared to football ticket prices. Friend is selling the remaining two tickets at \u00a3150 each and he\u2019s getting lots of interest. See you at Lord\u2019s.\u201d Indeed. I don\u2019t want to know what tickets to the final will cost, especially if a couple of teams in light blue make the cut. And that umpire inspection has led to an announcement of another umpire inspection, at 3pm. Layers within layers. Wait, wasn\u2019t Inspection that movie with di Caprio and Joseph Gordon Levitt? Can someone photoshop the poster for me in the next few minutes? Some ticket correspondence. It\u2019s time for another exciting episode of Umpire Walk, the show where umpires wander about and poke the ground with umbrellas. It\u2019s all rather Lady Bracknell, prodding something with your brolly tip to see if it\u2019s working or express your displeasure. Now they\u2019re meeting with a delegation of ground staff to discuss the terms of their surrender. We\u2019ve shifted narratives, now Tyrion Lannister may be involved. In other cricketing news, England\u2019s women are taking on the West Indies down at Chelmsford. So there\u2019s no rain (at the moment) out Essex way. Tammy Beaumont and Amy Jones are off to a good start, they\u2019re 40 without loss in the 10th over. But it looks like it might rain there soon, too. Beaumont has made 61 and 32 so far in this series, and Jones 18 and 91. So they\u2019ll both be keen to stay out there as long as possible. \u201cWelcome Geoff,\u201d writes Sreekanth Nandakumar, who is very kind to do so. \u201cAm I the only Indian fan who hope the India-Pakistan match is abandoned due to rain ? The ICC has been charging exorbitant prices for all the India matches, especially the Pakistan one. If it is abandoned, they will be at least three quarters out of pocket which will give me absolute happiness. The UK government have even increased the visa price to the UK from Europe to around 230 Euros from 100 Euros two years back, which is insane. It is only around 20 euros to fly from Brussels/Cologne to London. Normal fans have been abandoned and I see that the rain gods are not happy with that.\u201d This is an interesting point. I didn\u2019t realise that the ticket prices had spiked for specific games at this tournament. If anyone else has experience of this, let me know about it. What have you paid for tickets, officially? How did it vary by match? What have you paid for tickets from scalpers / touts? Drop me an email or a tweet. For context on rainy venues, here are Ric Finlay\u2019s numbers referring to Australia\u2019s most recent World Cup. \u201cAfternoon Geoff,\u201d writes Simon McMahon. \u201cIn the absence of any actual cricket, I\u2019m getting my summer reading list in order, and so have just ordered a copy of \u2018Steve Smith\u2019s Men\u2019, written coincidentally by someone with the same name as your good self. Any idea if it\u2019s any good?\u201d Simon, all I can tell say is that the man in a charlatan of the highest order. I don\u2019t know him but I don\u2019t trust him. I certainly don\u2019t trust a word he wrote. Also I believe that e-book sales give him a better royalty than paper copies, but also that giving physical books as gifts is a fine way to express love or friendship. What has particularly interested me over the last week or so is how angry some people are at the fact that it\u2019s raining. Lots of comments about how this is all the ICC\u2019s fault or England\u2019s fault or someone\u2019s fault, and that the World Cup should never have been staged here, or should have been at a different time of year, or something. The interesting part is that every cricket country has rain, and washouts, and abandonments. I seem to recall sitting through a lot of rained out Tests over Boxing Day and the New Year\u2019s week in Melbourne and Sydney. A lot of two-session days in Sri Lanka. The 2016 World T20 in India, where they played that blockbuster against Pakistan at what felt like midnight after delaying and delaying a rain-affected start in Kolkata. That was after a decision a week or so earlier to move the match from Dharamsala, where I was stationed, and where I can attest that we saw more than our share of Himalayan rain, deluges, and a massive hailstorm that blocked the roads in and out of town for a night. So, yes. Rain. It happens. Sometimes more and sometimes less than others. Maybe English grounds could look at covering their whole outfields though, so we could have got some play during the reprieves on a day like this. The rain seems to have stopped, incidentally. But even if we had full ground covers today, I can\u2019t see that we could have got more than about 20 overs in so far. It\u2019s testament to the hardy types that cricket attracts that there are any people still at the ground. Surely this is going to be a washout. The umpires had two hour-long delays to try to give the ground time to dry while it wasn\u2019t raining. Now it\u2019s raining all over that ground again. And yet the stands are a good portion full of optimistic souls in outdoor wear, wandering about with hoods up, chatting and eating their snacks and listening to a playlist that has obviously been lifted from a mid-popularity fast fashion store. Bless your dreams, all of you. Hello all. Today, we are all Virat Kohli in a beanie, leaning out of a window looking sad and cold. Who would want Virat to be sad? Monsters. But one cannot reason with weather. We drove up from Taunton to Nottingham last night through hours of teeming motorway rain, a real Douglas Adams sequence of different types of downpour. And here we are, with Type 72 (misting persistent drizzle that makes you much wetter than it has any right to by volume) causing a mushrooming of umbrellas all through the stands. And that, my friends, is me done. Thank you for making the last five hours fly by with your emails. Sure, we haven\u2019t seen a ball bowled. And yes, we\u2019re all very frustrated. But I hope we\u2019ve learned a thing or two about drones along the way. What more could one want? For the next stint, I wish Geoff Lemon, to my right, good health and dry weather. Talk to you all again over the weekend. Bye! \u201cA genuine query,\u201d in from Avitaj Mitra. \u201cWith the washouts so far (and the potential for more in future), I\u2019d say it\u2019s not beyond the realms of impossibility to assume that two teams might end up with identical records. (Even the NRR might be same). Say this is the case for the 4th spot. Which team progresses in that case? (Before you say head to head result, what if the match between those two teams was also washed out?) A pretty little dilemma for the ICC, eh?\u201d If my decade in politics taught me one thing, whenever you go through a process like this, eventually, at some stage, you end up drawing lots. This might be that. Alternatively. \u201cWhy not get all the teams together and play a game of musical chairs?\u201d asks Uma Venkatraman. \u201cLast four standing are the semi-finalists. Between now and July 14, there will be enough reserve days for two matches and the final.\u201d John Little rounding us out for the time being with a bit of Old Fashioned Commonsense. \u201cCan\u2019t they just have reserve days starting now? It\u2019s not bloody village cricket and they have a wedding to go to tomorrow or work on monday. How hard can it be to arrange a cricket match when even the ICC can manage it?\u201d Harder than it sounds, according to the ICC\u2019s statement on Monday in relation to this topic. These are massive events. But if they had their time again... This is a pretty cool radar type thing. Thanks to John Morrissey, who emailed it through earlier. It reads: \u201cLight rain stopping in 20 min., starting again 25 min. later.\u201d Rinse and repeat. Some pot pouri, shall we. \u201cBy the time England and Wales\u2019s turn comes around again for the CWC,\u201d begins John Starnuck, \u201cmeteorologists might have got even better at long-term forecasts. Not that this would necessarily be taken into account; after all, who would schedule a tour of Sri Lanka during the monsoon season? Oh. Still, built-in reserve days, plus possible extensions to a day\u2019s play to 10pm would still be worth it.\u201d I\u2019m a little bit worried what this will do to England\u2019s reputation. Talking to several senior World Cup officials a few weeks before the tournament, I asked them all the same question: what keeps you up at 2am? They all said rain. \u201cTalking of great songs,\u201d wrote Abhijato Sensarma a while back. \u201cSurely one wouldn\u2019t mind if I nominate \u2018Stand By\u2019? I wasn\u2019t that impressed by it at first, since it wasn\u2019t exactly World Cup-esque, but those thoughts have been long abandoned... LORYN and Rudimental have composed an absolute BANGER for the ages!\u201d I\u2019m with you. They have nailed it with the song. On what happens if rain hits later in the comp, Andrew Gladwin has the skinny, and it is as we assumed. \u201cIf both days of the semi-finals are rained off, then higher place in the round-robin table goes through \u2013and if final rained-off, trophy shared,\u201d he says. \u201cBut surely the ICC should now be looking at creative ways to settle rained-out knock-out matched in the highly likely event that it happens \u2013how about a dance-off with the Strictly Come Dancing judges?\u201d I DECLARE A THUMB WAR! \u201cSurely this is the kind of game where both sides would probably take the rain off,\u201d suggests Kevin Wilson. \u201cHelps then both with qualification seeing as they\u2019re both likely to make the SFs.\u201d At this stage, I\u2019m sure that will be the chat in the dressing room. It is still raining, although not as heavily as it was 10 minutes ago when it was sheeting down. Semi-heavily. Actually, upgrade that to quite heavily. We aren\u2019t far away from Geoff Lemon taking the baton at Trent Bridge, would you believe. I\u2019ll get through as many emails as I can before that special ceremony takes place. \u201cThanks for your perseverance!\u201d Thanks for being part of it, William Stenhouse. \u201cI just saw that the women\u2019s one day is at The CloudFM County Ground, so that seems apt. Still, you can multitask and OBO both of them.\u201d Like playing two pianos, it can be done but I wouldn\u2019t advise it. Whenver I think of the CloudFM, I wonder whether one day we can get the HatFM County Ground. Check out The Spin podcast! Subscribe in all the usual places with the excellent Emma John and her rotating panel of pundits. I\u2019m on next week, from memory. I said that we were moving on from roof chat, and we are. But I can\u2019t resist this from Tom Carver. \u201cTor Turner is on the right track but not quite there. What they need is a stadium sized one of these. Apparently Harrow school in Beijing has one over its sports fields (to keep the air pollution out), so they must come in fairly large sizes.\u201d Hold on. You\u2019re telling me the answer might be... a BIODOME?! Pauly Shore, at last it is your time to shine again. The big covers are off again. Yep. You better believe it. A lot of angry emails about rain and England and so on. Evidently last year was the outlier and it is normally very wet in June here. I suppose they could have played this in August and the Ashes in June? Alternatively, they might ban England from hosting it in 20 years from now when it is next their turn. Given broadcasters are now likely to miss an Indian fixture, you couldn\u2019t rule that out. \u201cFollowing the Guarding OBO for quite some time now, have to say its really entertaining especially when the weather is like this.\u201d Thanks, Kshitij Sikawar in Delhi. We\u2019re giving it our best. \u201cWe want reserve days!\u201d There were reserve days in 1999, of course. Indeed, it allowed England vs India to continue on a second day, the hosts eliminated after collapsing. Had the game been washed out, they would have progressed to the Super Six. It was Zimbabwe\u2019s mighty win (Neil Johnson\u2019s masterpiece) over South Africa in Chelmsford, as rain fell in Birmingham, which set up that crazy final day in the groups. Check it out. A good time to return to drones and tarps, then. Ian Forth is with me but doesn\u2019t want to \u201center the Beefy phase of my life and grumble to anyone who\u2019ll listen.\u201d Lucky, then, that we have solutions. Tor Turner has just travelled from Manchester to London and \u201ccan confirm it was raining every place the train passed through,\u201d which is far from ideal. It\u2019s given him time to think, though. \u201cIn terms of roofs, inflatable ones would be the way to go. I know it sounds weird but stay with me.\u201d Oh, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m with you. \u201cThis company reckons it could be manufactured off site and installed in a single night. I\u2019d like to see them manage that for a stadium mind.\u201d Be right back, off to throw my wallet at them for all the shares they\u2019ll give me. Elbert Matt Loubser is also into my inbox on the topic, from South Africa. He\u2019s not keen. \u201cI am an engineer, but not of the structural persuasion. Greatest challenges with implementing a temporary roof are matters such as the mechanics required for relatively quick setup or breakdown (rain cover times 20), man-power wouldn\u2019t cut it and the machines required would have to be integrated with the structure of the stadium (including lighting). Cost and inconvenience would lead architects to rather install a permanent roof. But indoor cricket is another matter; how high would the roof have to be? Will grass-care be assured? What will the white-clad Test Match officials have to say about this sudden change? It\u2019s just not on.\u201d Drones, though. Drones with tarps. With gutters that manage the flow. Et voila! Last but not least for now, M. B. Anand with his first ever email to the OBO! Welcome to the club. Make sure it is not your last. \u201cVery interesting ideas - holding up a tarp with drones or balloons,\u201d he begins. \u201cSome quick calculations below to check feasibility: 1) Drones - Problem is power. Considering most stay aloft for about half hour and the very best, costing around $7500, can last no more than a couple of hours before needing re-juicing, this is likely to be a problem. Of course, we could arrange a complicated \u201cchange of guard\u201d as drones rotate in and out constantly.... 2) Hot air balloon - Representative heavy duty tarp weight = 18 oz. per square yard With a ground, say a circle of about 80m, the tarp weight is about 12183 kg. Given that a cubic foot of air lofts about 7 g of weight, this translates to a large spherical balloon of about 150 ft. in diameter. About a third of the size of the ground. Or many smaller ones that add up to the same volume. That seems quite feasible. Balloon wins, I think. Let\u2019s do this!\u201d This started with a shadecloth in space and has morphed into a hot air balloon. I\u2019m proud of the progression. But I think, for now, I\u2019m going to move this conversation on. Thanks for the many, many emails on it. It\u2019s been fun. Of course it is. Within five minutes of the inspection announcement, all the covers are on again. This is the heaviest it has been since 10:15am, I\u2019m afraid. I\u2019m not even going to say it this time. And guess what: it\u2019s dark again, too. I must say, your emails today are outstanding. There are a lot of them, so please don\u2019t be angry with me if they don\u2019t all get the attention they deserve. \u201cAny mathematicians out there?\u201d asks Ian Forth. \u201cIs a compressed game likely to have a disproportionate effect on a net run rate?\u201d \u201cSo you are telling me there is not one ICC authority member that figured out that a World Cup in England could have some serious rain affected matches? yells Hugo. \u201cReally poor planning on their behalf accoring to me.\u201d I can\u2019t sign up to that one. There was 2mm of rain here last June. It sucks but it happens. Check out the days rained out during Sydney Tests over the years. But the broader point about planning, well, back to my giant umbrella bit shortly. \u201cIt\u2019s now 5am in Edmonton in Western Canada and the games start at 3.30 am and we are anxiously huddled around the TV, but this totally sucks!!!\u201d adds Mike Weerasooriya. Thanks for sticking it out. I really hope this happens today. The crowd outside this morning were just brilliant. Three hours should do the trick. More grounds that rock your world that aren\u2019t talked about so often. Garry Sharp loves Adelaiade for the nocturnal reasons - don\u2019t we all. Great night out, especially since they liberalised their laneways. He\u2019s also fond of Sophia Gardens. \u201cJust the perfect sized stadium. And that Welsh warmth.\u201d Also the scene of Shane Watson\u2019s final Test Match, let\u2019s not forget. The place was heaving that day. Back in the middle, all the big covers are off and only the hovercraft is left. More importantly: the darkest clouds seem to have lifted. It\u2019s still overcast but no longer deathly. No formal word quite yet on when the inspection will be, however. \u201cHardly an original sentiment I imagine, but a washout here is no bad thing for we Kiwis (collective noun: \u2018we-ki-wis\u2019),\u201d writes Ben Bernards. \u201cA shared point against India clearly helps the Quest For The Final 4. Worst-case scenario is the sunshine coming out at 3pm, and being defeated in a resultant 20-over slap-a-thon.\u201d For those interested in these things, in order to get a T20 played before time runs out, they need to spark up the first ball by 4:20pm. At least this was the time we were given last Friday when there was the Bristol washout. I\u2019m hopeful again. On that same theme, from Andrew Cosgrove. \u201cI haven\u2019t been to too many grounds, but I\u2019d agree with you that the Basin is my favourite. And obvious. Aside from that, I love that Sophia Gardens is slap-bang in the middle of the city, and just a short walk along the River Taff from the railway station (and it\u2019s a lovely walk). Hagley Oval is less convenient, but a great place to watch cricket; it feels like you\u2019re watching a Test match on your local park.\u201d Yes and yes. Cardiff because they sing Bread of Heaven over and over, which really gets me fired up and wishing I tapped more into my Welsh family history. Hagley Oval for the reasons you state. Geoff and I were there in January 2016 when Brendon McCullum smashed his 54-ball ton, to break the record in his final Test Match. I was on radio commentary for 20 minutes when he moved from 40 to 82. He made the next 18 runs in the next five balls. Special city. Love Christchurch. A nice note from Eoin in Dublin on an earlier topic. \u201cAlways love the OBO, especially when it\u2019s raining...saves me from having to do some work. On the subject of favourite cricket grounds, there are so many beautiful ones around the world. Adelaide, Basin Reserve, Newlands, Eden Gardens etc. The Himachal Pradesh ground at Dharamasala is spectacular, but for all that, my favourite ground I\u2019ve ever been to is the old Rec in Antigua. Full of noise and colour as you sat there in the sun with a gentle breeze, drinking a beer, looking out over the Caribbean and watching the Windies play a test match. Such a shame it\u2019s gone. What a way to spend a few days.\u201d Great nomination. Both times I\u2019ve toured Antigua have led to me spending hours there in repeat visits. Last November, this brought a lovely moment. Out the back, they still have the food stalls and so on. I pulled up at one to grab some lunch at the front bench. A couple of bites in I look up and who is sitting next to me but Sir Curtly Ambrose. \u201cHe always drops in when home,\u201d the boss told me after he left. I feel like we\u2019re being gaslit by the covers. Which, sure enough, after coming off again. Just the big ones. Can\u2019t wait to tell you in about 20 minutes that there is going to be an inspection at 1:30pm. Mark my words. Back to my idea, [Ted Hastings] now we\u2019re cooking with gas [/Ted Hastings]. Ben Finn to open the batting, from the many emails I\u2019ll try and get through on the topic. \u201cHere is my suggestion: in the event of washout-threateningly dreadful weather forecasts such as today, there could be an army of drones, tethered to the stadium, attached to some kind enormous tarpaulin. Arranged in a circle with one in the middle that would fly highest to allow runoff, these drones take flight and hoist the tarp above the entire ground. This could play havoc withlateral movement of the ball, so once in place, the roof would have to remain for the duration of the match, much like on Centre Court. What could possibly go wrong (provided the ground is not near an airport)? Thank you for your entertaining World Cup coverage in all conditions!\u201d BEN! What a start! Cop that! Broadly in line with this, my Airbnb host this morning suggested that the military now has the ability to use thermal technology to shift where rain falls. Was she having me on? I feel like maybe she was having me on. \u201cAn engineer or ideas person, you say?\u201d adds Joby Allen. This is promosing. \u201cMyself (engineer) and my mate Barry (ideas) were discussing this very matter whilst sat in the rain at the Ageas Bowl on Monday. Our conclusion was a giant tarp held up by drones (engineer) or miniature hot air balloons (ideas).\u201d Drones! I never even thought of this but now it\u2019s all so obvious. So clear. I\u2019m writing you a proper reply. Let\u2019s invent something brilliantly bonkers. \u201cMorning Adam.\u201d Brian Withington, always a pleasure. \u201cI was intrigued to read about your motor home journey from Taunton to Nottingham last night. I have visions of you pluckily criss-crossing the country and \u2018freedom parking\u2019 in side roads by the grounds, eking out your frugal Guardian daily allowance with a bag of chips and reading a well worn Wisden by street light.\u201d It\u2019s actually the bus of two colleagues doing pretty much as you suggest, Gav Joshi and Bharat Sundaresan, two of the very best people in all the cricket world. \u201cOr is it more like the epic VW Camper Van questing journey to and around Pakistan from Duckworth-Lewis Method\u2019s \u2018Meeting Mr Miandad\u2019? Speaking of which, the great man turned 62 years old yesterday (not many people know that - and I was shocked that he\u2019s older than me). Where (whither?) are you next hitching your wagon?\u201d We\u2019re finished for now; \u2018twas a one-night-only affair. But this is their #wconwheels from today, featuring Geoff and me at 1:30am looking as bad as we sounded after a day that included radio commentary, writing, video, podding and meal deals. \u201cJust reading your blog and notice you are recommending the Trent Bridge Inn to hunker down in while rain ruins play,\u201d Chris Slade begins, with a reference to coffee in the subject line, which I\u2019m looking forward to. \u201cIf it\u2019s a little too early for some of your readers to be on the sauce then I can highly recommend the excellent coffee served by Okende in West Bridgford. It\u2019s a great little speciality coffee shop that has recently opened up and is run by two young entrepreneurs.\u201d Consider it recommended. I\u2019m going to send Ben Jones out to grab me a flattie. Stuart Eaton has a suggestion as well. \u201cIn situations like this with the rain coming and going, why can the teams not just get the toss done indoors somewhere? Will save time and also warranting a pitch inspection for a coin throw.\u201d There is probably a logical reason for this to do with the ability for the captain to change their XI until the final moment in relation to the surface, but yes, this does seem a sensible way to save some valuable time on a day like today. I\u2019m just picturing Virat Kohli holding the trophy up with, oh, I dunno, Mashrafe Mortaza. One arm each, on the balcony at Lord\u2019s. And the world will live as one. Out come the big covers. You couldn\u2019t make this up because WHY WOULD YOU? YOU WOULDN\u2019T. There are only about six umbrellas up. Maybe ten. It can\u2019t be more than a spinkle. But, once again, it\u2019s enough to halt the process. \u201cI am Jeremy Flint enjoying your coverage in sunny and warm Manila.\u201d Hello Jeremy. Don\u2019t rub it in, man. \u201cPerhaps you could share on the feed what would happen if both the scheduled day and the reserve day are washed out during the knockout stage. It does not seem an unlikely outcome does it?\u201d Taking a quick sample of those sitting near me, we agree that it must be points in the group stage. I\u2019ll check this out when I see somebody wearing an ICC uniform. \u201cDo you know what happens if the Reserve Day of the Final is washed out?\u201d CricViz\u2019s Ben Jones asks from the seat next to me. \u201cThey share the trophy.\u201d What a circus that would be. I almost want it to happen for the yaaaarn. James Coyne from The Cricketer has a better idea: \u201cA bowl off in the indoor school!\u201d You know the drill by now. Just as it was at 10:30am and 11:30am: if there is no more rain, there will be an inspection at 12:30pm. Cue the rain then, right? \u201cThanks for the OBO and to you and Geoff for the daily pod,\u201d begins Tanya Wintringham. \u201cYou guys must be wired/knackered.\u201d Something like that. We hitched a ride in a motor home last night. And thank you; we\u2019re having a great time. Geoff will be along later for the second innings, provided we get that far. \u201cWith any luck Lockie will take 5 for 32, with back up from Trent who hasn\u2019t had a lot of luck/success in the last couple. Hopefully we will have learned to coordinate our outfield catching since the last game. We can then go on to find some proper batting form outside the Taylor/Williamson run out collective.\u201d I\u2019m very keen to interview Lockie Ferguson before the end of the tournament. I need to know the backstory behind the fan (family member? girlfriend?) who was dancing around in his official CWC19 jumper when making the winning runs against Bangladesh. I have an unhealthy obsession with cricket jumpers, which helps explain my delight in this photo wearing Zimbabwe\u2019s from 1992. I\u2019m not sure if I should even tell you this and raise hopes... but in the interests of transparency, the big covers are off once more. Don\u2019t take this as a sign of anything while it is so dark and unleasant. Let\u2019s do the pitch inspection dance again. \u201cWork,\u201d emails Ryan Bennett-Barlow. \u201cAbsolute belter of a song.\u201d Too right. I saw Charlotte play last year and she\u2019s the everything. \u201cA rather optimistic New Zealander hoping it clears up to continue the run of silky cricket our boys have been playing; if it doesn\u2019t at least I now have an absolutely wonderful tune from Charlotte Day Wilson in my head for the rest of the day.\u201d Now I\u2019m smiling. Calling all gamers. Cricket 19 is here. I had a brief look at it during the England kit launch before this World Cup. In that mock-up, Glenn Maxwell was batting at Lord\u2019s in a Test. I conclude that this is clearly a game conceived in my dreams. I\u2019m after an engineer. During the week, I\u2019ve been arguing on our daily WC pod that there must be a way to erect some sort of temporary tarp over a cricket ground. I\u2019m not saying that this is an easy fix but is it not worth having a conversation about? This is what Chris Meister is referring to below. Maybe what I\u2019m after is an Ideas Person rather than an engineer. Both, ideally. If you\u2019re it, email me. It\u2019s not a pretty view at Trent Bridge today. Brollies remain up, every cover in place. Nothing torrential but just enough to frustrate any hope of, well, anything. Although, as Rohit Singh notes, \u201cit is possible if you really try\u201d to play in the wet. \u201cGood to meet you today morning Adam!\u201d writes member of the OBO fam, Gaurav Jindal. It just happened to be that we met at breakfast at the AirBnb we were both staying at, Gaurav having made the trip from Mumbai to watch the Men in Blue. He also sent me the photo he took of us together, which serves as a fairly abrupt reminder that I\u2019m not 25 anymore. Not at 7am after four hours of kip, anyway. \u201cWhy did the infernally infuriating Steve Waugh refer to Hardik Pandya as the next Lance Klusener?\u201d ponders Amod Paranjape. \u201cI hold you responsible for this.\u201d Speaking of Lance, we have him on the 1999 World Cup pod next week and it\u2019s fair to say he still plays all his shots. The next ep is with Andy Flower on Zimbabwe and might be the best interview we\u2019ve ever done across two series. Great man. Remember what I said an hour ago about there being an inspection if no further rain at 10:30am? We just had the very same message from the ICC for 11:30am. The problem, from my vantage point, is that it\u2019s now very gloomy overhead. Oh, and as I was about to hit send the big covers are coming on again with umbrellas up and all the rest. Yep, the rain is back. Not heavy, but enough. \u201cConsole yourself with the fact that there\u2019s a rare AFL Thursday morning game on,\u201d writes my best Eurovision friend (he has other traits too), Matthew Woolston. \u201cAFL straight into a India vs NZ T20 smash-up. The dream.\u201d Speaking of 2017, it\u2019s a replay of that year\u2019s Grand Final: Adelaide vs Richmond. The cricket link is that they\u2019re playing at Adelaide Oval, which was repurposed as an AFL ground about five years ago. My favourite of all the cricket grounds. Bit boring and reflexive of me to say that though, isn\u2019t it? Same with where I am today, Trent Bridge. Or Basin Reserve in Wellington. All magnificent but always the answer when citing the best places to watch the international game. Where else? What ground have you been to which rocked your world? And why? For me, it\u2019s Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Dhaka. I had the good fortune to cover the Test there when Bangladesh knocked off Australia two years ago. Every Australian in attendance was moved by the response from the remarkable crowd, including emotional Bangladesh PM on the field at the end. I\u2019m not going to get carried away... but the the covers on the square are being removed. That was a nasty little storm half an hour ago, so we\u2019ve got some waiting to do yet. Then again, I just received a text from former Blackcap Simon Doull, who is on TV comms today and would have good intel. He\u2019s not optimistic. But we\u2019ll plough on in any case. Need some cheering up? We had Matthew Engel with us at Taunton yesterday and it was lovely to see him. He punched out 800 of the best at stumps about Somerset then and now, which I strongly recommend. The county championship rolls on. Tanya Aldred\u2019s blog is a must. \u201cOnly one thing to do now,\u201d suggests Gurminder Chera. \u201cFind a pub and set up camp.\u201d I had a similarly-themed email from John Starbuck, recommending the Trent Bridge Inn. It\u2019s a pub I know well. Not on this tour, though. I worked out yesterday that I\u2019ve had five pints since opening day. Five. I\u2019m no boozehound (promise), but I can\u2019t remember the last 15-day stretch where I\u2019ve been so anti-social. I feel this is enough of a link to pop in my favourite song of 2017. The heavy rain has stopped. But it continues to spit. All the covers remain firmly on, though, which suggests the ground staff are expecting more to hit soon. Sigh. \u201cDo you really think that\u2019s Kane Williamson in the commercial?\u201d I\u2019m just the copy/paste guy with that. But yes, I\u2019m sure David wouldn\u2019t mind me correcting the record that the Blackcap in the advert is, indeed, Grant Elliott - not Kane. They should name one of the second-tier domestic T20 comps after GE one day. I\u2019m sorry to report. Truly sorry. \u201cOver here in NZ with the Kiwis,\u201d begins David Perkins. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty level headed about the whole thing. But worst aspect (worse even than naming approach for all their sports teams) is one of the banks trying to drum up local fan support as the pyjarmy army. The advert featuring Kane W is as bad as you would imagine.\u201d Let\u2019s dig it out, shall we? Good grief. Make it stop. Then again, I want those New Zealand PJs real bad. \u201cThis World Cup is spoiled by rain gods and you have been splendid in its apt coverage,\u201d gushes Mahendra Killedar. I\u2019ll gush back on behalf of all of us: why, thank you. The OBO is a joy when operating every day through a major tournament, rain or otherwise. \u201cWhilst we are at it, how about renaming this blog to DBD? Drop By Drop!\u201d If this keeps up, we might have to. But I\u2019m maintaining the positive energy about today\u2019s prospects. We might here here until 9pm, but I reckon we\u2019re getting on. Official update from the ICC in the press box: \u201cif there is no further rain, the umpires will inspect the pitch at 10:30am.\u201d As we received that news there was a roar around Trent Bridge from the Indian faithful as the hovercraft was removed. It reveals a nice, fresh pitch. Delicious. \u201cAre you allowed to comment on the ICC\u2019s disgraceful slapping down of Michael Holding?\u201d asks Gary Naylor on the tweet. (In fact, that\u2019s one of those questions that requires no answer - its mere stating is enough to tell us all we need to know). A terrible time for that story to drop after two days had been rained out, becoming the talk of the tournament. I mostly loved Mikey\u2019s line about whether he should simply go home rather than heading to the next game. It reminded me of an answer Ian Chappell gave Geoff and me when interviewing him recently, in relation to the time he was told what he could/couldn\u2019t say on air by the BCCI. Okay, I\u2019m upstairs in my seat. That\u2019s a start. It\u2019s also a start that the main covers have been removed across the square. The hovercraft is still siting over the main strip, but we\u2019re heading in the right direction. The toss is scheduled for 10am local time, which seems destined to be delayed. We\u2019ll see shortly. Will there be cricket? When I arrived here last night in the motor home that took me from Taunton to Nottingham, we didn\u2019t think so. It was torrential. It was biblical. It was not fit for the sport we love. However, despite mizzle and drizzle and all the rest over the last couple of hours, it hasn\u2019t poured. There\u2019s a gentle breeze running across Trent Bridge. We\u2019re a chance. Probably not at the scheduled starting time of 10:30am, but provided this break of sorts in the weather continues, I think we\u2019re a big hope of getting on. At a modern ground like Trent Bridge, perhaps sooner than might be the case if we were at a non-Test venue. With expectations so cruelly built up like that, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll bucket down as soon as I hit send. But if we don\u2019t, both teams have a big opportunity to take advantage of the washouts from earlier in the week by claiming two points and remaining undefeated. Whoever does might already have a couple of toes into the final four. In Blackcaps land, they\u2019re fit and firing. Tim Southee - the Lennon to Trent Boult\u2019s McCartney in the swing stakes - is fit and available. They\u2019d be made not to pick both of them on a morning like this. Alongside Lockie Ferguson - the quickest bowler in the World Cup so far - and Matt Henry, that\u2019s quite the quartet. India boast similar selection riches. Well, with the ball at least. They are, however, missing Shikhar Dhawan with a thumb injury for a couple of games, which he acquired when stroking a gorgeous ton against Australia on Sunday. The margin of victory there (36 runs) should have been a lot greater. They thrashed them, really. Whichever way it all plays out, rest assured that the OBO will be here to keep you company. If they do get on, let\u2019s hope for a game half as captivating as yesterday. Given I\u2019m currently writing this sitting on the ground in the Trent Bridge car park (long story; accreditation, urgh!) I\u2019ll just be a few minutes getting my act together and popping upstairs. But don\u2019t delay: drop me a line. Tweet me. Good morning.",

I am not against vaccinations \u2014 I support children getting vaccinations and I also support families having the right to make educated medical decisions for their children alongside their physicians. My concern with #SB277 is solely regarding medical exemptions. My dearest friends have a child with a medical condition that warrants an exemption from vaccinations, and should this bill pass, it would greatly affect their family\u2019s ability to care for their child in this state. That\u2019s why I spoke to legislators and argued against this bill. Not because I don\u2019t believe in vaccinations, but because I believe in giving doctors and the families they treat the ability to decide what\u2019s best for their patients and the ability to provide that treatment. I encourage everyone to read more on this issue and to learn about the intricacies of #SB277. Thank you to everyone who met with me this week to engage in this important discussion!</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jessicabiel/\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Jessica Biel</a> (@jessicabiel) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2019-06-13T12:32:25+00:00\">Jun 13, 2019 at 5:32am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>Biel added that the reason she had joined the opposition to the bill was \u201csolely regarding medical exemptions\u201d, and that it \u201cwould greatly affect [a friend\u2019s] family\u2019s ability to care for their child in [California]\u201d.</p> <p>According to the Los Angeles Times, officials estimate that about 40% of the 11,500 medical exemptions requested each year would be denied under the bill, which is currently under review.</p> <p>Posting on Instagram, Kennedy had applauded Biel\u2019s efforts, calling her \u201ccourageous\u201d and for her to be applauded for \u201ca busy and productive day\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Jessica Biel denied suggestions she was a supporter of the anti-vaccination movement after spending the day lobbying lawmakers in the US with advocate Robert F Kennedy Jr. After news emerged of her opposition to a vaccine bill which seeks to limit medical exemptions in California and make it more difficult for parents to bypass the rules requiring children to be vaccinated before enrolling in school, Biel wrote on social media: \u201cI am not against vaccinations \u2014 I support children getting vaccinations and I also support families having the right to make educated medical decisions for their children.\u201d Biel added that the reason she had joined the opposition to the bill was \u201csolely regarding medical exemptions\u201d, and that it \u201cwould greatly affect [a friend\u2019s] family\u2019s ability to care for their child in [California]\u201d. According to the Los Angeles Times, officials estimate that about 40% of the 11,500 medical exemptions requested each year would be denied under the bill, which is currently under review. Posting on Instagram, Kennedy had applauded Biel\u2019s efforts, calling her \u201ccourageous\u201d and for her to be applauded for \u201ca busy and productive day\u201d. Kennedy is chairman of Children\u2019s Health Defense, an organisation that explicitly opposes the bill. In another photo, Kennedy and Biel posed with Democratic Assembly member Autumn Burke, with Biel commenting: \u201cGreat meeting with both of you today.\u201d In an interview with the Daily Beast, Kennedy called Biel \u201ca very effective advocate\u201d, as well as \u201cvery strong and very knowledgeable\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has provoked widespread laughter on social media with a typo suggesting he had recently met a VIP marine mammal among a roll call of world leaders. Listing \u201cthe Queen of England (U.K.)\u201d and the leaders of France, Poland and Ireland, Trump wrote on Thursday that he had also spoken to \u201cthe Prince of Whales\u201d. Social media users reacted with delight to the gaffe, posting pictures imagining how such a meeting might have looked. There were pictures of whales looking suitably regal and ready for the pomp and circumstance of a state visit. And marine-themed makeovers for Prince Charles himself. There were a lot of puns: Some of the familiar Trump meme pictures came out with new captions. While others took the opportunity to redesign the iconic Y Ddraig Goch with a fresh new Trumpian look. Nostalgia for the Free Willy movies surfaced. And users with a long history of Twitter could not help but recall how appropriate the gaffe was, given that Twitter\u2019s own original emblem of service failure used to be known as the \u201cfail whale\u201d. During Trump\u2019s state visit to the UK, he met the Prince of Wales on several occasions, including a dinner at Winfield House, the US ambassador\u2019s residence in London, where Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, were the guests of honour. The president was tweeting on Thursday in the context of a recent interview where he appeared to suggest he would not contact law enforcement if he were offered information from a foreign power that might help him in the 2020 US election. As yet, unlike with Russia, there have been no suggestions that marine mammals played any significant role in his 2016 victory.

Yet it is a long-known and notorious tipple, reportedly founded during prohibition when a pair of rum-running brothers were caught in a blizzard and kept a frostbitten toe in whiskey for preservation. The jar \u2013 complete with toe intact \u2013 was then found in 1973 and, for reasons only known to Captain Dick Stevenson, he had a taste. Stevenson then decided to form a Sourtoe Club, where members are initiated once they have drunk a shot of the whiskey and the dead toe has touched their lips.</p> <p>The whiskey has since changed, as have the toes, owing to thefts; in 2013, one man even swallowed the digit on purpose. Griffiths\u2019s toes will reportedly be kept in salt for six weeks before they are served, but British GP Ben Tschobotko cautions against the Sourtoe\u2019s safety. \u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t do it myself,\u201d he says. \u201cI would worry about drinking it because I don\u2019t know what pathogens might come from a severed toe. While it might be basking in alcohol, it is reused by multiple drinkers so sanitary problems could also arise from there.\u201d Tschobotko says you can only be sure of its safety if each toe is tested in a laboratory.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"78d9d5de62c0fab230c08cd6e5ed1b5f6e9fdb3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78d9d5de62c0fab230c08cd6e5ed1b5f6e9fdb3f/793_88_999_1249/800.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Griffiths, taking part in the Yukon Arctic ultra race.

We\u2019re trying to move away from waste in cocktails, such as unnecessary garnishes, so as much as the toe is reused, I\u2019d still put it in the category of a useless garnish. It\u2019s just a tourist trap.\u201d</p> <p>Apparently, <a href=\"https://www.inverse.com/article/33192-sourtoe-cocktail-dawson-city-yukon-salt-alcohol-preservation\" title=\"\">100,000 people</a> have tried the drink at the Downtown Hotel in Dawson City \u2013 including early revellers who not only had to touch the toe to their lips but put the whole appendage in their mouth and then spit it out.

      "bodyText": "Order a gin and tonic at any bar and you will probably be met with a series of choices: which gin, what flavour of infused tonic, what garnish. If you are at the Artesian in London, the four-time world\u2019s best bar, your glass is also likely to come adorned with a floating pillow filled with aromatic smoke, to be pierced as you take your first sip. What you probably shouldn\u2019t expect is a human toe in your drink. The news on Thursday that British endurance athlete Nick Griffiths was sending his frostbitten and amputated toes to the Yukon in Canada to be sipped in a cocktail, the Sourtoe, will turn the stomachs of most. Yet it is a long-known and notorious tipple, reportedly founded during prohibition when a pair of rum-running brothers were caught in a blizzard and kept a frostbitten toe in whiskey for preservation. The jar \u2013 complete with toe intact \u2013 was then found in 1973 and, for reasons only known to Captain Dick Stevenson, he had a taste. Stevenson then decided to form a Sourtoe Club, where members are initiated once they have drunk a shot of the whiskey and the dead toe has touched their lips. The whiskey has since changed, as have the toes, owing to thefts; in 2013, one man even swallowed the digit on purpose. Griffiths\u2019s toes will reportedly be kept in salt for six weeks before they are served, but British GP Ben Tschobotko cautions against the Sourtoe\u2019s safety. \u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t do it myself,\u201d he says. \u201cI would worry about drinking it because I don\u2019t know what pathogens might come from a severed toe. While it might be basking in alcohol, it is reused by multiple drinkers so sanitary problems could also arise from there.\u201d Tschobotko says you can only be sure of its safety if each toe is tested in a laboratory. What about the taste, though? \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine anything worse; it seems almost cannibalistic, touching a dead toe to your lips,\u201d says Michael Boyle, the director of cocktail-makers the Mixology Brothers. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously some kind of challenge \u2013 the drink isn\u2019t important, it\u2019s just about finishing it. We\u2019re trying to move away from waste in cocktails, such as unnecessary garnishes, so as much as the toe is reused, I\u2019d still put it in the category of a useless garnish. It\u2019s just a tourist trap.\u201d Apparently, 100,000 people have tried the drink at the Downtown Hotel in Dawson City \u2013 including early revellers who not only had to touch the toe to their lips but put the whole appendage in their mouth and then spit it out. For Boyle, it is enough to make him teetotal: \u201cThis is the kind of drink that makes people not want to drink again.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>David Thomson<br>\u2018Essential and kind of crazy\u2019</h2> <p>To be mad about the movies, must you be mad? Isn\u2019t sitting in the dark, hooked on light, a little odd? The shrewdest thing to say about Pauline Kael \u2013 beyond recognising that she was essential \u2013 is that she was kind of crazy. Yet determined to seem rational or in control. She would have been 100 this year. That is a fanciful proposition, for she often seemed emotionally closer to 19, which must have been some strain if you realise she was nearly 50 before she stumbled into the authority she required \u2013 being film critic at the New Yorker.</p> <p>Not that she had the whole job. In some perverse judiciousness, the magazine gave Kael half a year and had someone else do the rest. This was absurd, yet cunning, too, for it left Kael seething, as well as hard up. In her best writing there was a marriage \u2013 no, an affair \u2013 between ecstasy and disgust. </p> <p>On her way to the New Yorker she had led the untidy life of a beatnik, opinionated and extreme, in the footsteps of Katharine Hepburn in Bringing Up Baby or Margaret Sullavan in The Shop Around the Corner \u2013 women so coherent and funny it took 10 minutes to sense they may have been unhinged. Kael was the daughter of a poultry farmer in Petaluma. The family moved south to San Francisco and she studied literature and philosophy at the University of California in Berkeley. She wrote plays that didn\u2019t work, had a relationship and a daughter. She started writing programme notes for a movie repertory cinema. But she was 48 by the time of <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1967/10/21/bonnie-and-clyde\" title=\"\">her famous piece on Bonnie and Clyde</a>. </p> <p>The picture was rescued from critical and commercial failure (and its producer Warren Beatty knew it), but Kael was lucky too. By 1967, old Hollywood was breaking apart. Arrogant newcomers were looking to make edgy movies about the actual America. An educated, literary elite was taking over the cinema. Kael was writing in the prime of Martin Scorsese, Bob Rafelson, Francis Ford Coppola, Peter Bogdanovich, William Friedkin, Robert Altman, Brian De Palma, Sam Peckinpah \u2013 not to mention the last days of Luis Bu\u00f1uel, the heyday of Ingmar Bergman and key works from Roman Polanski, Bernardo Bertolucci, Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Stanley Kubrick. From the outrage of Bonnie and Clyde to the cultural disaster of Star Wars, writing about movies was living with sex, music, politics, race, paranoia and drugs like flowers in your hair. You felt important; you could claim to be sane.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t simply that Kael recorded those years as a regular reviewer. Her agitated voice and spurting rhythms were infectious. She was better than some of the film-makers she espoused \u2013 smarter, more giddily romantic and more insistent that they do good work. She ushered in an age of film controversy at dinner parties. She was as competitive as an old lefty, reckless in taking on disciples \u2013 and then telling them what to think. But she wrote like a fallen angel, a slangy, cocksure Satan who guessed God was asleep. She said she saw the movies only once and sometimes she wrote as she watched.</p> <p>That intensity could not last. She took up an offer to go to Hollywood to be a producer. This was a well-intended gesture from Beatty, part of the gamble that hoped a brilliant critic could deliver films (that had happened with the French New Wave). The experiment ended ruefully because Beatty and James Toback, whose Love and Money she tried to organise, were more self-preoccupied than she could fathom. There she was in LA, yet she couldn\u2019t drive.</p> <p>She came home in a sort of disgrace. That wasn\u2019t the worst of it. Movies went off the boil. So many of them didn\u2019t deserve her. After Jaws and Star Wars, the business returned with a restored, juvenile confidence. Movies cheered up because of their kid audience, but a lofty 19-year-old despair had been Kael\u2019s motor \u2013 another sign of existential turmoil. She felt that dismaying shift, long before illness made writing harder.</p> <p>So she was lucky in her timing. But we were lucky, too, those of us who thought our madness didn\u2019t show. Film critics today labour in a gloom and irrelevance Kael could not tolerate.</p> <h2>Peter Bradshaw<br>\u2018She was a heroic, live-ammo critic\u2019</h2> <p>Kael\u2019s legendary <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1967/10/21/bonnie-and-clyde\" title=\"\">essay-review</a> about Bonnie and Clyde was published in 1967 in the New Yorker. For a movie critic to read it now is to experience a mix of emotions: glee, euphoria, fascination, exhilaration and shame that you are not doing anything like as passionate and glorious in your own work.</p> <p>It is one of the greatest pieces of journalism or criticism; perhaps the greatest I have ever read. This is heroic criticism, warrior criticism, live-ammo criticism that boldly intervenes in culture and unapologetically takes on everything: the movie, the movies, the audience, the other critics, history, society, politics, love and death. This isn\u2019t simply a demonstration of reviewing in all its habitual simpering passivity \u2013 that type of criticism which is, paradoxically, entirely uncritical, because it eats up whatever film is put on its plate every week and then obediently raises a thumb up or down or at some angle.</p> <p>This is criticism that doesn\u2019t wait to be asked, Kael\u2019s criticism isn\u2019t happy with the demurely submissive \u201chandmaiden to the arts\u201d tag; she is more like Joan of Arc at the Battle of Orl\u00e9ans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c8531c7c7d4654b4857351b619ed22d4ec1ede93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8531c7c7d4654b4857351b619ed22d4ec1ede93/0_52_3546_2128/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fayr Dunaway and Warren Beatty as Bonnie and Clyde.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fayr Dunaway and Warren Beatty as Bonnie and Clyde.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bonnie and Clyde was the movie about the real-life Depression-era outlaws Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow, played by Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty, written by David Newman and Robert Benton and directed by Arthur Penn. As a reaction to the mealy-mouthed dismissals of the film that had been appearing in print, particularly on the subject of violence, Kael published this colossal counterblast, proclaiming the film\u2019s integrity and its importance as American art. </p> <p>Kael hits her stride right away: confident, easy, muscular, with an edge of severity. She compares Bonnie and Clyde to <a href=\"http://sensesofcinema.com/2008/cteq/you-only-live-once/\" title=\"\">Fritz Lang\u2019s You Only Live Once</a>, Nicholas Ray\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040872/\" title=\"\">They Live By Night</a> and William Wellman\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022286/\" title=\"\">The Public Enemy</a>, contrasting these movies\u2019 rhetorical gestures at moralism and comeuppance and finds in Bonnie and Clyde a realism and anti-hypocrisy in portraying the criminals\u2019 occupational normality of violence and the provocative audacity of its humour.</p> <p>She sees Bonnie and Clyde\u2019s indebtedness to the French New Wave and to Jean-Luc Godard and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, but while her cinephile comrades may have been content to notice this in order to bolster the film\u2019s importance and intellectual respectability, Kael\u2019s response is far more challenging and contrarian. She is suspicious of any Euro-artistry and points out that what the French were infatuated with was the Americans\u2019 simplicity and populist power: Bonnie and Clyde is strong and vital when it is in touch with this wellspring, but weak when it gets too supercilious and cerebral. </p> <p>Perhaps the most brilliant thing in the review is Kael\u2019s fault-finding in the film itself, her fierce engagement with its flaws \u2013 which I think is how she managed to get under the skin of Beatty, who perhaps resented his debt to her and resented her l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 in refusing to bow the knee to his superior status as a creative artist and movie star. She criticises his acting at various stages, although impudently comments that producing the film may have concentrated his mind on its scene-by-scene structure and his place in it.</p> <p>\u201cHis business sense may have improved his timing. The role of Clyde seems to have released something in him.

      "bodyText": "David Thomson \u2018Essential and kind of crazy\u2019 To be mad about the movies, must you be mad? Isn\u2019t sitting in the dark, hooked on light, a little odd? The shrewdest thing to say about Pauline Kael \u2013 beyond recognising that she was essential \u2013 is that she was kind of crazy. Yet determined to seem rational or in control. She would have been 100 this year. That is a fanciful proposition, for she often seemed emotionally closer to 19, which must have been some strain if you realise she was nearly 50 before she stumbled into the authority she required \u2013 being film critic at the New Yorker. Not that she had the whole job. In some perverse judiciousness, the magazine gave Kael half a year and had someone else do the rest. This was absurd, yet cunning, too, for it left Kael seething, as well as hard up. In her best writing there was a marriage \u2013 no, an affair \u2013 between ecstasy and disgust. On her way to the New Yorker she had led the untidy life of a beatnik, opinionated and extreme, in the footsteps of Katharine Hepburn in Bringing Up Baby or Margaret Sullavan in The Shop Around the Corner \u2013 women so coherent and funny it took 10 minutes to sense they may have been unhinged. Kael was the daughter of a poultry farmer in Petaluma. The family moved south to San Francisco and she studied literature and philosophy at the University of California in Berkeley. She wrote plays that didn\u2019t work, had a relationship and a daughter. She started writing programme notes for a movie repertory cinema. But she was 48 by the time of her famous piece on Bonnie and Clyde. The picture was rescued from critical and commercial failure (and its producer Warren Beatty knew it), but Kael was lucky too. By 1967, old Hollywood was breaking apart. Arrogant newcomers were looking to make edgy movies about the actual America. An educated, literary elite was taking over the cinema. Kael was writing in the prime of Martin Scorsese, Bob Rafelson, Francis Ford Coppola, Peter Bogdanovich, William Friedkin, Robert Altman, Brian De Palma, Sam Peckinpah \u2013 not to mention the last days of Luis Bu\u00f1uel, the heyday of Ingmar Bergman and key works from Roman Polanski, Bernardo Bertolucci, Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Stanley Kubrick. From the outrage of Bonnie and Clyde to the cultural disaster of Star Wars, writing about movies was living with sex, music, politics, race, paranoia and drugs like flowers in your hair. You felt important; you could claim to be sane. It wasn\u2019t simply that Kael recorded those years as a regular reviewer. Her agitated voice and spurting rhythms were infectious. She was better than some of the film-makers she espoused \u2013 smarter, more giddily romantic and more insistent that they do good work. She ushered in an age of film controversy at dinner parties. She was as competitive as an old lefty, reckless in taking on disciples \u2013 and then telling them what to think. But she wrote like a fallen angel, a slangy, cocksure Satan who guessed God was asleep. She said she saw the movies only once and sometimes she wrote as she watched. That intensity could not last. She took up an offer to go to Hollywood to be a producer. This was a well-intended gesture from Beatty, part of the gamble that hoped a brilliant critic could deliver films (that had happened with the French New Wave). The experiment ended ruefully because Beatty and James Toback, whose Love and Money she tried to organise, were more self-preoccupied than she could fathom. There she was in LA, yet she couldn\u2019t drive. She came home in a sort of disgrace. That wasn\u2019t the worst of it. Movies went off the boil. So many of them didn\u2019t deserve her. After Jaws and Star Wars, the business returned with a restored, juvenile confidence. Movies cheered up because of their kid audience, but a lofty 19-year-old despair had been Kael\u2019s motor \u2013 another sign of existential turmoil. She felt that dismaying shift, long before illness made writing harder. So she was lucky in her timing. But we were lucky, too, those of us who thought our madness didn\u2019t show. Film critics today labour in a gloom and irrelevance Kael could not tolerate. Peter Bradshaw \u2018She was a heroic, live-ammo critic\u2019 Kael\u2019s legendary essay-review about Bonnie and Clyde was published in 1967 in the New Yorker. For a movie critic to read it now is to experience a mix of emotions: glee, euphoria, fascination, exhilaration and shame that you are not doing anything like as passionate and glorious in your own work. It is one of the greatest pieces of journalism or criticism; perhaps the greatest I have ever read. This is heroic criticism, warrior criticism, live-ammo criticism that boldly intervenes in culture and unapologetically takes on everything: the movie, the movies, the audience, the other critics, history, society, politics, love and death. This isn\u2019t simply a demonstration of reviewing in all its habitual simpering passivity \u2013 that type of criticism which is, paradoxically, entirely uncritical, because it eats up whatever film is put on its plate every week and then obediently raises a thumb up or down or at some angle. This is criticism that doesn\u2019t wait to be asked, Kael\u2019s criticism isn\u2019t happy with the demurely submissive \u201chandmaiden to the arts\u201d tag; she is more like Joan of Arc at the Battle of Orl\u00e9ans. Bonnie and Clyde was the movie about the real-life Depression-era outlaws Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow, played by Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty, written by David Newman and Robert Benton and directed by Arthur Penn. As a reaction to the mealy-mouthed dismissals of the film that had been appearing in print, particularly on the subject of violence, Kael published this colossal counterblast, proclaiming the film\u2019s integrity and its importance as American art. Kael hits her stride right away: confident, easy, muscular, with an edge of severity. She compares Bonnie and Clyde to Fritz Lang\u2019s You Only Live Once, Nicholas Ray\u2019s They Live By Night and William Wellman\u2019s The Public Enemy, contrasting these movies\u2019 rhetorical gestures at moralism and comeuppance and finds in Bonnie and Clyde a realism and anti-hypocrisy in portraying the criminals\u2019 occupational normality of violence and the provocative audacity of its humour. She sees Bonnie and Clyde\u2019s indebtedness to the French New Wave and to Jean-Luc Godard and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, but while her cinephile comrades may have been content to notice this in order to bolster the film\u2019s importance and intellectual respectability, Kael\u2019s response is far more challenging and contrarian. She is suspicious of any Euro-artistry and points out that what the French were infatuated with was the Americans\u2019 simplicity and populist power: Bonnie and Clyde is strong and vital when it is in touch with this wellspring, but weak when it gets too supercilious and cerebral. Perhaps the most brilliant thing in the review is Kael\u2019s fault-finding in the film itself, her fierce engagement with its flaws \u2013 which I think is how she managed to get under the skin of Beatty, who perhaps resented his debt to her and resented her l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 in refusing to bow the knee to his superior status as a creative artist and movie star. She criticises his acting at various stages, although impudently comments that producing the film may have concentrated his mind on its scene-by-scene structure and his place in it. \u201cHis business sense may have improved his timing. The role of Clyde seems to have released something in him. As Clyde, Beatty is good with his eyes and mouth and his hat, but his body is still inexpressive; he doesn\u2019t have a trained actor\u2019s use of his body and, watching him move, one is never for a minute convinced he\u2019s impotent. It is, however, a tribute to his performance that one singles this failure out.\u201d The sheer hauteur of this line is magnificent: even FR Leavis telling George Eliot what is wrong with Daniel Deronda isn\u2019t quite as grand. She also, in the course of rejecting the ideas that their movie-star good-looks help glamourise violence, hilariously rejects the idea Beatty and Dunaway are all that pretty in the first place. \u201cThe joke in the glamour charge is that Dunaway has the magazine-illustration look of countless uninterestingly pretty girls, and Beatty has the kind of high-school good looks that are generally lost fast.\u201d How that must have annoyed Beatty. Elsewhere in the piece, she has a shrewd and valuable comment on what is right and wrong with the movie\u2019s editing \u2013 something modern criticism too often passes over in silence \u2013 and she returns to what beame a keynote of her critical career: the importance of writers and the importance of understanding cinema as a collaborative art, and she politely but firmly rejects the auteurist and very male critical cult of the director. She was probably annoyed by the machismo in all that, but isn\u2019t afraid of a bit of machismo of her own, a kind of muscle-flexing and provocation and grandstanding: the essential showbusiness of journalism. She strides up on the stage and takes her place alongside Penn and Beatty. How insipid most criticism looks compared with this. Four critics on their favourite Kael broadsides Klute (1971) \u201cJane Fonda\u2019s motor runs a little fast.

Youssef Zaghba, one of three attackers who together killed eight people in June 2017, told Italian authorities when travelling through an airport in 2016 that he wanted to be a terrorist. An MI5 senior official told the inquest into the eight deaths that the error in handling the tipoff may have deprived investigators of a chance to link Zaghba to the attack\u2019s ringleader, Khuram Butt, before the atrocity. A security service investigation into Butt that began in 2015 over fears he was planning an attack did not uncover his regular meetings and contacts with Zaghba and the third attacker, Rachid Redouane, until it was too late. The families of the bereaved have accused MI5 of missing \u201copportunities galore\u201d to stop the attack. The inquest heard that Italian authorities contacted British intelligence on 15 April 2016 asking if they had any further information on Zaghba. The lost message from the Italians recounted what Zaghba had said a month earlier when trying to fly via Turkey to join Isis. He was waiting at Bologna airport to board a flight to Istanbul on 15 March 2016 and was asked by a border officer: \u201cWhat are you going to do in Istanbul?\u201d Zaghba replied: \u201cBe a terrorist.\u201d He quickly corrected himself to say: \u201cBe a tourist.\u201d The message told the British the Italians believed that Zaghba had travelled to the UK or was believed to have links to the UK. It was not until 9 June that it was translated and passed to MI6, the foreign intelligence service, and copied to MI5, the domestic intelligence service. A senior MI5 official, known only as witness L, told the inquest that the message went to the wrong person who did not realise the need to file it. Furthermore, MI5 never responded, and at that time had no knowledge of Zaghba\u2019s existence or presence in the UK, let alone any potential connection to terrorism.

      "bodyText": "Jordan Peterson, the controversial academic, has launched a new anti-censorship website that will only take down offensive content if specifically ordered to by a US court. The psychology professor from Toronto said that Carl Benjamin, the failed Ukip MEP candidate who speculated about raping the Labour MP Jess Phillips, had agreed to test the subscription-only site, named Thinkspot. Peterson has a cult following among rightwingers for controversial views about identity politics and has become a hate figure for many on the left. Earlier this year the University of Cambridge rescinded an offer of visiting fellowship to Peterson after backlash from staff and students. Peterson said he hoped the site would be a censorship-free alternative to Patreon, an online membership service that at one stage made the Canadian $80,000 per month. He said: \u201cIt\u2019ll be a subscription service. And so that\u2019s partly what makes it a replacement for Patreon to some degree, because we want to be able to monetise creators.\u201d The terms of service for the new site take an extreme position on free speech. Peterson said: \u201cOnce you\u2019re on our platform, we won\u2019t take you down, unless we\u2019re ordered to by a US court of law. That\u2019s basically the idea. So we\u2019re trying to make an anti-censorship platform.\u201d Peterson, who describes himself as a \u201cprofessor against political correctness\u201d said that Benjamin, who blogs under the name Sargon of Akkad, was one of a handful of controversial figures who had been invited to test the initiative. He said: \u201cI think we\u2019ve got four, five or six people who are lined up. [Dave] Rubin is going to use it. I\u2019m going to use it, James Altucher, Jocko Willink, Michael Shermer, oh and Carl Benjamin, Sargon of Akkad.

He said: \u201cI\u2019m backing a new platform called Thinkspot, currently in beta.

He said there were still problems on the site to iron out, but added: \u201cIt would be nice to have a censorship-free platform if we could figure out how to do that.\u201d \u2022 This article\u2019s subheading was amended on 24 June 2019 to change the description of Jordan Peterson from a \u201crightwing academic\u201d to a \u201ccontroversial academic\u201d.",

The \u201cBasic Law\u201d constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2003:&nbsp;</b>Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2007:&nbsp;</b>The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive\u2019s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong&nbsp;Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2014:&nbsp;</b>The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of \u201cfake universal suffrage\u201d and \u201cfake democracy\u201d. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015,&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party\u2019s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2019:&nbsp;</b>Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/hong-kong-lam-to-withdraw-extradition-bill-say-reports\">Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Taking to the streets is perhaps particularly important in a city where people have few other outlets for political frustration and grievances.

      "bodyText": "In Hong Kong, people have most of the freedoms of a democracy except the right to choose their leaders. The city\u2019s last British governor, Chris Patten, described it as a place that enjoyed \u201cliberty without democracy\u201d. That has made protests particularly important as a political tool and an expression of Hong Kong identity. For more than half a century, the people of Hong Kong have been taking to the streets to force distant authorities \u2013 first in Britain and later in Beijing \u2013 to reconsider how they govern the city. This week\u2019s mass demonstrations, over plans for a new extradition law that would allow suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial, is part of that long tradition. And many say they are demonstrating precisely to protect it. \u201cIf this bill passes, we won\u2019t have the right to protest any more. It\u2019s a key part of Hong Kong culture,\u201d said Jason Fong, 19, who has joined the demonstrations with his high school friends. According to Antony Dapiran, author of City of Protest, a history of dissent in the territory, the first major demonstrations in modern Hong Kong came in 1966 and 1967. People took to the streets initially over a planned hike to the price of ferry tickets between Hong Kong island and the mainland, but \u201cthe Star Ferry riots\u201d led to broader protests about labour rights and living conditions. In 1967, more demonstrations turned violent on both sides, with protesters using homemade bombs and the police harsh crowd-control tactics. Dozens were killed in the worst protest bloodshed the city has ever seen, but the demonstrations had a huge impact on the lives of ordinary Hong Kong residents. \u201cThe colonial administration of the time realised they had to start paying more attention to the welfare of the local population,\u201d Dapiran said. \u201cIt instituted various reforms including housing, compulsory education and labour rights.\u201d In the 1970s, protests against a corrupt police chief brought government action on graft. At the end of the 1980s, the Chinese government\u2019s brutal crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square made Hong Kong\u2019s right to protest seem even more important.

Taking to the streets is perhaps particularly important in a city where people have few other outlets for political frustration and grievances. Although there are elections for some seats in the legislature, the system is weighted so people can never choose their own leader. One of the most effective protest movements after the handover to Chinese rule was the 2003 campaign against article 23, a national security law to ban treason, secession, sedition and subversion. Pro-democracy lawmakers and their supporters said it would destroy the territory\u2019s rights and freedoms, and more than half a million people took to the streets to oppose it. Authorities were forced to shelve it indefinitely, and the debacle badly damaged the authority of the first post-handover leader of Hong Kong, Tung Chee-hwa. In 2012, protesters forced the government to make a U-turn over plans to bring in a compulsory national curriculum, which opponents criticised as brainwashing. Those demonstrations helped forge new leaders including the schoolboy activist Joshua Wong, but they may also have alarmed authorities in Beijing. As President Xi Jinping tightened control of Chinese society, cracking down on campaigners and presiding over widely criticised mass detentions and surveillance in western Xinjiang, Hong Kong authorities have also taken a stronger line on dissent. The 2014 umbrella protests calling for genuine democracy in the colony were firmly crushed, albeit after more than two months, and prominent leaders and organisers were pursued through the courts. \u201cBeijing wouldn\u2019t want Hong Kongers to get into the habit of thinking they can get results from protests,\u201d said Dapiran. Despite the determination of protesters stockpiling supplies on Thursday in preparation for more demonstrations, few analysts expect the government to bow to the crowds over the new extradition law. \u201cThe Hong Kong government seems intent to ramp up rather than back down in its efforts to undermine the city\u2019s autonomy in face of huge public protests,\u201d said Human Rights Watch\u2019s senior China researcher Maya Wang.",

In the rules, he was perfectly eligible to race in England but not in Ireland as they\u2019ve changed the rules, so we gave him a flu vac on the Saturday and ran him on the following Saturday, as he wouldn\u2019t have been allowed into the racecourse stables otherwise.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe ran very well [to finish second to Phoenix Of Spain] but we were asking the horse to do impossible things. It would have been much better if I\u2019d simply targeted the Irish Guineas with him.\u201d</p> \n<p>Phoenix Of Spain, who made all the running to win at The Curragh, is the 7-4 favourite to confirm the form next Tuesday while Too Darn Hot is 7-2 to register his first success of the campaign and another Gosden-trained runner, King Of Comedy, is 6-1.</p> \n<p>\u201cHaving said all that, he\u2019s coming up to this race in good form,\u201d Gosden said, \u201cand I hope he shows the quality he has as he certainly hasn\u2019t had an opportunity with his more than interrupted preparation this spring.</p> \n<p>\u201cLast year went so smoothly that it was nearly ridiculous \u2013 maiden, Group Three, Group Two, Group One \u2013 but this year has been quite the opposite.

      "bodyText": "John Gosden, the trainer of last year\u2019s champion juvenile Too Darn Hot, blamed himself for the colt\u2019s poor start to the season on Thursday while also suggesting that the three-year-old is as well as he has been all year ahead of his next start in the St James\u2019s Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot on Tuesday. Too Darn Hot finished his two-year-old season unbeaten in four races but missed the 2,000 Guineas in early May due to injury and has been beaten in his two outings since, first in the Dante Stakes at York and then, just nine days later, in the Irish 2,000 Guineas. \u201cHe\u2019s been probably the worst-managed horse this year,\u201d Gosden said. \u201cWe sent him to the Dante when quite frankly he was 80%. Frankie [Dettori] was trying to settle him further back and ignored the pacemakers and consequently he got there to be second. \u201cThen, very stupidly because we seemed to be missing all the Classics, we took him over nine days later to Ireland and we had to give him a flu vac [before travelling]. In the rules, he was perfectly eligible to race in England but not in Ireland as they\u2019ve changed the rules, so we gave him a flu vac on the Saturday and ran him on the following Saturday, as he wouldn\u2019t have been allowed into the racecourse stables otherwise. \u201cHe ran very well [to finish second to Phoenix Of Spain] but we were asking the horse to do impossible things. It would have been much better if I\u2019d simply targeted the Irish Guineas with him.\u201d Phoenix Of Spain, who made all the running to win at The Curragh, is the 7-4 favourite to confirm the form next Tuesday while Too Darn Hot is 7-2 to register his first success of the campaign and another Gosden-trained runner, King Of Comedy, is 6-1. \u201cHaving said all that, he\u2019s coming up to this race in good form,\u201d Gosden said, \u201cand I hope he shows the quality he has as he certainly hasn\u2019t had an opportunity with his more than interrupted preparation this spring. \u201cLast year went so smoothly that it was nearly ridiculous \u2013 maiden, Group Three, Group Two, Group One \u2013 but this year has been quite the opposite. But the good news is that we\u2019re only halfway through the season so there\u2019s still a lot to look forward to.\u201d Runners from outside Europe are now a familiar sight at Royal Ascot, drawn from across the globe to run in the two sprint events \u2013 the King\u2019s Stand Stakes and Diamond Jubilee Stakes \u2013 in particular, although Australian representation this year is down to just a single runner, Houtzen, in the King\u2019s Stand. The recent arrival of the $13m Everest in Australia\u2019s sprinting schedule in October may be one reason for the drop-off in their team for the meeting but Toby Edmonds and Houtzen\u2019s owners decided to \u201ccome over here and chance our arm\u201d instead. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a big field and very competitive, but our filly is very, very sharp,\u201d Edmonds said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s been great to us and I must thank Chris Stickels at Ascot for allowing us to get in [for a racecourse gallop last month]. It\u2019s a testing track and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here so early, we don\u2019t have that type of track back home, with the inclines and all the rest of it. We\u2019ll see what we draw on Sunday, but she\u2019s pretty quick so we\u2019ll be happy to take a sit off them and then she\u2019ll be strong late and she\u2019s quite tough to get past.\u201d Wesley Ward, who has trained 10 Royal Ascot winners from his American base since 2009, expects to have at least half a dozen runners at the meeting including the juveniles Nayibeth, Maven, who is from the first crop of American Pharoah, the 2015 Triple Crown winner, and Anna\u2019s Fast. His compatriot Joe Orseno, meanwhile, will be making his debut at the Royal meeting when he saddles Imprimis, a live 12-1 chance, in the King\u2019s Stand Stakes with Frankie Dettori booked for the ride. Thursday\u2019s best bets Haydock, which raced on Wednesday, was doomed after a further 10mm of rain overnight, while Uttoxeter reported via Twitter that the track has received 100mm of rain in the last 10 days and that there are large areas of standing water on the course. Friday\u2019s card at Newton Abbott has been called off owing to waterlogging while Saturday\u2019s meeting at Leicester is already under threat with the racecourse reporting on Twitter that, \u201cover the last four days we have had the same amount of rain as the whole of 2018. As a consequence, we are having the course inspected on Friday at 2pm.\u201d The fixtures at Nottingham and Yarmouth have survived, however, which means that there is at least a full afternoon programme, albeit on heavy ground at both courses and soft going at Newbury. There are some interesting contests at the latter track, however, and a very promising individual in John Gosden\u2019s Terebellum (3.00), who makes the second start of her career in the Listed Johnnie Lewis Memorial Stakes over 10 furlongs. The first was an impressive success at Goodwood three weeks ago when the beaten horses included a runner-up who has won since and it will be disappointing if Terebellum cannot build on that on the way to Group races. Infanta Isabella (3.35) has form with cut in the ground and could be the answer to the handicap over the straight mile, while Urban Highway (4.10) is also a fair price later on. Global Melody (3.45) is the pick of the prices at Nottingham while Junior Rip (3.25) should go well at Yarmouth.",

      "bodyText": "Three candidates including Andrea Leadsom and Esther McVey have been eliminated from the race to be Britain\u2019s next prime minister after the first round of voting among Conservative MPs. The former foreign secretary Boris Johnson comfortably topped the poll as expected, securing the support of 114 of his Tory colleagues \u2013 well above the 105 he would need to guarantee a place in the final two. Leadsom promised \u201cdecisive and compassionate leadership\u201d at her launch this week, and McVey said she would make the Tory party more representative of working-class voters. Both women hoped their reputation as staunch Brexiters would help to win over their colleagues, but they were swept away by the carefully planned \u201cBack Boris\u201d campaign. The former chief whip Mark Harper was also eliminated. He launched his campaign this week offering to create \u201ca party where everyone is invited\u201d. Seven men remain in the race. McVey said: \u201cI am pleased to have had a platform to make the case for blue-collar Conservatism, a clean break from the EU and the need to invest money into schools, policing and a proper pay rise for our public sector workers.\u201d Some of those who are entitled to go through to the next round, including Dominic Raab, Matt Hancock and Sajid Javid, are likely to come under pressure to withdraw and throw their weight behind one of the frontrunners. But there was little sign of wavering after the results were announced. Raab, who secured 27 votes, said: \u201cI\u2019m proud and honoured to have the support of so many brilliant colleagues today.

The new prime minister will have just three months to prepare for Brexit by the Halloween deadline set by EU27 leaders. Johnson\u2019s progress into the final round now appears unstoppable unless he makes a significant misstep, and the fiercest battle is between Hunt, Michael Gove and Javid for the second place on the ballot. Hunt was narrowly ahead with 43 votes in the first round, against Gove\u2019s 37 and Javid\u2019s 23, and the candidates\u2019 focus will now turn to winning the second preferences of their eliminated rivals. Rudd, who is supporting Hunt, said once the race was down to a final two it would \u201cstart again\u201d in hustings to members, in which \u201canything can happen\u201d. May will remain in 10 Downing Street until her successor is chosen, at which point her three-year tenure as prime minister will come to an end. The contest was triggered after her final compromise offer on Brexit \u2013 including the promise of a House of Commons vote on a second referendum \u2013 infuriated Tory colleagues.",

      "bodyText": "Jack Shepherd, who killed a woman in a speedboat crash on the Thames before fleeing to Georgia, was not interviewed under caution because of a \u201cmistake\u201d by investigating police, the court of appeal has heard. Shepherd, 31, who was jailed for six years after Charlotte Brown, 24, died on their first date when she was thrown from his boat as it capsized, is challenging his conviction for manslaughter by gross negligence. The web developer went on the run, eventually fleeing to Georgia, ahead of his trial, where he was convicted at the Old Bailey in his absence in July last year over the incident in December 2015. At a hearing on Thursday at the Royal Courts of Justice, Shepherd\u2019s lawyers said he was initially interviewed as a \u201csignificant witness\u201d rather than a suspect, meaning he was not afforded his rights to be cautioned and to have a solicitor present. Shepherd\u2019s barrister, Stephen Vullo QC, said the court would have to decide whether the interview caused \u201cunfairness\u201d and therefore should not have been allowed in evidence at his trial. Driving a boat under the influence of alcohol on the Thames in central London and speeding are both offences under bylaws of the Port of London Authority, Vullo told the court. Police knew in advance that both Shepherd and Brown had been drinking alcohol, the barrister said, and therefore he should have been cautioned. \u201cThe only reason why he was not cautioned and given his rights to a solicitor on the day of the significant witness interview was due to a mistake by the police,\u201d Vullo said. \u201cWhat had happened is the investigation team had contacted the maritime police to ask whether offences had been committed \u2026 They were told no offences had been committed \u2013 including speeding and driving the boat with excess alcohol. \u201cThere were clearly grounds to suspect Mr Shepherd of committing at least two bylaw offences.\u201d Not only was Shepherd not cautioned or offered a solicitor, the barrister said, but he was \u201cpositively told\u201d he was only going to be treated as a witness. Vullo said the interview \u201chad the shape, the form and feel of an interrogation\u201d and Shepherd was asked questions about offences. Lawyers for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) argued there was \u201cno requirement\u201d to have cautioned Shepherd before his police interview. Aftab Jafferjee QC said the safety of Shepherd\u2019s manslaughter conviction was \u201cnot in any sense imperilled\u201d. He told the court: \u201cThe interview was to establish the clear facts of the incident and he was the only individual who could say what happened.\u201d He later added: \u201cHe was never being questioned about an offence.\u201d Shepherd, appearing in court via video link from HMP Woodhill, where he is serving his sentence, confirmed his name at the start of the case. His appeal against the manslaughter conviction is being heard by Sir Brian Leveson and two other judges. Shepherd, originally from Exeter, handed himself in to authorities in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, in January before being later extradited to the UK. At Shepherd\u2019s trial, jurors heard he and Brown, from Essex, had been drinking champagne and headed out on a late-night ride in his speedboat past the Houses of Parliament. The court was told Shepherd handed the controls to Brown just before the vessel overturned, tipping them both into the cold water. Shepherd was pulled alive from the river but Brown was found unresponsive and unconscious. After his return from Georgia, Shepherd was sentenced in April to an additional six months for breaching bail. Last week, he was jailed for a further four years in a separate case at Exeter crown court after he admitted wounding with intent in relation to an attack on a barman. Shepherd struck David Beech, a former soldier, with a vodka bottle in March 2018 after being asked to leave The White Hart hotel in Newton Abbot, Devon, the court heard.",

      "bodyText": "A two-hour \u201cdose\u201d of nature a week significantly boosts health and wellbeing, research suggests, even if you simply sit and enjoy the peace. The physical and mental health benefits of time spent in parks, woods or the beach are well known, but the new research is the first major study into how long is needed to produce the effect. If confirmed by future research, two hours in nature could join five a day of fruit and veg and 150 minutes of exercise a week as official health advice. The finding is based on interviews with 20,000 people in England about their activity in the previous week. Of those who spent little or no time in nature, a quarter reported poor health and almost half said they were not satisfied with their life, a standard measure of wellbeing. In contrast, just one-seventh of those who spent at least two hours in nature said their health was poor, while a third were not satisfied with their life. \u201cWhat really amazed us was this was true for just about every group we could think of,\u201d said Dr Mathew White, at the University of Exeter Medical School, who led the study.

      "bodyText": "Emergency services spent hundreds of thousands of pounds scrapping and replacing contaminated vehicles after the Salisbury nerve agent poisonings, it has been revealed. Police and ambulance services had to destroy 24 cars, vans and 4x4 vehicles following the attack on the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia. The pair collapsed after coming into contact with novichok at Skripal\u2019s home in Salisbury on 4 March last year. DS Nick Bailey, 39, was also taken to hospital. They recovered but four months later Dawn Sturgess, 44, died in hospital after she and her partner, Charlie Rowley, came into contact with the perfume bottle used to spray the novichok. Rowley recovered. A freedom of information request by the Salisbury Journal has revealed that South Western ambulance service (SWASFT) and Wiltshire police spent \u00a3891,922 replacing vehicles after the incident. The ambulance service was forced to discard eight vehicles, while Wiltshire police had to destroy and replace 16. The ambulance service scrapped Mercedes Sprinter 519 CDI ambulances, one worth \u00a3137,318, another costing \u00a356,673 and a third valued at \u00a356,506. It also had to destroy five Skoda Octavia 4x4s, costing a combined \u00a393,334.

Their dad is Catholic, and they\u2019ve been raised in the Catholic faith. When our youngest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/10/transgender-stories-people-think-we-wake-up-and-decide-to-be-trans\" title=\"\">came out as transgender</a>, we struggled. This was five years ago, and there was limited coverage of trans people in the media. We struggled in our own minds \u2013 how can our child know so young? What if she\u2019s wrong? What does this mean? We struggled with our families \u2013 unsure of how to tell them, or indeed how they would react. We struggled with our church \u2013 would we still be welcome? Should we find a different one? A different school?</p> <p>I met with the senior leadership team of our Catholic primary school to discuss support. I also sat with our parish sister, and talked over many cups of coffee. Her response has stayed with me. \u201cWe are talking about a child. There will be people who don\u2019t understand. The world is changing, and the church can be slow to catch up. But your child should be treated with love, compassion and kindness. Who are we to turn our backs on her?\u201d</p> <p>Staff at the primary school explained to fellow pupils, in an age-appropriate way, why our child would be using a different name and pronouns after the school holiday. The only change at this stage is a social one \u2013 there is no medical intervention. I contacted some of the parents. Messages of support came flooding back.</p> <p>The year after her social transition, we flew to Ireland for a wedding. This would be the first time that many aunts, uncles and cousins (as well as my 86-year-old mother-in-law) had met our daughter as her true authentic self. Again, as parents we were nervous. These are the people we care about most in the world; how would they respond to our child? The love from family was overwhelming. There will always be those who do not understand, but I saw the relief my daughter felt at being accepted and not ridiculed. Every day I see her thrive and grow in confidence. I am proud of her.</p> <p>My child\u2019s transition has not led to the \u201cdestabilisation of the family institution\u201d. If anything, family bonds are stronger.

      "bodyText": "The recent document from the Vatican\u2019s Congregation for Catholic Education talks of an \u201ceducational crisis\u201d, and alleges that discussions in relation to gender have \u201chelped to destabilise the family as an institution\u201d. As the parent of a trans child, I find this hugely disappointing. I have two teenage daughters. Their dad is Catholic, and they\u2019ve been raised in the Catholic faith. When our youngest came out as transgender, we struggled. This was five years ago, and there was limited coverage of trans people in the media. We struggled in our own minds \u2013 how can our child know so young? What if she\u2019s wrong? What does this mean? We struggled with our families \u2013 unsure of how to tell them, or indeed how they would react. We struggled with our church \u2013 would we still be welcome? Should we find a different one? A different school? I met with the senior leadership team of our Catholic primary school to discuss support. I also sat with our parish sister, and talked over many cups of coffee. Her response has stayed with me. \u201cWe are talking about a child. There will be people who don\u2019t understand. The world is changing, and the church can be slow to catch up. But your child should be treated with love, compassion and kindness. Who are we to turn our backs on her?\u201d Staff at the primary school explained to fellow pupils, in an age-appropriate way, why our child would be using a different name and pronouns after the school holiday. The only change at this stage is a social one \u2013 there is no medical intervention. I contacted some of the parents. Messages of support came flooding back. The year after her social transition, we flew to Ireland for a wedding. This would be the first time that many aunts, uncles and cousins (as well as my 86-year-old mother-in-law) had met our daughter as her true authentic self. Again, as parents we were nervous. These are the people we care about most in the world; how would they respond to our child? The love from family was overwhelming. There will always be those who do not understand, but I saw the relief my daughter felt at being accepted and not ridiculed. Every day I see her thrive and grow in confidence. I am proud of her. My child\u2019s transition has not led to the \u201cdestabilisation of the family institution\u201d. If anything, family bonds are stronger. Her relationship with her grandparents is a joy to behold. She and her sister argue (most siblings do), but there is a closeness that was missing previously. I\u2019ve thought long and hard about why that is. Honestly? She is no longer pretending to be someone she is not. She can relax and be herself. The Vatican says you can\u2019t choose your gender. Trans and non-binary people don\u2019t \u201cchoose\u201d their gender. They know who they are, and they wish to live authentically and happily. What I will say is that families, friends, communities and congregations can choose how to respond. In our case, they have responded with love, compassion and respect, even when they don\u2019t understand. As I said at the start, I have two teenage daughters.

Convicting more than 400 perpetrators is an exciting and welcomed landmark,\u201d said Simon Richard Mugenyi, advocacy and communications manager at Reproductive Health Uganda.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a massive signal to those who plan to abuse women\u2019s rights.

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of men in Uganda have been jailed for sexual offences against girls and women during a month of special court sessions to clear a backlog of cases. Between November and December last year, 414 men and nine women were found guilty during 13 trials held in selected courts in 13 districts around the country, according to the justice, law and order sector, a body that brings together government ministries working on legal matters. The perpetrators were handed sentences ranging from community service to up to 50 years in jail. \u201cOverall, the objective of the pilot was met with unprecedented success, leading to the disposal of over 788 cases against the target of 650 cases,\u201d said a report. Activists and campaigners have welcomed the convictions, which they described as \u201cdecisive action\u201d that sends a strong message. \u201cWe applaud the gesture of special court sessions on GBV [gender-based violence]. Convicting more than 400 perpetrators is an exciting and welcomed landmark,\u201d said Simon Richard Mugenyi, advocacy and communications manager at Reproductive Health Uganda. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive signal to those who plan to abuse women\u2019s rights. It has been one of the missing links. Therefore, this will go a long away to curb GBV.\u201d Florence Auma, programme specialist for gender and human rights at the UN population fund in Uganda, said: \u201cThe convictions were deterrent enough for those that went through the court process. For those that plea-bargained, the highest penalty was 28 years in prison, including time already served on remand.\u201d The mother of a 12-year-old girl abused by her 35-year-old uncle in the eastern district of Soroti welcomed the decision to sentence the man to 19 years in jail. \u201cI am happy with the sentence and I know it is a lesson for other men in the community,\u201d she said. \u201cEverybody said the perpetrator would bribe the officials and be set free. When I heard the sentence, I felt that justice had been served.\u201d The Ugandan police crime report recorded 14,985 cases of defilement (sexual assault on a person under 18) and 1,335 rape cases in 2017. \u201cSGBV [sexual and gender-based violence] has been on the increase in Uganda.

Mercy Grace Munduru, a lawyer and human rights activist, said the convictions could not obscure the need for the judiciary to learn more about trying sexual violence cases. \u201cThere is need for specialised training for judicial officers who directly adjudicate over these matters; there is also need to comprehensively engage communities in this process prior to establishing special courts,\u201d she said. \u201cThe specialised nature of the courts requires a careful approach.\u201d The report said prosecutions for gender-based violence needed to be handled with greater sensitivity towards survivors.",

      "bodyText": "The ninth of June 2019 was a Sunday. Any other Sunday in summer at Causeway Bay, Hong Kong, old men and women would do their usual walkabouts and maids would gather, spread out groundsheets, cover them with spicy delicacies and listen to Filipino pop songs. But it was not like any other Sunday, at least not for me. Filled with anxiety, hope and anger, I joined the protest against Hong Kong\u2019s proposed extradition law, alongside three classmates from my evening Spanish class. We were hopeful because perhaps there was a slim chance that our government would listen to us, for once. We were angry because our government had repeatedly lied to us.

      "body": "<p>At Hamburg central station it felt like the whole of Sweden was taking the train to somewhere else in Europe. You could hear snatches of Swedish everywhere. When we queued up to buy water, both couples ahead of us were Swedes. An entire handball team from Gothenburg was going by rail to a tournament in Austria.</p> <p>\u201cSweden is trend-oriented: if there\u2019s a new trend, everyone will follow it,\u201d said Anna Maria Hilborn, an art teacher I met when my five-year-old son started spinning around a signpost on the platform with hers.</p> <p>Sweden\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/04/stayontheground-swedes-turn-to-trains-amid-climate-flight-shame\" title=\"\">flygskam</a></em>, or flight shame, movement first came to notice in the summer of 2017 when the singer-songwriter <a href=\"http://www.koldioxidbantaren.se/koldioxidbantaren\" title=\"\">Staffan Lindberg wrote an article</a> co-signed by five of his famous friends, in which they announced their decision to give up flying. Among them were the popular ski commentator Bj\u00f6rn Ferry, opera-singer Malena Ernman (the mother of climate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/greta-thunberg\" title=\"\">activist Greta Thunberg</a>), and Heidi Andersson, the eleven-times world champion arm-wrestler.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12eb07a474c8511184ed261a5d8a17385b454277\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12eb07a474c8511184ed261a5d8a17385b454277/1078_1132_2998_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Concourse, Hamburg Hauptbahnhof, Germany\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Concourse, Hamburg Hauptbahnhof.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Image Broker/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, it was last summer that flygskam really gained momentum. Passenger numbers at Sweden\u2019s 10 busiest airports fell 8% from January to April this year, following <a href=\"https://www.swedavia.com/about-swedavia/for-press/swedavias-passenger-statistics-for-january-2019/\" title=\"\">a 3% fall in 2018, according to Swedavia</a>, which operates them. The number of journeys on Sweden\u2019s national rail network increased by 5% last year and 8% in the first quarter of this year, according to Swedish Railways. Meanwhile, sales of Interrail tickets to Swedes increased by 45% in 2018 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.etc.se/klimat/kraftig-okning-av-utrikesresor-med-tag\" title=\"\">and are expected to rise again this year</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe big thing, of course, was the very warm summer last year,\u201d Hilborn told me once we were on the train to the Rhineland city of Duisburg, the German countryside rattling by outside. \u201cI think it affected people because it usually isn\u2019t that hot in Sweden. It had an impact on farmers: they had to slaughter some of their animals early. And people felt it, too, of course.\u201d</p> <p>Seeing the effects of climate change in the here and now made Hilborn decide that next time she took her annual trip to visit her brother in Innsbruck, Austria, she would go by train.</p> <p>\u201cMy personal impact won\u2019t change a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when a percentage of people start doing something it creates a new norm. So, just by being a part of that movement and sharing it, I\u2019m doing something.\u201d</p> <p>After nearly eight years living in Malm\u00f6, I\u2019m perhaps Swedish enough to start following national trends such as flygskam, which made the official list of new Swedish words for 2018. I signed up to the country\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/jorden/flygfritt-2019/1707677615958314/\" title=\"\">Flygfritt 2019</a> (Flight Free 2019) campaign in February \u2013 even though, strictly speaking, I had already failed, as I\u2019d flown to the UK at the start of January.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa0943b0e47bf81d361971db687fa6cf7a775b8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa0943b0e47bf81d361971db687fa6cf7a775b8c/0_185_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Swedish climate change activist Greta Thunberg speaks at Extinction Rebellion\u2019s environmental protest camp, London, April 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Swedish climate change activist Greta Thunberg speaks at Extinction Rebellion\u2019s environmental protest camp, London, April 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Using the calculator on the International Railways Union\u2019s <a href=\"https://uic.org/ecopassenger\" title=\"\">EcoPassenger site</a>, I realised that by taking the train, rather than flying, on my four annual visits back to the UK would cut my annual CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by about 1.8 tonnes, if you adjust for the impact of emitting at height. That is close to half the total annual carbon emissions, excluding flights, of the average person living in Sweden. To me it seemed crazy to pass up that kind of reduction to save a few days and a few hundred pounds.</p> <p>\u201cYour poor children,\u201d my stepmother said after I announced my plan to travel overland from Malm\u00f6 to my parents\u2019 home in Surrey. My wife, while supportive, had nightmare visions of me and the children stranded on a cold station platform for the night. Though the truth is that seven-year-old Eira and five-year-old Finn loved it. In each direction, they got more than 24 hours of nearly non-stop parental attention, unlimited screen time, and Lego sets and craft equipment bought by their Swedish mum.</p> <p>There was the excitement of passing through five countries \u2013 Denmark, Germany, Belgium and France on the way out, plus the Netherlands on the way back \u2013 and the thrill of racing through the French countryside at 186 mph on Eurostar. At the good-value A&amp;O hostel we stayed at in Hamburg, Eira was inexplicably reduced to hysterical laughter by the large selection of goodies you could sprinkle on top of your yoghurt at the breakfast buffet.</p> <p>On the train to Duisburg, at 3\u00bd hours the longest single leg of the journey, I also met Elin Persson and her husband Morgon, on their way to M\u00e1laga with their four children. Like Hilborn, Morgon is an artist: a glass-blower who transforms used wine and beer bottles into vases. Elin Persson conceded that many of the Swedes she had seen travelling fitted a particular demographic. And it is true that the success of the flygskam movement has generated a backlash, with politicians and columnists in Sweden attacking it as a form of one-upmanship: one <a href=\"https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/g7wEa9/klimatsmarta-resor--en-klassfraga\" title=\"\">where </a><a href=\"https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/g7wEa9/klimatsmarta-resor--en-klassfraga\" title=\"\">middle-class Swedes sneer at their working-class compatriots</a> for taking charter flights to Thailand or the Canary Islands.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c9fbc861dfecac858a02b7a80cbbdd786d1e6bce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9fbc861dfecac858a02b7a80cbbdd786d1e6bce/0_298_7952_4771/1000.jpg\" alt=\"View of Duisburg Inner Harbour, Germany\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Duisburg harbour, Germany.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMostly, it is now middle-class, but hopefully it will spread,\u201d said Susanna Elfors, co-founder of the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/tagsemester/about/\" title=\"\">T\u00e5gsemester (Train Holiday) Facebook group</a> which over the last year has gained 90,000 members.</p> <p>I\u2019d been thrown together with the Perssons by a 20-minute signalling delay that meant we all risked the same domino-chain of missed connections.</p> <p>\u201cYou are the group leader,\u201d the conductor informed me with mock formality as he shared my route, which had slightly better connections, with other Brussels-bound passengers. In the end, we had just four minutes to rush down the underpass and up to the right platform in Duisburg \u2013 with Finn on my shoulders, my wheeled suitcase trundling behind and Eira gamely struggling to keep up.</p> <p>We made it, but the experience underlines the risk of international train journeys in a system not yet designed for them. Instead of buying a ticket all the way to your final destination \u2013 as was the case before budget flights replaced international rail travel \u2013 a sequence of shorter journeys is now purchased. With the ticket I bought online from Loco2, we had reserved seats on specific Eurostar and German Intercity-Express (ICE) trains. If we missed a connection, we would have no right to take a later one.</p> <p>In the days before I left Malm\u00f6, I\u2019d regretted not making more of a holiday of it. Aside from an hour and a bit in Brussels, our only stop longer than 20 minutes was the hour and a half we had in Osnabr\u00fcck on the return leg. We did manage to entertain ourselves, however.</p> <p>Although no one said anything, German travellers seemed less indulgent of small children than those back home in Sweden. But the comfortable table seats we had booked on the German ICE trains were perfect for drawing, playing Lego and making wool pom-poms. The short trips we had on standing-only overcrowded local trains in Germany and the Netherlands were more difficult.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e122b2ed5af46748174319793d863f9d0901464\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e122b2ed5af46748174319793d863f9d0901464/343_0_4469_2682/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hook of Holland terminal, the Netherlands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hook of Holland terminal, the Netherlands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We stayed away from the decent-looking ICE restaurant cars selling German food, such as currywurst and beef gulasch, but indulged ourselves whenever the trolley selling drinks and pretzel breads passed by (although coming from cash-free Sweden, I was astonished they didn\u2019t take cards).</p> <p>In Brussels, we visited an overpriced restaurant outside the station to try the national dish \u2013 some of the worst mussels I have ever eaten. I made up for the disappointment on the return leg, by gorging on deep-fried mussels from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/HoekseVishandel/\" title=\"\">Hoekse Vishandel</a> outside the Hook of Holland ferry terminal.</p> <p>\u201cAre there places like this all over the Netherlands?\u201d I asked the owner. \u201cThere are,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re the best.\u201d</p> <p>In Osnabr\u00fcck, a city in north-west Germany, we missed the medieval centre and renowned zoo but met an engineering student in Burger King who kept the children spellbound as he explained the workings of his self-built electric skateboard.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c94d38688fda175785167f364cd90904b14edb05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c94d38688fda175785167f364cd90904b14edb05/0_84_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Old buildings, Osnabr\u00fcck, Germany.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Osnabr\u00fcck, Germany</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the 45-minute ferry from Germany to the Danish island of Lolland, the children threw themselves around in the wind so wildly on deck that they fell asleep as soon as we got onto the rail replacement bus to Copenhagen. Indeed, Finn was so exhausted that when, an hour later, he threw up half-digested spaghetti bolognese over his sister, he didn\u2019t even wake up. By that time all we had left was a hop over the \u00d6resund Straits, and a short cycle home to our apartment where, at well past midnight, the children were greeted by their relieved mother.</p> <p>The trip took two more days than it would have if we\u2019d flown, but they weren\u2019t days wasted. They might even be the best I\u2019ve spent with Eira and Finn all year.</p> <p><strong>Journey times from Malm\u00f6 to London </strong>By train: from 18hrs 52minutes with four changes (source <a href=\"https://loco2.com/en/journey/malmo-central-london-st-pancras-international-1nyfoas?currency=USD\">Loco2</a>) \u2013 but factor in more time if you want a less tiring journey.

      "bodyText": "At Hamburg central station it felt like the whole of Sweden was taking the train to somewhere else in Europe. You could hear snatches of Swedish everywhere. When we queued up to buy water, both couples ahead of us were Swedes. An entire handball team from Gothenburg was going by rail to a tournament in Austria. \u201cSweden is trend-oriented: if there\u2019s a new trend, everyone will follow it,\u201d said Anna Maria Hilborn, an art teacher I met when my five-year-old son started spinning around a signpost on the platform with hers. Sweden\u2019s flygskam, or flight shame, movement first came to notice in the summer of 2017 when the singer-songwriter Staffan Lindberg wrote an article co-signed by five of his famous friends, in which they announced their decision to give up flying. Among them were the popular ski commentator Bj\u00f6rn Ferry, opera-singer Malena Ernman (the mother of climate activist Greta Thunberg), and Heidi Andersson, the eleven-times world champion arm-wrestler. However, it was last summer that flygskam really gained momentum. Passenger numbers at Sweden\u2019s 10 busiest airports fell 8% from January to April this year, following a 3% fall in 2018, according to Swedavia, which operates them. The number of journeys on Sweden\u2019s national rail network increased by 5% last year and 8% in the first quarter of this year, according to Swedish Railways. Meanwhile, sales of Interrail tickets to Swedes increased by 45% in 2018 \u2013 and are expected to rise again this year. \u201cThe big thing, of course, was the very warm summer last year,\u201d Hilborn told me once we were on the train to the Rhineland city of Duisburg, the German countryside rattling by outside. \u201cI think it affected people because it usually isn\u2019t that hot in Sweden. It had an impact on farmers: they had to slaughter some of their animals early. And people felt it, too, of course.\u201d Seeing the effects of climate change in the here and now made Hilborn decide that next time she took her annual trip to visit her brother in Innsbruck, Austria, she would go by train. \u201cMy personal impact won\u2019t change a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when a percentage of people start doing something it creates a new norm. So, just by being a part of that movement and sharing it, I\u2019m doing something.\u201d After nearly eight years living in Malm\u00f6, I\u2019m perhaps Swedish enough to start following national trends such as flygskam, which made the official list of new Swedish words for 2018. I signed up to the country\u2019s Flygfritt 2019 (Flight Free 2019) campaign in February \u2013 even though, strictly speaking, I had already failed, as I\u2019d flown to the UK at the start of January. Using the calculator on the International Railways Union\u2019s EcoPassenger site, I realised that by taking the train, rather than flying, on my four annual visits back to the UK would cut my annual CO2 emissions by about 1.8 tonnes, if you adjust for the impact of emitting at height. That is close to half the total annual carbon emissions, excluding flights, of the average person living in Sweden. To me it seemed crazy to pass up that kind of reduction to save a few days and a few hundred pounds. \u201cYour poor children,\u201d my stepmother said after I announced my plan to travel overland from Malm\u00f6 to my parents\u2019 home in Surrey. My wife, while supportive, had nightmare visions of me and the children stranded on a cold station platform for the night. Though the truth is that seven-year-old Eira and five-year-old Finn loved it. In each direction, they got more than 24 hours of nearly non-stop parental attention, unlimited screen time, and Lego sets and craft equipment bought by their Swedish mum. There was the excitement of passing through five countries \u2013 Denmark, Germany, Belgium and France on the way out, plus the Netherlands on the way back \u2013 and the thrill of racing through the French countryside at 186 mph on Eurostar. At the good-value A&amp;O hostel we stayed at in Hamburg, Eira was inexplicably reduced to hysterical laughter by the large selection of goodies you could sprinkle on top of your yoghurt at the breakfast buffet. On the train to Duisburg, at 3\u00bd hours the longest single leg of the journey, I also met Elin Persson and her husband Morgon, on their way to M\u00e1laga with their four children. Like Hilborn, Morgon is an artist: a glass-blower who transforms used wine and beer bottles into vases. Elin Persson conceded that many of the Swedes she had seen travelling fitted a particular demographic. And it is true that the success of the flygskam movement has generated a backlash, with politicians and columnists in Sweden attacking it as a form of one-upmanship: one where middle-class Swedes sneer at their working-class compatriots for taking charter flights to Thailand or the Canary Islands. \u201cMostly, it is now middle-class, but hopefully it will spread,\u201d said Susanna Elfors, co-founder of the T\u00e5gsemester (Train Holiday) Facebook group which over the last year has gained 90,000 members. I\u2019d been thrown together with the Perssons by a 20-minute signalling delay that meant we all risked the same domino-chain of missed connections. \u201cYou are the group leader,\u201d the conductor informed me with mock formality as he shared my route, which had slightly better connections, with other Brussels-bound passengers. In the end, we had just four minutes to rush down the underpass and up to the right platform in Duisburg \u2013 with Finn on my shoulders, my wheeled suitcase trundling behind and Eira gamely struggling to keep up. We made it, but the experience underlines the risk of international train journeys in a system not yet designed for them. Instead of buying a ticket all the way to your final destination \u2013 as was the case before budget flights replaced international rail travel \u2013 a sequence of shorter journeys is now purchased. With the ticket I bought online from Loco2, we had reserved seats on specific Eurostar and German Intercity-Express (ICE) trains. If we missed a connection, we would have no right to take a later one. In the days before I left Malm\u00f6, I\u2019d regretted not making more of a holiday of it. Aside from an hour and a bit in Brussels, our only stop longer than 20 minutes was the hour and a half we had in Osnabr\u00fcck on the return leg. We did manage to entertain ourselves, however. Although no one said anything, German travellers seemed less indulgent of small children than those back home in Sweden. But the comfortable table seats we had booked on the German ICE trains were perfect for drawing, playing Lego and making wool pom-poms. The short trips we had on standing-only overcrowded local trains in Germany and the Netherlands were more difficult. We stayed away from the decent-looking ICE restaurant cars selling German food, such as currywurst and beef gulasch, but indulged ourselves whenever the trolley selling drinks and pretzel breads passed by (although coming from cash-free Sweden, I was astonished they didn\u2019t take cards). In Brussels, we visited an overpriced restaurant outside the station to try the national dish \u2013 some of the worst mussels I have ever eaten. I made up for the disappointment on the return leg, by gorging on deep-fried mussels from Hoekse Vishandel outside the Hook of Holland ferry terminal. \u201cAre there places like this all over the Netherlands?\u201d I asked the owner. \u201cThere are,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re the best.\u201d In Osnabr\u00fcck, a city in north-west Germany, we missed the medieval centre and renowned zoo but met an engineering student in Burger King who kept the children spellbound as he explained the workings of his self-built electric skateboard. On the 45-minute ferry from Germany to the Danish island of Lolland, the children threw themselves around in the wind so wildly on deck that they fell asleep as soon as we got onto the rail replacement bus to Copenhagen. Indeed, Finn was so exhausted that when, an hour later, he threw up half-digested spaghetti bolognese over his sister, he didn\u2019t even wake up. By that time all we had left was a hop over the \u00d6resund Straits, and a short cycle home to our apartment where, at well past midnight, the children were greeted by their relieved mother. The trip took two more days than it would have if we\u2019d flown, but they weren\u2019t days wasted. They might even be the best I\u2019ve spent with Eira and Finn all year. Journey times from Malm\u00f6 to London By train: from 18hrs 52minutes with four changes (source Loco2) \u2013 but factor in more time if you want a less tiring journey. For example Richard and family spent a night in Hamburg. By air: from 4hrs 25 minutes, with one stop (SAS). Carbon emissions from Malm\u00f6 to London By train: 53.9kg. By air: 269.8kg (source: ecopassenger.org) \u2022 Tickets booked online at Loco2. Outbound journey: depart Malm\u00f6 3pm, travelling via Copenhagen to Hamburg (accommodation at the A&amp;O Hostel); then to London St Pancras via Duisburg, Aachen (Eurostar from Brussels). Return journey: Stena Line night ferry from Harwich to Hook of Holland, and then to Malm\u00f6 via Schiedam, The Hague, Hengelo, Osnabr\u00fcck, Hamburg and Copenhagen. Trip cost: \u00a3710, for one adult and two children. Looking for a holiday with a difference? Browse Guardian Holidays to see a range of fantastic trips",

Some Conservative MPs have crossed into a place of such profound despair about their party\u2019s predicament that no practical, strategic argument can rival the comforting offer of a magician leader. Not all of Johnson\u2019s backers are convinced that he has the extraordinary voter magnetism sometimes attributed to him, but they believe he has more of that quality than anyone else in the contest. Crucially, they are tired: tired of arguing, of thinking about parliamentary numbers and deals and procedures. They want the bad feelings to go away. Johnson makes Tories feel good about being Tory in a way that few Tories can.</p> \n<p>I have been struck in recent days by how open some of Johnson\u2019s supporters are about their surrender to magical thinking about his prospects. I expect pushback when I suggest to MPs that the whole thing is an exercise in wishing away deep structural challenges, but often they don\u2019t deny it. I have heard the prospect of Johnson\u2019s leadership described by someone who endorses it as a \u201cdesperate measure\u201d. I have heard it described as the action of a team that is three-nil down with 10 minutes to go and as a \u201cHail Mary pass\u201d. For want of an actual plan, the Conservative party is preparing to clutch its special, talismanic charm and pray for a miracle. That is not an offer that is available to the other candidates.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aed1419ab41e1ae76f9e78423b0abcb7b9409d8a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aed1419ab41e1ae76f9e78423b0abcb7b9409d8a/0_88_2609_1565/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Hunt\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018When Jeremy Hunt launches himself as a \u201cserious leader\u201d, he obviously means \u201cmore serious than Boris\u201d.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It gets even harder for whoever else makes it to the final round because he (and it is now guaranteed to be a man) would be competing against two people called Boris Johnson. One served as mayor of London from 2008-2016. He has liberal, metropolitan instincts \u2013 broadly pro-immigration, old-fashioned in his use of idiom, but a moderniser at heart. That Johnson was once celebrated by his party as the <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-vote-theresa-may-replace-next-prime-minister-candidates-conservative-leader-how-a8729576.html\" title=\"\">\u201cHeineken candidate\u201d</a> because, in homage to the old advertising slogan, he could refresh parts of the electorate that other Tories couldn\u2019t reach. He won in the capital, a Labour heartland. Twice.</p> \n<p>Then there is 2016-2019 Johnson, figurehead of the Vote Leave campaign, the ultimate Brexit-booster. He is a more aggressive, divisive figure \u2013 a partisan of nationalistic culture wars who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/09/boris-johnson-sex-life-steve-bannon-tory-leadership-bid\" title=\"\">consorted with Steve Bannon</a>, the notorious alt-right ideologue inside Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. This is the Johnson who compares Muslim women in burqas to \u201cletterboxes\u201d and who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/12/brexit-delay-means-defeat-boris-johnson-launches-campaign\" title=\"\">defended the jibe yesterday</a> as a bit of unvarnished plain-speaking \u2013 the kind of thing the public prefers to \u201cbureaucratic platitudes\u201d. This is post-truth, Trumpesque Johnson who threatens to take the UK out of the EU with no deal and to renege on financial commitments already made to Brussels. He would build an invisible wall and make Ireland pay for it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1ccff83d-d8a5-43c3-aa27-715064256d41\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>The ERG hardcore</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The most resistant segment of the European Research Group of Eurosceptic Tory MPs comprises 28 pro-Brexit backbenchers who have refused to be wooed by Theresa May and opposed her third attempt to pass her Brexit deal. Steve Baker, Andrew Bridgen and Mark Francois are the most vocal members. Jacob Rees-Mogg remains close to the group despite backing May\u2019s deal. Another 100 MPs have been associated with the ERG, including the potential Tory leadership candidates Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Andrea Leadsom.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Blue-collar Conservatives</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Esther McVey, a Brexiter who reluctantly voted for Theresa May\u2019s deal, is the latest Tory to breathe life into the idea of blue-collar conservatism, previously championed by Robert Halfon, the chair of the education select committee. McVey&nbsp;<a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/2019/may/20/blue-collar-conservatism-esther-mcvey-launches-tory-leadership-bid\">launched her version</a>&nbsp;on 20 May at an event widely seen as the unofficial start of her leadership bid. She and fellow MPs including Eddie Hughes, Ben Bradley and Scott Mann plan to tour UK pubs to spread their message. McVey\u2019s supporters claim to have up to 40 MPs signed up to the group; other Brexiters claim the figure is less than 20.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>One Nation Group</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Amber Rudd has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/30/moderate-remainer-tories-one-nation-group-rudd\">spearheaded this pro-remain, anti-no-deal group</a> of MPs, which includes the international development secretary, Rory Stewart, and the former cabinet ministers Nicky Morgan and Damian Green. The group claims to have more than 60 MPs onboard and plans to stand against \u201cnarrow nationalism\u201d and division and in favour of internationalism, environmental policies and protecting consumers from corporations and an \u201cover-mighty state\u201d.<br></p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Scottish Tories</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Led by the hugely popular Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Scottish Tories in Holyrood, and the Scottish secretary, David Mundell, this group\u2019s overtly remain tendencies put them at odds with the likes of the ERG. Among the 13 Scottish Tory MPs and 31 MSPs there is controversy over Boris Johnson, who is a highly divisive figure in Scotland.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Modernists</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>A loose term nowadays, since the former Cameroons are largely nowhere to be seen. Those flying the flag for a more socially progressive, relatable kind of conservatism include the former education secretary Justine Greening and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, who even set up his own app in an attempt to keep up with the digital age. Both Greening and Hancock want to move on from Brexit so that other issues can be dealt with, but they are split on what that should look like. Greening has promoted a second referendum, while Hancock is urging all Brexiters to get behind May\u2019s deal.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Both Johnsons are dispensing wild promises to Tory MPs behind closed doors. Moderates and former remainers have been led to understand that London Johnson is the real one; that he does truly understand the perils of no-deal Brexit, that his domestic policy agenda would not be some turbo-Thatcherite slash-and-burn charge to the right. On the contrary, a liberal social reformer would emerge to renew Conservatism for the benefit of people who feel economically left behind.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Trumpy Johnson is reassuring hardline Brexiteers that nothing is off the table \u2013 not even a prorogation of parliament \u2013 in the drive to get the UK out of the EU at any cost. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/10/boris-johnson-promise-tax-cut-raise-40p-threshold\" title=\"\">cuts taxes for high-earners</a> and lights the bonfire of regulation that Eurosceptic ultras have always seen as the festive culmination of their drive for liberation from Brussels. This Johnson promises to win back voters from Nigel Farage. He is the one that <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/boris-johnson-supporters-want-no-deal-brexit-and-less-talk-of-climate-change-new-survey-of-party-members-reveals-118633\" title=\"\">most Tory members</a> (including an unquantified caucus of newly arrived ex-Ukippers) seem to think they are getting. But the other Johnson is meant to lead a different kind of electoral recovery, shoring up seats that could be lost because pro-European Conservatives flock to the Lib Dems or stay at home on polling day. Self-styled \u201cOne Nation\u201d Conservatives and rightwing ultras each seem to think the other side is being taken for a ride, which suggests they all are.</p> \n<p>It is possible that this strategy will unravel before the end of the contest. Maybe enough people will be put off by the flagrant duplicity that a non-Johnson candidate can somehow navigate a path to victory. But with two Boris Johnsons running, and both likely to make the final round, the laws of probability alone point to someone of that name being our next prime minister. Who he really is, what, if anything, he believes, and what he might be capable of doing is anybody\u2019s guess.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Further rounds will whittle the pack to two. That shortlist is then put to Conservative members, who expect to see Johnson\u2019s name on the ballot paper. MPs have signalled that they will oblige. Unless Johnson is disqualified by sudden scandal \u2013 always a possibility \u2013 he gets a bye to the final. The intervening knockout stages are about identifying the non-Johnson contender. When Jeremy Hunt launches himself as a \u201cserious leader\u201d, he obviously means \u201cmore serious than Boris\u201d. Sajid Javid was more explicit, describing Johnson as \u201cyesterday\u2019s news\u201d and inviting Conservatives to choose \u201ca new kind of leader \u2026 not just for Christmas, not just for Brexit\u201d. The private conversations and bidding wars going on around parliament are even more candid. It is all about who stands a chance against Johnson. There isn\u2019t an obvious answer. Some Conservative MPs have crossed into a place of such profound despair about their party\u2019s predicament that no practical, strategic argument can rival the comforting offer of a magician leader. Not all of Johnson\u2019s backers are convinced that he has the extraordinary voter magnetism sometimes attributed to him, but they believe he has more of that quality than anyone else in the contest. Crucially, they are tired: tired of arguing, of thinking about parliamentary numbers and deals and procedures. They want the bad feelings to go away. Johnson makes Tories feel good about being Tory in a way that few Tories can. I have been struck in recent days by how open some of Johnson\u2019s supporters are about their surrender to magical thinking about his prospects. I expect pushback when I suggest to MPs that the whole thing is an exercise in wishing away deep structural challenges, but often they don\u2019t deny it. I have heard the prospect of Johnson\u2019s leadership described by someone who endorses it as a \u201cdesperate measure\u201d. I have heard it described as the action of a team that is three-nil down with 10 minutes to go and as a \u201cHail Mary pass\u201d. For want of an actual plan, the Conservative party is preparing to clutch its special, talismanic charm and pray for a miracle. That is not an offer that is available to the other candidates. It gets even harder for whoever else makes it to the final round because he (and it is now guaranteed to be a man) would be competing against two people called Boris Johnson. One served as mayor of London from 2008-2016. He has liberal, metropolitan instincts \u2013 broadly pro-immigration, old-fashioned in his use of idiom, but a moderniser at heart. That Johnson was once celebrated by his party as the \u201cHeineken candidate\u201d because, in homage to the old advertising slogan, he could refresh parts of the electorate that other Tories couldn\u2019t reach. He won in the capital, a Labour heartland. Twice. Then there is 2016-2019 Johnson, figurehead of the Vote Leave campaign, the ultimate Brexit-booster. He is a more aggressive, divisive figure \u2013 a partisan of nationalistic culture wars who has consorted with Steve Bannon, the notorious alt-right ideologue inside Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. This is the Johnson who compares Muslim women in burqas to \u201cletterboxes\u201d and who defended the jibe yesterday as a bit of unvarnished plain-speaking \u2013 the kind of thing the public prefers to \u201cbureaucratic platitudes\u201d. This is post-truth, Trumpesque Johnson who threatens to take the UK out of the EU with no deal and to renege on financial commitments already made to Brussels. He would build an invisible wall and make Ireland pay for it. Both Johnsons are dispensing wild promises to Tory MPs behind closed doors. Moderates and former remainers have been led to understand that London Johnson is the real one; that he does truly understand the perils of no-deal Brexit, that his domestic policy agenda would not be some turbo-Thatcherite slash-and-burn charge to the right. On the contrary, a liberal social reformer would emerge to renew Conservatism for the benefit of people who feel economically left behind. Meanwhile, Trumpy Johnson is reassuring hardline Brexiteers that nothing is off the table \u2013 not even a prorogation of parliament \u2013 in the drive to get the UK out of the EU at any cost. He cuts taxes for high-earners and lights the bonfire of regulation that Eurosceptic ultras have always seen as the festive culmination of their drive for liberation from Brussels. This Johnson promises to win back voters from Nigel Farage. He is the one that most Tory members (including an unquantified caucus of newly arrived ex-Ukippers) seem to think they are getting. But the other Johnson is meant to lead a different kind of electoral recovery, shoring up seats that could be lost because pro-European Conservatives flock to the Lib Dems or stay at home on polling day. Self-styled \u201cOne Nation\u201d Conservatives and rightwing ultras each seem to think the other side is being taken for a ride, which suggests they all are. It is possible that this strategy will unravel before the end of the contest. Maybe enough people will be put off by the flagrant duplicity that a non-Johnson candidate can somehow navigate a path to victory. But with two Boris Johnsons running, and both likely to make the final round, the laws of probability alone point to someone of that name being our next prime minister. Who he really is, what, if anything, he believes, and what he might be capable of doing is anybody\u2019s guess. \u2022 Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>The Scottish parliament has voted to ask new questions about transgender identity and sexual orientation in the next census, allowing national demographics to chart Scotland\u2019s trans community for the first time.</p> <p>The census (amendment) (Scotland) bill was passed unanimously on Wednesday evening. The bill, which prepares for the next census in 2021, proposed the new questions should be voluntary, a move that was largely uncontroversial and reflected parallel changes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/23/next-uk-census-may-ask-about-sexuality-and-gender-identity\">being considered</a> by the House of Lords for the rest of the UK.</p> <p>However, during scrutiny of the bill, significant concerns were raised about a proposal from the National Records of Scotland (NRS), which is responsible for the census, that the mandatory sex question should include a non-binary response option as well as male and female. This formula was recently rejected by the <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/measuringequality/genderidentity/genderidentityupdate\">Office for National Statistics</a> for the next census in England and Wales in favour of maintaining the binary male/female sex question and adding a voluntary question on gender identity for those aged over 16.</p> <p>There are also ongoing concerns about what guidance should accompany the new questions and whether individuals will be allowed to answer on the basis of lived sex so that, for example, a trans woman can tick the female box in the sex question.

      "bodyText": "The Scottish parliament has voted to ask new questions about transgender identity and sexual orientation in the next census, allowing national demographics to chart Scotland\u2019s trans community for the first time. The census (amendment) (Scotland) bill was passed unanimously on Wednesday evening. The bill, which prepares for the next census in 2021, proposed the new questions should be voluntary, a move that was largely uncontroversial and reflected parallel changes being considered by the House of Lords for the rest of the UK. However, during scrutiny of the bill, significant concerns were raised about a proposal from the National Records of Scotland (NRS), which is responsible for the census, that the mandatory sex question should include a non-binary response option as well as male and female. This formula was recently rejected by the Office for National Statistics for the next census in England and Wales in favour of maintaining the binary male/female sex question and adding a voluntary question on gender identity for those aged over 16. There are also ongoing concerns about what guidance should accompany the new questions and whether individuals will be allowed to answer on the basis of lived sex so that, for example, a trans woman can tick the female box in the sex question. Previous census guidance has allowed people to declare their lived sex, but policy analysts and data experts have cautioned that doing so again, or introducing a non-binary sex question, would imperil the reliability of census data. The NRS says it is still consulting on the guidance, and that the final proposals will be put before Holyrood for agreement before the census takes place. These anxieties were reflected in a highly critical report by Holyrood\u2019s culture, tourism, Europe and external affairs committee, published in February, which argued that a lack of consultation with women\u2019s groups had led to the publication of legislation that conflated sex and gender identity. Speaking during the chamber debate, Joan McAlpine, a Scottish National party MSP and convenor of the committee, quoted the French feminist philosopher Simone de Beauvoir and said that while she believed gender was constructed, she would support the bill \u201cin the spirit of pragmatism and compromise because I accept that for a growing number of people identity is of deep personal significance\u201d. McAlpine, who has attracted criticism from trans rights activists since her role in the census bill, reiterated her position that the census should ask questions based on biological sex. Ross Greer, a Scottish Green party MSP, condemned what he described as the false framing of women\u2019s rights versus trans rights. He said many of the fears around the bill were misplaced, and that trans inclusion into other data sets, such as those held by NHS Scotland, had not negatively affected the information. He described the bill as an \u201copportunity to lift up the voices of Scotland\u2019s most marginalised\u201d. During the debate, successive speakers called for a more respectful tone to discussions around sex and gender, and condemned threats and violence against women. A number of MSPs referred to the events at Edinburgh University last week, when the campaigner Julie Bindel was left shaken after a trans activist verbally abused and lunged at her. Bindel has previously criticised proposed changes to transgender rights, arguing they will have a negative impact on those accessing women-only services. Others referred to the motion lodged earlier in the week by the Scottish Labour MSP Jenny Marra, which states \u201cthere is no place for violence or threats of violence towards women engaging in public life in Scotland\u201d, and which has attracted cross-party support. Trans people and their supporters, meanwhile, gathered outside Holyrood to call on MSPs to accelerate the pace of change on transgender rights. While welcoming the census bill, James Morton, the manager of the Scottish Trans Alliance, warned that changes to the Gender Recognition Act, promised in the Scottish National party\u2019s 2016 manifesto, had been \u201cdragging on too long\u201d. Morton said the total number of trans men, trans women and non-binary trans people living in Scotland made up fewer than 0.6% of the population, and would not affect the quality of census data analysis. He added: \u201cAll trans women and trans men have always been allowed to answer the census compulsory sex question with the sex in which they live and identify, rather than their biological sex at birth. This must continue to be the case.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Originally, I was going to interview Bill Callahan at home in Austin, Texas. Then he was going to fly to London for a more efficient European press trip. Then his publicist forwarded an email from the 53-year-old songwriter: \u201cEvery round-trip flight from New York to London melts 32 sq ft of polar ice ... in light of global warming, any chance this could be done via FaceTime? These empires must crumble!\u201d</p> <p>Reading about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/extinction-rebellion\" title=\"\">Extinction Rebellion</a> strengthened Callahan\u2019s decision, he says, when we speak by phone, along with hearing a friend cite that chilling statistic. Still, he will keep touring. \u201cPerforming music is worth melting the ice caps,\u201d he says, with a chuckle that clicks like a latch closing.</p> <p>Since his 2005 album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/may/27/popandrock.shopping4\" title=\"\">A River Ain\u2019t Too Much to Love</a> \u2013 his last as Smog, the name he made music under since 1990 \u2013 nature has taken root in Callahan\u2019s songs. Birds, horses, rivers and cattle populate his lyrics, telegraphing chaos, stubbornness, peace, and above all, an embrace of intuition. Less dissonant than his Smog work, this openhearted evolution \u2013 his tender songs elevated by laconic profundity \u2013 has affirmed him as one of the US\u2019s greatest songwriters.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/may/07/bill-callahan-smog-live-hoxton-hall-london\">Bill Callahan review \u2013 from cult figure to force of nature</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet Callahan\u2019s beautiful new album, <a href=\"https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/reviews/albums/bill-callahan-shepherd-in-a-sheepskin-vest\" title=\"\">Shepherd in a Sheepskin Vest</a>, is altogether more domestic, revealing his unexpected new life as a husband and father. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d make it this far,\u201d he sings on What Comes After Certainty. He had never understood the point of marriage or kids. Then he fell in love with <a href=\"https://www.itsnicethat.com/features/in-search-of-bill-callahan-hanly-banks-tells-us-how-she-made-a-film-about-one-of-musics-shyest-stars\" title=\"\">Hanly Banks</a> after she made a documentary about him. \u201cIt was like: \u2018Oh, here\u2019s my wife! And probably the mother of my child.\u2019 It was in her face, her aura. And there was no fear or doubt about it.\u201d On Callahan\u2019s 2013 album Dream River, he used the metaphor of flight to immortalise the awe of romantic contentment: \u201cI never like to land / Getting back up seems impossibly grand / We do it with ease,\u201d he sang on Small Plane.</p> <p>After his son\u2019s birth, Callahan thought he might drop music to become a full-time dad. His wife talked him out of it, but he struggled to start his next album. \u201cGiving birth nearly killed me / Some say I died\u201d, he sings on Son of the Sea, in that suave, mystic deadpan. He chuckles again. \u201cIt was kinda the death of Music Bill for a while, but he was resuscitated.\u201d As his son grew, Callahan eked out time to write, but nothing happened, even as he exercised, meditated and read to stoke the muse. \u201cI was trying to be Superman,\u201d he says. Then he remembered the importance of idleness: \u201cOn your list of things to do, you don\u2019t write: \u2018Daydream\u2019.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I thought keeping things private was the ultimate test for my music. But I tried that. Now I\u2019m gonna be more open</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Once he cracked it, he started writing with arresting candour for a man who has often been described as intimidating, or, he laments, \u201cfiercely private\u201d. Although more effusive now, he remains a careful conversationalist, approaching sentences like a man negotiating a treacherous slope. \u201cSky change the sea,\u201d he sings on The Beast. \u201cLove changed me.\u201d How? \u201cWell!\u201d That latch click again: \u201cI understand community now.\u201d To avoid small talk, he says, he would only \u201crun to the car when my neighbour wasn\u2019t outside. Now I\u2019ll go and say hi. I realised how we\u2019re all linked. I always felt the link from art and having friends but that\u2019s as far as it went. It made me part of the world outside of myself.\u201d Callahan credits his wife \u2013 now a therapist \u2013 with helping him to open up. \u201cShe says honesty is the most interesting thing.\u201d Previously, Callahan believed the opposite, plus he wanted to protect his intimates. \u201cAnd I wanted people to listen unbiased. If someone tells you: \u2018My wife just got hit by a car and died, here\u2019s my song about that\u2019, then you\u2019re probably gonna cry no matter how not-good it is.

      "bodyText": "Originally, I was going to interview Bill Callahan at home in Austin, Texas. Then he was going to fly to London for a more efficient European press trip. Then his publicist forwarded an email from the 53-year-old songwriter: \u201cEvery round-trip flight from New York to London melts 32 sq ft of polar ice ... in light of global warming, any chance this could be done via FaceTime? These empires must crumble!\u201d Reading about Extinction Rebellion strengthened Callahan\u2019s decision, he says, when we speak by phone, along with hearing a friend cite that chilling statistic. Still, he will keep touring. \u201cPerforming music is worth melting the ice caps,\u201d he says, with a chuckle that clicks like a latch closing. Since his 2005 album A River Ain\u2019t Too Much to Love \u2013 his last as Smog, the name he made music under since 1990 \u2013 nature has taken root in Callahan\u2019s songs. Birds, horses, rivers and cattle populate his lyrics, telegraphing chaos, stubbornness, peace, and above all, an embrace of intuition. Less dissonant than his Smog work, this openhearted evolution \u2013 his tender songs elevated by laconic profundity \u2013 has affirmed him as one of the US\u2019s greatest songwriters. Yet Callahan\u2019s beautiful new album, Shepherd in a Sheepskin Vest, is altogether more domestic, revealing his unexpected new life as a husband and father. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d make it this far,\u201d he sings on What Comes After Certainty. He had never understood the point of marriage or kids. Then he fell in love with Hanly Banks after she made a documentary about him. \u201cIt was like: \u2018Oh, here\u2019s my wife! And probably the mother of my child.\u2019 It was in her face, her aura. And there was no fear or doubt about it.\u201d On Callahan\u2019s 2013 album Dream River, he used the metaphor of flight to immortalise the awe of romantic contentment: \u201cI never like to land / Getting back up seems impossibly grand / We do it with ease,\u201d he sang on Small Plane. After his son\u2019s birth, Callahan thought he might drop music to become a full-time dad. His wife talked him out of it, but he struggled to start his next album. \u201cGiving birth nearly killed me / Some say I died\u201d, he sings on Son of the Sea, in that suave, mystic deadpan. He chuckles again. \u201cIt was kinda the death of Music Bill for a while, but he was resuscitated.\u201d As his son grew, Callahan eked out time to write, but nothing happened, even as he exercised, meditated and read to stoke the muse. \u201cI was trying to be Superman,\u201d he says. Then he remembered the importance of idleness: \u201cOn your list of things to do, you don\u2019t write: \u2018Daydream\u2019.\u201d Once he cracked it, he started writing with arresting candour for a man who has often been described as intimidating, or, he laments, \u201cfiercely private\u201d. Although more effusive now, he remains a careful conversationalist, approaching sentences like a man negotiating a treacherous slope. \u201cSky change the sea,\u201d he sings on The Beast. \u201cLove changed me.\u201d How? \u201cWell!\u201d That latch click again: \u201cI understand community now.\u201d To avoid small talk, he says, he would only \u201crun to the car when my neighbour wasn\u2019t outside. Now I\u2019ll go and say hi. I realised how we\u2019re all linked. I always felt the link from art and having friends but that\u2019s as far as it went. It made me part of the world outside of myself.\u201d Callahan credits his wife \u2013 now a therapist \u2013 with helping him to open up. \u201cShe says honesty is the most interesting thing.\u201d Previously, Callahan believed the opposite, plus he wanted to protect his intimates. \u201cAnd I wanted people to listen unbiased. If someone tells you: \u2018My wife just got hit by a car and died, here\u2019s my song about that\u2019, then you\u2019re probably gonna cry no matter how not-good it is. But if you just hear a song, Here\u2019s a Song About My Wife Getting Hit By a Car and Dying, it has to be good or people aren\u2019t gonna listen.\u201d He admits to indulging the myth of the tortured artist in his 20s, even though he wasn\u2019t tortured at all. \u201cMusic was everything to me, and that in itself is kind of a torture,\u201d he says. Callahan released Smog\u2019s debut album, Sewn to the Sky, in 1990. By halfway through the decade, melody was squeezing the rancour out of his early material; by 2001, he reached a purple patch, writing classics such as Dress Sexy at My Funeral, and admitting, on Held, \u201cFor the first time in my life / I let myself be held / Like a big old baby\u201d. By 2005, Callahan was reborn. \u201cI\u2019m new here,\u201d he sang on a song later covered by Gil Scott-Heron. \u201cWill you show me around?\u201d His droll writing reached towards nature, gratitude and other replenishing forces, yet was never saccharine or preachy. Here was a man who, you believed, had figured things out \u2013 with help from the dub icon and personal hero Lee \u201cScratch\u201d Perry. \u201cI read this quote where he said: \u2018I wanna make superhero music.

      "body": "<p>I grew up in Thornton Heath, south-east London. Although raised by a good family in a close community, I was exposed to violence and violent crime throughout my childhood and young adult life. I\u2019ve seen people beaten and stabbed and shot. In 2011, I was involved in an incident where my mum was shot in front of me and my stepfather was shot and killed. I myself spent several years committing crimes, running from the police and, at one point, I went to jail. Although I now appreciate this is far from normal, we didn\u2019t know that almost daily violence wasn\u2019t the norm for most young British kids. I believe that we \u2013 me and my community \u2013 suffer from the trauma of what we experienced, to this day.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/27/stop-criminalising-drill-rappers-say-legal-campaigners\">Stop criminalising drill rappers, say legal campaigners</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Watching other artists make it out of \u201cthe ends\u201d and on to our TV sets was a huge inspiration to me. They didn\u2019t rap about butterflies and happy days; they rapped about a life that was like mine. But hearing their lyrics didn\u2019t make me want to go out and hurt people, sell drugs and go back to jail. It made me even more empowered to make my life successful in a positive, legal, creative way. After being in a music crew for a couple of years, I formed a duo with my friend, Krept, in 2009, and I can honestly say that music saved my life. After the murder of my stepdad, it was music that actually pulled me out of my former lifestyle. Before music, there was just jail, gangs and getting arrested. Without music, I do not know if I would be alive today. Best-case scenario, I\u2019d be in prison.</p> <p>So when, a little over a year ago, the Metropolitan police secured the backing of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to use the Serious Crime Act to <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/police-to-treat-gangs-like-terror-suspects-7zms8gsmr\" title=\"\">prosecute drill artists</a>, I was angry. This means that the police can now treat rappers releasing music in the same way they treat traffickers and terrorists. It means that the police no longer have to prove any link between a song or an artist and a specific act of violence to secure a conviction of \u201cinciting violence\u201d. To the police, it\u2019s justified. To me, it\u2019s just another version of stop and search \u2013 targeting a group of people without justification for a crime that hasn\u2019t actually happened. And that\u2019s why me and Krept are launching a petition with <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/crown-prosecution-service-stop-silencing-musicians\" title=\"\">Change.org</a> asking the CPS to stop the police from being able to ban drill music by using the Serious Crime Act to censor and prosecute artists.</p> <p>Let\u2019s not forget that before the police spotlight was turned on drill, it was focused on road rap, grime and garage. The controversial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/31/form-696-is-gone-so-why-is-clubland-still-hostile-to-black-londoners\" title=\"\">696 live music risk-assessment form</a> was accused of disproportionately stifling youth and black music culture since it was introduced in 2005 until it was finally scrapped in 2017. The police trying to censor young, black, working-class British kids is nothing new. Rather than attempt to talk to young people caught in a cycle of violence, they talk to each other and decide among themselves what\u2019s best.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Expression \u2013 even if when it is violent \u2013 is important, particularly for a deprived and otherwise voiceless community</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>They see black kids running around stabbing each other and, rather than try to understand the root of the problem \u2013 the actual cause \u2013 the kneejerk reaction has been to ban their music, their expression, the very thing helping them leave this environment. I don\u2019t think the police understand that criminals don\u2019t make music. You make music to leave the criminal life behind, so focusing your efforts on the musicians is pointless. The problem isn\u2019t with the music, it\u2019s with the issues that the music is expressing. It\u2019s like looking at the symptom while totally ignoring the cause.</p> <p>So they ban us or make us fill out risk-assessment forms. As well as the threat to our personal freedom and our freedom of speech, by criminalising us and our music, the police also risk taking away an independent industry that is bettering local communities in places like Thornton Heath, Bow and Tottenham in London, and in Birmingham, Manchester and Nottingham. Drill expresses violence, but that\u2019s because we are currently living in that reality and things are getting worse. There are no youth clubs, no schemes, no support. Education is failing kids, the healthcare system is failing us all. But rappers and musicians and actors are actively trying to help.</p> <p>Since me and Krept started making money from music, we\u2019ve opened our own after-school programme \u2013 <a href=\"https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/pa3p7k/krept-and-konan-positive-direction\" title=\"\">Positive Direction</a> \u2013 and our own restaurant, <a href=\"http://crepesandcones.com/\" title=\"\">Crepes &amp; Cones</a>, in Croydon. We employ around 50 people at any one time. These are people from our local community, some of whom could otherwise be leading very different lives right now. And it\u2019s not just us. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/aug/16/stormzy-to-help-fund-cambridge-university-scholarships-for-black-students\" title=\"\">Stormzy is not only funding Cambridge scholarships</a> to young black people, he also set up a publishing imprint for young BAME writers. This is positive action directly impacting communities that most need the support. When I grew up we all wanted to be \u201cthe top shotta\u201d, the big drug dealer. And now, young kids aren\u2019t looking up to gang leaders, they\u2019re looking up to me and Krept and Stormzy, but also to comedian <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/michaeldapaah_/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Michael Dapaah</a>, actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/daniel-kaluuya\" title=\"\">Daniel Kaluuya</a>, footballer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/raheem-sterling\" title=\"\">Raheem Sterling</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealRapman?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">Rapman</a> who just signed a multi-movie deal.

Yes, drill contains violent language but the solution isn\u2019t, and should never be, censorship.

      "bodyText": "I grew up in Thornton Heath, south-east London. Although raised by a good family in a close community, I was exposed to violence and violent crime throughout my childhood and young adult life. I\u2019ve seen people beaten and stabbed and shot. In 2011, I was involved in an incident where my mum was shot in front of me and my stepfather was shot and killed. I myself spent several years committing crimes, running from the police and, at one point, I went to jail. Although I now appreciate this is far from normal, we didn\u2019t know that almost daily violence wasn\u2019t the norm for most young British kids. I believe that we \u2013 me and my community \u2013 suffer from the trauma of what we experienced, to this day. Watching other artists make it out of \u201cthe ends\u201d and on to our TV sets was a huge inspiration to me. They didn\u2019t rap about butterflies and happy days; they rapped about a life that was like mine. But hearing their lyrics didn\u2019t make me want to go out and hurt people, sell drugs and go back to jail. It made me even more empowered to make my life successful in a positive, legal, creative way. After being in a music crew for a couple of years, I formed a duo with my friend, Krept, in 2009, and I can honestly say that music saved my life. After the murder of my stepdad, it was music that actually pulled me out of my former lifestyle. Before music, there was just jail, gangs and getting arrested. Without music, I do not know if I would be alive today. Best-case scenario, I\u2019d be in prison. So when, a little over a year ago, the Metropolitan police secured the backing of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to use the Serious Crime Act to prosecute drill artists, I was angry. This means that the police can now treat rappers releasing music in the same way they treat traffickers and terrorists. It means that the police no longer have to prove any link between a song or an artist and a specific act of violence to secure a conviction of \u201cinciting violence\u201d. To the police, it\u2019s justified. To me, it\u2019s just another version of stop and search \u2013 targeting a group of people without justification for a crime that hasn\u2019t actually happened. And that\u2019s why me and Krept are launching a petition with Change.org asking the CPS to stop the police from being able to ban drill music by using the Serious Crime Act to censor and prosecute artists. Let\u2019s not forget that before the police spotlight was turned on drill, it was focused on road rap, grime and garage. The controversial 696 live music risk-assessment form was accused of disproportionately stifling youth and black music culture since it was introduced in 2005 until it was finally scrapped in 2017. The police trying to censor young, black, working-class British kids is nothing new. Rather than attempt to talk to young people caught in a cycle of violence, they talk to each other and decide among themselves what\u2019s best. They see black kids running around stabbing each other and, rather than try to understand the root of the problem \u2013 the actual cause \u2013 the kneejerk reaction has been to ban their music, their expression, the very thing helping them leave this environment. I don\u2019t think the police understand that criminals don\u2019t make music. You make music to leave the criminal life behind, so focusing your efforts on the musicians is pointless. The problem isn\u2019t with the music, it\u2019s with the issues that the music is expressing. It\u2019s like looking at the symptom while totally ignoring the cause. So they ban us or make us fill out risk-assessment forms. As well as the threat to our personal freedom and our freedom of speech, by criminalising us and our music, the police also risk taking away an independent industry that is bettering local communities in places like Thornton Heath, Bow and Tottenham in London, and in Birmingham, Manchester and Nottingham. Drill expresses violence, but that\u2019s because we are currently living in that reality and things are getting worse. There are no youth clubs, no schemes, no support. Education is failing kids, the healthcare system is failing us all. But rappers and musicians and actors are actively trying to help. Since me and Krept started making money from music, we\u2019ve opened our own after-school programme \u2013 Positive Direction \u2013 and our own restaurant, Crepes &amp; Cones, in Croydon. We employ around 50 people at any one time. These are people from our local community, some of whom could otherwise be leading very different lives right now. And it\u2019s not just us. Stormzy is not only funding Cambridge scholarships to young black people, he also set up a publishing imprint for young BAME writers. This is positive action directly impacting communities that most need the support. When I grew up we all wanted to be \u201cthe top shotta\u201d, the big drug dealer. And now, young kids aren\u2019t looking up to gang leaders, they\u2019re looking up to me and Krept and Stormzy, but also to comedian Michael Dapaah, actor Daniel Kaluuya, footballer Raheem Sterling and Rapman who just signed a multi-movie deal. My area is more inspired by positive role models that it has been in years. There is an even danger that these bans stop our communication with the severely disadvantaged youth of our society. Yes, drill contains violent language but the solution isn\u2019t, and should never be, censorship. Yes, it expresses violence but there are also songs about being vulnerable, about friendship, family, love, God and wanting to get out of the game. There is a long history of suffering in black music, from jazz through to hip-hop, grime and now drill. Expression \u2013 even if it is confronting, scary and violent \u2013 is important, particularly for a deprived and otherwise voiceless community. If you take that away, you not only take away our voices, but you take away any hope of positivity and change. And isn\u2019t positivity and change \u2013 not suspicion and silencing people \u2013 what we need now, more than ever? \u2022 Konan is one half of London rap duo Krept &amp; Konan",

And what they should be asking of us is: \u2018What did you do?\u2019 And I would like to be able to hold up my head and say that at least I tried.\u201d \u2022 The Farm by Joanne Ramos is published by Bloomsbury.

Adnan Choudhry, one of the UK\u2019s strongest proponents of a relatively unknown version of cricket called tape-ball, refers to his sporting journey as a \u201cremarkable thing\u201d. Although relatively few fans in England are aware of tape-ball, the sport \u2013 a version of street cricket developed in Pakistan \u2013 is growing considerably, both in its country of origin and farther afield. Top: Choudhry demonstrates how to cover a tennis ball in electrical tape. \u2018Cricket is an expensive sport to play, but tape-ball makes it much easier,\u2019 he says. \u2018You just need a bat, ball and tape\u2019 The name comes from the use of electrical tape to cover a tennis ball; this ensures players have the opportunity to experience all aspects of hard-ball cricket \u2013 just with less outlay and less risk. Costly pads, helmets and gloves are not required, as the ball poses less of a threat than the traditional, leather-bound wooden ball. \u201cCricket is an expensive sport to play, but tape-ball makes it much easier,\u201d says Choudhry. \u201cYou just need a bat, ball and tape. \u201cYou can play in a car park, a normal park, any place where you can run around a little.

He knew there would be plenty of competitive hard-ball cricket played in his adopted home, but imagined tape-ball hadn\u2019t been exported to the UK. But a friend from Lahore knew where there was a tape-ball game being played in a car park in Leyton, London \u2013 and it was this that helped Choudhry find his feet. \u201cPlaying cricket \u2013 tape-ball in particular \u2013 is how I made friends and connections.

That first game in the car park quickly became a regular event, with spectators becoming players. \u201cWe created a team, and through tape-ball we were able to connect with some local clubs,\u201d he says. Ace Avengers Lions \u2013 the club Choudhry helped form in 2016 that also plays T20 and T10 cricket \u2013 has grown in the past four years from just two friends to more than 100 members. Its creation was partly driven by the knowledge that children in his local Walthamstow area were unaware of pathways to playing cricket, or being able to easily find a club to join. Batting in the Tornado Tape Ball World Cup; setting up the prize table; Choudhry prepares a ball Choudhry also works as a cricket coach and engagement officer for Capital Kids Cricket, an organisation that delivers cricket-related projects in London, as well as coaching on the Chance to Shine Street programme. Both organisations focus on providing disadvantaged people with the opportunity to participate in healthy, physical, activity. Once Waltham Forest council became aware of the work Choudhry was doing, it was keen to get behind the initiative and provide added resources and support. \u201cThis area is quite deprived, and a few years ago the kids here did not have easy access to sports.

The national children\u2019s charity engages young people in communities across the country, and uses cricket to create positive opportunities and show the sport is available to everyone. This year, Choudhry helped host a tape-ball event for the local community that was sponsored by Essex Cricket and Leyton Orient FC \u2013 with the football club hosting at their ground. Local primary and secondary school pupils participated, and 50 visually impaired students from nearby Joseph Clarke school also played an adapted version of the game. Later in the day came the main event, The Tornado Tape Ball World Cup \u2013 an eight-team tournament in which Choudhry\u2019s Ace Avengers were victorious. It was a day filled with pride for Choudhry, who now has ambitions beyond the UK for tape-ball. \u201cIn the future, there are tape-ball teams from Germany, France and Belgium that we are hoping to bring over here to play, or we can travel to play them.\u201d Playing and coaching cricket has enabled Choudhry to play at some of the sport\u2019s most iconic grounds \u2013 the sort of thing most lovers of the game dream of \u2013 and he understands how fortunate he has been. \u201cNow I do coaching sessions at Lord\u2019s, and I\u2019ve played at the Oval too.

The result is a traditional but theatrically effective play that has fine performances from Anton Lesser and Nicholas Woodeson as oppositional churchmen.</p> <p>McCarten is fascinated by antitheses as well as parallels. We first see Pope Benedict, on a weekly private visit to enjoy a TV soap and Bavarian soup, revealing to a horrified Sister Brigitta his plan to retire. We then see the Argentinian Cardinal Bergoglio confronting an equally dismayed Sister Sophia who begs him not to retreat into private life. After a prolonged exposition, the meat of the play consists of a meeting between the two men in Rome that reveals their religious rivalry and shared guilt.</p> <p>There was a moment when Benedict, clutching a red file, recapped Bergoglio\u2019s past career that felt like I was watching a papal This Is Your Life.

      "bodyText": "Having written films about Winston Churchill (Darkest Hour) and Freddie Mercury (Bohemian Rhapsody), Anthony McCarten now comes up with a play about the papacy. More specifically, in exploring the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI and his replacement by Cardinal Bergoglio (the current Pope Francis), he examines the gulf between the awesome nature of the office and the fallibility of its holder. The result is a traditional but theatrically effective play that has fine performances from Anton Lesser and Nicholas Woodeson as oppositional churchmen. McCarten is fascinated by antitheses as well as parallels. We first see Pope Benedict, on a weekly private visit to enjoy a TV soap and Bavarian soup, revealing to a horrified Sister Brigitta his plan to retire. We then see the Argentinian Cardinal Bergoglio confronting an equally dismayed Sister Sophia who begs him not to retreat into private life. After a prolonged exposition, the meat of the play consists of a meeting between the two men in Rome that reveals their religious rivalry and shared guilt. There was a moment when Benedict, clutching a red file, recapped Bergoglio\u2019s past career that felt like I was watching a papal This Is Your Life. But McCarten skilfully highlights the differences between the fiercely conservative Benedict and the more progressive Bergoglio: theology aside, one plays Mozart, the other dances to Abba. The main point, however, is to show that the two men are haunted by a sense of sin: Benedict for being over-protective of his priests and Bergoglio for failing to shield his followers from the military junta. It\u2019s an old-fashioned crisis-of-conscience play but it is directed with exemplary clarity by James Dacre and stirringly acted. As Benedict, Lesser admirably suggests that behind the Teutonic rigidity of someone known as \u201cthe Panzer Pope\u201d lies a soul in torment and a capricious human being who craves affection. Woodeson brings out equally well the earthiness of the football and tango-loving Bergoglio who is racked by a sense of unworthiness.

He\u2019d made his own ramen and he wanted me to see it. Obviously, I celebrated my glorious parenting skills. I had passed on the baton of fatherly enthusiasm. I\u2019d given him both a love of the good stuff and a desire to make it for himself. Go me.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I couldn\u2019t help but feel my father was negligent in not having equipped himself with the necessary culinary skills</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But while I looked forward, I also looked back. I would never have shown my late father pictures of my cooking. Or, if I had, Des would have greeted it with a puzzled, knotted brow, as he scrambled for the right thing to say. When he died, almost exactly five years ago, I wrote about how Des had time for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/may/14/des-rayner-my-dad-jay-rayner\" title=\"\">a good salt beef sandwich</a> or well-made fish and chips, but otherwise shared none of my greedy interests. I concluded this was probably a good thing. It gave me a little perspective.</p> <p>What I didn\u2019t mention then, shadowed by intense grief, was his complete failure as a cook. It drove me completely nuts, but back then I really didn\u2019t want to be critical. It seemed at odds with a man who had been so ahead of his time. My mother had been the lead earner in our house and he had supported her, rather than the other way around. He had been fully involved in every detail of our upbringing.</p> <p>And yet, at the stove he was a disaster. If my mother was working and dinner duties ever fell to Des, I knew he\u2019d be cracking out the wurst, a salty, blunt <a href=\"https://www.ocado.com/webshop/product/Blooms-Kosher-Salami/21074011\" title=\"\">kosher beef salami</a>, rendered a disturbing pink courtesy of God knows what, which despite our lack of religious observance, was always in the fridge. This, he would slice into thick rounds and fry. It would be served with a rubbery omelette made crimson from the leaking processed meat. It was terrible; a meal wasted. I couldn\u2019t help but feel my father was negligent in not having equipped himself with the necessary culinary skills.</p> <p>But as my own son has reached the age where he could start pinging food pics at me, I realise how unfair this was. Des was the product of a particularly feckless man \u2013 my grandfather \u2013 who wasn\u2019t exactly on point when it came to the fathering business. Certainly, he was disdainful of men cooking or, indeed, basic expressions of love. To simply get into adulthood more or less in one piece was an achievement for my dad. Expecting souffle recipes or an intimate knowledge of roasting times as well would be unreasonable.</p> <p>My child, meanwhile, has had a privileged upbringing boasting lots of space in which to share the joy over the perfect bowl of ramen. Frankly, it would be surprising if my boy wasn\u2019t pinging me images of steaming noodle bowls, just as my own dad\u2019s lack of skills was also unsurprising. It would be convenient if I now announced that, this Father\u2019s Day, to remember him, I\u2019ll be knocking up a plate of wurst and eggs. I won\u2019t. It really is an awful dish. But as a dad myself, I think I finally understand Des a little bit more.</p>",

He\u2019d made his own ramen and he wanted me to see it. Obviously, I celebrated my glorious parenting skills. I had passed on the baton of fatherly enthusiasm. I\u2019d given him both a love of the good stuff and a desire to make it for himself. Go me. But while I looked forward, I also looked back. I would never have shown my late father pictures of my cooking. Or, if I had, Des would have greeted it with a puzzled, knotted brow, as he scrambled for the right thing to say. When he died, almost exactly five years ago, I wrote about how Des had time for a good salt beef sandwich or well-made fish and chips, but otherwise shared none of my greedy interests. I concluded this was probably a good thing. It gave me a little perspective. What I didn\u2019t mention then, shadowed by intense grief, was his complete failure as a cook. It drove me completely nuts, but back then I really didn\u2019t want to be critical. It seemed at odds with a man who had been so ahead of his time. My mother had been the lead earner in our house and he had supported her, rather than the other way around. He had been fully involved in every detail of our upbringing. And yet, at the stove he was a disaster. If my mother was working and dinner duties ever fell to Des, I knew he\u2019d be cracking out the wurst, a salty, blunt kosher beef salami, rendered a disturbing pink courtesy of God knows what, which despite our lack of religious observance, was always in the fridge. This, he would slice into thick rounds and fry. It would be served with a rubbery omelette made crimson from the leaking processed meat. It was terrible; a meal wasted. I couldn\u2019t help but feel my father was negligent in not having equipped himself with the necessary culinary skills. But as my own son has reached the age where he could start pinging food pics at me, I realise how unfair this was. Des was the product of a particularly feckless man \u2013 my grandfather \u2013 who wasn\u2019t exactly on point when it came to the fathering business. Certainly, he was disdainful of men cooking or, indeed, basic expressions of love. To simply get into adulthood more or less in one piece was an achievement for my dad. Expecting souffle recipes or an intimate knowledge of roasting times as well would be unreasonable. My child, meanwhile, has had a privileged upbringing boasting lots of space in which to share the joy over the perfect bowl of ramen. Frankly, it would be surprising if my boy wasn\u2019t pinging me images of steaming noodle bowls, just as my own dad\u2019s lack of skills was also unsurprising. It would be convenient if I now announced that, this Father\u2019s Day, to remember him, I\u2019ll be knocking up a plate of wurst and eggs. I won\u2019t. It really is an awful dish. But as a dad myself, I think I finally understand Des a little bit more.",

      "body": "<p>When Christopher Hassall was writing his biography of the poet Rupert Brooke in 1962 he found the woman he most wanted to interview, No\u00ebl Olivier, with whom Brooke had had an on-off relationship for four years, maddeningly uncooperative. To his chagrin, she simply could not see why her own story \u2013 she had lived a long and professionally successful life in her own right \u2013 should be subsumed into Brooke\u2019s, and she frustrated Hassall at every turn. Subsequent biographers didn\u2019t fare much better, though they rightly sensed that understanding Olivier and her three sisters, all of whom had known Brooke, was key to understanding his milieu. In this compelling biography Sarah Watling tells their tale for the first time. It is the story of the end of Victorianism and the birth of the modern age. It is also, grippingly, the story of the early feminist movement, and a vital contribution to the construction of an alternative women\u2019s history.</p> <p>The Oliviers grew up at the turn of the 20th century in the Fabian Eden of Limpsfield in Surrey, surrounded by Russian anarchists and writers and intellectuals. The sisters were raised in line with \u201cprinciples of freedom\u201d, which included being allowed to roam, climb trees \u201clike monkeys\u201d and skin rabbits \u2013 leading their nursemaid to wonder \u201cif all Socialist infants are so exhausting\u201d. They were fortunate, at a time when any sort of intellectual study was believed to be damaging to the female reproductive system, to have a father, Sydney Olivier (later a member of Ramsay MacDonald\u2019s postwar Labour cabinet), who arranged tuition for them with a lecturer from University College London, while their mother, Margaret Cox, encouraged political engagement.</p> <p>For the Olivier women, suffrage, the burning topic of the day, was a family matter. Margery, the eldest sister, marched in suffrage processions beside her mother. The younger girls, Brynhild, Daphne and No\u00ebl, brimming with Olivier self-confidence, were dismayed at having to listen to men they regarded as \u201ccertainly not qualified to vote\u201d discussing politics. All except Bryn took up the chance of a university education denied to the previous generation. They enrolled in Newnham College, Cambridge, but became frustrated with a society \u201cthat offered them these opportunities as gifts without extending them rights\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cd5a343e324a5bce79bd86710dcd883a9a6620b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd5a343e324a5bce79bd86710dcd883a9a6620b2/188_276_1131_1413/800.jpg\" alt=\"Principles of freedom \u2026 the sisters were allowed to climb trees like monkeys.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Principles of freedom \u2026 the sisters were allowed to climb trees like monkeys.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anne Olivier Bell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The bucolic idealism underpinning the Fabian worldview was expressed in the sisters\u2019 passion for all things natural and outdoorsy. At Cambridge their circle included Brooke and his friends in the Apostles, who joined them in the communal camping expeditions for which the group became known. Insofar as they had a philosophy it was one in line with Rupert\u2019s brand of bohemianism: an odd blend of athleticism, nudity and childlike camaraderie. During extended camping trips in the New Forest, Kent and Dartmoor they slept in the open, swam naked and developed indiscriminate but chaste crushes on each other. They were sometimes joined by the Bloomsberries James Strachey (brother of Lytton) and Virginia Stephen (later Woolf). Virginia, incorrigibly urban and sceptical, gave them the name \u201cNeo-Pagans\u201d while seeming flummoxed by the Oliviers\u2019 self-sufficiency and lack of the usual feminine responses (\u201cShe has a glass eye,\u201d she wrote waspishly about Bryn, \u201cone can imagine her wiping it bright in the morning with a duster\u201d).</p> <p>Brooke was equally vexed by them. He seems to have fallen for each of the sisters in turn, but his most persistent attachment was to No\u00ebl, whom he met in 1908 when he was 20 and she still a schoolgirl of 15. He does not come out of the episode well. After wooing her for years with mixed success, he was finally defeated by her sexual reticence and her determination to pursue a medical career and live an independent life. In a nasty letter he told Strachey, who was also in love with her, that there was no point in sacrificing their friendship \u201cfor an off chance at a cunt\u201d, predicting that No\u00ebl would get her comeuppance one day, \u201cwhen she\u2019ll suddenly feel a sort of collapse &amp; sliding in her womb, &amp; incomprehensible longings. It\u2019s when the ova suddenly begin popping out like peas.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a valuable moment of insight into the tortuous psychosexual makeup of a man whom Watling otherwise treats only sketchily. In her admirable drive to foreground the women in this story, the male players can become two-dimensional. Brooke, who was struggling at the time with an awareness of his own bisexuality, suffered a nervous breakdown in 1912. Watling says nothing about the confusion and self-disgust that triggered his collapse, preferring to ascribe it to his simultaneous rejection by No\u00ebl and by another love interest, Ka Cox. She is quite brilliant, however, at gauging the Olivier sisters\u2019 reaction to Brooke\u2019s sudden apotheosis on his death in the Aegean in 1915 as patriotic demigod. Overnight, with the publication in the Times of an obituary written by Winston Churchill, \u201cthe flawed man of whom they had unfiltered experience was transformed into a mythological hero before their eyes\u201d. No\u00ebl was excised from the sanitised memoir of Brooke rushed out soon after by Eddie Marsh, after which she steadfastly ignored requests by biographers to see his letters.

No\u00ebl tried to refer her to Sigmund Freud for treatment, but he declined. Margery became increasingly violent and was evicted from various nursing homes before eventually being diagnosed as schizophrenic. You have to wonder what role the mood of conservatism after the first world war played in the disintegration of such women. Daphne, a teacher who survived her own brush with mental illness, reacted to a narrowing set of options by looking for fulfilment in spiritual terms, falling under the spell of Rudolf Steiner and his anthroposophical gobbledygook.

      "bodyText": "Argentina had just drawn 0-0 against Japan at Parc des Princes in Paris on Monday, yet the players collapsed in joy as if celebrating an epic victory. For the casual viewer it must have seemed an exaggerated celebration but for anyone familiar with what the Argentinian players have gone through it was completely understandable. They are essentially an amateur team and were playing against the team that won the 2011 World Cup and reached the final four years later. In fact, it is a small miracle they are even in France and going into their second group game, against Phil Neville\u2019s England in Le Havre on Friday, with renewed belief. The Argentina team are not new to major tournaments but a fourth-place finish at the unofficial 1971 Women\u2019s World Championship was followed by disappointing showings in the Fifa events in 2003 and 2007. In the latter two, Argentina had a negative goal difference of 31, only managing to score a single goal in each tournament. As Argentina prepare to play England for the third time \u2013 they won 4-1 in 1971 but lost 6-1 in 2007 \u2013 it is worth considering why the draw with Japan carried so much weight. Going back just one year, it was unclear if the team would be able to travel to France at all.

Despite being the world's riskiest place \u2013 with 37 million people vulnerable to tsunami, flooding and due a potentially catastrophic earthquake \u2013 it is also one of the most resilient, both in its hi-tech design and its pragmatic social structure.

As cities from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/aug/29/river-runs-global-movement-daylight-urban-rivers\">Seoul to Chicago to Sheffield</a> revitalise their waterfront areas with huge economic and environmental benefits, Tokyo has turned its back on water. Its rivers have been allowed to stagnate. Streams have been filled in, highways built directly over rivers. Waterways used to be a key method of transport and cultural life. Now the rivers and canals are dirty, desolate and nearly deserted.</p> \n<p>Fly over Tokyo and you will almost certainly spot at least one of the four megarivers that converge on the city: the Arakawa, Sumidagawa, Edogawa and Tamagawa. These broad, shimmering belts are just the main ones: more than 100 natural rivers and manmade canals flow underneath a city now more famous for glass, steel and concrete.</p> \n<p>In fact, it was water management that made Edo, as Tokyo was known, larger than London by 1700. Warehouses lined Tokyo Bay, goods travelled up the rivers and canals just as they now do on roads, while theatres, teahouses and, inevitably, the red light district took advantage of the bustling waterways.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"612a68bac2ee12142720d18ebbd66aef86186752\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/612a68bac2ee12142720d18ebbd66aef86186752/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An ukiyo-e print from c 1830 showing boats on a canal.

Flat roads lined with lush greenery, for example, often indicate a buried stream. Temples and graveyards suggest a <em>suribachi</em>: a natural hollow in one of the city\u2019s hills, where a spring and pond used to be.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs Tokyo has modernised, the role of water has disappeared,\u201d says Prof Hidenobu Jinnai of Hosei University. \u201cBut the past memory and images still exist in today\u2019s Tokyo and are an important factor in understanding the identity of Tokyo.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/12/this-is-not-a-what-if-story-tokyo-braces-for-the-earthquake-of-a-century\">'This is not a \"what if\" story': Tokyo braces for the earthquake of a century</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Great Kanto earthquake of 1923 was the first rupture with the city\u2019s water-based development. The extensive rebuilding saw planners embrace more western styles of building. Further reconstruction after the second world war \u2013 when Tokyo was burned to the ground \u2013 and then the run-up to the 1964 Olympic Games decisively turned the face of the city away from water, and not for the better, says Jinnai.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe Tokyo Olympics in 1964 decisively caused the loss of [Tokyo as a] \u2018water city\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cTokyo\u2019s water quality got worse because of the pollution. Highways covered many waterways, Tokyo Bay, industrialisation, traffic, transport \u2026 these are the reasons that people became distanced from the water.\u201d</p> \n<p>A recent boat trip along the Sumida river with Akira Abe of the Machifune Mirai Juku waterway activists revealed miles of faceless industrial development and grey residential towers.

      "bodyText": "Of the near-endless flow of people over the busy Shibuya scramble crossing every day, few realise that beneath their feet is something else flowing, unseen and unnoticed: the crossing of two ancient rivers, the Uda and the Onden. Beneath all the concrete and neon, Tokyo is a city built on water. It is the reason the Japanese capital\u2019s 37 million citizens are here at all. From fishing village to seat of political power, canny water management was a key driver of the city\u2019s extraordinary growth. You\u2019d never know it today. As cities from Seoul to Chicago to Sheffield revitalise their waterfront areas with huge economic and environmental benefits, Tokyo has turned its back on water. Its rivers have been allowed to stagnate. Streams have been filled in, highways built directly over rivers. Waterways used to be a key method of transport and cultural life. Now the rivers and canals are dirty, desolate and nearly deserted. Fly over Tokyo and you will almost certainly spot at least one of the four megarivers that converge on the city: the Arakawa, Sumidagawa, Edogawa and Tamagawa. These broad, shimmering belts are just the main ones: more than 100 natural rivers and manmade canals flow underneath a city now more famous for glass, steel and concrete. In fact, it was water management that made Edo, as Tokyo was known, larger than London by 1700. Warehouses lined Tokyo Bay, goods travelled up the rivers and canals just as they now do on roads, while theatres, teahouses and, inevitably, the red light district took advantage of the bustling waterways. The era\u2019s famous ukiyo-e or \u201cfloating world\u201d woodblock prints reflect the centrality of water to the life of the city. European visitors compared it with their own continent\u2019s great water city: \u201cIn all things Edo presents peaceful harmony,\u201d wrote Aime Humbert, a Swiss envoy, of the city between 1863 and 1864. \u201cWhere does one find its like in Europe? Only along the banks and in the squares of the Queen of the Adriatic, Venice herself.\u201d Today, comparisons with Venice are thin on the ground, but you can still find evidence of water running vein-like under the city\u2019s concrete skin, if you know where and how to look. Flat roads lined with lush greenery, for example, often indicate a buried stream. Temples and graveyards suggest a suribachi: a natural hollow in one of the city\u2019s hills, where a spring and pond used to be. \u201cAs Tokyo has modernised, the role of water has disappeared,\u201d says Prof Hidenobu Jinnai of Hosei University. \u201cBut the past memory and images still exist in today\u2019s Tokyo and are an important factor in understanding the identity of Tokyo.\u201d The Great Kanto earthquake of 1923 was the first rupture with the city\u2019s water-based development. The extensive rebuilding saw planners embrace more western styles of building. Further reconstruction after the second world war \u2013 when Tokyo was burned to the ground \u2013 and then the run-up to the 1964 Olympic Games decisively turned the face of the city away from water, and not for the better, says Jinnai. \u201cThe Tokyo Olympics in 1964 decisively caused the loss of [Tokyo as a] \u2018water city\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cTokyo\u2019s water quality got worse because of the pollution. Highways covered many waterways, Tokyo Bay, industrialisation, traffic, transport \u2026 these are the reasons that people became distanced from the water.\u201d A recent boat trip along the Sumida river with Akira Abe of the Machifune Mirai Juku waterway activists revealed miles of faceless industrial development and grey residential towers. Strict regulations on building within the river\u2019s flood zone were relaxed in 2004, and again in 2011, but few developers have seized the opportunity. As you travel up quieter canals and tributaries, there is a sense of gloom and neglect \u2013 but also of possibility. Abe points out the overhanging cherry trees: sakura season is beautiful on the Edo-era canals, he says. Over two and a half hours on the boat, very little water traffic passes; the exceptions are a futuristic-looking tourist waterbus, designed by manga artist Leiji Matsumoto, and a yellow six-seater water taxi. \u201cYou need to book six months ahead to get a trip on one of those,\u201d jokes Abe. The lack of boats is partly because of fire restrictions at docks, many of which are designated for emergency use only. Docks are also managed separately by national, metropolitan and ward authorities, with little coordination, making it complicated for businesses to make use of them. But it is also a legacy of the 1964 Games, which saw a rapid revision of the city\u2019s transport infrastructure at the cost of the waterways. Multi-lane highways were built directly above rivers and canals, to avoid the cost of purchasing and clearing land. The Nihonbashi river and its beautiful Meiji-era bridge were particularly noticeable victims, but the effect on the ecology and the economy of the waterways was even more devastating. Already polluted by years of sewage and industrial runoff, the planting of concrete support columns into rivers caused further stagnation and pollution of the water, as well as making the waterways unusable to many commercial craft. With the eyes of the world trained on Tokyo, streams were considered so irredeemably polluted that they were filled in with construction rubble, then concreted over. Others were culverted to conceal the stench and sludgy flow, becoming roads instead (and arguably simply replacing one form of pollution with another). The one bright spot water-wise was the development of a modern sewage system. Tokyo toilets are the envy of the world, and stopped one form of pollution at least from entering the water network. In more recent years, there have been attempts to reconnect Tokyo with its waterfront, most notably the Odaiba land reclamation project.

Given the climate, you might reasonably ask, whither the lower-division strivers of yesteryear, their moment in the sun a decade hence?</p> <p>The answer seems to be: touring venues rather larger than you might expect. The current tour by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/whiteliesmusic?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">White Lies</a> winds up with not one, but two dates at Brixton Academy.

That said, a sense that fashion has moved on does infect the fourth album by Two Door Cinema Club, the anonymous Northern Irish trio whose sales peak ostensibly came with their 2010 debut <a href=\"https://consequenceofsound.net/2010/05/album-review-two-door-cinema-club-tourist-history/\">Tourist History</a>, but whose forthcoming tour nevertheless takes in \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 the O2 Arena. Tourist History dealt in then-hip angular post-punk with commercial ambitions, but their ensuing two albums amped up the electronics. On the Jacknife Lee-produced False Alarm they take over almost entirely, leaving their music somewhere in the general vicinity of the 1975 at their least arty and most radio-friendly.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t, in itself, a bad idea, and not merely because it feels more modish than their initial musical approach. Some of the results feel either commonplace or, worse, flimsy and annoying \u2013 perhaps unwittingly, Satellite sounds like mid-80s Europop, and thus proves something of an endurance test if you don\u2019t have a lasting love for the oeuvre of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kHl4FoK1Ys\">Modern Talking</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSohWfEoHf8\">FR David</a> \u2013 but there are tunes here that suit the makeover. Dirty Air and Satisfaction Guaranteed have strong hooks. Nice to See You ropes in Zimbabwean band <a href=\"https://www.mokoomba.band/\">Mokoomba</a> on backing vocals and rapper <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/artists/30520-open-mike-eagle/\">Open Mike Eagle</a>, then spends six minutes crossing its fingers that someone will compare it to Talking Heads, or Fashion by David Bowie. No chance, but it is a decent song in its own right. Similarly, frontman Alex Trimble has described the brief Break as coming from \u201cthe McCartney school of songwriting\u201d. That rather amounts to gilding the lily \u2013 the tinny staccato synths vaguely resemble Wonderful Christmastime and that\u2019s about it \u2013 but it\u2019s a sweet melodic fragment nonetheless.</p> <p>The lyrics are largely centred around the internet. Listeners are advised to don body armour and goggles, lest they get hit by shrapnel from the truth bombs that follow. We variously learn that social media isn\u2019t necessarily a force for unmitigated good, that defining yourself by the number of \u201clikes\u201d you get is a bad idea, that the image people project online often fails to reflect reality and that some people are using it to sell us things: watch out, manufacturers of Huel, Mahabi slippers and the Noom diet system, Two Door Cinema Club have totally got your number. These are inarguable points, but it\u2019s also inarguable that they\u2019ve been made before, umpteen times, and in some cases by Two Door Cinema Club, whose 2016 album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/13/two-door-cinema-club-gameshow-album-review\">Gameshow</a> also socked it to social media and consumerism.</p> <p>Their fusillade against the internet highlights the problem with False Alarm. It isn\u2019t a bad album \u2013 the songs are largely alright, the production neat \u2013 but there\u2019s nothing on it that you haven\u2019t heard already. Moreover, Two Door Cinema Club don\u2019t have enough personality to impose any kind of distinctive character on the material: nothing is given a unique spin or a different slant. You could say that was the trouble with noughties indie 2.0 from the start, but it didn\u2019t stop it getting huge a decade ago, and \u2013 given the ongoing appetite for this kind of thing \u2013 you doubt if it\u2019ll stop anyone buying False Alarm, or indeed, filling the O2 Arena.</p> <h2>This week Alexis listened to</h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://caribouband.bandcamp.com/album/sizzling-ep\">Daphni: Sizzling (feat Paradise)</a></strong></p> <p>Paradise\u2019s obscure 1981 boogie track <a href=\"https://frederiksbergrecords.bandcamp.com/album/sizzlin-hot\">Sizzlin\u2019 Hot</a> reworked by the masterful Dan Snaith into frantic-paced, full-on, four-to-the-floor disco.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Does 2019 offer a more baffling musical phenomenon than the continued success of what you might call second-wave noughties indie? Not the bands that erupted into the public consciousness at the start of the decade, with their huge hit singles and era-defining albums and identifiable images eagerly co-opted by fans \u2013 Coldplay, the Killers, the Libertines et al \u2013 but the ones who came five years later, damned as \u201clandfill indie\u201d, so nondescript you imagined them convening for rehearsals and peering puzzled at their bandmates: \u201cSorry, do I know you?\u201d These are, after all, widely held to be thin times indeed for the kind of mainstream alt-rock that was once the NME\u2019s lifeblood: the one thing noticeable by its absence on the main stage at this year\u2019s Glastonbury is a hot young guitar band, catapulted to fame on a firework trajectory by overheated media attention, including at least one front cover that excitedly claims \u201cTHIS BAND WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE\u201d. Over on the Radio 1 playlist, the Amazons offer a solitary, exception-that-proves-the-rule hold-out, swamped by hip-hop, grime and pop. Given the climate, you might reasonably ask, whither the lower-division strivers of yesteryear, their moment in the sun a decade hence? The answer seems to be: touring venues rather larger than you might expect. The current tour by White Lies winds up with not one, but two dates at Brixton Academy. Earlier this year, the Wombats headlined Wembley Arena. The Courteeners keep packing stadiums in the north of England. Whatever next? The Spice Girls\u2019 record for consecutive London arena sell-outs quietly broken by Scouting for Girls? A stampede for tickets caused by the re-formation of Joe Lean &amp; the Jing Jang Jong? You could read this as revealing a lot about how what\u2019s deemed fashionable doesn\u2019t always reflect what\u2019s actually popular. That said, a sense that fashion has moved on does infect the fourth album by Two Door Cinema Club, the anonymous Northern Irish trio whose sales peak ostensibly came with their 2010 debut Tourist History, but whose forthcoming tour nevertheless takes in \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 the O2 Arena. Tourist History dealt in then-hip angular post-punk with commercial ambitions, but their ensuing two albums amped up the electronics. On the Jacknife Lee-produced False Alarm they take over almost entirely, leaving their music somewhere in the general vicinity of the 1975 at their least arty and most radio-friendly. This isn\u2019t, in itself, a bad idea, and not merely because it feels more modish than their initial musical approach. Some of the results feel either commonplace or, worse, flimsy and annoying \u2013 perhaps unwittingly, Satellite sounds like mid-80s Europop, and thus proves something of an endurance test if you don\u2019t have a lasting love for the oeuvre of Modern Talking and FR David \u2013 but there are tunes here that suit the makeover. Dirty Air and Satisfaction Guaranteed have strong hooks. Nice to See You ropes in Zimbabwean band Mokoomba on backing vocals and rapper Open Mike Eagle, then spends six minutes crossing its fingers that someone will compare it to Talking Heads, or Fashion by David Bowie. No chance, but it is a decent song in its own right. Similarly, frontman Alex Trimble has described the brief Break as coming from \u201cthe McCartney school of songwriting\u201d. That rather amounts to gilding the lily \u2013 the tinny staccato synths vaguely resemble Wonderful Christmastime and that\u2019s about it \u2013 but it\u2019s a sweet melodic fragment nonetheless. The lyrics are largely centred around the internet. Listeners are advised to don body armour and goggles, lest they get hit by shrapnel from the truth bombs that follow. We variously learn that social media isn\u2019t necessarily a force for unmitigated good, that defining yourself by the number of \u201clikes\u201d you get is a bad idea, that the image people project online often fails to reflect reality and that some people are using it to sell us things: watch out, manufacturers of Huel, Mahabi slippers and the Noom diet system, Two Door Cinema Club have totally got your number. These are inarguable points, but it\u2019s also inarguable that they\u2019ve been made before, umpteen times, and in some cases by Two Door Cinema Club, whose 2016 album Gameshow also socked it to social media and consumerism. Their fusillade against the internet highlights the problem with False Alarm. It isn\u2019t a bad album \u2013 the songs are largely alright, the production neat \u2013 but there\u2019s nothing on it that you haven\u2019t heard already. Moreover, Two Door Cinema Club don\u2019t have enough personality to impose any kind of distinctive character on the material: nothing is given a unique spin or a different slant. You could say that was the trouble with noughties indie 2.0 from the start, but it didn\u2019t stop it getting huge a decade ago, and \u2013 given the ongoing appetite for this kind of thing \u2013 you doubt if it\u2019ll stop anyone buying False Alarm, or indeed, filling the O2 Arena. This week Alexis listened to Daphni: Sizzling (feat Paradise) Paradise\u2019s obscure 1981 boogie track Sizzlin\u2019 Hot reworked by the masterful Dan Snaith into frantic-paced, full-on, four-to-the-floor disco.",

Yet no style gets discriminated against quite like ros\u00e9. It\u2019s all sweet, we\u2019re told, or it\u2019s only for women, or for summer, or for women in summer \u2026 </p> <p>For a long time, ros\u00e9 was disregarded because good winemakers didn\u2019t make it: star California winemaker Rajat Parr, who was a San Francisco sommelier in the 1990s, once said: \u201cNo one cared about it, no one thought about it, no one drank it.\u201d That, thank goodness, has changed \u2013 yet the prejudices remain. So let\u2019s bust a few persistent myths.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/may/31/fiona-beckett-rose-drink-summer-wine\">In the pink: why ros\u00e9 is the drink for this summer | Fiona Beckett on wine</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Ros\u00e9 </strong><strong>is a new trend</strong></h2> <p>The ancients were probably drinking pink when Julius Caesar was knee-high to a grasshopper. In ancient Greece and Rome, white and red grapes would often have been crushed together, by foot, and the contact of the juice with red grapeskins would have meant that most wine was some version of red. Since the rules of classical civilisation held that all wine must be diluted with water \u2013 only barbarians drank it straight \u2013 a lot of that juice would have wound up a shade of pink.</p> <h2><strong>You make ros\u00e9 by blending red and white wine</strong><br></h2> <p>In ancient times, essentially yes, since, as noted, all the grapes were mixed together. These days we do things a little differently. There are two ways to make ros\u00e9 now: the saign\u00e9e method and skin contact. The former involves bleeding off some juice after red grapes have been pressed: that juice becomes a lightly tinted wine, while what is left becomes a more concentrated red. Skin contact, or maceration, involves leaving the juice and its skins and pulp all mulched together for a time (hours, usually) so that some of the flavour and colour from the solid matter seeps into the wine.</p> <h2><strong>Ros\u00e9 should be cheap</strong></h2> <p>Ros\u00e9 certainly can be cheap, but anyone who has ever drunk vintage pink champagne knows that isn\u2019t always the case. In Provence, Sasha Lichine set out to create a really premium ros\u00e9 and succeeded: he sells millions of bottles of his Whispering Angel, at about \u00a318 each. That\u2019s his budget option: the gorgeous Les Clans won\u2019t leave you much change from \u00a350. Far from being the also-ran option for those without the know-how or the talent to make white or red, ros\u00e9 is \u201cthe most difficult colour I\u2019ve ever had to make good,\u201d says Lichine. Also costing about \u00a318 is Domaine Tempier ros\u00e9, from the prestigious Bandol appellation, which is credited with first showing the world how great ros\u00e9 can be. I have seen Domaine Tempier\u2019s co-founder Lulu Peyraud knock back a glass as if it were water, and she\u2019s 101 and counting. If Bandol ros\u00e9 holds the secret to eternal life, then \u00a318 seems pretty reasonable.</p> <h2><strong>The paler the pink, the better the wine</strong></h2> <p>Absolutely not. This myth probably arose because the wines of Provence, which range in colour from apricot to salmon, are so admired. And rightly so: when good, they are herbaceous and saline and dangerously drinkable. But colour isn\u2019t an indicator of quality \u2013 in fact, as pale ros\u00e9 has become more popular, some winemakers have prioritised shade to such an extent they have ended up with a kind of alcoholic water.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jul/18/think-pink-how-rose-became-the-booze-of-choice-for-millennials\">Think pink! How ros\u00e9 became the booze of choice for millennials</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>All ros\u00e9 is sweet</strong></h2> <p>Ugh, no. You\u2019re probably thinking of Mateus ros\u00e9. Or zinfandel blush. The former is a bubblegum-pink Portuguese wine that was hugely popular in the 1970s and 80s \u2013 around the same time as the Austrians were getting into trouble for sweetening their wine with antifreeze. Anything would taste good after that. Zinfandel blush is an American wine originally made by the Sutter Home winery in California but best known here for the bright pink Blossom Hill version. The best ros\u00e9, such as Chivite\u2019s Las Fincas Rosado, is dry and aromatic and elegant; it goes beautifully with food. It is also rather nice without food.</p> <h2><strong>You should only drink it in </strong><strong>summer</strong><br></h2> <p>Ros\u00e9 certainly goes well with sunshine \u2013 and the Proven\u00e7al kind makes a marvellous combination with tomato salads, artichokes or other summer delicacies. But I drink ros\u00e9 all year round, and it brings a little summer glint to grey winter days.</p> <h2><strong>It\u2019s only for aperitifs</strong><br></h2> <p>There are wondrous ros\u00e9 aperitifs; they are so wondrous you can keep drinking them throughout the meal. The only wine aperitifs that don\u2019t work with food are those, such as muscadet, that are too delicate to compete with any strong flavours. This is not how good ros\u00e9 does business.</p> <h2><strong>It\u2019s only for women </strong><br></h2> <p>Anyone who divides the contents of their bar along gender lines deserves to be consigned to drink water for ever. Good ros\u00e9 is for people who like good wine. If you are of legal drinking age and in possession of a couple of tastebuds, it is for you.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/14/cult-additive-free-natural-wine\">The cult of natural wine \u2013 'this is like punk or acid house'</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>It\u2019s only made in the south of France </strong><br></h2> <p>Oooh, no. These days, ros\u00e9 is made almost everywhere, from South Africa to Australia, and most countries can thrust forward some good examples, although France makes more \u2013 and more of the best \u2013 than anywhere else. But French ros\u00e9 spreads far beyond Provence. There are ros\u00e9s d\u2019Anjou in the Loire, and wonderful pink pinots (such as those made by Sylvain Pataille as Fleur de Pinot) in Burgundy. One of my all-time favourite ros\u00e9 regions (and it is an appellation, highly unusually, that only applies to ros\u00e9) is Tavel, a delicious, raspberry-coloured (and raspberry-flavoured) wine from the eponymous village in the southern Rh\u00f4ne \u2013 just across the river from Ch\u00e2teauneuf du Pape. (They don\u2019t make ros\u00e9, although one of the most famous CDP producers, the Perrin family, produces the excellent and phenomenally successful Miraval, better known as Brangelina\u2019s wine.)

      "bodyText": "Red wine gives you headaches; white wine tastes of nothing, unless it\u2019s sauvignon blanc; all Aussie wines are fruit bombs; the world will end if the flow of prosecco falters \u2013 the world of wine is full of ridiculous prejudices. Yet no style gets discriminated against quite like ros\u00e9. It\u2019s all sweet, we\u2019re told, or it\u2019s only for women, or for summer, or for women in summer \u2026 For a long time, ros\u00e9 was disregarded because good winemakers didn\u2019t make it: star California winemaker Rajat Parr, who was a San Francisco sommelier in the 1990s, once said: \u201cNo one cared about it, no one thought about it, no one drank it.\u201d That, thank goodness, has changed \u2013 yet the prejudices remain. So let\u2019s bust a few persistent myths. Ros\u00e9 is a new trend The ancients were probably drinking pink when Julius Caesar was knee-high to a grasshopper. In ancient Greece and Rome, white and red grapes would often have been crushed together, by foot, and the contact of the juice with red grapeskins would have meant that most wine was some version of red. Since the rules of classical civilisation held that all wine must be diluted with water \u2013 only barbarians drank it straight \u2013 a lot of that juice would have wound up a shade of pink. You make ros\u00e9 by blending red and white wine In ancient times, essentially yes, since, as noted, all the grapes were mixed together. These days we do things a little differently. There are two ways to make ros\u00e9 now: the saign\u00e9e method and skin contact. The former involves bleeding off some juice after red grapes have been pressed: that juice becomes a lightly tinted wine, while what is left becomes a more concentrated red. Skin contact, or maceration, involves leaving the juice and its skins and pulp all mulched together for a time (hours, usually) so that some of the flavour and colour from the solid matter seeps into the wine. Ros\u00e9 should be cheap Ros\u00e9 certainly can be cheap, but anyone who has ever drunk vintage pink champagne knows that isn\u2019t always the case. In Provence, Sasha Lichine set out to create a really premium ros\u00e9 and succeeded: he sells millions of bottles of his Whispering Angel, at about \u00a318 each. That\u2019s his budget option: the gorgeous Les Clans won\u2019t leave you much change from \u00a350. Far from being the also-ran option for those without the know-how or the talent to make white or red, ros\u00e9 is \u201cthe most difficult colour I\u2019ve ever had to make good,\u201d says Lichine. Also costing about \u00a318 is Domaine Tempier ros\u00e9, from the prestigious Bandol appellation, which is credited with first showing the world how great ros\u00e9 can be. I have seen Domaine Tempier\u2019s co-founder Lulu Peyraud knock back a glass as if it were water, and she\u2019s 101 and counting. If Bandol ros\u00e9 holds the secret to eternal life, then \u00a318 seems pretty reasonable. The paler the pink, the better the wine Absolutely not. This myth probably arose because the wines of Provence, which range in colour from apricot to salmon, are so admired. And rightly so: when good, they are herbaceous and saline and dangerously drinkable. But colour isn\u2019t an indicator of quality \u2013 in fact, as pale ros\u00e9 has become more popular, some winemakers have prioritised shade to such an extent they have ended up with a kind of alcoholic water. All ros\u00e9 is sweet Ugh, no. You\u2019re probably thinking of Mateus ros\u00e9. Or zinfandel blush. The former is a bubblegum-pink Portuguese wine that was hugely popular in the 1970s and 80s \u2013 around the same time as the Austrians were getting into trouble for sweetening their wine with antifreeze. Anything would taste good after that. Zinfandel blush is an American wine originally made by the Sutter Home winery in California but best known here for the bright pink Blossom Hill version. The best ros\u00e9, such as Chivite\u2019s Las Fincas Rosado, is dry and aromatic and elegant; it goes beautifully with food. It is also rather nice without food. You should only drink it in summer Ros\u00e9 certainly goes well with sunshine \u2013 and the Proven\u00e7al kind makes a marvellous combination with tomato salads, artichokes or other summer delicacies. But I drink ros\u00e9 all year round, and it brings a little summer glint to grey winter days. It\u2019s only for aperitifs There are wondrous ros\u00e9 aperitifs; they are so wondrous you can keep drinking them throughout the meal. The only wine aperitifs that don\u2019t work with food are those, such as muscadet, that are too delicate to compete with any strong flavours. This is not how good ros\u00e9 does business. It\u2019s only for women Anyone who divides the contents of their bar along gender lines deserves to be consigned to drink water for ever. Good ros\u00e9 is for people who like good wine. If you are of legal drinking age and in possession of a couple of tastebuds, it is for you. It\u2019s only made in the south of France Oooh, no. These days, ros\u00e9 is made almost everywhere, from South Africa to Australia, and most countries can thrust forward some good examples, although France makes more \u2013 and more of the best \u2013 than anywhere else. But French ros\u00e9 spreads far beyond Provence. There are ros\u00e9s d\u2019Anjou in the Loire, and wonderful pink pinots (such as those made by Sylvain Pataille as Fleur de Pinot) in Burgundy. One of my all-time favourite ros\u00e9 regions (and it is an appellation, highly unusually, that only applies to ros\u00e9) is Tavel, a delicious, raspberry-coloured (and raspberry-flavoured) wine from the eponymous village in the southern Rh\u00f4ne \u2013 just across the river from Ch\u00e2teauneuf du Pape. (They don\u2019t make ros\u00e9, although one of the most famous CDP producers, the Perrin family, produces the excellent and phenomenally successful Miraval, better known as Brangelina\u2019s wine.) Good tavel is fabulous; mediocre tavel is living off the wine\u2019s centuries of glory, when Louis XIV graced it with his favour and Balzac, the world\u2019s most caffeinated writer, would put down his beloved coffee cup for a glass of it. As recently as last century, the great gourmand AJ Liebling declared it the only ros\u00e9 worth drinking. Try Domaine de la Mordor\u00e9e and you may come to agree with him. It is less complicated than red or white wine I would like to say yes to this one \u2013 but it\u2019s probably, not, no. You can make it from many different grapes, although grenache is the most widely acceptable. You can make it in different ways, as we have seen. You can create a blush style or a rich red, and you can make red grapes in a white wine manner and name it Gris de Gris, as Ksara does in Lebanon, or make a white from your pinot grapes, which will often turn out pink, as Albourne does in West Sussex.",

However, the relevant minister ultimately decided I should not be appointed because of my social media activity. I submitted a subject access request to the Home Office \u2013 and the results were pretty shocking.</p> <p>It turned out that the reason my application had been rejected was that the secretariat of the advisory panel had flagged some tweets I had posted that were critical of government policy. Nearly 10,000 people have died from heroin-related causes in England, Wales and Scotland since 2010. There is currently an <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/217/12/1875/4931169\" title=\"\">HIV outbreak among people who inject drugs in Glasgow</a>. But in 2018 Victoria Atkins, the drugs minister, wrote a letter to the ACMD rejecting its call for the introduction of drug consumption rooms (DCRs) in the UK to tackle this crisis.</p> <p>In a tweet, I described the letter as \u201cutter BS\u201d and that it was \u201cmaking s**t up\u201d. I stand by those comments and the anger that propelled me to write them: people in this country are dying because drug policies are in desperate need of reform. In her letter, Atkins said the government had no intention of introducing DCRs, despite the strong evidence that they save lives.</p> <p>A DCR is a legally sanctioned facility where people who inject drugs can do so under medical supervision, plus they reverse overdoses, thus saving lives and providing people with much needed medical care. There are currently 11 countries successfully operating 117 such facilities around the world. Yet in her letter Atkins ignores this, choosing instead to misinform the public with the idea that DCRs are \u201clegally problematic, pose ethical issues for medical professionals and difficulties for law enforcement\u201d. The letter also inaccurately presents evidence from other countries that have implemented DCRs, something that the minister had previously done in parliament.</p> <p>I would never have thought that my social media activity would be used to block me from joining the ACMD \u2013 especially since I have also publicly supported the recommendations the ACMD has made about DCRs.

      "bodyText": "Last year, I applied to join the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, which advises the government on drug policy. I thought I could bring expertise on the impact of policing on people of colour, on harm reduction and on legal alternatives to the criminalisation of drug users \u2013 all of which I have written extensively on \u2013 and the fact that I work directly with people who have a history of problematic drug use. But last October, I was notified by the Home Office that my application had been unsuccessful. In the feedback provided, I was told that the interview panel considered me to be \u201cappointable\u201d and I was described as having \u201cimpressive expertise\u201d. However, the relevant minister ultimately decided I should not be appointed because of my social media activity. I submitted a subject access request to the Home Office \u2013 and the results were pretty shocking. It turned out that the reason my application had been rejected was that the secretariat of the advisory panel had flagged some tweets I had posted that were critical of government policy. Nearly 10,000 people have died from heroin-related causes in England, Wales and Scotland since 2010. There is currently an HIV outbreak among people who inject drugs in Glasgow. But in 2018 Victoria Atkins, the drugs minister, wrote a letter to the ACMD rejecting its call for the introduction of drug consumption rooms (DCRs) in the UK to tackle this crisis. In a tweet, I described the letter as \u201cutter BS\u201d and that it was \u201cmaking s**t up\u201d. I stand by those comments and the anger that propelled me to write them: people in this country are dying because drug policies are in desperate need of reform. In her letter, Atkins said the government had no intention of introducing DCRs, despite the strong evidence that they save lives. A DCR is a legally sanctioned facility where people who inject drugs can do so under medical supervision, plus they reverse overdoses, thus saving lives and providing people with much needed medical care. There are currently 11 countries successfully operating 117 such facilities around the world. Yet in her letter Atkins ignores this, choosing instead to misinform the public with the idea that DCRs are \u201clegally problematic, pose ethical issues for medical professionals and difficulties for law enforcement\u201d. The letter also inaccurately presents evidence from other countries that have implemented DCRs, something that the minister had previously done in parliament. I would never have thought that my social media activity would be used to block me from joining the ACMD \u2013 especially since I have also publicly supported the recommendations the ACMD has made about DCRs. But what is considerably more shocking to me is that these \u201cdue diligence\u201d assessments included checks on what I\u2019d said on Brexit and Windrush. I had only tweeted about the latter to highlight the important work that had been done by Guardian journalists in exposing the scandal. It appears from my case that government departments are routinely screening what candidates for independent advisory groups have said on topics that go way beyond the specific policy areas in which they are involved, which is in my opinion a deeply concerning overreach by ministers. Independent expert advice \u2013 even if that expert disagrees with government policy \u2013 is fundamental to the development of evidence-based policy. The fact that broader political views, especially on issues deemed contentious by government, seem to be being taken into consideration is frankly Orwellian. The Home Office stated the \u201clanguage and tone used [in my social media activity] identifies a concern that the candidate would find it hard to work alongside government\u201d. Yet Conservative leadership candidates have used language that is not only of concern, but is downright discriminatory and offensive. And the hypocrisy doesn\u2019t stop there. Out of the eight leadership contenders who have admitted they have used controlled substances, all have expressed regret and some have doubled down on punitive strategies to criminalise people who use drugs. Yet none have acknowledged that our punitive approach to drugs did not deter them from using controlled substances, nor suggested the need for reform. Our drug laws target the young, those living in poverty and people of colour; black people are 12 times more likely to be sentenced for cannabis possession offences than their white counterparts, despite using the drug at a lower rate. Last year in England and Wales, 35,594 people, with 41% of them under 24 years old, were criminalised for the same activity that many of these politicians described as youthful indiscretions.

In 2018 Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld disappeared as a result.</p>\n    <p>In terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. The likes of Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices.

Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What help do retailers need?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Retailers with a high-street presence want the government to change business rates. They also want more political certainty as the potential for a no deal Brexit means some are not only incurring additional costs for stockpiling goods but are unsure about the impact of tariffs after October 2019. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges which they say put off shoppers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the government doing?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In the October 2018 budget the government announced&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/26/budget-to-offer-business-rates-relief-for-small-shops\">some relief</a>&nbsp;on business rates for independent shopkeepers. It has also set up a \u00a3675m \u2018future high streets\u2019 fund under which local councils can bid for up to \u00a325m towards regeneration projects such as refurbishing local historic buildings and improving transport links. The fund will also pay for the creation of a high street taskforce to provide expertise and hands-on support to local areas.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the outlook in 2019?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Some retailers could go under. Weakened by a difficult Christmas \u2013 which accounts for the entire annual profits of many retailers, and with further Brexit wobbles to come \u2013 retailers are facing a tough 2019. Another rise in the national minimum wage in April and the falling value of the pound against the dollar, which is used to buy goods in the far east, have also added to costs and hit profits.</p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Green, who was long known as the king of the high street, has faced a barrage of criticism in recent years for pursuing a lavish lifestyle on his yacht in Monaco while his retail empire struggled.

      "body": "<p>The good news for Argentina is that Conmebol have handily arranged another Copa Am\u00e9rica for next year, one they will co-host with Colombia, so the thought that this year\u2019s Copa might be Lionel Messi\u2019s last chance to win a senior international tournament has already been defused. The bad news is that no matter how many new tournaments keep on being invented, it\u2019s now 26 years since Argentina won any of them and it seems increasingly likely that the golden production line that brought five Under-20 World Cups in seven tournaments between 1995 and 2007 and Olympic gold in 2004 and 2008 will remain forever unfulfilled.</p> <p>Argentina\u2019s preparations have been typically chaotic, almost as though they\u2019re still stunned by what happened at the World Cup when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/30/france-argentina-world-cup-last-16-match-report\">they were beaten 4-3 by France</a> after a fraught group stage from which they only qualified via the implausible medium of a late goal in their final game from Marcos Rojo. When the best laid plans go awry so often, the thinking seems to be, why bother laying them at all?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/these-football-times/2019/jun/12/copa-america-japan-qatar-strange-history-guest-teams\">Japan, Qatar and the history of guest teams at the Copa Am\u00e9rica</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The pressure of the job reduced the manager Jorge Sampaoli to a sickly, sweating wreck. He clearly had to go but working out who could replace him was rather trickier. Having appointed one of his backroom staff, Lionel Scaloni, as caretaker, the Argentinian Football Association ended up confirming the former West Ham full-back in the role until the end of this Copa Am\u00e9rica.</p> <p>C\u00e9sar Luis Menotti, who led Argentina to the World Cup in 1978, was installed as technical director to at least add a gloss of success but his main contribution so far has been to suggest the squad for the tournament should largely be drawn from those playing in the Argentinian league. That admittedly worked for him in 1978 when the junta prevented anybody but Mario Kempes from leaving but it seemed an eccentric plan given the economics of 2019 and has been understandably ignored.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"37fcc70709004c7a1ee687cdf78e7165230977b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37fcc70709004c7a1ee687cdf78e7165230977b9/0_41_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richarlison has been Brazil\u2019s most dangerous player in recent games\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richarlison has been Brazil\u2019s most dangerous player in recent games.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Diego Vara/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The favourites are probably Brazil, who have won all four of the previous Copas Am\u00e9rica they\u2019ve hosted. They\u2019ve won nine and drawn one of their 10 games since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/06/brazil-belgium-world-cup-quarter-final-match-report\">their World Cup quarter-final exit against Belgium</a> but it would be misleading to say there\u2019s any great sense of confidence or serenity about the squad. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/06/neymar-brazil-copa-america-ankle-injury-football\">Neymar will miss the tournament</a> after sustaining an ankle injury in a friendly against Qatar but,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/07/nike-very-concerned-about-claim-against-neymar-which-he-denies\"> given he is facing rape allegations</a>, the absence of him, his circus and the distractions they bring may make it easier for the team to focus.</p> <p>With Gabriel Jesus out of sorts and Roberto Firmino still recovering fitness, there is an issue at centre-forward and in recent games the most threatening presence in the box has been Richarlison dipping in from the right. Midfield is an issue as well: Belgium showed in the World Cup how they could be overrun and the Czech Republic did much the same to them in the first half of a friendly in March, prompting the coach Tite to bring Everton on for Lucas Paquet\u00e1 to offer support to Casemiro, shifting shape from his beloved 4-1-4-1 to 4-2-3-1.</p> <p>Uruguay are perhaps the most likely challengers to Brazil, although they are sweating on the fitness of Luis Su\u00e1rez. Their strength these days, beyond the sense of collective identity conjured by their 72-year-old coach \u00d3scar Tab\u00e1rez, is the burgeoning midfield of Rodrigo Bentancur, Mat\u00edas Vecino and Lucas Torreira, sandwiched by an experienced defence and forward line looking to give it one last (or second-last, given the additional tournament next year) push.</p> <p>This will be Colombia\u2019s first tournament under Carlos Queiroz after Jos\u00e9 Pekerman\u2019s six years in the job. Three friendlies under the former Real Madrid and Iran manager have brought mixed results and it\u2019s not at all clear how Colombia\u2019s more explosive talents will be accommodated in his characteristic patient passing style.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After their successes in the last two Copas, this Chile look tired, their great generation having run out of steam to the extent that they failed even to qualify for the World Cup. Beyond the obvious big four, the greatest interest perhaps lies in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/these-football-times/2019/jun/12/copa-america-japan-qatar-strange-history-guest-teams\">one of the two invitees</a>, Qatar (the other being Japan). <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/01/qatar-stun-japan-with-3-1-win-to-be-crowned-asian-cup-champions\">They won the Asian Cup in impressive style</a> earlier in the year and as they prepare to host the World Cup in 2022 this is an opportunity to test themselves in unfamiliar conditions against very different opponents. They\u2019ve been a little unfortunate with the draw, though, being grouped with Argentina and Colombia as well as a Paraguay side in chaos. Looking for a change to a more progressive approach, they appointed Juan Carlos Osorio last September but he left by mutual consent in February to be replaced by Eduardo Berizzo, who enjoyed great success as Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s assistant with Chile.</p> <p>Beyond that, there\u2019s Peru\u2019s attempts to squeeze one last drop of energy from the 35 year-old striker Paolo Guerrero and perhaps the greatest human story of the tournament as Venezuela play against the backdrop of ongoing political turmoil back home.</p> <p>A sense of mischief, perhaps, demands that Messi should finally break his international duck in the Maracan\u00e3, where he suffered such disappointment five years ago, but Brazil are strong favourites. The 2014 World Cup, though, showed the pressure they can feel as hosts and with plenty of tensions within the squad, this perhaps is an opportunity for Colombia if they can adjust to Queiroz\u2019s dictats or for Tab\u00e1rez to recreate the World Cup victory Uruguay implausibly pulled off in Rio three years after he was born.</p>",

The bad news is that no matter how many new tournaments keep on being invented, it\u2019s now 26 years since Argentina won any of them and it seems increasingly likely that the golden production line that brought five Under-20 World Cups in seven tournaments between 1995 and 2007 and Olympic gold in 2004 and 2008 will remain forever unfulfilled. Argentina\u2019s preparations have been typically chaotic, almost as though they\u2019re still stunned by what happened at the World Cup when they were beaten 4-3 by France after a fraught group stage from which they only qualified via the implausible medium of a late goal in their final game from Marcos Rojo. When the best laid plans go awry so often, the thinking seems to be, why bother laying them at all? The pressure of the job reduced the manager Jorge Sampaoli to a sickly, sweating wreck. He clearly had to go but working out who could replace him was rather trickier. Having appointed one of his backroom staff, Lionel Scaloni, as caretaker, the Argentinian Football Association ended up confirming the former West Ham full-back in the role until the end of this Copa Am\u00e9rica. C\u00e9sar Luis Menotti, who led Argentina to the World Cup in 1978, was installed as technical director to at least add a gloss of success but his main contribution so far has been to suggest the squad for the tournament should largely be drawn from those playing in the Argentinian league. That admittedly worked for him in 1978 when the junta prevented anybody but Mario Kempes from leaving but it seemed an eccentric plan given the economics of 2019 and has been understandably ignored. The favourites are probably Brazil, who have won all four of the previous Copas Am\u00e9rica they\u2019ve hosted. They\u2019ve won nine and drawn one of their 10 games since their World Cup quarter-final exit against Belgium but it would be misleading to say there\u2019s any great sense of confidence or serenity about the squad. Neymar will miss the tournament after sustaining an ankle injury in a friendly against Qatar but, given he is facing rape allegations, the absence of him, his circus and the distractions they bring may make it easier for the team to focus. With Gabriel Jesus out of sorts and Roberto Firmino still recovering fitness, there is an issue at centre-forward and in recent games the most threatening presence in the box has been Richarlison dipping in from the right. Midfield is an issue as well: Belgium showed in the World Cup how they could be overrun and the Czech Republic did much the same to them in the first half of a friendly in March, prompting the coach Tite to bring Everton on for Lucas Paquet\u00e1 to offer support to Casemiro, shifting shape from his beloved 4-1-4-1 to 4-2-3-1. Uruguay are perhaps the most likely challengers to Brazil, although they are sweating on the fitness of Luis Su\u00e1rez. Their strength these days, beyond the sense of collective identity conjured by their 72-year-old coach \u00d3scar Tab\u00e1rez, is the burgeoning midfield of Rodrigo Bentancur, Mat\u00edas Vecino and Lucas Torreira, sandwiched by an experienced defence and forward line looking to give it one last (or second-last, given the additional tournament next year) push. This will be Colombia\u2019s first tournament under Carlos Queiroz after Jos\u00e9 Pekerman\u2019s six years in the job. Three friendlies under the former Real Madrid and Iran manager have brought mixed results and it\u2019s not at all clear how Colombia\u2019s more explosive talents will be accommodated in his characteristic patient passing style. After their successes in the last two Copas, this Chile look tired, their great generation having run out of steam to the extent that they failed even to qualify for the World Cup. Beyond the obvious big four, the greatest interest perhaps lies in one of the two invitees, Qatar (the other being Japan). They won the Asian Cup in impressive style earlier in the year and as they prepare to host the World Cup in 2022 this is an opportunity to test themselves in unfamiliar conditions against very different opponents. They\u2019ve been a little unfortunate with the draw, though, being grouped with Argentina and Colombia as well as a Paraguay side in chaos. Looking for a change to a more progressive approach, they appointed Juan Carlos Osorio last September but he left by mutual consent in February to be replaced by Eduardo Berizzo, who enjoyed great success as Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s assistant with Chile. Beyond that, there\u2019s Peru\u2019s attempts to squeeze one last drop of energy from the 35 year-old striker Paolo Guerrero and perhaps the greatest human story of the tournament as Venezuela play against the backdrop of ongoing political turmoil back home. A sense of mischief, perhaps, demands that Messi should finally break his international duck in the Maracan\u00e3, where he suffered such disappointment five years ago, but Brazil are strong favourites. The 2014 World Cup, though, showed the pressure they can feel as hosts and with plenty of tensions within the squad, this perhaps is an opportunity for Colombia if they can adjust to Queiroz\u2019s dictats or for Tab\u00e1rez to recreate the World Cup victory Uruguay implausibly pulled off in Rio three years after he was born.",

President stokes controversy ahead of re-election campaign Donald Trump, days before he is due to launch his 2020 re-election campaign, has said he would \u201cwant to hear\u201d dirt on his opponent if it was offered by a foreign power. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with listening,\u201d the president told ABC News on Wednesday, reigniting the controversy over his 2016 campaign\u2019s contacts with Russia, and provoking several Democratic presidential candidates to call once again for his impeachment. \u2018Fake polling\u2019. Trump lashed out on Wednesday at new poll results that suggested his re-election was in doubt, with six Democrats polling ahead of him nationally and his campaign\u2019s internal polling reportedly showing weakness in 17 states. 2020 foresight. As Bernie Sanders laid out his democratic socialist vision for the US, we assess where the Democratic contenders stand on key issues ahead of the 2020 primaries. Two oil tankers struck by suspected attacks in Gulf of Oman Two oil tankers have been hit in suspected attacks in the Gulf of Oman, amid ongoing tensions in the region between the US and Iran. The suspected attacks, close to the strategic Strait of Hormuz, come weeks after blasts rocked four other tankers docked off the coast of the UAE. Iran has repeatedly denied involvement in those attacks, despite claims to the contrary by the US national security adviser, John Bolton. Oil price. News of the attacks sent the price of oil surging early on Thursday, with Brent crude jumping more than 3% to $62 per barrel. House panel holds Barr and Ross in contempt over census The House oversight committee has voted to hold the US attorney general, William Barr, and the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, in contempt of Congress for their refusal to turn over documents regarding changes to the US census. The White House has pushed to include a question about US citizenship on the 2020 census, and then asserted executive privilege over documents that could shed light on the motives behind that decision. Citizenship question. It has been revealed that the late GOP consultant Thomas Hofeller studied the effect of the citizenship question and found that its inclusion in the census would be \u201cadvantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic whites\u201d. Hong Kong falls silent as world backs protesters The streets of Hong Kong were largely quiet on Thursday after the government delayed its planned debate on the controversial extradition bill, which had led to Wednesday\u2019s widespread strikes and mass protests. Police responded with teargas and rubber bullets to what Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, claimed was a \u201cblatant riot\u201d, but the European Union said the rights of the territories\u2019 citizens to protest \u201cneed to be protected\u201d, while Trump told reporters he \u201c[understood] the reason for the demonstration\u201d. Beijing\u2019s backing. The US president said he believed Hong Kong could \u201cwork it out\u201d with China, which is backing the extradition law that would allow Beijing to pursue its political opponents in the former British colony. Crib sheet The British home secretary says he has signed a request for Julian Assange to be extradited to the US to face computer hacking charges, pending a court hearing on his case. The California police officers who killed Willie McCoy while he was sleeping in his car at a Taco Bell in Vallejo in February fired 55 rounds at the 20-year-old rapper, a level of deadly force described as \u201creasonable\u201d by the city\u2019s hired consultant. The US military creates more planet-warming emissions than some industrialised countries, including Portugal and Sweden, according to a study, which found the Pentagon produced about 59m metric tons of greenhouse gases in 2017. Mexico\u2019s culture minister has accused the Venezuelan designer Carolina Herrera of cultural appropriation, after her company used indigenous Mexican designs in its latest fashion line. Must-reads Trump\u2019s military ban increases hostility to trans people Trump\u2019s ban on transgender people in the military took effect in April, forcing those who wish to enlist to disguise their gender identity. As Ed Pilkington reports, it has spread fear among about 15,000 active personnel, and emboldened hostility towards even those on the frontline. How the taste of home sustained my refugee parents In Bosnia, Aleksandar Hemon\u2019s parents had a social life that revolved around eating and drinking. Their central bonding ritual was spit-roasting a lamb to be shared among friends and family. Ever since they relocated to Canada as refugees in 1993, the flavours of their old home have kept them connected to the past. What does it mean to be genetically Jewish? In Israel, DNA tests have been used to verify a person\u2019s Jewishness. Oscar Schwartz asks whether it is wise to try to prove religious or cultural identity scientifically, when authorities around the world are beginning to use DNA to categorise and discriminate against groups of people. \u2018Long overdue\u2019 exhibition of Native American female artists The Minneapolis Institute of Art\u2019s groundbreaking retrospective of artworks by Native American and Canadian women is the first ever museum exhibition to showcase such artists, many of whom remain anonymous. It is \u201ccorrective art history\u201d, writes Nadja Sayej. Opinion Trump is set to award the presidential medal of freedom to Art Laffer, the \u201cgodfather of Reaganomics\u201d. Why, asks Morris Pearl, are conservatives still pretending that Laffer\u2019s supply-side theory holds water? Laffer\u2019s theory just so happens to serve as the basis for every terrible tax cut that Trump and the Republican party have passed for decades. Sport The St Louis Blues beat the Bruins 4-1 in Game 7 of the Stanley Cup final in Boston on Wednesday night, thus claiming their first ever NHL championship.

The \u201cBasic Law\u201d constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2003:&nbsp;</b>Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2007:&nbsp;</b>The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive\u2019s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong&nbsp;Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2014:&nbsp;</b>The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of \u201cfake universal suffrage\u201d and \u201cfake democracy\u201d. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015,&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party\u2019s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2019:&nbsp;</b>Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/hong-kong-lam-to-withdraw-extradition-bill-say-reports\">Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In Tamar Park, another group was organising stations for food and water, first aid, and legal advice from social workers. A group of secondary students had come directly from school to bring snacks and fruit to the protesters, who planned to stay there until midnight. Some would camp overnight to keep watch over the supplies.</p> \n<p>Some worried that the postponement of the debate was a ruse to throw off demonstrators. A group of university students huddled in a shopping mall near the government buildings, texting contacts to mobilise a group to gather outside the Legislative Council and block any lawmakers in favour of the bill from entering.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur only chance is to stop the lawmakers from coming in,\u201d said Jason Fong, 19, who said lawmakers could go in on Thursday, stay overnight and hold the reading of the bill on Friday.</p> \n<p>The crackdown on the protests represented an escalation of police action against demonstrators. Pictures and videos on social media showed police firing rubber bullets and bean-bag rounds from shotguns, teargassing protesters and beating some with batons.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f831c653-b405-4d43-b7eb-8fd78acc2c5a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SM_JZ9kasB0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Man-kei Tam, the director of Amnesty International Hong Kong, said: \u201cThis excessive response from police is fuelling tensions and is likely to contribute to worsening violence, rather than end it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Two protesters treated in hospital were arrested, according to local media.

Speaking on Wednesday evening, Lam said: \u201cIf I let him have his way every time my son acted like that, such as when he didn\u2019t want to study, things might be OK between us in the short term.

In Tamar Park, outside the Legislative Council building where lawmakers will debate the proposed bill, a circle of demonstrators were singing worship songs accompanied by a saxophonist. Others were more defiant. A few dozen protesters on an overpass leading into the government complex faced off with police blocking their way. The group stood in silence, holding up laminated signs that said \u201cRetract\u201d and \u201cGo Hong Kong\u201d. Later in the day a new group arrived and held signs that said \u201cStop police brutality\u201d. Secondary school students held signs up to the police that said \u201cStop shooting Hong Kong students\u201d. One group of protesters chanted: \u201cStop all violence. Peace and love come to Hong Kong.\u201d Mike Tsang, 23, a recent graduate, said: \u201cWe are coming here to show the police we won\u2019t give up.\u201d Nearby another group was sorting bags of helmets, face masks and other supplies, and trying to find places around the city to hide the items for when the protesters return. \u201cToday we are safe,\u201d said one of the protesters. In Tamar Park, another group was organising stations for food and water, first aid, and legal advice from social workers. A group of secondary students had come directly from school to bring snacks and fruit to the protesters, who planned to stay there until midnight. Some would camp overnight to keep watch over the supplies. Some worried that the postponement of the debate was a ruse to throw off demonstrators. A group of university students huddled in a shopping mall near the government buildings, texting contacts to mobilise a group to gather outside the Legislative Council and block any lawmakers in favour of the bill from entering. \u201cOur only chance is to stop the lawmakers from coming in,\u201d said Jason Fong, 19, who said lawmakers could go in on Thursday, stay overnight and hold the reading of the bill on Friday. The crackdown on the protests represented an escalation of police action against demonstrators. Pictures and videos on social media showed police firing rubber bullets and bean-bag rounds from shotguns, teargassing protesters and beating some with batons. Man-kei Tam, the director of Amnesty International Hong Kong, said: \u201cThis excessive response from police is fuelling tensions and is likely to contribute to worsening violence, rather than end it.\u201d Two protesters treated in hospital were arrested, according to local media. Protesters have been obscuring their faces with masks and using encrypted messaging platforms. On Wednesday as police were clearing protests, the messaging service Telegram posted on Twitter that it was facing a \u201cpowerful DDos attack\u201d, referring to a distributed denial of service attack, that originated in China. Despite the wave of opposition, Lam remains determined to put the bill to a vote, which would be likely to pass because of the dominance of pro-Beijing lawmakers in the legislature. Speaking on Wednesday evening, Lam said: \u201cIf I let him have his way every time my son acted like that, such as when he didn\u2019t want to study, things might be OK between us in the short term. But if I indulge his wayward behaviour, he might regret it when he grows up. He will then ask me: \u2018Mum, why didn\u2019t you call me up on that back then?\u2019\u201d she said. Lam has the support of Beijing. In an an English-language editorial, the state-run China Daily blamed \u201cthe opposition camp and its foreign masters\u201d for riling up residents. \u201cIt is lawlessness that will hurt Hong Kong, not the proposed amendments to its fugitive law,\u201d it said. The demonstrators disagree, pointing to the sense of community and collaboration fostered. Yau Wai Ping, an associate professor at Hong Kong Baptist University who was participating in a hunger strike, said: \u201cThe protest is bringing people together. The bill affects us all.\u201d She added: \u201cWe don\u2019t know whether we are going to achieve what we set out to, but long-term I am quite optimistic. So many positive things have come out of this. Long-term it will be the beginning of a new era, of the kind of community and civil society we want to make.\u201d",

People told us afterwards that that was one of the first times they had heard fans in the Azteca applaud the opposition.\u201d Mexican fans, who a year earlier had been wowed by Pele and Carlos Alberto, knew quality play when they saw it and were happy to show their appreciation.

Even for the first match [a 3-0 win over France in Guadalajara], there was something like 40,000 people in the stadium. And the atmosphere around the country was amazing. It was like, \u2018we\u2019ve had the Olympics and the men\u2019s World Cup, now here come the women so let\u2019s make a big party for them, too.\u2019 It was quite a new world. There was something in the papers about women\u2019s football every day and everywhere we went people wanted photographs and autographs. You could never just walk out to a shop because there were big crowds waiting for us around the hotel.\u201d</p> <p>Denmark had arrived as the No 1 team thanks to their victory in the inaugural edition of the tournament in Italy in 1970. But this was a very different team, as the side that had triumphed the previous year had been made up of players from one club, Boldklubben Femina. For the 1971 competition the Kvindelig Fodbold Union (Danish Women\u2019s Football Union, which was set up because the country\u2019s Uefa-backed union, the DBU, would not admit women), decided to form a truly national team.

They met again in their final group game, sharing a 1-1 draw that enabled both to progress to the semi-finals. Denmark trounced Argentina 5-0 but Italy were knocked out by the host nation.</p> <p>\u201cApparently they were very bad losers,\u201d says Kjems. \u201cThey had been very aggressive during the match and afterwards they smashed up mirrors and toilets in the dressing rooms and everything.\u201d Italy recovered their composure sufficiently to win the third-place playoff, while Denmark won the tournament \u2013 and the admiration of the Azteca crowd \u2013 with a 3-0 triumph over Mexico in the final. As a promotional gimmick, pink and white hoops had been painted on the goalpost for the tournament and all stadium staff wore pink uniforms. Naturally, then, there was only one way for the Danes to celebrate their victory. \u201cWe had a bath in pink champagne!\u201d recalls Kjems. \u201cI don\u2019t know where it came from, I didn\u2019t even know pink champagne existed, but there was lots of it after the final!\u201d</p> <p>Denmark flew home as the two-times world champions. \u201cOrdinary people were very excited but not the official men,\u201d says Kjems. \u201cOn the day we landed the head of the DBU [Vilhelm Skousen] said there would never be women members of the Danish Football Union during his lifetime.

The DBU did so in 1972. But only half-heartedly and in a way that undid much of the good development work women had done for themselves. \u201cThey said to us \u2018your tournament and national league is a no-go\u2019,\u201d says Kjems. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t take our system, instead it was \u2018You have to start from scratch, we have to see if you are really serious about playing football\u2019.

We were winning matches 9-0 so it was very boring, especially for me as a goalkeeper. And at the national team we were no longer allowed to play in unofficial tournaments, only against nations whose women\u2019s team had official status. So for years we could only really play against Nordic teams. I and other players lost some of our best football years because men insisted on doing things their way and weren\u2019t quick enough about it. So I think, even now, it is very important for women do stand up and do things for themselves. Don\u2019t wait for men to do it for you.\u201d</p> <p>The memory of Denmark\u2019s double world champions soon faded, even in their own country.

      "bodyText": "Is it mere coincidence that the longest-running big-screen superhero saga has finally been brought to its knees, just as events in Hollywood have conspired to ensure that it would have been finished pretty soon anyway? With Marvel waiting in the wings to take charge of the X-Men, following Disney\u2019s merger with 20th Century Fox, it is certainly pretty convenient for the mouse house that X-Men: Dark Phoenix\u2019s pitiful opening US weekend (a mere $33m) ensures this current iteration of the colourful mutants has finally been fed to the Sentinels. A sole outlier, the long-delayed, horror-themed The New Mutants, remains in the can and will probably not be seen until 2020, while Ryan Reynolds\u2019 Deadpool is likely to continue in trademark potty-mouthed form at Disney. But after 20 years, during which a dozen movies have been released, the adventure is pretty much over, and it is fair to say that the series will not be overly missed. The best instalments (Deadpool, Logan) have taken place largely outside the main continuum, while the renewed sci-fi energy that seemed to have been pumped into the core chronicle by 2014\u2019s cunningly crafted time travel adventure Days of Future Past has been completely lost during its two sequels. It goes without saying that the X-Men are missing the raw, brooding presence of Hugh Jackman\u2019s Wolverine. Quite why the opportunity was never taken to reintroduce the gnarled character in the current timeline (albeit with a new actor pulling on the adamantium claws) is open to question. Dark Phoenix compounds all the issues the core X-Men movies have had at their worst: the surfeit of characters that means we rarely get under the skin of any of them; the failure of the story to evolve beyond its key Magneto-Professor X dichotomy; the clunky inter-superhero romances.

Could cast and crew simply not be bothered to keep up their energy levels, like an office workplace before Christmas break? Apart from the always-reliable Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy, nobody seems to have made any effort to raise their game \u2013 though Simon Kinberg\u2019s tepid script and by-the-numbers direction (not to mention all those reshoots) can hardly have helped . When Matthew Vaughn semi-rebooted the saga with 2011\u2019s passable 60s-set X-Men: First Class, the series gained an engaging Watchmen-esque period veneer that continued with the 70s-set Days of Future Past. Dark Phoenix is ostensibly set in the 90s, but there is little to indicate this, not even a Captain Marvel-style visit to Blockbuster Video. Worse still, the movie has been afflicted by what British director Danny Boyle once referred to as the \u201cmoisturiser problem\u201d \u2013 namely that Fassbender, McAvoy and Nicholas Hoult look barely a day older than they did eight years ago, even though their characters are supposed to have aged 30 years since First Class.

      "bodyText": "Voting has formally opened to choose the next Conservative leader, and Theresa May\u2019s successor as prime minister, with Boris Johnson the clear favourite and four of the 10 candidates at risk of being eliminated in the first round of voting. The 313 Conservative MPs will be able to cast a single vote from 10am until midday with a result expected at around 1pm on Thursday. Successive rounds of MP voting will whittle down the candidates to a final two, who will be put to a vote of Tory members. Under revised rules to the contest, introduced because of the large field, to reach the next round of votes on Tuesday, candidates must secure at least 17 votes \u2013 themselves and 16 others \u2013 with several of them looking unlikely to do this. According to tallies of public declarations by MPs, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has just passed the threshold, but four other hopefuls are struggling: the former chief whip Mark Harper, who has eight public backers; the international development secretary, Rory Stewart, with seven; the ex-work and pensions secretary Esther McVey, on six; and the former Commons leader Andrea Leadsom, on four. Much could change in the voting, which is secret, given that more than 70 Conservative MPs have yet to declare their allegiance, but it would be a significant surprise if Johnson did not top the vote. In fact, it is possible that the former foreign secretary, who emerged from his recent media seclusion to formally launch his leadership campaign on Wednesday, could even reach the 105 MPs\u2019 votes needed to automatically be put in the run-off vote of members. If several candidates are removed in the first round of voting, the battle will be on for the other hopefuls to gain their backers. Under the rules, even if all 10 candidates get at least 17 votes, the candidate with the lowest number will be eliminated. In the next round on Thursday, the threshold to progress will be 33 votes, and again the lowest scorer will be gone if all achieve this. If needed, there will be further rounds of voting on Wednesday and Thursday next week, this time with no threshold, and with the candidate with the lowest number of votes eliminated each time. The final two will then participate in hustings and various TV events. The winner will be announced on 22 July. The race was sparked by May\u2019s decision last month to stand down after successive failures to get her Brexit deal passed by parliament. She formally made the step on Friday, thus setting the contest in motion.",

I can\u2019t prove that. But I\u2019ve been everywhere in the UK that is more idyllic than Lambeth \u2013 which is all of it, St Keverne to Pitlochry, Hunstanton to Anglesey \u2013 and I\u2019ve never met a kitchen knife sharper than David Davis. My friend\u2019s mum travels with a bread knife and an all-round kitchen slicer as a bare minimum, and everyone calls her Villanelle (before Killing Eve, they used to call her Scarface), until they\u2019re trying to make a tomato salad armed only with the art of persuasion. I would also, if I ever remembered, take a peeler: it is more common to find one that works but more troublesome if you don\u2019t.</p> <p>There\u2019s a level of uselessness that is actively insulting: the glass breadboard; the one-person cafetiere. There are items that would be innocuous as part of a well-stocked kitchenucopia \u2013 the fondue set, the Chinese basket steamer - which, in a place that doesn\u2019t have a bloody colander, look like a trolling operation. There\u2019s the world turned upside down \u2013 the electric hob with a gas oven. Hardly anyone really understands gas marks: they just stick everything on at six, for the very good reason that all gas marks are the same as six, except for eight, which is what you use to check the smoke alarm has batteries, and one, which is for farmers trying to resuscitate a barely-alive lamb. The electric hob, meanwhile \u2013 nothing\u2019s happening, no, still nothing, <em>help it\u2019s on fire</em> \u2013 is really fit only for boiling water.</p> <p>In a mysterious cupboard that you had assumed was the fusebox, you\u2019ll find everything essential: the corkscrew, the tin opener, the zester. (Ha! Only joking \u2013 you\u2019ll never find a zester.) In a large, well-placed cupboard that you would have used for core business \u2013 saucepans, sieves etc \u2013 you\u2019ll find stacks of bakeware you don\u2019t know how to use: it is not made of metal so you wouldn\u2019t want to use it for roasting or baking; often, it will have a decorative lemon painted on it with a high glaze, which may or may not be heatproof; or it\u2019s crenelated, or it\u2019s made of clay, or glass, and the only thing any of this was designed for is the thing that nobody makes \u2013 moussaka.</p> <p>In an eye-height cupboard that the rational world would use for cups and glasses, you\u2019ll find bad herbs: dried basil, powdered onion, Cajun mix. There\u2019s probably a make-your-own-cheese kit at the back. Do not make your own cheese. Looking for silver foil, you will eventually hit the miscellany drawer: honey spoons, sweetcorn stabbers, tiny good-for-nothing skewers, cocktail umbrellas, over-designed bottle openers, melon ballers. Immediately run towards your associates, shouting: \u201cI\u2019ve found cocktail umbrellas!\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s good to get other people on to alternative tasks, otherwise they\u2019ll be hovering by your elbow the whole time, going: \u201cBut why are you so angry?\u201d</p> <p>You\u2019ll never find a user-friendly set of scales, but you may eventually find one of those contraptions with weights labelled in the smallest imaginable writing, and then have to summon a child to ask which one says \u201c200g\u201d. Measuring implements generally \u2013 jugs, spoons, cups \u2013 will be in very short supply. The subliminal message of the entire self-catering world is: \u201cWho wants to spend their holiday measuring things?\u201d To which the answer is: \u201cPeople who want to eat things.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019d like to end on an upbeat note, floating some notion of the incredible resourcefulness embedded deep in all of us, and how you can astonish yourself crushing garlic with the heel of your hand. That is not true. The best thing about a stranger\u2019s kitchen is going back to your own kitchen.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In Switzerland, it is illegal to unload a stranger\u2019s dishwasher: it can be months before your vandalism has been made good and everything is where it belongs. No, sorry, that\u2019s wrong: in Switzerland it is illegal to keep one guinea pig without a cagemate. But the dishwasher thing should be illegal. The ordering of a kitchen is idiosyncratic and unguessable. There is no natural taxonomy to tell you where, for example, the grater should go (near the knives, or near the cheese?). There is no universally established list of things a kitchen should have, so that when you are away from home you can spend hours looking for a hand blender only to discover that these are considered, by unnatural people, to be non-essential, or give up after five minutes looking for a pestle and mortar, only to find a magnificent one of industrial size and high-quality stonework, stored on the third shelf behind the Tupperware. It doesn\u2019t usually matter, because you wouldn\u2019t cook in someone else\u2019s kitchen, unless you are related to them. Either that, or you have gone round to help a friend who is injured or has had a nervous breakdown, in which case, boil an egg. Prolonged exposure to a stranger\u2019s kitchen otherwise happens only on holiday, where it joins a constellation of stressors, including other people, and having been drunk since lunchtime. So that\u2019s something to look forward to this summer. British self-catering is the worst in the world. I can\u2019t prove that. But I\u2019ve been everywhere in the UK that is more idyllic than Lambeth \u2013 which is all of it, St Keverne to Pitlochry, Hunstanton to Anglesey \u2013 and I\u2019ve never met a kitchen knife sharper than David Davis. My friend\u2019s mum travels with a bread knife and an all-round kitchen slicer as a bare minimum, and everyone calls her Villanelle (before Killing Eve, they used to call her Scarface), until they\u2019re trying to make a tomato salad armed only with the art of persuasion. I would also, if I ever remembered, take a peeler: it is more common to find one that works but more troublesome if you don\u2019t. There\u2019s a level of uselessness that is actively insulting: the glass breadboard; the one-person cafetiere. There are items that would be innocuous as part of a well-stocked kitchenucopia \u2013 the fondue set, the Chinese basket steamer - which, in a place that doesn\u2019t have a bloody colander, look like a trolling operation. There\u2019s the world turned upside down \u2013 the electric hob with a gas oven. Hardly anyone really understands gas marks: they just stick everything on at six, for the very good reason that all gas marks are the same as six, except for eight, which is what you use to check the smoke alarm has batteries, and one, which is for farmers trying to resuscitate a barely-alive lamb. The electric hob, meanwhile \u2013 nothing\u2019s happening, no, still nothing, help it\u2019s on fire \u2013 is really fit only for boiling water. In a mysterious cupboard that you had assumed was the fusebox, you\u2019ll find everything essential: the corkscrew, the tin opener, the zester. (Ha! Only joking \u2013 you\u2019ll never find a zester.) In a large, well-placed cupboard that you would have used for core business \u2013 saucepans, sieves etc \u2013 you\u2019ll find stacks of bakeware you don\u2019t know how to use: it is not made of metal so you wouldn\u2019t want to use it for roasting or baking; often, it will have a decorative lemon painted on it with a high glaze, which may or may not be heatproof; or it\u2019s crenelated, or it\u2019s made of clay, or glass, and the only thing any of this was designed for is the thing that nobody makes \u2013 moussaka. In an eye-height cupboard that the rational world would use for cups and glasses, you\u2019ll find bad herbs: dried basil, powdered onion, Cajun mix. There\u2019s probably a make-your-own-cheese kit at the back. Do not make your own cheese. Looking for silver foil, you will eventually hit the miscellany drawer: honey spoons, sweetcorn stabbers, tiny good-for-nothing skewers, cocktail umbrellas, over-designed bottle openers, melon ballers. Immediately run towards your associates, shouting: \u201cI\u2019ve found cocktail umbrellas!\u201d It\u2019s good to get other people on to alternative tasks, otherwise they\u2019ll be hovering by your elbow the whole time, going: \u201cBut why are you so angry?\u201d You\u2019ll never find a user-friendly set of scales, but you may eventually find one of those contraptions with weights labelled in the smallest imaginable writing, and then have to summon a child to ask which one says \u201c200g\u201d. Measuring implements generally \u2013 jugs, spoons, cups \u2013 will be in very short supply. The subliminal message of the entire self-catering world is: \u201cWho wants to spend their holiday measuring things?\u201d To which the answer is: \u201cPeople who want to eat things.\u201d I\u2019d like to end on an upbeat note, floating some notion of the incredible resourcefulness embedded deep in all of us, and how you can astonish yourself crushing garlic with the heel of your hand. That is not true. The best thing about a stranger\u2019s kitchen is going back to your own kitchen.",

      "bodyText": "European newspapers have expressed horror at the prospect of Boris Johnson becoming the UK\u2019s next prime minister, describing him as a scandal-proof serial promise-breaker whose arrival at No 10 would be \u201ca calamity for his country and for Europe\u201d. Le Monde, in an excoriating editorial, said Johnson had shown himself to be \u201ca stranger to logic and convictions\u201d in a career rich in \u201cdeceits, blunders and failures\u201d. In the run-up to the 2016 referendum he \u201ctold lies on the side of a bus, promised the UK could have its cake and eat it, and compared the EU to the Third Reich,\u201d it said. As foreign secretary he \u201cmade his country an object of ridicule around the world with his amateurism, flippancy and ignorance\u201d, France\u2019s newspaper of record continued. Rivalling Nigel Farage for populism, Johnson\u2019s \u201cjingoistic rhetoric\u201d promised Britons an unrealistic \u201cglorious global future\u201d. His threat to withhold the \u20ac39bn Brexit divorce settlement would have \u201cincalculable consequences\u201d, damaging the international credibility of a country priding itself on being a champion of the rule of law, Le Monde said. And for the EU a Johnson premiership would mean \u201ca mini-Trump across the Channel, dedicated to its sabotage\u201d. Britain would become \u201ca hostile principality, built on social, fiscal and environmental deregulation.\u201d The Dutch daily newspaper de Volkskrant said Johnson\u2019s appeal was as a \u201cBrexit-believer, a 21st-century buccaneer, a pirate who surfs the oceans in search of wealth, unconstrained by rules or conventions\u201d. But it said there was good reason to think he \u201cbelieves rather more in himself than in Brexit\u201d. It said Johnson\u2019s main strength was that \u201cno scandal seems to stick, be it extramarital affairs, fraudulent statements, offensive utterances or an offer to help an old college friend attack a tabloid journalist.\u201d For the Tories he was \u201cthe joker in the card game that Brexit has become\u201d. Germany\u2019s Handelsblatt said Johnson would be \u201cfatal for Britain\u201d. If he succeeded Theresa May at the end of July, \u201cthe UK and the international partners of the fifth largest economy in the world are likely to encounter chaos\u201d. It said Johnson \u201chas never shied away from making bold promises, few of which he has ever kept\u201d. All the signs were that he would continue in this vein, it added, if only because \u201chis sole chance of becoming prime minister is if he meets the expectations of the Brexit hardliners\u201d. Handelsblatt predicted that in the battle for the Tory leadership, Johnson \u201cwill promise a lot \u2013 and ultimately prove unable to deliver \u2026 It is to be hoped that he will be beaten in the race for the premiership. Unfortunately, given Britain\u2019s current pro-Brexit mood, he may not be.\u201d Spain\u2019s El Pa\u00eds cautioned that \u201cthe only person capable of defeating Boris Johnson \u2013 and there are precedents \u2013 is Boris Johnson himself\u201d. The paper said Conservative Eurosceptics had plainly decided to \u201cignore the many doubts raised by the unpredictable personality of the former mayor of London\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Lidl is to launch its first store in central London as it opens 40 new shops across the capital in the next five years. The German discount chain said it would invest more than \u00a3500m in London and create 1,500 jobs at the new stores, at locations including Alperton, East Acton, Hackbridge and Watford. Lidl currently has 88 shops in the capital, out of 760 in the UK. Lidl will refurbish a Sainsbury\u2019s store on Tottenham Court Road near Warren Street tube station, its first shop in the heart of London. It is due to open next summer and will be a full-sized Lidl store with a 1,300m\u00b2 shop floor, selling its full range of products, including bread and cakes baked in-store and its popular middle-aisle items. These are non-food products that change frequently, from clothing and toys to kitchen appliances and garden tools. Christian H\u00e4rtnagel, chief executive officer of Lidl\u2019s UK arm, said: \u201cIt\u2019s coming up to 25 years since we first launched in London, and in that time we\u2019ve grown to almost 90 stores, employing more than 5,000 people. London is at the heart of our growth plans across Great Britain.\u201d Lidl has started building a new headquarters in Tolworth in south-west London to house 800 staff. It also plans a new warehouse in Luton and is expanding its Belvedere warehouse which delivers to its stores in south London. George Charles, of the MoneySavingHeroes website, said: \u201cOne of the worst parts of living in London is the sheer cost of everything, including groceries, as many are forced to shop in expensive convenience stores that are dotted around the city. This planned expansion by Lidl will hopefully make a small difference, giving those living close to the stores a chance at a more affordable life whilst in London.\u201d Lidl moved into the UK market in 1994 and now employs more than 22,500 people in its stores chain and 13 warehouses. British shoppers continue to flock to Lidl and its German rival Aldi, which rang up the biggest sales increases in the year to April, according to figures from consultancy Kantar. Both have transformed the way Britain shops, and Lidl now controls 5.7% of the UK grocery market, ahead of Waitrose. In recent months, consumers have kept a tight hold on their wallets as political uncertainty persists and the economy worsens.",

It focuses on Brian, a 45-year-old sad sack with a yen for light verse and custard creams, who has decided he must change his life. His ex-wife Sophie has fallen for a new man, a motivational speaker and life coach.

My friends arrived, we got going on the dips and watched the buildup. Kane and Winks starting. Was that good? We weren\u2019t sure. The Champions League theme. No sign of Dad. No blue ticks on WhatsApp. Not even two ticks. Just one. Kick-off. No sign of Dad. Penalty to Liverpool. No sign of Dad. The doorbell rang five minutes in. I poured Dad a glass of red wine and we watched the game. Just after Origi scored I ordered him an Uber. He left before full-time. The game was over and it\u2019d be good to get the 22.12 back home. I offered him the spare room, but he had string quartet in the morning. That cello wasn\u2019t going to play itself. I opened another beer and watched Jordan Henderson\u2019s trophy lift. I texted Mum. \u201cCall when he\u2019s home.\u201d My friends left and I went to bed. The 22.12 was cancelled. Dad walked to St Pancras. He got on the Thameslink. He got a table. It was empty. Until the next stop. Hundreds of Spurs fans got on. \u201cI\u2019m a pisshead,\u201d announced the man opposite Dad. The cab ride from Cambridge station to my parents house is 10 minutes. Unfortunately the queue was a mile long. Dad walked. He got home just before 1am. If I hadn\u2019t written the first article, he could have had a relaxing evening. Instead, I forced an 80-year-old man to leave his whiskey, his armchair and the peace and quiet of his living room, to take a 90-minute train journey in the searing heat so he could watch most of a football match with six people he didn\u2019t know and then take a three-hour journey home in the middle of the night. I guess we\u2019ll always have those 86 minutes.",

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.</p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europeif there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Letwin said: \u201cThat\u2019s an extremely good summary of the situation, alas.\u201d He added: \u201cIf the government doesn\u2019t bring something before parliament, parliament won\u2019t have a chance to take a view on that.\u201d</p> \n<p>He played down the prospect of Tory MPs voting down their own government to prevent no deal.

I can\u2019t do anything about the more hysterical complaints but many issues can be resolved by spending a few minutes in the settings app. I\u2019m therefore accepting FlintyMcQwerty\u2019s invitation to explain a few of them.</p> <p>The one thing you have to accept is that Windows 10, like Windows 8, has two applications programming interfaces, and both are required to meet the needs of a changing world. There\u2019s an old API for traditional programs run with a mouse, and a new one for finger-friendly apps that work on touchscreen tablets and convertibles. </p> <p>Tens of millions of us are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/11/laptop-tablet-hybrid-microsoft-two-in-one\">already using Windows 10 devices with touchscreens</a> and we may well become the majority. However, \u201cmodern\u201d apps are now opened, resized and closed in exactly the same way as traditional programs and they work perfectly well with mice, so why complain about them? It\u2019s not a fundamental change like the one from character-based MS-DOS to graphical Windows.</p> <p>In fact, anyone who learned how to use Windows 95 when it came out should have no problem running Windows 10 today. The basic elements of a Start menu, a taskbar and clickable icons haven\u2019t changed, even if the implementations look a little different.</p> <h2><strong>1 Use the taskbar</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93b18ebbbffc9b1812ef1372d1dd72fdd32b937a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93b18ebbbffc9b1812ef1372d1dd72fdd32b937a/0_182_2736_1642/1000.jpg\" alt=\"windows 10\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If you want quick access to a program pin it to your taskbar or to the Start menu as a Live Tile.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The quickest and easiest way to run programs in Windows 10 is to pin them to the taskbar, where they are very visible and only a click away. You should have at least nine of your most-used programs pinned because you can run them by pressing the shortcut combination of the Windows Key plus a number. WinKey-5 will run the fifth program in the line with no need to switch to the mouse. Keep the order the same and you\u2019ll soon learn which is which.</p> <p>There are other ways to run programs you don\u2019t use very often. The hallowed method is to put their icons on the desktop. The modern alternative is to pin the program\u2019s icon to the Start menu, creating a Live Tile, which is mainly an icon in a box. The advantages are that it\u2019s bigger and much easier to hit; it\u2019s not cluttering up your desktop and it\u2019s not buried at the bottom of a long menu.</p> <p>Remove all the tiles you don\u2019t want (right-click and select \u201cunpin from Start\u201d), resize the panel and group the tiles you need at the top. After that, you can run programs quickly by hitting the Windows key to open the Start menu, then clicking a tile. This is much easier than scrolling down the Start menu, especially when many programs are in sub-menus.</p> <h2><strong>2 Quick access to files</strong></h2> <p>One reader missed the \u201cjump list\u201d, which provided Start menu access to recently used files in Windows 7. They have not gone away. First, you get a jump list of recently used files by right-clicking an icon on the taskbar. Second, there\u2019s a list of 20 recently used files in the \u201cquick access\u201d panel in file explorer. Third, the new task view provides access to the hundreds you may have used over the past few days.</p> <p>If your file explorer shows default folders such as documents and pictures, you can scroll up to find the \u201cquick access\u201d section, which has bookmarks for files and folders. If you want to get to a folder very quickly, right-click it and select \u201cpin to quick access\u201d to bookmark it. (Another option is \u201cpin to Start\u201d.)</p> <p>To change the default setting, open file explorer, go to the view tab, and click the down-arrow, under options on the far right. Next, select \u201cchange folder and search options\u201d from the drop-down menu. The top line of the resulting panel says \u201copen file explorer to:\u201d, and you can choose either \u201cthis PC\u201d or \u201cquick access\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>3 Try task view</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e032892849460fadba5591354ed6451a345a2e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e032892849460fadba5591354ed6451a345a2e1/0_30_2736_1642/1000.jpg\" alt=\"windows 10\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Windows 10\u2019s timeline shows you files, sites and apps you\u2019ve recently used so you can jump straight back in.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s an even easier way to return to something you were doing earlier: click its thumbnail image in Windows 10\u2019s task view, aka timeline. You can call up the task view by clicking its white icon, which is next to the search box on the taskbar, or by pressing WinKey+Tab.</p> <p>Task view saves time-stamped thumbnails of files you have used recently. It\u2019s usually easier to recognise and click a thumbnail than to pick a file name from a text menu.</p> <p>Scroll to the bottom of the task view for the option to store up to 30 days of activity online, rather than on your PC. This also lets you continue an activity on a different device. However, it may involve <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4468227/windows-10-activity-history-and-your-privacy-microsoft-privacy\">a loss of privacy</a>, even if only Microsoft\u2019s AI reads your data to make suggestions.</p> <p>To clear or manage your data, go to the privacy section of the settings (cogwheel) app and click \u201cactivity history\u201d. This page has tick boxes for \u201cstore my activity history on this device\u201d and \u201csend my activity history to Microsoft\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>4 Virtual desktops</strong></h2> <p>Task view also lets you have multiple virtual desktops in Windows 10, simply by clicking \u201cnew desktop\u201d. You can set up different desktops for different scenarios: one for work, one for email and one for social networking, for example. You can move rapidly between desktops by holding down Ctrl-WinKey and pressing a left or right arrow key, rather than going back to task view.</p> <p>Every virtual desktop has the same taskbar, icons and wallpaper but it\u2019s cheaper than buying three or four monitors.</p> <h2><strong>5 Cloud clipboard</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7847e4ac5f7e21ffd98ab4cf126c27fe5b23a064\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7847e4ac5f7e21ffd98ab4cf126c27fe5b23a064/0_418_1480_887/1000.jpg\" alt=\"windows 10\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cloud clipboard can sync your copies across machines.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Everybody uses a clipboard to copy something from one application and paste it into something else, usually by using Ctrl-C (copy) and Ctrl-V (paste). Windows 10\u2019s clipboard has the option to store its history in the cloud. Now you can re-paste items you copied earlier, pin items you paste often, and copy things on one device and paste them on a different device. As with task view, there are privacy implications. However, you can control what\u2019s allowed and clear your clipboard data from the clipboard page in the \u201csystem\u201d section of the settings app.</p> <p>The cloud clipboard uses WinKey-V to paste, instead of Ctrl-V. Sadly, it doesn\u2019t have the \u201csmart paste\u201d features that you get with Ctrl-Alt-V in Microsoft Word.</p> <h2><strong>6 Mousewheel scrolling</strong></h2> <p>You can have lots of different windows from different applications on screen at the same time but only one of them is \u201cactive\u201d. However, it\u2019s really useful to be able to scroll texts in background windows without having to click in them to make them active. To turn this feature on, go to the devices section in the settings app and open the mouse page. The last item is \u201cscroll inactive windows when I hover over them\u201d. Simply set the switch to on.</p> <h2><strong>7 Tame notifications (and ads)</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"adaae88cf4bc6f9352c09b5429f4cea957a9a8f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adaae88cf4bc6f9352c09b5429f4cea957a9a8f7/0_0_2736_1642/1000.jpg\" alt=\"windows 10\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tame your notifications using the settings app.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Notifications are interruptions and Windows 10 makes it easy to avoid most of them. Go to the system section of the settings app and select the \u201cnotifications &amp; actions\u201d page. You can turn off \u201cthe Windows welcome experience after updates\u201d and Microsoft\u2019s \u201ctips, tricks and suggestions as you use Windows\u201d. You can also go through all the apps that can send notifications and turn off the ones you don\u2019t want to hear from, including \u201csuggested\u201d. Clicking an app\u2019s icon provides fine tuning. You can allow text but turn off sounds, for example.</p> <p>You can also eliminate more suggestions from the personalisation section. Go to the lock-screen page to turn off \u201cget fun facts, tips, and more from Windows and Cortana on your lock screen\u201d. Go to the Start page to turn off \u201cshow suggestions occasionally in Start\u201d.</p> <p>Also, if you don\u2019t have Microsoft Office installed, it may be suggested. Do you have a program called Get Office in Your Start Menu? If so, you can right-click it and select \u201cuninstall\u201d.</p> <p>Maybe at least one of these tips will save you from getting stressed about something you can fix. As Benjamin Franklin said: \u201cAn ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Have you got a question?

Every virtual desktop has the same taskbar, icons and wallpaper but it\u2019s cheaper than buying three or four monitors. 5 Cloud clipboard Everybody uses a clipboard to copy something from one application and paste it into something else, usually by using Ctrl-C (copy) and Ctrl-V (paste). Windows 10\u2019s clipboard has the option to store its history in the cloud. Now you can re-paste items you copied earlier, pin items you paste often, and copy things on one device and paste them on a different device. As with task view, there are privacy implications.

To turn this feature on, go to the devices section in the settings app and open the mouse page. The last item is \u201cscroll inactive windows when I hover over them\u201d. Simply set the switch to on. 7 Tame notifications (and ads) Notifications are interruptions and Windows 10 makes it easy to avoid most of them. Go to the system section of the settings app and select the \u201cnotifications &amp; actions\u201d page. You can turn off \u201cthe Windows welcome experience after updates\u201d and Microsoft\u2019s \u201ctips, tricks and suggestions as you use Windows\u201d. You can also go through all the apps that can send notifications and turn off the ones you don\u2019t want to hear from, including \u201csuggested\u201d. Clicking an app\u2019s icon provides fine tuning. You can allow text but turn off sounds, for example. You can also eliminate more suggestions from the personalisation section. Go to the lock-screen page to turn off \u201cget fun facts, tips, and more from Windows and Cortana on your lock screen\u201d. Go to the Start page to turn off \u201cshow suggestions occasionally in Start\u201d. Also, if you don\u2019t have Microsoft Office installed, it may be suggested. Do you have a program called Get Office in Your Start Menu? If so, you can right-click it and select \u201cuninstall\u201d. Maybe at least one of these tips will save you from getting stressed about something you can fix.

      "body": "<p>Most women who have ever had to express breast milk will recognise the facial expressions of the comedian <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bxvw6YmluZs/\" title=\"\">Amy Schumer</a> in the pictures she has put up on her Instagram account in the past few weeks. There she is, hooked up to her double breast pump, looking tired and a bit bored, and at the same time grateful to be sitting down. As you may expect from Schumer\u2019s work, it\u2019s relatable \u2013 more so than the proliferation of more glamorous breast pump selfies from celebrities such as <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/john-legend-chrissy-teigen-breast-milk-pumping-fathers-day-instagram-a8405331.html\" title=\"\">Chrissy Teigen</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BX3d2kBF0g0/\" title=\"\">Pink</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bt4t-oVhYd2/\" title=\"\">Kate Upton</a>.</p> <p>At least they are all making milk expressing more mainstream, a momentum that has been building for a while. The actor <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Brhe4xHgQqY/?utm_source=ig_embed\" title=\"\">Rachel McAdams</a> was photographed for a magazine last year accessorising her double breast pump with diamonds and a Versace jacket. The TV series The Good Fight recently showed one of the lawyers expressing in her office and, last September, the model Valeria Garcia walked the catwalk at London fashion week \u201cwearing\u201d a breast pump. Amid the random, but pricey, selection of wares that made up the goodie bags for the nominees at the Oscars earlier this year was a breast pump \u2013 perhaps the surest sign yet that expressing milk is coming out of the closet and becoming more visible.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"afd486e6e55e99a861c60bbd93a9631dba0cb2a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afd486e6e55e99a861c60bbd93a9631dba0cb2a3/0_66_620_620/500.jpg\" alt=\"Chrissy Tiegen expressing in the car, with her husband John Legend\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chrissy Tiegen expressing in the car, with her husband John Legend.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Instagram/johnlegend</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In February, the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn/status/1098569224539262976?lang=en-gb\" title=\"\">retweeted a news story</a> about breastfeeding working mothers being forced to express in the toilets, adding \u201cso much more needs to be done to make our workplaces welcoming for new mums\u201d. Which isn\u2019t an unusual or controversial opinion, but the accompanying large photograph of a woman using a double breast pump was an uncommon and arresting sight.</p> <p>Last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/sep/16/athlete-breastfed-son-during-ultra-marathon\" title=\"\">an image went viral of the athlete Sophie Power</a> feeding her three-month-old son on one breast while pumping milk from the other at a rest stop during the 105-mile Ultra-Trail du Mont Blanc race. This year, another ultrarunner, Jasmin Paris, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/17/jasmin-paris-first-woman-win-gruelling-286-mile-montane-spice-race-ultrarunning\" title=\"\">stopped along the 268-mile Montane Spine race</a> \u2013 which she won, with hours to spare \u2013 to express milk for her 14-month-old daughter.</p> <p>I have not expressed breast milk while performing such heroics, although I did once do it in the stinky toilets on a moving Southeastern train. Returning to work five months after the birth of my second baby \u2013 and having chosen, and been able, to breastfeed \u2013 I am having to reacquaint myself with my breast pump. First time around, I had to express to increase my nonexistent milk supply, and my stubborn wish to breastfeed meant I was trapped in a bovine and mostly miserable cycle of feeding, then pumping with the double-attachment hospital-grade machine I had hired, then feeding again.</p> <p>Once back at work, a less alarming electric pump allowed me to keep breastfeeding (I had soon ditched the manual pump I had tried). My relationship with my <a href=\"https://www.medela.co.uk/breastfeeding/products/breast-pumps\" title=\"\">Medela pump</a> varies between gratitude and grudge. It has allowed me to continue breastfeeding \u2013 and allow other people to take on feeding duties and prevent infections such as mastitis \u2013 but the constant sterilising, assembling, transporting, labelling, freezing and defrosting is a hassle.</p> <p>I am lucky in that I work mainly from home, but I have expressed while commuting, in department stores and pub toilets, while driving (not advised) and, once, sobbing in the ladies\u2019 toilets while on a press junket \u2013 with painful, solid boobs and a pump that had run out of batteries \u2013 hand expressing into the toilet bowl. And yes, I realise how filthy that sounds. Who knows what the other journalists thought I had been doing when I crept into a group interview, late and stained. That was only four years ago but, as a measure of how much more visible milk-expressing has become, this time around I would ask for a proper place and time to do it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"21944ee512e8a4d5e0ce518a3590e3fc845fdb8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21944ee512e8a4d5e0ce518a3590e3fc845fdb8b/0_35_1677_1727/971.jpg\" alt=\"A Medela breast pump\" width=\"971\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Using Medela\u2019s breast pump requires constant sterilising, assembling, labelling and freezing</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Breast-pump companies are reporting rises in sales \u2013 Medela, the market leader, says sales have grown at roughly 10% a year for the past five years \u2013 and tech businesses are taking notice. The first <a href=\"https://www.makethebreastpumpnotsuck.com/why-breastfeeding-innovation\" title=\"\">Make the Breast Pump Not Suck</a> hackathon was held by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2014 to improve a machine that had barely changed in several decades; the project, which aims to support breastfeeding innovation, is still going.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.elvie.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI7LWR5vHF4QIV55XtCh2pxQ4SEAAYASAAEgK9CPD_BwE\" title=\"\">Elvie pump</a> (from the makers of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/02/pelvic-floor-bladder-urinary-leakage-incontinence-women-bluetooth-elvie\" title=\"\">Elvie kegel trainer</a>) \u2013 the one included in the Oscars swag bag \u2013 was launched in September last year and the company has raised millions in investment. It already has a strong social media presence, where women share pictures of themselves pumping. The pump is designed to be worn inside your bra, with no wires or tubes and can be controlled by an app on your phone that tells you how you are doing. The maker claims you can pump \u201cat home, at work or on the go\u201d, and even suggests you can \u201clead the meeting\u201d. Would you want to lead a meeting while a machine drains your breast? I suppose some women might (or might have to). But one of the benefits I have found about breastfeeding, and expressing, is that you get to sit down a lot.</p> <p>I tried the Elvie pump at home, enjoying the novelty of being able to move around and get on with important tasks such as foraging for snacks. It feels modern \u2013 I charged it through the USB port on my laptop \u2013 but is expensive at \u00a3249 for a single pump. It is not as discreet as Elvie claims. Although it is very quiet, when popped inside your bra it creates the appearance of a noticeably giant breast. I synced it to the free app, which means you can control the pump using your phone, and monitored the use in real time: 12 minutes on one side should have produced 30ml of milk. But it turned out to be wrong \u2013 it is only supposed to be an estimate, but when decanted into a measuring jug, there was nearly twice that amount (when you are expressing, you become obsessed with every drop because getting it out is such a bore). I regularly started using the pump on train journeys, and once in a restaurant, although I soon gave up on the app. But if you are the sort of Oscar nominee who enjoys being untethered and monitoring bodily functions, I can see its appeal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"255aecaba58f568837020ceb16a7678faace0123\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/255aecaba58f568837020ceb16a7678faace0123/502_462_1155_1155/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Elvie breast pump, showing front and back views\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Elvie breast pump, showing front and back views</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And if you are the sort of employer who doesn\u2019t feel like giving your new-mother employees the time and space to express milk, I can also see its appeal. I doubt this was the maker\u2019s intention, but it is easy to see how milk-expressing wearables might become an unwelcome solution to the problem of pumping while working.</p> <p>If milk-expressing \u2013 that reality for many working women who breastfeed \u2013 is becoming more visible, legislation is still to catch up. \u201cThe law as it stands is inadequate with respect to <a href=\"https://maternityaction.org.uk/advice/continuing-to-breastfeed-when-you-return-to-work/\" title=\"\">what employers are required to do</a> to support breastfeeding mothers returning to work, including those who wish to express at work,\u201d says Paula Chan, a specialist employment lawyer at Slater and Gordon.

Of the 2,000 working mothers surveyed who had had a baby in the past five years, 18% had had to use a staff room for expressing, 14% had used their car and 11% had had to do it at their desk. Most women \u2013 70% \u2013 said their employer didn\u2019t raise the issue before they returned to work, but 29% of women said they had felt too embarrassed to talk about it.

This time, she is working in a school where the teachers are with the children all day, so it\u2019s a case of finding a quiet 10 minutes to go and express when she can.

      "bodyText": "Most women who have ever had to express breast milk will recognise the facial expressions of the comedian Amy Schumer in the pictures she has put up on her Instagram account in the past few weeks. There she is, hooked up to her double breast pump, looking tired and a bit bored, and at the same time grateful to be sitting down. As you may expect from Schumer\u2019s work, it\u2019s relatable \u2013 more so than the proliferation of more glamorous breast pump selfies from celebrities such as Chrissy Teigen, Pink and Kate Upton. At least they are all making milk expressing more mainstream, a momentum that has been building for a while. The actor Rachel McAdams was photographed for a magazine last year accessorising her double breast pump with diamonds and a Versace jacket. The TV series The Good Fight recently showed one of the lawyers expressing in her office and, last September, the model Valeria Garcia walked the catwalk at London fashion week \u201cwearing\u201d a breast pump. Amid the random, but pricey, selection of wares that made up the goodie bags for the nominees at the Oscars earlier this year was a breast pump \u2013 perhaps the surest sign yet that expressing milk is coming out of the closet and becoming more visible. In February, the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn retweeted a news story about breastfeeding working mothers being forced to express in the toilets, adding \u201cso much more needs to be done to make our workplaces welcoming for new mums\u201d. Which isn\u2019t an unusual or controversial opinion, but the accompanying large photograph of a woman using a double breast pump was an uncommon and arresting sight. Last year, an image went viral of the athlete Sophie Power feeding her three-month-old son on one breast while pumping milk from the other at a rest stop during the 105-mile Ultra-Trail du Mont Blanc race. This year, another ultrarunner, Jasmin Paris, stopped along the 268-mile Montane Spine race \u2013 which she won, with hours to spare \u2013 to express milk for her 14-month-old daughter. I have not expressed breast milk while performing such heroics, although I did once do it in the stinky toilets on a moving Southeastern train. Returning to work five months after the birth of my second baby \u2013 and having chosen, and been able, to breastfeed \u2013 I am having to reacquaint myself with my breast pump. First time around, I had to express to increase my nonexistent milk supply, and my stubborn wish to breastfeed meant I was trapped in a bovine and mostly miserable cycle of feeding, then pumping with the double-attachment hospital-grade machine I had hired, then feeding again. Once back at work, a less alarming electric pump allowed me to keep breastfeeding (I had soon ditched the manual pump I had tried). My relationship with my Medela pump varies between gratitude and grudge. It has allowed me to continue breastfeeding \u2013 and allow other people to take on feeding duties and prevent infections such as mastitis \u2013 but the constant sterilising, assembling, transporting, labelling, freezing and defrosting is a hassle. I am lucky in that I work mainly from home, but I have expressed while commuting, in department stores and pub toilets, while driving (not advised) and, once, sobbing in the ladies\u2019 toilets while on a press junket \u2013 with painful, solid boobs and a pump that had run out of batteries \u2013 hand expressing into the toilet bowl. And yes, I realise how filthy that sounds. Who knows what the other journalists thought I had been doing when I crept into a group interview, late and stained. That was only four years ago but, as a measure of how much more visible milk-expressing has become, this time around I would ask for a proper place and time to do it. Breast-pump companies are reporting rises in sales \u2013 Medela, the market leader, says sales have grown at roughly 10% a year for the past five years \u2013 and tech businesses are taking notice. The first Make the Breast Pump Not Suck hackathon was held by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2014 to improve a machine that had barely changed in several decades; the project, which aims to support breastfeeding innovation, is still going. The Elvie pump (from the makers of the Elvie kegel trainer) \u2013 the one included in the Oscars swag bag \u2013 was launched in September last year and the company has raised millions in investment. It already has a strong social media presence, where women share pictures of themselves pumping. The pump is designed to be worn inside your bra, with no wires or tubes and can be controlled by an app on your phone that tells you how you are doing. The maker claims you can pump \u201cat home, at work or on the go\u201d, and even suggests you can \u201clead the meeting\u201d. Would you want to lead a meeting while a machine drains your breast? I suppose some women might (or might have to). But one of the benefits I have found about breastfeeding, and expressing, is that you get to sit down a lot. I tried the Elvie pump at home, enjoying the novelty of being able to move around and get on with important tasks such as foraging for snacks. It feels modern \u2013 I charged it through the USB port on my laptop \u2013 but is expensive at \u00a3249 for a single pump. It is not as discreet as Elvie claims. Although it is very quiet, when popped inside your bra it creates the appearance of a noticeably giant breast. I synced it to the free app, which means you can control the pump using your phone, and monitored the use in real time: 12 minutes on one side should have produced 30ml of milk. But it turned out to be wrong \u2013 it is only supposed to be an estimate, but when decanted into a measuring jug, there was nearly twice that amount (when you are expressing, you become obsessed with every drop because getting it out is such a bore). I regularly started using the pump on train journeys, and once in a restaurant, although I soon gave up on the app. But if you are the sort of Oscar nominee who enjoys being untethered and monitoring bodily functions, I can see its appeal. And if you are the sort of employer who doesn\u2019t feel like giving your new-mother employees the time and space to express milk, I can also see its appeal. I doubt this was the maker\u2019s intention, but it is easy to see how milk-expressing wearables might become an unwelcome solution to the problem of pumping while working. If milk-expressing \u2013 that reality for many working women who breastfeed \u2013 is becoming more visible, legislation is still to catch up. \u201cThe law as it stands is inadequate with respect to what employers are required to do to support breastfeeding mothers returning to work, including those who wish to express at work,\u201d says Paula Chan, a specialist employment lawyer at Slater and Gordon. In the UK, there are no rights to paid breaks or even \u201ca basic legal requirement to provide facilities to enable mothers to express milk\u201d, which should include a private room and somewhere to store milk. \u201cIn terms of what employers are required to do, there is a duty to provide a place for breastfeeding mothers to rest, and to carry out a risk assessment of issues, such as working conditions, or risks to the health and safety of the mother or her baby,\u201d says Chan. Employers are also legally required to consider flexible working requests, which a mother might make to accommodate breastfeeding. According to the 2010 Infant Feeding Survey, almost a third of working mothers had returned to work when their babies were between eight and 10 months old \u2013 when they are still very much reliant on milk. Just one in five working mothers \u2013 and nearly a quarter in Scotland \u2013 said that they were given facilities to feed or express at work. Ros Bragg, director of Maternity Action, which campaigns for the rights of pregnant women and mothers, says there is concern about the UK\u2019s comparatively low rates of breastfeeding, but this hasn\u2019t translated into any changes in the law that would help breastfeeding mothers returning to work. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t addressed in the Taylor review into modern working practices [an independent report submitted to the government in 2017], it\u2019s not part of the recent NHS long-term plan and is simply not visible on the government\u2019s policy agenda,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re often frustrated that the needs of pregnant women and new mothers are not treated as a priority in decision-making by government.\u201d The UK, unlike many other European countries, she says, is unusual in not having a statutory right to breastfeeding or expressing breaks. \u201cAs a result, women who would like to express milk on their return to work are very much reliant on their employer\u2019s good intentions.\u201d A study this year by Slater and Gordon found that one in three breastfeeding mothers had been forced to use a toilet to express milk.

Terry Lee, the hotel\u2019s \u201ctoe expert\u201d will now preserve the digits in rock salt for at least six weeks before they are served in whiskey. \u201cThe big toe is the money toe,\u201d Lee told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. \u201cWe usually don\u2019t get frostbitten toes. Usually, they\u2019re from gout or diabetes, or they\u2019re lawnmowers or chainsaws or accidents \u2026 to get a frostbitten toe, that\u2019s phenomenal.\u201d There are currently three toes in use. In recent years, the hotel has grappled with a spate of toe thefts, and the hotel now nails anyone who attempts to swipe a toe with a fine of C$2,500 (\u00a31,500). The establishment is now trying to convince Griffiths to make the trip to the Yukon to try the cocktail. He is not sure if anyone has ever sipped the whiskey with their own toe swirling around, but is keen to be the first. \u201cPeople look at you as though you\u2019re a bit mad, he said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s a nice little bit of fun.\u201d",

The court accepted that he had nonconsensual sex with his daughter \u2013 but said it could not prove that she resisted, and acquitted him.</p> \n<p>Similar protests have been held in nine cities across the country, and more than 40,000 women have signed petitions demanding justice.

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.</p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europeif there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Speaking after the defeat in the Commons, the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, said Labour would continue its cross-party efforts to stop no deal.</p> \n<p>\u201cLabour stands ready to use whatever mechanism it can to protect jobs, the economy and communities from the disastrous consequences of a no-deal Brexit,\u201d he said. \u201cAny Tory leadership candidate should know that parliament will continue to fight against no deal.\u201d</p> \n<p>One shadow minister said opponents of a no-deal Brexit had missed a crucial opportunity and believed they had been scuppered by the timing. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the end of it.

      "body": "<p>\u201cUnder the pressure of the cares and sorrows of our mortal condition,\u201d Edmund Burke wrote, \u201cmen have at all times, and in all countries, called in some physical aid to their moral consolations \u2013 wine, beer, opium, brandy, or tobacco.\u201d Mescaline, for those who don\u2019t know \u2013 for drinkers, smokers, self-deniers, prohibitionists, the pious, and all straight-edge, clean-living types \u2013 is a naturally occurring psychedelic alkaloid, known for its powerful hallucinogenic effects and used for thousands of years by the indigenous peoples of the Americas. It is derived from the peyote cactus and other members of the cactus family, was first synthesised in the laboratory in the early 20th century, and was made famous by Aldous Huxley\u2019s thoughtful account of his experimentation with the drug in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/26/doors-perception-huxley-mescaline-reading-group\" title=\"\"><em>The Doors of Perception</em></a> (1954) and Hunter S Thompson\u2019s completely frenzied account of his experiences on \u201cthe fiendish cactus juice\u201d in <em>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</em> (1971).</p> <p>Mike Jay is an eminent writer on mind-stilling and mind-expanding substances, having written numerous books, including what is by far the best study of laughing gas (<em>The Atmosphere of Heaven</em>), and just about the only book on the ancient ritual drink soma (<em>The Blue Tide</em>). <em>Mescaline</em> reads like the culmination of a lifetime\u2019s wanderings in the very farthest outposts of scientific and medical history. It roams from speculation about the use of psychedelic snuff in the prehistoric Chav\u00edn culture of the northern Andes, to descriptions of the pre-conquest peyote rituals of the Nahua in Mexico and Comanche chief Quanah Parker\u2019s promotion of the peyote religion, to a detailed account and analysis of Walter Benjamin\u2019s drug habit, the CIA\u2019s covert MK-Ultra drug-testing programme, and the recent popularity of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/31/colombia-ayahuasca-drug-trade-spotlight-after-britons-death\" title=\"\">ayahuasca ceremonies</a>. Who knew that Frederick Madison Smith, grandson of Joseph Smith and the third Mormon prophet-president, was a peyote enthusiast?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>The author\u2019s account of his own experiment with some boiled cactus and cane\u00a0sugar is revealing, as well as off-putting</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Despite its breadth \u2013 because of its breadth \u2013 Jay\u2019s is a highly nuanced account. His aim is to study the uses and effects of mescaline in its many and diverse historical and cultural contexts. Western modernity, he notes, has often focused on the nature of mescaline visions, ascribing them meanings variously \u201cneurological, literary, occult, psychodynamic, aesthetic, spiritual\u201d, while indigenous cultures have tended to regard the visions as of merely peripheral interest, compared to the life-enhancing importance of rituals and ceremonies. \u201cThe distinction,\u201d he notes, \u201cbetween western and indigenous understandings of mescaline maps closely, though not exactly, on to the distinction between pure mescaline, the product of the 20th-century laboratory, and its natural sources: two families of cactus, the peyote of Mexico and the San Pedro of the Andes.\u201d</p> <p>The book is by no means a user\u2019s guide, but Jay clearly has some personal interest in the subject. \u201cMy uncle Peter \u2026 after reading <em>The Doors of Perception</em> \u2026 visited the office of Aldrich, the research chemical supplier, outside London and casually requested some \u2026 He was sold half a kilo, over a thousand doses, which kept the beatnik vanguard of Soho and the Sussex coasts supplied for some time.\u201d The book ends with the author\u2019s account of his own participation in an elaborate and mystical peyote ceremony, though his account of an earlier rough-and-ready experiment with some boiled cactus and cane sugar is perhaps rather more revealing, as well as off-putting: \u201cLanguorous muscle relaxation combined with tremors, restlessness and nausea; fizzing euphoria with the ominous sensation of a fast-rising fever; a thrumming vibration in the chest with a cold heaviness in the limbs.\u201d The warm glow from a swift half after work or a stiff G&amp;T this is not.</p> <p>Undoubtedly the most famous description of the effects of taking mescaline is from <em>The Doors of Perception</em>, in which Huxley describes \u201cThose folds in the trousers \u2013 what a labyrinth of endlessly significant complexity! And the texture of the grey flannel \u2013 how rich, how deeply, mysteriously sumptuous!\u201d Jay notes that Huxley had in fact been wearing jeans during the actual experiment and that it was only his wife Maria\u2019s insistence that he should be rather \u201cbetter dressed\u201d for his readers that turned Huxley\u2019s blue jeans into grey flannel.

      "bodyText": "\u201cUnder the pressure of the cares and sorrows of our mortal condition,\u201d Edmund Burke wrote, \u201cmen have at all times, and in all countries, called in some physical aid to their moral consolations \u2013 wine, beer, opium, brandy, or tobacco.\u201d Mescaline, for those who don\u2019t know \u2013 for drinkers, smokers, self-deniers, prohibitionists, the pious, and all straight-edge, clean-living types \u2013 is a naturally occurring psychedelic alkaloid, known for its powerful hallucinogenic effects and used for thousands of years by the indigenous peoples of the Americas. It is derived from the peyote cactus and other members of the cactus family, was first synthesised in the laboratory in the early 20th century, and was made famous by Aldous Huxley\u2019s thoughtful account of his experimentation with the drug in The Doors of Perception (1954) and Hunter S Thompson\u2019s completely frenzied account of his experiences on \u201cthe fiendish cactus juice\u201d in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1971). Mike Jay is an eminent writer on mind-stilling and mind-expanding substances, having written numerous books, including what is by far the best study of laughing gas (The Atmosphere of Heaven), and just about the only book on the ancient ritual drink soma (The Blue Tide). Mescaline reads like the culmination of a lifetime\u2019s wanderings in the very farthest outposts of scientific and medical history. It roams from speculation about the use of psychedelic snuff in the prehistoric Chav\u00edn culture of the northern Andes, to descriptions of the pre-conquest peyote rituals of the Nahua in Mexico and Comanche chief Quanah Parker\u2019s promotion of the peyote religion, to a detailed account and analysis of Walter Benjamin\u2019s drug habit, the CIA\u2019s covert MK-Ultra drug-testing programme, and the recent popularity of ayahuasca ceremonies. Who knew that Frederick Madison Smith, grandson of Joseph Smith and the third Mormon prophet-president, was a peyote enthusiast? Despite its breadth \u2013 because of its breadth \u2013 Jay\u2019s is a highly nuanced account. His aim is to study the uses and effects of mescaline in its many and diverse historical and cultural contexts. Western modernity, he notes, has often focused on the nature of mescaline visions, ascribing them meanings variously \u201cneurological, literary, occult, psychodynamic, aesthetic, spiritual\u201d, while indigenous cultures have tended to regard the visions as of merely peripheral interest, compared to the life-enhancing importance of rituals and ceremonies. \u201cThe distinction,\u201d he notes, \u201cbetween western and indigenous understandings of mescaline maps closely, though not exactly, on to the distinction between pure mescaline, the product of the 20th-century laboratory, and its natural sources: two families of cactus, the peyote of Mexico and the San Pedro of the Andes.\u201d The book is by no means a user\u2019s guide, but Jay clearly has some personal interest in the subject. \u201cMy uncle Peter \u2026 after reading The Doors of Perception \u2026 visited the office of Aldrich, the research chemical supplier, outside London and casually requested some \u2026 He was sold half a kilo, over a thousand doses, which kept the beatnik vanguard of Soho and the Sussex coasts supplied for some time.\u201d The book ends with the author\u2019s account of his own participation in an elaborate and mystical peyote ceremony, though his account of an earlier rough-and-ready experiment with some boiled cactus and cane sugar is perhaps rather more revealing, as well as off-putting: \u201cLanguorous muscle relaxation combined with tremors, restlessness and nausea; fizzing euphoria with the ominous sensation of a fast-rising fever; a thrumming vibration in the chest with a cold heaviness in the limbs.\u201d The warm glow from a swift half after work or a stiff G&amp;T this is not. Undoubtedly the most famous description of the effects of taking mescaline is from The Doors of Perception, in which Huxley describes \u201cThose folds in the trousers \u2013 what a labyrinth of endlessly significant complexity! And the texture of the grey flannel \u2013 how rich, how deeply, mysteriously sumptuous!\u201d Jay notes that Huxley had in fact been wearing jeans during the actual experiment and that it was only his wife Maria\u2019s insistence that he should be rather \u201cbetter dressed\u201d for his readers that turned Huxley\u2019s blue jeans into grey flannel.

The president, the former civil war general Otto P\u00e9rez Molina, had \u2013 along with most of his government \u2013 been forced to resign by an unprecedented wave of weekly anti-corruption protests that morphed into a popular uprising. \u201cWe did it \u2013 the people did it \u2013 and it felt like a new start,\u201d said Wer, 37, co-founder of the #JusticiaYa (JusticeNow) movement which spearheaded the demonstrations. \u201cWe knew the whole system had to change \u2013 not just a few politicians. But honestly, it felt like we\u2019d started the Central American spring.\u201d Four years on, as Guatemala heads to the polls to elect a new president, vice-president, 158 congress members and 340 mayors, fears are growing that winter is coming. Crucial reforms to clean up the country\u2019s politics and justice system have been thwarted by Congress and courts in a coordinated pushback plotted from the military-run Mariscal prison where elite crime bosses including P\u00e9rez Molina are detained. The fightback has been fronted by the current president, Jimmy Morales, a former blackface comedian who capitalised on widespread public disillusionment to win the 2015 elections under the slogan \u201cnot corrupt, nor a thief\u201d. At first, Morales backed the UN-backed investigatory body which had provided the evidence of Molina\u2019s crimes. Over the past decade, the Commission against Impunity (Cicig) has helped local prosecutors bring charges against 680 people including four presidents, military officers, judges, drug traffickers and powerful entrepreneurs. Key figures in a massive customs fraud case \u2013 the trigger for the 2015 protests \u2013 gave evidence revealing how powerful crime networks that emerged during the 1960-1996 civil war had spread throughout state institutions. Cicig was hailed as a model for other countries in the region, but as investigators shifted their focus to Morales, his family and his political allies, the president turned on the commission. Morales has faced three impeachment votes \u2013 two linked to illegal campaign financing. In response, he sanctioned the end of Cicig \u2013 in direct disobedience of the country\u2019s highest court \u2013 and, banished its commissioner, Iv\u00e1n Vel\u00e1squez, claiming the veteran Colombian crime fighter threatened national security. The Cicig mandate ends in September despite 80% of the population backing its work. \u201cIllegal political funding is one of the biggest obstacles in Guatemala to building a functioning democracy \u2013 and that\u2019s why our achievements in exposing the \u2018original sin\u2019 generated such a big reaction against us,\u201d Vel\u00e1squez told the Guardian. The backlash against anti-corruption efforts will have real consequences at the polls this Sunday. During the 2011 and 2015 general elections, political parties received 50% of their funds from organised crime and corruption, according to Cicig research. \u201cOur goal was to investigate the 2019 elections in real time to make them the most transparent yet, but we\u2019ve been unable to do so because of our reduced investigative capacity and the decision to end our mandate,\u201d said Vel\u00e1squez.

With the rule of law once more under attack, more and more Guatemalans are deciding to flee \u2013 and most of them are heading north. More than 470,000 Guatemalans have been apprehended at the US border since Morales took power in 2016 \u2013 twice the number during the previous government. Morales recently invited US troops to patrol Guatemala\u2019s border with Mexico, to stop the exodus. \u201cPromising to stop migrants is an overt attempt to buy credibility [with the US] and avoid prosecution,\u201d said Mauro Verzeletti, a priest who runs a migrant shelter.

We have been marching in the streets and calling for treaty since before I was born. It was the catch-cry of our parents, and our grandparents before them. The demand was put forward again in 2017, in the clear and unambiguous statement issued from Uluru. This was a sophisticated and sequenced proposal, calling for a voice, treaty and truth. While the form of words is new, it only echoed the demands of our people through the generations.</p> <p>In 2017, and not for the first time, we saw our proposal dismissed out of hand. While the strength of that statement will not be so easily disregarded, and momentum continues to grow, the delegates of the Victorian Assembly will take their seats knowing that for the moment they are at the forefront of the treaty movement. They will know they have the first, and perhaps the best opportunity to demonstrate what treaty can deliver for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people alike.</p> <p>As such, the stakes are high. Treaty has been held up as our greatest aspiration, and our best hope for our communities and nations. In attempting to take treaty from rhetoric to reality, the Assembly will need to contend with generations of expectation and promise.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ad2f24a63f7b479f767f0cada45ceb8f39fa747c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad2f24a63f7b479f767f0cada45ceb8f39fa747c/106_743_3615_4519/800.jpg\" alt=\"Marcus Stewart\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The call for treaty has been a long-standing demand of Aboriginal people.

In the first week of June, the Federation of Victorian Traditional Owner Corporations hosted the Native Title Conference in Melbourne. From across the nation, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples met to discuss developments in native title law, and developing approaches to treaty making in both Victoria and the Northern Territory.</p> <p>Representatives from both Canada and New Zealand spoke to the conference, showcasing that treaty relationships in their home countries are common place, and recognition of original sovereignty an ordinary state of affairs. However, what they also made clear is that treaty making is imperfect. By their very nature treaties arise from points of disagreement and often violent conflict. While they can create new relationships, they cannot finally resolve the disputes between the coloniser and the First Nations. Indeed, at best what they can hope to do is provide a basis to recognise the sovereignty of each party, and a framework for ongoing negotiation and co-existence.</p> <p>For the Aboriginal people of Victoria, and their representatives on the Assembly, attempting to formulate a treaty process that meets traditional owner expectations will be a difficult task. As with any political process there will naturally be a lot of differing viewpoints and disagreement as to the best way forward. Already within the traditional owner community there is hot debate as to what should be the focus of treaty making, and whether we have gotten the design of the Assembly right.</p> <p>This points to another hurdle Aboriginal people face in this process, which is the tendency of the non-Aboriginal media to highlight diversity in Aboriginal political views as disorganisation, or even as dysfunction.

      "bodyText": "Before the end of the year delegates for the First People\u2019s Assembly of Victoria are scheduled to take their seats and begin work on negotiating a framework to underpin treaty making in Victoria. In the history of this country, this will be the first elected body of Aboriginal people convened for the sole purpose of devising a process for Aboriginal nations, as sovereign bodies, to reach terms with the colonisers of this land. The call for treaty has been a long-standing demand of Aboriginal people. We have been marching in the streets and calling for treaty since before I was born. It was the catch-cry of our parents, and our grandparents before them. The demand was put forward again in 2017, in the clear and unambiguous statement issued from Uluru. This was a sophisticated and sequenced proposal, calling for a voice, treaty and truth. While the form of words is new, it only echoed the demands of our people through the generations. In 2017, and not for the first time, we saw our proposal dismissed out of hand. While the strength of that statement will not be so easily disregarded, and momentum continues to grow, the delegates of the Victorian Assembly will take their seats knowing that for the moment they are at the forefront of the treaty movement. They will know they have the first, and perhaps the best opportunity to demonstrate what treaty can deliver for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people alike. As such, the stakes are high. Treaty has been held up as our greatest aspiration, and our best hope for our communities and nations. In attempting to take treaty from rhetoric to reality, the Assembly will need to contend with generations of expectation and promise. While this is new ground for us, the same is not true for other Commonwealth nations that have long histories of treaty making. In the first week of June, the Federation of Victorian Traditional Owner Corporations hosted the Native Title Conference in Melbourne. From across the nation, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples met to discuss developments in native title law, and developing approaches to treaty making in both Victoria and the Northern Territory. Representatives from both Canada and New Zealand spoke to the conference, showcasing that treaty relationships in their home countries are common place, and recognition of original sovereignty an ordinary state of affairs. However, what they also made clear is that treaty making is imperfect. By their very nature treaties arise from points of disagreement and often violent conflict. While they can create new relationships, they cannot finally resolve the disputes between the coloniser and the First Nations. Indeed, at best what they can hope to do is provide a basis to recognise the sovereignty of each party, and a framework for ongoing negotiation and co-existence. For the Aboriginal people of Victoria, and their representatives on the Assembly, attempting to formulate a treaty process that meets traditional owner expectations will be a difficult task. As with any political process there will naturally be a lot of differing viewpoints and disagreement as to the best way forward. Already within the traditional owner community there is hot debate as to what should be the focus of treaty making, and whether we have gotten the design of the Assembly right. This points to another hurdle Aboriginal people face in this process, which is the tendency of the non-Aboriginal media to highlight diversity in Aboriginal political views as disorganisation, or even as dysfunction. While contradictory viewpoints are accepted as an ordinary part of healthy debate in white politics, they are perceived as destructive and harmful among Aboriginal people. This is problematic, and needs to be resisted. The Victorian traditional owners come from many nations, and hold many points of view. On the path to treaty we will not always agree. We will have arguments, disagreements and intense debate, and the Assembly is the forum where these discussions can be played out and be resolved. For the first time the Assembly gives us the opportunity to pick our own leadership from across the state by democratic means. It allows for the direct election of 21 traditional owners from nations around Victoria, along with 12 seats reserved for formally recognised traditional owner nations. This is not the perfect model. We know there are other groups in Victoria without formal recognition that will not immediately get a reserved seat. Indeed, the Federation of Victorian Traditional Owner Corporations has advocated for the greater inclusion of these groups, and voices, and once the Assembly is elected we will continue to lobby for a voice for all traditional owner groups and nations. However, despite its flaws the Assembly provides a historic opportunity. While not perfect, after so many years it represents a beginning. Going forward the model, the structures and the entirety of the treaty process will be decided by the elected traditional owners of Victoria. This is a great achievement, and the greatest opportunity for true self-determination in my lifetime.

Seleshi countered that the Sugar Corporation had spent 79m Ethiopian birr (\u00a32.1m) constructing infrastructure and social services in the valley, including schools and health centres. In May, the Guardian visited a \u201cvillagisation\u201d site \u2013 Napusmoria, in the South Omo district of Nyangatom \u2013 and spoke to villagers whose accounts echoed the report\u2019s claims.

He added that \u201cirrigated agriculture is more advantageous because it can produce up to three harvests per year\u201d. Yet there are some signs of a change in approach. At an April seminar on South Omo\u2019s livelihood challenges, held in Addis Ababa government minister Seyoum Mesfin told visiting academics and journalists that the new government recognised certain \u201cdevelopment interventions in the pastoralist areas \u2026 came with a cost.\u201d The minister cited, in particular, \u201cmegaprojects like Gibe III\u201d and added that the government \u201cwill not allow a repeat of those situations\u201d.

Seminole casinos offer card games and slots, but not more high-rolling pursuits such as craps and roulette, while non-tribe casinos are restricted even further. \u201cThere are legislators in South Florida who sit there and wonder why we\u2019re giving a monopoly to the Indians instead of opening up Florida to everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the Las Vegas model where anyone who isn\u2019t a criminal and can pass a background check can run a casino and the state sits back and takes their cut.\u201d In recent years, he said, horse and dog racing tracks and jai-alai frontons have declined in popularity and have been pressuring politicians to allow them a bigger slice of the gambling action as pari-mutuel casinos, or they would face going out of business. Greyhound racing was outlawed in Florida by a public vote in November, and other operators have become mired in lawsuits over the right to offer alternative forms of gambling. John Lockwood, an attorney representing several pari-mutuel casinos, denied his clients were doing anything wrong. \u201cWe\u2019ve litigated this issue and have never got a ruling that these games were illegal under state law,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThe tribe\u2019s position is they violate the compact, our position is that they\u2019re legal under state law.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Often described as the world\u2019s oldest off-road cycling club, the Rough-Stuff Fellowship (RSF) was founded in 1955 by a group of hardy cyclists from northern England who shunned smooth tarmac in favour of bumpy tracks, muddy bridleways and rugged hill passes. Their goal: to traverse \u201cthe rougher and less-beaten ways\u201d. Having lived through at least one world war, these no-nonsense types thought nothing of riding epic distances, often on single-speed, clunky steel steeds, whether to and from work or in pursuit of that relatively new idea, \u201cleisure\u201d. A cyclist welds a crank near Sixt in the French Alps, 1973 It was a time when the British countryside was opening up to working-class people. Britain\u2019s first national park, the Peak District, opened in 1951. Finally, the moors and dales were not just the preserve of wealthy landowners but ordinary people, who could pedal out from their homes in the counties of Lancashire or Yorkshire for a two-wheeled adventure. Off they went, fortified by flasks of tea, sandwiches and perhaps a puff of a pipe, wearing sturdy leather shoes oiled with margarine, woollen knee socks, button-down shirts and tank tops Two couples enjoy the scenery near Sande, Norway Rain stops play at Bealach na Gaoithe during a spring tour, 1972 Undeterred by the foulest weather, cyclists would head out in capes and bobble hats in deepest winter, pushing their bikes through snowdrifts, forging frozen streams and even winching down the odd rock face. Sometimes women were on the back of their husband\u2019s tandem; often they were leading the pack. Slip-ons are not up to the job during the Kidderminster Cyclists\u2019 Touring Club\u2019s annual run to \u2018paradise\u2019 Crossing Maize Beck in the Pennines, Easter 1966 A cyclist takes a tumble in the Lake District, December 1986 A group poses for pictures outside the Blue Boar in Chipping Norton, Easter 1959 These were the days before Lycra, Gore-Tex, wicking fabrics and aero helmets. It would be decades before the advent of the mountain bike, before carbon fibre and hydraulic suspension, dropper seat posts and disc brakes. Steel was king and frames should be sturdy, rather than light. The club was the brainchild of Bill Paul from Liverpool. In 1954, he sent a letter to the Bicycle and Cycling magazines calling for other Rough-Stuff enthusiasts to join him in a fellowship. As a result, on Whit Sunday on 29 May 1955, about 40 cyclists presented themselves at the Black Swan hotel in Leominster, near the English border with Wales, for the first meeting A cyclist shows examines his bent wheel. They were able to fix it and continue their journey; crossing a stream on Corrie Coillie, Scotland 1959 A couple make friends with a horse during their bike ride, May 1959; cyclists enjoy a well-deserved rest in May 1959 A selection of snapshots taking during a ride in Norway, March 1973 By the first AGM in June, that number had swelled to what are now known as the \u201cfirst 90\u201d.

Centre for Future Work, an offshoot of the leftwing thinktank the Australia Institute, has warned that unions must not abandon political campaigns \u2013 in part because the Coalition \u201cmay now try to shift labour policies even further in favour of employers\u201d.</p> <p>In a briefing note, released on Thursday, director Jim Stanford argued that better labour market rules and union organising efforts were \u201ctwo sides of the same coin\u201d, implicitly refuting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/23/vanity-project-critics-round-on-actus-25m-campaign-after-labors-election-loss\">claims unions should abandon political campaigns</a> after the $25m Change the Rules campaign failed to eject the Morrison government.</p> <p>Critics of the campaign, including former ACTU assistant secretary Tim Lyons and National Union of Workers national secretary Tim Kennedy, have warned the movement should not become the \u201ccampaigning arm\u201d of Labor but rather focus on organising workplaces.</p> <p>The ACTU has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/24/actu-launches-review-of-25m-election-campaign-after-labor-defeat\">launched a review</a> of the campaign, with McManus promising to recalibrate if necessary but not to abandon the field of political campaigning.</p> <p>Stanford defended the unions\u2019 campaign, arguing it lifted support for increasing the minimum wage and limiting the spread of insecure work, and even contributed to the Coalition pledging to combat systemic underpayment.</p> <p>Stanford\u2019s paper cited the fact that strong majorities \u2013 of more than 70% in some cases \u2013 support restoring penalty rates and lifting the minimum wage, suggesting that public pressure has contributed to the Fair Work Commission lifting the minimum wage by a total of 10% over the last three years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

on union membership, with just 14.5% of workers in trade unions.</p> <p>While some countries, such as France, have strong labour rights despite low union density, there are none with union density of more than 20% without strong protections for workers\u2019 rights.</p> <p>\u201cThe international evidence is clear that eventually winning changes in the rules of the labour market \u2026 will be essential, as a complement (not a substitute) for unions\u2019 continuing efforts to expand membership, extend collective bargaining, and lift wages,\u201d it concluded.</p> <p>Stanford said that Australia\u2019s legal framework is \u201cvery hostile to unions and collective bargaining\u201d, citing the shift to enterprise bargaining in the early 1990s and Howard-era restrictions on industrial activity.</p> <p>\u201cPeople who say the rules are what they are \u2013 in the short term they\u2019re correct but in the long term unions in Australia still have to keep trying to achieve a more balanced legal climate or they will never break out of this box.\u201d</p> <p>Stanford told Guardian Australia the viability of the collective bargaining system is \u201cin doubt\u201d because 35% of employees are covered by enterprise agreements but only 14% pay union dues.</p> <p>\u201cYou have a situation where free riding is guaranteed by law and protected by law \u2013 it\u2019s almost celebrated by law.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fundamentally unviable to offer a service you\u2019re required to give to anyone and they\u2019re not required to pay for it.\u201d</p> <p>Although the Change the Rules campaign did not argue for the introduction of compulsory bargaining fees or a return of the closed shop, Stanford said it had argued for \u201cincremental improvements\u201d, such as allowing multi-employer bargaining.</p>",

The controversial union boss has faced calls to quit over claims he denigrated Rosie Batty in a union meeting, which he and one witness have since denied. He will also front court later this month over a harassment case and has said he will plead guilty. Asked whether it was the alleged Batty comments or the court case that had prompted McManus to call for his resignation, she said it was \u201cunrelated to Rosie Batty\u201d and based \u201ca whole range of issues\u201d. She said she could not comment on the court case. Earlier, it emerged the Coalition is preparing to use the Setka from the Labor party to pressure the Senate to pass laws further punishing unions for breaching laws that restrict industrial action. The move comes as a new paper from the Centre for Future Work argues unions should not abandon political campaigns because rebuilding membership will not be possible without laws granting stronger labour rights. On Wednesday senior frontbencher Angus Taylor confirmed the government was still \u201cabsolutely committed\u201d to passing the ensuring integrity bill which would allow the federal court to disqualify union officials and deregister unions for serious or repeated law breaches. McManus seized on Taylor\u2019s comments to tell Setka it was \u201cclear [the Coalition] will trying and exploit the situation for their own ends\u201d. Also on Thursday the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, hit back at Setka, the Victorian construction secretary of the Construction Forestry Maritime Mining and Energy Union, who has stared down calls to resign over claims he had criticised anti-domestic violence advocate Rosie Batty. Albanese said Setka\u2019s views were \u201cincompatible\u201d with the Labor party and mainstream Australia, and highlighted inconsistencies with the version of events provided by Maritime Union of Australia official Chris Cain, who claims Setka had not even mentioned Batty in a union meeting last week. Setka said on Wednesday that suggestions he \u201cdenigrated\u201d Batty were \u201cfabricated\u201d. \u201cI have always been a huge supporter of Rosie Batty and admired the tireless work she has done and what she has achieved,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just disgraceful for people to imply that \u2026 I am actually offended and it\u2019s vile.\u201d Despite his criticism of Setka, Albanese told Radio National that Australians were \u201csick of the government attacking trade unions\u201d, signalling that Labor will continue to oppose the ensuring integrity bill. The bill is supported by One Nation and Cory Bernardi, meaning that Centre Alliance and Jacqui Lambie are likely to have the casting votes when it is reintroduced to parliament. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The director of the Centre for Future Work, an offshoot of the leftwing thinktank the Australia Institute, has warned that unions must not abandon political campaigns \u2013 in part because the Coalition \u201cmay now try to shift labour policies even further in favour of employers\u201d. In a briefing note, released on Thursday, director Jim Stanford argued that better labour market rules and union organising efforts were \u201ctwo sides of the same coin\u201d, implicitly refuting claims unions should abandon political campaigns after the $25m Change the Rules campaign failed to eject the Morrison government. Critics of the campaign, including former ACTU assistant secretary Tim Lyons and National Union of Workers national secretary Tim Kennedy, have warned the movement should not become the \u201ccampaigning arm\u201d of Labor but rather focus on organising workplaces. The ACTU has launched a review of the campaign, with McManus promising to recalibrate if necessary but not to abandon the field of political campaigning. Stanford defended the unions\u2019 campaign, arguing it lifted support for increasing the minimum wage and limiting the spread of insecure work, and even contributed to the Coalition pledging to combat systemic underpayment. Stanford\u2019s paper cited the fact that strong majorities \u2013 of more than 70% in some cases \u2013 support restoring penalty rates and lifting the minimum wage, suggesting that public pressure has contributed to the Fair Work Commission lifting the minimum wage by a total of 10% over the last three years. It noted that Australia ranks 22nd \u2013 fifth last in the OECD \u2013 on labour rights, according to the World Economic Forum, and 20th on union membership, with just 14.5% of workers in trade unions. While some countries, such as France, have strong labour rights despite low union density, there are none with union density of more than 20% without strong protections for workers\u2019 rights. \u201cThe international evidence is clear that eventually winning changes in the rules of the labour market \u2026 will be essential, as a complement (not a substitute) for unions\u2019 continuing efforts to expand membership, extend collective bargaining, and lift wages,\u201d it concluded. Stanford said that Australia\u2019s legal framework is \u201cvery hostile to unions and collective bargaining\u201d, citing the shift to enterprise bargaining in the early 1990s and Howard-era restrictions on industrial activity. \u201cPeople who say the rules are what they are \u2013 in the short term they\u2019re correct but in the long term unions in Australia still have to keep trying to achieve a more balanced legal climate or they will never break out of this box.\u201d Stanford told Guardian Australia the viability of the collective bargaining system is \u201cin doubt\u201d because 35% of employees are covered by enterprise agreements but only 14% pay union dues. \u201cYou have a situation where free riding is guaranteed by law and protected by law \u2013 it\u2019s almost celebrated by law. \u201cIt\u2019s fundamentally unviable to offer a service you\u2019re required to give to anyone and they\u2019re not required to pay for it.\u201d Although the Change the Rules campaign did not argue for the introduction of compulsory bargaining fees or a return of the closed shop, Stanford said it had argued for \u201cincremental improvements\u201d, such as allowing multi-employer bargaining.",

On Thursday morning only a handful of people remained on the streets but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/13/hong-kong-protests-extradition-carrie-lam-riot-police\">protesters were restocking on supplies of water, helmets and other protective equipment</a>. Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, who is championing the proposed law, condemned protesters for \u201cdangerous and life-threatening acts\u201d, and likened them to errant children. \u201cI have two sons \u2026 if I let him have his way every time my son acted like that, such as when he didn\u2019t want to study, things might be OK between us in the short term. But if I indulge his wayward behaviour, he might regret it when he grows up. He will then ask me: \u2018Mum, why didn\u2019t you call me up on that back then?\u2019\u201d Governments of other countries have said they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/13/global-reaction-hong-kong-protest-rights-trump-may\">support Hong Kong people\u2019s right to protest</a>.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Crashing out one step closer \u2013 </strong>Members of parliament opposing a no-deal Brexit have been handed a setback after Labour\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/12/keir-starmer-urges-mps-to-back-safety-valve-to-stop-no-deal-brexit\">attempt to tie the next PM\u2019s hands failed in the Commons</a>.

In the Conservative leadership race, Tory MPs will today take part in the first of several rounds of voting that will eventually produce two finalists to be put to party members. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, at 40 the youngest candidate, has said he can \u201cturn the page\u201d on Brexit and would seek to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/12/matt-hancock-i-can-beat-corbyn-by-turning-page-on-brexit\">negotiate a time limit to the Irish border backstop</a>. And Boris Johnson has apologised for the gaffes that have characterised his political career, but said the public felt alienated from politicians because \u201ctoo often we are muffling and veiling our language \u2026 when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/12/brexit-delay-means-defeat-boris-johnson-launches-campaign\">what they want to hear is what we really think</a>\u201d.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Buyers could have helped themselves \u2013 </strong>More than half of people using the government\u2019s help-to-buy loan scheme could have bought a home without it, the National Audit Office has found. The scheme has led to as few as 78,000 additional sales of new-build properties since 2013. About 211,000 loans worth \u00a311.7bn were made to house buyers over the past five years, and the NAO says the scheme has achieved its goals of increasing home ownership and the construction of new homes. But about a fifth of people using the scheme already own property, and it is not means tested. More than 8,000 people who benefited from it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/13/nao-says-60-of-help-to-buy-buyers-did-not-need-state-support\">had household incomes of more than \u00a3100,000</a>. The scheme, introduced by George Osborne, has proven controversial as housebuilders\u2019 profits have dramatically increased since its introduction, benefiting company bosses and shareholders.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>UK lagging on maternity leave \u2013 </strong>Britain is among the least family-friendly of the world\u2019s richest countries, according to a Unicef assessment of child care and parental leave. Estonia offers women 85 weeks\u2019 maternity leave at full pay after having a baby. By contrast, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jun/13/parental-leave-uk-among-least-family-friendly-countries-oecd-survey\">the UK ranks 31st out of 41 countries in the OECD</a> with six weeks at 90% of pay and 33 weeks at a lower rate. When only considering parental leave, people in the UK do well compared with parents in Japan, Australia and the US, the last of which offers zero parental leave as a norm. Research by the Trades Union Congress has found that only 1% of new parents in the UK are using shared parental leave, out of more than 900,000 who were eligible. Take-up remains poor because most fathers cannot afford to live off the \u00a3145 a week payment, the TUC said.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p><strong>Leaf off \u2013 </strong>Train delays caused by \u201cleaves on the line\u201d could become a thing of the past via a simple-sounding solution: spraying water on the rails whenever slippery conditions are detected. The system is one of 24 trials backed with almost \u00a38m of Department for Transport (DfT) funding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/13/hi-tech-solutions-mean-leaves-on-the-line-may-be-a-thing-of-the-past\">aiming to make the rail industry more efficient, greener and cleaner</a>. Other ideas include using cameras and artificial intelligence to map leaf-shedding trees that need cutting back; track inspections by drones; and special walls that can deflect as much train noise as barriers three times their height.</p> <h2>Today in Focus podcast: Private armies and secret deals</h2> <p>Luke Harding reports on how a close ally of Vladimir Putin is leading a push to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/jun/13/private-armies-secret-deals-russia-putin-drive-into-africa\">turn Africa into a strategic hub for Russia</a>.</p> <h2>Lunchtime read: \u2018Bread is practically sacred\u2019</h2> <p>\u201cMy parents\u2019 social life in Bosnia (and therefore their children\u2019s) regularly featured a bunch of their friends getting together for a lot of food and drinking and singing and laughing,\u201d writes Aleksandar Hemon, in a more than bite-sized reminiscence of family life. \u201cNobody would ever call that endeavour \u2018dinner\u2019 \u2013 the activity <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jun/13/bread-is-practically-sacred-how-the-taste-of-home-sustained-my-refugee-parents\">revolved around food, but could never be reduced to it</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"194704f9d2513ac837de173c372d8ba41be1b3a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/194704f9d2513ac837de173c372d8ba41be1b3a0/0_137_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Bosnian Serb boy roasts lamb and pig in the village of Vojkovici, near Sarajevo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Bosnian Serb boy roasts lamb and pig in the village of Vojkovici, near Sarajevo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dado Ruvic/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIn my family, food is part of a complex system of knowledge that has its own hierarchy of value, wherein meat and bread are at the top.

And with Democrats like Sanders, Warren, Beto O\u2019Rourke and Kamala Harris lining up to deny Trump a second term in the White House, here is where they and others stand on key issues like the climate emergency, gun control and impeachment. * * * Protesters quiet but ready \u2013 Hong Kong\u2019s legislature has been suspended and government offices will remain closed for the week after the extradition bill protests. On Thursday morning only a handful of people remained on the streets but protesters were restocking on supplies of water, helmets and other protective equipment. Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, who is championing the proposed law, condemned protesters for \u201cdangerous and life-threatening acts\u201d, and likened them to errant children. \u201cI have two sons \u2026 if I let him have his way every time my son acted like that, such as when he didn\u2019t want to study, things might be OK between us in the short term. But if I indulge his wayward behaviour, he might regret it when he grows up. He will then ask me: \u2018Mum, why didn\u2019t you call me up on that back then?\u2019\u201d Governments of other countries have said they support Hong Kong people\u2019s right to protest. * * * Crashing out one step closer \u2013 Members of parliament opposing a no-deal Brexit have been handed a setback after Labour\u2019s attempt to tie the next PM\u2019s hands failed in the Commons. If a hard Brexit is what the next prime minister wants, there is little left short of bringing down the government to stop it happening, Heather Stewart says. In the Conservative leadership race, Tory MPs will today take part in the first of several rounds of voting that will eventually produce two finalists to be put to party members. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, at 40 the youngest candidate, has said he can \u201cturn the page\u201d on Brexit and would seek to negotiate a time limit to the Irish border backstop. And Boris Johnson has apologised for the gaffes that have characterised his political career, but said the public felt alienated from politicians because \u201ctoo often we are muffling and veiling our language \u2026 when what they want to hear is what we really think\u201d. * * * Buyers could have helped themselves \u2013 More than half of people using the government\u2019s help-to-buy loan scheme could have bought a home without it, the National Audit Office has found. The scheme has led to as few as 78,000 additional sales of new-build properties since 2013. About 211,000 loans worth \u00a311.7bn were made to house buyers over the past five years, and the NAO says the scheme has achieved its goals of increasing home ownership and the construction of new homes. But about a fifth of people using the scheme already own property, and it is not means tested. More than 8,000 people who benefited from it had household incomes of more than \u00a3100,000. The scheme, introduced by George Osborne, has proven controversial as housebuilders\u2019 profits have dramatically increased since its introduction, benefiting company bosses and shareholders. * * * UK lagging on maternity leave \u2013 Britain is among the least family-friendly of the world\u2019s richest countries, according to a Unicef assessment of child care and parental leave. Estonia offers women 85 weeks\u2019 maternity leave at full pay after having a baby. By contrast, the UK ranks 31st out of 41 countries in the OECD with six weeks at 90% of pay and 33 weeks at a lower rate. When only considering parental leave, people in the UK do well compared with parents in Japan, Australia and the US, the last of which offers zero parental leave as a norm. Research by the Trades Union Congress has found that only 1% of new parents in the UK are using shared parental leave, out of more than 900,000 who were eligible. Take-up remains poor because most fathers cannot afford to live off the \u00a3145 a week payment, the TUC said. * * * Leaf off \u2013 Train delays caused by \u201cleaves on the line\u201d could become a thing of the past via a simple-sounding solution: spraying water on the rails whenever slippery conditions are detected. The system is one of 24 trials backed with almost \u00a38m of Department for Transport (DfT) funding aiming to make the rail industry more efficient, greener and cleaner. Other ideas include using cameras and artificial intelligence to map leaf-shedding trees that need cutting back; track inspections by drones; and special walls that can deflect as much train noise as barriers three times their height. Today in Focus podcast: Private armies and secret deals Luke Harding reports on how a close ally of Vladimir Putin is leading a push to turn Africa into a strategic hub for Russia. Lunchtime read: \u2018Bread is practically sacred\u2019 \u201cMy parents\u2019 social life in Bosnia (and therefore their children\u2019s) regularly featured a bunch of their friends getting together for a lot of food and drinking and singing and laughing,\u201d writes Aleksandar Hemon, in a more than bite-sized reminiscence of family life. \u201cNobody would ever call that endeavour \u2018dinner\u2019 \u2013 the activity revolved around food, but could never be reduced to it. \u201cIn my family, food is part of a complex system of knowledge that has its own hierarchy of value, wherein meat and bread are at the top. Meat is appreciated in all its variations: cuts, smoked meat, sausage, spit-roasted. After more than 20 years in displacement, my parents have assembled a life, nutritional and otherwise, that aimed to be a restorative replica of the previous one. They eat everything they would have been eating if they had stayed in Bosnia, even if it can be hard work to get all the stuff.\u201d Sport Chris Froome is out of the Tour de France after sustaining \u201cmultiple serious injuries\u201d in a freak high-speed accident. The Team Ineos rider and four-times champion, who is in intensive care, broke a leg, ribs and an elbow after colliding with a wall outside the town of Roanne in the Loire. Eug\u00e9nie Le Sommer held her nerve to score a VAR-awarded penalty winner for France after Wendie Renard had potentially gifted Norway a vital point in the race to top Women\u2019s World Cup Group A, while Sara D\u00e4britz scored the only goal of the game as Germany beat Spain 1-0 and Nigeria took their chances against the run of play to beat South Korea. Michael Holding has hit back at \u201ccensorship\u201d by the ICC following a request to tone down his views on umpiring while commentating on the Cricket World Cup. David Warner\u2019s century and mad axeman\u2019s charge lit up a fine game between Australia and Pakistan in Taunton but the World Cup has not been designed to thrill, writes Matthew Engel. Norwich have capped ticket prices at \u00a330 on their return to the top flight, reviving the issue of accessible pricing for fans in the Premier League. And the long-running legal case in which Megan McCann, a student from Northern Ireland, was suing the bookmaker Bet365 for \u00a31m in unpaid winnings has been discontinued shortly before it was due to return to court. Business Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia group has avoided the ignominy of going into administration after landlords backed the fashion company\u2019s plans for a restructuring. It means up to 1,000 jobs could be lost as 50 stores are closed to cut losses. Mass protests in Hong Kong have pushed the Hang Seng index lower by 1.5% after similar falls on Wednesday. Asian stocks were generally down as gloom about the US-China trade dispute continued to cast a shadow over markets. The FTSE100 is expected to fall slightly at the open. Sterling is struggling at $1.268 and \u20ac1.123. The papers The Express says a failed Labour-led attempt to pass a motion ruling out a no-deal Brexit is a \u201cVictory for Brexit\u201d. The Guardian has the same story on its front: \u201cLabour defeat hands boost to hard Brexit candidates\u201d. The Times reports on Boris Johnson, saying: \u201cJohnson \u2018won\u2019t rule out suspending parliament\u2019\u201d to force through no-deal Brexit, whereas the FT says \u201cJohnson eases no-deal rhetoric as leak warns Britain is unprepared\u201d. The Telegraph dedicates serious front page space to the launch of Boris Johnson\u2019s campaign for the top job, with its headline a quote from Johnson: \u201c\u2018Now is the time to remember our duty to the people\u2019\u201d. The Mirror also leads on Johnson\u2019s leadership bid launch, but focuses on how Johnson \u201cducked questions\u201d about his cocaine use, with the headline: \u201cWho\u2019s a snorty boy!\u201d The i focuses on another Tory leadership contender: \u201cIncompetent Tories not up to the job, admits Javid\u201d. The Mail does have Johnson\u2019s launch on its front, weirdly fixating on the question of \u201chow did his young girlfriend tame him\u201d for the launch, but its lead story is: \u201cVictory on post offices\u201d after a Mail campaign to increase pay rates for postmasters. The Sun\u2019s lead story is about comedian Jo Brand who made comments that protesters should throw acid, not milkshakes, at Nigel Farage: \u201cJo\u2019s acid tongue\u201d.

It crosses the Kintyre peninsula, saving boats from the long and occasionally dangerous trip around the Mull of Kintyre, and the prospect of dicing with the <a href=\"https://whirlpool-scotland.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Corryvreckan whirlpool</a>. The canal is nine miles long, cutting across country from Ardrishaig in the east to Crinan in the west. The towpath is in great condition, making for easy cycling or walking. The <a href=\"https://www.crinanhotel.com/\" title=\"\">Crinan Hotel</a> is a great place to end up, and a bowl of seafood stew outside its bar, looking out to Islay and Jura makes an unforgettable lunch. <br>\u2022 <em><a href=\"https://www.scottishcanals.co.uk/canals/crinan-canal/\" title=\"\">scottishcanals.co.uk</a></em><br><strong>Michael Mooney</strong></p> \n<h2>Limehouse to Camden Town Brewery, London</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"144884958489b5685641a4a873492c35c6750ce5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/144884958489b5685641a4a873492c35c6750ce5/0_235_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Crate Brewery.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Crate Brewery.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On this 15-mile walk you\u2019ll see alternative living on London canals, friendly folks, parks and, most importantly, lots of pubs!

The most dramatic stretch, possibly the closest we have to a rainforest in this country, is <a href=\"https://walkpeakdistrict.com/chee-dale/\" title=\"\">Chee Dale</a>. It\u2019s not an easy route, with some scrambling over rocks and places where the valley is so narrow you need to use stepping stones alongside the river \u2013 and it\u2019s impassable after heavy rain. Wyedale or Topley Pike car parks are good starting points (there are also buses; the 65 and 66 from Buxton pass by Topley Pike), and the riverside <a href=\"http://www.anglersrestmillersdale.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Angler\u2019s Rest</a> at Miller\u2019s Dale is a beautifully located refreshment stop.

The route is named after the Templer family, who built a tramway and the Stover Canal to carry granite off the moors to the port. The final stage (of six miles) takes walkers from Newton Abbot Town Quay via Coombe Cellars along the River Teign Estuary to Shaldon. Once in the village, you can pick up the passenger ferry to Teignmouth and enjoy the sunset over Dartmoor from the back beach. This section along the river is dependent on the tide.

      "bodyText": "Winning tip: Crinan Canal, Argyll and Bute The Crinan Canal is known as \u201cBritain\u2019s most scenic shortcut\u201d. It crosses the Kintyre peninsula, saving boats from the long and occasionally dangerous trip around the Mull of Kintyre, and the prospect of dicing with the Corryvreckan whirlpool. The canal is nine miles long, cutting across country from Ardrishaig in the east to Crinan in the west. The towpath is in great condition, making for easy cycling or walking. The Crinan Hotel is a great place to end up, and a bowl of seafood stew outside its bar, looking out to Islay and Jura makes an unforgettable lunch. \u2022 scottishcanals.co.uk Michael Mooney Limehouse to Camden Town Brewery, London On this 15-mile walk you\u2019ll see alternative living on London canals, friendly folks, parks and, most importantly, lots of pubs! Start at The Grapes, close to Limehouse Basin Marina, wander for a mile and half up the Regent\u2019s Canal to the Palm Tree at Mile End, then east along the Hertford Union for a mile or so to the Crate Brewery at Hackney Wick. Stop there for lots of great bars and pizza or carry on a short way up the River Lea to the Four Quarters . Then comes the Princess of Wales in Clapton and, on past Tottenham Marshes for six miles is Camden Town Brewery in Enfield (nearest station Ponders End), on a reservoir. Get chatting to people on passing boats and maybe get a ride. A very good escape for any Londoner and a brilliant alternative for tourists. Rachael River Wye and Chee Dale, Derbyshire The Wye in Derbyshire passes through one of the loveliest valleys in England and offers many brilliant routes. The most dramatic stretch, possibly the closest we have to a rainforest in this country, is Chee Dale. It\u2019s not an easy route, with some scrambling over rocks and places where the valley is so narrow you need to use stepping stones alongside the river \u2013 and it\u2019s impassable after heavy rain. Wyedale or Topley Pike car parks are good starting points (there are also buses; the 65 and 66 from Buxton pass by Topley Pike), and the riverside Angler\u2019s Rest at Miller\u2019s Dale is a beautifully located refreshment stop. For a simpler route back to the start, follow the Monsal Trail above the river and through tunnels, passing lots of interesting industrial relics. About five miles in total. \u2022 walkpeakdistrict.com Graham Dean Templer Way, Stover Canal and River Teign, South Devon This stunning 18-mile (10-hour) route starts at Haytor on Dartmoor and finishes on the coast at Teignmouth via Newton Abbot. The route is named after the Templer family, who built a tramway and the Stover Canal to carry granite off the moors to the port. The final stage (of six miles) takes walkers from Newton Abbot Town Quay via Coombe Cellars along the River Teign Estuary to Shaldon. Once in the village, you can pick up the passenger ferry to Teignmouth and enjoy the sunset over Dartmoor from the back beach. This section along the river is dependent on the tide. The estuary shore is full of interest, with a shellfish farm, an old lime kiln and lots of watercraft. \u2022 walkingenglishman.com Laura M Chichester to West Wittering, West Sussex Leaving Chichester station, head out of town along the quiet old ship canal. Mostly just moorhens for company and the sky reflecting off the glassy silent waterway. Crossing a road, skirt around the marina and walk on, past (or into) the lovely Ship pub at Itchenor. Then the route runs all along the natural beauty that is Chichester harbour to the vast sandy beaches of the Witterings. Eight miles of bliss. \u2022 my.viewranger.com Mark Ebdn Bowlees to Low Force, River Tees For an eight-mile river walk with everything, head for the Tees. Start at Bowlees visitor centre, diverting briefly north along Bow Lee Beck to check out Gibson\u2019s Cave and Summerhill Force waterfall. Cross the Tees at Newbiggin and have lunch at the Strathmore Arms in Holwick, the sort of cosy, hidden pub you thought no longer existed. Cross boggy moorland including two sets of stepping stones to a viewpoint looking down the Tees (ignore the quarry). You\u2019re soon right beside the river and ready for the grand finale: the thundering High Force then Low Force with a suspension bridge used by Victorian lead miners to finish. \u2022 my.viewranger.com Paul Kirkwood Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal The three- to four-mile walk between Pontymoile and Abergavenny runs through glorious countryside into the setting for Alexander Cordell\u2019s 19th-century family sagas. There are no roads, just wonderful countryside with the odd barge or cruiser puttering alongside you. There\u2019s the Green Flute Caf\u00e9 at Goytre Wharf, and several pubs within a short walk of the canal. This walk ends near Llanfoist with a 20-minute walk into Abergavenny. Stay at the Angel Hotel (doubles from \u00a395 B&amp;B), or just relax in the hotel\u2019s bar with a pint and take the frequent bus service back to Pontymoile. Another great walk on the canal is the seven-mile stretch further north between Talybont-on-Usk and Brecon; again, return by bus. Gwyn Ilkley to Bolton Abbey, River Wharfe This is a six-mile walk along the glorious River Wharfe from Ilkley to Bolton Abbey with views of the Yorkshire dales. Start at Ilkley\u2019s Riverside Gardens on the south bank near the remains of a Roman fort. Follow the path west past the old stone bridge and along to attractive Addingham with its Low Mill weir and views of Castleberg fort. Continue to the 12th-century monastery of Bolton Abbey, which stands amid wonderful woods and parkland. There are lots of picnic spots here and the brave will want to try crossing the Wharfe via the 60 stepping stones once used by lay workers at the Priory. \u2022 gps-routes.co.uk Kevin Belfast to Lisburn, Lagan Navigation It\u2019s 11 miles and an easy four-hour walk from Belfast to Lisburn along the 18th-century Lagan Navigation towpath.

Very little of it stands up to close scrutiny in the realism department, but I don\u2019t think it was supposed to. It\u2019s just a bit of fun. For me, series two just settled back into laziness.

Still enjoying it but so far it\u2019s just a sequence of purposeless, and vaguely amusing events. Part of the problem is that there is not much new mystery. While the Eve vs Villanelle dynamic is what everyone focuses on, season one had a lot more going on around it. While the idea of The Ghost has been introduced, there\u2019s no tension in that concept \u2013 it\u2019s just an uncharismatic anti-Villanelle who no one seems to really care about. So a new psychopathic assassin on the loose is almost an irrelevance.

The three leads are all great, and there have been some enjoyable cameos from the likes of Zoe Wanamaker, Adeel Akhtar, Nickolas Grace and Barbara Flynn. The main reason I love Killing Eve so much is to enjoy Jodie Comer\u2019s performance in what I suspect will be the breakthrough to huge success. She was very good in an underwritten role as the \u2018other woman\u2019 in Doctor Foster - which let\u2019s face it was all about Suranne Jones - but that gave no clue that Comer could be as versatile, charismatic and generally brilliant as this.

      "body": "<p>The most popular picture books published in 2018 collectively present a white and male-dominated world to children, feature very few BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) characters and have become more biased against girls in the past year, Guardian research reveals.</p> \n<p>In-depth analysis of the top 100 bestselling illustrated children\u2019s books of 2018, using data from Nielsen BookScan, has been carried out by the Guardian and Observer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/21/childrens-books-sexism-monster-in-your-kids-book-is-male\">for the second year in a row</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9aa06e70-ab92-47ef-8587-a17710f2d8c4\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In the top 100 books* of 2018, <b>41%</b> of characters were female, while <b>59%</b> were male.

The only BAME boy named in the top 100 is Toto, a character in Roald Dahl's 1978 classic The Enormous Crocodile.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>* Collections of small board books for toddlers were removed from the analysis.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It shows that only five bestsellers feature a BAME character in a central role, with three of those being just one character: Lanky Len, the nasty mixed-race burglar in Julia Donaldson and Lydia Monks\u2019 series What the Ladybird Heard.</p> \n<p>Male characters continue to dominate the most popular picture books: a child is 1.6 times more likely to read one with a male rather than a female lead, and seven times more likely to read a story that has a male villain in it than a female baddie. Male characters outnumbered female characters in more than half the books, while females outnumber males less than a fifth of the time.</p> \n<p>A quarter of the books portrayed only white people, while almost 70% of the books with illustrations of BAME characters featured them only in non-speaking roles. Just two of 2018\u2019s bestsellers \u2013 You Choose by Pippa Goodhart, illustrated by Nick Sharratt, and The Girl, the Bear and the Magic Shoes by Donaldson, illustrated by Monks \u2013 showed BAME girls in central roles. Only seven books feature BAME characters important enough to the story to be referred to by name.</p> \n<p>When bestsellers did include characters who were female or from BAME backgrounds, they were much less likely to speak than white, male characters. Only 11 characters of colour were given speaking parts across all the 100 books and just 79 female characters mentioned in the texts also spoke, compared with 149 male characters. Speaking roles for male characters rose by 19% over the previous year, while one in five bestsellers did not feature any females at all.</p> \n<p>Despite this dominance of male characters, not a single bestseller features a BAME male as its central character. The only black boy named in any of the books is Toto, a character in Roald Dahl\u2019s 1978 book The Enormous Crocodile.</p> \n<p>In total, more than a fifth of the sample were first published in the last century. All-male classics such as Dear Zoo and Guess How Much I Love You dominated the top 10 for yet another year, while beloved all-white masterpieces such as The Cat in the Hat and The Tiger Who Came to Tea continue outsell modern books.</p> \n<p>But newer picture books are increasingly breaking into the top 100: 22 of the bestsellers were published in the previous 12 months, a significant 29% increase on 2017. However, only 41% of characters in the texts were identified as female, while 59% were male \u2013 exactly the same proportion as in 2017, when fewer modern books featured in the list.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s really disappointing to see that things are getting worse, rather than better, and that newer books aren\u2019t helping to make our kids\u2019 bookshelves more balanced,\u201d said Jess Day, from the gender equality campaign Let Toys Be Toys. \u201cWhat we tell very young children has a strong influence - and what they\u2019re seeing in books is a world where male is the default, male voices dominate and BAME characters are rarely at the centre of the story.\u201d</p> \n<p>No same-sex families were portrayed in the books and Donaldson\u2019s The Everywhere Bear, illustrated by Rebecca Cobb, is the only book which depicts a disabled child. She is white and does not speak or play a key role in the story.</p> \n<p>The lack of diversity displayed in the books reflects a lack of diversity among the authors and illustrators themselves: not a single author or illustrator of a bestselling picture book was identified as BAME by the Guardian. Around two-thirds of the bestselling authors (65%) and illustrators (67%) were male.</p> \n<p>These numbers reflect earlier research by the BookTrust, which found a severe lack of BAME illustrators of children\u2019s books: more than 94% are currently white, and less than 2% are British people of colour.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhile there is lots of positive work happening to help level the playing field, there is still a long way to go,\u201d said Jill Coleman, director of children\u2019s books at BookTrust, which recently launched a <a href=\"https://www.booktrust.org.uk/what-we-do/programmes-and-campaigns/booktrust-represents/\">three-year programme</a> to support and subsidise BAME children\u2019s authors and illustrators. \u201cChildren need and deserve to see themselves in books, and to have access to a rich and diverse range of voices.\u201d</p> \n<p>Emma House, deputy chief executive of the Publishers Association, called the results \u201chighly concerning\u201d and said that publishers had to \u201crecognise their responsibility to reflect society and enrich the lives of all children through books\u201d. While diversity initiatives were looking promising, \u201cit will take time for these changes to permeate bestseller lists\u201d, she said.</p> \n<p>In analysis revealed last year, the Centre for Literacy in Primary Education (CLPE) found that of the 9,115 children\u2019s books published in 2017, just 1% featured a BAME main character, while 96% depicted no BAME characters at all.</p> \n<p>Charlotte Hacking of CLPE said that the perception among publishers that books with diverse casts don\u2019t sell had created the bias towards white characters. \u201cIt\u2019s a self-fulfilling prophecy,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Hacking called on publishers to increase the marketing for books with diverse casts so the bestseller list would more accurately reflect the diversity of modern Britain. Around a third of schoolchildren in England are from black or ethnic minority backgrounds, <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/719226/Schools_Pupils_and_their_Characteristics_2018_Main_Text.pdf\">according to the Department of Education</a>, and 48% are female, according to the <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/populationestimatesforukenglandandwalesscotlandandnorthernireland\">ONS</a>.</p> \n<p>Kate Pankhurst, author and illustrator of the Fantastically Great Women series of picture books, said that authors and illustrators had a duty to include diverse characters to avoid imparting the message that only certain people have agency and leadership qualities.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have to question why that is seen as acceptable, when it isn\u2019t,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p> <br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The most popular picture books published in 2018 collectively present a white and male-dominated world to children, feature very few BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) characters and have become more biased against girls in the past year, Guardian research reveals. In-depth analysis of the top 100 bestselling illustrated children\u2019s books of 2018, using data from Nielsen BookScan, has been carried out by the Guardian and Observer for the second year in a row. It shows that only five bestsellers feature a BAME character in a central role, with three of those being just one character: Lanky Len, the nasty mixed-race burglar in Julia Donaldson and Lydia Monks\u2019 series What the Ladybird Heard. Male characters continue to dominate the most popular picture books: a child is 1.6 times more likely to read one with a male rather than a female lead, and seven times more likely to read a story that has a male villain in it than a female baddie. Male characters outnumbered female characters in more than half the books, while females outnumber males less than a fifth of the time. A quarter of the books portrayed only white people, while almost 70% of the books with illustrations of BAME characters featured them only in non-speaking roles. Just two of 2018\u2019s bestsellers \u2013 You Choose by Pippa Goodhart, illustrated by Nick Sharratt, and The Girl, the Bear and the Magic Shoes by Donaldson, illustrated by Monks \u2013 showed BAME girls in central roles. Only seven books feature BAME characters important enough to the story to be referred to by name. When bestsellers did include characters who were female or from BAME backgrounds, they were much less likely to speak than white, male characters. Only 11 characters of colour were given speaking parts across all the 100 books and just 79 female characters mentioned in the texts also spoke, compared with 149 male characters. Speaking roles for male characters rose by 19% over the previous year, while one in five bestsellers did not feature any females at all. Despite this dominance of male characters, not a single bestseller features a BAME male as its central character. The only black boy named in any of the books is Toto, a character in Roald Dahl\u2019s 1978 book The Enormous Crocodile. In total, more than a fifth of the sample were first published in the last century. All-male classics such as Dear Zoo and Guess How Much I Love You dominated the top 10 for yet another year, while beloved all-white masterpieces such as The Cat in the Hat and The Tiger Who Came to Tea continue outsell modern books. But newer picture books are increasingly breaking into the top 100: 22 of the bestsellers were published in the previous 12 months, a significant 29% increase on 2017. However, only 41% of characters in the texts were identified as female, while 59% were male \u2013 exactly the same proportion as in 2017, when fewer modern books featured in the list. \u201cIt\u2019s really disappointing to see that things are getting worse, rather than better, and that newer books aren\u2019t helping to make our kids\u2019 bookshelves more balanced,\u201d said Jess Day, from the gender equality campaign Let Toys Be Toys. \u201cWhat we tell very young children has a strong influence - and what they\u2019re seeing in books is a world where male is the default, male voices dominate and BAME characters are rarely at the centre of the story.\u201d No same-sex families were portrayed in the books and Donaldson\u2019s The Everywhere Bear, illustrated by Rebecca Cobb, is the only book which depicts a disabled child. She is white and does not speak or play a key role in the story. The lack of diversity displayed in the books reflects a lack of diversity among the authors and illustrators themselves: not a single author or illustrator of a bestselling picture book was identified as BAME by the Guardian. Around two-thirds of the bestselling authors (65%) and illustrators (67%) were male. These numbers reflect earlier research by the BookTrust, which found a severe lack of BAME illustrators of children\u2019s books: more than 94% are currently white, and less than 2% are British people of colour. \u201cWhile there is lots of positive work happening to help level the playing field, there is still a long way to go,\u201d said Jill Coleman, director of children\u2019s books at BookTrust, which recently launched a three-year programme to support and subsidise BAME children\u2019s authors and illustrators. \u201cChildren need and deserve to see themselves in books, and to have access to a rich and diverse range of voices.\u201d Emma House, deputy chief executive of the Publishers Association, called the results \u201chighly concerning\u201d and said that publishers had to \u201crecognise their responsibility to reflect society and enrich the lives of all children through books\u201d. While diversity initiatives were looking promising, \u201cit will take time for these changes to permeate bestseller lists\u201d, she said. In analysis revealed last year, the Centre for Literacy in Primary Education (CLPE) found that of the 9,115 children\u2019s books published in 2017, just 1% featured a BAME main character, while 96% depicted no BAME characters at all. Charlotte Hacking of CLPE said that the perception among publishers that books with diverse casts don\u2019t sell had created the bias towards white characters. \u201cIt\u2019s a self-fulfilling prophecy,\u201d she said. Hacking called on publishers to increase the marketing for books with diverse casts so the bestseller list would more accurately reflect the diversity of modern Britain. Around a third of schoolchildren in England are from black or ethnic minority backgrounds, according to the Department of Education, and 48% are female, according to the ONS. Kate Pankhurst, author and illustrator of the Fantastically Great Women series of picture books, said that authors and illustrators had a duty to include diverse characters to avoid imparting the message that only certain people have agency and leadership qualities. \u201cWe have to question why that is seen as acceptable, when it isn\u2019t,\u201d she said.",

When Welsh does make the headlines, it tends to be in the context of English visitors complaining about restaurant staff and pub clientele speaking it, as though people speaking their own language in their own country were a deliberate act of rudeness. So when Alffa, two teenage rock musicians from rural Gwynedd, north Wales, passed <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/alffaband/\">1m plays on Spotify</a> with a Welsh language song, I\u2019ll admit I was very surprised.</p> <p>We Welsh speakers may live and breathe the language, but many people outside Britain are unaware it even exists.

We were like a minority within a minority. It was so odd.</p> <p>\u201cThey had this whole conception of the Eisteddfod being white Welsh middle class, and when I was saying \u2018dwi\u2019n siarad Cymraeg\u2019 [\u201cI speak Welsh\u201d] they were looking at me as if to say, \u2018How is that even possible?\u2019 Somalis have been here for over 200 years, and I\u2019m still getting these questions.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"60023296092b8842112566b27c772a7f11f45367\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60023296092b8842112566b27c772a7f11f45367/0_40_3811_2287/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Welsh language learner Mymuna Mohamood also speaks Somali, Arabic and English.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Welsh language learner Mymuna Mohamood also speaks Somali, Arabic and English.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ashley Crowden/Athena Pictures/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Expanding conceptions of what it means to be Welsh can only be a good thing, though there is clearly still much work to be done. As Mohamood notes, Welsh classes need to be affordable and accessible if the assembly is to reach its one million speakers target. As exciting as it is to see Welsh embraced for its cultural capital, as Rhys notes, that might not last for ever.</p> <p>\u201cI suppose the problem with notions of cool is that things become uncool, but any culture and language deserves its space to be uncool as well.\u201d Though the language now has an official role in public life, after much campaigning, the next step is securing it the same rights in the private sector and that is harder to regulate, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s very much at crisis point and it\u2019s crucial that multinational tech companies are able to [embrace it],\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s starting to happen in the EU, where [representation of minority languages] is regulated, but the fact that Alexa can\u2019t speak Welsh is a huge problem.\u201d </p> <p>Personally, I quite like the idea that Welsh could become a secret language of resistance against international tech companies. Beyond any ephemeral ideas of coolness, however, a true victory for the language would be that it is able to survive. My dad was right. Like the water we swim in, it\u2019s there and it\u2019s ours.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 13 June 2019 to correct the year in which the Tryweryn valley was flooded from 1956 to 1965.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Welsh speakers are not used to their language and their culture being perceived as interesting or cool. When Welsh does make the headlines, it tends to be in the context of English visitors complaining about restaurant staff and pub clientele speaking it, as though people speaking their own language in their own country were a deliberate act of rudeness. So when Alffa, two teenage rock musicians from rural Gwynedd, north Wales, passed 1m plays on Spotify with a Welsh language song, I\u2019ll admit I was very surprised. We Welsh speakers may live and breathe the language, but many people outside Britain are unaware it even exists. All my life, it has been in crisis \u2013 but change is in the air. The number of speakers has surged to 874,700 \u2013 up from 726,600 in 2008, according to the Office of National Statistics. The Welsh Assembly has set a goal of one million Welsh speakers by 2050 (the population of Wales is 3.1 million) and it\u2019s off to a good start.

It was so odd. \u201cThey had this whole conception of the Eisteddfod being white Welsh middle class, and when I was saying \u2018dwi\u2019n siarad Cymraeg\u2019 [\u201cI speak Welsh\u201d] they were looking at me as if to say, \u2018How is that even possible?\u2019 Somalis have been here for over 200 years, and I\u2019m still getting these questions.\u201d Expanding conceptions of what it means to be Welsh can only be a good thing, though there is clearly still much work to be done. As Mohamood notes, Welsh classes need to be affordable and accessible if the assembly is to reach its one million speakers target. As exciting as it is to see Welsh embraced for its cultural capital, as Rhys notes, that might not last for ever. \u201cI suppose the problem with notions of cool is that things become uncool, but any culture and language deserves its space to be uncool as well.\u201d Though the language now has an official role in public life, after much campaigning, the next step is securing it the same rights in the private sector and that is harder to regulate, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s very much at crisis point and it\u2019s crucial that multinational tech companies are able to [embrace it],\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s starting to happen in the EU, where [representation of minority languages] is regulated, but the fact that Alexa can\u2019t speak Welsh is a huge problem.\u201d Personally, I quite like the idea that Welsh could become a secret language of resistance against international tech companies. Beyond any ephemeral ideas of coolness, however, a true victory for the language would be that it is able to survive. My dad was right. Like the water we swim in, it\u2019s there and it\u2019s ours. \u2022 This article was amended on 13 June 2019 to correct the year in which the Tryweryn valley was flooded from 1956 to 1965.",

      "body": "<p>When my parents sent their saliva away to a genetic testing company late last year and were informed via email a few weeks later that they are both \u201c100% Ashkenazi Jewish\u201d, it struck me as slightly odd. Most people I know who have done DNA tests received ancestry results that correspond to geographical areas \u2013 Chinese, British, West African. Jewish, by comparison, is typically parsed as a religious or cultural identity. I wondered how this was traceable in my parents\u2019 DNA.</p> <p>After arriving in eastern Europe around a millennium ago, the company\u2019s website explained, Jewish communities remained segregated, by force and by custom, mixing only occasionally with local populations. Isolation slowly narrowed the gene pool, which now gives modern Jews of European descent, like my family, a set of identifiable genetic variations that set them apart from other European populations at a microscopic level.</p> <p>This genetic explanation of my Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry came as no surprise. According to family lore, my forebears lived in small towns and villages in eastern Europe for at least a few hundred years, where they kept their traditions and married within the community, up until the Holocaust, when they were either murdered or dispersed.</p> <p>But still, there was something disconcerting about our Jewishness being \u201cconfirmed\u201d by a biological test. After all, the reason my grandparents had to leave the towns and villages of their ancestors was because of ethno-nationalism emboldened by a racialized conception of Jewishness as something that exists \u201cin the blood\u201d.</p> <p>The raw memory of this racism made any suggestion of Jewish ethnicity slightly taboo in my family. If I ever mentioned that someone \u201clooked Jewish\u201d my grandmother would respond, \u201cOh really? And what exactly does a Jew look like?\u201d Yet evidently, this wariness of ethnic categorization didn\u2019t stop my parents from sending swab samples from the inside of their cheeks off to a direct-to-consumer genetic testing company. The idea of having an ancient identity \u201cconfirmed\u201d by modern science was too alluring.</p> <p>Not that they\u2019re alone. As of the beginning of this year, more than 26 million people have <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612880/more-than-26-million-people-have-taken-an-at-home-ancestry-test/\">taken</a> at-home DNA tests. For most, like my parents, genetic identity is assimilated into an existing life story with relative ease, while for others, the test can unearth family secrets or capsize personal narratives around ethnic heritage.</p> <p>But as these genetic databases grow, genetic identity is reshaping not only how we understand ourselves, but how we can be identified by others. In the past year, law enforcement has become increasingly adept at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/dec/01/how-home-dna-tests-are-solving-cold-cases-golden-state-killer\">using</a> genetic data to solve cold cases; a recent study shows that even if you haven\u2019t taken a test, chances are you can be identified by authorities via genealogical sleuthing.</p> <p>What is perhaps more concerning, though, is how authorities around the world are also beginning to use DNA to not only identify individuals, but to categorize and discriminate against entire groups of people.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"Break\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">Break</a> </figure>  <p><strong>In February of this year,</strong> the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-israeli-rabbinate-accused-of-using-dna-testing-to-prove-jewishness-1.6902132\">reported</a> that the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, the peak religious authority in the country, had been requesting DNA tests to confirm Jewishness before issuing some marriage licenses.</p> <p>In Israel, matrimonial law is religious, not civil. Jews can marry Jews, but intermarriage with Muslims or Christians is legally unacknowledged. This means that when a Jewish couple want to tie the knot, they are required by law to prove their Jewishness to the Rabbinate according to Orthodox tradition, which defines Jewish ancestry as being passed down through the mother.</p> <p>While for most Israeli Jews this simply involves handing over their mother\u2019s birth or marriage certificate, for many recent immigrants to Israel, who often come from communities where being Jewish is defined differently or documentation is scarce, producing evidence that satisfies the Rabbinate\u2019s standard of proof can be impossible.</p> <p>In the past, confirming Jewishness in the absence of documentation has involved contacting rabbis from the countries where people originate or tracking genealogical records back to prove religious continuity along the matrilineal line. But as was reported in Haaretz, and later <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Chief-Rabbinate-admits-using-DNA-tests-for-Jewish-status-determination-582605\">confirmed</a> by David Lau, the Ashkenazi chief rabbi of Israel, in the past year, the rabbis have been requesting that some people undergo a DNA test to verify their claim before being allowed to marry.</p> <p>For many Israelis, news that the rabbinical judges were turning to DNA testing was shocking, but for Seth Farber, an American-born Orthodox rabbi, it came as no surprise. Farber, who has been living in Israel since the 1990s, is the director of Itim, the Jewish Life Information Center, an organization that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/16/rabbis-block-marriages-israeljewish-identity-human-rights\">helps</a> Israeli Jews navigate state-administered matters of Jewish life, like marriage and conversion. In the past year, the organization has seen up to 50 cases where families have been asked to undergo DNA tests to certify their Jewishness.</p> <p>Those being asked to take these tests, Farber told me, are mostly Russian-speaking Israelis, members of an almost 1 million-strong immigrant community who began moving to Israel from countries of the former Soviet Union in the 1990s. Due to the fact that Jewish life was forcefully suppressed during the Soviet era, many members of this community lack the necessary documentation to prove Jewishness through matrilineal descent. This means that although most self-identify as Jewish, <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Israelis-to-protest-Rabbinates-usage-of-DNA-to-determine-Jewish-status-583152\">hundreds of thousands</a> are not considered so by the Rabbinate, and routinely have their Jewish status challenged when seeking religious services, including marriage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"Break\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">Break</a> </figure>  <p><strong>For almost two decades,</strong> Farber and his colleagues have advocated for this immigrant community in the face of what they see as targeted discrimination. In cases of marriage, Farber acts as a type of rabbinical lawyer, pulling together documentation and making a case for his clients in front of a board of rabbinical judges.

      "bodyText": "When my parents sent their saliva away to a genetic testing company late last year and were informed via email a few weeks later that they are both \u201c100% Ashkenazi Jewish\u201d, it struck me as slightly odd. Most people I know who have done DNA tests received ancestry results that correspond to geographical areas \u2013 Chinese, British, West African. Jewish, by comparison, is typically parsed as a religious or cultural identity. I wondered how this was traceable in my parents\u2019 DNA. After arriving in eastern Europe around a millennium ago, the company\u2019s website explained, Jewish communities remained segregated, by force and by custom, mixing only occasionally with local populations. Isolation slowly narrowed the gene pool, which now gives modern Jews of European descent, like my family, a set of identifiable genetic variations that set them apart from other European populations at a microscopic level. This genetic explanation of my Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry came as no surprise. According to family lore, my forebears lived in small towns and villages in eastern Europe for at least a few hundred years, where they kept their traditions and married within the community, up until the Holocaust, when they were either murdered or dispersed. But still, there was something disconcerting about our Jewishness being \u201cconfirmed\u201d by a biological test. After all, the reason my grandparents had to leave the towns and villages of their ancestors was because of ethno-nationalism emboldened by a racialized conception of Jewishness as something that exists \u201cin the blood\u201d. The raw memory of this racism made any suggestion of Jewish ethnicity slightly taboo in my family. If I ever mentioned that someone \u201clooked Jewish\u201d my grandmother would respond, \u201cOh really? And what exactly does a Jew look like?\u201d Yet evidently, this wariness of ethnic categorization didn\u2019t stop my parents from sending swab samples from the inside of their cheeks off to a direct-to-consumer genetic testing company. The idea of having an ancient identity \u201cconfirmed\u201d by modern science was too alluring. Not that they\u2019re alone. As of the beginning of this year, more than 26 million people have taken at-home DNA tests. For most, like my parents, genetic identity is assimilated into an existing life story with relative ease, while for others, the test can unearth family secrets or capsize personal narratives around ethnic heritage. But as these genetic databases grow, genetic identity is reshaping not only how we understand ourselves, but how we can be identified by others. In the past year, law enforcement has become increasingly adept at using genetic data to solve cold cases; a recent study shows that even if you haven\u2019t taken a test, chances are you can be identified by authorities via genealogical sleuthing. What is perhaps more concerning, though, is how authorities around the world are also beginning to use DNA to not only identify individuals, but to categorize and discriminate against entire groups of people. In February of this year, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, reported that the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, the peak religious authority in the country, had been requesting DNA tests to confirm Jewishness before issuing some marriage licenses. In Israel, matrimonial law is religious, not civil. Jews can marry Jews, but intermarriage with Muslims or Christians is legally unacknowledged. This means that when a Jewish couple want to tie the knot, they are required by law to prove their Jewishness to the Rabbinate according to Orthodox tradition, which defines Jewish ancestry as being passed down through the mother. While for most Israeli Jews this simply involves handing over their mother\u2019s birth or marriage certificate, for many recent immigrants to Israel, who often come from communities where being Jewish is defined differently or documentation is scarce, producing evidence that satisfies the Rabbinate\u2019s standard of proof can be impossible. In the past, confirming Jewishness in the absence of documentation has involved contacting rabbis from the countries where people originate or tracking genealogical records back to prove religious continuity along the matrilineal line. But as was reported in Haaretz, and later confirmed by David Lau, the Ashkenazi chief rabbi of Israel, in the past year, the rabbis have been requesting that some people undergo a DNA test to verify their claim before being allowed to marry. For many Israelis, news that the rabbinical judges were turning to DNA testing was shocking, but for Seth Farber, an American-born Orthodox rabbi, it came as no surprise. Farber, who has been living in Israel since the 1990s, is the director of Itim, the Jewish Life Information Center, an organization that helps Israeli Jews navigate state-administered matters of Jewish life, like marriage and conversion. In the past year, the organization has seen up to 50 cases where families have been asked to undergo DNA tests to certify their Jewishness. Those being asked to take these tests, Farber told me, are mostly Russian-speaking Israelis, members of an almost 1 million-strong immigrant community who began moving to Israel from countries of the former Soviet Union in the 1990s. Due to the fact that Jewish life was forcefully suppressed during the Soviet era, many members of this community lack the necessary documentation to prove Jewishness through matrilineal descent. This means that although most self-identify as Jewish, hundreds of thousands are not considered so by the Rabbinate, and routinely have their Jewish status challenged when seeking religious services, including marriage. For almost two decades, Farber and his colleagues have advocated for this immigrant community in the face of what they see as targeted discrimination. In cases of marriage, Farber acts as a type of rabbinical lawyer, pulling together documentation and making a case for his clients in front of a board of rabbinical judges. He fears that DNA testing will place even more power in the hands of the Rabbinate and further marginalize the Russian-speaking community. \u201cIt\u2019s as if the rabbis have become technocrats,\u201d he told me. \u201cThey are using genetics to give validity to their discriminatory practices.\u201d Despite public outrage and protests in central Tel Aviv, the Rabbinate have not indicated any intention of ending DNA testing, and reports continue to circulate in the Israeli media of how the test is being used. One woman allegedly had to ask her mother and aunt for genetic material to prove that she was not adopted. Another man was asked to have his grandmother, sick with dementia, take a test. Boris Shindler, a political activist and active member of the Russian-speaking community, told me that he believes that the full extent of the practice remains unknown, because many of those who have been tested are unwilling to share their stories publicly out of a sense of shame. \u201cI was approached by someone who was married in a Jewish ceremony maybe 15, 20 years ago, who recently received an official demand saying if you want to continue to be Jewish, we\u2019d like you to do a DNA test,\u201d Shindler said. \u201cThey said if she doesn\u2019t do it then she has to sign papers saying she is not Jewish. But she is too humiliated to go to the press with this.\u201d What offends Shindler most is that the technique is being used to single out his community, which he sees as part of a broader stigmatization of Russian-speaking immigrants in Israeli society as unassimilated outsiders and second-class citizens. \u201cIt is sad because in the Soviet Union we were persecuted for being Jewish and now in Israel we\u2019re being discriminated against for not being Jewish enough,\u201d he said. As well as being deeply humiliating, Shindler told me that there is confusion around what being genetically Jewish means. \u201cHow do they decide when someone becomes Jewish,\u201d he asked. \u201cIf I have 51% Jewish DNA does that mean I\u2019m Jewish, but if I\u2019m 49% I\u2019m not?\u201d But according to Yosef Carmel, an Orthodox rabbi and co-head of Eretz Hemdah, a Jerusalem-based institute that trains rabbinical judges for the Rabbinate, this is a misunderstanding of how the DNA testing is being used. He explained that the Rabbinate are not using a generalized Jewish ancestry test, but one that screens for a specific variant on the mitochondrial DNA \u2013 DNA that is passed down through the mother \u2013 that can be found almost exclusively in Ashkenazi Jews. A number of years ago Carmel consulted genetic experts who informed him that if someone bears this specific mitochondrial DNA marker, there is a 90 to 99% chance that this person is of Ashkenazi ancestry. This was enough to convince him to pass a religious ruling in 2017 that states that this specific DNA test can be used to confirm Jewishness if all other avenues have been exhausted, which now constitutes the theological justification for the genetic testing. For David Goldstein, professor of medical research in genetics at Columbia University whose 2008 book, Jacob\u2019s Legacy: A Genetic View of Jewish History, outlines a decade\u2019s worth of research into Jewish population genetics, translating scientific insights about small genetic variants in the DNA to normative judgments about religious or ethnic identity is not only problematic, but misunderstands what the science actually signals. \u201cWhen we say that there is a signal of Jewish ancestry, it\u2019s a highly specific statistical analysis done over a population,\u201d he said. \u201cTo think that you can use these type of analyses to make any substantive claims about politics or religion or questions of identity, I think that it\u2019s frankly ridiculous.\u201d But others would disagree. As DNA sequencing becomes more sophisticated, the ability to identify genetic differences between human populations has improved. Geneticists can now locate variations in the DNA so acutely as to differentiate populations living on opposite sides of a mountain range. In recent years, a number of high-profile commentators have appropriated these scientific insights to push the idea that genetics can determine who we are socially, none more controversially than the former New York Times science writer Nicholas Wade. In his 2014 book, A Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race and Human History, Wade argues that genetic differences in human populations manifest in predictable social differences between those groups. His book was strongly denounced by almost all prominent researchers in the field as a shoddy incarnation of race science, but the idea that our DNA can determine who we are in some social sense has also crept into more mainstream perspectives. In an op-ed published in the New York Times last year, the Harvard geneticist David Reich argued that although genetics does not substantiate any racist stereotypes, differences in genetic ancestry do correlate to many of today\u2019s racial constructs. \u201cI have deep sympathy for the concern that genetic discoveries could be misused to justify racism,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut as a geneticist I also know that it is simply no longer possible to ignore average genetic differences among \u2018races\u2019.\u201d Reich\u2019s op-ed was shared widely and drew condemnation from other geneticists and social science researchers. In an open letter to Buzzfeed, a group of 67 experts also criticized Reich\u2019s careless communication of his ideas. The signatories worried that imprecise language within such a fraught field of research would make the insights of population genetics more susceptible to being \u201cmisunderstood and misinterpreted\u201d, lending scientific validity to racist ideology and ethno-nationalist politics. And indeed, this already appears to be happening. In the United States, white nationalists have channeled the ideals of racial purity into an obsession with the reliability of direct-to-consumer DNA testing. In Greece, the neo-fascist Golden Dawn party regularly draw on studies on the origins of Greek DNA to \u201cprove\u201d 4,000 years of racial continuity and ethnic supremacy. Most concerning is how the conflation of genetics and racial identity is being mobilized politically. In Australia, the far-right One Nation party recently suggested that First Nations people be given DNA tests to \u201cprove\u201d how Indigenous they are before receiving government benefits. In February, the New York Times reported that authorities in China are using DNA testing to determine whether someone is of Uighur ancestry, as part of a broader campaign of surveillance and oppression against the Muslim minority. While DNA testing in Israel is still limited to proving Jewishness in relation to religious life, it comes at a time when the intersections of ethnic, political and religious identity are becoming increasingly blurry. Just last year, Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government passed the Nation State law, which codified that the right to national self-determination in the country is \u201cunique to the Jewish people\u201d. Shlomo Sand, an Israeli historian who has written extensively on the politics of Jewish population genetics, worries that if DNA testing is normalized by the Rabbinate, it could be used to confirm citizenship in the future. \u201cIsraeli society is becoming more of a closed, ethno-centric society,\u201d he said. \u201cI am worried that people will start to use this genetic testing to build this political national identity.\u201d For Sand, there is a particularly dark irony that this type of genetic discrimination is being weaponized by Jews against other Jews. \u201cI am the descendant of Holocaust survivors, people who suffered because of biological and essentialist attitudes to human groups,\u201d he told me. \u201cWhen I hear stories of people using DNA to prove that you are a Jew, or French, or Greek, or Finnish, I feel like the Nazis lost the war, but they won the victory of an ideology of essentialist identity through the blood.\u201d But for Seth Farber, the problem with a DNA test for Jewishness runs deeper than politics; it contravenes what he believes to be the essence of Jewish identity. There is a specific principle in Jewish law, he told me, that instructs rabbis not to undermine someone\u2019s self-declared religious identity if that person has been accepted by a Jewish community. The central principle is that when it comes to Jewish identity, the most important determinants are social \u2013 trust, kinship, commitment \u2013 not biological. \u201cOur tradition has always been that if someone lives among us and partakes in communal and religious life, then they are one of us,\u201d Farber said. \u201cJust because we have 23andMe doesn\u2019t mean that we should abandon this. That would be an unwarranted and radical reinterpretation of Jewish law.\u201d As I was reporting this story, it often struck me as oxymoronic that an institution like the Rabbinate would embrace new technology to uphold an ancient identity. It seemed to contradict the very premise of Orthodoxy, which, by definition, is supposed to rigidly maintain tradition in the face of all that is new and unknown. But Jessica Mozersky, assistant professor of medicine at Washington University in St Louis, explained that part of the reason why the Rabbinate might be comfortable with using DNA to confirm Jewishness is because of an existing familiarity with genetic testing in the community to screen for rare genetic conditions. \u201cBecause Ashkenazi communities have a history of marrying in, they have this high risk for certain heritable diseases and have established genetic screening programs,\u201d she explained. \u201cSo this has made it less fraught and problematic to talk about Jewish genetics in Ashkenazi communities.\u201d In fact, the Orthodox Jewish community is so comfortable with the idea of genetic identity that they have even put together their own international genetic database called Dor Yeshorim, which acts as both a dating service and public health initiative. When two members of the community are being set up for marriage, Mozersky explained, the matchmaker will check whether or not they are genetically compatible on the DNA database. \u201cThis means that the notion of genetics as a part of identity is deeply interwoven in many ways with communal life,\u201d she said. This is something I could identify with. When I was 16 and attending a Jewish day-school in Melbourne, Australia, we had what was called \u201cmouth-swab day\u201d. Everyone in my grade gathered on the basketball courts to provide spit samples that were sent off and screened for Tay-Sachs disease, a rare inherited disorder significantly more common among Ashkenazi Jews that eats away at the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. As we waited in line, we joked that this was our punishment for our ancestors marrying their cousins. A few weeks later, after we got the results, I told my grandmother about \u201cmouth-swab day\u201d. I was interested in her thoughts on my newly discovered genetic identity, which seemed to connect me biologically to the world she grew up in, a world of insularity, religiosity, tradition, and trauma. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019ve always said,\u201d she declared, after I told her that I wasn\u2019t a carrier of this rare genetic mutation. \u201cIt\u2019s important to mix the blood.\u201d",

Charlotte Edmonds With her bleach-blond bob, Charlotte Edmonds looks the epitome of cool, and you could say the same about the 22-year-old\u2019s dance. Plucked out of the Rambert school to become the Royal Ballet\u2019s first Young Choreographer, Edmonds impressed everyone during a three-year association with Covent Garden, where she was mentored by Wayne McGregor, made choreography for Selfridges, a film for the National Gallery and a ballet with basketball that was inspired by the legendary choreographer Kenneth MacMillan. Since going freelance, she\u2019s made an underwater ballet about depression, featuring ballerina Francesca Hayward, and is keen to work more in digital platforms. She is doing post-production on a film she has directed about plastic pollution, is making a documentary series about dyslexia (a condition she has herself) and is working on a ballet about the climate crisis. These might be serious subjects, but Edmonds is more and more drawn to fizzy, pop-culture-inspired choreography, closing the gap between the ballet stage and the dancefloor, such as a funky solo she made for the Royal Ballet\u2019s Joseph Sissens and a new piece set to the music of Hot Chip. A go-to choreographer for big ballet companies looking to make relevant work for their younger dancers, Edmonds has no fewer than three different works being performed at the forthcoming Young Talent festival, by the junior companies of Dutch National Ballet and Norwegian National Ballet, and the Rambert school. The Young Talent festival is at Linbury theatre, Royal Opera House, London, 18 June-6 July. Stina Quagebeur Belgian dancer Stina Quagebeur has been choreographing since she was inspired as a child by the ballets of Mats Ek and Maurice B\u00e9jart. She\u2019s kept it up as a sideline throughout her career as a dancer with English National Ballet. At 34, she is making her mark as a dance-maker with a strong sense of her own voice. ENB director Tamara Rojo has put her faith in Quagebeur and gave her a main stage debut as part of the company\u2019s She Persisted show, highlighting female choreographers.

Sophie Laplane Another dancer turned choreographer nurtured within a company\u2019s ranks, Sophie Laplane follows 13 years as a dancer with Scottish Ballet by becoming its artist in residence. About to turn 35, the Frenchwoman, who trained at the Paris Opera Ballet school, made her first one-act commission, Sibilo, in 2016. Sibilo is sophisticated, classy choreography but has humour, too \u2013 molten duets, staccato gestures, elastic torsos and shimmying six-packs. Her piece Click!, for Ballet Black, saw the dancers in acid-bright suits, pointe shoes and shoulder pads, and the rhythm pinging through their bodies with some serious groove. It seemed as if it could take ballet in a fresh direction. Laplane has experimented with film and 360-degree video. Her work Maze was adapted into a short film shot in a derelict swimming pool in Glasgow, all gitchy electro music and jerky bodies, looking like two long-legged birds courting. Her latest piece, Dextera, was created to mark Scottish Ballet\u2019s 50th anniversary, and tackles gender politics with wit and cheek (to the sound of Mozart). She has also worked with New York City Ballet\u2019s Choreographic Institute, is creating a new piece in the space of one week for Scottish Ballet\u2019s Digital Season (it can be viewed on the company\u2019s Facebook feed), and is about to graduate with an MA in choreography \u2013 not that Laplane needs a certificate to prove her credentials. Sibilo and Dextera will be performed at Jacksons Lane, London, on 19 June. Arielle Smith Rambert-trained Arielle Smith has had one of the best starts you can imagine, landing a gig as young associate choreographer with Matthew Bourne\u2019s New Adventures company, working alongside Bourne on his new production of Romeo and Juliet. The Havana-born, British-raised 22-year-old created several pieces at the National Youth Ballet and has now set up her own company, with some excellent younger dancers. Smith enjoys making abstract mass movement, as in the piece Storm, which she created while still at school. But she\u2019s most interested in making dance that explores being human, not just dancing for dancing\u2019s sake. Her short piece Lots of Varied Expectations addresses that old favourite, love, against a warm and whimsical backdrop of 1940s songs, with movement that is fun and quirky, and with playful use of rhythm, but always with an underlying emotion. Smith is expanding the piece into a full-length work and plans a national tour next year. \u201cArielle\u2019s a wonder,\u201d says Bourne. \u201cI really liked the choreography she\u2019s done for National Youth Ballet. It stood out as being very contemporary, very different. She\u2019s very mature for her age. We laugh a lot.

      "body": "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s ban on transgender people serving in the US military has spread a pall of fear over the 15,000 personnel it touches and emboldened hostility towards even those on the frontline of active duty, an investigation by the Guardian has found.</p> <p>The ban kicked in on <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/12/politics/transgender-troop-ban-starts/index.html\">12 April</a> and, two months into its imposition, the full chilling effects are only now becoming apparent. <a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/explore/story/Article/1783822/5-things-to-know-about-dods-new-policy-on-military-service-by-transgender-perso/\">Under its terms</a>, trans people seeking to enlist in the military are subject to an almost total exclusion unless they keep their gender identity hidden.</p> <p>Most individuals who are already serving are similarly forced to keep their true selves tightly closeted. There are exceptions, but they are narrowly defined and hard to procure.</p> <p>Last week, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/another-trump-falsehood-trans-people-take-massive-amounts-drugs-n1014221\">Trump tried to justify</a> the ban by complaining about the high costs associated with treating military personnel for gender dysphoria, the formal diagnosis when an individual\u2019s gender is different from the one assigned to them at birth. In fact the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/07/26/the-military-spends-five-times-as-much-on-viagra-as-it-would-on-transgender-troops-medical-care/?utm_term=.c816c2529daf\">entire medical budget</a> for gender transition-related care is a tenth what the armed forces spend annually on Viagra and Cialis.</p> <p>The US president has also blamed trans individuals for causing \u201ctremendous disruption\u201d within the armed forces. That conflicts with the experience of <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/countries-that-let-transgender-soldiers-serve-2019-2\">19 countries</a> including Australia, Canada, Germany and the UK that have allowed trans people to serve without incident.</p> <p>In the US, all four military service chiefs have testified before Congress that there were <a href=\"https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2018/04/24/all-4-service-chiefs-on-record-no-harm-to-unit-from-transgender-service/\">no known negative effects</a> during the three years in which President Obama opened the doors to trans people.</p> <p>\u201cThe biggest impact of the ban is that we are denying ourselves future heroes. Our nation needs the best and finest to fight and win future wars and we are turning away people just because they are trans,\u201d said Lt Col B Fram, communications director of SPART*A, an education and advocacy group representing trans service members.</p> <p>The Guardian partnered with SPART*A to investigate how Trump\u2019s ban is bearing down on trans women and men in active duty settings. Here we profile four people in the navy and air force.</p> <p>All are in aircrew and at the sharp end of the US fighting machine. They are familiar with the intense sacrifices to family and self that a military career involves, and have put their lives on the line in conflict zones.</p> <p>Yet they are now having to cope with severe pressures brought about by the ban. That includes mounting hostility from transphobic peers who see Trump\u2019s move as license to taunt and ridicule, as well as the daily fear that if they are outed as trans they could lose everything.</p> <p>The stakes are now so high that all four spoke to the Guardian insisting on absolute anonymity. As one of them put it: \u201cIf I were found out by even one person, that would be the end of my flying career.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Emily Finnerty, US </strong><strong>navy, F-18 fighter pilot, trans woman</strong></h2> <p><strong>When you meet</strong> Emily Finnerty in person, as the Guardian did recently, she comes across as more Tom Cruise than Tom Cruise. She has the same piercing gaze and verbal intensity of the Top Gun star, especially when describing the sensation of piloting an F-18 Super Hornet, the fighter jet that Cruise will fly in the sequel to the classic movie scheduled for release next year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6ba80763ce8c339850f910e6a8319088c6c1ecf2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ba80763ce8c339850f910e6a8319088c6c1ecf2/0_0_5304_7952/667.jpg\" alt=\"Emily Finnerty\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emily Finnerty.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lexey Swall/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If Cruise\u2019s role in Top Gun is Hollywood\u2019s attempt to personify American military might and patriotic service, then Finnerty is the real deal. She knows what it\u2019s like to fly at Mach speeds in that state-of-the-art $90m fighting machine. She has felt the punch in the gut when the aircraft explodes from the deck of a US navy carrier and endured the bone-crushing sustained 7.5gs of the dogfights that followed.</p> <p>She is familiar with the terror and exhilaration of going zero to 160mph in two seconds. She can recall the glory of flying low through the canyons of Utah or the beauty of hugging the mountains of California. And she\u2019s been there when training gets serious, notching up 60 combat missions in the all-too-real war zones of Iraq and Afghanistan.</p> <p>Through all that, there has been the sacrifice that being on the frontlines of the US military extracts from her family and from herself. \u201cMy children didn\u2019t know me, I was away so much. My back\u2019s destroyed from the G-force. I\u2019ve had near-death experiences from aircraft failure and I\u2019ve seen friends die. But I\u2019ve never betrayed the trust of my country and I\u2019ve always answered the call.\u201d</p> <p>The US military has spent more than $11m in turning Finnerty from a young navy recruit over a decade ago into a lieutenant commander today. But now it is in danger of squandering every cent of that investment, by effectively valuing her as worthless.</p> <p>Since the age of 10, Finnerty has secretly struggled with dysphoria. Though assigned male at birth, and presenting in public and within the navy as male, she has strong urges to transition and live authentically as a woman. <br> She came out to her wife and parents only a few weeks ago and is working through the trauma of that shattering revelation with her supportive family. If it is hard at home, it is far more difficult at work. Under the terms of Trump\u2019s ban she will only be able to stay in the navy if she continues to wrap herself in a lie. She must put aside any desire to live as her authentic self and forego any medical treatment in order to present as a man and be allowed to continue to serve.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Yet, because I see myself as a woman, I'm somehow less worthy to serve</p> <footer> <cite>Emily Finnerty</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She is puzzled by the vast contrast between the faith that the military has put in her over so many years, and the utter lack of faith it is showing her now. \u201cThey have invested millions in me, and I have performed my duties to an exceptional level,\u201d she said. \u201cYet because I see myself as a woman, I\u2019m somehow less worthy to serve.\u201d</p> <p>The ironies of Finnerty\u2019s position are not lost on her. Her mission within the military, she believes, is to serve the US constitution and uphold the freedom and human rights of her fellow Americans and people around the world. Yet to do so, she must forego her own freedom and human rights.</p> <p>\u201cMy fellow service members and I have tried to build a better, safer world for people, but it\u2019s a world I can\u2019t live in,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She is being told that it is not in the best interests of the US military to have trans individuals openly serving. Yet for years she has been at the forefront of the most powerful fighting force on Earth, a closeted trans individual, earning plaudits and promotions all the way. To prove it she shows us her white dress jacket dripping with medals.</p> <p>She could earn much more money and have an easier life for her family as a civilian \u2013 there are no prohibitions against flying as a commercial airline pilot. Yet she knows that were she to ask her superiors to reciprocate such personal sacrifice with even the most basic help, such as a session with a counselor about her dysphoria, that could put her wings and her entire Top Gun career in jeopardy.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you think that does for the health of the individual?\u201d she said. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s a mess. I can\u2019t be authentic and I\u2019m not allowed to do anything about it.\u201d</p> <p>Finnerty is too much of an officer and a gentlewoman to criticize Trump for the trans ban. All she will say is: \u201cI believe he thinks he\u2019s doing what\u2019s right. He\u2019s the commander-in-chief.\u201d</p> <p>But she does confess to being disappointed and distressed by the order. \u201cI\u2019m angry, mostly because I think as a country we can do better. We are the frickin\u2019 United States of America, we were founded on freedom. But here we are saying, \u2018You can have your freedom, unless \u2026\u2019 That doesn\u2019t jibe with me.\u201d</p> <p>What Trump and his joint chiefs of staff need to hear loud and clear is that Finnerty is now questioning her future in the services. At a time of a <a href=\"https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-air-force/2018/04/11/the-militarys-stunning-fighter-pilot-shortage-one-in-four-billets-is-empty/\">stunning shortage in fighter pilots</a>, she is contemplating making an exit.</p> <p>\u201cIt has made me think about getting out,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s time to go and be authentic.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3078442b3a49a56662596d44340154b82443b247\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3078442b3a49a56662596d44340154b82443b247/0_0_3165_2110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US Navy\u2019s Blue Angels fly over the Navy-Marine Corps Memorial stadium during a graduation ceremony at the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US navy\u2019s Blue Angels fly over the Navy-Marine Corps Memorial stadium during a graduation ceremony at the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Wong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>M, US </strong><strong>navy, winged aviator, trans man</strong></h2> <p><strong>M, </strong><strong>an active duty lieutenant</strong> and winged aviator in the navy, is most at risk of being evicted from the military of any of the four service members who spoke to the Guardian.</p> <p>The cause of his precarious position is that he has begun to transition to male \u2013 without informing his superiors. As he puts it: \u201cI am walking the fine line of fighting for myself but still fighting for my country, which, for trans individuals, is an absurdly immense challenge.\u201d</p> <p>He has had chest-contouring surgery as the first major step towards medically transitioning as a trans man. Now he knows that unless he succeeds in keeping his true existence utterly secret, his young, successful career in the navy could be snuffed out.</p> <p><a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2018/Mar/23/2001894037/-1/-1/0/MILITARY-SERVICE-BY-TRANSGENDER-INDIVIDUALS.PDF\">As the ban states</a>, \u201ctransgender persons who require or have undergone gender transition are disqualified\u201d. In short: get discovered, and you\u2019re out.</p> <p>The Guardian\u2019s interaction with him was conducted in tightest security. He asked only to be referred to as \u201cM\u201d \u2013 the abbreviation of his male name that is in itself known only to very few. He also declined to discuss certain aspects of his story, such as the shocking harassment he endured from a former skipper, on grounds that some of his aircrew might recognize the detail and draw conclusions.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I think my service would be even better if I didn't have the anxiety of keeping closeted hanging over me</p> <footer> <cite>M</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Over six years of military service, M has learned how to keep his head down and out of the spotlight. Despite two full tours of service fighting Isis in Iraq and Syria, many military awards and a spotless record, he has been forced to embrace secrecy.</p> <p>\u201cThe ban has made me very careful around my squadron and fellow aircrew, including my wardroom. I\u2019m exceedingly careful not to engage in discussion about the ban, or politics in general, and I keep my relationships with my peers strictly professional. I\u2019ve established myself as being \u2018very quiet\u2019, and my silence is now considered normal.\u201d</p> <p>Despite his male identity, others continue to know him as the \u201cfemale officer with the short haircut\u201d. He grits his teeth when at formal functions he\u2019s forced to wear women\u2019s dress uniform with its antiquated 17th-century pants with side buttons, distinct suit top and hat that bears no resemblance to the men\u2019s classic wide-brimmed sailor\u2019s hat.</p> <p>\u201cIt makes me feel like a fraud. I feel less and less like I\u2019m participating in the great traditions of the navy, and more like I\u2019m performing in costume. I\u2019m not the same man who just a month ago was in a flight suit like everyone else flying combat missions.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s another aspect of the double life M now lives under the ban. To those around him he is a demure, softly spoken, understated woman. Internally, he is a profoundly hurt and saddened man.</p> <p>In emails to the Guardian, he laments that were he to openly begin testosterone hormone replacement therapy he would be downed from aviation permanently. He describes as \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201cstone-aged\u201d the fact that US armed forces still classify gender dysphoria as a \u201cmental disorder\u201d.</p> <p>He is convinced that the most advantageous policy for the military would be the exact opposite of Trump\u2019s ban. Allowing M to transition would actually benefit the navy because he could fulfill his potential in service to the nation. \u201cI think my service would be even better if I didn\u2019t have the anxiety of keeping closeted hanging over me,\u201d he said.</p> <p>At the root of it all, he thinks, is the ignorance and fear of the American public towards trans people. \u201cSo often, transgender individuals are made out to be these \u2018scary\u2019 concepts in faraway cities that you hear about on the news but have never met in real life. People \u2013 both civilian and military \u2013 need to realize that we are people too and make huge sacrifices that they would never dream of.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e80214f3093d68009b624d6add19daec3874fd98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e80214f3093d68009b624d6add19daec3874fd98/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump unleashed a Twitter storm in July 2017 which he vowed to ban transgender people from serving \u201cin any capacity\u201d in the US military.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump unleashed a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/01/donald-trump-tweets-transgender-military-service-ban/579655/\">Twitter storm</a> in July 2017 which he vowed to ban transgender people from serving \u2018in any capacity\u2019 in the US military.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Jennifer, US </strong><strong>air </strong><strong>force, flight engineer, trans woman</strong></h2> <p><strong>The mood has darkened</strong> in Jennifer\u2019s command since the ban came in. A master sergeant and flight engineer in the air force, she has noticed that leadership in the higher ranks have started to pursue witch-hunts seeking to detect and remove trans individuals from the service.</p> <p>At lower levels, the climate has grown even uglier. \u201cThose who were against us have become far more outspoken about how we don\u2019t belong,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s as though in this extremely transphobic environment they feel they have to bash trans military members merely to fit in.\u201d</p> <p>US air force flying operations have always been among the most hostile corners of the military for trans people. Even during the brief three-year period under Obama when restrictions were generally loosened, being outed in the air force would still cost aircrew their wings.</p> <p>That prohibition is toughened under the new ban, with the added burden that verbal abuse surrounding it has intensified. When someone has the temerity to come out as trans in the air force, Jennifer said, news spreads quickly, they are promptly removed from flying status and they are branded in mess-room banter as \u201cnon-mission hackers\u201d and \u201closers\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if they have an exemplary past record or that they are devoted to flying and deploying. None of that positive information gets out. All that is discussed is that they are trans and they don\u2019t belong.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If I were found out by even one person, that would be the end of my flying career</p> <footer> <cite>Jennifer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Jennifer knows that the same brutal logic applies to her. As a trans woman who is required to be scrupulously male on base, it doesn\u2019t matter that she has had an exemplary career in the air force spanning more than 20 years. It doesn\u2019t matter that she\u2019s flown more than 6,000 hours being qualified on several different aircraft and has been honored with more than 20 ribbons and medals.</p> <p>\u201cIf I were found out by even one person, that would be the end of my flying career,\u201d she said.</p> <p>So, like M, she is very strict about security and keeping her womanhood secret. Since the ban kicked in, she said, \u201cI have become far more guarded and watch everything I do, from my mannerisms to managing when I exercise and shower, where I go off-base after work and how I dress. I cannot ever let my guard down.\u201d</p> <p>She avoids alcohol for fear that it might lull her into disclosing personal information. She wears baggy clothes to hide her physique. She preplans every move she makes and thinks constantly that the sacred trust of those around her, the trust upon which the US military is founded, would instantly be eviscerated if anybody discovered her true self.</p> <p>And yet her devotion to the air force remains constant. At times, though, she admitted, \u201cmy drive does take a hit when I am willing to die for freedoms others enjoy but I am being denied\u201d.</p> <p>She added: \u201cI love my country and it\u2019s people, even the ones who think I should be banned. I believe if they just had a chance to meet one of us and realize we are normal people trying to live our life, doing our best every day, they might change their mind.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"989a4edc7adaf265901faeac200d88c5c1ab0f77\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/989a4edc7adaf265901faeac200d88c5c1ab0f77/0_0_3528_2556/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A US Air Force FA-18 Hornet takes part in a military exercise.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"724\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A US air force FA-18 Hornet takes part in a military exercise.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bullit Marquez/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Caleb, US </strong><strong>navy, aircrewman, trans man</strong></h2> <p><strong>Caleb is a petty officer</strong> who serves as a naval aircrewman, operating equipment in tactical missions around the world. He is the only one of the four service members profiled here to take advantage of a little known caveat within Trump\u2019s trans ban known as the \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d.</p> <p>It allows people who were already in the armed forces and who acquired a diagnosis of gender dysphoria before the ban kicked in on 12 April to carry on serving in their correct gender. In other words, if you could get a military doctor officially to record your trans status in time, you could avoid the prohibition.</p> <p>The clause sparked a frantic scramble by Caleb and many like him to secure a diagnosis by the deadline. Assigned female at birth, he is desperate to transition and is keen to start hormone replacement therapy and surgery.</p> <p>But he is also desperate to hang on to his flight status and with it the valued role he so dearly loves that has taken him on numerous combat missions to Syria and other conflict zones. As he put it to the Guardian from his current deployment overseas: \u201cIt may be cheesy but every day when I walk on the flightline my pride surges. Often I look out the window over places I never dreamed I\u2019d see.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m having to choose between serving my country in the job I love and being myself, and it\u2019s really tough</p> <footer> <cite>Caleb</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Applying for a diagnosis against the clock was hair-raising in itself. There was a long waiting list to see the one doctor at the behavioral health unit in his command who treats trans patients.</p> <p>As the deadline approached, he took the hazardous step of visiting the general medical clinic to lobby staff for a rapid diagnosis. That was risky as it involved coming out as a trans man to people he did not know and could not necessarily trust.</p> <p>Clinic workers were suspicious that he was seeking diagnosis as a ruse to shirk deployment. That really irked him, as the truth was precisely the reverse: he was delaying transition and potentially harming his own health so that he could carry on flying tactical missions.</p> <p>By the time he finally got to see the doctor and have a diagnosis written into his record, it was with only days to spare. He squeaked through, along with up to 2,000 other trans service members who SPART*A estimates have been grandfathered in.</p> <p>You might think that qualifying for the clause, and with it an exemption from the ban, would be the end of Caleb\u2019s troubles. Not so. Though he has formally been recognized as a trans person, he feels far too unsettled by what has happened to go ahead with transition.</p> <p>\u201cOn paper I\u2019m safe from the ban, but I\u2019m nervous that if I come out now I might lose my chance to fly. It would only take one person in my chain of command who doesn\u2019t agree with transgender people being in the military for me to potentially be taken off deployments.\u201d</p> <p>To add to the jitters, the Pentagon made clear in the <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2018/Mar/23/2001894037/-1/-1/0/MILITARY-SERVICE-BY-TRANSGENDER-INDIVIDUALS.PDF\">memo</a> setting out the ban that the grandfather clause is legally tentative. The memo explicitly threatens that were the clause ever used to challenge the ban in court, then it would automatically be scrapped and everyone who had enjoyed its protection would immediately be expelled.</p> <p>That leaves Caleb in uncharted territory. \u201cI am proceeding with caution and being careful about coming out,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He remains closeted to all but a very few. He secretly binds his chest as one small concession to his authentic male identity, but wears his hair longer than he would choose to avoid attracting attention.</p> <p>While he is delaying taking hormones to start medical transition because he fears it might lead to him being taken off flight status, he is grateful that being grandfathered in at least gives him the choice eventually to be openly trans while still remaining in the military. He says that makes him feel lucky.</p> <p>He was also pleasantly surprised that when he privately came out to two co-workers recently they were generous and supportive. That has given him hope that one day he might be liberated without utterly being ostracized by those around him.</p> <p>For now, though, he remains trapped in limbo. \u201cI\u2019m having to choose between serving my country in the job I love and being myself, and it\u2019s really tough.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s ban on transgender people serving in the US military has spread a pall of fear over the 15,000 personnel it touches and emboldened hostility towards even those on the frontline of active duty, an investigation by the Guardian has found. The ban kicked in on 12 April and, two months into its imposition, the full chilling effects are only now becoming apparent. Under its terms, trans people seeking to enlist in the military are subject to an almost total exclusion unless they keep their gender identity hidden. Most individuals who are already serving are similarly forced to keep their true selves tightly closeted. There are exceptions, but they are narrowly defined and hard to procure. Last week, Trump tried to justify the ban by complaining about the high costs associated with treating military personnel for gender dysphoria, the formal diagnosis when an individual\u2019s gender is different from the one assigned to them at birth. In fact the entire medical budget for gender transition-related care is a tenth what the armed forces spend annually on Viagra and Cialis. The US president has also blamed trans individuals for causing \u201ctremendous disruption\u201d within the armed forces. That conflicts with the experience of 19 countries including Australia, Canada, Germany and the UK that have allowed trans people to serve without incident. In the US, all four military service chiefs have testified before Congress that there were no known negative effects during the three years in which President Obama opened the doors to trans people. \u201cThe biggest impact of the ban is that we are denying ourselves future heroes. Our nation needs the best and finest to fight and win future wars and we are turning away people just because they are trans,\u201d said Lt Col B Fram, communications director of SPART*A, an education and advocacy group representing trans service members. The Guardian partnered with SPART*A to investigate how Trump\u2019s ban is bearing down on trans women and men in active duty settings. Here we profile four people in the navy and air force. All are in aircrew and at the sharp end of the US fighting machine. They are familiar with the intense sacrifices to family and self that a military career involves, and have put their lives on the line in conflict zones. Yet they are now having to cope with severe pressures brought about by the ban. That includes mounting hostility from transphobic peers who see Trump\u2019s move as license to taunt and ridicule, as well as the daily fear that if they are outed as trans they could lose everything. The stakes are now so high that all four spoke to the Guardian insisting on absolute anonymity. As one of them put it: \u201cIf I were found out by even one person, that would be the end of my flying career.\u201d Emily Finnerty, US navy, F-18 fighter pilot, trans woman When you meet Emily Finnerty in person, as the Guardian did recently, she comes across as more Tom Cruise than Tom Cruise. She has the same piercing gaze and verbal intensity of the Top Gun star, especially when describing the sensation of piloting an F-18 Super Hornet, the fighter jet that Cruise will fly in the sequel to the classic movie scheduled for release next year. If Cruise\u2019s role in Top Gun is Hollywood\u2019s attempt to personify American military might and patriotic service, then Finnerty is the real deal. She knows what it\u2019s like to fly at Mach speeds in that state-of-the-art $90m fighting machine. She has felt the punch in the gut when the aircraft explodes from the deck of a US navy carrier and endured the bone-crushing sustained 7.5gs of the dogfights that followed. She is familiar with the terror and exhilaration of going zero to 160mph in two seconds. She can recall the glory of flying low through the canyons of Utah or the beauty of hugging the mountains of California. And she\u2019s been there when training gets serious, notching up 60 combat missions in the all-too-real war zones of Iraq and Afghanistan. Through all that, there has been the sacrifice that being on the frontlines of the US military extracts from her family and from herself. \u201cMy children didn\u2019t know me, I was away so much. My back\u2019s destroyed from the G-force. I\u2019ve had near-death experiences from aircraft failure and I\u2019ve seen friends die. But I\u2019ve never betrayed the trust of my country and I\u2019ve always answered the call.\u201d The US military has spent more than $11m in turning Finnerty from a young navy recruit over a decade ago into a lieutenant commander today. But now it is in danger of squandering every cent of that investment, by effectively valuing her as worthless. Since the age of 10, Finnerty has secretly struggled with dysphoria. Though assigned male at birth, and presenting in public and within the navy as male, she has strong urges to transition and live authentically as a woman. She came out to her wife and parents only a few weeks ago and is working through the trauma of that shattering revelation with her supportive family. If it is hard at home, it is far more difficult at work. Under the terms of Trump\u2019s ban she will only be able to stay in the navy if she continues to wrap herself in a lie. She must put aside any desire to live as her authentic self and forego any medical treatment in order to present as a man and be allowed to continue to serve. She is puzzled by the vast contrast between the faith that the military has put in her over so many years, and the utter lack of faith it is showing her now. \u201cThey have invested millions in me, and I have performed my duties to an exceptional level,\u201d she said. \u201cYet because I see myself as a woman, I\u2019m somehow less worthy to serve.\u201d The ironies of Finnerty\u2019s position are not lost on her. Her mission within the military, she believes, is to serve the US constitution and uphold the freedom and human rights of her fellow Americans and people around the world. Yet to do so, she must forego her own freedom and human rights. \u201cMy fellow service members and I have tried to build a better, safer world for people, but it\u2019s a world I can\u2019t live in,\u201d she said. She is being told that it is not in the best interests of the US military to have trans individuals openly serving. Yet for years she has been at the forefront of the most powerful fighting force on Earth, a closeted trans individual, earning plaudits and promotions all the way. To prove it she shows us her white dress jacket dripping with medals. She could earn much more money and have an easier life for her family as a civilian \u2013 there are no prohibitions against flying as a commercial airline pilot. Yet she knows that were she to ask her superiors to reciprocate such personal sacrifice with even the most basic help, such as a session with a counselor about her dysphoria, that could put her wings and her entire Top Gun career in jeopardy. \u201cWhat do you think that does for the health of the individual?\u201d she said. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s a mess. I can\u2019t be authentic and I\u2019m not allowed to do anything about it.\u201d Finnerty is too much of an officer and a gentlewoman to criticize Trump for the trans ban. All she will say is: \u201cI believe he thinks he\u2019s doing what\u2019s right. He\u2019s the commander-in-chief.\u201d But she does confess to being disappointed and distressed by the order. \u201cI\u2019m angry, mostly because I think as a country we can do better. We are the frickin\u2019 United States of America, we were founded on freedom. But here we are saying, \u2018You can have your freedom, unless \u2026\u2019 That doesn\u2019t jibe with me.\u201d What Trump and his joint chiefs of staff need to hear loud and clear is that Finnerty is now questioning her future in the services. At a time of a stunning shortage in fighter pilots, she is contemplating making an exit. \u201cIt has made me think about getting out,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s time to go and be authentic.\u201d M, US navy, winged aviator, trans man M, an active duty lieutenant and winged aviator in the navy, is most at risk of being evicted from the military of any of the four service members who spoke to the Guardian. The cause of his precarious position is that he has begun to transition to male \u2013 without informing his superiors. As he puts it: \u201cI am walking the fine line of fighting for myself but still fighting for my country, which, for trans individuals, is an absurdly immense challenge.\u201d He has had chest-contouring surgery as the first major step towards medically transitioning as a trans man. Now he knows that unless he succeeds in keeping his true existence utterly secret, his young, successful career in the navy could be snuffed out. As the ban states, \u201ctransgender persons who require or have undergone gender transition are disqualified\u201d. In short: get discovered, and you\u2019re out. The Guardian\u2019s interaction with him was conducted in tightest security. He asked only to be referred to as \u201cM\u201d \u2013 the abbreviation of his male name that is in itself known only to very few. He also declined to discuss certain aspects of his story, such as the shocking harassment he endured from a former skipper, on grounds that some of his aircrew might recognize the detail and draw conclusions. Over six years of military service, M has learned how to keep his head down and out of the spotlight. Despite two full tours of service fighting Isis in Iraq and Syria, many military awards and a spotless record, he has been forced to embrace secrecy. \u201cThe ban has made me very careful around my squadron and fellow aircrew, including my wardroom. I\u2019m exceedingly careful not to engage in discussion about the ban, or politics in general, and I keep my relationships with my peers strictly professional. I\u2019ve established myself as being \u2018very quiet\u2019, and my silence is now considered normal.\u201d Despite his male identity, others continue to know him as the \u201cfemale officer with the short haircut\u201d. He grits his teeth when at formal functions he\u2019s forced to wear women\u2019s dress uniform with its antiquated 17th-century pants with side buttons, distinct suit top and hat that bears no resemblance to the men\u2019s classic wide-brimmed sailor\u2019s hat. \u201cIt makes me feel like a fraud. I feel less and less like I\u2019m participating in the great traditions of the navy, and more like I\u2019m performing in costume. I\u2019m not the same man who just a month ago was in a flight suit like everyone else flying combat missions.\u201d There\u2019s another aspect of the double life M now lives under the ban. To those around him he is a demure, softly spoken, understated woman. Internally, he is a profoundly hurt and saddened man. In emails to the Guardian, he laments that were he to openly begin testosterone hormone replacement therapy he would be downed from aviation permanently. He describes as \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201cstone-aged\u201d the fact that US armed forces still classify gender dysphoria as a \u201cmental disorder\u201d. He is convinced that the most advantageous policy for the military would be the exact opposite of Trump\u2019s ban. Allowing M to transition would actually benefit the navy because he could fulfill his potential in service to the nation. \u201cI think my service would be even better if I didn\u2019t have the anxiety of keeping closeted hanging over me,\u201d he said. At the root of it all, he thinks, is the ignorance and fear of the American public towards trans people. \u201cSo often, transgender individuals are made out to be these \u2018scary\u2019 concepts in faraway cities that you hear about on the news but have never met in real life. People \u2013 both civilian and military \u2013 need to realize that we are people too and make huge sacrifices that they would never dream of.\u201d Jennifer, US air force, flight engineer, trans woman The mood has darkened in Jennifer\u2019s command since the ban came in. A master sergeant and flight engineer in the air force, she has noticed that leadership in the higher ranks have started to pursue witch-hunts seeking to detect and remove trans individuals from the service. At lower levels, the climate has grown even uglier. \u201cThose who were against us have become far more outspoken about how we don\u2019t belong,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s as though in this extremely transphobic environment they feel they have to bash trans military members merely to fit in.\u201d US air force flying operations have always been among the most hostile corners of the military for trans people. Even during the brief three-year period under Obama when restrictions were generally loosened, being outed in the air force would still cost aircrew their wings. That prohibition is toughened under the new ban, with the added burden that verbal abuse surrounding it has intensified. When someone has the temerity to come out as trans in the air force, Jennifer said, news spreads quickly, they are promptly removed from flying status and they are branded in mess-room banter as \u201cnon-mission hackers\u201d and \u201closers\u201d. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if they have an exemplary past record or that they are devoted to flying and deploying. None of that positive information gets out. All that is discussed is that they are trans and they don\u2019t belong.\u201d Jennifer knows that the same brutal logic applies to her. As a trans woman who is required to be scrupulously male on base, it doesn\u2019t matter that she has had an exemplary career in the air force spanning more than 20 years. It doesn\u2019t matter that she\u2019s flown more than 6,000 hours being qualified on several different aircraft and has been honored with more than 20 ribbons and medals. \u201cIf I were found out by even one person, that would be the end of my flying career,\u201d she said. So, like M, she is very strict about security and keeping her womanhood secret. Since the ban kicked in, she said, \u201cI have become far more guarded and watch everything I do, from my mannerisms to managing when I exercise and shower, where I go off-base after work and how I dress. I cannot ever let my guard down.\u201d She avoids alcohol for fear that it might lull her into disclosing personal information. She wears baggy clothes to hide her physique. She preplans every move she makes and thinks constantly that the sacred trust of those around her, the trust upon which the US military is founded, would instantly be eviscerated if anybody discovered her true self. And yet her devotion to the air force remains constant. At times, though, she admitted, \u201cmy drive does take a hit when I am willing to die for freedoms others enjoy but I am being denied\u201d. She added: \u201cI love my country and it\u2019s people, even the ones who think I should be banned. I believe if they just had a chance to meet one of us and realize we are normal people trying to live our life, doing our best every day, they might change their mind.\u201d Caleb, US navy, aircrewman, trans man Caleb is a petty officer who serves as a naval aircrewman, operating equipment in tactical missions around the world. He is the only one of the four service members profiled here to take advantage of a little known caveat within Trump\u2019s trans ban known as the \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d. It allows people who were already in the armed forces and who acquired a diagnosis of gender dysphoria before the ban kicked in on 12 April to carry on serving in their correct gender. In other words, if you could get a military doctor officially to record your trans status in time, you could avoid the prohibition. The clause sparked a frantic scramble by Caleb and many like him to secure a diagnosis by the deadline. Assigned female at birth, he is desperate to transition and is keen to start hormone replacement therapy and surgery. But he is also desperate to hang on to his flight status and with it the valued role he so dearly loves that has taken him on numerous combat missions to Syria and other conflict zones. As he put it to the Guardian from his current deployment overseas: \u201cIt may be cheesy but every day when I walk on the flightline my pride surges. Often I look out the window over places I never dreamed I\u2019d see.\u201d Applying for a diagnosis against the clock was hair-raising in itself. There was a long waiting list to see the one doctor at the behavioral health unit in his command who treats trans patients. As the deadline approached, he took the hazardous step of visiting the general medical clinic to lobby staff for a rapid diagnosis. That was risky as it involved coming out as a trans man to people he did not know and could not necessarily trust. Clinic workers were suspicious that he was seeking diagnosis as a ruse to shirk deployment. That really irked him, as the truth was precisely the reverse: he was delaying transition and potentially harming his own health so that he could carry on flying tactical missions. By the time he finally got to see the doctor and have a diagnosis written into his record, it was with only days to spare. He squeaked through, along with up to 2,000 other trans service members who SPART*A estimates have been grandfathered in. You might think that qualifying for the clause, and with it an exemption from the ban, would be the end of Caleb\u2019s troubles. Not so. Though he has formally been recognized as a trans person, he feels far too unsettled by what has happened to go ahead with transition. \u201cOn paper I\u2019m safe from the ban, but I\u2019m nervous that if I come out now I might lose my chance to fly. It would only take one person in my chain of command who doesn\u2019t agree with transgender people being in the military for me to potentially be taken off deployments.\u201d To add to the jitters, the Pentagon made clear in the memo setting out the ban that the grandfather clause is legally tentative. The memo explicitly threatens that were the clause ever used to challenge the ban in court, then it would automatically be scrapped and everyone who had enjoyed its protection would immediately be expelled. That leaves Caleb in uncharted territory. \u201cI am proceeding with caution and being careful about coming out,\u201d he said. He remains closeted to all but a very few. He secretly binds his chest as one small concession to his authentic male identity, but wears his hair longer than he would choose to avoid attracting attention. While he is delaying taking hormones to start medical transition because he fears it might lead to him being taken off flight status, he is grateful that being grandfathered in at least gives him the choice eventually to be openly trans while still remaining in the military. He says that makes him feel lucky. He was also pleasantly surprised that when he privately came out to two co-workers recently they were generous and supportive. That has given him hope that one day he might be liberated without utterly being ostracized by those around him. For now, though, he remains trapped in limbo. \u201cI\u2019m having to choose between serving my country in the job I love and being myself, and it\u2019s really tough.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Tower blocks across England have been lit up in a series of guerrilla projections highlighting a national fire safety crisis that appears to be getting worse rather than better on the eve of the second anniversary of the Grenfell disaster. As night fell on Wednesday, buildings in London, Greater Manchester and Newcastle were illuminated with messages up to 12 storeys high warning that two years after the fire that killed 72 people, they are still not fitted with sprinklers, feature defective fire doors or are wrapped in dangerous cladding. NV Buildings in Salford were illuminated with a message that read: \u201c2 years after Grenfell and this building is still covered in dangerous cladding. #DemandChange.\u201d A leaseholder, Peter Brown, said nearly 250 households faced a bill of nearly \u00a33m to make their homes safe, and families and children feared for their safety because the building was wrapped in combustible expanded polystyrene insulation. \u201c[The government response] has been too little, too late,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have shrugged off responsibility for hundreds, if not thousands of buildings that do not meet regulations and are not fit for purpose. Ultimately this is the government\u2019s responsibility.\u201d In London at Frinstead House on the Silchester estate, which neighbours Grenfell, the projection highlighted its lack of sprinklers. All new residential towers require them, but retrofitting is not mandatory. In Newcastle, Cruddas Park House, a council block of 159 households where there have been bin fires, was lit up with the message: \u201cThe fire doors in this building are still not fit for purpose.\u201d \u201cThis is not something we should have to fight for,\u201d said Hannah Reid, 24, a dental nurse on the estate. \u201cWe are afraid the same thing [as Grenfell] could happen to us. The demands of the people of Grenfell were ignored and the same thing is happening to us. Not just us but all across the country.\u201d The projections were organised by Grenfell United, which represents the bereaved and survivors of the 14 June 2017 tragedy, and comes amid growing concerns about high-rise safety two years after the worst loss of life in London since the second world war. In the past four months, only three of the privately owned housing high-rises found to be wrapped in Grenfell-style cladding have been fixed, leaving 146 still vulnerable, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government admitted this week. Applications for a \u00a3200m public fund to help replace dangerous Grenfell-style cladding on close to 100 private buildings where owners have refused to pay will not be accepted until the end of the summer at the earliest. Fifty-six of 158 social housing blocks have been fixed, but tens of thousands of people are likely to be living in buildings that remain at risk. Tests on other cladding materials such as high-pressure laminates that may prove to be combustible are yet to be completed, raising the prospect that more may need to be fixed. Fire risks presented by faults unrelated to cladding are emerging as a potentially bigger problem, with faulty fire-breaks, dangerous insulation, missing intumescent paint and wooden cladding emerging as risks on 14 blocks in Manchester alone. It has also emerged that MPs warned ministers in 2014 not to dismiss warnings about the safety of combustible cladding panels and the need for sprinklers in case \u201ca major fire tragedy, with loss of life [should] occur\u201d. The chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on fire safety and rescue, David Amess, told Stephen Williams, then the communities minister, that he was \u201cat a loss to understand, how you had concluded that credible and independent evidence which had life safety implications, was not considered to be urgent\u201d, according to letters obtained by Inside Housing magazine. The MPs raised further concerns in 2016 and 2017 about the government\u2019s failure to review fire safety regulations following the 2009 Lakanal House fire, which killed six people. They wrote several times to Theresa May\u2019s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, then the housing minister, who admitted the review was taking too long. Karim Mussilhy, who lost his uncle Hesham Rahman in the Grenfell fire, warned \u201cthere are many other Grenfell Towers out there\u201d and in a statement directed at whoever becomes the next prime minister, said: \u201cYou have an opportunity to make changes that will echo throughout generations \u2026 that people are safe in their homes and are treated with respect and something like this will never happen again.\u201d The widening threat came into focus on Sunday when fire ripped through the facade of a Bellway Homes housing block in Barking, east London, reducing timber balconies to cinders. There were no deaths, but one building expert, Sam Webb, said that if it had happened during the night like at Grenfell, people could have died. None of the public funds so far made available are targeted at removing combustible materials other than aluminium composites. This week, leaseholders at the Skyline Central 1 tower in Manchester were handed bills of up to \u00a325,000 a flat to strip off and replace high-pressure laminate cladding. The building also has inadequate fire breaks built into its walls. Bills are as high as \u00a380,000 a household to fix Burton Place, another residential high-rise in Manchester, which has timber cladding and combustible insulation, which are not covered by public funds. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said building owners were primarily responsible for the safety of their buildings. It said it had stepped in to fully fund the replacement of unsafe ACM cladding on high-rise social and private residential properties where building owners have failed to do so and that interim steps had been taken to ensure that all buildings with ACM cladding were now safe.",

The goal for candidates is to amass a majority of delegates whose job it is to nominate the candidate. In some states, delegates are awarded on a winner-take-all basis; other states split their delegates proportionally among top winners.</p> <p>The goal for candidates is to win early-voting states and create name recognition and a sense of momentum. Sometimes the nominee emerges quickly, but the last two major Democratic primary contests, pitting Barack Obama against Clinton and then Sanders against Clinton, have lasted from the Iowa caucuses in January through late spring.</p> <h2>What\u2019s a caucus?</h2> <p>Most states hold primary elections, in which voters go to a polling place, mail in their ballots or otherwise vote remotely. But a handful of states hold caucuses, hours-long meetings with multiple rounds of balloting in which voters can switch sides until one candidate emerges as victor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9706b27c403204e8aeffec1286afbf6b1224b7e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9706b27c403204e8aeffec1286afbf6b1224b7e0/0_151_4096_2457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A volunteer brings a dog to a polling booth in Raleigh, North Carolina, on election day in 2016 to help de-stress voters\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A volunteer brings a dog to a polling booth in Raleigh, North Carolina, on election day in 2016 to help de-stress voters</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Caitlin Penna/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The primary season in the modern political era has typically begun with the Iowa caucuses followed by the primaries in New Hampshire and South Carolina and caucuses in Nevada.

A large cluster of states, 13, plus Democrats living abroad, will vote in primaries on so-called \u201cSuper Tuesday\u201d on 3 March 2020.

      "bodyText": "On 3 November 2020, Americans will head to the polls and render their verdict on the Donald Trump presidency. Here\u2019s your quick guide to what\u2019s in store. What\u2019s the 2020 election all about? In a word, Trump. Control of the US Congress, state legislatures and governorships are also in play. But the big question is whether the incumbent president can win re-election. All eyes are on the Democrats and the candidate they will nominate to take on Trump. In 2016, Trump pulled off a mammoth political upset against Hillary Clinton, taking swing states such as Florida and North Carolina while overcoming the Democrats\u2019 supposed \u201cblue wall\u201d in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. But this time the candidates are different, the issues are different and the electorate has changed. Can Trump do it again? The general election isn\u2019t just about the presidency, however. Democrats have a chance to take control of the US Senate from Republicans, with 34 out of 100 seats up for election and about a third of those looking competitive. Democrats also will try to defend their majority in the House of Representatives, where all 435 seats come up for re-election every two years. States will host legislative elections and 11 of them will hold elections for governor. Who can vote? There are more than 224 million people of voting age in the US. The 2020 electorate will be more diverse and younger than ever before, according to a January 2019 analysis from the Pew Research Center. Non-white voters will account for a third of eligible voters \u2013 their largest share ever \u2013 and one in 10 eligible voters will be of Generation Z (between ages 18 and 23). In 2016, about 30% of Americans who were eligible to vote decided not to or were blocked, but given the surge in turnout for the 2018 midterm elections, 2020 could see an expanded electorate. However, experts say voter suppression and gerrymandering may have hindered Democrats in 2018 and may continue to counter the effects of a more enthusiastic voting base. What\u2019s about to happen? The election cycle has been revving up since January 2019, when candidates started entering the race to be the Democratic party\u2019s nominee for president \u2013 ie the person to take on Trump. The president filed his paperwork to run for re-election on the day of his inauguration. More than 20 Democratic candidates \u2013 from the former vice-president Joe Biden to the 2016 insurgent candidate Bernie Sanders \u2013 have announced their intentions to run for the nomination, creating a crowded field with a record number of female contenders. Only one nominee will emerge from the Democratic side, although the race could be complicated by the entry of a third-party candidate. The first major test for the top 20 Democratic candidates will be the primary debates, the first of which will run over two consecutive nights in June. The primary debates are expected to run until there\u2019s a clear nominee. The Republican National Committee (RNC) nixed its debate committee in May 2018, signaling that it won\u2019t host any debates ahead of the primaries. Though Trump is not running entirely unopposed in the Republican primaries, the move is unsurprising given how much love the RNC has shown for the president. What are the primaries? The primaries and caucuses are a series of contests, in all 50 US states plus Washington DC and outlying territories, by which the party selects its presidential nominee. The goal for candidates is to amass a majority of delegates whose job it is to nominate the candidate. In some states, delegates are awarded on a winner-take-all basis; other states split their delegates proportionally among top winners. The goal for candidates is to win early-voting states and create name recognition and a sense of momentum. Sometimes the nominee emerges quickly, but the last two major Democratic primary contests, pitting Barack Obama against Clinton and then Sanders against Clinton, have lasted from the Iowa caucuses in January through late spring. What\u2019s a caucus? Most states hold primary elections, in which voters go to a polling place, mail in their ballots or otherwise vote remotely. But a handful of states hold caucuses, hours-long meetings with multiple rounds of balloting in which voters can switch sides until one candidate emerges as victor. The primary season in the modern political era has typically begun with the Iowa caucuses followed by the primaries in New Hampshire and South Carolina and caucuses in Nevada. That\u2019s why candidates spend so much time in those states in the lead-up to the first voting. Iowa will hold its caucuses on 3 February 2020. A large cluster of states, 13, plus Democrats living abroad, will vote in primaries on so-called \u201cSuper Tuesday\u201d on 3 March 2020. After that the identity of the nominee might be clear. The last primary season voting is scheduled to take place in Puerto Rico in early June. The Democratic national convention, where the nominee will be officially designated unless something very unusual happens, is scheduled for 13-16 July in Milwaukee. OK, then what? After the primaries, the two parties will hold their national conventions, at which they will officially designate their candidates. The conventions are a mix of political business, theater, and party in both senses of the word. Party delegates from across the country converge on a city, fill hotels, ballrooms, restaurants and bars, hold meetings and eventually fill a big arena to say something prideful about their state and cheer wildly for the nominee. It\u2019s more convenient for the party if the identity of that nominee is clear going in, but that\u2019s not been the case as recently as 1980. During the convention, politicians and/or celebrities give speeches in support of the party\u2019s candidate. The candidate gives a rousing speech. Lots of confetti and balloons will rain down, and someone like Alicia Keys or Demi Lovato might perform. It looks great on TV, as it\u2019s supposed to. The 2020 Democratic national convention will be held on 13-16 July in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, while the Republicans will hold theirs in Charlotte, North Carolina, on 24-27 August. Then it\u2019ll finally be election day, right? Not even close! The general election \u2013 the race for president that most voters think of, when and if they do \u2013 begins in earnest after the conventions. It\u2019s possible that a significant third-party candidate could enter the race and stay through the general election, as happened as recently as 2000. But with two major party candidates now squared off, the game is to identify the places to campaign and the voters to chase and then to do that on as much donor cash, little sleep and as much road food as possible. The candidates will choose and unveil running mates. They will reap endorsements and deploy surrogates surely including, on the Democratic side, the Obamas. There will be a series of presidential TV debates. Trump will also have the business of the presidency to attend to. Then 3 November 2020 will come, Americans will cast their votes and it will all come down to the electoral college. How does the electoral college work? The electoral college is the name for the voting system that determines who will be president of the United States. Each of the 50 states plus Washington DC is given a specific number of electoral votes \u2013 538 votes in total \u2013 based on their number of congressional districts, which in turn are based on population counts. California has 55 electoral votes, the most of any state, while states with just one US representative wield three electoral votes.

      "bodyText": "The Hungarian government is moving to bring the country\u2019s umbrella scientific research organisation under its control, in what scientists in the country and globally say would be an unprecedented assault on academic freedoms. The far-right, anti-migration government of Viktor Orb\u00e1n has sought to increase its control over numerous sectors of society since it came into office in 2010, including putting financial pressure on independent media outlets, harassing and taxing NGOs that work on issues such as migration, and moving to centralise historical research. Most notably, the Central European University, an English-language institution founded by the Hungarian-American philanthropist George Soros, is being forced to move some of its operations to Vienna after a long battle with the government. The country\u2019s Academy of Sciences appears to be the latest target for increased state control. The academy consists of a society of distinguished scientists and intellectuals, alongside a broad research network of 15 institutes and 150 research groups comprising about 3,000 scientific researchers. The government\u2019s plan would separate these institutes from the main academy, and create a governing board in which government-appointed delegates would have a majority. Parliament, which is dominated by Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party, is currently debating the bill. It is expected to be passed and come into force by 1 September. Hungarian government officials say it is reasonable for the government to have a say in how state funding is used. \u201cThe academy of sciences is a sovereign institution, but not independent from national interests,\u201d said the foreign minister, P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3, at a conference in Bratislava last week. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that they should make research in areas and directions which are important from the perspective of the future competitiveness of the country.\u201d Scientists at the academy, however, believe the move is punishment for criticism of the Orb\u00e1n government made by social science researchers. \u201cWe were never afraid to criticise the government if research showed policies that were problematic,\u201d said Emese Szil\u00e1gyi, who coordinates an institute representing researchers at the academy. \u201cThe illiberal government here has reorganised many sectors already and it\u2019s clear that this attack against the academy fits into a chain of events.\u201d She said the vast majority of academy employees were against the plan and said they would use \u201cevery available option\u201d to try to stop it from taking effect. L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Palkovics, Hungary\u2019s minister for trade and industry, has previously criticised the academy for straying into politics. \u201cTheir job is to give scientific advice and recommendations,\u201d he said in an interview with a pro-government web portal last year. \u201cIn some cases the academy has moved towards being politically active and this is not their task.\u201d L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Lov\u00e1sz, a mathematician and the president of the academy, said there was a misunderstanding about the role of social sciences among government figures, and said criticism was legitimate if evidence-based research ended up suggesting government policy was flawed. \u201cResearch in sociology, economics, political science, can have criticism concerning certain policies, and I think it\u2019s reasonable for the government to listen to this criticism. That is different from politics where you try to change the government,\u201d he said at a press conference held at the academy\u2019s grand building in central Budapest on Wednesday. Lov\u00e1sz said while social sciences could be the most affected by the plan, natural science could also suffer, and the shakeup would make long-term research projects and \u201cany research beyond government priorities increasingly difficult to follow\u201d. He said trust had been eroded by the aggressive and \u201cimproper\u201d way in which the government had conducted negotiations with the academy. He said the initial decision to reorganise the academy\u2019s finances was communicated by email a year ago, and the academy was given just 54 minutes in which to respond. Antonio Loprieno, the president of the European Federation of Academies of Sciences and Humanities, said it was acceptable for a government to set broad parameters for research spending, but the Hungarian law was clearly aimed at giving the government \u201can inappropriate level of detail\u201d in control over research. Loprieno said the Hungarian government\u2019s moves were unprecedented in an EU country and a worrying sign of what might be tried by governments elsewhere. \u201cSo far we are not seeing it anywhere else, but it could happen in countries that are moving towards populist governments, where there is a disregard for science, and universities and scientific institutes could become targets,\u201d he said.",

Commissioned by New Zealand police at the cost of NZ$10,000 (A$9,500), the audit examined the recent boom of animal pictures, feel-good moments and memes used by police social media accounts. In slides obtained by the Otago Daily Times under the New Zealand equivalent of freedom of information legislation, the firm concluded the police were doing well, but should post more examples of officers doing work, and fewer \u201cpuppy pics\u201d. It also commended the AFP for its \u201chumour\u201d and \u201chumility\u201d on social media \u2013 published before the AFP conducted two raids on journalists last week. The overwhelmingly positive review, from firm Socialites, called NZ police a \u201cleading social media organisation\u201d. \u201cThe NZ Police do a consistent job of ensuring the tone is appropriate to the content,\u201d the report said. \u201cFor example, the tone is lighter if talking about cats being rescued and appropriately serious when it involves a crime.\u201d But the meme saturation of New Zealand and Australian police media has previously attracted criticism. In 2017, NZ police had to delete a tweet that joked about road deaths with a meme of Steve Carell from the US sitcom The Office on a weekend when nine people died. \u201cWhen you have to tell someone their family member has died in a crash,\u201d the caption read, above a gif of Carrell saying \u201cThis is the worst\u201d. It also apologised for praising a police officer who \u201ctook charge\u201d of \u201can internment camp for Japanese women and children\u201d on International Women\u2019s Day this year. But the 19-slide report did not mention these gaffes, and commended the police Twitter account for \u201cexcellent use of social media self-referential content such as #flatlay \u2013 great for viral pick up.\u201d However, it did say that police media should reduce the proportion of puppies in its posts. \u201cAs we know this is a regular discussion point at police, we\u2019ve also addressed puppies,\u201d it said. \u201cPuppy pics and humorous/humanising content should definitely stay as part of the content\u2026[but] a greater proportion of operational stories will help further build trust &amp; confidence.\u201d In a series of comparisons, it said NZ police had a better social media presence than Fire &amp; Emergency New Zealand, the New Zealand Defence Force and Corrections NZ. It said the Australian federal police were \u201cthe closest example\u201d of another government agency that used \u201chumour and humility\u201d as well as NZ police. Paul Halford, NZ police\u2019s national manager of communications, said social media played an important role in public trust and \u201chelping people be safe\u201d. \u201cMost New Zealanders do not have face-to-face interactions with police officers \u2026 a lot of the information they get about what New Zealand police are doing is online,\u201d he said. \u201cThe purpose of the audit was to evaluate how NZ Police are performing in the social media space, and how it aligns with supporting our business objectives, especially building trust and confidence in the police.

The Australian Conservation Foundation said the Queensland government had \u201cput politics ahead of science\u201d. Approval of the groundwater plans follows intense pressure on the Queensland government after swings to the LNP in Queensland at the federal election. After Labor\u2019s loss, Palaszczuk set deadlines for the two final-state approvals the mining company needed to begin preliminary construction at the mine site in the Galilee Basin. The first was Adani\u2019s management plan for the black-throated finch, which was approved at the end of May. The second was its groundwater management plans, which received a rushed federal approval immediately before the election was called. Adani will now be able to begin preliminary work, such as land-clearing and road access development at its mine site. But it still requires other federal environmental approvals before it can begin extracting coal. Other aspects of the project, such as a royalties agreement, are also yet to be finalised. In its statement, the Department of Environment and Science said it gave its sign-off after receiving additional advice from the CSIRO and Geoscience Australia on 7 June. Based on this advice, the department said it was satisfied Adani had \u201csufficiently established\u201d the source aquifer of the Doongmabulla Springs as the Clematis Sandstone. Adani\u2019s failure to identify the source aquifer has been one of the problems identified in previous versions of its groundwater work. \u201cDES has required additional commitments from Adani to undertake further scientific work over the next two years,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThis is required to identify any potential contribution from other aquifers and strengthen the GDEMP.\u201d This includes further work to understand source aquifers for springs in the vicinity of the mine, including the Doongmabulla springs complex, conducting hydrogeochemical analysis of groundwater and spring samples from different springs, and examining core samples from new bores to better understand their hydraulic properties and provide detailed geological mapping. Former environment minister Melissa Price signed off on the groundwater plans despite concerns raised by the CSIRO and Geoscience Australia. The agencies\u2019 review of the plans found that Adani\u2019s groundwater models were \u201cnot suitable\u201d to ensure the conditions of its environmental approvals were met and that it underestimated how much water the project would draw from the ancient Doongmabulla Springs complex and the Carmichael River. Adani has been granted permission to re-run its groundwater models two years after mining commences. It has also been asked to address some of the issues the CSIRO raised with its groundwater plans in two research plans associated with the Great Artesian Basin that the federal government still needs to assess. A decision on those research plans will now fall to the new environment minister, Sussan Ley. But, in a win for environmentalists this week, the federal government conceded in a legal challenge related to another aspect of Adani\u2019s project, its north Galilee water scheme. The government approved the infrastructure project last year that would see a 100km-long pipeline constructed to transport 12.5bn litres of water a year from the Suttor River and Burdekin basin.

In it, she reads from her essay Portrait of Diego, which was taken from the catalogue of a 1949 exhibition at the Palace of Fine Arts, celebrating 50 years of Rivera\u2019s work. \u201cHe is a gigantic, immense child, with a friendly face and a sad gaze,\u201d she says, as translated by Agence France-Presse. (A different English translation of the text can be found on Google Arts &amp; Culture.) \u201cHis high, dark, extremely intelligent and big eyes rarely hold still. They almost come out of their sockets because of their swollen and protuberant eyelids \u2013 like a toad\u2019s. They allow his gaze to take in a much wider visual field, as if they were built especially for a painter of large spaces and crowds.\u201d It is estimated that the recording was made in 1953 or 1954. In the press release, Mexico\u2019s secretary of culture, Alejandra Frausto, said if it is indeed Kahlo\u2019s voice \u2013 a claim which authorities continue to investigate \u2013 it could be the only audio recording of the artist that exists. The library\u2019s role is to preserve and make public documentary sound archives for Mexico. Its collection, amassed over a decade, features the voices of some of the country\u2019s most important historical figures \u2013 but library national director P\u00e1vel Granados said Kahlo\u2019s voice was the \u201cmost requested and sought-after\u201d by visitors. \u201cFrida\u2019s voice has always been a great enigma, a never-ending search,\u201d Granados told a press conference. \u201cUntil now, there had never been a recording of Frida Kahlo.\u201d The radio show the recording was taken from, El Bachiller, was named for its host \u00c1lvaro G\u00e1lvez y Fuentes \u201cEl Bachiller\u201d, who has been described by the ministry of culture as \u201cthe main documentalist of the voices of his time\u201d. The sound library has 1,300 El Bachiller tapes among its collection, which will need to be digitised and cataloged in order to ascertain if more of Kahlo\u2019s voice is among them.",

Depending on who you ask, he either did the accepted NHL thing and challenged Lars Eller to a fair fight, or he \u201cjumped\u201d the unsuspecting Washington forward in a clear violation of the mythical \u201ccode\u201d that governs hockey fights. </p> <p>A couple of months later, Eller followed the \u201ccode\u201d and offered Marchand the chance to settle the matter with a mutually agreed-upon spell of fisticuffs. <a href=\"https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/capitals/rematch-wasnt-lars-eller-not-happy-brad-marchand-ducking-scrap\">Marchand declined</a>.

And November. And December. </p> <p>In the midst of those miserable three months, St. Louis fired coach Mike Yeo. Associate head coach Craig Berube was bumped up to interim head coach. </p> <p>Then everything changed. The Blues stormed their way up to third place in the Central Division. They took down division rival Winnipeg in the first round of the playoffs. Up next was Dallas, which had upset division champion Nashville. That series should give the Blues some Game 7 confidence -- St. Louis won on the road in overtime. San Jose fell next, and the Blues had completed their surprising run to the final.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"665ae87f10c762863636fa4746b5a23b8bbb7ec6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/665ae87f10c762863636fa4746b5a23b8bbb7ec6/22_204_4093_2455/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jordan Binnington covers the puck under heavy pressure earlier in this series.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jordan Binnington covers the puck under heavy pressure earlier in this series.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bruce Bennett/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some of the credit for the turnaround surely goes to Berube, but the big story of the season is goaltender Jordan Binnington, who started the season as the backup -- on the minor-league San Antonio Rampage. The Blues called him up to the NHL in December. He had appeared in the NHL only one time in his career, a 13- minute stint in the 2015-16 season. </p> <p>Binnington wound up starting 30 games for the Blues this season. He finished with 24 wins, a goals-against average of 1.89 and a save percentage of 92.7%.</p> <p>It\u2019s safe to say few people expected the Blues to be here.

But they rebounded to win consistently, not losing a single game in regulation in February. </p> <p>The Bruins were always looking up at Tampa Bay in the Atlantic Division as the Lightning lapped the field in the regular season.

The NBA and WNBA offer plenty of chances for instant redemption -- a player can shoot 30% from the field and still be the hero. The Super Bowl proceeds through dozens of discrete plays. The World Series plays out at a more languid pace. </p> <p><em>Maybe </em>an international soccer final -- a World Cup or a Champions League -- provides the same frayed nerves as a final battle for the Stanley Cup. A single defensive mistake or a single squandered opportunity can ruin a team\u2019s chances. </p> <p>But Game 7 of a hockey playoff series, particularly the final, takes all of that pressure and condenses it onto a small sheet of ice. Scoring chances can take place at each end, separated only by a couple of seconds. </p> <p>And fans know as well as the players that these opportunities don\u2019t come around often. Having the league\u2019s top record, for which a team claims the less-storied Presidents\u2019 Trophy, is often a curse. The Washington Capitals took that prize three times in eight seasons but only won their first Stanley Cup in team history last year, when they were nowhere near the top of the league. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f2cd88713e609060f97527397980028094a1813\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f2cd88713e609060f97527397980028094a1813/0_15_2188_1313/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Ovechkin lifts the best trophy in sports after winning last year in Las Vegas.

      "bodyText": "You can read the full report for tonight\u2019s game here. Cup, meet Arch You can just imagine photographers figuring out the best way to get an iconic photo of the Cup under the Gateway Arch. For the players, nothing will top lifting it a few minutes after a stunning win in which an inexperienced goaltender held a potent attack at bay to give his team a chance to score four opportunistic goals. Thanks for following along with us. Hockey resumes in September. See you then. Held up by an audio problem in which we couldn\u2019t hear NHL commissioner Gary Bettman over the boos. The third goal ... The Bruins never recovered. For mathematicians ... First time for a team that started play in 1967. For the second straight year, we have a first-time winner of the Cup. And like the Capitals last year, they did it on the road. Bruins 1-4 Blues, 1:14, 3rd period The Blues flirt with the empty net, but it goes just wide for an icing call. But it\u2019s academic at this point. We won\u2019t get the thrill of a one-goal final in the final minute. Fans are on their way out. Late consolation as a shot takes an odd spinning motion that fools Binnington. Bruins 0-4 Blues, 2:20, 3rd period Rask is disconsolate on the bench. He can\u2019t blame himself. The Blues made four fantastic plays at his end of the ice. And as well as Binnington has played, many of those shots were straight at him. The Blues have managed to outshoot the Bruins in this period. Bruins 0-4 Blues, 4:00, 3rd period The Bruins have pulled the goalie. Empty net. Ironically, Zach Sanford hails from Manchester, N.H., and played at Boston College. Now he has surely put the Bruins\u2019 faint hopes to bed. That should do it. A few nifty moves by David Perron, who then dinks the puck across the crease to Zach Sanford, who happily taps it in. Bruins 0-3 Blues, 5:09, 3rd period In the regular season, a team will shrug off a game like this. Not our night. Hot goalie. Got another game on Friday. This is Game 7 of the Stanley Cup final. (Which I\u2019m sure you knew. And the Bruins certainly know.) The back-breaker for the Bruins ... It\u2019s not over, but the Bruins need a breakthrough in a hurry. The Ozzy tweet reminded me of Mike Levine, the bassist for power trio Triumph, who was known for rocking a Blues jersey. Again, I have no fashion sense, but that\u2019s a cool shirt. Oh, and we did see a replay of what happened a few minutes ago -- Binnington was out in front of the crease but managed to stretch his right leg back to get a pad on a shot. Unreal. The TD Garden has fallen silent. Terasenko hustles to win the puck deep in the zone, looks back and sees Brayden Schenn streaking down the middle. Pass, shot, inside of post, goal, and the Bruins are in a deep hole. Bruins 0-2 Blues, 9:37, 3rd period Would you guys please ice the puck so we can see a replay of what happened 90 seconds ago? Bruins 0-2 Blues, 11:07, 3rd period What just happened??!!! It involved Binnington and a rip in the time-space continuum. It\u2019s still 0-2. Bruins 0-2 Blues, 12:37, 3rd period St. Louis ices the puck for the 3,000th time and wins free barbecue. I don\u2019t know what to say about this ... Bruins 0-2 Blues, 14:17, 3rd period A couple of bodies hit the ice, but it\u2019s all incidental contact. Remember to breath ... remember to breath ... Bruins 0-2 Blues, 15:18, 3rd period Rask comes up big to stop an odd-man rush. Then another save as Vladimir Terasenko swipes the puck on the left wing and bears down on the goal. Bruins 0-2 Blues, 18:54, 3rd period Boston has come out swinging, moving the puck around to set up a ferocious shot from Torey Krug. Third period underway ... Can the Blues really pull this off? Up 2-0 despite lopsided stats against them. Barkley\u2019s wardrobe is the subject of some discussion ... I have no fashion sense whatsoever, so I can\u2019t judge. But if you\u2019re curious, I\u2019m wearing a spiffy Trinity College Dublin T-shirt from my recent Ireland trip. Game 7 of Jim vs. Pam ... The first-intermission appearance of NBA analyst (and entertaining player in his day) Charles Barkley has drawn some perplexing reactions. An even and uneventful period. Mostly. The Blues had the best chance, with Zdeno Chara\u2019s miraculous intercession keeping the puck out after it hit the crossbar and dropped behind goalie Tuukka Rask. The Bruins had more shots, 11-6, but nothing that really troubled Binnington. The surprise: The Boston crowd has been virtually silenced. If you tuned in 10 minutes ago, you\u2019d never guess this was Game 7 of the Stanley Cup finals. Bruins 0-2 Blues, 2:29, 2nd period For the first time in this game, we have some close-range \u201cdiscussion\u201d during a stoppage. A Bruins forward got a little too close to Binnington after another save. Bruins 0-2 Blues, 3:45, 2nd period A long possession for Boston in the St. Louis zone. It ends with a slapshot and ... a glove save. We\u2019re probably jinxing him, but ... Bruins 0-2 Blues, 5:44, 2nd period An overhead view of the shot off the bar shows Zdeno Chara managed to get a stick behind his goalie to keep the puck from crossing the line. The Blues were a couple of inches away from 3-0. Bruins 0-2 Blues, 6:11, 2nd period Good work by the Bruins to free Marchand in the faceoff circle to Binnington\u2019s left. He shoots. Glove save. Bruins 0-2 Blues, 6:30, 2nd period St. Louis was in the ascendancy as Boston tried to regroup after nearly falling behind 0-3, but the Bruins have managed to get to the other end and fire a mildly dangerous shot at Binnington. Bruins 0-2 Blues, 9:30, 2nd period OFF THE BAR! WE need a replay to digest that. Rask made the save, and it bounced up, landed on the bar and dropped back down behind the Bruins goalie while the crowd gasped. Bruins 0-2 Blues, 11:15, 2nd period For all the talk of physicality in this series, this has been a low-key game in terms of collisions, intentional and unintentional. The only penalty was for delay of game when the puck popped into the stands. Bruins 0-2 Blues, 13:20, 2nd period NBC has a \u201cscoring chances\u201d stat. Currently 9-3 Boston. Bruins 0-2 Blues, 13:50, 2nd period The Blues still aren\u2019t generating a lot of chances, but they\u2019re showing more composure in their own zone and limiting the Bruins. It\u2019s not just Binnington at this point. Bruins 0-2 Blues, 14:52, 2nd period An even and uneventful start to the period. The Blues just got their first shot, a tame one, of the period. Bruins 0-2 Blues, 16:03, 2nd period An even and uneventful start to the period. This stoppage occurs when Binnington catches a low-percentage shot at an acute angle. Bruins 0-2 Blues, 17:38, 2nd period An even and uneventful start to the period. START OF SECOND PERIOD: Bruins 0-2 Blues The Blues start with a bit of offense but nothing too troubling. In St. Louis at the moment ... And for those who couldn\u2019t get in the Blues\u2019 arena, how about the Cardinals\u2019 ballpark? I often wonder how these gatherings affect the ratings. The Bruins has 12 shots on goal and forced St. Louis to block another 12. The Blues had four shots on goal and only two more blocked. The Blues lead 2-0. GOAL: Bruins 0-2 Blues, 0:07.9, 1st period (Pietrangelo 19:52) A steal by Jaden Schwartz, a nifty pass back to Pietrangelo, a backhand flip, and it\u2019s 2-0. Bruins 0-1 Blues, 1:12, 1st period Binnington is just a step ahead now. The Bruins try to wrap around the net, and he\u2019s waiting for them at the post. Bruins 0-1 Blues, 2:00, 1st period A break in the action while the Bruins try to shake off a stunner that has put them in a 1-0 hole. GOAL: Bruins 0-1 Blues, 3:13, 1st period (O\u2019Reilly, 16:47) That\u2019s what soccer people would call \u201cagainst the run of play.\u201d It started with a great hit deep in the Bruins zone by Sammy Blais. He then shot from a tough angle, the Blues\u2019 first shot in 16 minutes. The puck was cycled around to ageless defenseman Jay Bouwmeester. His slap shot gets a slight deflection off O\u2019Reilly and zips past Rask. Bruins 0-0 Blues, 5:17, 1st period The Blues finally manage to fling the puck in the general direction of the net, but it doesn\u2019t get through a thicket of Bruins legs. Bruins 0-0 Blues, 6:30, 1st period NBC gives us a good reminder -- the Blues had a shot on goal 27 seconds into the game. Not since then. For those who don\u2019t know hockey -- that\u2019s an eternity. The hits are getting a little tougher. Bruins 0-0 Blues, 8:24, 1st period HUGE SAVE: Johansson slaloms between the faceoff circle, dekes, and then is robbed by Binnington. The song was Raise Your Hands, by the way. One of the most cliched songs ever recorded. Boston has outshot St. Louis 7-1. Bruins 0-0 Blues, 9:23, 1st period Now we have a couple of stoppages. Hockey is funny like that -- five breathless minutes, then several breaks. Why would Boston play a bad Bon Jovi song during the break? That\u2019s a New Jersey band. I have a new Surface Pro. I hope it survives the night. Bruins 0-0 Blues, 10:03, 1st period PENALTY KILLED. But the Bruins certainly made Binnington work. Boston has all the momentum now. Bruins 0-0 Blues, 11:08, 1st period BIG SAVE: The Bruins move the puck from Binnington\u2019s left to the center, and the rookie goalie sprawls to stop the shot from the ever-dangerous Brad Marchand. POWER PLAY: Bruins 0-0 Blues, 12:03, 1st period It\u2019s delay of game on St. Louis\u2019 Colton Parayko, who flipped the puck into the stands under pressure. Can\u2019t do that. See you in two minutes Bruins 0-0 Blues, 12:08, 1st period A rare break in the action for an icing call, and we resume in the St. Louis zone, where we\u2019ve spent a lot of time in the past few minutes. Then a few more seconds with little happening, and finally a TV timeout. Phew! Can I do cricket next? Bruins 0-0 Blues, 12:35, 1st period Another good chance for the Bruins as Marcus Johansson (former Capital, then injured by Marchand while he was with the Devils) has a shot blocked and then has an open angle to the net, but he\u2019s unable to get his stick on it. Then a big save by Binnington just when the net seemed open. Bruins 0-0 Blues, 16:16, 1st period St. Louis still has the better of play, but the Bruins just had a good chance as Blues goalie Jordan Binnington gave up a rebound and Noel Acciari was able to take a swing at it. Bruins 0-0 Blues, 17:35, 1st period A sustained possession for St. Louis early, and Boston\u2019s Tuukka Rast makes the first save of the game. The fourth lines (not the scorers) start, and we get an icing call 10 seconds in. But Jenna Fischer is a Blues fan and was on the Game 6 broadcast, so there. This, though, is pretty cool. Another quick email before the puck drops, this one identified only as tony \u201cBoston boys watching in Southampton UK! Work going to be tough tomorrow. Actually maybe no work tomorrow!\u201d If the Bruins win, I doubt many people will go to work in Boston tomorrow as well. On the ice ... The Bruins take the ice to Audioslave\u2019s classic song, Cochise. Then everything will grind to a halt as they do a long introduction of the starting lineups, which are completely irrelevant in a sport in which the players change every 30-90 seconds, and then the national anthem. The case of the missing Cup Hockey lore is built around trophies, especially but not limited to the Stanley Cup, that are passed from winner to winner rather than kept in a trophy case. But that didn\u2019t happen in the third-tier ECHL. Depending on who you ask, the Colorado Eagles either didn\u2019t return it or had no opportunity to return it. The Eagles are now in the second-tier AHL. No, these leagues don\u2019t have promotion and relegation. They just shuffle around. And maybe they forget to return trophies. That\u2019s why the Newfoundland Growlers got a brand-new trophy upon winning the Cup, er, ECHL final. Emails, emails ... I\u2019m hearing from people in the UK who are probably trying to stay awake by chatting with me. Lee Madden: \u201cI\u2019m waiting up to watch what I hope will be an epic game 7 in the Stanley cup. I must be one of the few hockey fans in the uk they genuinely just wants a cracking game with loads of saves, goals and hits ... and given that I\u2019m Irish, a Boston victory ... what do you reckon?\u201d Probably a lot of hits. Andrew Benton: \u201cWhat, no mouth guards in ice hockey? How come?\u201d Some wear them, some don\u2019t, though I wish I had never read these words: \u201cI\u2019ve pulled teeth out of mouth guards.\u201d Boston\u2019s championship run(s) Current champions in U.S. sports ... MLB: Boston Red Sox NFL: New England Patriots (technically a good ways south of Boston) So the city of outstanding educational institutions and a bunch of cavemen on sports talk radio could have three U.S. sports champions at the same time. But ... NBA: Golden State Warriors (for at least another day or so) WNBA: Seattle Storm MLS: Atlanta United NWSL: North Carolina Courage NWHL: Minnesota Whitecaps AFL: Washington Valor National Lacrosse League: Calgary Roughnecks Major League Lacrosse: Denver Outlaws Major League Rugby: Seattle Seawolves American Ultimate Disc League: Madison Radicals So don\u2019t let any Boston people push you around tomorrow. On the pregame show (on NBCSN), we\u2019re hearing that Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy figures they can be as physical as they wanna be because no one can get suspended for any more games. Maybe they\u2019ll get 20 games to start the next season? Hero/villain: Brad Marchand In the first game of the season, with the Bruins suffering a 7-0 defeat in Washington, Brad Marchand had enough of the Capitals\u2019 celebrations. Depending on who you ask, he either did the accepted NHL thing and challenged Lars Eller to a fair fight, or he \u201cjumped\u201d the unsuspecting Washington forward in a clear violation of the mythical \u201ccode\u201d that governs hockey fights. A couple of months later, Eller followed the \u201ccode\u201d and offered Marchand the chance to settle the matter with a mutually agreed-upon spell of fisticuffs. Marchand declined. The \u201ccode\u201d-keepers can\u2019t be happy about that. None of this behavior is surprising to those who know Marchand. He\u2019s no stranger to suspensions and fines, getting a five-game break for a nasty elbow to the head of Marcus Johansson -- who, ironically, joined the Bruins this spring. He narrowly avoided a suspension earlier in the playoffs. Oh, by the way, he\u2019s the top scorer (goals plus assists) in the playoffs this year. And THAT can hurt any opponent. The Blues\u2019 path In October, the Blues were well of the pace. And November. And December. In the midst of those miserable three months, St. Louis fired coach Mike Yeo. Associate head coach Craig Berube was bumped up to interim head coach. Then everything changed. The Blues stormed their way up to third place in the Central Division. They took down division rival Winnipeg in the first round of the playoffs. Up next was Dallas, which had upset division champion Nashville. That series should give the Blues some Game 7 confidence -- St. Louis won on the road in overtime. San Jose fell next, and the Blues had completed their surprising run to the final. Some of the credit for the turnaround surely goes to Berube, but the big story of the season is goaltender Jordan Binnington, who started the season as the backup -- on the minor-league San Antonio Rampage. The Blues called him up to the NHL in December. He had appeared in the NHL only one time in his career, a 13- minute stint in the 2015-16 season. Binnington wound up starting 30 games for the Blues this season. He finished with 24 wins, a goals-against average of 1.89 and a save percentage of 92.7%. It\u2019s safe to say few people expected the Blues to be here. And no one could have expected Binnington. The Bruins\u2019 path The first game of Boston\u2019s season was inauspicious. They sat around while the Washington Capitals raised the Stanley Cup banner in a long ceremony, then got blown off the ice in a 7-0 rout. (Your correspondent for the evening was there.) But they rebounded to win consistently, not losing a single game in regulation in February. The Bruins were always looking up at Tampa Bay in the Atlantic Division as the Lightning lapped the field in the regular season. But that Presidents\u2019 Trophy was again a curse, and Tampa Bay was swept by Columbus in the first round. The Capitals also faltered, losing to the Carolina Hurricanes. Boston had a difficult time with Toronto in the first round, winning Game 6 on the road and finishing off the Maple Leafs in Game 7 -- the same path they\u2019re hoping to follow in this final. But with Tampa Bay and Washington out, the Bruins just needed to beat wild-card teams Columbus and Carolina. They swept the latter and had time to rest up for the final. Game 7 A pressure-cooker of this intensity is difficult to find. We don\u2019t see it in other sports. The NBA and WNBA offer plenty of chances for instant redemption -- a player can shoot 30% from the field and still be the hero. The Super Bowl proceeds through dozens of discrete plays. The World Series plays out at a more languid pace. Maybe an international soccer final -- a World Cup or a Champions League -- provides the same frayed nerves as a final battle for the Stanley Cup. A single defensive mistake or a single squandered opportunity can ruin a team\u2019s chances. But Game 7 of a hockey playoff series, particularly the final, takes all of that pressure and condenses it onto a small sheet of ice. Scoring chances can take place at each end, separated only by a couple of seconds. And fans know as well as the players that these opportunities don\u2019t come around often. Having the league\u2019s top record, for which a team claims the less-storied Presidents\u2019 Trophy, is often a curse. The Washington Capitals took that prize three times in eight seasons but only won their first Stanley Cup in team history last year, when they were nowhere near the top of the league. The Boston Bruins have been here many times and have the opportunity to win for the seventh time. The St. Louis Blues have waited even longer than the Capitals for that breakthrough championship and haven\u2019t been in the final in nearly 50 years. If you\u2019re a fan of one of these teams, this will be a stressful 150 minutes, if not more. If you\u2019re a neutral, this will be a thrill. (And I\u2019m going to guess you have at least a slight preference for the Blues. We all love seeing teams get that rare shot at glory, right?) Buckle up. This is going to be fun. Beau will be here shortly. In the meantime, here\u2019s how Game 6 went down: Tuukka Rask made 28 saves, Brad Marchand had a goal and an assist, and the Boston Bruins beat the St Louis Blues 5-1 on Sunday night to even the bruising, physical Stanley Cup final at three games apiece. David Pastrnak had one of Boston\u2019s four goals in the third period and an assist, helping the Bruins force the 17th Game 7 in Stanley Cup history. Brandon Carlo, Karson Kuhlman and Zdeno Chara also scored. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting for our lives obviously,\u201d Marchand said. \u201cWhen you play desperate, I think you see everyone\u2019s best game.\u201d Boston also were involved in the final\u2019s last Game 7, winning the championship at Vancouver in 2011. Rask was a reserve goaltender on that team eight years ago, while Marchand was a key performer. They will go for another championship on Wednesday night in Boston after losing to Chicago in the 2013 final. \u201cThe whole hockey world loves a Game 7, so it should be a great night in Boston and may the best team win,\u201d Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy said.",

      "bodyText": "The Oscar-winning actor Mira Sorvino has said she is a survivor of date rape, saying she was talking about it publicly to lend her voice to a push for stronger sexual assault laws in New York. Sorvino, who was one of the first women to accuse the film producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment, spoke during a news conference with New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, in support of the push to drop the statute of limitations on rape allegations. Sorvino acknowledged that talking publicly about Weinstein\u2019s alleged misconduct had been traumatic, saying: \u201cI had not really sought out the help I needed\u201d, but revealed she had another previously undisclosed experience with a man she did not identify. \u201cI can stand here before you and say not only was I a sexual harassment and battery victim at the hands of Mr Weinstein, but I\u2019m also a sexual assault victim and I\u2019m also a survivor of date rape.\u201d Sorvino said she wouldn\u2019t go into details, but wanted to disclose the assault to help others. \u201cI am doing it here to try and help, because there are all these survivors out there right now who need justice, who need to feel that they can take the time they need to sort through the trauma, to sort through the shame,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I can tell you in situations of second degree rape, which is what mine would constitute, you feel ashamed. You feel that somehow it was your fault.\u201d In New York, second-degree rape involves victims who cannot consent to sexual activity, either because of their age, mental capacity or state of inebriation. Advocates want lawmakers to repeal the state\u2019s statute of limitations for second- and third-degree rape and change the law to make it easier for victims to prove harassment claims. Cuomo, a Democrat, thanked Sorvino for being \u201cbrave and courageous\u201d after listening to her speak. In 2018, Sorvino \u2013 the star of Mighty Aphrodite \u2013 alleged Weinstein had sexually harassed her when they worked on a project together in 1995. The filmmaker Peter Jackson later said that Weinstein had allegedly told him not to consider her for a role in The Lord of the Rings because she was difficult to work with. A spokesperson for Weinstein denied he had any input on casting choices. Sorvino is one of more than 80 women who have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct. In May it was reported that Weinstein reached a tentative $44m deal to resolve several lawsuits and compensate women who have accused him of sexual misconduct. He still faces criminal charges of rape and performing a forcible sex act, and is set to go on trial in New York in September. He denies all allegations of non-consensual sex.",

Defeat to Brazil and one of Australia\u2019s finest crops of players and the world\u2019s No 6 side are staring at group stage elimination. Win, and the Milicic revolution has space to breathe fresh impetus into the campaign.</p> <p>FFA top brass rolled the dice when they sacked Alen Stajcic months out from a World Cup campaign. The wisdom of their decision, in the eyes of many, will be confirmed solely through performances on the pitch.</p> <p>It\u2019s arguably one of the Matildas\u2019 most important games ever \u2013 and the subplots are plentiful. One major question is who will start at left-back. With Clare Polkinghorne reporting muscle tightness following the match against Italy, and Laura Alleway withdrawn from the squad, the Matildas are down to one recognised fully-fit centre-back.</p> <p>It\u2019s a nightmarish scenario with roots deep in the underinvestment in women\u2019s football below the elite level and a lack of competitive opportunity outside the W-League. For a nation with a seeming production line of no-nonsense centre-backs, all of a sudden there is no one to fit the bill.</p> <p>Veteran former captain Polkinghorne trained separately from the group on Wednesday, walking laps before testing her hamstring with some medium-pace sprints. It\u2019s a sore point for coach Milicic, who claimed Polkinghorne had to perform over 300m of unnecessary high-velocity sprints during the match due to Fifa rule changes that encourage linesmen to keep their flags down, following the introduction of VAR at this World Cup.</p> <p>Should Polkinghorne not be fit, vice-captain Steph Catley is the likely replacement in the heart of defence. As Australia\u2019s pre-eminent left-back for the past six years, it creates a lottery as to who comes in at full-back. Gema Simon, utility Amy Harrison, or even youngster Karly Roestbakken could all be in the frame.</p> <p>Milicic hinted at changes to personnel to best counter Brazil\u2019s attacking threats, which almost certainly points to a return of Elise Kellond-Knight into the Matildas\u2019 engine room. With Brazil\u2019s coach Vad\u00e3o employing a 4-4-2 there are pockets of space to exploit in front of the defence \u2013 an area Milicic has experimented with, with Caitlin Foord fulfilling the role of playmaker.</p> <p>\u201cI feel with Kellond-Knight coming back into the squad that\u2019s very important for us because she\u2019s a real natural No 6 and a lot of the good play that we do have, or we\u2019ve had in the past anyway, goes through her.\u201d</p> <p>Once again Milicic confirmed his commitment to an attacking style of football, even though the attacking personnel of Brazil makes this a high-risk strategy.</p> <p>\u201cWe understand they want to use their individual skills, they like to play when the game is stretched,\u201d Milicic said. \u201cThey are strong in transition \u2026 so what\u2019s important for us against an opposition like them, is that we really keep to our shape and we keep our structure really well and with discipline. We don\u2019t want an end-to-end game, an open game.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/12/usa-thailand-womens-world-cup-soccer-celebrations\">The US scoring 13 against Thailand was great, the celebrations were not | Hope Solo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As Catley confirmed, with the mooted return of six-times world player of the year, Marta, to bolster the Brazilian attack already including hat-trick star Cristiane who spearheaded the win over Jamaica, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/12/matildas-rivalry-with-brazil-resurfaces-with-all-still-to-play-for\">Australia\u2019s historical rivals</a> are set to only be more formidable.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve played against Marta a lot, I\u2019ve played with her, so I suppose I know how she plays a little better than I know Cristiane,\u201d Catley said. \u201cBoth are players individually full of flair and skill, they can turn it on at any point, so [it is important] just being switched on at all times during an entire game.\u201d</p> <p>It has been over a decade since the Matildas lost four games in a row. And with the stakes involved Milicic could be forgiven for abandoning his attacking mantra in a game of this importance. But like Caesar, urging his troops on in the face of civil discord, sometimes courage alone can win the day. We\u2019ll know soon enough if this is Australian women\u2019s football\u2019s Rubicon moment.</p>",

Win, and the Milicic revolution has space to breathe fresh impetus into the campaign. FFA top brass rolled the dice when they sacked Alen Stajcic months out from a World Cup campaign. The wisdom of their decision, in the eyes of many, will be confirmed solely through performances on the pitch. It\u2019s arguably one of the Matildas\u2019 most important games ever \u2013 and the subplots are plentiful. One major question is who will start at left-back. With Clare Polkinghorne reporting muscle tightness following the match against Italy, and Laura Alleway withdrawn from the squad, the Matildas are down to one recognised fully-fit centre-back. It\u2019s a nightmarish scenario with roots deep in the underinvestment in women\u2019s football below the elite level and a lack of competitive opportunity outside the W-League. For a nation with a seeming production line of no-nonsense centre-backs, all of a sudden there is no one to fit the bill. Veteran former captain Polkinghorne trained separately from the group on Wednesday, walking laps before testing her hamstring with some medium-pace sprints. It\u2019s a sore point for coach Milicic, who claimed Polkinghorne had to perform over 300m of unnecessary high-velocity sprints during the match due to Fifa rule changes that encourage linesmen to keep their flags down, following the introduction of VAR at this World Cup. Should Polkinghorne not be fit, vice-captain Steph Catley is the likely replacement in the heart of defence. As Australia\u2019s pre-eminent left-back for the past six years, it creates a lottery as to who comes in at full-back. Gema Simon, utility Amy Harrison, or even youngster Karly Roestbakken could all be in the frame. Milicic hinted at changes to personnel to best counter Brazil\u2019s attacking threats, which almost certainly points to a return of Elise Kellond-Knight into the Matildas\u2019 engine room. With Brazil\u2019s coach Vad\u00e3o employing a 4-4-2 there are pockets of space to exploit in front of the defence \u2013 an area Milicic has experimented with, with Caitlin Foord fulfilling the role of playmaker. \u201cI feel with Kellond-Knight coming back into the squad that\u2019s very important for us because she\u2019s a real natural No 6 and a lot of the good play that we do have, or we\u2019ve had in the past anyway, goes through her.\u201d Once again Milicic confirmed his commitment to an attacking style of football, even though the attacking personnel of Brazil makes this a high-risk strategy. \u201cWe understand they want to use their individual skills, they like to play when the game is stretched,\u201d Milicic said. \u201cThey are strong in transition \u2026 so what\u2019s important for us against an opposition like them, is that we really keep to our shape and we keep our structure really well and with discipline. We don\u2019t want an end-to-end game, an open game.\u201d As Catley confirmed, with the mooted return of six-times world player of the year, Marta, to bolster the Brazilian attack already including hat-trick star Cristiane who spearheaded the win over Jamaica, Australia\u2019s historical rivals are set to only be more formidable. \u201cI\u2019ve played against Marta a lot, I\u2019ve played with her, so I suppose I know how she plays a little better than I know Cristiane,\u201d Catley said. \u201cBoth are players individually full of flair and skill, they can turn it on at any point, so [it is important] just being switched on at all times during an entire game.\u201d It has been over a decade since the Matildas lost four games in a row. And with the stakes involved Milicic could be forgiven for abandoning his attacking mantra in a game of this importance. But like Caesar, urging his troops on in the face of civil discord, sometimes courage alone can win the day. We\u2019ll know soon enough if this is Australian women\u2019s football\u2019s Rubicon moment.",

      "bodyText": "Five months after the dramatic exit of its former CEO Louise Adler and five board members, Melbourne University Publishing have announced Nathan Hollier will take the reins of the company. His appointment is in keeping with the university\u2019s new strategy for MUP, which is to reorient it as a primarily academic publisher with an advisory board appointed by the university, moving away from the commercial publishing strategy implemented by Adler. Adler and five board members resigned in January in protest over the university\u2019s new strategy. Hollier is the founding director of Monash University Publishing, and is credited with transforming the university\u2019s previously existing modest e-press into a print publisher of academic titles. He has spent nearly a decade in the role. Prior to that he was the editor and later chair of the board of progressive literary magazine, Overland, and an academic in literary studies at Victoria University. He has been heavily involved in the small press and literary industry in Australia throughout his career, co-founding and chairing the Small Press Network, serving on government and book industry advisory groups, working as an editor and writing regularly on the state of publishing in Australia. Hollier told Guardian Australia he hopes to \u201cpublish books that will address the important issues of our society, and will last the test of time as important contributions to our public life\u201d. \u201cI very much hope to publish for a broad audience and fulfil the traditional brief of a university press to publish books of scholarly grounding that reach people beyond the university,\u201d he said. MUP board chair Professor Warren Bebbington said Hollier\u2019s work at Monash \u201caligns well with the future plans for Melbourne University Publishing.\u201d Hollier will begin as CEO of MUP on 1 July.",

The 24-15 vote in the House oversight committee came after Donald Trump asserted executive privilege over documents shedding light on the Trump administration\u2019s push to include a question about US citizenship on the 2020 census, in a move that was met with disbelief by former justice department officials. \u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d tweeted Elie Honig, a former federal prosecutor from the southern district of New York. \u201cExecutive privilege is not some magic wand the President gets to wave to hide anything he wants, anytime he wants.\u201d The assertion of privilege on one side, and the contempt vote on the other, marked the latest in a series of clashes between Trump and Democrats in Congress trying to investigate matters from the former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s findings to Trump\u2019s tax returns. In a separate skirmish on the same battlefield Wednesday, the former White House communications director Hope Hicks agreed to testify to Congress behind closed doors about material relating to Mueller\u2019s investigation. It was unclear why the hearing, scheduled for next week, would not be made public. But the current clash, over a Trump administration effort to add a question about US citizenship to the 2020 census, could have direct consequences for representative government and a growing divide between elected officials in Washington and the citizens they purport to represent. The House committee, chaired by Elijah Cummings, has been trying to learn the motives behind a move by the Trump administration to add a question about US citizenship to the upcoming 2020 census. Two weeks ago, it was revealed that a deceased Republican consultant had studied the citizenship question in Texas and concluded it would be \u201cadvantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic whites\u201d.

The clash over the documents behind the census question echoes an episode from last month, when the House judiciary committee moved to hold Barr in contempt for the justice department\u2019s refusal to turn over documents related to the Mueller report.

Seven of New Zealand\u2019s native k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d have died in recent months after falling victim to the respiratory disease aspergillosis. The latest was on Tuesday, where a 100-day-old chick died at the Auckland Zoo. The nocturnal and flightless parrot ingratiated itself with world after it mated with a zoologist\u2019s head during a BBC documentary.

K\u0101k\u0101p\u014d, whose males can grow to 4.8 pounds (2.2kg), were once found in large numbers all over New Zealand. However, habitat destruction and pest invasion forced the bird to edge of extinction. The discovery of a previously unknown population of k\u0101k\u0101p\u014d in the 1970s led to a resurgence of their numbers. The parrot was then the focus of a conservation effort that saw the bird\u2019s population rise from a low of 51 ageing birds to three times that number.

On Wednesday police used used rubber bullets, batons and teargas against people in Hong Kong protesting against the bill that would tighten Beijing\u2019s grip on the semi-autonomous territory. The US president, who is engaged in a major trade war with Beijing, said he hoped the protesters could \u201cwork it out\u201d with Beijing. \u201cI understand the reason for the demonstration, but I\u2019m sure they will be able to work it out.\u201d He did not say how he thought the issue would be resolved. Speaking at the White House, Trump said the demonstrations were massive. \u201cThat was a million people. That was as big a demonstration as I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I hope it all works out for China and for Hong Kong,\u201d Trump added. \u201cI understand the reason for the demonstration but I\u2019m sure they will be able to work it out. I hope they\u2019re going to be able to work it out with China.\u201d The European Union said rights \u201cneed to be respected\u201d in Hong Kong. \u201cOver the past days, the people of Hong Kong have exercised their fundamental right to assemble and express themselves freely and peacefully. These rights need to be respected,\u201d the EU\u2019s external affairs ministry statement said. \u201cRestraint should be exercised by all sides; violence and escalatory responses must be avoided,\u201d it added. The outgoing British prime minister, Theresa May, called for the rights and freedoms set out in the 1984 Sino-British agreement on Hong Kong\u2019s future to be respected. \u201cIt is vital that those extradition arrangements in Hong Kong are in line with the rights and freedoms that were set down in the Sino-British joint declaration,\u201d May told parliament in London.

      "bodyText": "President Trump, aka captain of Team \u201cNO COLLUSION\u201d, tells George Stephanopoulos in an interview that he\u2019d actually be OK with some light collusion, and accept information from foreign governments on his political opponents. As expected, the reaction to his comments was harsh and full of calls for impeachment. Hope Hicks, former communications director for the Trump Administration, will testify behind closed doors before the House judiciary committee next week. The transcript will be made public, according to committee chair Jerry Nadler. The response to the George Stephanopoulos interview, in which President Trump admitted that he would accept information on a political opponent from a foreign government, has been swift: Here\u2019s a clip from the interview with George Stephanopoulos, in which President Trump admitted that he would accept information on a political opponent from a foreign government. Did we really learn nothing from that whole Trump Tower to-do with Russia in 2016? In an interview with ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos, the president admitted that he would accept information on a political opponent from a foreign government. \u201cIt\u2019s not an interference, they have information - I think I\u2019d take it,\u201d President Trump said. \u201cIf I thought there was something wrong, I\u2019d go maybe to the FBI - if I thought there was something wrong. But when somebody comes up with oppo research, right, they come up with oppo research, \u2018oh let\u2019s call the FBI\u2019. The FBI doesn\u2019t have enough agents to take care of it. When you go and talk, honestly, to congressman, they all do it, they always have, and that\u2019s the way it is. It\u2019s called oppo research.\u201d Stephanopoulos asked about Donald Trump Jr and the regrettable role he played in the Trump Tower meeting in June 2016. He asked if Trump\u2019s son should have brought the Russians\u2019 offer for \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton to the FBI. \u201cSomebody comes up and says, \u2018hey, I have information on your opponent\u2019, do you call the FBI?\u201d Trump responded. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, I\u2019ve seen a lot of things over my life. I don\u2019t think in my whole life I\u2019ve ever called the FBI. In my whole life. You don\u2019t call the FBI. You throw somebody out of your office, you do whatever you do,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cOh, give me a break \u2013 life doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d \u201cThe FBI director said that is what should happen,\u201d Stephanopoulos replied. (During congressional testimony last month, FBI director Christopher Wray told lawmakers \u201cthe FBI would want to know about\u201d any foreign election meddling). \u201cThe FBI director is wrong, because frankly it doesn\u2019t happen like that in life,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNow maybe it will start happening, maybe today you\u2019d think differently.\u201d The full interview is set to air on ABC next week. The New York Times is reporting that the Justice Department investigation into the Russian inquiry may go beyond attorney general William Barr\u2019s original question of why the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign. In planning to interview senior CIA officers, the Justice Department is indicating that they \u201care focused partly on the intelligence agencies\u2019 most explosive conclusion about the 2016 election: that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia intervened to benefit Donald J. Trump.\u201d The interview plans are the latest sign the Justice Department will take a critical look at the C.I.A.\u2019s work on Russia\u2019s election interference. Investigators want to talk with at least one senior counterintelligence official and a senior C.I.A. analyst, the people said. Both officials were involved in the agency\u2019s work on understanding the Russian campaign to sabotage the election in 2016. While the Justice Department review is not a criminal inquiry, it has provoked anxiety in the ranks of the C.I.A., according to former officials. Senior agency officials have questioned why the C.I.A.\u2019s analytical work should be subjected to a federal prosecutor\u2019s scrutiny. Attorney General William P. Barr, who is overseeing the review, assigned the United States attorney in Connecticut, John H. Durham, to conduct it. The Justice Department has not submitted formal written requests to talk to the C.I.A. officers, but law enforcement officials have told intelligence officials that Mr. Durham will seek the interviews, two of the people said. Communications officers for both the C.I.A. and the Justice Department declined to comment. The C.I.A. director, Gina Haspel, has told senior officials that her agency will cooperate \u2014 but will still work to protect critical pieces of intelligence whose disclosure could jeopardize sources, reveal collection methods or disclose information provided by allies, according to current and former American officials. Ms. Haspel will not block the interviews and has told the agency that talking with Mr. Durham need not jeopardize secrets and is consistent with cooperating with Mr. Barr\u2019s inquiry. Florida governor Ron DeSantis issued a proclamation ordering state flags be lowered to half-staff and asking Floridians to pause to remember the victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, where 49 people were killed in 2016. The problem? He made no mention of the gay community that was targeted that night three years ago, something that Democratic state Representative Anna Eskamani called him out on via Twitter. The Associated Press is reporting that when the governor was asked about the omission at a bill signing in Jacksonville, he claimed he wasn\u2019t involved in drafting the original proclamation. \u201cWhen someone said that this wasn\u2019t in there, I said, \u2018Well, then put it in there.\u2019 So we fixed it,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, we flew the flags at half staff and that was the reason we put out the proclamation. Sometimes these things happen and you\u2019ve just got to correct it.\u201d It appears that in addition to correcting the original proclamation, DeSantis has since made his planned visit to Pulse on the anniversary. At a roundtable discussion on stopping opioid abuse and reducing drug trafficking, acting homeland secretary Kevin McAleenan told the president that the wall along the southern border is getting built at a rate of about two miles a week. From the pool report: \u201cHow is the wall coming along?\u201d President Trump asked in relation to drug trafficking. \u201cIt is coming along aggressively,\u201d McAleenan responded. \u201cWe built two miles last week; we are up to about two miles per week right now so extending that capability across key sectors.\u201d \u201cAnd you will have, by the end of next year, how much?\u201d Trump asked. \u201cBy the end of next year, it will be over 400 miles,\u201d McAleenan answered. \u201cOver 400 miles, and we have to kick and scream for every inch because the Democrats will just not give us what we need,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIn fact, I think we will be very close to 500 miles by the end of the year, which would be great. It will have a huge impact.\u201d Representative Justin Amash, the first Republican to call for the impeachment of President Trump, has broken from the party line once again in voting to hold attorney general William Barr and commerce secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt for failing to comply with subpoenas related to the 2020 census. This comes a day after Amash voted against the resolution authorizing House judiciary committee chair Jerry Nadler to go to court to enforce congressional subpoenas. Here\u2019s a statement from House judiciary committee chair Jerry Nadler on Hope Hicks agreeing to testify before the committee next week: The Washington Post is reporting that Hope Hicks, a former aid to President Trump, will testify before the House judiciary committee next Wednesday. Though the testimony will take place behind closed doors, the transcript will be released to the public, according to the Post\u2019s sources: Hicks will be the first former Trump aide to go before the committee investigating whether Trump tried to obstruct a probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. But Hicks might not answer many of the panel\u2019s questions, citing the president\u2019s assertion of executive privilege on events that occurred inside the White House. Earlier this month, the White House instructed Hicks not to cooperate with a congressional subpoena for documents related to her White House service. Robert Trout, a lawyer for Hicks, declined to comment. The committee subpoenaed Hicks, the former communications director, last month as part of its obstruction of justice investigation related to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report. The president has been fighting the committee\u2019s attempts to bring forth witnesses, and this interview marks a significant triumph for House Democrats. Hello everybody, Vivian Ho taking over for Oliver Laughland. Hope you\u2019re all having a superb Wednesday. Democrats in the House Oversight Committee have just voted to hold US attorney general William Barr and Treasury Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt of congress. The vote relates to the refusal to hand over documents related to the decision to include a citizenship question in the 2020 census. Donald Trump continued to obfuscate over a letter he received from North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un and denied he was against US intelligence services activities in the region. Donald Trump Jr briefly appeared at a closed door senate intelligence hearing and said he is not worried about any potential perjury allegations. Bernie Sanders delivered an impassioned speech at George Washington University in defence of his political ideology. I\u2019m handing over to my colleague Vivian Ho in San Francisco now. House Democrats have voted in the Oversight Committee to hold the US attorney general, William Barr, and the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, in contempt of congress over their failure to supply documents relating to the citizenship question in the 2020 census. The vote had been delayed from earlier this morning after President Trump exerted executive privilege over the requested documents. The committee\u2019s vote will now go to the full house and represents a significant escalation in the ongoing battle over next year\u2019s census. The Associated Press continues: Democrats fear the citizenship question will reduce census participation in immigrant-heavy communities and result in a severe undercount of minority voters. They say they want specific documents to determine why Ross added the question to the 2020 census and contend the administration has declined to provide the documents despite repeated requests. The administration has turned over more than 17,000 of pages of documents and Ross testified for nearly seven hours in March. The Justice Department said two senior officials were interviewed by committee staff and said officials were working to produce tens of thousands of additional pages of relevant documents. The oversight panel\u2019s chairman, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, disputed the Justice Department\u2019s account and said most of the documents turned over to the committee had already been made public. \u201cWe must protect the integrity of the census and we must stand up for Congress\u2019 authority under the Constitution to conduct meaningful oversight,\u201d Cummings said Wednesday. Sticking with the 2020 race, we have a report that former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz is taking time off from exploring a presidential run. Hallie Golden has a quick story for us: Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz will be taking the summer off from exploring his potential 2020 bid for the US presidency. In a statement released Wednesday, Schultz said he experienced \u201cacute back pain\u201d while he was traveling in Arizona as part of his campaign work, and ultimately had to undergo three back surgeries. He said he has decided to spend the summer focused on rest and rehabilitation. \u201cI take this detour from the road reluctantly,\u201d Schultz said. \u201cMy concern for our country\u2019s future remains, as does my belief that the American people deserve so much more from our elected officials.\u201d In January, the billionaire announced he would explore a potential run for the presidency as an independent candidate. The news sparked a backlash from leading Democrats worried such a move could help President Donald Trump win his reelection bid in 2020. Schultz has spent months traveling to 15 states, talking with thousands of local residents as part of his campaign. In January, he visited his home town of Seattle to promote his new book and was greeted by dozens of protestors. He said he will be back in touch after Labor Day. We\u2019ll return to the Democratic 2020 campaign for a short while and to my colleague Adam Gabbatt who spent the morning with Texas Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke here in New York. O\u2019Rourke, whose campaign has dropped off in recent weeks according to some polls was here to take part in a morning run with LGBTQ activists. Here\u2019s Adam\u2019s report: O\u2019Rourke turned up right on time, ready for action. The 47-year-old was decked out in full running garb for the two-mile jog, mid-thigh shorts displaying willowy legs. He was wearing an Iowa Cubs baseball hat, which seemed on message given the importance of the Hawkeye State in the Democratic primaries. \u201cEverybody ready to run?\u201d O\u2019Rourke asked the roughly 30 people who had assembled on a popular running path close to the Hudson River. There was a muted response. \u201cTwo miles is all we\u2019re doing,\u201d he added, which served to lift spirits a little. With that, O\u2019Rourke bolted off down the pathway, surrounded by people who appeared to have varied levels of commitment to running. Most were wearing the customary shorts, T-shirts and trainers, but one man had opted for the less orthodox white denim jeans, while another wore cut-offs. Federal prosecutors have revealed that they are developing a national security case against the Chinese woman arrested at Donald Trump\u2019s private member\u2019s club in south Florida and charged with unlawful entry. Yujing Zhang, the 33-year-old, was caught attempting to enter Mar-a-Lago with a thumb drive infected with malware in April this year. The Miami Herald reports that prosecutors have requested that certain evidence in the case is held under seal as it includes classified information, an indication that Zhang could face far more serious charges than the ones already laid out. Their full report is here. Away from today\u2019s activities at the White House, Democratic candidate for president Bernie Sanders has been addressing the George Washington University in DC. His speech has been billed as a major defence of his political philosophy. My colleague, Lauren Gambino was there and will be filing a story shortly. Here are a few of her observations on Twitter: You can also read Lauren\u2019s excellent piece from yesterday that includes exerts from Sanders\u2019s expected speech. She assures me he stuck to the script. Trump is asked another question about his recent letter from Kim Jong-un and an intimation made yesterday that he does not support US intelligence agencies operations in the secretive east Asian state. Trump dodges the question again and states: \u201cThere\u2019s been no nuclear testing whatsoever [in North Korea].\u201d He reiterates that he received a \u201cnice letter\u201d from Kim and adds: \u201cRight now we have a very good relationship. Maybe better than its been for 25 years. Maybe forever.\u201d Duda is asked about Poland\u2019s relationship with Russia, specifically whether he views Russian president Vladimir Putin as an ally. Trump interjects before Duda answers calling the question a \u201cset up question\u201d. Duda gives a straight answer: \u201cI would very much like Russia to be a friend of Poland. It is our great neighbour.\u201d The pair take a couple more questions on procedural issues relating to immigration ties between the two countries and then the press conference is over. The two heads of states are now taking a few questions from reporters. Trump is asked whether transferring around 2000 troops to a base in Poland is a snub to the state of Germany over its decision to proceed with the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project with Russia. Trump denies that\u2019s the case but adds: \u201cI will tell you very strongly that I think Germany is making tremendous mistake by relying on the pipeline.\u201d He adds: \u201cPoland has been a tremendous friend of ours for a long time... Our relationship is just a very strong one.\u201d Trump is then asked about a letter he received yesterday from North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, specifically he is asked whether the White House is planning a third summit with North Korea. He does not answer the latter, but describes the letter as a \u201cVery nice letter. Unexpected.\u201d He adds: \u201cSome day you\u2019ll hear about what as in that letter.\u201d We\u2019re back at the White House now as Donald Trump and Polish president Andrzej Duda hold a joint press conference in the Rose Garden. The press conference was preceded by fly over from a F35 fighter jet, of which the Polish state has just purchased a significant number of. The press conference is viewable here. We\u2019ll bring you highlights: Here\u2019s how things stand at lunchtime today: Donald Trump exerted executive privilege over a suite of documents relating to the 2020 US census. The move led house democrats to postpone a contempt vote against Attorney General William Barr and Treasury Secretary Wilbur Ross. Trump met with Polish president Andrzej Duda and announced he was considering moving an additional 2000 US troops to Poland. Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, made a brief appearance at a closed door Senate Intelligence hearing. He told reporters afterwards he has no fear of a perjury investigation following his appearance. Trump is scheduled for another appearance with his Polish counterpart later today at the White House Rose Garden. There were a few lines to digest from that impromptu presser. But sticking with today\u2019s main news on the 2020 census, Trump responded to a question on his decision to exert executive privilege on Justice Department documents relating to the decision to add a citizenship question. Trump conceded he was not completely across the issue as it is a \u201clegal matter\u201d but added: \u201cI think when you have a census and you\u2019re not allowed to talk about when someone is a citizens or not, that doesn\u2019t sound very good to me.\u201d He continued: \u201cI think it\u2019s totally ridiculous that we would have a census that wouldn\u2019t ask it...I think you have the right to ask.\u201d It\u2019s worth reminding readers here again that the census is not a citizenship test but a measure of the US population. It is a central part of American democracy that plays a pivotal role in determining representation in the US congress. Trump also confirmed he would meet with Vladimir Putin at the upcoming G20 summit in Osaka. He joked that he may allow reporters into the room this time. President Trump and his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda, have just taken questions from reporters at the White House. We\u2019ll wait for the full remarks to materialize by the Associated Press reports the top line that Trump says he is considering moving an extra 2,000 troops into Poland from elsewhere in Europe. The report continues: Trump is cautioning during an Oval Office meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda that the decision isn\u2019t final. US officials had said Trump was expected to announce that he was sending about 1,000 additional troops and a squadron of Reaper drones to Poland to aid its self-defense amid concerns about Russian military activity. Polish leaders have been lobbying for additional forces for months and had hoped for a permanent U.S. base they said could be called \u201cFort Trump.\u201d The leaders are scheduled to participate in a \u201cjoint signing ceremony\u201d Wednesday before they go to the Rose Garden for a news conference. It appears the closed door Senate Intelligence committee hearing with the president\u2019s son has finished. Trump Jr briefly appeared in front of reporters at Capitol Hill. He had been compelled to appear before the committee following publication of the Mueller report, which raised questions about his 2017 testimony to the same committee during which he testified about the now infamous meeting between members of the Trump campaign and a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower during the 2016 presidential race. Trump Jr told reporters: \u201cI don\u2019t think I changed anything I said [in prior testimony] because there was nothing to change.\u201d Responding to a question that asked whether he feared perjury allegations, he responded: \u201cNot at all.\u201d Counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway has just been speaking to reporters at the White House. Here are few highlights via the White House pool report: Conway was asked for comment on the pending supreme court decision on the 2020 census. She said: \u201cI think what\u2019s happening is that people who are worried...that it\u2019s constitutional, in fact, to ask a citizenship question on the US Census, are trying to pregame it and get ahead of that by colluding the coverage and that\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d Conway took a dig at former Vice President Joe Biden, the leading candidate in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. She referred to the primary contest as \u201cthat hot mess\u201d and added it was: \u201cobsessive, weird, and downright goofy that Vice President Biden doesn\u2019t mention President Obama but a few times in his speech, and he mentions President Trump 76 times.\u201d On the street protests in Hong Kong, Conway said: \u201cobviously we want people to live in peace and prosperity. It was pretty remarkable to see that many people take to the street.\u201d She added it was possible that Trump will address Beijing\u2019s extradition policy with Chinese President Xi when they next meet. Donald Trump Jr arrived at Capitol Hill a short while earlier for his closed-door hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee. He was asked by reporters if he had come to correct his 2017 testimony and responded there was \u201cnothing to correct\u201d. As we mentioned earlier in the blog, Trump Jr has been compelled to appear before senators after resisting invitations for months. The senators want to discuss answers Trump Jr gave the panel\u2019s staff in a 2017 interview, as well as answers he gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee in a separate interview behind closed doors that year. Trump\u2019s former lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, told a House committee in February that he had briefed Trump Jr approximately 10 times about a plan to build a Trump Tower in Moscow before the presidential election. But Trump Jr told the judiciary panel he was only \u201cperipherally aware\u201d of the real estate proposal. For readers who may not have followed the ongoing political battle over these census documents, here\u2019s a bit of important background. Although these subpoenas may yet shed more important light on the decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, the real battle over how next year\u2019s census will take shape is actually happening at the supreme court. Three lower court decisions have found the decision to add the question was unlawful, leading the Trump administration has taken the fight to the supreme court. Arguments in the case were heard in April and the court, now controlled by a conservative majority, is set to hand down a decision by the end of this month. The decision in that case is likely to be the most significant ruling in this court\u2019s term. The president\u2019s last minute intervention in the wrangle over documents related to the 2020 census has led Democrats to postpone their contempt vote until later today. The Trump administration has asserted executive privilege on documents related to the 2020 census. The move was announced just as the House Oversight Committee is about to vote on a motion that would hold the attorney general, William Barr, and the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, in contempt of congress for failure to disclose the documents. The documents relate to a decision made by Ross and the Justice Department to insert a citizenship question in the 2020 census, which the census bureau itself acknowledges will reduce participation in the census next year. The census is a pivotal tenet in American democracy. It dictates the makeup of congressional boundaries. Numerous studies have indicated that including a citizenship question will reduce participation among certain minority communities, which could ultimately benefit Republicans in future elections. The president has sent his first flurry morning tweets and appears to be particularly irked by a resurfaced report relating to internal polling taken by his re-election campaign. Last month Politico reported that internal polling suggested Trump\u2019s support was slipping in three key battleground states in the midwest amid rising interest in Joe Biden\u2019s run for the Democratic presidential nomination. The New York Times reported on Monday that, following the leak to Politico, Trump instructed aides to lie about the polls findings. Now, it seems, Trump is suggesting that the polls never existed in the first place: As the day grinds into gear, here\u2019s a little more background on Trump Jr\u2019s expected closed door testimony. His expected appearance comes after months of wrangling between Republicans and Democrats in the senate. The president\u2019s son had refused to return to the senate, after his appearance in December 2017 but has now been subpoenaed by the Republican controlled committee. His testimony is expected to be limited in time and scope. CNN first broke the news yesterday and has more background on what Trump is expected to be asked about: The committee is interested in hearing again from Trump Jr. because of discrepancies between his testimony in 2017 and what other witnesses have told both the committee and the special counsel\u2019s office. Trump Jr. appeared before the Senate Intelligence, Senate Judiciary and House Intelligence Committees in 2017, and the release of the Mueller report prompted a new round questions about what Trump Jr. told the Senate Judiciary panel, which released a transcript of his interview. Trump Jr. testified he only told Kushner and campaign chairman Paul Manafort ahead of time about the Trump Tower meeting in which a Russian attorney promised dirt on Hillary Clinton. But then-campaign deputy Rick Gates, who pleaded guilty in the special counsel probe, told Mueller that Trump Jr. talked about a lead on negative information about the Clinton Foundation at a campaign meeting in the days before the Trump Tower meeting. Trump Jr.\u2019s testimony on the Trump Tower Moscow project has also been scrutinized, in which he said he was \u201cperipherally aware\u201d of the project. But Mueller\u2019s report says Cohen testified he discussed the project on multiple occasions with Trump Jr. and that the discussions were not just \u201cidle chit chat.\u201d Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of US politics today. Here\u2019s a rundown of events we\u2019ll be covering from Washington and elsewhere around the country: \u2013 Donald Trump Jr, the president\u2019s oldest son, is expected to testify in a closed door hearing before the Senate intelligence committee today. The hearing is expected to be limited in time and scope, and marks his second appearance before the committee after his first one in December 2017. \u2013 President Donald Trump is set to meet the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, at the White House early this afternoon. The pair will take questions at a joint press conference later in the day. \u2013 The attorney general, William Barr, and treasury secretary, Wilbur Ross, face a contempt vote in the House oversight committee today, over their refusal to hand over documents relating to the 2020 census. That vote will happen this morning. We\u2019ll bring you the news as it happens",
