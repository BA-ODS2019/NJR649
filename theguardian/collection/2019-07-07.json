The Department for Education is to announce a new category of higher technical qualifications (HTQs) as a quality assurance mark for courses such as digital engineering, to cut through the profusion of certificates, diplomas and foundation degrees on offer for school-leavers. Hinds said England\u2019s workforce lagged behind other OECD and European countries in technical qualifications \u2013 held by only one in 10 adults in England, compared with up to one in four in Germany \u2013 which he blamed on \u201ca mixture of low awareness and complexity in the market\u201d as well as cultural attitudes. \u201cFundamentally, I do think in public policy terms, in parliament, in the media, in general, there is a danger we do talk about technical and vocational education in terms of other people\u2019s children, which is something you don\u2019t get in Germany,\u201d Hinds said.

My eldest is nine, I should mention. I\u2019d be very impressed if she wanted to at this point. But when the time comes, absolutely.\u201d Research by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research earlier this year found that workers with higher vocational qualifications in Stem subjects earned \u00a35,000 more than graduates from most British universities by the age of 30, while in construction, social sciences and business their average earnings were close to those of many graduates. The HTQ status will be given to what are known as level four and five qualifications, which sit between A-levels at level three and bachelor degrees at level six, and are offered by further education colleges, universities and the proposed institutes of technology. There are as many as 4,000 level four and five courses offered in England, but 40% have five or fewer students taking them. The government hopes to have NTQ status established by 2022, in time for the first cohort of school-leavers gaining T-levels, the vocational complement to A-levels that are to be taught from next year. But Hinds said that further development was waiting on the outcome of this year\u2019s spending review, and in particular the government\u2019s response to the report on post-age 18 education in England conduced by Philip Augar. Augar\u2019s review called for a substantial injection of resources into further education and training, coupled with cuts to university income from tuition fees. Mark Dawe, the chief executive of the Association of Employment and Learning Providers, said he was sceptical of the benefits of the qualification revamp without further support. \u201cUntil some action is taken along the lines of the Augar recommendations, many young people are going to be sucked on to university courses that don\u2019t offer them the opportunities they deserve,\u201d Dawe said. \u201cWe can create a whole suite of qualifications and it won\u2019t make a blind bit of difference.

      "body": "<p>The UK government should be prepared to impose sanctions against countries that persecute Christians, a report commissioned by the Foreign Office has recommended.</p> <p>It should also adopt a definition of anti-Christian discrimination and persecution, similar to those applied to Islamophobia and antisemitism, the report says. British diplomats and other Foreign Office staff, both in the UK and abroad, should have mandatory training in religious literacy in order to equip them to understand the scale and significance of the issue.</p> <p>The report, by Philip Mounstephen, the bishop of Truro, was commissioned by the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, to examine the extent and nature of Christian persecution and assess the UK government\u2019s response.</p> <p>Hunt said he would enact all of the recommendations if he became prime minister and said he agreed with the report\u2019s conclusion that Christians were the most persecuted religious group in the world.</p> <p>Hunt said the UK must take a firmer stance on the persecution of Christians around the world. \u201cThe sense of misguided political correctness that has stopped us standing up for Christians overseas must end,\u201d he said. \u201cAt home we all benefit from living in a tolerant, diverse society and we should not be afraid of promoting those values abroad. It is a sad fact that Christians are the most persecuted religious group in modern times. I am determined to show that we are on their side.\u201d </p> <p>An estimated one-third of the world\u2019s population suffers from religious persecution in some form, with 80% of them being Christians, it is claimed.</p> <p>Open Doors, which monitors Christian persecution around the world, has estimated that on average each month 345 Christians are killed for faith-related issues.</p> <p>The report said: \u201cEvidence suggests that acts of violence and other intimidation against Christians are becoming more widespread.\u201d In parts of the Middle East and Africa, the vast scale of the violence and its perpetrators\u2019 declared intent to eradicate the Christian community had led to several declarations that Christians were suffering a genocide, it said.</p> <p>Christianity was concentrated in the global south and was perceived therefore as \u201cprimarily a phenomenon of the global poor\u201d, it said. \u201cDespite the impression those in the west might sometimes have to the contrary, the Christian faith is not primarily an expression of white western privilege.\u201d</p> <p>Christian persecution had \u201cmultiple drivers and as such it deserves special attention. More specifically it is certainly not limited to Islamic majority contexts. So this review is not a stalking horse for the Islamophobic far right, nor does it give the Islamophobic right a stick to beat Islam with.\u201d</p> <p>The report added: \u201cThere is a sense that for a number of reasons we have been blind to this issue \u2013 and those reasons would certainly include post-colonial guilt: a sense that we have interfered uninvited in certain contexts in the past so we should not do so again.\u201d</p> <p>It acknowledged that Christians had also historically persecuted others. \u201cOne thinks with shame of the Crusades, the inquisition and the pogroms. But this is not simply a historical phenomenon. Some of the violence in the Central African Republic has very likely been initiated by Christian militia. And responsibility for the dreadful massacre of 8,373 Bosnians in Srebrenica in July 1995 must be laid squarely at the feet of those who professed Christian faith.\u201d</p> <p>According to the report, the persecution of Christians had become \u201ca bellwether for repression\u201d, since if they \u201care being discriminated against in one context or another, you can be confident other minorities are too.\u201d</p> <p>The bishop criticised the \u201cpaucity of awareness of the challenges facing the Christian community\u201d which revealed a lack of religious literacy among Foreign Office staff.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/07/david-mitchell-why-hunt-is-safer-bet-than-johnson\">Why Jeremy Hunt is the safer bet in this unhappy valley | David Mitchell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt seems to me that we currently face two existential threats to human flourishing and harmonious communities: climate change and the systematic denial of FoRB [freedom of religion or belief]. We are beginning to pay proper attention to the former. It is high time we paid proper attention to the latter,\u201d Mounstephen said in his introduction to the report.</p> <p>Among the report\u2019s recommendations to the Foreign Office were that it should \u201cbe prepared to impose sanctions against perpetrators of FoRB abuses\u201d and \u201cseek a [UN] security council resolution urging all governments in the Middle East and North Africa to protect Christians and other persecuted minorities\u201d.</p> <p>The government should \u201cname the phenomenon of Christian discrimination and persecution, and undertake work to identify its particular character alongside similar definitions for other religions\u201d.</p> <p>Foreign Office staff should also be given \u201ctraining in religious literacy and belief dynamics\u201d.</p> <p>Speaking before Monday\u2019s formal launch of the report, Mounstephen said: \u201cMy hope is that in adopting my recommendations the Foreign Office will be able to bring its considerable experience and expertise to bear in helping some of the planet\u2019s most vulnerable people.\u201d </p> <p>Henrietta Blyth, of Open Doors UK and Ireland, said: \u201cThe UK government must act now. It must focus attention on the countries where persecution is most severe and where the situation is rapidly deteriorating \u2026 This review is a good first step to addressing this. For it to be effective it must deliver real, tangible and lasting change for those suffering persecution.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The UK government should be prepared to impose sanctions against countries that persecute Christians, a report commissioned by the Foreign Office has recommended. It should also adopt a definition of anti-Christian discrimination and persecution, similar to those applied to Islamophobia and antisemitism, the report says. British diplomats and other Foreign Office staff, both in the UK and abroad, should have mandatory training in religious literacy in order to equip them to understand the scale and significance of the issue. The report, by Philip Mounstephen, the bishop of Truro, was commissioned by the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, to examine the extent and nature of Christian persecution and assess the UK government\u2019s response. Hunt said he would enact all of the recommendations if he became prime minister and said he agreed with the report\u2019s conclusion that Christians were the most persecuted religious group in the world. Hunt said the UK must take a firmer stance on the persecution of Christians around the world. \u201cThe sense of misguided political correctness that has stopped us standing up for Christians overseas must end,\u201d he said. \u201cAt home we all benefit from living in a tolerant, diverse society and we should not be afraid of promoting those values abroad. It is a sad fact that Christians are the most persecuted religious group in modern times. I am determined to show that we are on their side.\u201d An estimated one-third of the world\u2019s population suffers from religious persecution in some form, with 80% of them being Christians, it is claimed. Open Doors, which monitors Christian persecution around the world, has estimated that on average each month 345 Christians are killed for faith-related issues. The report said: \u201cEvidence suggests that acts of violence and other intimidation against Christians are becoming more widespread.\u201d In parts of the Middle East and Africa, the vast scale of the violence and its perpetrators\u2019 declared intent to eradicate the Christian community had led to several declarations that Christians were suffering a genocide, it said. Christianity was concentrated in the global south and was perceived therefore as \u201cprimarily a phenomenon of the global poor\u201d, it said. \u201cDespite the impression those in the west might sometimes have to the contrary, the Christian faith is not primarily an expression of white western privilege.\u201d Christian persecution had \u201cmultiple drivers and as such it deserves special attention. More specifically it is certainly not limited to Islamic majority contexts. So this review is not a stalking horse for the Islamophobic far right, nor does it give the Islamophobic right a stick to beat Islam with.\u201d The report added: \u201cThere is a sense that for a number of reasons we have been blind to this issue \u2013 and those reasons would certainly include post-colonial guilt: a sense that we have interfered uninvited in certain contexts in the past so we should not do so again.\u201d It acknowledged that Christians had also historically persecuted others. \u201cOne thinks with shame of the Crusades, the inquisition and the pogroms. But this is not simply a historical phenomenon. Some of the violence in the Central African Republic has very likely been initiated by Christian militia. And responsibility for the dreadful massacre of 8,373 Bosnians in Srebrenica in July 1995 must be laid squarely at the feet of those who professed Christian faith.\u201d According to the report, the persecution of Christians had become \u201ca bellwether for repression\u201d, since if they \u201care being discriminated against in one context or another, you can be confident other minorities are too.\u201d The bishop criticised the \u201cpaucity of awareness of the challenges facing the Christian community\u201d which revealed a lack of religious literacy among Foreign Office staff. \u201cIt seems to me that we currently face two existential threats to human flourishing and harmonious communities: climate change and the systematic denial of FoRB [freedom of religion or belief]. We are beginning to pay proper attention to the former. It is high time we paid proper attention to the latter,\u201d Mounstephen said in his introduction to the report. Among the report\u2019s recommendations to the Foreign Office were that it should \u201cbe prepared to impose sanctions against perpetrators of FoRB abuses\u201d and \u201cseek a [UN] security council resolution urging all governments in the Middle East and North Africa to protect Christians and other persecuted minorities\u201d. The government should \u201cname the phenomenon of Christian discrimination and persecution, and undertake work to identify its particular character alongside similar definitions for other religions\u201d. Foreign Office staff should also be given \u201ctraining in religious literacy and belief dynamics\u201d. Speaking before Monday\u2019s formal launch of the report, Mounstephen said: \u201cMy hope is that in adopting my recommendations the Foreign Office will be able to bring its considerable experience and expertise to bear in helping some of the planet\u2019s most vulnerable people.\u201d Henrietta Blyth, of Open Doors UK and Ireland, said: \u201cThe UK government must act now. It must focus attention on the countries where persecution is most severe and where the situation is rapidly deteriorating \u2026 This review is a good first step to addressing this. For it to be effective it must deliver real, tangible and lasting change for those suffering persecution.\u201d",

Against Kvitova, whom she has lost to three times out of four, she will need to defend well and may just need the help of the crowd. Some players struggle under the pressure of performing in front of home fans but Konta seems to revel in it. \u201cI never looked at it or approached this tournament as a burden, more just another great opportunity for me to do what I love and at home,\u201d she said. \u201cNot everybody gets a home slam, not everybody gets home events. I am part of a very select few who getthat opportunity, so I can only really be grateful for that.\u201d",

(Not blaming VAR, just that the current law is utter nonsense, and almost everything looks like a penalty in slow motion.) Views?\u201d</p> <p>My view is that VAR in its current form is an egregious shambles, and will stay that way until everyone learns the meaning of the phrase \u201cclear and obvious\u201d. I\u2019m not against it in principle \u2013 it works in other sports \u2013 but it needed to be trialled for at least another decade before it was ready.

Brazil may have made a gruesome, historic mess of hosting the World Cup, but the Copa America has provided a much happier story. This is the fifth time they have hosted it; on the first four occasions, in 1919, 1922, 1949 and 1989, they won the tournament.</p> <p>Approximately 100.00 per cent of the Brazilian population will expect them make it five out of five by beating Peru at the Maracana today. It\u2019s hard to envisage any other result. Brazil under Tite have been extremely hard to beat \u2013 even if, as is their <a href=\"https://www.theblizzard.co.uk/article/italy-3-brazil-2\">post-Sarri\u00e0</a> wont, they have generally been more efficient than erotic since he took over. </p> <p>They are yet to concede a goal in this tournament. But two of their five matches ended 0-0 and some of the most joyous moments for Brazilian fans have involved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/06/lionel-messi-controversial-red-card-argentina-chile-match-report\">the woes of Saint Lionel</a> rather than the old <em>jogo bonito.</em></p> <p>Brazil last won this tournament in 2007. Peru last did so in 1975, which was also the last time they reached the final. At their best they are a dynamic, likeable side, as they showed when they thumped the holders Chile 3-0 in the semi-finals. </p> <p>Until then they were mediocre, however, Brazil plugged them 5-0 during the group stage. For that, and many other reasons, a win for Peru would register very high on the <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/feb/18/world-cup-25-stunning-moments-no2-uruguay-brazil-1950-scott-murray\">Maracanozometer</a></em>. </p> <p><strong>Kick off </strong>is at 5pm local time, 4pm ET, 9pm CET.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/06/peru-brazil-copa-america-final-ricardo-gareca-maracana\">Ricardo Gareca bids to join rare group by leading Peru to Copa Am\u00e9rica title | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-07T18:49:34.788Z\">at 7.49pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "For those with a certain lust for life, there are a gazillion worse places to be than Rio de Janeiro tonight. There ain\u2019t no party like a sele\u00e7\u00e3o party, and all of Brazil has plenty to celebrate. Congratulations to them, commiserations to Peru, and thanks for your company and emails. Bye! The Brazil players are jumping round like idiots. Most of us have no idea how good they are feeling right now. Alisson and Firmino embrace - they are champions of Europe with their club, champions of South America with their country. Full time: Brazil 3-1 Peru Peep peep! Brazil are champions of South America for the first time since 2007! It was a deserved victory - not just tonight but throughout the tournament. They may not be a great side, certainly not by Brazilian standards, but they are comfortably the best in South America right now. It was a fine penalty, driven hard and low to his left. It was right in the corner. Brazil deserve to win, despite that slightly surreal period either side of Gabriel Jesus\u2019s red card. Richarlison wins the Copa America for Brazil!!! The penalty stands! The referee has twice told his VAR colleagues where to go tonight. Dear lord. You can argue the penalty decision both ways, but there\u2019s no way it was a clear and obvious error by the referee. Everton played a one-two with Richarlison, charged into the area and was bumped over by Zambrano. It was a needless challenge because Gallese was going to get to the ball first. 87 min Peru have barely crossed the halfway line in the last five minutes. It\u2019s a very strange end to the game - and now Brazil have a penalty for a barge on Everton! 86 min \u201cEder on for Brazil,\u201d notes Simon McMahon. \u201cIt\u2019s 1982 all over again! 4-1 ...\u201d 86 min Another Peru change - Polo on, Carrillo off. 85 min Brazil are killing the game with ease, and Peru are getting increasingly frustrated. 84 min \u201cMadrid has a big Peruvian community, especially in working class areas of the city, so you see quite a lot of Peru shirts at Estadio de Vallecas (or spelt Vallekas if you\u2019re cool),\u201d says Christian. \u201cI\u2019ve just come home from a Peruvian restaurant where they had the game on. Big party atmosphere, packed with people cheering. I\u2019m so old and boring that despite my intentions to join in with it all, I felt tired and left 10 minutes before kick off. I\u2019m at home drinking beer on the sofa as usual now.\u201d 83 min Peru, despite having the extra man, are struggling to put Brazil under sustained pressure. Advincula is booked for a body check on Everton. 82 min Advincula tried to hold off Everton, who went down holding his face. There was contact but it wasn\u2019t intentional, and play continues. Peru make another change, with Gonzales replacing Tapia. 81 min Peru move the ball smartly from right to left. Flores drifts over a dangerous cross that is headed away, and now the Brazil players are trying to get someone sent off, Advincula I think. 79 min Peru make their first change, with Raul Ruidiaz replacing Yotun. 78 min \u201cNot sure he deserved the second yellow but he could be in a LOT of trouble for his gesture suggesting the referee is on the take (unless, of course, I was the only one who noticed it),\u201d says David Marriott. \u201cNiggly game though, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Ah yes, I noticed that gesture but didn\u2019t register it. His noggin had completely gone at that point. 77 min Eder Militao replaces Coutinho. Since being reduced to 10 men, Brazil have punted jogo bonito straight over the stands. 75 min Richarlison replaces Roberto Firmino. Gabriel Jesus\u2019s second yellow card was for jumping into Zambrano, who had flattened him moments earlier. It looked a bit harsh to me. A camera shows Jesus sitting on a step inside the stadium, crying his eyes out. 74 min What an effort from Flores! A defensive clearance came to him 25 yards from goal, and after controlling the ball he swished a beautiful half-volley just wide of goal. I\u2019m not sure Alisson would have got there. 73 min A half chance for Peru! Trauco\u2019s stinging shot from a tight angle is shovelled round the post by Alisson. Out of nothing, Peru have an incredible chance to achieve immortality. 71 min I\u2019m not even sure what that was for. Jesus was fuming, and took an age to leave the field. 70 min Oh my goodness. Gabriel Jesus has been given a second yellow card, and Brazil are down to 10 men! 68 min Zambrano is booked for flattening Gabriel Jesus. 67 min Carrillo\u2019s cross is put behind for a corner. This is Peru\u2019s best spell of the whole game. 66 min An excellent inswinging free-kick from Yotun is superbly headed away by Thiago Silva. That was a fine, commanding bit of defending. 65 min Alisson puts Brazil under a bit of pressure with a poor pass towards Alex Sandro that Carrillo ushers out of play for a throw-in. Peru need to stay in the game for as long as possible in the hope that Brazil will get the jitters. 62 min A stylish, penetrative run from Cueva, who beats two players on the edge of the area before stabbing a pass towards Guerrero. It\u2019s hoofed away by Thiago Silva (I think). 61 min \u201cI may be ill,\u201d says Niall Mullen, \u201cbut I definitely prefer the 1986 West Germany kit.\u201d I\u2019m a big fan of an off-kilter logo, but it\u2019s not enough to elevate it above 1990, for mine. 60 min \u201cGiven the feistiness and energy of this Brazil unit, do you think Neymar would actually improve it?\u201d says JP. \u201cI feel that there is definitely a calculation to be made, balancing ability against temperament and team-mindedness.\u201d Surely, in modern football, the question is: will Tite improve Neymar\u2019s side? 59 min Coutinho\u2019s stinging shot from inside the D is blocked. He looks desperate to score. 57 min It feels like a third Brazilian goal is in the post. Everton plays the ball back to Alex Sandro, whose fast, first-time cross is headed wide at the near post by the stooping Firmino. 56 min \u201cI\u2019ve always loved Peru, and their kit,\u201d says Phil Grey. \u201cAs a kid I\u2019d wear a white T shirt and borrow my mother\u2019s red belt and wear it diagonally over one shoulder and pretend to be Cubillas. Do you know if he\u2019s there tonight, at the Maracana?\u201d I\u2019ve no idea, but I hope so. And I hope you\u2019re wearing a red belt over one shoulder in tribute. 54 min: A double chance for Brazil! First Coutinho went a glorious solo run, only to shoot from the edge of the area when he should have played in Gabriel Jesus. His shot was blocked and the ball rebounded to Jesus, who eased it forward to give Firmino what looked a simple chance. Instead he dragged a tame shot well wide of the far post. 54 min \u201cHello Rob,\u201d says Avitaj Mitra. \u201cI don\u2019t see VAR surviving for more than a couple of years, unless changes are made to the handball law. (Not blaming VAR, just that the current law is utter nonsense, and almost everything looks like a penalty in slow motion.) Views?\u201d My view is that VAR in its current form is an egregious shambles, and will stay that way until everyone learns the meaning of the phrase \u201cclear and obvious\u201d. I\u2019m not against it in principle \u2013 it works in other sports \u2013 but it needed to be trialled for at least another decade before it was ready. I think it\u2019s here to stay, though; nobody will have the courage to put it back in its box, where it belongs. But that\u2019s just my opinion. 53 min Thiago Silva is booked for a hack at Cueva. 51 min A lovely effort from Coutinho, whose rising drive across goal flashes this far past the top corner. 49 min Tapia takes a yellow card for the team, dragging Coutinho down to stop a Brazil counter-attack. 48 min Some early pressure from Brazil. A corner is taken short to Alex Sandro, whose cross is headed away. Dani Alves picks up the loose ball and tries to score from 40 yards. No. 47 min \u201cSpeaking once again as a Liverpool dan, it\u2019s great to be able to enjoy Gabriel Jesus\u2019 skill (and any Alison brinkmanship) without consternation,\u201d says JP. \u201cHelluva player.\u201d 46 min Peep peep! Brazil begin the second half. Half-time reading Half-time chit chat \u201cExcept Scotland aren\u2019t Brazil, are they?\u201d says Simon McMahon. Peep peep! Brazil deserve to lead at half-time, but their second goal was a cruel blow to Peru so soon after their equaliser. Paolo Guerrero is almost in tears as he walks off the field. The goal stemmed from the defensive industry of Firmino, who nicked the ball off a Peruvian player near the halfway line. His tackle diverted the ball to Arthur, who skedaddled into space and played a short through pass to Gabriel Jesus just inside the area. Zambrano slipped, which gave Jesus just enough time to drag a disguised low shot across Gallese and into the far corner. Lovely finish. Brazil are back in front! 45+1 min \u201cPeru equalised just on half-time,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cIt\u2019s 1978 all over again. Let\u2019s all watch Grease together!!\u201d 45 min That goal wasn\u2019t against the run of play; it was affront to the run of play. Peru, quite rightly, will not give a solitary fig about that. They are level in the Copa America final! Guerrero scores! He passes the ball calmly to his right, sending Alisson the wrong way. And rightly so. The VAR check was absurd and unnecessary. Well, this is ludicrous. It was given for handball against Thiago Silva, who fell as he tried to tackle Cueva. The ball hit his hand, and under the revised law that\u2019s a penalty. 41 min Well that has changed things. 39 min A better move from Peru ends when Guerrero goes over in the Brazil area. There were no appeals for a penalty from the Peru players. 36 min: Good chance for Firmino! After another classy passing move, Alex Sandro curled a booming cross beyond the far post, where Firmino got above Trauco and thumped a header over the bar. Trauco just about did enough to ensure Firmino could not get over the top of the ball. 36 min \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound inflammatory, but Niall Mullen is an ill man if he genuinely doesn\u2019t see the beauty in West Germany\u2019s 1990 kit,\u201d inflames Matt Dony. \u201cI don\u2019t have fond memories of that team, but that kit still looks wonderful. Admittedly, it\u2019s no \u2018Crown Paints\u2019, but pretty darn spiffing nonetheless.\u201d 35 min Everton goes on a thrilling run down the left, beating Avincula twice before Zambrano comes across to clear. 34 min Peru are a game bunch, but so far Brazil have had a bit too much nous. They have kept the Peru attack at arm\u2019s length throughout the match. 33 min \u201cUpdate from Naxos,\u201d says JP. \u201cA kid at the restaurant has drawn the ire of the bartender by overriding the TV with his phone and casting YouTube kids onto the big screen. The interesting thing is that Dejan Lovren appears to have a sideline as a singing Mexican in a sombrero on kids TV. Explains a lot...\u201d Wait till you see the Alberto Moreno channel. 30 min Gabriel Jesus is booked for a foul on Yotun. 30 min \u201cHow Liverpool dans achieve that grade?\u201d asks Niall Mullen. \u201cThey judo don\u2019t they though.\u201d 29 min Brazil break through Gabriel Jesus, who is fouled just past the halfway line by Tapia. He knew what he was doing, but did it with sufficient clumsiness to avoid a yellow card. 27 min The Peru coach Ricardo Gareca is very animated on the touchline, waving his hands all over the place like David Brent. Peru win a corner, their first I think. Yotun\u2019s outswinger from the left is headed over from six yards by the under-pressure Zambrano (I think). It wasn\u2019t much of a chance. 25 min \u201cEvening Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cGot to agree about the Peru kit being a timeless classic. But as for not capturing the public imagination, they certainly grabbed the attention of lots of Scotland fans in 1978.\u201d 24 min That was almost a second. After a long, patient move, Firmino cut the ball back from the left to Coutinho, whose stabbed shot with the outside of his right foot drifted a few yards wide. Gallese had it covered. 23 min It\u2019s been all Brazil since the goal. 20 min Now Brazil are pressing high up the pitch, and Peru have struggled to get out in the last few minutes. 18 min Brazil have not conceded in the entire tournament, so it\u2019s fair to say Peru are up against it. It was a really nice goal. Dani Alves drove a long pass down the right to Gabriel Jesus, who turned Trauco inside out and drove a cross towards the far post. It picked out the unmarked Everton, who arrived late and slammed a volley into the net from eight yards. And Brazil have got the opening goal! 14 min Brazil have started to settle, with Arthur and Casemiro seeing more of the ball in midfield. The first goal already feels vital, such is the edginess around the ground. 12 min Alex Sandro is sent flying by Yotun, who is chastised by the referee. 11 min \u201cThese two teams,\u201d begins Scott Bassett, \u201care going to kick the bejesus out of each other, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Well, it\u2019s an option. 10 min Peru have been the better team in the first 10 minutes, playing with more aggression and purpose. It makes sense to start fast and try to undermine Brazil before they settle into the game. 9 min \u201cAs a Liverpool dan,\u201d says JP, \u201cit\u2019s great to see two current player and one ex-player in the Brazil XI as well as Everton to round things out.\u201d A Liverpool dan? How do you achieve that rank, then? 6 min Peru are starting to settle into the game and are pressing Brazil high up the pitch. A clearance goes straight to Yotun, who chests it down and hits a looping shot from distance that goes well wide. 6 min \u201cI hope Peru can make it a game but I doubt it,\u201d says Mary Waltz. \u201cBrazil at home with a huge edge in quality will be too much.\u201d I agree, although I said the same before the 1950 World Cup decider against Uruguay. 5 min It\u2019s been a bitty, slightly nervous start from both sides. 2 min Coutinho is penalised for handball 35 yards from goal. Cueva steeps up, to huge jeers, and curls a few yards wide. Alisson had it covered. 2 min \u201cPeru have always had the most underrated jersey in world football,\u201d says Niall Mullen. \u201cMaybe because they have never captured the public\u2019s imagination like Denmark 86. Most overrated, since you didn\u2019t, West Germany 1990.\u201d I agree about Peru\u2019s shirt, which is a timeless classic. That said, I wonder if it falls foul of the Irwin/Parlour rule, which says you can\u2019t be underrated if everyone says you\u2019re underrated. Brazil\u2019s current kit is also lovely. 1 min Peep peep! Peru get the match under way. They are wearing white with the familiar red sash. Brazil are in yellow and green. \u201cSitting alone in a restaurant in Naxos,\u201d says JP. \u201cThe bartender is 99.99% confident that the game is rigged in the hosts\u2019 favour. Is that indeed so?\u201d Yes: Brazil have a population of 212 million to Peru\u2019s 33m. The Peru players are belting out the national anthem. Some of them look close to tears. Brazil\u2019s players are a little less emotional, with the inevitable, wonderful exception of Dani Alves. This is Brazil\u2019s first game at the Maracana since Fred routed Brazil in the final of the 2013 Confederations Cup. Alternative live action Brazil (4-3-3) Alisson; Alves, Marquinhos, Thiago Silva, Sandro; Arthur, Casemiro, Coutinho; Jesus, Firmino, Everton. Substitutes: Miranda, Filipe Luis, David Neves, Willian, Eder Militao, Allan, Cassio Ramos, Fernandinho, Lucas Paqueta, Richarlison, Fagner, Ederson. Peru (4-2-3-1) Gallese; Advincula, Zambrano, Abram, Trauco; Tapia, Yotun; Carrillo, Cueva, Flores; Guerrero. Substitutes: Corzo, Santamaria, Araujo, Ballon, Ruidiaz, Caceda, Polo, Pretell, Alvarez, Callens, Gonzales. Referee Roberto Tobar. Hello. Brazil may have made a gruesome, historic mess of hosting the World Cup, but the Copa America has provided a much happier story. This is the fifth time they have hosted it; on the first four occasions, in 1919, 1922, 1949 and 1989, they won the tournament. Approximately 100.00 per cent of the Brazilian population will expect them make it five out of five by beating Peru at the Maracana today. It\u2019s hard to envisage any other result. Brazil under Tite have been extremely hard to beat \u2013 even if, as is their post-Sarri\u00e0 wont, they have generally been more efficient than erotic since he took over. They are yet to concede a goal in this tournament. But two of their five matches ended 0-0 and some of the most joyous moments for Brazilian fans have involved the woes of Saint Lionel rather than the old jogo bonito. Brazil last won this tournament in 2007. Peru last did so in 1975, which was also the last time they reached the final. At their best they are a dynamic, likeable side, as they showed when they thumped the holders Chile 3-0 in the semi-finals. Until then they were mediocre, however, Brazil plugged them 5-0 during the group stage. For that, and many other reasons, a win for Peru would register very high on the Maracanozometer. Kick off is at 5pm local time, 4pm ET, 9pm CET.",

Throughout his 14-year professional career he has defied the odds and all expert opinion. He has invariably found a way.</p> <p>None of his serial physical blows seemed to have killed his love of the game, although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/11/tearful-andy-murray-to-retire-after-2019-wimbledon-australian-open\" title=\"\">he came perilously close to walking away</a> after his hip pain kicked in brutally in the first round of the Australian Open in January. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/mar/06/andy-murray-pain-free-after-operation-but-cautious-over-playing-prospects\" title=\"\">One final operation saved his career</a>.</p> <p>It could hardly have been clearer from his demeanour on Centre Court on Saturday evening, when he and Williams laughed and smiled their way through an easy opening match, that he is convinced he made the right decision in carrying on.</p> <p>The next challenge is to break out from the relatively undemanding world of doubles, in the men\u2019s and mixed, to test himself in singles again. That could happen in Cincinnati in September as a dress rehearsal for a full return to the heat of competition at the US Open, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/11/andy-murray-us-open-novak-djokovic1\" title=\"\">where he won his first slam title seven years ago</a>.</p> <p>Much has happened since 2012 across the Tour as the rivals he grew up with have won their own struggles against injury and the ravages of time but Murray insists he can work his way back into that picture. \u201cI know how bad I felt in Australia and how bad I felt the last year that I played singles here, and I feel better now than I did then,\u201d he says.</p> <p>His last singles appearance at Wimbledon, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jul/12/andy-murray-wimbledon-quarter-final-sam-querrey-match-report\" title=\"\">when he hobbled through five sets against Sam Querrey in 2017</a>, mirrored the trauma of the Roberto Bautista Agut match in Melbourne but, as far as Murray is concerned, those experiences have been parked in the past. He has survived them and learned from the consequences.</p> <p>\u201cIf, physically, I can get back to a good level my tennis is still fine,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m sure that, tennis-wise, I will be able to keep up with guys. I don\u2019t feel that the game has moved on and I won\u2019t be able to get back. A lot of the same guys are still there.\u201d</p> <p>It has been starkly illustrated in the first week here that the expected rise of the young contenders in the men\u2019s game is still in its early stages, as, one by one, they have fallen. The sixth seed, Alexander Zverev, went out in the first round along with the seventh, Stefanos Tsitsipas, followed by the Canadian teenager F\u00e9lix Auger-Aliassime in the third round.</p> <p>A slew of prospects and established seeds have failed to reach the second week. From one side of the draw alone Kevin Anderson, last year\u2019s finalist and the fourth seed, has gone, along with the three-slam champion Stan Wawrinka, 10th seed Karen Khachanov, 11th seed Daniil Medvedev, as well as Britain\u2019s Kyle Edmund. Gone also, after a fighting exit on Saturday night, is back-in-form Dan Evans.</p> <p>On the other side of the draw notable casualties include Dominic Thiem, Nick Kyrgios, John Isner, Marin Cilic, Denis Shapovalov and Alex de Minaur.

      "bodyText": "Andy Murray sees no reason he cannot still beat Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, the champions who have been part of his own history, as he continues a comeback that looked out of the question six months ago. He is back where he feels most comfortable in the entire tennis landscape, the second week of Wimbledon \u2013 even if only in mixed doubles \u2013 and it has plainly whetted his appetite to drive on for a while yet at 32. Although his return after an absence of two years is now restricted to playing alongside Serena Williams, Murray believes he can compete again at the highest level in singles, the arena where he won his three grand slam titles, two of them at Wimbledon. \u201cWhy not?\u201d he says, when asked whether he still felt he could beat the best of the past and the best of the future. \u201cIf someone can give me a reason why I shouldn\u2019t be able to compete again then I would listen to it, but so far I haven\u2019t really been given one.\u201d What separates Murray from the herd is his single-mindedness. Throughout his 14-year professional career he has defied the odds and all expert opinion. He has invariably found a way. None of his serial physical blows seemed to have killed his love of the game, although he came perilously close to walking away after his hip pain kicked in brutally in the first round of the Australian Open in January. One final operation saved his career. It could hardly have been clearer from his demeanour on Centre Court on Saturday evening, when he and Williams laughed and smiled their way through an easy opening match, that he is convinced he made the right decision in carrying on. The next challenge is to break out from the relatively undemanding world of doubles, in the men\u2019s and mixed, to test himself in singles again. That could happen in Cincinnati in September as a dress rehearsal for a full return to the heat of competition at the US Open, where he won his first slam title seven years ago. Much has happened since 2012 across the Tour as the rivals he grew up with have won their own struggles against injury and the ravages of time but Murray insists he can work his way back into that picture. \u201cI know how bad I felt in Australia and how bad I felt the last year that I played singles here, and I feel better now than I did then,\u201d he says. His last singles appearance at Wimbledon, when he hobbled through five sets against Sam Querrey in 2017, mirrored the trauma of the Roberto Bautista Agut match in Melbourne but, as far as Murray is concerned, those experiences have been parked in the past. He has survived them and learned from the consequences. \u201cIf, physically, I can get back to a good level my tennis is still fine,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m sure that, tennis-wise, I will be able to keep up with guys. I don\u2019t feel that the game has moved on and I won\u2019t be able to get back. A lot of the same guys are still there.\u201d It has been starkly illustrated in the first week here that the expected rise of the young contenders in the men\u2019s game is still in its early stages, as, one by one, they have fallen. The sixth seed, Alexander Zverev, went out in the first round along with the seventh, Stefanos Tsitsipas, followed by the Canadian teenager F\u00e9lix Auger-Aliassime in the third round. A slew of prospects and established seeds have failed to reach the second week. From one side of the draw alone Kevin Anderson, last year\u2019s finalist and the fourth seed, has gone, along with the three-slam champion Stan Wawrinka, 10th seed Karen Khachanov, 11th seed Daniil Medvedev, as well as Britain\u2019s Kyle Edmund. Gone also, after a fighting exit on Saturday night, is back-in-form Dan Evans. On the other side of the draw notable casualties include Dominic Thiem, Nick Kyrgios, John Isner, Marin Cilic, Denis Shapovalov and Alex de Minaur. Still standing, of course, are Djokovic, Nadal and Federer, along with Kei Nishikori, the only top-10 players left. Murray, meanwhile, is determined to play his one remaining card for as long as he can, having lost in the first round of the men\u2019s doubles earlier on Saturday. But did he not miss the cut and thrust of high-grade singles, though? Yes and no. \u201cIt\u2019s just different, singles and doubles. There is a lot more self-analysis in singles. It\u2019s your responsibility. The thing that is nice with doubles is that, when you win, you are winning with someone else and that is enjoyable. \u201cWhen me and Feli [L\u00f3pez] won at Queen\u2019s, we went out and bonded with each other, had dinner and that sort of stuff. In singles at the end of matches it is on you and that is the thing I\u2019ve always had that is kind of different to doubles really. \u201cAt Queen\u2019s, for example, we won the end of that final because of Feli. He played brilliant at the end of the match. So it is difficult to know how responsible you were for certain things. That\u2019s the thing that is different about it that I am not used to as much.\u201d For all that he is enjoying his mixed doubles experiment with Williams, there is a murmur beneath that strongly suggests he cannot wait to get back to being a champion again \u2013 on his own.",

It has a 67% fatality rate and 11 months after it began, the case numbers are still escalating. It is disproportionately affecting women (55% of cases) and children (28%).</p>\n    <p>The WHO declared the outbreak an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/17/drc-ebola-epidemic-is-international-emergency-says-who\">international public health emergency</a>&nbsp;in July 2019. The same month saw the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/15/ebola-virus-reaches-congolese-city-of-goma\">the first diagnosis of a case in Goma</a>, a city of 2 million people, which is a transport hub on the border with Rwanda. In early August Rwanda&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/aug/01/rwanda-closes-border-with-dr-congo-over-deadly-ebola-outbreak-goma\">announced that it was closing its border with DRC</a>.</p>\n    <p>The WHO has long said that the national and regional risk levels are very high and containment of the spread to North Kivu and Ituri provinces was unlikely, unless a break in the fighting made it safe for health workers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is Ebola and how do you treat it?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ebola\">Ebola</a>&nbsp;hemorrhagic fever is caused by a virus that has a reservoir among forest animals, including monkeys and bats. It is spread through body fluids, which is why carers \u2013 mostly female relatives and nursing staff \u2013 are particularly at risk. It causes fever, aches and diarrhoea and attacks the immune system, causing blood clotting cells to malfunction so that victims bleed extensively and die if their immune system cannot fight off the viral infection.</p>\n    <p>Drugs are still experimental. Patients are isolated and treated by nurses wearing full protective body suits and masks who try to boost their immune response. Friends and relatives are quarantined for 21 days. Prevention measures include washing hands at every opportunity and safe burial practices, with no touching or washing of the body, as is traditional in some cultures.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How does this compare with other outbreaks?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The 2013 and 2016 outbreak in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea spread for months through forest regions in west&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa\">Africa</a>&nbsp;where Ebola was unknown before the emergency was recognised. It escalated when it emerged in towns and cities, with 28,600 cases and 11,300 deaths.</p>\n    <p>DRC successfully stamped out nine previous Ebola outbreaks in rural areas within a matter of a few months.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/aid\">Aid</a>&nbsp;agencies, infectious disease experts and the WHO say it will be very hard to bring this outbreak under control, even though they have had vaccines and experimental drugs from the outset.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the contributing factors to this outbreak?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>There is almost no functioning state in much of eastern DRC. There is an almost total lack of basic services such as power, education, roads, healthcare, and the authority of the government only extends to the edges of urban areas.</p>\n    <p>Police are corrupt, predatory and violent. In rural zones, militia and armed bands provide security and employment opportunities but also steal, rape and kill at will. It is one of the most hostile environments faced by aid and health workers anywhere in the world.</p>\n    <p>Mistrust of officials and foreigners is harming efforts to tackle the disease and conspiracy theories are rampant. Some believe the outbreak is fake news spread by rapacious NGOs and the UN to justify their presence in the country and allow the extraction of valuable mineral resources.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\"><b>Sarah Boseley</b></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jasonburke\"><b>Jason Burke</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He singled out some other European countries with links to the DRC for giving \u201cstrikingly little\u201d, suggesting France, for example, may have provided as little as $1m (\u00a3800,000). The UK and US have provided more than half of the funding for the emergency.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are critically short of money,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThere is going to be a funding gap of $100m, and probably of $300m through to December because we have to stay on top of this. It is a very expensive response because the local systems are simply not there. We cannot move from one area to another and say it is solved. It keeps coming out of the periphery again and jumping 300km north. The money is central.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said the cash was needed to undertake \u201cring vaccination\u201d, a way of immunising two layers of contacts of someone who has contracted the disease. During an outbreak in west Africa in 2014-16, one person affected could transmit the disease to as many as four others. The vaccine strategy in Congo can reduce this ratio to 1:1.3. \u201cThe only reason we don\u2019t have tens of thousands potentially more dead is because of this British-funded vaccine,\u201d Stewart said.</p> \n<p>At the centre of the crisis, in Butembo, Stewart met one recovering Ebola patient, Moise Kambale. His brother had contracted the disease and passed it on to his visiting father, who took it back to Kambale\u2019s family. </p> \n<p>\u201cThese are unspeakable horrors,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThe critical issue is the way villages and towns respond to the crisis. Thirty percent of people at any one time are terrified about even being vaccinated.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe were in a healthcare clinic this morning where they have to build an entire sandbag area so when the armed groups come in and start shooting, the healthcare workers can hide.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is an area where most of the work has to go into convincing the healthcare workers even to wear their protective clothing, to convince villagers to come forward to be vaccinated, as well as to convince armed groups not to kill doctors. We are struggling to keep up with this.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said he was \u201cvery concerned\u201d that the disease could spread to the densely populated city of Goma, 200 miles to the south. \u201cIf it gets into that kind of place, we have a problem. Goma is really connected to the world. It has the Grand Barriere heading into Rwanda. It is absolutely vital that we hold it here in Butembo and Beni.\u201d</p> \n<p>Despite the bravery he saw, Stewart did not shy away from the problems with the emergency response, including a public health system that he said had been destroyed by \u201cdecades of predatory government\u201d.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cIt is very difficult to work with the infrastructure of the Congo health ministry. There are around 300 small health clinics just around here. Forty percent of the infections in November and December were healthcare workers working inside those health clinics and then passing it on.\u201d He said WHO staff admitted it was very difficult to know what happened in these clinics and were constantly seeking messengers to build trust among local people.</p> \n<p>People feel traumatised by the violence that keeps them poor and wonder why the health workers come when so many before have died from disease.</p> \n<p>Dr Ibrahima Soc\u00e9 Fall, a senior WHO official in charge of 32 health areas, said: \u201cWe have all kind of armed groups here, and just criminals.

      "bodyText": "The year-long Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is on the edge of spiralling out of control and the World Health Organization should declare it an international emergency, Rory Stewart, the UK\u2019s international development secretary, has said. Stewart is on a two-day visit to the DRC visiting emergency health centres and victims of the disease to assess the issues hampering efforts to bring the epidemic under permanent control. So far in the outbreak 2,400 people have contracted the disease and 1,606 have died, according to the WHO. Militia groups have attacked health workers, and some community leaders say there is resentment over the mass arrival of UN agencies to combat Ebola in a large remote region where for decades more curable diseases such as cholera or measles have been left untreated.

Well, yes. But. The one thing the plebiscite did was remove the ability for a vocal minority to hijack the political system to inflict their views on the rest.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 8 July. Top stories The nation\u2019s biggest health insurers illegally rejected the claims of thousands of sick or injured Australians over seven years, leaked documents show. A government whistleblower who investigated their conduct has also revealed how his efforts were frustrated by years of inaction, failures to fully alert the public, intervention from his superiors, and suspicions that the insurers were falsifying or withholding evidence. \u201cI am going public with this story because it doesn\u2019t seem right that the authorities say nothing to the public after finding health insurers breaking the law,\u201d he said. Cases such as Israel Folau\u2019s would be captured by the government\u2019s proposed religious discrimination bill, according to the attorney general, who says the legislation will include a \u201cpowerful avenue\u201d for people of faith who face \u201cindirect\u201d unfair treatment. Porter told Guardian Australia the legislation would include a clause intended to prevent employers putting in place a binding condition on employees \u2013 such as occurred with Rugby Australia \u2013 that restricted someone from expressing their religious views. Australia is responsible for 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions and could be contributing up to 17% by 2030 if pollution from its fossil fuel exports is factored in, research by Climate Analytics suggests. The Australian Conservation Foundation, which commissioned the research, said it showed Australia was on a path to being one of the worst contributors to the climate emergency. \u201cAustralia is now the number one exporter of both coal and gas and we are scheduled to push that off the charts in the next 10 years,\u201d the foundation\u2019s Gavan McFadzean said. \u201cWe are looking to become an emissions superpower.\u201d World The UK Foreign Office has ordered an inquiry into the leak of confidential internal memos presenting an unflattering portrait of Donald Trump and his administration. In cables written by Kim Darroch, the British ambassador to Washington, Trump\u2019s White House was described as \u201cuniquely dysfunctional\u201d and \u201cinept\u201d. Voters in Greece have given Kyriakos Mitsotakis\u2019 centre-right New Democracy party a resounding mandate to form a government after it won by a landslide over the incumbent leftwing Syriza party, which has ruled in coalition since 2015. Climate crisis disasters are happening at the rate of one a week, though most draw little international attention and work is urgently needed to prepare developing countries for the profound impacts, the UN has warned. Conflict broke out between hundreds of protesters and police in riot gear in Hong Kong on Sunday after tens of thousands of protesters marched peacefully to keep up the pressure on the government to withdraw its controversial extradition bill. At least 10 unexploded bombs dropped by the allies during the second world war are hidden within the foundations of the archaeological site of Pompeii, Italian media have reported. Opinion and analysis \u201cI am standing in the Old Bond Street headquarters of Stella McCartney\u2019s fashion empire,\u201d writes Sophie Heawood, \u201cwaiting to interview the designer and wondering why there are massive wet rocks surrounded by moss on the shopfloor. I ask the publicity assistant and it is surely a coincidence that the character Bubble from Absolutely Fabulous pops into my mind after she replies, in a voice imbued with significance and reverence: \u2018Nature.\u2019 It turns out that the rocks have been shipped down from Paul\u2019s farm on the Mull of Kintyre, where mist rolls in from the sea \u2013 the mist now rolls into his daughter\u2019s garments, apparently. \u201cI was like, Dad, this is weird \u2026 \u201d she explains, \u2018but can I have some rocks?\u2019\u201d It\u2019s more than 20 years since John Howard won the GST election, and Australia\u2019s record of significant reform since could be described as modest at best, writes Conal Hanna.

      "bodyText": "An excellent performance from Algeria: solid at the back, clever in midfield and incisive in attack. They\u2019ll fancy their chances of beating Mali or C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire - and anyone else besides. 90+2 min M\u2019Boli comes to flap at an aerial ball and Camara shoots fist time, but there are at least four defenders behind the keeper protecting the goalline and one of them blocks the ball clear. Algeria really, really want this. 90 min There\u2019ll be three added minutes. 88 min Mandi bumps Kamano, conceding a free0kick 25 yards from goal. Guinea try to take it quickly, but the ref pulls them back and Camara picks out Bangoura in the middle of the box. The ball is slightly behind him, but he should still do better than head powerfully over the top. 86 min Koita finds space, right side of the box, and drills a shot-cum-cross towards the back post. Sliding in, Kamano can\u2019t quite reach it. 85 min If Algeria maintain this level, they\u2019re a hard night for anyone. 83 min Delort comes on for Bounedjah, who\u2019s been desperate for a goal. It\u2019s not happened for him, but he\u2019s looked a threat all night and created space for others too. Just as we thought! Bennacer spreads wide to Atal, who crosses low and hard; Bounedjah pulls one man away, allowing Ounas to guide home a finish on the slide. That\u2019s another lovely goal, as Barry Davies would have it. 81 min Change for Algeria: Boudaoui replaces Guediora. 80 min Guinea win a free-kick on the right, deep inside the Algeria half, which Camara bends wickedly towards the back post. Koita is up, but Benlarmi does brilliantly to head clear, punching the air and hollering thereafter. 78 min Final shy for Guinea: Kamano replaces Yattara. 77 min There\u2019s not a whole lot coming to pass here. 76 min Ounas replaces Belaili. If Guinea leave space in behind, he might take advantage. 73 min Diawara has a kick at Belaili because why not. Algeria are doing well to maintain equilibrium here. 72 min Bangoura runs towards the box and darts a ball through to Traore, who can\u2019t control. 70 min Algeria have controlled this game really well; assuming they hang on, it\u2019ll be their first knockout win since winning the trophy in 1990. You could do worse than whip through this. 68 min Another change for Guinea: Bangoura replaces Cisse. 66 min Bounedjah goes down the right and crosses for Mahrez, who should make it 3-0, except he\u2019s too studied in his finish and hits it straight at Kone. 65 min Yattara moves the ball into Koita, who immediately gives it away. He just didn\u2019t know where his mates were likely to be, so guessed, and that\u2019s a major difference between the sides. 63 min Sylla heaves a cross into the box, where Koita shoves Benlamri. 61 min Algeria stroke it about and look like they\u2019ve a real chance of winning the competition. They\u2019ve got a lot of guile in midfield and up front, some individual brilliance, and a solid defence - they\u2019re still to concede a goal. 59 min I\u2019ve no idea how Guinea even begin to think about considering how they might potentially come up with an idea for a plan about what to do to find a way that might allow them to ponder whether they can get out of this. That\u2019s the difference! Class! Bensebani cuts in off the left and curves a lush pass over to Mahrez. His first touch is an erotic delight, caressing the ball into stride for his second, delivered after he adjusts his feet with little skip and leaning right with the ball punched left, as Kone dives the wrong way. That is brilliant, and Algeria are going through to the quarters! 56 min Change for Guinea: Koita replaces Kante. 55 min Yattara finds Kamara who has Kante pegging into the box, but suddenly, from 25 yards out, he discharges a swirler that M\u2019Boli shovels over the top. The corner comes to nothing, but that was Guinea\u2019s best moment of the match - admittedly a low bar. 54 min Benlarmi brings the ball away and Kante lunges through him, earning a richly-deserved booking from a richly biceped ref. 52 min Bennacer runs across Cisse, who yanks him back. Guinea are getting away with a lot of cynical, momentum-taxing fouls. 51 min The problem for Guinea is that they appear scoobiless as to how they might score a goal. 50 min This half is a bit messy so far, which is good news for Guinea. And the longer they can keep it at 0-1, then more nervous Algeria have scope to become. 47 min Mahrez flights a pass over the top for Bounedjah and Dyrestam brainlessly knocks him over. I\u2019m not certain it was in the box, but it was close ... and then an incorrect offside flag renders it irrelevant, Well played all round. 46 min Immediately, Algeria get their passing going again, then Guinea bring the ball away and Yattara steps on the ball. 46 min Off we go again. Apparently some Guinea fans rushed towards the tunnel at half-time, to dispense some stern words of encouragement to the players. As you might imagine, the players were overjoyed by this development. Back come the players. Guinea need to improve and Algeria need to do more with their possession. Half-time entertainment: Algeria have been by far the better side, missing an easy chance and scoring a lovely goal. Guinea are hoping something\u2019ll happen, more or less. 45+1 min Sylla, who\u2019s been Guinea\u2019s most significant threat, such that it is, batters through two challenges, stretches into the box, and flings himself to the floor. No penalty. 45 min There\u2019ll be one added minute. 45 min Benlarmi brings the ball out so Kante dashes through him. Somehow, he avoids a booking - that was a far worse foul than the one for which Guediora was booked. 43 min Atal rushes forward down the right and finds Mahrez, who sort of treads on the ball after misreading its path along the bobbles. It\u2019s not unamusing. 41 min Algeria knock it about. They\u2019re one of the more confident and organised sides in the competition, I\u2019d say. They have individuals able to alter the flow of things, but there\u2019s also cohesion between them in general play. 39 min Bounedjah glides away from his man and looks to attack the box, then treads on the ball instead. You absolutely hate to see it. 38 min Bounedjah drifts right and finds Atal, whose cross is easily collected by Kone. 36 min Tell you what, this Guinea kit is a belter. 34 min Lovely from Bounedjah, coming deep to turn and feed Fegouli, dashing into space. He feeds Mahrez, whose first touch is glorious, taking him away from Diawara before he megs Falette, but Sylla does really well to race across and insert himself between man and ball. 33 min Belaili, inside his own box, tries to duck outside Sylla, pressing him, but loses the ball and dangles fingers into face. On the burst, Sylla goes down, but the ref says no penalty. Another that VAR might just\u2019ve given; another that could do without being given. 31 min Dyrestam nashes down the right and humps over a cross towards the back post, seeking Yattara. But Atal is there to put him off, and Algeria bring the ball away. 30 min Guinea are getting a fair amount of the ball, but doing very little with it. 29 min Guediora into Feghouli, who beds a ball between Bounedjah and Kone ... Bounedjah might get it, but inexplicably checks his run. 27 min Algeria are much quicker too and off the ball - the decision to rest most of his first XI for the final group game is working out well. 26 min Belaili has been excellent so far. This is very nice, Belaili moving the ball into Bounedjah and running off him as Seka daydreams. He accepts the return and passes a deceptively easy-looking finish into the far corner, ball nuzzling betwen net and stanchion for extra artistic merit! 23 min Algeria force consecutive corners and when the second winds up with Belaili, he curls to the back post where Bounedjah sends an overhead kick over the top. 20 min Aaaarrrggghhh! Guediora swings a lovely ball over the top for Bounedjah, who brings it down beautifully, before opening his body to slot home, before punching over the bar from eight yards. That is very silly behaviour. 20 min Guinea are slinging too many long balls at Kante, but are playing pretty well otherwise. 17 min Guediora, on a yellow card, slides throug someone \u2013 I think it was Diawara \u2013 and somehow avoids a repeat performance. 17 min Guinea move it nicely through midfield, but Yattara then tries to waltz around two men and Benlamri mops up. 15 min Algeria need to move the ball quicker and get men forward in larger numbers. 14 min Mandi bumps Kante as the contest a high ball so the ref books Guediora, who was also there. 13 min A long ball over the top finds Bounedjah and he contrls, takes a touch, and rifles a riser inside the neat post. The ref reckons Falette stepped up in time but I\u2019m not at all sure. 12 min Incidentally, from the quarters onwards, VAR will be with us. Chauette! 11 min Bennacer and Kante contest am aerial ball inside the box, the latter wearing the forearm of the former. There\u2019s little remiss, but VAR would probably give a penalty on review. 10 min Bennacer into Belaili so Falette charges in to swipe him, doing well to avoid a card. 9 min This game is yet to settle. Algeria need to get Feghouli on the ball. 7 min Mahrez runs away as Belaili taps for Guediora; he slashes a drive that\u2019s wide and plenty. 6 min Mahrez runs past Camara, who blooters him because he can\u2019t resist the opportunity; that\u2019s a yellow card and a free-kick from 25 yards, almost dead centre. Or \u201cMahrez territory\u201d, as it\u2019s also known. 4 min Nice from Sylla, dashing down the left and exchanging passes with Traore and Camara. He runs out of position, so Bensebaini shepherds back to M\u2019Boli, who flicks behind his own leg ... and is robbed by Kante! But the ball runs kindly for Algeria and they clear. 3 min CAF need to find a way of getting more supporters into these games. They should insist that spares are distributed at local schools or somesuch. 2 min Belaili takes the kick himself, curling towards the back post. Mandi is up, but he can\u2019t quite get his head to it. 2 min Traore hauls down Belaili, giving Algeria a chance to curl a ball into the box from the left, 25 yards out. 1 min Off we go! I should note that Naby Keita is missing for Guinea. He\u2019s injured. The Algerian team and fans properly have it. Ah, unbeknownst to us, the players have come out. It\u2019s footballers singing out of tune time. I wonder how daring Algeria will be tonight. On the one hand, they want an open game; on the other, they don\u2019t want to be caught on the counter. In tournament football, teams tend to eliminate risk, but in this match I\u2019d expect that to be a leveller. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know that Gradel single handedly kept a terrible Toulouse team in Ligue 1,\u201d emails Alexandre Chesneau. \u201cCould Zaha do it on a rainy night in Amiens ? That\u2019s what I thought.\u201d I look forward to Arsenal signing him when it turns out that they can\u2019t, in fact, get Zaha for \u00a325 and a set of tracksuits. The players run over to their fans - they are absolutely buzzing - while Bolasie wipes sodium chloride and H20 from his eyes. This is amazing from Madagascar, making their first appearance in the competition! First, they diddle Nigeria to win the group, and now this! Bolasie swipes over the bar in woeful fashion! Mombris sees the keeper go, so sweeps into the middle of the goal. If Yannick Bolasie misses, DRC are out! M\u2019Poku goes down the middle and gets away with, it just. Fontaine does Ngumbi with the eyes, sweeping across him into the side-netting. Bakambu sidefoots firmly and finds the side-netting roughly halfway up. Metanire punches home, sending Ngumbi the wrong way. Tisserand leans back, picks his spot, and curls his kick over the bar! Amada scores for Madagascar! Madagascar and DRC will shortly shred their nerves and risk their reputations for our delectation. Looking at the draw, things have opened up very nicely for Senegal; Benin followed by one of the teams below looks a pretty generous route to the final. The bottom half of the draw, though, is harder to unravel. C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire have the strongest squad, but probably not the strongest team; currently, Wilfried Zaha is being kept out of it by Max Gradel. Yes, I know. They could easily lose to Mali tomorrow and then play tonight\u2019s winners; Nigeria will probably beat South Africa in the other quarter. Word to the wise: Madagascar and DRC are locked at 2-2 with five minutes of extra-time remaining. It\u2019s been a really good game, and one which deserves to be settled by the test of skill under pressure lottery that is a penalty shoot-out. The winners play Ghana or Tunisia next. As for Guinea, they make two changes: up front, Kante replaces Kaba, and behind him, Camara replaces Kamano. So Algeria revert to what is now, undoubtedly, their first XI, and the one which beat Senegal \u2013 there\u2019s no place for Ounas. I actually think it might be more of a 4-1-4-1 than a 4-3-3, with Guediora in front of the back four, but we\u2019ll see. Or, put another way: Algeria (4-3-3): M\u2019Bolhi; Atal, Mandi, Benlamri, Bensebaini; Guedioura, Bennacer, Feghouli; Mahrez, Bounedjah, Belaili. Guinea: (4-2-3-1): Kone; Dyrestam, Seka, Falette, Sylla; Cisse, Diawara; Yattara, Camara, Traore; Kante. Algeria qualified for this stage by beating Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania; Guinea qualified for this stage by drawing with Madagascar, losing to Nigeria and beating 10-man Burundi. Which is to say that it\u2019s fairly obvious what\u2019s going to happen tonight ... except this is football, and nothing is ever obvious. Just ask Egypt. Quite how Guinea stop Algeria, though, is open to question. If they sit back, they allow Riyad Mahrez, Isma\u00ebl Bennacer and Sofiane Feghouli to dominate possesion, and pick passes into the box; if they push on, Mahrez, Bennacer and Feghouli still dominate possession, and slide passes in behind. There\u2019ve been better choices. Chances are, Guinea pursue the former method and hope they can hold out, which might encourage Djamel Belmadi to retain Adam Ounas. He got a run out in the final group game and scored twice; his game-breaking quality might be useful tonight. Kick-off: 8pm BST, 9pm local time.",

On Sunday, Ocasio-Cortez seemed to welcome the comparison. The president\u2019s remarks are contained in American Carnage: On the Front Lines of the Republican Civil War, a book by Politico writer Tim Alberta that will be published on 16 July. The Guardian obtained a copy. Ocasio-Cortez, 29, rose to stardom last year when she defeated a member of House leadership, Joe Crowley, in a primary in Queens. She has become a figurehead of opposition to Trump in the House and a b\u00eate noire of Republicans and Fox News, for her championing of progressive causes including the Green New Deal.

Revered by many in her own country, she has been played in the West End and on Broadway by Elaine Paige and Patti LuPone and on film by Madonna. Ocasio-Cortez has been compared to Per\u00f3n before, on both sides of the partisan divide, including by the Republican commentator Charlie Sykes in remarks to the Guardian. Trump has not previously made the comparison. But he did write in a 2004 book that his \u201cfavorite Broadway show is Evita by Andrew Lloyd Webber, starring Patti LuPone.

      "bodyText": "After the USA claimed their fourth World Cup with a 2-0 victory over Netherlands in the final in Lyon on Sunday, Donald Trump tweeted his congratulations. Noting the team\u2019s \u201cgreat and exciting play\u201d, the president said: \u201cAmerica is proud of you all!\u201d It had however taken Trump more than an hour to remark on the result, a delay noted by many of his critics, particularly in light of controversy earlier in the tournament when the US co-captain Megan Rapinoe, a goalscorer in Lyon, said she would not visit the White House if the team won the title and were invited. In response to that, Trump said he was \u201cinviting the TEAM, win or lose. Megan should never disrespect our Country, the White House, or our Flag, especially since so much has been done for her [and] the team. Be proud of the Flag that you wear. The USA is doing GREAT!\u201d After the USA did \u201cgreat\u201d on Sunday the first lady, Melania Trump, was quicker than her husband to tweet her congratulations. Barack Obama was more expansive in his praise, writing: \u201cYes! Fourth star. Back to back. Congrats to the record breakers on the @USWNT, an incredible team that\u2019s always pushing themselves \u2013 and the rest of us \u2013 to be even better. Love this team. #OneNationOneTeam.\u201d Rapinoe\u2019s comments about Trump made a splash around the world. On Sunday the British shadow foreign secretary, Labour MP Emily Thornberry, congratulated her and took aim at Trump. \u201cCommiserations to the Netherlands and their brilliant Arsenal contingent,\u201d Thornberry wrote, \u201cbut I\u2019m delighted to see the US and Megan Rapinoe win that final on Pride Weekend.\u201d Rapinoe is an outspoken champion of LGBTQ rights. Thornberry added: \u201cEat that, Donald Trump.\u201d Less contentiously, and perhaps more diplomatically, a stream of celebrities and sports stars expressed their joy. The tennis great and equality campaigner Billie Jean King tweeted: \u201cCongratulations to the #USWNT on their fourth World Cup win!

Signing talented, conscientious players with plenty to prove is a fine strategy so long as those players are sure to be given the guidance they still need. If Maguire and Wan-Bissaka were signed by Liverpool or Manchester City, then they could be confident that J\u00fcrgen Klopp or Pep Guardiola would help them to fulfil their potential within a smartly run collective. When Mauricio Pochettino promised Tanguy Ndombele this summer that he would turn him into a world-class player if he left Lyon for Tottenham, the player had good reason to believe him. Whatever about trophies, Pochettino\u2019s coaching record gives him credibility. The evidence of Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s coaching skills is decidedly skimpy in comparison.</p> <p>United are banking on players with varying amounts of potential being cultivated quickly by a manager of uncertain potential at a club where other key figures are unconvincing or, in the case of the director of football, unknown.</p> <p>Which brings us back to the question of paying \u00a390m for a defender from Leicester. United have to factor in the value of weakening rivals for a top-six finish.</p>",

United\u2019s new right-back, Wan-Bissaka, is better than most players his age and could prove a bargain at \u00a345m but Crystal Palace fans can point to basic mistakes he made last season and he, too, had a bad summer with England, scoring an own goal at the Under-21 European Championship before being dropped by Aidy Boothroyd, who said the player had been distracted by the imminent move to United. This is where Solskj\u00e6r has to show his worth. Signing talented, conscientious players with plenty to prove is a fine strategy so long as those players are sure to be given the guidance they still need. If Maguire and Wan-Bissaka were signed by Liverpool or Manchester City, then they could be confident that J\u00fcrgen Klopp or Pep Guardiola would help them to fulfil their potential within a smartly run collective. When Mauricio Pochettino promised Tanguy Ndombele this summer that he would turn him into a world-class player if he left Lyon for Tottenham, the player had good reason to believe him. Whatever about trophies, Pochettino\u2019s coaching record gives him credibility. The evidence of Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s coaching skills is decidedly skimpy in comparison. United are banking on players with varying amounts of potential being cultivated quickly by a manager of uncertain potential at a club where other key figures are unconvincing or, in the case of the director of football, unknown. Which brings us back to the question of paying \u00a390m for a defender from Leicester. United have to factor in the value of weakening rivals for a top-six finish.",

Make no mistake: Harmer was not at his best in returning five for 76 as Yorkshire were bowled out for 208 midway through the day. </p> <p>Last week, in defeating Nottinghamshire, he returned four for 35 from 40 second\u2011innings overs. Here he conceded three leg-side sixes but did enough on the way to a sixth haul of five wickets or more this summer. Essex, second with Yorkshire in third, ended the day on 122 for three.</p> <p>Division One Leaders <strong>Somerset</strong> were challenged by the bottom side, <strong>Nottinghamshire</strong>, at Taunton although they finished strongly at 326 all out. Reduced to 145 for six after lunch, their recovery was led by Steve Davies and Dom Bess, who hit 74 and 51, and shared 128.</p> <p>The champions, <strong>Surrey</strong>, whose title defence is no more after defeat against Yorkshire last week, played out an even first day against <strong>Kent</strong> at the Oval, with rain and bad light disrupting play. Dean Elgar (63) and Ben Foakes (57 not out) played the feature innings in 244 for six. The Ashes hopeful Dom Sibley was out for 16 as <strong>Warwickshire</strong> replied to <strong>Hampshire\u2019s</strong> 539 with 198 for three on day two at the Ageas Bowl.</p> <p>In Division Two, unbeaten <strong>Lancashire</strong> were put under early pressure by <strong>Northamptonshire </strong>at Wantage Road. Lancashire started this round three points behind Glamorgan, who do not play this week, with a game in hand. Temba Bavuma\u2019s 103 marked his first Championship century and underpinned 334 for five. Ricardo Vasconcelos (77) and the captain, Adam Rossington (76 not out) provided valuable support.</p> <p>It was a helter-skelter opening day at Kidderminster between <strong>Worcestershire</strong> and <strong>Derbyshire</strong>, with 20 wickets falling. Derbyshire were bowled out for 108 before Worcestershire replied with 113. Derbyshire closed on 19 without loss in their second innings.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d221ab28f0845f89e3085c0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-07T16:16:29.193Z\">5.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Crikey. It\u2019s all happening at Kidderminster</strong>, where Worcestershire are 70 for 5 in reply to Derbyshire\u2019s 108 all out. Daryl Mitchell, Callum Ferguson and Riki Wessels all fell for 13, while Ed Barnard has 17. Nobody has yet made it beyond 31 in the match. Here, Duanne Olivier has just entered the Yorkshire attack to bowl the 27th over, coming on fourth change with Essex 74 for 2. It is a sign that he hasn\u2019t yet hit his straps in a Yorkshire shirt. I can only think that they gave Matthew Fisher the new ball in the hope that a pitch-up bowler would be far more effective on this track, which hasn\u2019t been Olivier\u2019s style so far for the White Rose.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d2216558f08cf92bb76b143\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-07T15:57:39.270Z\">4.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>I have an apology to make</strong> to the Glamorgan fans who have pointed out to me on email that Lancashire are indeed not the leaders of Division Two. However, given they don\u2019t play this week and Lancashire, who have a game in hand, are only two points behind, that will almost certainly change pretty sharpish no matter the result of their clash with Northants at Wantage Road. Here at Chelmsford, Essex have lost a second. Sir Alastair has gone, caught behind off Steve Patterson with one that nipped away a touch. They are now 66 for 2.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d2209198f08cf92bb76b0ca\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-07T15:01:08.411Z\">4.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Northants are in extremely good order</strong> against the Division Two leaders Lancashire at Wantage Road.

Derbyshire are also all out at Kidderminster for 108 against Worcestershire, while Durham are 115 for 9 against Leicestershire at Grace Road.

It was an incredible game of cricket which I\u2019d be surprised to see a repeat of for a very long time. I\u2019ve seen some amazing cricket on this ground. In 2013, I saw Essex bowled out for 20 in the second innings of a defeat to Lancashire. If this week\u2019s clash is half as entertaining, we\u2019ll be in for a treat. </p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Last May, on the first day between Essex and Yorkshire, 22 wickets fell and the visitors were bowled out for 50 \u2013 but a side including Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow recovered to win. This year, wickets still fell but not at that rate, and it is Essex who hold the advantage thanks largely to another five wickets for the South African off\u2011spinner Simon Harmer on a spin- and seam-friendly pitch. Make no mistake: Harmer was not at his best in returning five for 76 as Yorkshire were bowled out for 208 midway through the day. Last week, in defeating Nottinghamshire, he returned four for 35 from 40 second\u2011innings overs. Here he conceded three leg-side sixes but did enough on the way to a sixth haul of five wickets or more this summer. Essex, second with Yorkshire in third, ended the day on 122 for three. Division One Leaders Somerset were challenged by the bottom side, Nottinghamshire, at Taunton although they finished strongly at 326 all out. Reduced to 145 for six after lunch, their recovery was led by Steve Davies and Dom Bess, who hit 74 and 51, and shared 128. The champions, Surrey, whose title defence is no more after defeat against Yorkshire last week, played out an even first day against Kent at the Oval, with rain and bad light disrupting play. Dean Elgar (63) and Ben Foakes (57 not out) played the feature innings in 244 for six. The Ashes hopeful Dom Sibley was out for 16 as Warwickshire replied to Hampshire\u2019s 539 with 198 for three on day two at the Ageas Bowl. In Division Two, unbeaten Lancashire were put under early pressure by Northamptonshire at Wantage Road. Lancashire started this round three points behind Glamorgan, who do not play this week, with a game in hand. Temba Bavuma\u2019s 103 marked his first Championship century and underpinned 334 for five. Ricardo Vasconcelos (77) and the captain, Adam Rossington (76 not out) provided valuable support. It was a helter-skelter opening day at Kidderminster between Worcestershire and Derbyshire, with 20 wickets falling. Derbyshire were bowled out for 108 before Worcestershire replied with 113. Derbyshire closed on 19 without loss in their second innings. Crikey. It\u2019s all happening at Kidderminster, where Worcestershire are 70 for 5 in reply to Derbyshire\u2019s 108 all out. Daryl Mitchell, Callum Ferguson and Riki Wessels all fell for 13, while Ed Barnard has 17. Nobody has yet made it beyond 31 in the match. Here, Duanne Olivier has just entered the Yorkshire attack to bowl the 27th over, coming on fourth change with Essex 74 for 2. It is a sign that he hasn\u2019t yet hit his straps in a Yorkshire shirt. I can only think that they gave Matthew Fisher the new ball in the hope that a pitch-up bowler would be far more effective on this track, which hasn\u2019t been Olivier\u2019s style so far for the White Rose. I have an apology to make to the Glamorgan fans who have pointed out to me on email that Lancashire are indeed not the leaders of Division Two. However, given they don\u2019t play this week and Lancashire, who have a game in hand, are only two points behind, that will almost certainly change pretty sharpish no matter the result of their clash with Northants at Wantage Road. Here at Chelmsford, Essex have lost a second. Sir Alastair has gone, caught behind off Steve Patterson with one that nipped away a touch. They are now 66 for 2. Northants are in extremely good order against the Division Two leaders Lancashire at Wantage Road. They have reached tea at 215 for 4, including Ricardo Vasconcelos\u2019s 77 and Temba Bavuma\u2019s unbeaten 52. Lancashire are under pressure, which hasn\u2019t happened to them too often this season. Here at Chelmsford, Essex have reached tea at 42 for 1 and are in rude health. Things can change quickly, however, on this pitch. Essex may have lost Nick Browne to a superb one-handed catch from Matthew Fisher in his follow through, but Tom Westley has just hit four fours in the ninth over off Ben Coad to give Essex a useful start to their reply to 208. They are 36 for 1 as we approach tea. Now Durham have been bowled out for 117, with Leicestershire\u2019s Chris Wright taking five for 30. Yorkshire are all out for 208, with Simon Harmer claiming his fifth wicket as Matthew Fisher is lbw sweeping. The South African finishes with five for 76. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad score on a pitch which will only get worse, and it hasn\u2019t started great. Derbyshire are also all out at Kidderminster for 108 against Worcestershire, while Durham are 115 for 9 against Leicestershire at Grace Road. Back up into Division One, the law of sod is being applied at Taunton. Notts have had a dreadful campaign, yet they are giving leaders Somerset something to think about. Somerset are 157 for 6. Simon Harmer may have taken four wickets, but he hasn\u2019t been at his best. He\u2019s conceded more than four an over, including being hit for three leg-side sixes \u2013 the latest from Ben Coad. Yorkshire are in a handy position at 201 for 8. Interesting dismissal at Taunton as Tom Banton is dismissed hit wicket against R Ashwin as he attempts to prevent a ball dribbling back onto his stumps. Somerset 132 for 5. Joe Leach has struck three times since lunch at Kidderminster, with Derbyshire reduced to 63 for 6. Leach removed Luis Reece, Harvey Hosein and Matt Critchley. Here at Chelmsford, Keshav Maharaj has just launched Simon Harmer over deep mid-wicket for six, and Yorkshire are 151 for 6. Early afternoon success for Simon Harmer, who has Jonny Tattersall caught behind for 23 with his first ball after lunch, leaving him on a hat-trick having bowled Harry Brook just beforehand. Hat-trick ball, against fellow South African spinner Keshav Maharaj, produced a half-hearted lbw appeal. Yorkshire are 133 for 6 with Matthew Fisher and Maharaj together. Division One Hampshire 539 v Warwickshire 15-1, Ageas Bowl - Hampshire consolidated their position of strength with the wicket of Will Rhodes, caught behind off Kyle Abbott, in the final over of the morning. Essex v Yorkshire 128-5, Chelmsford \u2013 two wickets apiece for Jamie Porter and Simon Harmer, including a 50th wicket of the season for the latter. He bowled Harry Brook in the last over before lunch after a recovery from 69-4. Brook made 46. Somerset 111-3 v Nottinghamshire, Taunton \u2013 wickets for Luke Wood, R Ashwin and Jake Ball in a competitive start to top versus bottom. Surrey 31-1 v Kent, Oval \u2013 delayed start to 12pm due to a wet outfield. Surrey lost Mark Stoneman for a duck. Rory Burns has reached 8,000 first-class runs for Surrey. Division Two Leicestershire v Durham 76-5, Grace Road \u2013 Cameron Bancroft has 36 not out and is trying to patch things together after a sticky start for the visitors. Middlesex 70-2 v Gloucestershire, Merchant Taylors\u2019 School \u2013 new ball wickets for Josh Shaw and Aussie Chad Sayers. Nick Gubbins and Dawid Malan at the crease. Northamptonshire 104-1 v Lancashire, Wantage Road \u2013 a challenging morning for the leaders, who are without Jimmy Anderson (calf). Graham Onions struck, but Ricardo Vasconcelos has 59 not out. Worcestershire v Derbyshire 63-3, Kidderminster \u2013 a decent start for the Pears through morning wickets for Dillon Pennington, Ed Barnard and Charlie Morris, including key duo Billy Godleman and Wayne Madsen. Rory Burns, upon reaching three, brought up 8,000 career first-class runs for Surrey, who are 10 for 1 in the early stages against Kent at the Oval. Mark Stoneman was trapped lbw for a duck by Harry Podmore. Burns has five and Dean Elgar three. A 50th Championship wicket of the season for Simon Harmer, who traps Tom Kohler-Cadmore lbw with one that turned and seemed to keep low. Yorkshire are 69 for 4. Wickets all around the grounds, and they\u2019re just getting underway between Surrey and Kent at the Oval following a delayed start due to a wet outfield. Kent have opted to bowl first. There\u2019s also an injury update on Jimmy Anderson\u2019s fitness from the ECB. Here\u2019s the full statement: \u201cEngland seam bowler Jimmy Anderson, who left the field during Lancashire\u2019s Specsavers County Championship match against Durham at Sedbegh School on Tuesday July 2 due to tightness to his right calf, underwent an MRI scan on Friday. The MRI confirmed that Anderson has suffered a low grade calf muscle tear. As a result of the injury, he will commence a rehabilitation programme with the England and Lancashire CCC medical teams. \u201cAnderson will miss Lancashire\u2019s next two Championship matches against Northants and Sussex. \u201cHe will be reassessed on an ongoing basis regarding his availability for the Specsavers Test match versus Ireland at Lord\u2019s on July 24 and the Specsavers Ashes Series against Australia starting on August 1.\u201d Here\u2019s our full story: Yorkshire are three down, 45 for 3. Since my last post they have lost Gary Ballance, bowled around his legs for eight by Peter Siddle, who uprooted leg-stump, and Will Fraine, caught behind off a Jamie Porter away nipper for 29. A quartet of wickets to report, the first here at Chelmsford. Adam Lyth has been caught at point by Nick Browne having skewed a drive at Jamie Porter for five, the ball after surviving a huge caught behind appeal. Yorkshire are 18 for 1. At the Ageas Bowl, Hampshire have lost Gareth Berg, bowled by Oliver Hannon-Dalby (they\u2019re now 473-7). In Division Two, Leicestershire\u2019s Muhammad Abbas has trapped Alex Lees lbw at Grace Road. Durham are 11 for 1. Derbyshire have also lost Billy Godleman to Dillon Pennington at Kidderminster and are 13-1. There\u2019s been plenty of oohs and arghs so far from the Essex bowlers and slip cordon, including an lbw shout from Jamie Porter against Adam Lyth with the first ball of the match. But Yorkshire have moved to 18 for 0 in the fifth over through Lyth and Will Fraine. There seems to be a bit of variable bounce in this pitch. Notts have made three changes to their team for the clash with leaders Somerset at Taunton as they look to spark their season into life. They have handed a debut to the Sunderland-born Liam Patterson-White, a 20-year-old who bats left-handed and bowls left-arm spin.

      "bodyText": "Congressional approval for funds for the Trump administration to spend at the southern border has triggered open warfare between a \u201csquad\u201d of high-profile progressive House Democrats and party leaders they accuse of caving to a White House determined to mistreat migrant children. The split became brutally evident late last month when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts \u2013 together known as \u201cThe Squad\u201d \u2013 voted against when Pelosi moved to pass a Senate bill that provided $4.59bn in border security funding. Critics said the bill would not ensure that the money was spent to relieve squalid and overcrowded conditions in holding facilities run by Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Responding on Twitter, Omar said: \u201cA vote for Mitch McConnell\u2019s border bill is a vote to keep kids in cages and terrorize immigrant communities.\u201d Tlaib declared: \u201cIf you see the Senate bill as an option, then you don\u2019t believe in basic human rights.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said: \u201cHell no. That\u2019s an abdication of power.\u201d On Saturday, Pelosi responded in a New York Times interview, taking aim at The Squad for voting against \u201cour bill\u201d. \u201cAll these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t have any following. They\u2019re four people and that\u2019s how many votes they got.\u201d In a tweeted response, Ocasio-Cortez said: \u201cThat public \u2018whatever\u2019 is called public sentiment. And wielding the power to shift it is how we actually achieve meaningful change in this country.\u201d She also defended her use of social media. The progressive-moderate split is becoming more evident and bitter. \u201cIf the left doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m left enough, so be it,\u201d Pelosi told the Times. Referring to her long career and past defeats for progressive policy priorities, the speaker, 79, added: \u201cAs I say to these people, come to my basement. I have these signs about single-payer [healthcare] from 30 years ago. \u201cI understand what they\u2019re saying. But we have a responsibility to get something done, which is different from advocacy. We have to have a solution, not just a Twitter fight.\u201d The Times columnist Maureen Dowd, who had lunch with Pelosi, wrote that the speaker \u201cpinned the blame for the border bill on [Senate majority leader] Mitch McConnell\u201d and said that after it passed, she received a congratulatory phone call from Donald Trump, who was abroad at the time. \u201cI actually think if he were here, we might have had a better shot\u201d at getting more of what the Democrats wanted in the bill, Pelosi said, adding: \u201cOne thing he understands is the public view of things.\u201d Such bonhomie is likely to further inflame House progressives. Many younger Democrats accuse older members led by Pelosi of refusing to stand up for principle and of being too afraid of defeat should the party work for impeachment, Medicare for All, a $15 minimum wage, free public college, the Green New Deal or other elements of the progressive agenda. \u201cLeadership is driven by fear,\u201d Corbin Trent, a spokesman for Ocasio-Cortez and a co-founder of Justice Democrats, told the Washington Post. \u201cThey seem to be unable to lead.\u201d \u201cThe greatest threat to mankind is the cowardice of the Democratic party,\u201d Trent added. Ocasio-Cortez told the Post fear of losing is beside the point for new party members. \u201cWhat\u2019s important isn\u2019t just winning but fighting,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t care about losing in the short term, because we know we\u2019re fighting for the long term.\u201d On Sunday, Tlaib disputed claims by acting homeland security secretary Kevin McAleenan that the additional funds are a way to get children out of CBP custody.

With a talented and youthful generation \u2013 only one member of the starting XI was born before 1990 \u2013 the Netherlands will be back. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of potential in the team \u2013 we still have an average age under 26,\u201d added Wiegman. With attacking prowess, midfield mettle and an outstanding goalkeeper the Netherlands are an ascendant force in world football. The Dutch expressions full of longing from the side of the pitch as jubilant American players swam in confetti said it all. Their hunger for the trophy lifted before their eyes by the USA will not abate. Earlier in the tournament the Brazilian superstar Marta said: \u201cCry at the beginning so you can smile at the end.\u201d Sunday was a day of teary heartbreak for the Dutch national team. But after the Netherlands exceeded all expectations to reach the final at only their second World Cup it would be no surprise to see them smiling in 2023.",

The layoffs, equivalent to 20% of the bank\u2019s workforce, come after chief executive Christian Sewing flagged an extensive restructuring in May, when he promised shareholders \u201ctough cutbacks\u201d to the investment bank and that he would push ahead with a further \u20ac1bn (\u00a3880m) in cuts this year. The pledge came after similar moves in 2018 that led to 6,000 job losses, and a failure to agree a merger with rival Commerzbank. Deutsche Bank, which has recently come under scrutiny over its business relationship with Donald Trump, would not reveal how many staff in its UK operations would be put out of work in the latest round of redundancies, although the numbers are expected to be significant, as London \u2013 where the bank is in the process of constructing a new headquarters \u2013 is one of of the lender\u2019s largest bases, with around 8,000 staff. Sewing, who has been in the job for just over a year, said: \u201cWe are tackling what is necessary to unleash our full potential \u2026 We are building on our strengths. This is a restart for Deutsche Bank.\u201d Paul Achleitner, chairman of Deutsche\u2019s supervisory board, said: \u201cDeutsche Bank has been through a difficult period over the past decade, but with this new strategy in place, we now have every reason to look forward with confidence and optimism.\u201d Deutsche Bank has suffered multiple blows to its reputation over the past year, having failed US bank stress tests, suffered downgrades to its investment grade ratings, and had its offices raided by German police in November as part of a money-laundering investigation linked to the Panama Papers revelations. Following the raid, the bank said that it had \u201cno concrete evidence that would support the allegations against us or any of our employees\u201d. The bank has also paid billions in fines and settlements relating to behaviour before and after the global financial crisis, including a $7.2bn settlement in 2017 with the US Justice Department over the sale of bonds based on mortgages to people with unreliable credit. As a lender to Trump, despite a series of corporate bankruptcies and defaults starting in the early 1990s, Deutsche Bank has been subpoenaed by two congressional committees for documents as part of investigations into the US president and his company.

The idea is with trust in politicians at an all-time low, the wider community is more likely to put their faith in the opinions of random strangers.</p> <p>The concept has merit, and early experiments have been promising, but the potential for expansion inevitably comes back to trust. Who was selected and why? Was it fixed somehow? And perhaps more pertinently in an era where cynicism reigns, how do you prove it wasn\u2019t?</p> <p>One way would be to include more than a few dozen people.

      "bodyText": "Perhaps they hated Bill Shorten. Maybe they loved Scott Morrison. They might have feared a \u201cretiree tax\u201d. Or a \u201ccarbon tax\u201d. Or a \u201cdeath tax\u201d. They could have wanted to see the Adani mine built. Or feared for the seizure of their V8 ute in exchange for an electric vehicle. They might not care for their local member. Or they might think he or she is excellent. Maybe they love rugby league. Or hate jogging. Or fear asylum seekers. Or despise class war rhetoric. In our political system there are countless potential reasons for the selection of one party over another; claiming a \u201cmandate\u201d for any individual policy seems optimistic. When a significant part of said policy doesn\u2019t take effect for five years, the claim seems particularly specious. And still, I fear our political system is approaching permanent stasis, with each party constantly trying to neutralise and stymie the other so that we go backwards through sheer inaction. It\u2019s more than 20 years since John Howard won the GST election, and Australia\u2019s record of significant reform since could be described as modest at best. The drum beats are getting louder, with Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe repeatedly calling since May for structural reform to support fiscal and monetary stimulus measures to boost the economy. Meanwhile, the Henry tax review of 2010, Tony Shepherd\u2019s 2014 Commission of Audit report, and a Tony Abbott-sponsored tax discussion paper are just some of the many documents gathering dust as governments have struggled to make headway. It\u2019s been a golden age for scare campaigns, on both sides of politics. Work Choices, the mining tax, pokies reforms, the emissions trading scheme, GP fees and mortgage broking changes are just some of the policies to have fallen victim to large-scale anti-reform campaigns run, as a general rule, by people with a healthy degree of political or economic self interest. Add in voters\u2019 recent rejection of Labor\u2019s ambitious policy agenda, and is it any wonder politicians are in no rush to pursue meaningful reform? We have become a risk-averse nation, increasingly in thrall to the idea that change \u2013 particularly anything that affects us personally \u2013 is to be resisted. So how does a government achieve anything approaching structural reform? One model being tested by newDemocracy involves the creation of citizens\u2019 juries, where a random selection of a few dozen people research an issue, learn from experts whom they select, and come to an informed opinion about thorny policy areas. The idea is with trust in politicians at an all-time low, the wider community is more likely to put their faith in the opinions of random strangers. The concept has merit, and early experiments have been promising, but the potential for expansion inevitably comes back to trust. Who was selected and why? Was it fixed somehow? And perhaps more pertinently in an era where cynicism reigns, how do you prove it wasn\u2019t? One way would be to include more than a few dozen people. The 2017 same-sex marriage plebiscite was ridiculed as a waste of $81m to pass a law that the majority of both the populace and the parliament supported. Well, yes. But. The one thing the plebiscite did was remove the ability for a vocal minority to hijack the political system to inflict their views on the rest. Given the trajectory of many other reforms in recent times, this is no small feat. Here the government was given a very clear mandate to implement. And it\u2019s worth nothing that no one is campaigning to repeal the Marriage Amendment Act. So why not more plebiscites?

A pre-existing condition (PEC) is defined as any illness, ailment, or condition for which signs or symptoms existed six months before a claimant took out insurance. Those with pre-existing conditions must wait 12 months before making a related claim for hospital cover. Without such a requirement, customers who get sick or foresee the need for hospital treatment could simply take out a policy, immediately make a claim, and then end or downgrade their policy once the hospital treatment ends. This effectively forces other policy-holders to cover the obvious costs incurred by the insurer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What must insurers do before rejecting a claim due to a pre-existing medical condition? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The law requires insurers appoint a medical practitioner to review claims before they are rejected on PEC grounds. The doctor, paid by the insurer, reviews the medical evidence and considers advice from the customer\u2019s treating physician. The insurer\u2019s doctor must be satisfied that there is a direct link between the sickness or injury that is the subject of the claim, and the signs or symptoms that existed in the six months prior to taking out insurance.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What can the commonwealth ombudsman do to investigate complaints? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The commonwealth ombudsman acts as the public watchdog of private health insurers. It responds to individual complaints about a range of insurer conduct, including costs, service and the quality of advice. The ombudsman has a small team dedicated to private health insurance matters, which previously operated as a standalone agency, the private health insurance ombudsman. The team gets through a huge volume of work. It investigates thousands of complaints against private health insurers each year, and the numbers have almost doubled in the past decade. In 2017-18 alone, the ombudsman investigated 4,553 complaints against health insurers, 367 of which were related to pre-existing conditions. When someone complains about a pre-existing condition rejection, the ombudsman asks the customer for medical certificates from their treating physician, and requests the insurer provide its own doctor\u2019s assessment and the outcome letter sent to the customer. A case officer weighs up the evidence and can resolve it themselves, seek the advice of colleagues or superiors, or escalate the complaint up to senior management.&nbsp;<br><br>Where it suspects the insurer was wrong, the ombudsman can seek a review by an independent medical advisor. If the independent advice also finds wrongdoing, the ombudsman writes to the insurer and asks them to reconsider its decision.<br><br>Where more systemic failings are detected, like those at Bupa and NIB, the ombudsman can either warn the insurer directly or refer the matter to the Department of Health, which acts as the regulator.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Documents show insurance giant NIB has repeatedly failed to have doctors review such cases for the past seven years.</p> \n<p>NIB has privately admitted to the commonwealth ombudsman, which investigates complaints against private health insurers, that its processes were not \u201caligned to the legislative requirements\u201d due to \u201csome pre-existing condition determinations not being undertaken by a medical practitioner\u201d.</p> \n<p>The public has not been told of NIB\u2019s failings, despite referrals to the regulator.

The ombudsman did not mount an investigation to uncover the full extent of Bupa\u2019s failings. Documents also show that a third insurer, HCF, was twice questioned about its apparent failure to engage doctors to review claims, once in June 2016 and again in March 2018. One investigator\u2019s attempts to investigate the 2018 complaint were hampered by allegations that HCF was withholding evidence \u2013 a claim HCF now rejects. HCF\u2019s behaviour prompted the investigator to raise the case with his superiors, but he was allegedly told he was \u201ctoo invested\u201d and to leave the case alone. When he persisted, he was sidelined and told he could no longer investigate pre-existing condition rejections. Documents seen by Guardian Australia confirm the investigator was told to cease pursuing such cases, though the ban was lifted four months later.

But a spokesman said this occurred only when the insurer believed it had \u201cvery clear\u201d advice from the customer\u2019s treating physician about when symptoms began. NIB said it had changed its processes in October 2018 to fix the problem. The company said it had also reviewed all the potentially compromised rejections in the past seven years, and is now reimbursing affected customers. \u201cAs part of this review, we identified a small number of people had their claims rejected on the basis of an incorrect pre-existing condition decision,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cOur appointed medical practitioner has reviewed each case and we have been promptly reimbursing these people their correct benefit entitlement and associated interest.

      "bodyText": "Cases such as Israel Folau\u2019s would be captured by the government\u2019s proposed religious discrimination bill, according to the attorney general, who says the legislation will include a \u201cpowerful avenue\u201d for people of faith who face \u201cindirect\u201d unfair treatment. However, Christian Porter is holding firm against calls from conservative MPs to establish a religious freedom act, saying such legislation could see \u201csensitive public policy\u201d determined by the courts as it adjudicated competing rights. Speaking to Guardian Australia after briefing more than 20 government MPs in Canberra on Friday, Porter said the legislation would include a clause relating to indirect discrimination, mirrored on section 7b of the sex discrimination act. He believed this would prevent employers from putting in place a binding condition on all employees \u2013 such as occurred with Rugby Australia \u2013 that restricted someone from expressing their religious views. \u201cThis would provide an overarching rule that places limitations on what an employer could do by way of general rules that affected all of their workforce, if those general rules, in an unfair and unreasonable way, had a negative \u2013 or what the legislation calls a disadvantaging \u2013 effect on a person of faith,\u201d he said. \u201cA bill like this would provide a very powerful avenue for someone who believed that a general rule in their employment especially disadvantaged them because of their religion, to argue that that rule was contrary to the act and unfair.\u201d The move to assure MPs of the merits of the proposed religious discrimination act comes after Rugby Australia terminated the contract of star player Folau for a widely condemned social media post in which he said \u201cdrunks, homosexuals, adulterers, liars, fornicators, thieves, atheists and idolaters\u201d would go to hell unless they repented. The case is headed to the federal court. Porter said once the religious discrimination legislation came into effect, it would prevent employment contracts being made that were in breach of the new commonwealth law. \u201cWhen two private parties contract with each other \u2013 an employer and an employee \u2013 they can\u2019t contract to do something that another piece of law, in this case commonwealth law, says is unlawful,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bill \u2026 provides an avenue for people who think a rule in their employment has unfairly disadvantaged them or led to their termination unfairly because of their religion, provides an avenue for complaint and potentially redress in those circumstances, and so it goes a long way to protect people from being discriminated against in the context of their employment.\u201d When asked if he believed Folau should have been free to express his view on social media, Porter said the case was about \u201ccompeting principles\u201d and he was unable to give an answer \u201cas a lawyer\u201d. But he \u201cpersonally\u201d had concerns about the ability of a corporation to restrict the views of an individual in their private life. \u201cI think a real issue arises here about how much and to what extent modern businesses \u2013 whether they are sporting codes or law firms \u2013 attempt to limit people\u2019s behaviour in their private life and in their private discussions and in their private discourse outside of work hours based on an argument that there is what is sometimes called brand damage to the overall organisation,\u201d he said. He believed there was \u201cdisquiet\u201d among Australians about the Folau case. \u201cWe have probably reached a point where the ability of employers to control people in their non work time is getting tested,\u201d he said. Conservative MPs have seized on the Folau case as an example of why the federal government needs to do more to protect people of faith, and NSW senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells has launched a petition for a religious freedom act. Fierravanti-Wells has argued that the proposed religious discrimination act would \u201cfall well short\u201d of the expectations among those who voted for the Coalition who were concerned about their religious freedoms being curtailed. \u201c[A religious discrimination act] would be defensive in nature and limited to protecting against acts and practices by others which are discriminatory on the grounds of religion,\u201d she told the Senate on Tuesday. \u201cQuiet Australians now expect the Coalition to legislate to protect their religious freedom. It is important that Australians of all faiths be free to practise their religion without discrimination. Even those who have no beliefs should be free to express those views.\u201d But Porter said the government was doing \u201cprecisely what we said we would do\u201d at the election. He believed a \u201cclassical formulation of rights\u201d that protected people from the behaviour of other people through the architecture of anti-discrimination bills was superior to a religious freedom bill. \u201cAs soon as you say, \u2018Here is a bill that says everyone has a right to freedom of speech, everyone has got a right to freedom of association, to freedom of religion\u2019 they all start competing with each other, and eventually you get the circumstance that you have got in America where the highest court in the land decides what is more important: the right to free choice or the right to life, and then the decisions around how the boundaries on really, really sensitive public policy decisions are made get made by courts.\u201d The prime minister, Scott Morrison, told the first partyroom meeting of the new parliament that he did not want the issue of religious freedom to become divisive or politicised. He urged MPs to give Porter feedback through a series of workshops. He has also flagged a bipartisan approach, saying he wants to work with Labor on the \u201cdeeply personal\u201d issue. Equality Australia has said it agrees in theory that discrimination on the basis of religion should be outlawed, but has warned that the new law must be a \u201cshield not a sword\u201d against LGBTI people. Porter is holding seminars with MPs over the next six to eight weeks and has already revised the legislation multiple times. After the internal consultations are complete, Porter said he would begin external consultations. The legislation will be introduced in the second half of this year.",

      "body": "<p>It became clear after 13 minutes that this was going to be a different kind of game for the USA. The Netherlands, it turned out, were different from any team they had faced at this World Cup. But the US had something no other side in the tournament had: Megan Rapinoe, the biggest star of the World Cup, and the confidence she embodies.</p> \n<p>After steamrolling their way through the rest of the tournament and scoring within 12 minutes in every game, the mighty Americans had to wait an agonizing 61 minutes to score against a team that very much got their tactics right. Although the Dutch goalkeeper, Sari van Veenendaal, was called on to make a handful of saves, the Netherlands were more organized and gave the Americans less space than any other team in this World Cup. The Americans\u2019 tactics often looked stale \u2013 they tried their darnedest to come out as the aggressors, just as they have this entire tournament, by playing direct and looking to spring attackers in behind.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/07/womens-world-cup-final-report-usa-netherlands\">Megan Rapinoe on the spot as USA beat Netherlands to win Women\u2019s World Cup</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But the final came down to the composure of the most unflappable player in the World Cup, the magnetic pink-haired Rapinoe. It could not have been more poetic and more fitting that, after weeks of discussion about Rapinoe \u2013 from the media who loved having someone interesting to write about, the other teams who feared or admired her, and even the president of the United States who was apparently annoyed by her \u2013 she would be the one to step up to the penalty spot and break the deadlock.</p> \n<p>After a video review Alex Morgan earned the penalty, challenging for a ball that the Dutch defender Stefanie van der Gragt put a high boot to and missed, catching Morgan. The cool-as-ice Rapinoe stepped up to the spot and hit her penalty with pace \u2013 it was comfortable and natural, much like Rapinoe has seemed to be throughout the grind of this World Cup.</p> \n<p>Once Rapinoe scored the USA\u2019s victory was not in doubt \u2013 that\u2019s just the way the US have looked when scoring first in this World Cup. The momentum had finally shifted in their favor, and it was already over. Rose Lavelle pulled off a couple of stepovers and slotted a strike past Van Veenendaal in the 69th minute.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8ed7e641-d1c0-48e8-bb83-56c20ca9d7b1\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Megan Rapinoe</b>'s goal from the penalty spot in the final gave her the Golden Boot ahead of USA teammate <b>Alex Morgan</b>. Both players scored six goals and got three assists, but Rapinoe did so in fewer minutes. England's <b>Ellen White</b> came third with six goals, after having goals disallowed in the semi-final and third-place play-off.</p>\n    <p>Rapinoe also won the <b>Golden Ball</b> for the tournament's best player, with England full-back <b>Lucy Bronze</b> second and USA midfielder <b>Rose Lavelle</b> third.

In that final against Japan the Americans were already 4-0 up by the 16th minute, and that explosive final came after struggles early in the tournament. This iteration has been the opposite \u2013 the US have utterly bulldozed their way to the final but looked stymied by the Dutch for the better part of Sunday\u2019s proceedings.</p> \n<p>The USA\u2019s struggles are a testament to a Dutch side that rightfully earned their place in the final with quality players and smart tactics. Their coach, Sarina Wiegman, kept the Dutch in a mid-to-low block that stayed compact and limited space for the USA to attack in behind or on the wings. The USA played right into it by trying to score through brute force early on, even as Van Veenendaal was called upon to make at least two strong saves.</p> \n<p>The momentum had noticeably slipped for the Americans by the time half-time approached. That\u2019s when the Dutch got out on a quick counterattack and center-back Abby Dahlkemper, unable to toe-poke the ball away, shoved Lineth Beerensteyn, earning a yellow card.

      "bodyText": "It became clear after 13 minutes that this was going to be a different kind of game for the USA. The Netherlands, it turned out, were different from any team they had faced at this World Cup. But the US had something no other side in the tournament had: Megan Rapinoe, the biggest star of the World Cup, and the confidence she embodies. After steamrolling their way through the rest of the tournament and scoring within 12 minutes in every game, the mighty Americans had to wait an agonizing 61 minutes to score against a team that very much got their tactics right. Although the Dutch goalkeeper, Sari van Veenendaal, was called on to make a handful of saves, the Netherlands were more organized and gave the Americans less space than any other team in this World Cup. The Americans\u2019 tactics often looked stale \u2013 they tried their darnedest to come out as the aggressors, just as they have this entire tournament, by playing direct and looking to spring attackers in behind. But the final came down to the composure of the most unflappable player in the World Cup, the magnetic pink-haired Rapinoe. It could not have been more poetic and more fitting that, after weeks of discussion about Rapinoe \u2013 from the media who loved having someone interesting to write about, the other teams who feared or admired her, and even the president of the United States who was apparently annoyed by her \u2013 she would be the one to step up to the penalty spot and break the deadlock. After a video review Alex Morgan earned the penalty, challenging for a ball that the Dutch defender Stefanie van der Gragt put a high boot to and missed, catching Morgan. The cool-as-ice Rapinoe stepped up to the spot and hit her penalty with pace \u2013 it was comfortable and natural, much like Rapinoe has seemed to be throughout the grind of this World Cup. Once Rapinoe scored the USA\u2019s victory was not in doubt \u2013 that\u2019s just the way the US have looked when scoring first in this World Cup. The momentum had finally shifted in their favor, and it was already over. Rose Lavelle pulled off a couple of stepovers and slotted a strike past Van Veenendaal in the 69th minute. This had a very different feeling from the USA\u2019s World Cup victory four years ago. In that final against Japan the Americans were already 4-0 up by the 16th minute, and that explosive final came after struggles early in the tournament. This iteration has been the opposite \u2013 the US have utterly bulldozed their way to the final but looked stymied by the Dutch for the better part of Sunday\u2019s proceedings. The USA\u2019s struggles are a testament to a Dutch side that rightfully earned their place in the final with quality players and smart tactics. Their coach, Sarina Wiegman, kept the Dutch in a mid-to-low block that stayed compact and limited space for the USA to attack in behind or on the wings. The USA played right into it by trying to score through brute force early on, even as Van Veenendaal was called upon to make at least two strong saves. The momentum had noticeably slipped for the Americans by the time half-time approached. That\u2019s when the Dutch got out on a quick counterattack and center-back Abby Dahlkemper, unable to toe-poke the ball away, shoved Lineth Beerensteyn, earning a yellow card. Shortly after that Kelley O\u2019Hara and Lieke Martens clashed heads and O\u2019Hara had to be replaced by the surprise roster inclusion Ali Krieger. At about the time Becky Sauerbrunn, the USA\u2019s rock along the backline, went down with blood streaming from her face, it looked like the Americans might be in trouble. But what they have counted on throughout this World Cup, more than their quality, their athleticism or their experience, has been their mentality. Rapinoe, who at one point shook her fists at her teammates as if to say, \u201cLet\u2019s step it up!\u201d has embodied that mentality. The supreme confidence that some party-poopers labeled arrogance meant the US were never out of games here in France, even when the French arguably played better, the Spanish kicked the hell out of them or the Dutch choked off their service. Sauerbrunn praised her side\u2019s star player. \u201cEvery team would be very lucky to have Megan Rapinoe. She willingly takes on that pressure, when we need her she shows up. That\u2019s just a quality she has that is innate, you can\u2019t teach that. Whenever we call upon her, she very willingly steps up to that limelight and she owns it and she thrives in it.\u201d The momentum did not need to go in the USA\u2019s favor for just over an hour because the US are never out of games. They always keep the faith that the momentum will come back around. They knew a player such as Rapinoe can step up calmly and execute. They knew that no one has been better throughout this World Cup.

They explain how they have improved their own lives and others\u2019: from dealing with bullying at school, to upcycling clothes for the homeless and preserving Britain\u2019s beaches. Cameron Osburn, who was 17 years old when I spoke to him, was left on the subs bench at football because cerebral palsy meant he couldn\u2019t run as fast as other players, so founded his own football team for children with disabilities, Adversity United. Will Kilgannon, who was just 15, lost his father to prostate cancer, and has campaigned tirelessly to increase awareness of the condition. I also spoke to Amika George, then 19, at the forefront of the campaign against period poverty, and Maya Ghazal, also 19, a refugee from Syria who is now an advocate for refugee rights, while studying to become an aviation engineer. There\u2019s Zainab Gulbano, 17, who thought she\u2019d always be the class clown but now puts her energy into helping rebellious kids as a youth worker at her old school; and Amarni, 17, who stepped away from the fringes of gang violence and now inspires a group of other teens to focus on their love of music. They may not be on the stage at Glastonbury but they are the young people on our streets, on the bus, shuffling to school in their parkas or hoiked-up skirts, and they should make us proud. It became clear to me during these conversations that, very often, it is the right kind of support from someone who believes in them that can propel a teenager to do the right thing. We adults, whether parents, grandparents, carers or teaching staff, can fall into the trap of being too judgmental, forgetting that it\u2019s their \u201cjob\u201d to disagree with us and make our lives difficult, all part of the process of separating and growing up. Of course, as a parent I\u2019ve been judgmental myself. We believe that we always have the answers our young people seek but sometimes other young people can be the influence and inspiration they need. Adults tend to see this kind of peer influence as a bad thing, but it can be transformational if the ones they look up to are achieving something positive in the world. Their age means that teenagers are hopefully not yet world-weary or jaded by constant rejection. If they have had a vision for the change they want to see in their own lives, the community around them and the wider world, they are well placed to articulate it. We should listen. Lucy Gavaghan, who at 14 persuaded Tesco and other major supermarket chains to pledge not to sell eggs from caged hens, put it like this: \u201cThere must be something about being a teenager that makes me feel that this is a great point to look around and think, \u2018Is this the kind of world I want to grow up in?\u2019 I think my age helped me. Everything seems so clear to me.\u201d \u2022 Margaret Rooke is the author of You Can Change the World! Everyday Teen Heroes Making a Difference Everywhere",

The defense looked a little shaky. Goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher hadn\u2019t been on this stage before. Second-guessing Jill Ellis\u2019 tactics had replaced baseball as the national pastime. </p> \n  <p>Today? Questions answered. Ellis has gotten everything right. When Megan Rapinoe sat out, the US offense actually improved, though they may need Rapinoe\u2019s set-piece work today. The defense isn\u2019t invincible, but Crystal Dunn has grown steadier as the tournament has gone on, and Becky Sauerbrunn certainly won\u2019t be overawed by the occasion. In the semifinal, Naeher saved a rocket from Keira Walsh and saved (and, more importantly, smothered the rebound) a penalty. </p> \n  <p>The Netherlands don\u2019t have any specific weaknesses, but as far as they\u2019ve come over the years, this is a bridge too far. <br><br>(See next post for a rebuttal.) <br></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/06/dutch-netherlands-womens-world-cup-final-usa\">Flying Dutch take remarkable rise to the final frontier against USA</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-07T13:53:48.790Z\">at 2.53pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d21df538f08cf92bb76af2c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-07T13:31:47.587Z\">2.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble: Historic win or historic upset?</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The US women have gone on a remarkable run to get here.

You sometimes hear players say polite things like \u201cI\u2019m just going to take one game at a time\u201d but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. In my experience, before a final, you know that you\u2019re only one game away from reaching the absolute pinnacle of your sport. Everything that you have left inside you and everything you haven\u2019t even yet used is about to be put on display in that final match. You don\u2019t want to let this opportunity slip away. You get more excited; you have more nerves; you feel more pressure; you\u2019re finally in the place that you have wanted to be since forever.</p> \n   <p>I won three Olympic gold medals but, for me, the World Cup is the peak of football. We lost the final on penalties in 2011, and in 2015 there was a good chance that it wasn\u2019t going to happen for us again. That would have been harsh on players like Abby Wambach and Christie Rampone who were close to retiring and I knew, too, that I would not be satisfied with my career if I didn\u2019t hold the World Cup in my hands.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>You can read the full article below:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/06/players-tell-themselves-the-world-cup-final-is-just-another-game-theyre-wrong\">Players tell themselves the World Cup final is just another game.

      "bodyText": "The trophy is raised Let\u2019s not forget how difficult it was to get here. At times, they made it look easy. It\u2019s not. England were outstanding. France were very good. Spain were difficult to beat. Germany and Australia, both fine teams, didn\u2019t make it anywhere near the final. Thank you for following all the games here. Enjoy your celebrations. Silver Ball to Lucy Bronze, apparently. Best XI should include Julie Ertz as well as Lavelle. Fox hasn\u2019t mentioned it, but we\u2019ve just seen the Golden Glove awarded to the Netherlands\u2019 Sari van Veenendaal. After this game, few could argue. And the Bronze Ball goes to Rose Lavelle. The Silver Ball goes to some player Fox doesn\u2019t mention. The Golden Ball goes to Rapinoe. And on the global pay issue ... Caitlin Murray believes she hears chants of \u201cequal pay.\u201d Within US Soccer, that\u2019s difficult to define. The women are on salary. The men aren\u2019t. The women confine their player pool to the mid-30s -- the men use 50-60 players. This year and last, the US women will outearn the men. By a lot. And few would argue that, given the failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup. But World Cup prize money is skewed very heavily toward the men. Maybe that\u2019s one of the reasons for this? \u201cI don\u2019t know how to feel right now,\u201d says Megan Rapinoe. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d She then pays tribute to Rose Lavelle. What makes this team so great? \u201cWe\u2019re crazy!\u201d The person who really rose above the critics? It\u2019s Jill Ellis. USA\u2019s record It\u2019s not always easy. This one wasn\u2019t, even though they were clearly the best team in the tournament. They had to rally in the quarterfinals in 1999 and 2012. But they\u2019ve only finished out of the medals once -- the last major tournament, Rio 2016. Safe to say they\u2019ve exorcised those demons. Hamstring? What hamstring? Nice one here: More reaction ... Mary Waltz: \u201cTip of the cap to the Netherlands. They played a courageous game, their defensive stance succeeded in the first half, but the US side was simply too strong.\u201d Charles Antaki: \u201cWell, my slow train got me to Bristol in the end, where the wifi is fine. So half my experience of the Final has been patchy, slow and largely ineffective; the other half fast, reliable and successful. Hmm.\u201d Glad you made it. OB Jato: \u201cWhen USA celebrates a much-deserved successful World Cup defence at the end of the final, I\u2019m sure no one will have a problem with their celebrations this tine around. Live on legends, and keep being the best in the world!\u201d Abhijato Sensarma: \u201cAs this memorable tournament comes to a close, let\u2019s do an In Memoriam. For me, this World Cup will be remembered for - best quality of play, beautiful jerseys, VAR controversies, excessive celebrations, and exceptional dedication from all sides involved in playing this beautiful sport. Cheers!\u201d Lucy and Bob Duncan: \u201cThere is real beauty in this match. Women focused and at the top of their game and respecting one another\u2026. it is wonderful to watch individual athletes skilled beyond whatever \u201cnormal\u201d means. I cheer for each team, holding my breath that all players will leave the game knowing they\u2019ve done their best and leave the field uninjured!\u201d Game report Wow, we\u2019re quick. Brash but brilliant. They can attack in waves, from the Rapinoe-Morgan-Heath front line to Lavelle in midfield and back to overlapping backs. If they could give the Golden Ball to a unit, it should be given to the US midfield and defense, which has been stifling. The \u201cexpected goals\u201d stat may have favored France and England in those games, but that\u2019s misleading -- the USA had it in control most of the time. And today, despite strong Dutch resistance, the USA were a level above. Only strong goalkeeping kept it scoreless at the half. The US are a team worth celebrating. Enjoy. 90 min +2: We\u2019ll wrap up on the controversial penalty before giving the champions their due ... Refs tell me the call could NOT be playing the ball in a dangerous manner, which the rest of us call \u201cdangerous play\u201d and results in an INDIRECT free kick, because she made contact. I\u2019m getting plenty of email disagreeing with the call, even though the ref forum and 90% of tweets I see say it was a good call. Here\u2019s the winner, from Pete Edmunds: \u201cI heard an ex UK pro men\u2019s footballer on radio saying the acid test for a dive is - would the player have gone down if holding a baby. I think it\u2019s fair to say Morgan would have not fallen over with baby in arms. It was a lame dive. Game changer.\u201d I don\u2019t think Morgan was necessarily taking a dive, but I love that definition. I\u2019ve also seen people saying Morgan initiated the contact, but I\u2019m not sure that matters. We have five minutes of stoppage time for the Dutch to find a miracle. 89 min: This is correct ... But all these attacks are taking up time the Netherlands\u2019 desperately need in the other half of the field. 87 min: Here we go again -- the USA have a wealth of solid backup defenders as well as Lindsey Horan, and it\u2019s ... Carli Lloyd! I\u2019ve read the women\u2019s collective bargaining agreement. There\u2019s nothing in there that says she has to be in every game. She\u2019s been fine when she has played, but this still seems more ceremonial than situational. 85 min: But the USA are not in time-wasting mode. Tobin Heath again beats multiple defenders but can\u2019t get a shot away. Christen Press does, but it\u2019s straight at the keeper. Then Heath again, this time going from the midfield and not quite getting the shot away, this time in the middle of the area. 82 min: Not much going on now except Morgan shooting when everyone in the stadium knew it was offside but the assistant referee had to wait to put the flag up. I\u2019m waiting for someone to kill time on such a situation. 80 min: Spitse free kick chance is deflected at the wall, which would have left the keeper stranded. Ref didn\u2019t think it deflected, so it\u2019s a goal kick. 79 min: Press enters for Rapinoe, who now leads the Golden Boot race on goals-per-minute. Seems unfair after getting three goals from the spot, but she did take all three penalties very well, unlike ... well ... 77 min: And finally, Naeher has to make a save as Beerensteyn shoots from the edge of the area, but Krieger had effectively cut down the angle so it goes straight to the keeper. Now Naeher takes about 400 seconds with the ball. The goal was a beauty ... 76 min: CHANCE for Dunn, who makes a diagonal run with the ball and breaks ankles (basketball term for a fake that leaves a defender in the dust) to be at point-blank range. Saved. 74 min: USA have outshot the Netherlands 12-2. Better to be lucky than good, but it\u2019s best to be lucky AND good, which the USA are. Roughly 90% of my responses are going the other way. Some even calling for red, which is baffling. 73 min: The Dutch will go for it. Dekker is out. Van de Sanden is in. Classic attacker-for-defender swap. 72 min: It\u2019s all US right now. Morgan gets away but touches a little too far, and van Veenendaal bravely collects. 71 min: And Martens comes out. In comes Roord. Good chance for the USA that Heath squanders after finding space on the right and beating a defender. Spitse recovers to slide and block it. Dunn starts it with a fantastic tackle, Lavelle ends up with it, she jinks to her left and fires a left-footed blast into the corner. THAT was a brilliant game-winner (amazing comebacks notwithstanding). 68 min: Now the USA are countering, and we see why Lavelle was in. Van de Sanden, who plays her club soccer for Lyon, is warming up. Replay shows Miedema again beating four defenders but not shooting in time. 66 min: The Dutch are attacking. The US are defending. This will continue. 62 min: Morgan had absolutely no chance to turn that ball around and score when the penalty was given. Van der Gragt was trying for the ball. Even if you accept that the call was valid (which Twitter tells me it was, but I\u2019m hearing only from Americans), that is fortunate. That said -- you keep attacking and good things happen. Struck well as always. 60 min: It\u2019s a penalty, and the US women are the luckiest team on the face of the planet. Yellow to van der Gragt. 58 min: Morgan is down once again. The US fans and Aly Wagner want a penalty for a high boot, and VAR is checking. That would be harsh. Ridiculous, even. But the ref will take a look. 58 min: Sauerbrunn returns with a bandage as well as her usual headband. Forget Rapinoe\u2019s hair -- THAT is a fashion statement. And now she has to deal with a counterattack. Spitse ends up on the ground, and we\u2019re wondering why. 57 min: The Dutch try to go direct-ish to van de Donk, but it\u2019s too far. Mewis presses Groenen to win a US throw-in. The US pressure may end up playing a decisive role here. They\u2019ve rattled the Dutch multiple times now. 55 min: It\u2019s another head-to-head collision, this time with Sauerbrunn and van de Donk. It would be a shame if Sauerbrunn had to leave this game. After two incidents, and now some blood, she may have to. 54 min: Good fun from Morgan slipping between the center backs, and Dekker shields the ball from her before pinging it off her leg for a goal kick ... oh, wait, it\u2019s a late flag from the assistant referee. That could work at some point. Oh no. Becky Sauerbrunn is down. Again. And she\u2019s bleeding just above her eye. 52 min: Dunn, a fine NWSL attacker playing left back here, unleashes a shot wide. Michael Clark adds to the tactical advice: \u201cThough weaker, Holland is playing at the top of its form and could well steal this game. For the first half hour the American strategy seemed poor, and badly executed. Their passing was atrocious, and it seemed unlikely they could pry open Holland\u2019s fresh defense with long balls. US needs to build up through midfield with the aim of besieging Holland in their box.\u201d We should point out -- Alyssa Naeher has yet to make a save. 50 min: And again, the Netherlands weather the early storm and force USA to do what one of their legends suggests ... 48 min: As in the first couple of minutes of the first half, it\u2019s all in the Dutch half now. But they\u2019ll need to score. No way they can hang on for 120 minutes, especially after a long semifinal. Already hearing from Fox that the US staff believe the Dutch are tiring. 46 min: It\u2019s Rapinoe to Ertz at the near post, but Ertz is running too far outside that post and heads it wide. Krieger is indeed in for O\u2019Hara. 46 min: Alex Morgan races out left and beats Dekker, forcing the ball to be played out for a corner, and I have a funny feeling again ... Very quick Twitter highlights ... Yeah, but that\u2019s what Mick Shrimpton thought. We\u2019re back underway. The Netherlands produced a neat video, if it\u2019s a little deferential to today\u2019s opponent ... Speaking of subs ... Krieger is a veteran who spent a couple of years out of the picture before getting the call this year to jump back in and claim a World Cup roster spot. She may offer less going forward than O\u2019Hara but may be more solid on defense. The Horan discussion It\u2019s a tough question because someone would have to come out of the midfield. Lavelle has been a terrific playmaker. Mewis is a strong two-way player. Ertz is a reasonable pick for Golden Ball honors. One option would be to move Ertz to center back, where she used to play, but then she\u2019s not in the attack as often unless she leaves the back line exposed to counterattacks. My guess is that Horan comes in for Lavelle at some point. Jill Ellis would surely prefer to have the lead by then, and we\u2019d eventually see Ertz make it a five-player back line again. Can\u2019t get to all the email, but let\u2019s pick a few ... Clare Lawrence: \u201cMorgan on the other hand went down like an absolute sack of spuds which was disappointing. Oscars aren\u2019t on the line tonight.\u201d Didn\u2019t someone write a piece about the USWNT embracing villain status, including gamesmanship such as this? Ah, yes ... Alexander Sharkey informs me that a better term for \u201cwrestling move\u201d is \u201crugby tackle.\u201d Tribute to the US men\u2019s dominant sevens team? Scoreless but compelling. The Netherlands have created some danger, but the story of the game is at the other end ... Give me 2-3 minutes, and I\u2019ll be back to tackle the inbox. 45 min +3: The newfangled drop ball is placed at the feet of Heath, who waits, perhaps in the hope that the injured players are waved on. Maybe she should\u2019ve waited longer, because Miedema beats four defenders to get a cross in. We end up with a Dutch corner kick and a thrilling goalmouth scramble. 45 min +1: We\u2019ll have two minutes of stoppage time, but it\u2019ll be longer now that O\u2019Hara has gotten the worst of a head-to-head collision. Fox has declined to identify the Dutch player who\u2019s down. Oh, now they say it\u2019s Martens. 45 min: Morgan knocks into Groenen and is called for the foul. That one actually seems a little harsh, but it\u2019s right at midfield and shouldn\u2019t affect the outcome. 44 min: The Netherlands maintain possession and end up sending a speculative ball into the area, which Naeher easily nabs. The Dutch try to counter again with left-back Bloodworth racing up the right against Dunn, but she rushes things and sends a cross well out of play. 42 min: The Dutch free kick honors go to Spitse, whose kick is going nowhere near but grazes O\u2019Hara\u2019s head to set up a corner. 41 min: YELLOW CARD to US defender Abby Dahlkemper, who tripped Beerensteyn to stop a counter-attack just outside the area. US fans and commentators are still mad about a non-call just outside the area at the other end, when Rose Lavelle was fouled/tackled cleanly. Free kick now ... 40 min: A huge save from a 20-yard blast from Morgan to the Netherlands\u2019 near post. The Dutch keeper has been terrific in the last five minutes. The Netherlands counter. A player goes down, but there\u2019s nothing in it. And the USA go the other way to Rapinoe, who crosses ... 40 min: It\u2019s only a matter of time for a US goal if the Netherlands keep allowing crosses, this one from Kelley O\u2019Hara overlapping on the right as she so often does. 38 min: Two big saves and we see the danger Rapinoe poses with crosses. Two low ones to Morgan and Mewis, and van Veenendaal has to stop the danger each time. USA have outpassed the Netherlands 152-85, say those who count such things and put graphics on the screen. 37 min: Long diagonal cross to Morgan, who is knocked down in the area. It\u2019s a nudge, says Fox Sports pundit Aly Wagner. It\u2019s close to shoulder to shoulder, I say. VAR agrees with at least one of us, and it\u2019s a corner. 36 min: US attackers really pressing the Dutch defense now. When I think Rapinoe, I think skill rather than speed. But she did outrun a defender earlier. She\u2019s not getting as many touches today as she has, though. And as I\u2019ve said many times ... well, you know what I\u2019m going to say about getting the ball to Heath. Dahlkemper is nearly dispossessed in her own area. Nervy stuff here. 33 min: Another US corner. Here was the danger from the last one -- some disagreement over whether Lavelle or Ertz had the shot, but another angle would surely clear it up. This corner is cleared more cleanly and quickly upfield, and Naeher ends up playing the ball 40 yards from her line to help the US defence maintain possession. (Yes, defence. Happy now?) 32 min: Said it before \u2013 Tobin Heath on the right is more consistently dangerous than Megan Rapinoe on the left. Heath beats Bloodworth cleanly and crosses, but it doesn\u2019t connect. K\u00e1ri Tulinius writes: \u201cWith the possible exception of last year\u2019s men\u2019s World Cup final, the 2011 final between the US and Japan is the best final this century. It featured a great US team playing excellent football and an underrated Japan reaching a new level. It made for a gripping spectacle with four lovely goals. I hope today\u2019s game comes close.\u201d That was indeed a brilliant game. Tulinius follows up: \u201cLast year\u2019s final between France and Croatia felt like favorite vs underdog game. So did 2011\u2019s final between the US and Japan. Those are the two best finals this century, which augurs well for today.\u201d 29 min: This could be terrible for the US. Becky Sauerbrunn collides with a Dutch player and is down. Sauerbrunn has been the USA\u2019s rock on defense for so long. Correction: The through ball from the Netherlands was for Beerensteyn. It happened quickly. After 90 seconds or so, Sauerbrunn is ready to return. 28 min: Big save through traffic on a Lavelle shot from 15 yards out. The rebound goes way high. 27 min: Another corner kick for the USA, and I just have a funny feeling about this one ... 26 min: CHANCE ... a Dutch through-ball splits the US center-backs, and Naeher has to race outside her area to blast the ball away with Miedema bearing down on her. Delicately poised game at the moment. 25 min: A cross from Dunn to Mewis gives Van Veenendaal a difficult catch as she\u2019s backtracking. Neil Truby asks what it means to say, as I did earlier, that Mewis responds with a takedown. Basically, a wrestling move. But I should clarify that a few seconds had elapsed after Rapinoe cried foul. Still, between that and the Ertz foot stomp, you wonder if the USA are playing by an ice hockey code of retaliation today. 22 min: Now the USA look more deliberate, passing around at the back. Hubert O\u2019Hearn with an interesting point: \u201cWhat I\u2019m going to suggest is by no means insulting, but this feels more like an FA Cup than a World Cup. You know, some hulking monster of a Man City, or Chelsea in their pomp, facing the gutsy team from mid-table or the Championship that went on a magical run. It\u2019s actually rather charming \u2013 can\u2019t remember the last time a World Cup Final felt so Favourite v. Underdog.\u201d Perhaps, but the Netherlands have weathered the first 22 minutes far better than the more heralded teams from France and England. 20 min: The USA aren\u2019t necessarily playing direct as such, but when Tobin Heath has space on the right, why not play it into her path? The ball sails long, though. David Meleshko has an answer for our friend in Argentina: \u201cThe answer to that, as to so many of life\u2019s questions, is to find a pub.\u201d When we hit a lull (we haven\u2019t yet), please check out our photos of players behind the scenes. 18 min: Rapinoe is dispossessed and immediately wants a foul. The replay shows an absolutely legal shoulder-to-shoulder challenge. Mewis responds with a takedown. 17 min: Nearly spoke too soon. A long ball goes to Rapinoe, who outruns her defender. That\u2019s not a good sign for the Dutch. The ball is deflected for a corner. The ball pings around in traffic. Lavelle gets it and tries to cross, but the Dutch keeper snares it. 16 min: Dahlkemper plays a long ball, but van Veenendaal collects. And the Dutch have officially made it past the 15-minute mark. No \u201cscore and park the bus\u201d this early in the game for the US. 14 min: The USA still look like they\u2019re one pass away from unlocking the defense. O\u2019Hara gives the ball back with an illegal throw-in, a rare lapse at this level, but the Dutch immediately give it back with a poor touch. Another opinion on the yellow card to Spitse: 12 min: Alyssa Naeher gets a touch, racing out to grab a through ball near the top of her box. Or area. 11 min: Tobin Heath takes the free kick from the right flank. It goes into a crowd but not really near anyone. Foul on Julie Ertz, who goes in with studs up, puts her foot down to avoid a yellow of her own, then steps on Bloodworth\u2019s foot anyway. Ouch. 10 min: The US defenders pad their passing stats near midfield, helped by the Netherlands\u2019 unwillingness to press. So maybe they are a counterattacking team today. Lavelle draws a foul, and it\u2019s a YELLOW CARD to Spitse. Not sure about that. Late, but ... 8 min: The Netherlands are halfway to surviving the first 15 minutes, which most US opponents do not. An American in a hostel in Argentina wants to know how to watch the game. My guess would be not to be in a hostel in Argentina, but if anyone knows ... 6 min: The Netherlands may not be a counterattacking team by design, but given the propensity of the USA to play something akin to a 2-3-5 formation from a century ago, they\u2019re finding plenty of space when they gain possession. Something to watch. 4 min: The Dutch cross midfield. Alex Morgan, as usual, is on the ground -- this time after a clean collision. Logically, I agree, but I had to pass American college entrance exams somehow. 2 min: USA have not had a serious chance yet. But the ball is staying on one side of the field. Kickoff: Also, meet our refs. Final pregame reading ... Jill Ellis is closer to her childhood home than the players she\u2019s coaching ... Mary Waltz writes: \u201cI think the duel title match situation is more of a unintentional foul up rather then intentional sexism. Actually, the Men\u2019s team has suffered in terms of press attention. And since they are struggling to overcome their world cup exclusion they could have used the exclusive positive press of a Gold Cup final.\u201d True. The US men have been punching bags for a good 20 months or so since the qualifying disaster. Charles Antaki: \u201cI\u2019m not in Indonesia, but their Wifi may be better than the one in the train I\u2019m on, making its not-especially-fast way to Bristol via Cheltenham Spa and the like. Has anyone done a comparison of Indonesian and British train Wifi, especially with regards to following World Cup Finals?\u201d I\u2019ll ask. Answer at halftime? Here we go ... Festivities now ... ... along with a quick run to the fridge and restroom (sorry, both US words) before kickoff. Golden Ball race Fox is hyping Megan Rapinoe\u2019s chances of winning the Golden Boot/Golden Ball double. The first would require her to outscore Alex Morgan by at least one goal today. The second would surely require a monster game today. She could always have a massive final, though. The common language A fun note here the Dutch keeper/captain in English ... If you\u2019ve seen any US tweets in Dutch, please let me know. Then please translate them. Fifteen minutes to go: Hello all Happy to be joined today by a global audience, which I\u2019m told includes a sizable number of people from Indonesia. Thank you for spending your evening with us. And speaking of the global reach today ... Do you realize how difficult it is for me to give plural verbs? \u201cThe USA are ...\u201d and so forth? I\u2019m just waiting for my fellow referees to yell at me when I slip up and say \u201cpenalty box\u201d or something other than \u201ckicks from the mark\u201d should the game (er, match) go that far. Incidentally, \u201csoccer\u201d is an English word. So there. Dutch coach\u2019s US ties Anson Dorrance coached the US women to the Fifa World Championship for Women\u2019s Football for the M&amp;M\u2019s Cup. That tournament, like the first Super Bowl, was retroactively named. It\u2019s now the 1991 World Cup. Dorrance has coached for decades at the University of North Carolina, which continues to provide players for the USA \u2013 Tobin Heath, Crystal Dunn, Ashlyn Harris, Allie Long and Jessica McDonald. His Tar Heel teams have also included players on other World Cup teams, including England\u2019s Lucy Bronze. And he once coached a Dutch player named Sarina Wiegman. Today, Wiegman will coach the Netherlands against Heath, Dunn and company. Historical accomplishment or complete mess? Has any other country seen its women\u2019s and men\u2019s teams defend two international titles on the same day? That\u2019s the unintended consequence of a controversial oversight in which the Women\u2019s World Cup leads off a tripleheader of international finals that also includes the men\u2019s Copa America and the men\u2019s Gold Cup. Yes, the US men are the defending champion of the Gold Cup, the Concacaf championship that manages the rare feat of being simultaneously lucrative and barely relevant. The crowds are often substantial -- 63,032 showed up to see the USA beat Jamaica in the 2017 final, and 70,788 fans turned up in Houston to see a quarterfinal doubleheader this year in which Mexico got past Costa Rica on penalties. Mexico also needed extra time to get past Haiti in the semifinal, but they\u2019re the oddsmakers\u2019 favorites against a US team that looked less than impressive in beating Curacao. Yes, Curacao. The Gold Cup was once a springboard to the Confederations Cup, where the US men achieved their most stunning victory since ... maybe 1950? On goals by Clint Dempsey and Jozy Altidore, the USA ended Spain\u2019s 35-game unbeaten streak in 2009. But the prevailing narrative in the US media is that this juxtaposition of games shows FIFA\u2019s callous disregard for the women\u2019s game. The women should have one day to themselves, the argument goes. We shouldn\u2019t be talking men\u2019s soccer today. And as strange as it seems to those of us immersed in this World Cup, Google trends show the Gold Cup holding its own in terms of interest. TV ratings tell a different story, even with the women\u2019s games taking place during the workday due to the time difference between the USA and France. Perhaps the biggest problem is that the schedule has ramped up the Great Gender War of 2019. Social media is full of viral tweets on both sides of the argument, it\u2019s unlikely either side is going to be satisfied. So some US fans will make the best of the situation and watch both. Some won\u2019t. Fox informs us that they\u2019ll have a preview of the new film Mulan at halftime. The US broadcasters have had the occasional gaffe -- in yesterday\u2019s game, the broadcast completely missed the fact that a referee\u2019s whistle had rendered a save irrelevant -- but the tactical analysts, relying in part on English stars Eni Aluko and Kelly Smith, has been superb. Once again, Jill Ellis omits one of the most highly regarded players in the world (Lindsey Horan). Repeating these lineups in plain text: USA: Naeher / Dunn, Sauerbrunn, Dahlkemper, O\u2019Hara / Lavelle, Ertz, Mewis / Rapinoe, Morgan, Heath Netherlands: van Veenendaal / Bloodworth, van der Gragt, Dekker, van Lunteren / Spitse, van de Donk, Groenen / Martens, Miedema, Beerensteyn The lone change for the Netherlands is Dekker for van Dongen at the back. Why the Netherlands can pull this off ... No pressure, no problems. Despite their shock win in Euro 2017, the culmination of a slow and steady rise after years in the women\u2019s soccer wilderness, the Netherlands are underdogs here. They\u2019re also exceptionally talented. They have six players in The Guardian\u2019s list of the top 100 women\u2019s footballers. Barcelona forward Lieke Martens ranked ninth, one place ahead of fellow left-winger Megan Rapinoe. Then there\u2019s fellow attacker Vivianne Miedema (Arsenal), midfielder Dani\u00eblle van de Donk (Arsenal), forward Shanice van de Sanden (Lyon), midfielder Jackie Groenen (Frankfurt) and midfielder Sherida Spitse (V\u00e5lerenga). And they\u2019re deep. Van de Sanden came off the bench in the semifinal against Sweden, replacing phenom Lineth Beerensteyn. The defense may not have the same star power, but they\u2019ve held Italy and Sweden scoreless. Sweden showed in yesterday\u2019s third-place game that they\u2019re not easily contained. (See previous post for a rebuttal.) Why the Netherlands have no chance ... The US women faced plenty of questions coming into this tournament. The defense looked a little shaky. Goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher hadn\u2019t been on this stage before. Second-guessing Jill Ellis\u2019 tactics had replaced baseball as the national pastime. Today? Questions answered. Ellis has gotten everything right. When Megan Rapinoe sat out, the US offense actually improved, though they may need Rapinoe\u2019s set-piece work today. The defense isn\u2019t invincible, but Crystal Dunn has grown steadier as the tournament has gone on, and Becky Sauerbrunn certainly won\u2019t be overawed by the occasion. In the semifinal, Naeher saved a rocket from Keira Walsh and saved (and, more importantly, smothered the rebound) a penalty. The Netherlands don\u2019t have any specific weaknesses, but as far as they\u2019ve come over the years, this is a bridge too far. (See next post for a rebuttal.) The US women have gone on a remarkable run to get here. Through the knockout rounds against Spain, France and England (all 2-1 decisions), the games have been increasingly breathtaking. Oddsmakers would say today will not continue the trend. The Netherlands advanced past a fading Japanese team, an overachieving Italian team and a strangely toothless Swedish team. They may also be exhausted from the last of those games. Also, the US women have the benefit of being ... the US women. The Americans have already won this Cup three times, and they can take a two-Cup lead on Germany with a win today. We\u2019ve already seen a few games in France in which the opponents are rattled in the first 15 minutes, while the free-wheeling Americans revel in their ability to shrug off the pressure of expectations. But while the Netherlands have neither the history nor the iron-sharpening run to make it here, they have plenty of talent and the confidence of recent successes, especially the Euro 2017 championship. The next couple of posts will explain why this will or will not be a rout ... Beau will be here shortly. In the meantime, here\u2019s Hope Solo on what it\u2019s like to play in a World Cup final: The World Cup final is not just another game. You sometimes hear players say polite things like \u201cI\u2019m just going to take one game at a time\u201d but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. In my experience, before a final, you know that you\u2019re only one game away from reaching the absolute pinnacle of your sport. Everything that you have left inside you and everything you haven\u2019t even yet used is about to be put on display in that final match. You don\u2019t want to let this opportunity slip away. You get more excited; you have more nerves; you feel more pressure; you\u2019re finally in the place that you have wanted to be since forever. I won three Olympic gold medals but, for me, the World Cup is the peak of football. We lost the final on penalties in 2011, and in 2015 there was a good chance that it wasn\u2019t going to happen for us again. That would have been harsh on players like Abby Wambach and Christie Rampone who were close to retiring and I knew, too, that I would not be satisfied with my career if I didn\u2019t hold the World Cup in my hands.

      "bodyText": "The Crown Prosecution Service and police are requesting far too much \u2013 and often irrelevant \u2013 personal material in controversial \u201cdigital consent forms\u201d given to those reporting rapes, according to Vera Baird QC, the new victims\u2019 commissioner. Complainants are not being \u201cunreasonable\u201d if they resist intrusive demands that breach their privacy, the former Labour MP and solicitor general said. The police have threatened to drop investigations if complainants do not cooperate with such requests. In some cases there has been a \u201cwholly disproportionate\u201d insistence on handing over extensive private details even when a sexual assault involved an attack by a complete stranger, Baird confirmed. The row over consent forms comes as the criminal justice system is struggling to cope with the volume of evidence generated by mobile phones and digital technology. There has been a 173% rise over the past four years in the number of rapes reported to police in England and Wales while the number of cases going to court has fallen by 44%.

In investigations, the CPS will come back to the police after receiving a file and say they \u201cwant all the digital download\u201d. In one \u201chorror story\u201d she recalled from the north-east, a young woman was accused of being a liar during a sexual exploitation trial because lawyers had found a letter she wrote when she was a pupil in which she forged her mother\u2019s signature to get a day off school. Baird said she was encouraged by approaches from technology companies offering less intrusive versions of digital downloads. \u201cI have had two or three suppliers say you can choose what to download and \u2026 use technology more sensitively.

Baird is interested in the cycle of violence through which victims who endure sustained provocation can be transformed into assailants.

      "bodyText": "Police attempts to tackle violent crime have brought about a sharp rise in the use of stop and search powers in some of England\u2019s major forces, Guardian analysis reveals. In findings that critics have described as deeply worrying, data from eight of the country\u2019s biggest forces shows the scale of the use of stop and search, which more than doubled from 15,557 instances in March 2017 to 33,022 in March 2019. In 2018, eight major forces recorded 214,240 stop and searches, a rise from 178,318 in 2017. The Metropolitan police, Greater Manchester and the West Midlands police were behind the surge. Critics say stop-and-search powers disproportionately target black people and undermine community relations. The home secretary, Sajid Javid, enhanced section 60 powers in March this year, giving police officers more scope to stop and search people without reasonable suspicion in an attempt to combat knife crime. The frontrunner for the Conservative leadership, Boris Johnson, has repeatedly pledged to boost police powers to execute stop and searches in an effort to beat knife crime. He told a hustings event last month: \u201cIt\u2019s about giving police the political cover and support they need to do stop and search and to come down hard on those carrying knives,\u201d he said.

The MP said rising use of stop and search would further increase tensions in our society and \u201cexacerbate the crisis at a time of unprecedented division\u201d.

This is undoubtedly supported by public mandate in the main.\u201d Hanstock said they were evaluating the impact of an increased use of section 60 search powers. The enhanced powers, which the Home Office announced on 31 March, reduced the authorisation required for a section 60 from senior officer to inspector. A lesser degree of certainty was required by the police. The Guardian sent a freedom of information request to eight of the biggest police forces in England: Greater Manchester, the Metropolitan police, Merseyside, Northumbria, Devon and Cornwall, Thames Valley, West Midlands and West Yorkshire. Greater Manchester police have reported a rise in the use of stop and search from 2,852 cases in 2017 to 4,831 in 2019. The Met had a rise from 136,647 to 180,991 over the same period. John Sutherland, a retired borough commander who worked for the Met for more than 25 years, said the debate around stop and search was often reduced to the binary, with people thinking it was either the solution to everything or the route of all evil. \u201cIt has become increasingly difficult to have nuanced, intelligent conversation between those positions, and neither is correct \u2026 It has to be more than a binary debate,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cThe rise in use in itself is not bad, but it must be used appropriately. We must get beyond the binary \u2026 We don\u2019t have enough police officers out there and have not used stop and search adequately or sufficiently. And that has been significantly because of the politicisation of the power. \u201cFrom both sides of the political spectrum, senior politicians are guilty of politicising an operational power and with significantly damaging consequences.\u201d A Home Office spokesperson said stop and search was an important tool in disrupting crime. \u201cHowever, nobody should be stopped based on their race or ethnicity, and forces must ensure that officers use these intrusive powers in a way that is fair, lawful and effective.\u201d",

Too many useful services, such as children\u2019s centres, have been lost \u2013 despite recent confirmation of how Sure Start improved the health of families, and thus benefited the NHS. People need decent homes; opportunities to build their skills and confidence, so as to find work or other meaningful activity; places to meet their neighbours; arts and culture; support to learn how to manage their health; outdoor spaces and managed facilities to exercise and relax. More vulnerable groups need support such as youth services, dementia cafes, parenting support, carer respite, as well as advice and information. These services and activities are (or were once) paid for by local councils, and often led and provided by the local voluntary, community and social enterprise (VCSE) sector.

      "bodyText": "Sam Moore was one of the finest lecturers I came across in a 45-year period in British universities. He entertained a class of postgraduate students on Friday afternoons, 1969-70, on the MA (Econ) degree at Manchester University, teaching the then new course of computing. Atlas autocode was the programming language and he taught us many of the tricks of the trade, accessing the university\u2019s monster mainframe machine via flexowriter and paper tapes or, if you were lucky, punched paper cards. Lectures were lightened by his anecdotes and classes often adjourned to the nearby College Arms. Sam later rose through the ranks to become vice-chancellor of the university but he will be better remembered by the Dover Street class of 1970 for his teaching, lecturing and beer-drinking skills.",

Back in the real world, I would invite opponents of grammar schools to solve the \u201ctriple science conundrum\u201d. The headteacher of a comprehensive school considers the small cohort taking GCSE chemistry: the results are not sparkling, the lab is expensive to maintain and it is impossible to find a subject-specialist teacher. The solution to these challenges is to scrap the subject. The same goes for physics, additional maths, modern foreign languages and graded music exams \u2013 any subject, in fact, which requires additional resources from the school and a modicum of self-discipline from the pupils. Meanwhile, a couple of miles away, the headteacher of the neighbouring school is making exactly the same decisions. As a result, in large areas of the country \u2013 broadly speaking, poorer and more northern areas \u2013 there is a greatly restricted curriculum. The grammar-school system may be far from perfect, but it would help to provide the specialists we need, and to counterbalance the distorted power of the public schools in politics.<br><strong>Dr Mark Ellis</strong><br><em>Huddersfield, West Yorkshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Michael Pyke reports a slight fall in the percentage of privately educated pupils since 1966, but I wonder exactly which pupils were included in the figure of 7.1% in 1966? In that year I was approaching the end of my time as a pupil in a direct-grant grammar school, which was funded partly by the state/LEA and partly by fees, which in the following year were just over \u00a3100 pa. It meant that boys like me from lower middle-class and working-class families could attend, although when I went off to play cricket at the \u201creal\u201d public schools, the differences were readily apparent. By the mid-1970s I was teaching in a comprehensive school while my alma mater like many other direct-grant grammar schools, had gone fully independent. Their fees are now \u00a312,000+ pa. It is interesting that the sudden increase in independent schools at that time was brought about by a Labour government.<br><strong>Dr Dave Allen</strong><br><em>Portsmouth</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/15/share-your-best-photographs-of-the-week-with-us\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Click here</em></strong></a><strong><em> to upload it and we\u2019ll publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition</em></strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "In an ideal world, state schools should be generously funded so that all pupils can achieve their potential, find meaningful work and lead fulfilling lives (Letters, 3 July). Back in the real world, I would invite opponents of grammar schools to solve the \u201ctriple science conundrum\u201d. The headteacher of a comprehensive school considers the small cohort taking GCSE chemistry: the results are not sparkling, the lab is expensive to maintain and it is impossible to find a subject-specialist teacher. The solution to these challenges is to scrap the subject. The same goes for physics, additional maths, modern foreign languages and graded music exams \u2013 any subject, in fact, which requires additional resources from the school and a modicum of self-discipline from the pupils. Meanwhile, a couple of miles away, the headteacher of the neighbouring school is making exactly the same decisions. As a result, in large areas of the country \u2013 broadly speaking, poorer and more northern areas \u2013 there is a greatly restricted curriculum. The grammar-school system may be far from perfect, but it would help to provide the specialists we need, and to counterbalance the distorted power of the public schools in politics. Dr Mark Ellis Huddersfield, West Yorkshire \u2022 Michael Pyke reports a slight fall in the percentage of privately educated pupils since 1966, but I wonder exactly which pupils were included in the figure of 7.1% in 1966? In that year I was approaching the end of my time as a pupil in a direct-grant grammar school, which was funded partly by the state/LEA and partly by fees, which in the following year were just over \u00a3100 pa. It meant that boys like me from lower middle-class and working-class families could attend, although when I went off to play cricket at the \u201creal\u201d public schools, the differences were readily apparent. By the mid-1970s I was teaching in a comprehensive school while my alma mater like many other direct-grant grammar schools, had gone fully independent. Their fees are now \u00a312,000+ pa. It is interesting that the sudden increase in independent schools at that time was brought about by a Labour government.

I think the slope here works really well for us and it was nice to be able to attack the stumps. Megan Schutt was absolutely brilliant at the other end.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d2219468f0845f89e3085b4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-07T16:10:13.528Z\">5.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Here\u2019s the Australian captain Meg Lanning</strong></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very pleased with that performance. Ellyse Perry really showed the way and it\u2019s nice to get the job done. She and Megan Schutt are great \u2013 they take wickets up front and can keep it economical as well. They\u2019ve got great variety. </p> <p>\u201cWe got ourselves into a position to probably get 300, but England adjusted their bowling through the innings and hit the wicket a bit more. That slowed us down a bit. We didn\u2019t expect England to be 18 for five. Our opening bowlers put them under a lot of pressure and didn\u2019t give them many balls to hit.</p> <p>\u201cI think the series has been a lot closer than the score suggests. The first game in particular was very close, and England always come hard at us. We expect the same in the Test match.\u201d<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d2217e68f08cf92bb76b15d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-07T16:06:57.023Z\">5.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The England captain Heather Knight speaks</strong></p> <p>\u201cNot good enough. It\u2019s very tough to take. I thought Australia bowled very well and came at us hard, and we didn\u2019t have an answer to that. We can\u2019t feel sorry for ourselves; we need to prepare for that Test match and try to restart the series. We need to have some honest conversations and work out what\u2019s gone wrong. At the moment, I\u2019m not too sure. Credit to Australia \u2013 they were too good for us.</p> <p>\u201cI thought our bowlers were outstanding; I can\u2019t fault them at all. We thought it was a chaseable target. But Ellyse Perry bowled brilliantly. She moved the ball, attacking the pads and the outside edge. We competed for a long time in the first two games and could have won them. In many ways they are more frustrating than today. I think a change of format will be good for us.

How is the wicket playing? Any worries in it for the the English batters do you think? Perry has been able to get wickets on some benign surfaces before this.\u201d</p> <p>But in women\u2019s 50-over cricket we don\u2019t see a lot of big run chases. The batting revolution is ongoing. It\u2019s not so much about bowlers doing anything unplayable out of the surface, it\u2019s about being disciplined with where they bowl. Then it\u2019s on the batters to keep up with the rate without making a mistake. Usually those mistakes will come. <br></p> <p>England\u2019s biggest scores batting second are 272 (which they lost), 256 (which they lost) and 246 (which they lost).

Then the rest of the order was just able to tot up some contributions and push that score up to something imposing.

She\u2019s struck on the pad and is wandering away to square leg casually, then hears the cheer from England and whips her head around to stare at the umpire in disbelief. That was going down leg, wasn\u2019t it? On first glance. Bolton is walking off, but the replay tends to confirm that suspicion. Maybe it could have grazed leg stump? But there was a fair bit of angle from around the wicket, to the left-hander, and I don\u2019t think it was straightening or swinging in.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dca07f60d5ddbccee5e2399ec1cd07078707a8b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dca07f60d5ddbccee5e2399ec1cd07078707a8b1/0_0_3132_2384/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anya Shrubsole celebrates taking the wicket of Nicole Bolton for four.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"761\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anya Shrubsole celebrates taking the wicket of Nicole Bolton for four.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Browne/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-07T10:37:20.993Z\">at 11.37am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d21c7858f08d0b6ca52ba21\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-07T10:22:34.217Z\">11.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>6th over: Australia 21-0 (Healy 16, Bolton 4)</strong> Healy is playing more shots than Bolton but not getting many more runs for them.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for today\u2019s blog. I\u2019ll leave you with Raf Nicholson\u2019s report from Canterbury, where Australia moved closer to retaining the Ashes after humiliating England by 194 runs. Thanks for your company; bye. The Player of the Match is the exceedingly modest Ellyse Perry \u201cI guess it was my day today, which is really nice, but it\u2019s equally pleasing to win all three ODIs and finish this bit of the series as well as we did. I think the slope here works really well for us and it was nice to be able to attack the stumps. Megan Schutt was absolutely brilliant at the other end.\u201d Here\u2019s the Australian captain Meg Lanning \u201cI\u2019m very pleased with that performance. Ellyse Perry really showed the way and it\u2019s nice to get the job done. She and Megan Schutt are great \u2013 they take wickets up front and can keep it economical as well. They\u2019ve got great variety. \u201cWe got ourselves into a position to probably get 300, but England adjusted their bowling through the innings and hit the wicket a bit more. That slowed us down a bit. We didn\u2019t expect England to be 18 for five. Our opening bowlers put them under a lot of pressure and didn\u2019t give them many balls to hit. \u201cI think the series has been a lot closer than the score suggests. The first game in particular was very close, and England always come hard at us. We expect the same in the Test match.\u201d The England captain Heather Knight speaks \u201cNot good enough. It\u2019s very tough to take. I thought Australia bowled very well and came at us hard, and we didn\u2019t have an answer to that. We can\u2019t feel sorry for ourselves; we need to prepare for that Test match and try to restart the series. We need to have some honest conversations and work out what\u2019s gone wrong. At the moment, I\u2019m not too sure. Credit to Australia \u2013 they were too good for us. \u201cI thought our bowlers were outstanding; I can\u2019t fault them at all. We thought it was a chaseable target. But Ellyse Perry bowled brilliantly. She moved the ball, attacking the pads and the outside edge. We competed for a long time in the first two games and could have won them. In many ways they are more frustrating than today. I think a change of format will be good for us. But we have to play better as a top order.\u201d If Australia draw or win the Test at Taunton, starting on 18 July, they will retain the Ashes with three T20s to spare. If you\u2019re into association football, it\u2019s half-time in the World Cup final: USA 0-0 Netherlands. Australia take a 6-0 Ashes lead That was a brutal shellacking. Ellyse Perry took a shortcut through the England top order during a majestic new-ball spell, and returned later in the innings to finish with seven for 22. Absurd as it sounds, England did quite well to reach 75, having been 21 for six and 45 for eight. WICKET! England 75 all out (Marsh LBW b Jonassen 21) It\u2019s all over. Marsh misses a sweep and is plumb LBW to Jonassen. England have been dismissed for their lowest score in an ODI against Australia. 32nd over: England 74-9 (Marsh 21, Cross 8) Cross survives a biggish LBW appeal from Kimmince, who has started with consecutive maidens. That looked very close. 31st over: England 74-9 (Marsh 21, Cross 8) Cross brings up England\u2019s first fifty partnership of the day. Fifty balls, that is. It\u2019s not often that the tenth-wicket stand is the longest of the innings. It should have ended at 53 balls, but Jonassen dropped a tricky return chance offered by Cross. 30th over: England 73-9 (Marsh 21, Cross 7) Delissa Kimmince, who won the 2nd ODI at Leicester with her maiden five-for, comes into the attack. Marsh survives an appeal for caught behind after missing a cut, and it\u2019s a maiden. 29th over: England 73-9 (Marsh 21, Cross 7) Cross pings Schutt through midwicket for four - the first boundary of her burgeoning international career, in fact. She looks a better player than her modest record, and her position in the batting order, would suggest. 28th over: England 69-9 (Marsh 21, Cross 3) Jess Jonassen replaces Ashleigh Gardner and almost skids an arm ball straight through Marsh to finish the match. Marsh just managed to get some bat on it at the last minute. 27th over: England 67-9 (Marsh 19, Cross 3) Cross shovels Schutt behind square for a single. England need 13 more to avoid their lowest ODI score against Australia. 26th over: England 64-9 (Marsh 17, Cross 2) Cross survives an LBW appeal after missing a heave across the line at Gardner. I think it pitched outside leg stump. 25th over: England 64-9 (Marsh 17, Cross 2) On another day, Megan Schutt\u2019s figures would be outstanding. They are tarnished slightly when the determined Marsh steers her for four, but she\u2019ll still be very happy with 7-1-14-2. \u201cFunny thing about the English dismissals is that they didn\u2019t get out to unplayable deliveries and neither were they especially rash shots,\u201d says Avitaj Mitra. \u201cI don\u2019t know.. they look to be really innocuous ways to get out. The pitch clearly has no real demons, so any theories to explain the absurd scoreline?\u201d I have two: pressure (micro) and pressure (macro). 24th over: England 59-9 (Marsh 13, Cross 1) Two from Gardner\u2019s fourth over. England need 211 fro- oh what\u2019s the point. 23rd over: England 57-9 (Marsh 12, Cross 0) The new batter is Kate Cross, whose ODI average (4.67) is higher than her highest score (4). She plays out the remainder of the over to deny Perry an eighth wicket. She has to settle for the best figures by an Australian in an ODI: 10-4-22-7. And they still don\u2019t flatter her! There\u2019s one of them! Perry gets her seventh wicket, with Ecclestone driving straight to mid-off. This is verging on the surreal: England are 57 for nine. 22nd over: England 57-8 (Marsh 12, Ecclestone 0) Marsh slog-sweeps Gardner for four to become the third batter, after Wilson and Shrubsole, to reach double figures. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Pete Salmon. \u201cJust noticed there has never been an 8-for in women\u2019s ODIs...\u201d She needs two wickets in this next over to do it. 21st over: England 53-8 (Marsh 8, Ecclestone 0) Ecclestone sensibly plays out a maiden from Perry, who has one over remaining. \u201cThe team appears to have gone backwards ever since going fully pro,\u201d says Tim. \u201cWhat are the coaches doing for their money?\u201d Not much. Winning a World Cup, reaching a World T20 final. There is a sense of inertia, I agree, but I suspect the biggest problem is that Australia are just too good. England are probably the best of the rest. 20th over: England 53-8 (Marsh 8, Ecclestone 0) Marsh slog-sweeps Gardner for four, aided by a misfield from Schutt that elicits one of the biggest cheers of the day. An expert back cut brings Marsh four more later in the over - and takes England past their lowest-ever ODI score. \u201cAn early end to the OBO lies ahead, Mr Smyth!\u201d says Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cWhat\u2019s your plans for the rest of the day?\u201d I\u2019ll be covering the Copa America final between Brazil and Peru, which might last longer than England\u2019s innings. 19th over: England 45-8 (Marsh 0, Ecclestone 0) That wicket gives Perry career-best figures of six for 22. It\u2019s been a masterclass in new-ball bowling. A sadistic bowling change from Meg Lanning, who brings back Ellyse Perry to finish England off. And on the sixth ball, Perry takes her sixth wicket, with Shrubsole bowled by a big nipbacker. It hit the pad first, and Perry was in the process of appealing for LBW when she realised it had deflected onto the stumps. 18th over: England 41-7 (Shrubsole 7, Marsh 0) The offspinner Ashleigh Gardner comes into the attack. Her first ball is edged just wide of slip for a single by Shrubsole. That\u2019s your lot. \u201cThe indisputable pleasure I\u2019m absorbing from today\u2019s game will be something to remember fondly on Thursday in that, er, other cricket thing between our two countries,\u201d says Sarah Bacon. \u201cCall me old and cynical, but I can\u2019t help but imagine that Thursday\u2019s game will be clinical, ruthless and brutal. Hope you beat India in the final, England!\u201d I had no idea Australia were so into mind games. 17th over: England 40-7 (Shrubsole 6, Marsh 0) It\u2019s worth a reminder that England\u2019s lowest ODI score is 50. Their lowest against Australia is 79, a match which doubles up as their record defeat against the Aussies. Oh dear. Fran Wilson is bowled round her legs when she misses an attempted sweep off Schutt. Wilson played well for her 17, but that was an ugly dismissal. 16th over: England 39-6 (Wilson 16, Shrubsole 6) A maiden from Jonassen to Wilson. She keeps trying to slide an arm ball through Wilson\u2019s defence, thus far without success. 15th over: England 39-6 (Wilson 16, Shrubsole 6) Ultra-Edge shows that Shrubsole did get a thin bottom-edge through to Healy. There\u2019s no DRS in this series, however, so the umpire\u2019s decision is final. Meanwhile, Megan Schutt replaces Ellyse Perry (7-2-18-5) and has Shrubsole dropped by Healy. It was a front-foot no-ball, so it wouldn\u2019t have counted anyway; it was also a very difficult chance standing up to the stumps. 14th over: England 38-6 (Wilson 16, Shrubsole 6) Shrubsole rocks back to bash Jonassen through the covers for her first boundary. She almost falls trying to repeat the stroke, with the ball skidding under the bat. Healy went up for caught-behind but Martin Saggers wasn\u2019t interested. There was a noise as it went past the bat, though we haven\u2019t seen the Ultra-Edge verdict yet. 13th over: England 33-6 (Wilson 16, Shrubsole 1) Shrubsole edges Perry along the floor for a single to get off the mark. England\u2019s first target is 51; their lowest ODI score is 50, against India in 2005-06. Wilson, who has played nicely, moves England four runs closer with a confident slap through the covers. 12th over: England 27-6 (Wilson 12, Shrubsole 0) Unless one of the T20s are tied or rained off, England will have to win all four remaining games - one Test and three T20s - to regain the Ashes. 11th over: England 26-6 (Wilson 12, Shrubsole 0) Perry\u2019s best ODI figures are five for 19, against India at Mumbai in 2012. At the moment she has five for 12 - and she almost cements these as a new career-best when Wilson chips on the bounce to mid-on. \u201cAfternoon Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to compile an OBO highlights (lowlights?) reel to fill the next couple of hours at this rate...\u201d After 17 years of covering England, we should be able to find one or two. 10th over: England 26-6 (Wilson 12, Shrubsole 0) Jess Jonassen replaces Megan Schutt. Wilson, who has fallen to Jonassen twice already in this series, pulls the first ball for four. 9th over: England 21-6 (Wilson 7, Shrubsole 0) England have not batted well, with Beaumont, Sciver and Wyatt all out playing across the line. Only Sarah Taylor was blameless. But it\u2019s been an extraordinary performance from Perry: 5-1-12-5. She took a six-for in an Ashes Test on this ground four years agoa as well. Ellyse Perry is destroying England! Wyatt is the latest to go, pushing desperately around a full delivery that homes in on her front pad. Perry has five wickets ... already. Ellyse Perry gets her fourth wicket! Knight is drawn towards a wider, scrambled-seam delivery that shaves the edge and is pouched with glee by the wicketkeeper Healy. It was an injudicious stroke, but the seam isn\u2019t the only thing Perry scrambles. Even by her standards, this is stunning stuff. 8th over: England 18-4 (Knight 5, Wilson 6) The first boundary of the innings comes from the 51st ball, with Fran Wilson pulling Schutt carefully over square leg. Good shot. 7th over: England 14-4 (Knight 5, Wilson 2) 6th over: England 10-4 (Knight 4, Wilson 0) Replays confirm it was a very good decision by the umpire Martin Saggers. Sciver was a long way back and it would have hit the top of leg stump. There\u2019s no way back from here for England - in this match or, you suspect, in the Ashes. England are in disarray. Sciver is the third batter to be dismissed for nought, trapped on the back foot by a big inswinger from Megan Schutt. It might have been swinging past leg stump but on balance I think that\u2019s a good decision. 5th over: England 9-3 (Knight 3, Sciver 0) Heather Knight defends the hat-trick ball from Perry. England cannot even think about attacking at the moment, even though the required rate is approaching six an over. Knight takes a single off the last ball of the over, with a couple of wides pushing England to the dizzy heights of nine for three. 4th over: England 6-3 (Knight 2, Sciver 0) 3rd over: England 5-3 (Knight 1, Sciver 0) Ellyse Perry\u2019s figures are 2-1-4-3. And they don\u2019t even flatter her! Sarah Taylor goes for a golden duck! This is stunning stuff from Ellyse Perry. That was a brilliant delivery, almost unplayable for a new batter. It was angled in from wide on the crease and then curved way just enough to take a thin edge on its way through to Alyssa Healy. This is a quite majestic opening spell from Ellyse Perry. She has taken the big wicket of Tammy Beaumont, trapped plumb LBW as she played around a straight one. She could have fallen earlier in the over, too, when a leading edge looped just over backward point. 2nd over: England 1-1 (Beaumont 1, Knight 0) Megan Schutt shares the new ball. Australia have packed the off side for Tammy Beaumont, who made that glorious hundred at Leicester in the second ODI. She gets the first run of the innings and Knight blocks the rest of the over. This is a brilliant start for Australia. 1st over: England 0-1 (Beaumont 0, Knight 0) At the moment, Jones is Perry\u2019s bunny. She has fallen to her in all three ODIs, with a head-to-head average of 1.33. The new batter is Heather Knight, who has moved herself above Sarah Taylor, and she survives a huge should for caught behind first ball. It was a stunning delivery that shapes away and then seams back to beat Knight on the inside. Australia were certain it was out, but it was an eerily good bit of umpiring from Young Bumble, Graham Lloyd. The ball missed the inside edge and flicked the flap of the pad. A perfect start for Australia! Amy Jones, who has had a desperate series, chips an outswinger high in the air towards mid-on, where the substitute Nicola Carey takes a comfortable catch. Thanks Geoff, hello everyone. At the moment, Australia look a bit too good - for England, for everyone. As Geoff explains below, 269 is an intimidating total; for England to win, someone will have probably to play an innings that is close to career-defining. That\u2019s a big score. Lee Henderson emailed me (a few overs ago, granted) saying \u201cIt\u2019s looking like a competitive total from the Australians but probably not as high of a score as they\u2019d of wished for. How is the wicket playing? Any worries in it for the the English batters do you think? Perry has been able to get wickets on some benign surfaces before this.\u201d But in women\u2019s 50-over cricket we don\u2019t see a lot of big run chases. The batting revolution is ongoing. It\u2019s not so much about bowlers doing anything unplayable out of the surface, it\u2019s about being disciplined with where they bowl. Then it\u2019s on the batters to keep up with the rate without making a mistake. Usually those mistakes will come. England\u2019s biggest scores batting second are 272 (which they lost), 256 (which they lost) and 246 (which they lost). Their biggest winning chases were 243 and 242, which they made within a week of each other in 2008. So it\u2019s not like the current line-up has been running down big scores on the regular. Healy and Lanning set this game up perfectly for Australia, cruising to 68 and 69 respectively at strike rates of over 100. Then the rest of the order was just able to tot up some contributions and push that score up to something imposing. Jonassen especially has been so good with the bat down the order. Over to you, England \u2013 you need a special effort here to avoid going down 0-6 on points after three games of this series. Rob Smyth will take care of you for the chase. 50th over: Australia 269-7 (Jonassen 24, Kimmince 18) No boundaries from the final over, but 11 runs nonetheless. They swing at everything, finding the outfielders on each occasion. But Jonassen is able to run two to backward square, then Shrusbsole bowls a wide where they run an extra as well, and finally from the last ball Kimmince is dropped in the deep. Really goes after it, hits hard and very high to deep midwicket, and Beaumont can\u2019t handle the elevation and lets the ball drop through her hands, by which time they return for two more runs. 49th over: Australia 259-7 (Jonassen 19, Kimmince 15) Time to go, says Kimmince. After three singles she swats Ecclestone over cover, lofted, and there\u2019s another mistimed dive out there on the rope. I\u2019m marking a bit harshly on occasions, but England might be chasing 30 fewer runs if they had their outfield game honed. Against the best side you have to close the gap where you can. Kimmince thwacks straight down the ground next and runs well to return for two. Then walks cross and tries to scoop, nearly gets bowled, but gets glove on it past Taylor for four more. A flurry to end Ecclestone\u2019s allotment, which returns 1-50 from 10. 48th over: Australia 246-7 (Jonassen 17, Kimmince 4) Singles continue. Kimmince aims a huge shot at Shrubsole and is nearly bowled, but managed to edge it into her pad. Then Jonassen nearly runs herself out at the non-striker\u2019s end being too keen to back up. Five from the over, good from Shrubsole. 47th over: Australia 241-7 (Jonassen 14, Kimmince 2) It\u2019s down to Jonassen to be the pace-setter now, and she whips a couple of runs through midwicket, saved on the rope, before shovelling a drive over long-on for four. Eight from the Cross over with a couple of singles. 46th over: Australia 233-7 (Jonassen 7, Kimmince 1) Second ball of the over Marsh thinks she has Jonassen caught at mid-off, but Shrubsole signals that she\u2019s not sure if the ball carried, and the replays are as usual inconclusive. So JJ survives, but three balls later Gardner is bowled, and she\u2019s a more prized wicket. Delissa Kimmince will have to bat, after narrowly escaping that duty in the previous match. Straight through! Gardner goes for a big wipe across the line and doesn\u2019t hit it. Cricket\u2019s pretty simple sometimes. 45th over: Australia 231-6 (Gardner 29, Jonassen 7) Cross returns for Shrubsole, who still has two overs in the bank. The Australians are both swinging hard at Cross but can\u2019t land one. Three singles from her over, from increasingly high-octane shots. 44th over: Australia 228-6 (Gardner 28, Jonassen 5) Ecclestone bowls and Jonassen is dropped! Sweep shot, hard hit, and Marsh at short fine has to lunge across to her left but gets hands to it. Can\u2019t hold on. They\u2019re through for a single, one of five for the over. 43rd over: Australia 223-6 (Gardner 26, Jonassen 2) Then Australia swing it the other way! Shrubsole starts her over and Gardner leans back towards leg and whacks this uppishly into the cover gap for four. Powerful shot. But not as powerful as her next, as she again leans away to make room but this time hauls her pull shot over wide long-on for six. First of the innings, and that\u2019s what Gardner can do. The purest striker of the ball in this team. That wasn\u2019t entirely there for the shot but she just muscled it, dragged it from a line on her ribs away in the air. Those are the only scoring shots from the over, but Shrubsole throws in a wide as well. 42nd over: Australia 212-6 (Gardner 16, Jonassen 2) Another quite one, two runs from Ecclestone. England edging back into this. 41st over: Australia 210-6 (Gardner 15, Jonassen 1) The Shrub to continue, branching out into her seventh over. Gardner makes good contact to steer a run behind point. Jonassen works her first through square. Two from the over. Good news for England. 40th over: Australia 2o8-6 (Gardner 14, Jonassen 0) Jess Jonassen in next, who conversely has been in great touch. An important 19 and then 31 not out in finishing off Australia\u2019s two run chases at Leicester. She\u2019s happy to block away the last three balls of Ecclestone\u2019s seventh over. Good bowling! Haynes never looked set, and hasn\u2019t really looked it all series. Trying to force the pace she advances at Ecclestone, but gets more dip than expected. The attempted loft turns into a toe-end drag low back to the bowler, who takes it easily. 39th over: Australia 2o5-5 (Haynes 12, Gardner 11) Shrubsole back. I thought they might have tried this earlier to search for another wicket. She nearly gets one via Gardner\u2019s nick, but beats the edge. Just two singles from the over. 38th over: Australia 2o3-5 (Haynes 11, Gardner 10) \u201cCome on ladies, let\u2019s go, six down!\u201d I love English chat from this team. Their accents, they all sounds so polite. Where I\u2019m from it\u2019s a sign of friendship if you hit someone with a plate. Gardner can\u2019t get loose. Marsh has become a quagmire. But from the last ball Gardner pulls free, thumping a short ball through square leg to raise the 200. Still a dozen overs to go, so a tall total is still on the cards. 37th over: Australia 197-5 (Haynes 10, Gardner 5) Ash Gardner can hit a long way, but she\u2019s bit ropey starting against Cross. Three dots, finding the field. An outside edge that rolls for four. A pad to midwicket and she\u2019s called through for a dashed leg bye. Just gets there. Keeps strike. 36th over: Australia 191-5 (Haynes 9, Gardner 1) A good opportunity to get through a quiet over, and Marsh does so for three singles. 35th over: Australia 188-5 (Haynes 7, Gardner 0) That\u2019s huge for Cross. She\u2019s battled to get back into this team for a couple of years and hasn\u2019t blown the lights out since she got back. She did provide the bowling ammunition for Fran Wilson to take one of the best catches anyone has ever seen at point the other week against the West Indies, but she\u2019ll feel happier with this wicket that she earned all on her own. HawkEye says it might have clipped the outside of leg. To be honest I\u2019d rather umpires who are bit more willing to give decisions than ones who turn everything down. Kate Cross breaks through! She\u2019s had a tough day but angles a ball in towards Mooney from around the wicket, beats the shot across the ball and strikes pad. Mooney was a long way forward and that hit her leg side, but Martin Sagers has been very quick on the draw in this series and gives it. Mooney does not appear to agree as she departs. 34th over: Australia 187-4 (Haynes 6, Mooney 19) Very civilised cricket, as the bats gather four singles from Marsh. 33rd over: Australia 183-4 (Haynes 4, Mooney 17) Thanks Lee. My only hope is that the C++ assignment gets a better grade than a C++. Kate Cross returns after drinks, having been spanked for 31 from her first five overs when Healy took a shine to her and a shine off the ball by bounding it into the fence. More of the same I\u2019m afraid, as she follows two wides down leg with a ball wide enough outside off for Mooney to carve four behind point. A single off the hip to deep square. Two lefties at the crease, with Haynes taking strike. Short in stature but times the ball well. Defends the last ball watchfully. While we have a drinks break, let\u2019s have a dessert break with Lee Henderson. \u201cMorning evening Geoff. Tis Sunday night in Australia and in a room in this household we have the BBC on and Romans doing dastardly things to Caledonians and in another room an assignment on CC++ is being finalised (hopefully). Blissfully aware of this in a peripheral way as I sit in another room, and jam roly poly and warm(-ish) custard and cream are piled high in what would pass as a serving bowl if a less greedy soul had served it up. Overriding the whole thing is the 42\u201d(mirrored) monitor serving up the OBO of the Women\u2019s Ashes with a feed of the radio broadcast from the Beeb to compliment. In answer to your question: does it/can it get any better than this? No. It can\u2019t. \u201c*Peter Gabriel. We can be heroes. This applies to both these great teams. Go girls!\u201d 32nd over: Australia 176-4 (Haynes 4, Mooney 12) Nap time is over. Beth Mooney is awake. She\u2019s Australia\u2019s T20 opener so she likes to get moving. Laura Marsh is back for Knight, so Mooney advances and pops the ball over mid-on with minimum fuss. Then cuts behind point and half-beats the field, enough for two more runs. Drinks. 31st over: Australia 170-4 (Haynes 4, Mooney 6) Quiet time continues, with four runs and a leg bye from Sciver\u2019s over. No more wickets. Speaking of technical improvements, here\u2019s an observation. This is the third Women\u2019s Ashes match I\u2019ve attended this series, two at Leicester and this one at Canterbury. At none of those three matches has there been a working television set in the press box. Meaning there\u2019s no way to watch a replay of any incident in the match that we\u2019re reporting on, which makes the reporting part pretty tough. \u201cIt\u2019s broken,\u201d has been the response at two separate international grounds hosting three international matches. It\u2019s a minor thing overall, sure, but it\u2019s very indicative. There is no way on earth that the situation would be allowed to stand in a men\u2019s match. 30th over: Australia 165-4 (Haynes 3, Mooney 2) Just the single from Knight\u2019s over, as England try to turn at least a few screws. A good save from the last ball in the infield is important. \u201cLove the coverage,\u201d says an email that I didn\u2019t write. Thank you, John Box. \u201cCan I propose that the scorecard should be available as a tab on the website feed as it is with men\u2019s Tests and ODIs?\u201d You can propose that, and hopefully one of our editors is reading who has more power and technical know-how than I do to make this happen. 29th over: Australia 164-4 (Haynes 3, Mooney 2) A new partnership then, with Haynes and Beth Mooney. Three singles to them to start, and Sciver has the idiosyncratic bowling figures of 7 overs, 3 for 47. Hello! Nat Sciver is dragging her side back into it! Similar to Perry\u2019s last dismissal, this is a very wide and short ball. The Australian plays a cut shot and only nicks it, for Sarah Taylor to take an excellent catch standing up to the stumps for the seamer. 28th over: Australia 160-3 (Perry 7, Haynes 1) Rachael Haynes, the left-hander, comes in and gets off the mark against Knight in quick time by belting a single. Knight then bowls three wides down the leg side, luckily bowling slowly enough that the ball can be saved before the rope. 27th over: Australia 155-3 (Perry 6) Lanning out last ball of the Sciver over, after Perry had faced the first five balls. Doesn\u2019t look like the delivery did anything off the pitch, it was just mistimed. Breakthrough! Sciver finding a way against the grain again. Back of a length, Lanning tries to turn it to the leg side but mistimes it. Gets a leading edge that pops up to point for a simple catch. Huge wicket the way she was batting. 26th over: Australia 151-2 (Lanning 69, Perry 3) Heather Knight will have a bowl. Off-breaks, just like Marsh who she\u2019s replacing. Knight hasn\u2019t bowled yet in the series, but with seamer Katherine Brunt out for keeper-bat Sarah Taylor today, Sciver becomes the fifth bowler and Knight the sixth. It doesn\u2019t work out so well, as Lanning squeezes a couple to third man, then trades singles, before Perry drives behind square and beats Wyatt on the rope for four. Another over worth 10 runs. England have been very poor in the outfield today. Half a dozen boundaries conceded that should have been singles. They\u2019re not playing like a team that knows how to dive. They get close to the ball and then sort of fall over in its general direction and hope that works. 25th over: Australia 141-2 (Lanning 60, Perry 2) Things will settle down a bit with Perry at the crease, I think. Healy\u2019s specialty the last couple of years has been breezing along at a run a ball even when no one else can get close. She attacks judiciously and is good enough to get away with it more often than not, and in doing so she rattles fielding sides and creates more opportunities for herself, whether with bad bowling or opening space in the field. Three singles from the Sciver over. 24th over: Australia 138-2 (Lanning 58, Perry 1) Not quite sure about the strategy of bowling an off-spinner without much turn around the wicket against a right-hander. Marsh leaves one outside leg stumps and Lanning sweeps it comfortably for four backward of square. 23rd over: Australia 131-2 (Lanning 52, Perry 0) Ten runs and a wicket from the over. You get rid of Healy, and Perry walks out. Would you like to know how many century stands she has with Meg Lanning? No? I\u2019ll keep it to myself. Somehow, Sciver finds a way to stem the bleeding. She\u2019s clobbered for four behind square by Healy, then bowls five wides down the leg side. But when she dishes up a rank half-tracker for Healy to put anywhere she likes, the shot finds Wyatt in the deep at midwicket, who takes a good catch. England collapse on the floor heaving sighs of relief. 22nd over: Australia 121-1 (Healy 64, Lanning 51) Imposing when two players out there rack up fifty at a run a ball each. Lanning taps Marsh into the covers and darts the quick run. Healy returns the favour, then again. Healy mows to deep midwicket on the bounce but this time Jones can get around to field. A hundred partnership. 21st over: Australia 117-1 (Healy 62, Lanning 49) Ecclestone is the one they\u2019re being careful against. Just the three singles, and she\u2019s bowled six overs for 27. 20th over: Australia 114-1 (Healy 61, Lanning 47) Tee-off time is back. Lanning skips to Marsh again and drives over cover. It wasn\u2019t completely clean, there was that kind of clunky tinny sound off the bat that suggests it was the outside half of the bat, but the field is up. A few singles follow, then Healy gets a short one and absolutely crushes it through square leg along the ground. Flat and bouncing into the boards. 19th over: Australia 102-1 (Healy 55, Lanning 41) Ecclestone bowling tight on the stumps to Healy in this over, trying not to give any room. Just a single from the fifth ball. There\u2019s nearly a late Lanning edge for runs again but this time it\u2019s saved. For anyone following the men\u2019s Ashes as well, here\u2019s an update on Jimmy Anderson\u2019s recent injury issue. 18th over: Australia 101-1 (Healy 54, Lanning 41) Spin from both ends now, with Laura Marsh\u2019s off-breaks to partner Ecclestone\u2019s left-arm orthos. Thing start well for her with three singles and a couple of dots, but Lanning closes the over by slashing a wide flighted ball off the top edge of her angled bat and fine of short third for four. The ton is up. 17th over: Australia 94-1 (Healy 52, Lanning 36) Sophie Ecclestone does the tough job of keeping Healy quiet for an over, as the Australians ease back into things after the break. Two singles. Such a good early run rate that there\u2019s no need to rush. 16th over: Australia 92-1 (Healy 51, Lanning 35) Shot for shot now! Lanning is suddenly starting to look herself again. Width from Sciver so Lanning drives it square to perfection, the full Lara flourish of the bat through the line of the ball and then the follow-through. As so often happens Sciver goes a bit shorter and straighter, so Lanning pounds the pull shot behind square and once again beats a despairing dive. They\u2019ve been able to find the fence relentlessly this morning. The last four overs have gone for 9, 10, 11 and 9. That\u2019s drinks. 15th over: Australia 83-1 (Healy 51, Lanning 26) This is looking ominous, after England asked Australia to bat. Lanning punches Ecclestone through point for four, then skips down to drive a single to deep cover. Jones coming around finally gets one that gives her a better chance of saving it, and does so. But with one ball to come Ecclestone drags down badly, and Healy punishes it with a pull shot that splits the leg-side sweepers square of the wicket. That\u2019s her fifty. 14th over: Australia 73-1 (Healy 46, Lanning 21) \u201cShe\u2019s super straight, super straight, yeah, she\u2019s super straight.\u201d Healy drives yet another dead straight boundary, this time from Sciver. Music by Regurgitator, Brisbane\u2019s finest. Not to be outdone, Lanning stands up to drive on the up, into the cover gap, and with enough power to beat the outfielder for four. What a shot. In terms of technical difficulty, that\u2019s the best we\u2019ve seen today. 13th over: Australia 62-1 (Healy 41, Lanning 16) Now it\u2019s Lanning\u2019s turn. She has the left-arm spinner bowling around the wicket with a deep cover point but the rest of the off-side field up. So Lanning skips down to a flighted ball and lofts it over cover for four! Easy done. Next ball is fuller, a smaller shuffle and this time it goes along the carpet the same way for the same result. Jones makes a hash of it again, leaning back and going legs first as she slides, guaranteeing she won\u2019t reach the ball, rather than diving hands first to save it. I suppose wicketkeepers don\u2019t do a lot of boundary riding. Bit unreasonable to ask her to do the gig, then? 12th over: Australia 53-1 (Healy 41, Lanning 7) Oh, stop it. Nat Sciver comes on for Cross but she doesn\u2019t get treated any more kindly. First ball she bowls, Healy plays a gorgeous on-drive through midwicket, which gives you a sense of how well it was timed. Beat the sweeper along the ground into the fence. Healy, as she often has in the last couple of years, is batting on a different pitch. 11th over: Australia 47-1 (Healy 36, Lanning 6) Sophie Ecclestone on with left-arm spin as the fielding restrictions are relaxed. Lanning dobs to cover and rushes a single. Healy carves another. Two from the over. 10th over: Australia 45-1 (Healy 35, Lanning 5) Cross pitches up to Healy and is drive straight for four! Lovely shot, high elbow, right by the stumps and splitting the mid-off and mid-on fielders down to the sightscreen. Cross tries again, a foot shorter, same result, more of a whip-drive from Healy bringing her hands through the ball rather than her elbow, but dead straight again for four! Done yet? Not quite. Anticipating a shorter length in response, Healy goes back on her stumps and whips, lofted, across the line to deep midwicket. Jones is out there, but her one-handed parry at the bouncing ball doesn\u2019t slap it back into play, but over the line for four. Get her back into slip, stat. Healy finishes off with a steer behind point for two more. Big over, she\u2019s 35 from 31 now. 9th over: Australia 31-1 (Healy 21, Lanning 5) Another shout from Shrubsole from a ball angling down leg, but the right-handed Lanning gets more lenience from the umpire. A couple of balls later she has another chance at the whip off the pads and this time nails it for four. 8th over: Australia 27-1 (Healy 21, Lanning 1) Healy loves going square on the off side, and she does so again against Cross for four with a drive. Cross gets some serious swing against Lanning and takes her edge, but it reaches slip on the bounce. Amy Jones is standing there, not wicketkeeping today with Taylor back. Lanning plays a classic Lanning shot next, opening the face and striking with a nice clean sound off the bat down through backward point, where she has scored so, so many of her international runs. 7th over: Australia 21-1 (Healy 16, Lanning 0) A wicket maiden for Shrubsole as Lanning arrives and carefully negotiates a couple of swinging deliveries. No big scores for Lanning for a while, and averaging 30 since she came back from her long layoff with a shoulder injury. Has the chance today to bat long. The HawkEye replay, which is not available to the umpires because there is still absurdly almost never DRS in women\u2019s cricket, says that Bolton\u2019s delivery was missing leg stump. Not by much, so I wouldn\u2019t class the call as a shocker, but it looked marginally not out live. First one for England! Bolton doesn\u2019t like that. She\u2019s struck on the pad and is wandering away to square leg casually, then hears the cheer from England and whips her head around to stare at the umpire in disbelief. That was going down leg, wasn\u2019t it? On first glance. Bolton is walking off, but the replay tends to confirm that suspicion. Maybe it could have grazed leg stump? But there was a fair bit of angle from around the wicket, to the left-hander, and I don\u2019t think it was straightening or swinging in. 6th over: Australia 21-0 (Healy 16, Bolton 4) Healy is playing more shots than Bolton but not getting many more runs for them. A couple of cuts, one mistimed, one saved by Wilson. A couple of runs skewed through cover, and eventually a single when Healy gets the cut shot angled back through short third rather than square to the field. Bolton takes off for a leg bye to close the over. 5th over: Australia 17-0 (Healy 13, Bolton 4) Thanks Mike! What a gent, holding the controls while I made the long trip from Manchester, where I was reporting on Australia-South Africa in the World Cup last night, to Canterbury this morning. Just the five and a half hours with the M1 closed, if you\u2019re wondering. Bliss. Glad to be here at the end of it, as Nicole Bolton drives Shrubsole for four through mid-on, then plays out the rest of the over quite carefully, blocking on off stump as Shrubbers comes around the wicket and tries to angle the ball in. 4th over: Australia 13-0 (Healy 13, Bolton 0) Healy finds the boundary again with a chip over mid-wicket for four runs. A big shout comes at the end of the over as she gets a bit tucked up but the ball\u2019s going down leg again. And with that, I\u2019ll leave you in the capable hands of Geoff Lemon, who has got himself into the hot seat in Canterbury and will be here to guide you through the remainder of the Australia innings. Toodle pip. 3rd over: Australia 9-0 (Healy 9, Bolton 0) Shrubsole is getting some decent movement in the air; Nicole Bolton watches the ball well but can\u2019t get it away for any runs. An excellent over, the first maiden of the game. 2nd over: Australia 9-0 (Healy 9, Bolton 0) Kate Cross opens from the other end. Healy is tempted by the first delivery, outside off, but doesn\u2019t connect. But she does before too long as she finds the boundary with nothing more than a little flick off the legs that races away. Sciver gets to it, but can\u2019t save the four runs. 1st over: Australia 5-0 (Healy 5, Bolton 0) Shrubsole opens the bowling and it takes just one sighter for Healy before she opens up and flashes a wide one away to the boundary to get Australia up and running. A ball later Shrubsle produces some huge swing to rap Healy on the pads, but it\u2019s going down leg and despite the big shout, there\u2019s nothing doing. Healy races through for a single and that\u2019s the first over done. England players run onto the pitch, and we\u2019re nearly ready to go. \u201cIts a shame,\u201d writes Tim from Bramhall, \u201cthat this series is so low profile, not helped by scheduling alongside the CWC. But I can\u2019t help feeling that the location of these matches does not help, staged in mainly Southern or East Midlands small county grounds. Why does the ECB not take these matches to the cities, and why does the North not get a look in?\u201d Geoff Lemon touched on these very issues in the immediate aftermath of the first ODI in Leicester. This will be the first of two meetings between these two great cricketing nations in the space of five days \u2013 they will clash again on Thursday in the men\u2019s World Cup, after Australia failed to beat South Africa in their final round-robin game at Old Trafford 24 hours ago and as a result were leapfrogged by India into first place. Tanya Aldred\u2019s match report from Old Trafford is pretty tremendous: South Africa left the World Cup with a defiant raspberry, defeating Australia by 10 runs in another Old Trafford last-over thriller to set up a semi-final between England and Australia on Thursday. Tension had mounted after the result zipped across from Headingley, which meant Australia had to beat South Africa to finish top of the table \u2013 fail, and India would tuck into the freshly prepared New Zealand fattened calf, tender and soft, and send the reigning champions instead to Birmingham. Geoff Lemon\u2019s piece on the contest between two old mates is also not too shabby. Confirmation of the lineups. England: Jones, Beaumont, Taylor (wicketkeeper), Sciver, Knight (captain), Wilson, Wyatt, Shrubsole, Cross, Marsh, Ecclestone. Australia: Bolton, Healy (wicketkeeper), Lanning (captain), Perry, Haynes, Mooney, Gardner, Kimmince, Wareham, Jonassen, Schutt. Team news. England are forced into making one change: Katherine Brunt is indeed out with that ankle knock, so Sarah Taylor comes in. Australia are unchanged. Captain Lanning says she \u201cwasn\u2019t too bothered\u201d about losing the toss. \u201cIt\u2019s a good batting wicket and it won\u2019t change too much throughout the day.\u201d Ominously she says there\u2019s still room for Australian improvement. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive game,\u201d she adds. Meg Lanning calls heads... it\u2019s tails and England captain Heather Knight says the hosts will put Australia into bat. Weather update. Geoff will be able to give you a more accurate view from his position on the ground at Canterbury later on, but a quick internet search tells me it\u2019s currently 17C and cloudy with a light breeze and a small chance of rain between 11am and 1pm local. And this appears to confirm the cloud cover: Still, there have been words of caution after the opening game from Australia bowler and Guardian guest columnist, Megan Schutt: Remember, they made it to the World T20 final last year missing two of their best players. They are scrappers, which is what makes these amazing games. It\u2019s why I love this series more than any other: there\u2019s no hiding. Winning against them is so satisfying because you have to earn it. Injuries. Not helping the host nation\u2019s cause has been the couple of concerns casting a shadow over today\u2019s game; Sarah Taylor missed the second ODI after picking up an ankle knock while Katherine Brunt also injured her ankle \u2013 while celebrating the key dismissal of Lanning during that game. Both will undergo late fitness tests before play starts today. How close are Australia to wrapping up the series? Another win in Kent today and Meg Lanning\u2019s side will move onto six points, having picked up two for each preceding win. With just eight needed to retain the title, they\u2019re close \u2013 a win (four points) or even a draw (two) in the Test at Taunton would be enough, or failing that, just one win from the three T20s (two each) would seal the deal. In short, England badly need to win today if they are going to retain any realistic hopes alive of winning the series. So, from back-to-back 50-over games in Leicester to a final one in this format at the historic St Lawrence Ground in Canterbury, before the travelling roadshow heads to a one-off Test later this month, followed by three final Twenty20s. Competitive interest in the series may well be gone by the time it comes to the last part of this multi-format series though, with Australia already well positioned to retain the Ashes having won the opening two fixtures of this points-based series. More on the ins and outs of that in a moment, but for now, there\u2019s just time for a bit of housekeeping \u2013 send an email (mike.hytner@theguardian.com) or tweet (@mike_hytner) if you\u2019d like to get anything off your chest before Geoff Lemon steps in for the start of play in around an hour\u2019s time.",

      "body": "<p>Seven years ago, a group of Conservative MPs who had taken their parliamentary seats in 2010 brought out a slim manifesto for the future of Britain titled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/britannia-unchained-rise-of-new-tory-right\" title=\"\">Britannia Unchained</a>. Kwasi Kwarteng, Priti Patel, Dominic Raab, Chris Skidmore and Liz Truss appeared to speak with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/27/britannia-unchained-global-lessons-review\" title=\"\">one voice</a>: that of unabashed Thatcherites, convinced that hacking back tax and regulation and fixating on the demands of \u201cbusiness\u201d was as appropriate for the 21st-century UK as it supposedly had been for the crisis-plagued Britain of the 1970s.</p> <p>Some of the text was so provocative that it read like trolling. \u201cThe British are among the worst idlers in the world,\u201d read one passage. \u201cWe work among the lowest hours, we retire early and our productivity is poor. Whereas Indian children aspire to be doctors or businessmen, the British are more interested in football and pop music.\u201d To even start to compete with the rising economies of India, China and Brazil, said the authors, we need to avenge the \u201cdependency culture\u201d and \u201cstop indulging in irrelevant debates about sharing the pie between manufacturing and services, the north and the south, women and men\u201d. They advised fellow Conservatives to double down on austerity, and maintain their faith in old-fashioned laissez-faire economics.</p> <p>All five of the Britannia Unchained gang are now supporters of Boris Johnson. They may be wincing at his scattergun spending pledges, but they are presumably thrilled by his embrace of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/01/boris-johnson-pledges-to-increase-stop-and-search-powers\" title=\"\">cutting corporation tax</a>; what <a href=\"https://www.tax.org.uk/media-centre/blog/media-and-politics/boris-johnson-%E2%80%98preparing-emergency-budget-september%E2%80%99\" title=\"\">one report called</a> \u201ca Trump-styled moratorium on all new regulations\u201d; and the surreal idea of turning at least six UK places \u2013 including Belfast \u2013 into \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/02/boris-johnson-jeremy-hunt-accused-of-trying-to-turn-uk-into-tax-haven-freeports\" title=\"\">free ports</a>\u201d that would charge no taxes or tariffs.

In response to the sugar tax story, she <a href=\"https://twitter.com/trussliz/status/1146304599764197376\" title=\"\">tweeted</a>: \u201cTaxes on treats hits those on lowest incomes. We should be #freetochoose.\u201d The apparent suggestion was that if the rich were to pay less tax, it was only right that the poor should get a few pence off their next soft drink, with the consequence \u2013 incidental, of course \u2013 that big corporations (such as Coca-Cola, linked to Johnson via one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/03/boris-johnson-cynical-sin-tax-freeze-glimpse-whats-to-come\" title=\"\">Will Walden</a>, an adviser who works for a lobbying firm that represents it) would be able to once again load their output with as much bad stuff as before.</p> <p>None of this was terribly surprising. In the recent past, Truss has bemoaned the tendency of people in positions of power to sound off about people \u201cdrinking too much\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-44624009\" title=\"\">eating too many doughnuts</a>\u201d. If that holds out the prospect of a growing burden on the NHS, she appears to have that covered: calls for increased spending, it seems, may yet be offset by the wonders of technology, a subject that this self-styled \u201c<a href=\"https://www.totalpolitics.com/articles/diary/liz-truss-ambitious-bid-rebrand-herself-disrupter-chief\" title=\"\">disruptor-in-chief</a>\u201d has attempted to make her own. \u201cIn health, disruptive new entrepreneurs are <a href=\"https://policyexchange.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Making-the-case-for-the-free-market-transcript.pdf\" title=\"\">revolutionising hospital treatment</a>,\u201d she offered, back in January last year. \u201cEveryday goods like smart watches have the potential to transform public health. With real-time peer-to-peer information, like TripAdvisor, surely we can remove some of our bureaucracy?\u201d</p> <p>Which brings us to something very interesting. If you want a sense of how the looming Johnson administration might deal with the ever-increasing questions hanging over Big Tech, Truss is a good person to watch. For the best part of two years, she has been making speeches warning any would-be interveners that such companies should be left alone. When Labour talked about \u201cdigital monopolies\u201d profiting from everyone\u2019s searches and shares, and said it might impose a windfall tax on them to fund public interest journalism, she jumped to the conclusion that it wanted to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/liz-truss-jeremy-corbyn-internet_uk_5bb386e8e4b00fe9f4fad654\" title=\"\">nationalise the internet</a>\u201d. As she sees it, <a href=\"https://capx.co/the-conservative-case-for-disruption/\" title=\"\">Uber is simply</a> \u201ca company that is bringing choice and value to huge numbers of people\u201d, while Airbnb is \u201cmaking it easier for people to rent out rooms or to find a cheaper place to stay\u201d. This sounds less like intelligent politics than someone reading out adverts while sitting on the tube, but it reflects a belief that \u201c<a href=\"https://1828uk.com/2019/01/30/fighting-corbyn-with-freedom-how-to-embrace-generation-z-2/\" title=\"\">people who want to change the nature of the internet</a>\u201d, and thereby imperil \u201clifestyle freedom\u201d, are the enemies of liberty.</p> <p>What Truss and her ilk don\u2019t seem to understand is that lots of trailblazing, decidedly libertarian tech people don\u2019t like these companies either, rightly seeing them as malignant concentrations of power antithetical to the internet\u2019s original ethos (witness the droves of people working on blockchain technology, and aiming to foster decentralised alternatives to the established platforms). As with the corporations now at the heart of the modern food economy, the internet\u2019s big players have been through their unregulated, disruptive phase, much as traditional industries went through their equivalent in the 19th century. And just as we now have to talk about diet and public health, so we are now in a period marked by these platforms\u2019 obvious downsides: an array of damaging effects on society; and the fact that, true to capitalist form, the most powerful firms have hardened into monopolies, which tend to eat up any startups that pose a threat.</p> <p>In the Britannia Unchained view of things, the only way to deal with these problems is to encourage a kind of \u201ccompetition\u201d that Big Tech\u2019s power has long since squashed \u2013 and to suggest that these imbalances demand action by governments is to embrace the thinking of the bureaucrat, a belief that neatly chimes with Brexit.

      "bodyText": "Seven years ago, a group of Conservative MPs who had taken their parliamentary seats in 2010 brought out a slim manifesto for the future of Britain titled Britannia Unchained. Kwasi Kwarteng, Priti Patel, Dominic Raab, Chris Skidmore and Liz Truss appeared to speak with one voice: that of unabashed Thatcherites, convinced that hacking back tax and regulation and fixating on the demands of \u201cbusiness\u201d was as appropriate for the 21st-century UK as it supposedly had been for the crisis-plagued Britain of the 1970s. Some of the text was so provocative that it read like trolling. \u201cThe British are among the worst idlers in the world,\u201d read one passage. \u201cWe work among the lowest hours, we retire early and our productivity is poor. Whereas Indian children aspire to be doctors or businessmen, the British are more interested in football and pop music.\u201d To even start to compete with the rising economies of India, China and Brazil, said the authors, we need to avenge the \u201cdependency culture\u201d and \u201cstop indulging in irrelevant debates about sharing the pie between manufacturing and services, the north and the south, women and men\u201d. They advised fellow Conservatives to double down on austerity, and maintain their faith in old-fashioned laissez-faire economics. All five of the Britannia Unchained gang are now supporters of Boris Johnson. They may be wincing at his scattergun spending pledges, but they are presumably thrilled by his embrace of cutting corporation tax; what one report called \u201ca Trump-styled moratorium on all new regulations\u201d; and the surreal idea of turning at least six UK places \u2013 including Belfast \u2013 into \u201cfree ports\u201d that would charge no taxes or tariffs. Of a piece, of course, was his brilliantly timed move last week, when news that obesity was now rivalling smoking as a cause of cancer coincided with his hostile manoeuvrings on the so-called sugar tax. Among the most high-profile Tories at the forefront of Johnson\u2019s leadership campaign is Truss, the current chief secretary to the Treasury. In response to the sugar tax story, she tweeted: \u201cTaxes on treats hits those on lowest incomes. We should be #freetochoose.\u201d The apparent suggestion was that if the rich were to pay less tax, it was only right that the poor should get a few pence off their next soft drink, with the consequence \u2013 incidental, of course \u2013 that big corporations (such as Coca-Cola, linked to Johnson via one Will Walden, an adviser who works for a lobbying firm that represents it) would be able to once again load their output with as much bad stuff as before. None of this was terribly surprising. In the recent past, Truss has bemoaned the tendency of people in positions of power to sound off about people \u201cdrinking too much\u201d and \u201ceating too many doughnuts\u201d. If that holds out the prospect of a growing burden on the NHS, she appears to have that covered: calls for increased spending, it seems, may yet be offset by the wonders of technology, a subject that this self-styled \u201cdisruptor-in-chief\u201d has attempted to make her own. \u201cIn health, disruptive new entrepreneurs are revolutionising hospital treatment,\u201d she offered, back in January last year. \u201cEveryday goods like smart watches have the potential to transform public health. With real-time peer-to-peer information, like TripAdvisor, surely we can remove some of our bureaucracy?\u201d Which brings us to something very interesting. If you want a sense of how the looming Johnson administration might deal with the ever-increasing questions hanging over Big Tech, Truss is a good person to watch. For the best part of two years, she has been making speeches warning any would-be interveners that such companies should be left alone. When Labour talked about \u201cdigital monopolies\u201d profiting from everyone\u2019s searches and shares, and said it might impose a windfall tax on them to fund public interest journalism, she jumped to the conclusion that it wanted to \u201cnationalise the internet\u201d. As she sees it, Uber is simply \u201ca company that is bringing choice and value to huge numbers of people\u201d, while Airbnb is \u201cmaking it easier for people to rent out rooms or to find a cheaper place to stay\u201d. This sounds less like intelligent politics than someone reading out adverts while sitting on the tube, but it reflects a belief that \u201cpeople who want to change the nature of the internet\u201d, and thereby imperil \u201clifestyle freedom\u201d, are the enemies of liberty. What Truss and her ilk don\u2019t seem to understand is that lots of trailblazing, decidedly libertarian tech people don\u2019t like these companies either, rightly seeing them as malignant concentrations of power antithetical to the internet\u2019s original ethos (witness the droves of people working on blockchain technology, and aiming to foster decentralised alternatives to the established platforms). As with the corporations now at the heart of the modern food economy, the internet\u2019s big players have been through their unregulated, disruptive phase, much as traditional industries went through their equivalent in the 19th century. And just as we now have to talk about diet and public health, so we are now in a period marked by these platforms\u2019 obvious downsides: an array of damaging effects on society; and the fact that, true to capitalist form, the most powerful firms have hardened into monopolies, which tend to eat up any startups that pose a threat. In the Britannia Unchained view of things, the only way to deal with these problems is to encourage a kind of \u201ccompetition\u201d that Big Tech\u2019s power has long since squashed \u2013 and to suggest that these imbalances demand action by governments is to embrace the thinking of the bureaucrat, a belief that neatly chimes with Brexit. The EU has been in the forefront of conversations about what to do about Uber, Amazon, Facebook, Google and all the rest. So have politicians and institutions in the US, as well as many Silicon Valley insiders who believe in the profit motive and the wonders of free trade as a matter of instinct. But some 21st-century Tories are so lost in the woods that their instinctive position is to scoff at any claim that all this activity is about protecting consumers and innovators, insisting instead that it is time to rush to the aid of the free market, even where the free market has long since ceased to exist. Truss says she believes in \u201ca nation of Airbnb-ing, Deliveroo-eating, Uber-riding freedom fighters\u201d, but what she and many other Johnson supporters seem to be advocating is much less flash: leaving monopolies and oligopolies untroubled, in the service of our old friend, disaster capitalism. We all know what they have in mind. Come the autumn, Britain may well get a huge shock, and penury will beckon. The only way to avoid it, we will be told, will be to bin regulation, drastically lower taxes, and become tech, finance and the corporate food industry\u2019s offshore playground. Then a terrifying future will open up: a few people creaming it in, while millions of ill, poor, eternally insecure people remain glued to their smartphones to either await their next casual shift in a fulfilment centre or spend whatever crumbs they are paid on the latest useless innovation. Such are the uplands of freedom offered by a party that seems to have lost what was left of its moral bearings, and resolved not to unchain us, but to imprison Britain in true-blue stupidity. \u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "Thanks for reading and for your emails and tweets. Congratulations to Jumbo-Visma and Mike Teunissen, who were supreme today. Join Barry Glendenning tomorrow for stage three, which starts in Binche in Belgium and ends 215km later in \u00c9pernay, France. See ya! If those are the GC riders that impressed, it\u2019s worth noting the ones that had a nightmare today: namely Ritchie Porte and Romain Bardet, who may be out of the GC reckoning before we even get to France, his homeland. Porte and Bardet are 1min18secs and 1min19secs off the pace already, after their respective teams, AG2R La Mondiale and Trek\u2013Segafredo, toiled here in the TTT. For the other French GC contender, Thibaut Pinot, hope remains. Groupama-FDJ are 32 seconds off the lead, but just 12 seconds behind Team Inoes. So a quick round-up of who is wearing what. Mike Teunissen is in yellow. Mike Teunissen also leads the sprinting standings, but as he\u2019s already wearing yellow, Peter Sagan will be in green for Stage Three. Greg Van Avermaet is in that polkadot number as King of the Mountains. Caleb Ewan is in white, the best young rider so far. We\u2019ve also had an email regarding today\u2019s action in the Giro Rosa \u2013 stage three was a 104.2km hilly route from Sagliano Micca to Piedicavallo Results 1: Marianne Vos 2: Lucy Kennedy 3: Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig With an initial descent into the valley followed by a slow and steady climb up to a steep cobbled finish, the route featured plenty of attacks through the day. Marianne Vos claimed her second and consecutive stage win in this year\u2019s Giro. Lucy Kennedy kept the pace up on her late attack well enough to finish second, with Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig in third. Kasia Niewiadoma keeps the pink jersey. That average speed is absolutely insane: 35.54mph. That\u2019s not quite the fastest ever TTT average speed: Orica GreenEDGE (now Mitchelton-Scott) recorded 57.841km/h around Nice back in 2013. Here\u2019s Jumbo-Visma\u2019s Mike Teunissen, who retained the yellow jersey today. Yesterday was a dream. Indeed, it is again today. It was really hard, because of the crash of Dylan [Groenewegen yesterday], he couldn\u2019t give his all. We were a man down, but everyone kept their pace. We heard we were fastest and that gave us morale. So did this yellow jersey. I\u2019m not getting used to winning stages in the Tour but that\u2019s two out of two. Yesterday, I took most of the credit but it\u2019s a real team effort. It\u2019s unbelievable. I want to thank everyone. Away from the very top of the standings, Team Katusha Alpecin had a great ride, finishing in fifth place, 26 seconds behind Jumbo-Visma. Here\u2019s British rider Alex Dowsett assessing their performance: That was one of the most perfect time trials, I\u2019ve ever been a part of. It\u2019s all about speed, it doesn\u2019t matter if you do five seconds on the front or 40 seconds on the front. The team that rotates the speed the best, wins. It\u2019s a real buzz, it is something else to be a part of. It\u2019s like being a racing driver in F1, that\u2019s what it feels to be a part of an elite cycling team, although our job is a bit harder. His unexpected reign at the top of the standings continues! They also have Wout van Aert in the mix for the GC. What a start to the Tour. Steven Kruijswijk, sitting in fourth, was a little bit ragged as Jumbo-Visma come up the home straight but the experienced Tony Martin helps him over the line. Fists are raised into the air in celebration as their victory is confirmed with a time 28 minutes and 57 seconds \u2013 20 seconds clear of Team Ineos. Jim Ratcliffe, your boys took one hell of a beating. Mike Teunissen, the first Dutch rider to wear the yellow rider since 1989, is third of the five remaining Jumbo-Visma riders. About two kilometres to go, they will surely win this stage, barring any crashes. Deceuninck\u2013Quick-Step are right in it as they approach the final kilometre. They were just two seconds behind the fastest time at the second checkpoint and could well usurp Team Ineos at the top of the standings! Five riders, led by Julian Alaphilippe, are hurtling down the home straight, which is a slight incline. Alaphilippe is really grimacing \u2026 ooooooh, they finish just 0.82 seconds behind Ineos! Deceuninck\u2013Quick-Step slot into second place. The British team retain the TTT lead, then, although it looks like Jumbo-Visma \u2013 our last team out on the course \u2013 will ultimately win the day. They are now 14 seconds clear of everyone else as they fly through the second checkpoint. This is a staggering performance from Jumbo-Visma, who are going so fast that they have actually dropped one of their riders. They are still seven men strong though, and that should be OK for the latter stages. It\u2019s looking like it is going to be a straight shoot out between Jumbo-Visma and Team Inoes. Great news for the wearer of the yellow jersey Mike Teunissen. Jumbo Visma are a full 11 seconds ahead of Team Katusha Alpecin time! Wow! EF Education First are fading slightly, but should be in the mix for a podium spot. Two km for them to go. Rohan Dennis is really coming into his own here for Nibali and Bahrain-Merida, powering them through the final two kilometres. Nibali is the first through the finish line, 14 seconds behind Ineos\u2019s time. That\u2019s not too bad, a good ride. You would say that the only teams that look like they could challenge Ineos for the stage win here are Jumbo-Visma, EF Education First and Deceuninck Quick Step, who have just gone through the first checkpoint just one second off the Team Katusha Alpecin time, which places them ahead of Ineos at this stage. Bahrain-Merida and Vincenzo Nibali, meanwhile, are just two kilometres from the finish. They were 12 seconds adrift of Team Katusha Alpecin at the second checkpoint, so Nibali is well positioned for the GC. The final team to get off the starting blocks, Jumbo-Visma, who include our wearer of the yellow jersey, Mike Teunissen. Wout van Aert and the legendary Tony Martin help make up a formidable TTT line-up. I expect them to win this stage today, which would of course keep Teunissen in the yellow jersey. Not the best ride for Michelton-Scott, who go through the second checkpoint in sixth place. They will hope to at least break the top five by the finish. Peter Sagan and Bora\u2013Hansgrohe finish 25 seconds behind Ineos, which is about par for the team. Sagan will want to get hold of that yellow jersey at some point after missing out yesterday. And here\u2019s Porte to discuss Trek\u2013Segafredo\u2019s poor performance. It was a really fast course. Ineos are a the team to beat, but the race is far from done. We did a really good ride with what we\u2019ve got. Knowing what the Pyrenees and the Alps, it\u2019s going to be tough. I\u2019m not going to throw the toys out of the cot just yet. The climbing stages are coming and there\u2019s still a long way to go. I\u2019m a big fan too, although I wouldn\u2019t mind it if it the stage came a bit later in the schedule. It\u2019s disappointing that GC riders like Porte or Bardet are effectively out of the running because of the rest of the their team\u2019s showing here in the TTT. But hey, that\u2019s cycling. Lotto Soudal are looking quick, if a little ragged, with two of their riders dropping off BEFORE the first checkpoint. That said, they go through in 14\u201908\u2019\u2019, just 12 seconds off Team Katusha Alpecin\u2019s time, and the riders regroup. I wonder if that recovery will have taken something out of the tank for the last half of the course. Jakob Fuglsang, one of the GC contenders that sustained a nasty crash yesterday, has been talking to the cameras. His team, Astana, currently lie in fifth place today. I\u2019m quite happy with it. The team did a decent time trial. I\u2019m happy that I could also turn with the guys. We worked hard to get ready and I was able to battle it out without too much pain. I was of course tired in the head [after he hit his head in yesterday] but today I am OK. It\u2019s the leg that is causing me problems and unfortunately that\u2019s what you need in the Tour. Two of the strongest time trial teams, Sunweb and Adam Yates\u2019s Mitchelton\u2013Scott, are still in the mix. Sunweb are six seconds off the pace through the first checkpoint, while Mitchelton\u2013Scott are just rolling out of the starting blocks. Team Katusha Alpecin just drop short of Team Ineos, fading in the final metres and finishing with a time of 29\u201924\u2019\u2019, just five seconds short of the British leaders! That would have been a real upset, but the Swiss side can be delighted with their day\u2019s work. Team Katusha Alpecin, down to six riders as they approach the final kilometre, are right on Team Ineos\u2019s time! This is going to come down right to the wire on the finish line! Of all the GC riders, Porte (and Bardet?) has had the worst time trial. Trek-Segafredo finish a full 58 seconds behind Inoes, which could be a devastating blow for the Australian. Sagan, our green jersey winner who missed out on the yellow jersey yesterday to Mike Teunissen by a matter of inches, is out on the course with his Bora\u2013Hansgrohe team-mates. It goes from bad to worse for Porte and Trek-Segafredo, who go through the second checkpoint 41 seconds off the pace. You would not expect them to be outside Movistar or UAE, but here they are. Team Katusha Alpecin fly out of the traps, and the first split have the Swiss side leading Team Ineos, going through the first checkpoint in 13\u201955\u2019\u2019 four seconds quicker than the British side. Let\u2019s see if they can keep things up. CCC team \u2013 also time trial specialists \u2013 fare a lot better and finish in 29\u201929\u2019, just usurping Groupama\u2013FDJ into second place! Ritchie Porte and Trek\u2013Segafredo \u2013 who are normally time trial specialists \u2013 are a good 29 seconds behind Ineos as they go through the first checkpoint. That\u2019s a disappointing result, but the truth is that this team are not as strong as years gone by. Movistar, led by Alejandro Valverde and Nairo Quinata finish the TTT in 30\u201903, a good 45 seconds back from Ineos. Funnily enough, the riders look happy with that result and seem to be congratulating each other before disembarking from the saddle. It\u2019s a long way back for Quintana in particular, especially as we won\u2019t really get near any mountains for a few more days. It\u2019s been confirmed that David Gaudu was the Groupama-FDJ rider that crashed as the team came around the final bends. It was a heavy fall but Gaudu was able to get to his feet. He\u2019s the No 2 rider for Groupama-FDJ after Pinot so the French team will be hoping that he is OK. These are the top three as things stand. You can\u2019t win the Tour with the team time trial, but you can certainly lose it. AG2R La Mondiale finish 59 seconds behind Ineos\u2019s time in 30\u201917\u2019\u2019. Bardet\u2019s GC hopes could well be over before it\u2019s really begun. It\u2019s going to be so tough for him to make up a minute on the leaders. With Groupama-FDJ just 10 seconds off and Astana 20 seconds off (with an injured rider), it is increasingly looking like Ineos\u2019s time of 29\u201918\u2019\u2019 isn\u2019t actually a brilliant time. By the time that stage favourites Jumbo-Visma and Team Sunweb finish, they could well be outside the top five. Movistar are 38 seconds down as they roll through the second checkpoint. Quintana and co are having a shocker. Crash for Groupama-FDJ! One rider \u2013 not Pinot \u2013 goes down hard as they approach a tight corner in the final kilometre but the Frenchman and his team are lucky that the crash is at the back so that it doesn\u2019t impede the rest of the riders. Pinot finishes first as the team finish just 10 seconds off Ineos\u2019s pace. 29\u201929\u2019\u2019 is an excellent result. Fair play to Astana, they have rallied in the second part of that race and finish with a very respectable 29\u201938\u2019\u2019. That\u2019s 20 seconds off the pace of Ineos, so a small amount of time for Fuglsang to make up, but considering they were 14 seconds down at the half-way stage, the losses are not too great. Compare that to Team Ark\u00e9a\u2013Samsic, who finished a full 1min30secs behind Ineos\u2019s time. Ouch. Thomas is caught by someone with a microphone as Team Ineos walk off the course. He\u2019s asked if they were happy with an average speed of 56km/hour. \u201cI wanted to go 57km/h. I think we rode well actually. Can\u2019t be too disappointed with that. Thomas is then asked if starting first was deliberate. No it wasn\u2019t deliberately. It was my little tumble and the fact that Egan was behind me \u2013 we had someone in front. It does indeed look like Fuglsang\u2019s crash is taking its toll. Nairo Quintana is now out on the course with the rest of his Movistar team. They are not expected to challenge here for the stage win, I expect they will be happy to have their time settle in the middle of the pack. That time is actually in line with their first split at the checkpoint, so interesting that they didn\u2019t actually get quicker at the course went on. Maybe the wind changed or something. Kwiatkowski peels off as Ineos approach the final 250 metres. It\u2019s a slightly uphill finish, and the riders look like they are really hurting here. Thomas is at the front, but the time will be dictated by the fourth rider \u2026 Wout Poels and (I think) Luke Rowe are the first two Inoes riders to drop off the pace. Poels is predominantly a climber and will be saving his energy for the mountains. 1km to go for the Team Ineos. Astana are the next team to fly through the first checkpoint, they are 14.38 seconds behind the time of Team Ineos. I would expect that to grow as the race continues. Five km to go for Ineos. They are flying down a wide boulevard at 67km/hour. Woof! Interesting that Ineos still have their eight riders together. Teams almost never finish with their eight all bunched up \u2013 remember it\u2019s only the top four riders which share the overall time \u2013 but it will be interesting to see if they keep this up. Team Ineos are through the first checkpoint (after 13.2km) in 13 minutes, 59 seconds. That\u2019s an average speed of 56km/hour, which is very, very quick even for elite level riding. Expect that to go up, the fastest sections of the course are towards the end. Thibaut Pinot is looking very relaxed as he gets onto his bike. France is craving a home winner and him and Bardet may not have a better chance to win the Tour than this year. Pinot is all business as his Groupama -FDJ team line up on the starting block. Bardet and AG2R La Mondiale will follow shortly. Astana are the next team off the block: Fuglsang is there looking very determined. The crowds are going mad, fair play to the Belgians and everyone that has travelled out there. I\u2019m going out in a week or so to go and watch it at the Col du Tourmalet, can\u2019t wait! \u201cWaiting in the bois du cambre for the first team to arrive,\u201d emails Annie Collins. \u201cFabulous atmosphere!\u201d There are two checkpoints to gauge the 22 teams\u2019 progress \u2013 the first at Le Bois de Cambre is after 13.2km, the second at Boulevard G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Wahis is after 20.1km and the finish line after 27.6km at the Atomium, which was originally constructed for the 1958 Brussels World\u2019s Fair but it now a museum. Fun fact: the Atomium consists of nine spheres, representing an iron crystal magnified 150 billion times. Thomas, Bernal and co lead off. It\u2019s dry in Brussels today and a mild 19 degrees with a light breeze. This is going to be very fast, but it\u2019s not a hugely technical course in terms of braking and turning. Van Baarle is out at the front, Thomas at the back. They are actually in a perfect reverse order from eight to one. Thomas and the rest of Team Ineos have warming up on the exercise bike \u2013 sort of like a spinning class \u2013 but they are ready on the starting line. David Millar, ITV4 commentator, seems to think that Ineos finishing last yesterday was actually a deliberate ploy to have an element of control today. I\u2019m not so sure. Still, Millar has been out inspecting the course today \u2013 he says that the road surface is exceptionally smooth and \u201ca dream course\u201d for the leading teams that have marginal gains in aerodynamics and equipment. For French rider and GC contender Romain Bardet, this will be one of damage limitation. The Ag2r-La Mondiale rider is a big climber, and this year\u2019s race has been billed as the highest ever, but today might be a struggle for him. Fuglsang has been talking this morning. I\u2019m definitely not 100%, that\u2019s for sure, but better than I thought. I was feeling yesterday that I would slowly turn down. We will see once we start racing. Our first email comes from Lyn Whitfield, who is in Brussels! \u201cIn Brussels and standing on one of the boulevards by the European Parliament. Publicity caravan has just gone through at 40mph, chucking metal keyrings and other merch at the crowd\u2019s legs at some velocity. All quite surreal... looking forward to some actual racing. Dutch very excited; lots of flags out with the name of yesterday\u2019s winner hastily added in permanent marker ...\u201d This was Fuglsang\u2019s crash, you can see him in the turquoise jersey going down hard on the pavement on the right hand side as he falls over Bahrain-Merida\u2019s Damiano Caruso, who was already down. Some excellent agility from Caruso\u2019s team-mate Jan Tratnik (not Nibali, as stated in the above tweet \u2013 you can see the Italian on the left hand side looking back at this team-mates in horror) sees the Slovenian avoid the crash. Hop! Just a little reminder of how the team time trial works. Eight riders from each team go off at the same time and the first four to finish will all be awarded the same time, so there\u2019s no glory in one rider going off in a hurry. Teamwork and tactics will be vital to ensure that nobody from the four are left behind. The last four will have their times clocked individually. Jumbo-Visma, Team Sunweb, Mitchelton-Scott and Bahrain-Merida are expected to be among the strongest teams for the time trial. Our unexpected wearer of the yellow jersey, Mike Teunissen, is part of the Jumbo Visma team, who are my pick to win here today, so the Dutch rider could well extend his team at the top and keep the maillot jaune into the third day. Team Ineos will be keen to make up for yesterday. Geraint Thomas is a good time trial rider, Bernal less so, but the British team could well be in the mix here as well. Thomas\u2019s crash yesterday was just a minor one, other riders meant he went down after a glancing blow from the barriers, about 3km from the end. Thomas himself said it just a topple \u2013 he\u2019s on the right-hand side in the below video \u2013 so he\u2019ll be fully fit for today. Things are looking a bit more dicey for another of the GC favourites, Astana Pro Team rider Jakob Fuglsang, who had a much bigger crash. The Dane finished the race but had to be given assistance as he hobbled away after his post-race interviews. He took a bang on the knee and a nasty cut above his right eye. It will be interesting to see what shape he\u2019s in today after an evening with the medics. Welcome to the second stage of the Tour. It\u2019s the time trial today, around Brussels, as the Tour continues to pay homage to Belgian Eddy Merckx. There was a huge crowd yesterday to greet the 74-year-old before Stage One started, and that obviously inspired Belgium\u2019s Greg Van Avermaet, who was the first to the summit ahead of Meurisse to take two bonus points and the King of the Mountains jersey. It was an action-packed tour, complete with a crash for Geraint Thomas and a photo finish involving Peter Sagan and the eventual stage winner, Mike Teunissen, our yellow jersey winner. Peter Whittle was in Brussels for the Guardian \u2013 read his report here: All that means that this is the currently running order for today\u2019s time trial. With Egan Bernal and Thomas both caught up in the crash yesterday, Team Ineos lies at the bottom of the team classification and it is them that will start first at 1.30pm BST, 2.30pm local time. All times below are BST. 1.30 \u2013 Team Ineos 1.35 \u2013 Ark\u00e9a \u2013 Samsic 1.40 \u2013 Astana 1.45 \u2013 Groupama \u2013 FDJ 1.50 \u2013 AG2R La Mondiale 1.55 \u2013 Movistar 2.00 \u2013 Total Direct Energie 2.05 \u2013 CCC 2.10 \u2013 UAE Emirates 2.15 \u2013 Trek-Segafredo 2.20 \u2013 Katusha-Alpecin 2.25 \u2013 Cofidis 2.30 \u2013 Dimension Data 2.35 \u2013 Team Sunweb 2.40 \u2013 BORA-hansgrohe 2.45 \u2013 Lotto Soudal 2.50 \u2013 Mitchelton \u2013 Scott 2.55 \u2013 Bahrain Merida 3.00 \u2013 EF Education First 3.05 \u2013 Deceuninck \u2013 Quick-Step 3.10 \u2013 Wanty \u2013 Gobert 3.15 \u2013 Jumbo \u2013 Visma This is the course today, 27.6km, wide, flat roads (four \u2018climbs\u2019 of around just 4%), so it should be a very quick one. Obviously we won\u2019t have the jostling of yesterday, so please do chime in with your emails, tweets, hopes and dreams. You can find me at michael.butler@theguardian.com or @michaelbutler18.",

He says: \u201cThe pollster John Curtice says that this this not just a issue of party members. It is question of the whole of British politics \u2013 that what was once a bell shape has turned into a U shape in which the extremes are popular.\u201d \u201cCurtice would essentially say that I am fishing in a very shallow pool. I am not sure that is true or how permanent this state is.\u201d He insists he will resign as international development secretary if Johnson wins. \u201cUnfortunately, the first thing that happens if Johnson wins is that I will lose my job, even though my last nine years had been spent building up to this.\u201d Instead, he says he will restart his \u201cRory walks\u201d tours around the country, retelling conversation into an iPhone in social media messages that sometimes reach hundreds of thousands of people. He admits, with his trademark candour: \u201cI am still thinking this through.\u201d",

Analysis by the Guardian found that debenture seats, which cost \u00a380,000 for a five-year period, are being sold for thousands of pounds per match. Some of the listings, including for the ladies\u2019 and men\u2019s finals on Centre Court, display no seat numbers, making it impossible for buyers to know what they\u2019re paying for. The Competitions and Markets Authority (CMA) said earlier this week it was seeking to find Viagogo in contempt of court for alleged repeated breaches of a court order the regulator obtained against the company last year, including failure to provide seat numbers. But Viagogo said it was not obliged to provide such information for Wimbledon because even though seat numbers have now been allocated, they had not been when the tickets were issued to debenture holders and listed on its website. However, similar listings on rival StubHub do include seat numbers. The CMA\u2019s court order also requires Viagogo to provide accurate information on the person selling the ticket, so they can contact the seller in case of any problem. But sellers\u2019 details attached to listings seen by the Guardian include one with a postcode that does not match the given address and another with a generic company name that appears to have no connection to the given address, a PO Box in Amsterdam.

But, without some intervention to ensure that the indigenous films still get developed and made, you end up having a new set of studios dominating the world.</p> <p>\u201cI am passionate about producing, but I am horrified at the way this country develops and treats its producing talent. We\u2019re becoming an industry focused only on servicing the colossal range of inward investment films and TV series attracted by the tax credit, the dollar and working here, or making the very low-budget films from emerging directors, which are really all the British Film Institute (BFI) and BBC Films can afford to do.\u201d</p> <p>He said the UK would look back within a few years on how it destroyed the independent film sector, depriving cinema audiences of original and diverse films in which the UK has always excelled.</p> <p>He is calling for a shake-up of the industry in a world after the Brexit vote, where everything is changing, saying: \u201cAre we going to let British creators just work for America?\u201d</p> <p>His concerns were echoed by Rebecca O\u2019Brien, producer of Ken Loach\u2019s films, who said: \u201cI\u2019m quite pessimistic for the independent sector at the moment.</p> <p>\u201cI certainly see a decline \u2026 The success of the inward investment business, which of course the industry is delighted to have, because it keeps strong employment is definitely a problem for the independent sector, who can\u2019t pay so well.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re crewing a film, it\u2019s really quite difficult to find people \u2026 People that we work with might be employed for up to nine months on a studio production and they have to commit to it because independent productions are rare \u2026 So it does begin to drill a hole in our ability to keep the sector going.\u201d</p> <p>Gabrielle Stewart, the managing director of HanWay Films, whose productions include Ralph Fiennes\u2019s Rudolf Nureyev drama, The White Crow, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a lot tougher right now.\u201d</p> <p>Beyond tax relief, which provides about 20% of a production budget if the entire film is made in the UK, British producers have traditionally competed for public funds from the BFI and BBC Films and for a UK distributor to put a substantial guarantee against UK revenues.</p> <p>Paterson said: \u201c\u00a311m for BBC Films and about \u00a315m for the BFI. These are pathetic numbers compared to the billions that Netflix and others spend. We don\u2019t need to spend that level of money to compete because we\u2019re really good at making films \u2026 Audiences want films in their cinemas that are not just more of the same.\u201d</p> <p>A BBC Films spokeswoman acknowledged that its budget was small, but said it was used judiciously, supporting both new and established film-makers.</p> <p>Ben Roberts, the deputy chief executive of the BFI, said the independent film sector remained buoyant, with plenty of actors wanting to fit those productions into their schedules.</p> <p>Noting \u201cthe incredible energy\u201d of the inward investment sector, he said: \u201cI\u2019m naturally more optimistic. We see a lot of work coming into us as an open access funder every year. It would be a shame to paint a picture of negativity.\u201d</p>",

We\u2019re not for a second saying we don\u2019t love that \u2026 It\u2019s an awful lot easier to make movies for Netflix, where they pay for it, than it is to bring 50 different bits of money together to make The Railway Man. But, without some intervention to ensure that the indigenous films still get developed and made, you end up having a new set of studios dominating the world. \u201cI am passionate about producing, but I am horrified at the way this country develops and treats its producing talent. We\u2019re becoming an industry focused only on servicing the colossal range of inward investment films and TV series attracted by the tax credit, the dollar and working here, or making the very low-budget films from emerging directors, which are really all the British Film Institute (BFI) and BBC Films can afford to do.\u201d He said the UK would look back within a few years on how it destroyed the independent film sector, depriving cinema audiences of original and diverse films in which the UK has always excelled. He is calling for a shake-up of the industry in a world after the Brexit vote, where everything is changing, saying: \u201cAre we going to let British creators just work for America?\u201d His concerns were echoed by Rebecca O\u2019Brien, producer of Ken Loach\u2019s films, who said: \u201cI\u2019m quite pessimistic for the independent sector at the moment. \u201cI certainly see a decline \u2026 The success of the inward investment business, which of course the industry is delighted to have, because it keeps strong employment is definitely a problem for the independent sector, who can\u2019t pay so well. \u201cWhen you\u2019re crewing a film, it\u2019s really quite difficult to find people \u2026 People that we work with might be employed for up to nine months on a studio production and they have to commit to it because independent productions are rare \u2026 So it does begin to drill a hole in our ability to keep the sector going.\u201d Gabrielle Stewart, the managing director of HanWay Films, whose productions include Ralph Fiennes\u2019s Rudolf Nureyev drama, The White Crow, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a lot tougher right now.\u201d Beyond tax relief, which provides about 20% of a production budget if the entire film is made in the UK, British producers have traditionally competed for public funds from the BFI and BBC Films and for a UK distributor to put a substantial guarantee against UK revenues. Paterson said: \u201c\u00a311m for BBC Films and about \u00a315m for the BFI. These are pathetic numbers compared to the billions that Netflix and others spend. We don\u2019t need to spend that level of money to compete because we\u2019re really good at making films \u2026 Audiences want films in their cinemas that are not just more of the same.\u201d A BBC Films spokeswoman acknowledged that its budget was small, but said it was used judiciously, supporting both new and established film-makers. Ben Roberts, the deputy chief executive of the BFI, said the independent film sector remained buoyant, with plenty of actors wanting to fit those productions into their schedules. Noting \u201cthe incredible energy\u201d of the inward investment sector, he said: \u201cI\u2019m naturally more optimistic. We see a lot of work coming into us as an open access funder every year. It would be a shame to paint a picture of negativity.\u201d",

A year on and she has grown into an athlete with speed to burn. Some of the balls she reached against Williams and Hercog almost defied belief and she moves so well her quickness rattles her opponents, who often go for broke fearing she will run them down. Serena Williams pointed out the similarities between Gauff and Venus, from the way they played to the way they move, and if Gauff is half the athlete Venus has been over two decades on tour, she will have a great career. \u201cVery fit,\u201d as Hercog said, succinctly. Also her powerful legs are the springboard for her serve, her smash and everything she does.</p> <h2><strong>Heart</strong></h2> <p>Gauff\u2019s match against Hercog should be a reference point whenever people ask how much she wants to succeed. Down a set and 5-2, she dug deep, saving two match points \u2013 one at 5-2 and another at 5-3 \u2013 and then, having let slip a 4-1 lead in the deciding set as Hercog recovered her poise, she pushed on again for the win. This is a girl who really wants to win, loves playing, loves competing and will try her best on every single point, the kind of attitude we see from Rafael Nadal. The former French Open champion Iva Majoli, who also played her first grand slam match shortly after her 15th birthday, said desire was the key to success at a young age. \u201cYou can see her passion for the game, you can see she really wants it badly, it\u2019s admirable,\u201d Majoli said. \u201cIt brings back a lot of memories, I think she just works very hard and it\u2019s showing.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Mental strength</strong></h2> <p>When Gauff learned she was going to play Venus Williams in the first round, Patrick Mouratoglou \u2013 the coach of Serena Williams who has known and worked with the 15-year-old for a few years \u2013 was delighted to see the excitement in her eyes. She was not overwhelmed, or disappointed at not getting a \u201clesser\u201d player on her grand slam debut, she knew it was an opportunity. Although she gets excited on court at the big moments, she is generally incredibly calm, allowing her to play her best tennis when needed. Hercog said: \u201cShe\u2019s probably older in her head than the numbers show. She\u2019s very young and she has the mentality to do it.\u201d And as Mouratoglou said, she had been prepared for this moment for many years. \u201cI can feel the pressure that she has,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that she doesn\u2019t care about it, she feels it but you can see that she finds a way to deal with it \u2026 which is amazing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e013f6875b56a529bd4d9fb9758751c905416652\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e013f6875b56a529bd4d9fb9758751c905416652/292_116_3087_1852/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coco Gauff\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coco Gauff, arriving to practise on Sunday, has looked comfortable at Wimbledon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steven Paston/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Star power</strong></h2> <p>The BBC releases its TV peak viewing figures after each day of the championships and even though Roger Federer, Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams have been front and centre, it has been the efforts of Gauff that have had most people on the edge of their seats.

It helps, of course, that she has been playing her matches in the late afternoon/early evening, but that is just because American TV is requesting she play late, an indication of her pulling power. With sponsorship deals worth $1m this year alone, she is going to be very wealthy, if her tennis keeps improving at the current rate.

The chances are, if Brexit goes through, a nodeal Brexit, it is going to be the end of Northern Ireland\u2019s union with the United Kingdom, with serious political consequences flowing from it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Grieve said that was why it was \u201cperfectly legitimate\u201d to use the bill to ensure MPs got the chance to debate the consequences of a no-deal Brexit.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b146305d-32c1-4dc9-9f4d-b60ce025264f\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If the UK leaves the EU without a deal it would by default, become a \u201cthird country\u201d, with no overarching post-Brexit plan in place and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.</p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europeif there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The backbencher did not give details of his proposed amendment, but it is understood it would force the government to make an oral statement to the Commons in October on progress towards restoring the power-sharing executive \u2013 a move that would stop the new prime minister proroguing parliament for September and October, to stop MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit.

      "bodyText": "MPs opposed to a no-deal Brexit may try to force a vote on a Northern Ireland bill to stop the next prime minister proroguing parliament in the autumn, Dominic Grieve has confirmed. Grieve, a former attorney general who has played a leading role in limiting what Brexit policy ministers can implement without parliamentary approval, said the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation) bill could be the next opportunity for a Conservative rebellion. He was speaking as another former minister said there were \u201c30-plus\u201d Conservatives willing to defy the whip to prevent the UK leaving the EU without a deal later this year. Theresa May ultimately baulked at the prospect of trying to implement no deal, but both her two potential successors, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, have said they would if necessary pursue this option, with Johnson committed to deliver Brexit by 31 October \u201cdo or die\u201d. On Monday, MPs will debate the second reading of the Northern Ireland bill, which will extend until October, and potentially January 2020, the deadline set for the resumption of the power-sharing executive in Northern Ireland. All remaining stages of the bill are due to be debated in the Commons on another day. Speaking on Radio 5 Live, Grieve said: \u201cNorthern Ireland and Brexit go rather closely together. The chances are, if Brexit goes through, a nodeal Brexit, it is going to be the end of Northern Ireland\u2019s union with the United Kingdom, with serious political consequences flowing from it.\u201d Grieve said that was why it was \u201cperfectly legitimate\u201d to use the bill to ensure MPs got the chance to debate the consequences of a no-deal Brexit. The backbencher did not give details of his proposed amendment, but it is understood it would force the government to make an oral statement to the Commons in October on progress towards restoring the power-sharing executive \u2013 a move that would stop the new prime minister proroguing parliament for September and October, to stop MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit. Hunt is opposed to use prorogation for this purpose, but Johnson has not ruled it out. In a separate interview, Sam Gyimah, another Conservative former minister, said there were about \u201c30-plus\u201d Tories willing to join him in defying the whip to vote against a no-deal Brexit. Gyimah said he did not intend to vote against his government on a no-confidence motion for this purpose \u2013 even though some commentators believe that this could end up being the only option available for Tories determined to scupper a no deal. He added he and his colleagues were considering \u201ca number of legislative mechanisms\u201d that might be available. David Gauke, the justice secretary and another Tory firmly opposed to a no-deal Brexit, told the BBC that, although the parliamentary options for MPs determined to block this option seemed limited, he thought the Speaker, John Bercow, would be willing to ignore precedent to help them out. \u201cIn a world where we have a Speaker who is perhaps prepared to be innovative, when there is a clear majority in parliament that is against no deal, you have to question whether [the 2016 referendum] provides a mandate for leaving without a deal \u2013 so with all those facts, I think parliament will find a way through,\u201d Gauke said. One option for the rebel MPs might be to use an emergency debate, scheduled under standing order 24, to pass a business motion that would allow backbenchers to take control of the Commons business for a day to allow legislation blocking no deal to be passed.

      "body": "<p>The Britain of 2019 is very different from the Britain of 1964, the year I started my journalistic career. Among the most obvious changes are those of social class and ethnicity. A country in which the largest social group was both working class and white has been transformed.</p> <p>Naturally enough, these developments have affected the makeup of our media, but in different ways. Journalism has become an almost uniformly middle-class trade in which entrants are usually expected to have enjoyed a degree-level education. By contrast, running counter to the rise in the BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) population, media recruitment has not kept pace with that increase. It is assumed that the lack of working class and BAME media representation distorts output. I concede it may be unproven, or possibly unprovable, but I am convinced it is so. In their heyday, popular newspapers, which were overwhelmingly staffed by white working-class journalists, reflected the concerns and, yes, the prejudices, of the communities from which they sprang.</p> <p>There is a world of difference between empathising with people and sharing the same experiences as them. Perhaps it took the huge working-class vote in favour of Brexit for a middle-class media to realise its distance from reality.</p> <p>Many editors across the media spectrum \u2013 newspapers, broadcasters and online \u2013 have recognised the need to address the narrowing demographic intake. <a href=\"https://academy.news.co.uk/\" title=\"\">News UK, with its academy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/education/standard-teams-up-with-pa-to-launch-journalism-apprenticeships-a3875206.html\" title=\"\">the London Evening Standard, with its apprenticeship scheme</a>, and the Guardian, with its <a href=\"https://workforus.theguardian.com/index.php/entry-level-opportunities/scott-trust-bursaries/\">Scott Trust bursaries</a>, <a href=\"https://workforus.theguardian.com/index.php/entry-level-opportunities/positive-action-scheme/\">Positive Action Scheme</a> and <a href=\"https://workforus.theguardian.com/index.php/entry-level-opportunities/trainee-sub-editor-scheme/\">sub-editor traineeships</a>, are among those organisations that have sought to give young people from diverse social and ethnic backgrounds a start in journalism.</p> <p>Now come two new initiatives with somewhat similar aims, one designed to improve the life chances of working-class people who are passionate about journalism, especially those who live outside England\u2019s south-east, and another aimed at improving the perception of Britain\u2019s Muslim citizens.</p> <h2><strong>Getting a foot in the door</strong></h2> <p>Following the murder in April of the Northern Ireland freelance journalist Lyra McKee, the Centre for Investigative Journalism (CIJ) swiftly created a bursary in her memory. It offered to train people from underprivileged backgrounds \u201cwho aspire to become journalists or who are journalists at the very early stages of their career\u201d.</p> <p>In announcing the bursary, the CIJ said it was \u201cinspired by Lyra\u2019s determination to become an investigative journalist, despite personal disability, the need to care for her disabled mother as well as fighting the in-built bias against working-class entrants to journalism\u201d. It contended that \u201ctoo often \u2026 internships go to well-connected, well-heeled young people. As a result, the higher echelons of the national media risk being made up largely of those who lack sources within and any experience in common with wider society.\u201d</p> <p>So, it sought \u201cbright people without access to London media connections\u201d. Last week, the first 11 beneficiaries of the scheme \u2013 including people from Derry, Belfast, Glasgow and Bristol \u2013 attended the CIJ\u2019s investigative conference at Goldsmiths, University of London. There, they heard from Lyra\u2019s sister, Nichola, that the McKee family would fund the bursary\u2019s fourth year. The Lorana Sullivan Foundation is paying for the initial three years.</p> <p>Next comes an opportunity for the students to attend a series of masterclasses in investigative journalism under the leadership of Stephen Grey, a Reuters special correspondent with a wealth of reporting experience. They will join other applicants on the course, which is due to be run on five successive Saturdays in the autumn.</p> <p>Grey and his fellow tutors will teach lessons in a range of subjects, such as the handling of sources and how to analyse data. He says: \u201cIt\u2019s much more difficult to get a foot in the journalistic door nowadays. There\u2019s a barrier to access for those without qualifications or for those who live outside London. Even for staff in regional papers, it\u2019s difficult to get a start on national media without some kind of connection. We are offering places on the course, free of charge, to people who have demonstrated a commitment to truth-telling journalism, whether in local or regional media, or blogs and new media.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Gross misrepresentation</strong></h2> <p>Of all the BAME groups, it is Muslims who have suffered some of the most hostile media coverage in recent years. According to Paul Salahuddin Armstrong, managing director of the Association of British Muslims (AoBM), the negative portrayal of his community on screen amounts to \u201ca gross misrepresentation of the greater Muslim population\u201d.</p> <p>Waseem Mahmood, a strategic communications consultant who has set up broadcasting projects in various countries specifically aimed at combating terrorism, agrees: \u201cWe suffer from negative coverage which fuels Islamophobia.\u201d</p> <p>To try to counter the surfeit of biased narratives about Muslims, his son, Khurrum, came up with the idea of creating an advisory body to ensure that film producers and script writers depict Muslims with greater accuracy and fairness. So, he approached the AoBM and the result is the founding of the Film and Television Bureau.</p> <p>Khurrum, an award-winning film-maker himself, says: \u201cWe want to act as a consultation service for film and television projects.

      "bodyText": "The Britain of 2019 is very different from the Britain of 1964, the year I started my journalistic career. Among the most obvious changes are those of social class and ethnicity. A country in which the largest social group was both working class and white has been transformed. Naturally enough, these developments have affected the makeup of our media, but in different ways. Journalism has become an almost uniformly middle-class trade in which entrants are usually expected to have enjoyed a degree-level education. By contrast, running counter to the rise in the BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) population, media recruitment has not kept pace with that increase. It is assumed that the lack of working class and BAME media representation distorts output. I concede it may be unproven, or possibly unprovable, but I am convinced it is so. In their heyday, popular newspapers, which were overwhelmingly staffed by white working-class journalists, reflected the concerns and, yes, the prejudices, of the communities from which they sprang. There is a world of difference between empathising with people and sharing the same experiences as them. Perhaps it took the huge working-class vote in favour of Brexit for a middle-class media to realise its distance from reality. Many editors across the media spectrum \u2013 newspapers, broadcasters and online \u2013 have recognised the need to address the narrowing demographic intake. News UK, with its academy, the London Evening Standard, with its apprenticeship scheme, and the Guardian, with its Scott Trust bursaries, Positive Action Scheme and sub-editor traineeships, are among those organisations that have sought to give young people from diverse social and ethnic backgrounds a start in journalism. Now come two new initiatives with somewhat similar aims, one designed to improve the life chances of working-class people who are passionate about journalism, especially those who live outside England\u2019s south-east, and another aimed at improving the perception of Britain\u2019s Muslim citizens. Getting a foot in the door Following the murder in April of the Northern Ireland freelance journalist Lyra McKee, the Centre for Investigative Journalism (CIJ) swiftly created a bursary in her memory. It offered to train people from underprivileged backgrounds \u201cwho aspire to become journalists or who are journalists at the very early stages of their career\u201d. In announcing the bursary, the CIJ said it was \u201cinspired by Lyra\u2019s determination to become an investigative journalist, despite personal disability, the need to care for her disabled mother as well as fighting the in-built bias against working-class entrants to journalism\u201d. It contended that \u201ctoo often \u2026 internships go to well-connected, well-heeled young people. As a result, the higher echelons of the national media risk being made up largely of those who lack sources within and any experience in common with wider society.\u201d So, it sought \u201cbright people without access to London media connections\u201d. Last week, the first 11 beneficiaries of the scheme \u2013 including people from Derry, Belfast, Glasgow and Bristol \u2013 attended the CIJ\u2019s investigative conference at Goldsmiths, University of London. There, they heard from Lyra\u2019s sister, Nichola, that the McKee family would fund the bursary\u2019s fourth year. The Lorana Sullivan Foundation is paying for the initial three years. Next comes an opportunity for the students to attend a series of masterclasses in investigative journalism under the leadership of Stephen Grey, a Reuters special correspondent with a wealth of reporting experience. They will join other applicants on the course, which is due to be run on five successive Saturdays in the autumn. Grey and his fellow tutors will teach lessons in a range of subjects, such as the handling of sources and how to analyse data. He says: \u201cIt\u2019s much more difficult to get a foot in the journalistic door nowadays. There\u2019s a barrier to access for those without qualifications or for those who live outside London. Even for staff in regional papers, it\u2019s difficult to get a start on national media without some kind of connection. We are offering places on the course, free of charge, to people who have demonstrated a commitment to truth-telling journalism, whether in local or regional media, or blogs and new media.\u201d Gross misrepresentation Of all the BAME groups, it is Muslims who have suffered some of the most hostile media coverage in recent years. According to Paul Salahuddin Armstrong, managing director of the Association of British Muslims (AoBM), the negative portrayal of his community on screen amounts to \u201ca gross misrepresentation of the greater Muslim population\u201d. Waseem Mahmood, a strategic communications consultant who has set up broadcasting projects in various countries specifically aimed at combating terrorism, agrees: \u201cWe suffer from negative coverage which fuels Islamophobia.\u201d To try to counter the surfeit of biased narratives about Muslims, his son, Khurrum, came up with the idea of creating an advisory body to ensure that film producers and script writers depict Muslims with greater accuracy and fairness. So, he approached the AoBM and the result is the founding of the Film and Television Bureau. Khurrum, an award-winning film-maker himself, says: \u201cWe want to act as a consultation service for film and television projects. We\u2019re ready to work from the script stage through to on set.\u201d He wants the bureau to engage a panel of consultants and scholars who can assist producers with a range of issues, from theological questions to historical dress. Authenticity, he believes, will redress the unsympathetic image currently prevalent in both TV and movie productions touching on Muslims. He also believes the bureau could help to cure the lack of diversity and inclusion within the film industry. This ambition dovetails with the CIJ\u2019s Lyra McKee undertaking and is informed by a similar belief: media output is influenced by its practitioners. It also raises a further set of questions. In the case of Muslims, what has been the effect of negative stereotyping? On them, and on others? As for the white working class, what has been the impact of the middle-class nature of the media? In both instances, does it help to explain why mainstream media is, at one extreme, distrusted and therefore abused or, at the other, regarded as irrelevant and therefore ignored?",

The \u201cBasic Law\u201d constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2003:&nbsp;</b>Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2007:&nbsp;</b>The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive\u2019s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong&nbsp;Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2014:&nbsp;</b>The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of \u201cfake universal suffrage\u201d and \u201cfake democracy\u201d. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015,&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party\u2019s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2019:&nbsp;</b>Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/hong-kong-lam-to-withdraw-extradition-bill-say-reports\">Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The weeks of protests in Hong Kong have led to the territory\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/15/hong-kong-leader-carrie-lam-extradition-bill-delay-protests-china\">suspending the extradition bill</a> and apologising for the way it was handled.

The weeks of protests in Hong Kong have led to the territory\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, suspending the extradition bill and apologising for the way it was handled. Activists want it to be formally withdrawn and for her to quit. On Sunday protesters targeted transport links to the mainland. Liu was summoned to the Foreign Office for a dressing down on 3 July, the same day he used a press conference to lambast the UK government for its comments on the Hong Kong protests. Relations between London and Beijing have also been strained by the ongoing uncertainty over whether Huawei will be allowed to play a role in the UK\u2019s 5G mobile infrastructure. The US has been pushing for allies to block Huawei, claiming it could pose a security risk \u2013 allegations strenuously denied by Huawei. Huawei is involved in building 5G networks in six of the seven cities in the UK where Vodafone\u2019s service has gone live, even though the government has yet to confirm whether the company will be permitted to build the next generation of wireless infrastructure, the Observer reported on Saturday. It is also helping build hundreds of 5G sites for EE and has won 5G contracts to build networks for Three and O2 when they go live. Liu said he could give a guarantee that the firm would not pass secrets gleaned from the 5G network to Beijing. \u201cI can promise that, 100%,\u201d he said. \u201cI think Huawei is a good company, it is a leader on 5G.

      "body": "<p>Lads, lads, lads, hate to interrupt, but how\u2019s your ejaculate? Would you struggle to fill half a teaspoon? And your concentration, please: are we talking 20m-plus little swimmers a millilitre? And how\u2019s that motility? Are your spermatozoa wagging their flagella as if they can\u2019t wait to get to that ovum \u2013 or listlessly floating around like dead tadpoles in a poorly executed classroom experiment? It\u2019s not that embarrassing, surely?</p> <p>If you are hoping to fertilise a human egg someday and haven\u2019t given much thought to these matters \u2026 well, Big Sperm reckons it is time you did. A wave of tech startups, such as <a href=\"https://www.exseedhealth.com/\" title=\"\">ExSeed</a>, <a href=\"https://www.yospermtest.com/\" title=\"\">Yo</a>, <a href=\"https://trakfertility.com/\" title=\"\">Trak</a> and <a href=\"https://www.givelegacy.com/\" title=\"\">Legacy</a>, are offering next-generation home sperm-testing technology and \u2013 in some cases \u2013 sperm-freezing services. And even if British men aren\u2019t quite ready to start comparing their fertility concerns yet, these are clearly lurking at the back of many minds.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we realised how many men are \u2018just curious\u2019 about their reproductive health,\u201d says Greg Sommer, the chief science officer of Trak, which offers home testing kits, sperm-freezing and even sperm-training regimes. \u201cThe product is primarily targeted at couples trying to get pregnant, but about a third of our customers are using Trak while not actively trying to conceive.\u201d In some cases, those men will have a specific concern: a past injury, say, or a history of steroid use. But others are just driven by curiosity. Sommer finds it encouraging. \u201cIn the past, men have mostly shrugged off fertility as a women\u2019s issue. Today, men <em>and</em> women recognise the role that men play.\u201d</p> <p>Morten Ulsted, the CEO of the Danish company ExSeed, which launched in the UK in January, says the whole men\u2019s health sector is \u201cbooming\u201d. He cites the emergence of female-focused tech, such as the period-tracking app <a href=\"https://helloclue.com/\" title=\"\">Clue</a> or the intelligent breast pump <a href=\"https://www.elvie.com/\" title=\"\">Elvie</a> as inspiration. \u201cWe have all seen what\u2019s happened to \u2018femtech\u2019 in the past few years. It is predicted to be a $40bn industry by 2020, and it was nonexistent five years ago. Now the same thing is happening with male-specific issues \u2013 we just need a catchy name.\u201d</p> <p>Around one in seven British couples have difficulty conceiving, according to the NHS, and, in about 40% of cases, the problem lies with the man. But, in general, fertility tends to be framed as a women\u2019s issue. Ulsted cites one survey that found 42% of British men had concerns about their fertility, but only 18% of men had considered a test. \u201cOf those, 33% said they wanted the woman to test first,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if it\u2019s something that you\u2019re worried about, why not just do it? And where there is stigma, tech can really help. It\u2019s so much more comfortable to do a sperm test in the privacy of your home than it is to visit a fertility clinic.\u201d</p> <p>While a woman is born with all the eggs she will ever have, a man produces fresh sperm every 72 days or so. ExSeed works with a mail-order test you <a href=\"https://www.exseedhealth.com/welcome-to-exseed-health/\" title=\"\">can operate via your phone</a>; it compares results with a vast database of sperm samples to give you an analysis of volume, motility and concentration \u2013 and can then offer a personalised training programme for improving them. \u201cPeople are often just told their sperm is suboptimal and they should be more healthy,\u201d Ulsted says. \u201cWell, great, but that\u2019s hard to do. What we say is, here are the top two or three pieces of advice that are likely to have an impact on you. Mostly, it\u2019s low-hanging fruit, such as drinking less and exercising a little more, plus a few supplements.\u201d</p> <p>It is possible to improve sperm count in the short term. Ulsted points to evidence that some men under professional guidance managed to improve sperm concentration by 25% and motility by 40% over a 25-week period.</p> <p>One factor driving investment in this sector is the long-term decline in fertility rates among western men. <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/23/6/646/4035689\" title=\"\">A study in the journal Human Reproduction Update in 2017</a> found that sperm count in men from North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand had dropped by 59.3% since 1973. If it continues to decline at this rate, soon humans will no longer be able to reproduce naturally. And, as the authors say, nobody really knows what is causing it.</p> <p>Is it exposure to <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1280383/\" title=\"\">phthalates in plastics</a>? There is a link between mothers being exposed to these common chemicals and decreased genital size in boys. Is it <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5744631/\" title=\"\">hormone-altering chemicals in sunscreen</a>? <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11800170\" title=\"\">Oestrogen in the water supply?</a> Industrial pesticides? (Environmentalists have voiced grave concerns about sperm decline in birds and bees.) \u201cIt\u2019s within a generation, so it\u2019s not genetic \u2013 which means it has to be lifestyle: diet, lifestyle, stress factors,\u201d says Ulsted, whose interest in sperm began when he read the study.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a5ca31329cc2fba364e85d3fa4d7836a83e9f94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a5ca31329cc2fba364e85d3fa4d7836a83e9f94/493_18_6300_3780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ryan Gillett\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The good news is that individual men can do something about their lifestyle fairly easily and expect to see improvement within a few months. But you can\u2019t easily remove people from western society to isolate the reasons for the long-term decline. This has become a source of great anguish on men\u2019s rights forums, where it is sometimes seen as evidence of a feminist plot to emasculate and ultimately eliminate the western male.</p> <p>Much better understood are the risk factors for fathers hoping to conceive later in life. \u201cWe talk about women\u2019s age and fertility all the time, as if they\u2019re the only thing that matter,\u201d says Geeta Nargund, the medical director of Create fertility clinics. \u201cThe main difference is that women\u2019s fertility stops, but men\u2019s declines over time. And the risk factors increase. Not only can it take five times as long to conceive when the male partner is over 45; the risk of miscarriage is twice as high, even when the partner is much younger. Then there is <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5412832/\" title=\"\">an increased risk</a> of children being born with neurological disorders, such as autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\u201d</p> <p>American entrepreneurs increasingly promote sperm-freezing as a solution to these problems. It is already fairly common among men who are about to undergo cancer treatment, have a vasectomy or go through gender reassignment surgery. But it is only recently that men have been encouraged to do so as an \u201cinsurance policy\u201d, as Sommer puts it.</p> <p>\u201cI think the idea of men freezing their sperm \u2018just because\u2019 is quite new, but we certainly welcome it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt speaks to the growing awareness and engagement men have with their health. It also shows that men are embracing and prioritising fatherhood as part of their life goals.\u201d He points out that it is easier for men to freeze their sperm than it is for women to freeze their eggs: \u201cSo why not?\u201d But it takes a little planning. \u201cJust as you should try to optimise your sperm count when trying to conceive, you should also optimise it before freezing it. That sample you collect for freezing is an important one \u2013 best to give it your best shot.\u201d (The temptation to pun in his industry must be overwhelming, I remark. \u201cIt gets hard,\u201d he agrees.)</p> <p>People who work in the fertility industry in the UK are more sceptical. Nargund sees egg- and sperm-freezing as \u201cdrastic solutions\u201d to problems that would better be solved by increased fertility awareness. In some high-risk cases, it may be worth considering. Certain forms of medication affect sperm count, notably SSRI-style antidepressants, some anti-epileptics and anti-diabetics. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17353961\" title=\"\">People who work with pesticides</a>, plastics and heavy metals, as well as taxi drivers and long-distance lorry drivers \u2013 because they sit for long periods in confined spaces \u2013 are at risk. And reproductive health is inextricably linked with general health: alcohol, recreational drugs, poor diet and sedentary lifestyles all pose potential problems. But, as new sperm is produced every three months or so, men who make the right sort of changes in their lifestyle often see significant improvements.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s not like heating up a frozen pie from Tesco. You can freeze good sperm, take it out and it can be depleted</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhat I wouldn\u2019t want is for men and women to freeze their sperm and then cease to worry about it,\u201d says Nargund. \u201cThe minute you freeze sperm, you are reliant on other forms of reproductive science, such as IVF. So you are outsourcing your reproduction to a clinic, and that will be expensive. It may not work the first time. And I\u2019m also opposed to women being exposed to unnecessary treatments.\u201d</p> <p>Moreover, the potential complications of later-life paternity don\u2019t end with conception. \u201cLet\u2019s say you freeze your sperm at 30 to have a child at 50. We have to think of the welfare of the child, too. A man of 50 will be 65 by the time the child is 15. It might be younger sperm, but still there are other issues to consider. We should encourage men and women to start families when they are younger when it is possible.\u201d She concedes that this isn\u2019t what men will want to hear, even if it\u2019s the sort of message women have been getting for years.</p> <p>Allan Pacey, a professor of andrology at the University of Sheffield who has advised Legacy on its sperm-testing technology, wonders why we are so reluctant to heed these dangers. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of evidence about the male-age impact on children. The data has been around for 20 or 30 years. But we tend to ignore it, as it bucks what society wants. Nature tells us to have children in our late teens and early 20s \u2013 it doesn\u2019t really want us to have children in our mid-to-late 30s.\u201d He, too, doesn\u2019t see sperm-freezing as much of a solution, particularly in the UK. \u201cIt\u2019s not like heating up a frozen pie from Tesco. You can freeze perfectly good sperm and take it out and it can be depleted.\u201d While some couples may find success using their defrosted sperm \u201cin a turkey-baster kind of way\u201d, most won\u2019t, and will end up reliant on IVF.</p> <p>He is sceptical about claims of a western sperm crisis. \u201cYes, the graphs show a striking decline, but looking at measures of sperm quality over time is fraught with potential for bias.

      "bodyText": "Lads, lads, lads, hate to interrupt, but how\u2019s your ejaculate? Would you struggle to fill half a teaspoon? And your concentration, please: are we talking 20m-plus little swimmers a millilitre? And how\u2019s that motility? Are your spermatozoa wagging their flagella as if they can\u2019t wait to get to that ovum \u2013 or listlessly floating around like dead tadpoles in a poorly executed classroom experiment? It\u2019s not that embarrassing, surely? If you are hoping to fertilise a human egg someday and haven\u2019t given much thought to these matters \u2026 well, Big Sperm reckons it is time you did. A wave of tech startups, such as ExSeed, Yo, Trak and Legacy, are offering next-generation home sperm-testing technology and \u2013 in some cases \u2013 sperm-freezing services. And even if British men aren\u2019t quite ready to start comparing their fertility concerns yet, these are clearly lurking at the back of many minds. \u201cI don\u2019t think we realised how many men are \u2018just curious\u2019 about their reproductive health,\u201d says Greg Sommer, the chief science officer of Trak, which offers home testing kits, sperm-freezing and even sperm-training regimes. \u201cThe product is primarily targeted at couples trying to get pregnant, but about a third of our customers are using Trak while not actively trying to conceive.\u201d In some cases, those men will have a specific concern: a past injury, say, or a history of steroid use. But others are just driven by curiosity. Sommer finds it encouraging. \u201cIn the past, men have mostly shrugged off fertility as a women\u2019s issue. Today, men and women recognise the role that men play.\u201d Morten Ulsted, the CEO of the Danish company ExSeed, which launched in the UK in January, says the whole men\u2019s health sector is \u201cbooming\u201d. He cites the emergence of female-focused tech, such as the period-tracking app Clue or the intelligent breast pump Elvie as inspiration. \u201cWe have all seen what\u2019s happened to \u2018femtech\u2019 in the past few years. It is predicted to be a $40bn industry by 2020, and it was nonexistent five years ago. Now the same thing is happening with male-specific issues \u2013 we just need a catchy name.\u201d Around one in seven British couples have difficulty conceiving, according to the NHS, and, in about 40% of cases, the problem lies with the man. But, in general, fertility tends to be framed as a women\u2019s issue. Ulsted cites one survey that found 42% of British men had concerns about their fertility, but only 18% of men had considered a test. \u201cOf those, 33% said they wanted the woman to test first,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if it\u2019s something that you\u2019re worried about, why not just do it? And where there is stigma, tech can really help. It\u2019s so much more comfortable to do a sperm test in the privacy of your home than it is to visit a fertility clinic.\u201d While a woman is born with all the eggs she will ever have, a man produces fresh sperm every 72 days or so. ExSeed works with a mail-order test you can operate via your phone; it compares results with a vast database of sperm samples to give you an analysis of volume, motility and concentration \u2013 and can then offer a personalised training programme for improving them. \u201cPeople are often just told their sperm is suboptimal and they should be more healthy,\u201d Ulsted says. \u201cWell, great, but that\u2019s hard to do. What we say is, here are the top two or three pieces of advice that are likely to have an impact on you. Mostly, it\u2019s low-hanging fruit, such as drinking less and exercising a little more, plus a few supplements.\u201d It is possible to improve sperm count in the short term. Ulsted points to evidence that some men under professional guidance managed to improve sperm concentration by 25% and motility by 40% over a 25-week period. One factor driving investment in this sector is the long-term decline in fertility rates among western men. A study in the journal Human Reproduction Update in 2017 found that sperm count in men from North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand had dropped by 59.3% since 1973. If it continues to decline at this rate, soon humans will no longer be able to reproduce naturally. And, as the authors say, nobody really knows what is causing it. Is it exposure to phthalates in plastics? There is a link between mothers being exposed to these common chemicals and decreased genital size in boys. Is it hormone-altering chemicals in sunscreen? Oestrogen in the water supply? Industrial pesticides? (Environmentalists have voiced grave concerns about sperm decline in birds and bees.) \u201cIt\u2019s within a generation, so it\u2019s not genetic \u2013 which means it has to be lifestyle: diet, lifestyle, stress factors,\u201d says Ulsted, whose interest in sperm began when he read the study. The good news is that individual men can do something about their lifestyle fairly easily and expect to see improvement within a few months. But you can\u2019t easily remove people from western society to isolate the reasons for the long-term decline. This has become a source of great anguish on men\u2019s rights forums, where it is sometimes seen as evidence of a feminist plot to emasculate and ultimately eliminate the western male. Much better understood are the risk factors for fathers hoping to conceive later in life. \u201cWe talk about women\u2019s age and fertility all the time, as if they\u2019re the only thing that matter,\u201d says Geeta Nargund, the medical director of Create fertility clinics. \u201cThe main difference is that women\u2019s fertility stops, but men\u2019s declines over time. And the risk factors increase. Not only can it take five times as long to conceive when the male partner is over 45; the risk of miscarriage is twice as high, even when the partner is much younger. Then there is an increased risk of children being born with neurological disorders, such as autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\u201d American entrepreneurs increasingly promote sperm-freezing as a solution to these problems. It is already fairly common among men who are about to undergo cancer treatment, have a vasectomy or go through gender reassignment surgery. But it is only recently that men have been encouraged to do so as an \u201cinsurance policy\u201d, as Sommer puts it. \u201cI think the idea of men freezing their sperm \u2018just because\u2019 is quite new, but we certainly welcome it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt speaks to the growing awareness and engagement men have with their health. It also shows that men are embracing and prioritising fatherhood as part of their life goals.\u201d He points out that it is easier for men to freeze their sperm than it is for women to freeze their eggs: \u201cSo why not?\u201d But it takes a little planning. \u201cJust as you should try to optimise your sperm count when trying to conceive, you should also optimise it before freezing it. That sample you collect for freezing is an important one \u2013 best to give it your best shot.\u201d (The temptation to pun in his industry must be overwhelming, I remark. \u201cIt gets hard,\u201d he agrees.) People who work in the fertility industry in the UK are more sceptical. Nargund sees egg- and sperm-freezing as \u201cdrastic solutions\u201d to problems that would better be solved by increased fertility awareness. In some high-risk cases, it may be worth considering. Certain forms of medication affect sperm count, notably SSRI-style antidepressants, some anti-epileptics and anti-diabetics. People who work with pesticides, plastics and heavy metals, as well as taxi drivers and long-distance lorry drivers \u2013 because they sit for long periods in confined spaces \u2013 are at risk. And reproductive health is inextricably linked with general health: alcohol, recreational drugs, poor diet and sedentary lifestyles all pose potential problems. But, as new sperm is produced every three months or so, men who make the right sort of changes in their lifestyle often see significant improvements. \u201cWhat I wouldn\u2019t want is for men and women to freeze their sperm and then cease to worry about it,\u201d says Nargund. \u201cThe minute you freeze sperm, you are reliant on other forms of reproductive science, such as IVF. So you are outsourcing your reproduction to a clinic, and that will be expensive. It may not work the first time. And I\u2019m also opposed to women being exposed to unnecessary treatments.\u201d Moreover, the potential complications of later-life paternity don\u2019t end with conception. \u201cLet\u2019s say you freeze your sperm at 30 to have a child at 50. We have to think of the welfare of the child, too. A man of 50 will be 65 by the time the child is 15. It might be younger sperm, but still there are other issues to consider. We should encourage men and women to start families when they are younger when it is possible.\u201d She concedes that this isn\u2019t what men will want to hear, even if it\u2019s the sort of message women have been getting for years. Allan Pacey, a professor of andrology at the University of Sheffield who has advised Legacy on its sperm-testing technology, wonders why we are so reluctant to heed these dangers. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of evidence about the male-age impact on children. The data has been around for 20 or 30 years. But we tend to ignore it, as it bucks what society wants. Nature tells us to have children in our late teens and early 20s \u2013 it doesn\u2019t really want us to have children in our mid-to-late 30s.\u201d He, too, doesn\u2019t see sperm-freezing as much of a solution, particularly in the UK. \u201cIt\u2019s not like heating up a frozen pie from Tesco. You can freeze perfectly good sperm and take it out and it can be depleted.\u201d While some couples may find success using their defrosted sperm \u201cin a turkey-baster kind of way\u201d, most won\u2019t, and will end up reliant on IVF. He is sceptical about claims of a western sperm crisis. \u201cYes, the graphs show a striking decline, but looking at measures of sperm quality over time is fraught with potential for bias. Techniques have changed and our understanding of the margins of error have changed. I tend to go with the Carl Sagan view that if you\u2019re going to make an extraordinary claim, you need extraordinary evidence.\u201d The decline is, as he points out, from \u201cnormal to normal\u201d: concentration levels have gone from 99m sperm a millilitre to 47m, and anything above 20m is fine. It is true we\u2019re having fewer children in Europe, and that\u2019s not the case in Africa, say. But it\u2019s hard to disentangle this from socioeconomic factors. \u201cWealth tends to be a good contraceptive,\u201d Pacey says \u2013 as GDP rises, people tend to have fewer children. \u201cAll the same, I do wonder why male fertility is not higher up the political and healthcare agenda,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy do we still see this through a female prism?

Despite deriving most of its wealth from fossil fuels, Norway has used spending and tax cuts to drive up the sale of electric vehicles to count for half of all cars sold. And it targets the end of petrol and diesel car sales by 2025. Britain has had some success. The carbon intensity of Britain\u2019s energy production has improved markedly with the rapid increase in wind energy. As coal-burning power stations are phased out, about half of energy production is now from renewables and nuclear. Some Tories are moving in the right direction. Last week, the Conservative Environment Network set out a manifesto that included banning fracking, a sevenfold increase in offshore wind by 2050, an earlier ban on new petrol and diesel cars and vans, as well as fertiliser and pesticide taxes. They should be encouraged to go further still. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt broadly welcome the thrust of the debate, but neither leadership contender has endorsed the recommendations. Both have made profligate tax and spending commitments in their campaign, with little reference to the emergency facing the climate. Rather than entering into a bidding war on tax breaks for the rich, the next prime minister should commit more money instead to a real response to the climate crisis. The scale of the emergency requires it.",

That is an historic occasion but England are also planning to use it as vital preparation for the Ashes series. Now there is no guarantee Anderson will be fit for either game.</p> <p>Anderson left the field during Lancashire\u2019s County Championship match against Durham at Sedbergh school on 2 July because of tightness to his right calf; he underwent an MRI scan on Friday and now begins a rehabilitation programme with the England and Lancashire medical teams.

It would be a severe blow to England\u2019s chances of regaining the Ashes if he was absent at the start. They would miss not only his bowling but also his on-field guidance.</p> <p>At least England, who are assembling at Edgbaston to prepare for their World Cup semi-final against Australia, have some credible alternatives. Throughout the World Cup Jofra Archer, who had never bowled a ball for England until May, has been impressive, bowling fast and demonstrating an appetite for the big occasion.

      "bodyText": "Jimmy Anderson, England\u2019s record-breaking seam bowler and the spearhead of the bowling attack, is in serious danger of missing the first Test against Australia following the news that an MRI scan has shown he has suffered a \u201clow-grade calf muscle tear\u201d. The first Test in the most condensed Ashes series ever undertaken begins on 1 August at Edgbaston and is preceded by England\u2019s first Test match against Ireland at Lord\u2019s, which starts on 24 July. That is an historic occasion but England are also planning to use it as vital preparation for the Ashes series. Now there is no guarantee Anderson will be fit for either game. Anderson left the field during Lancashire\u2019s County Championship match against Durham at Sedbergh school on 2 July because of tightness to his right calf; he underwent an MRI scan on Friday and now begins a rehabilitation programme with the England and Lancashire medical teams. He will miss Lancashire\u2019s next two championship matches, against Northamptonshire and Sussex. The England and Wales Cricket Board confirmed the injury and said Anderson would be \u201creassessed on an ongoing basis regarding his availability\u201d for the match against Ireland and the first Ashes Test. Despite his age \u2013 36 \u2013 Anderson has an excellent fitness record in recent times and remains England\u2019s first-choice pace bowler in red-ball cricket; he was the outstanding bowler in England\u2019s last Ashes campaign in Australia, albeit in a side who were easily overwhelmed. It would be a severe blow to England\u2019s chances of regaining the Ashes if he was absent at the start. They would miss not only his bowling but also his on-field guidance. At least England, who are assembling at Edgbaston to prepare for their World Cup semi-final against Australia, have some credible alternatives. Throughout the World Cup Jofra Archer, who had never bowled a ball for England until May, has been impressive, bowling fast and demonstrating an appetite for the big occasion. Anderson\u2019s absence could well hasten the 24-year-old\u2019s Test debut. If England are fearful of missing Anderson\u2019s vast experience they know they can call on Stuart Broad, who, like Anderson, has been appearing in county cricket this summer in order to ensure he is ready for the challenge of another Ashes campaign. Within the World Cup squad there are also two bowlers whose chances of playing at Lord\u2019s and Edgbaston are enhanced if Anderson is not fit. Mark Wood played in England\u2019s last Test match in St Lucia in February, where he took six wickets against West Indies, sufficient to win the man of the match award. Chris Woakes, who has not played a Test since August 2018, partly because of nagging injury concerns, has been displaying increasingly good form in the World Cup. If Anderson is sidelined three of the four mentioned above are likely to join Ben Stokes in England\u2019s pace attack at the start of the Ashes. But none can be regarded as like-for-like replacements for England\u2019s most successful and durable pace bowler.",

      "bodyText": "From his 2002 debut novel, Waiting for an Angel, about a reporter jailed in the 90s under the regime of Nigerian dictator Sani Abacha, to 2010\u2019s Oil on Water, a hostage narrative set amid the petroleum industry\u2019s ruin of the Niger delta, Helon Habila has tackled weighty issues without solemnity. It\u2019s a virtue on show once again in Travellers, a nuanced, often surprising novel-in-stories about the experiences of six African refugees in Europe, and his first book set outside his native Nigeria. Its unnamed narrator (like Habila, a Nigerian based in the US) joins his American wife, Gina, in Berlin, where she has a year\u2019s fellowship to produce a series of portraits of \u201creal migrants\u201d. When he starts drinking with Mark, an anarchist squatter from Malawi who has been rejected by Gina as a prospective subject \u2013 not real enough \u2013 it\u2019s a sign of marital tension as well as the novel\u2019s suspicion of Gina\u2019s authenticity fetish. As the narrator learns why Mark \u2013 born Mary, it transpires \u2013 ran away from his pastor father, we infer that ideas of \u201crealness\u201d might boil down to prejudice by another name. Mark\u2019s is only the first story the narrator gets mixed up in; later, he meets a hunger-striking asylum seeker who flees Boko Haram only to fall foul of Theresa May\u2019s hostile environment, and a Libyan surgeon employed as a bouncer after losing his wife and son en route from Tripoli, stubbornly bringing his 11-year-old daughter to the family\u2019s prearranged rendezvous at Checkpoint Charlie every Sunday, in a heartbreaking denial of reality. Habila\u2019s acknowledgments thank \u201cthe voices whose stories animate this book... for trusting me\u201d, which adds to a sense that he\u2019s drawing on as-told-to testimony. In the standout chapter, a Zambian woman travels to Switzerland to meet her brother\u2019s wife, jailed for his manslaughter. She learns that in Europe, her brother, David, went by the name Moussa and claimed to be from Mali for reasons to do with his feelings about his father, a once-exiled poet who, drunk on fame, pandered to western liberals keen to view Africa as \u201cone huge Gulag archipelago\u201d.

      "body": "<p>The dance strand of the Manchester international festival kicked off with a blockbuster. Performed in a cavernous former railway depot, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/gallery/2019/jul/04/invisible-cities-manchester-international-festival\">Invisible Cities</a> (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606) features actors, dancers, digital animations and amazing stage designs. In adapting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2011/jun/02/venice-biennale-italo-calvino\">Italo Calvino\u2019s novel</a> of the same name, it aims for sweeping themes such as imagination, power, belonging, morality and mortality. \u201cThe question of whether this was one of my best ideas or an act of pure folly remains open,\u201d writes director Leo Warner in the programme. My answer is that it\u2019s both. Cued by the book, the piece is a hallucinatory string of scenes as Marco Polo (Matthew Leonhart) tells tales of fantastical cities to the emperor Kublai Khan (Danny Sapani). In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jun/14/derelict-manchester-train-station-59-productions-italo-calvino-invisible-cities-mayfield\">a </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jun/14/derelict-manchester-train-station-59-productions-italo-calvino-invisible-cities-mayfield\">feat of production design</a>, the stage \u2013 around which the audience, like compass points, is divided into four distinct phalanxes \u2013 morphs from throne room to temple, encampment to shopping mall, and even to a Venetian canal, complete with water, gondola and bridge. Choreographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/sidi-larbi-cherkaoui\">Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui</a> animates these sets with the superb <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/rambert\">Rambert dancers</a>. In one scene, handheld lights create galactic constellations; in another, the dancers clump together into chimerical demons with many heads and compound bodies. They use props ingeniously, arching laminated strips into vaulted domes, ambulating on stilts to suggest a caravan of camels, or stretching ribbons into a cat\u2019s cradle, part connective network, part abstract geometry.</p> <p>Add in panoramic digital animations of forests, seas, skies and skyscrapers, and there are marvels to behold. Yet as with many a blockbuster, the work often feels overwrought. One scene flies past another, the music by <a href=\"https://awvfts.com/about/\">Dustin O\u2019Halloran and Adam Bryanbaum Wiltzie</a> \u2013 all swoons, thumps and thundering \u2013 seems designed for manipulative effect, and the story strains for significance, with intertitles announcing grandiloquent themes: language, questions, desire, health, despair.

      "bodyText": "The dance strand of the Manchester international festival kicked off with a blockbuster. Performed in a cavernous former railway depot, Invisible Cities (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606) features actors, dancers, digital animations and amazing stage designs. In adapting Italo Calvino\u2019s novel of the same name, it aims for sweeping themes such as imagination, power, belonging, morality and mortality. \u201cThe question of whether this was one of my best ideas or an act of pure folly remains open,\u201d writes director Leo Warner in the programme. My answer is that it\u2019s both. Cued by the book, the piece is a hallucinatory string of scenes as Marco Polo (Matthew Leonhart) tells tales of fantastical cities to the emperor Kublai Khan (Danny Sapani). In a feat of production design, the stage \u2013 around which the audience, like compass points, is divided into four distinct phalanxes \u2013 morphs from throne room to temple, encampment to shopping mall, and even to a Venetian canal, complete with water, gondola and bridge. Choreographer Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui animates these sets with the superb Rambert dancers. In one scene, handheld lights create galactic constellations; in another, the dancers clump together into chimerical demons with many heads and compound bodies. They use props ingeniously, arching laminated strips into vaulted domes, ambulating on stilts to suggest a caravan of camels, or stretching ribbons into a cat\u2019s cradle, part connective network, part abstract geometry. Add in panoramic digital animations of forests, seas, skies and skyscrapers, and there are marvels to behold. Yet as with many a blockbuster, the work often feels overwrought. One scene flies past another, the music by Dustin O\u2019Halloran and Adam Bryanbaum Wiltzie \u2013 all swoons, thumps and thundering \u2013 seems designed for manipulative effect, and the story strains for significance, with intertitles announcing grandiloquent themes: language, questions, desire, health, despair. Ultimately, the piece founders on its central encounter between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan. Writer Lolita Chakrabarti doesn\u2019t synthesise Calvino\u2019s poetics with her own more character-driven drama, and the actors are left with loud, mystical declamations and mystifying motivations. Invisible Cities certainly has a wow factor, not to mention epic ambitions that, towards the end, it nearly achieves. but it is also profligate with its own resources. Less overproduction might produce less wastage. Over at the Great Northern Warehouse, the high-ambition but much lower-budget Alphabus (\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606) is similar on several counts. This collaboration between local spoken-word artists and dancers from Manchester and New York is set in a former industrial site, has its audience on all sides, aspires towards cosmic significance and uses dance more to illustrate than generate its story. Again, there is a central encounter that is hard to track \u2013 here, a struggle between father and son over a fabled book of forbidden words. Though its scenes are scattershot, many moments are effective on their own: a vocal face-off over arms that reach up as if from the underworld; a dancer keeling over from a precarious upside-down balance as the lights fade. Especially impressive are the flex dancers, arms twisting into pipe-cleaner positions, ankles angled to let them snake across the stage. Yet it\u2019s telling that the high point of the event is its encore. Liberated from the demands of acting and storytelling, the performers come to life through sound, rhythm and physicality. There\u2019s clearly a lot of talent here, but Alphabus is not the best vehicle for it. \u2022 Invisible Cities runs until 14 July at Mayfield, Manchester. Alphabus runs until 7 July at Great Northern Warehouse, Manchester. \u2022 The Guardian is a media partner of Manchester international festival.",

He said the correspondence came from former Labour officials who had asked Corbyn\u2019s office for help in how to deal with antisemitism cases. But the programme did not make that clear, he claimed, and he said it did not feature the incidents where Corbyn\u2019s aides proposed \u201ca stronger response\u201d. In private, Labour figures have been even more critical of the BBC over the programme. One party source told the Sunday Times: \u201cWith a possible general election around the corner, this smacks of bias and interference in the political process by the BBC and a clear breach of their own editorial guidelines.\u201d On Sunday the BBC said Labour was \u201ccriticising a programme they have not seen\u201d. A spokesman said the corporation was confident the film adhered to its guidelines, and that Labour had been given a chance to respond. A Labour spokesperson said: \u201cIt appears these disaffected former officials include those who have always opposed Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership, worked to actively undermine it, and have both personal and political axes to grind. This throws into doubt their credibility as sources. \u201cOur records show that after these officials left and after Jennie Formby became general secretary, the rate at which antisemitism cases have been dealt with, increased fourfold.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Forty-one refugees and migrants disembarked overnight at the port of Lampedusa after a charity vessel that rescued them off Libya defied an attempt by Italy\u2019s far-right interior minister, Matteo Salvini, to close ports to NGO boats. The Italian-flagged Alex, run by the NGO Mediterranea, was escorted by the Italian coastguard and on Saturday the ship was seized by police, the captain was put under investigation for allegedly aiding illegal immigration, and the rescuees eventually disembarked. Mediterranea was fined \u20ac16.000 (\u00a314,300). The arrival of the Alex, which docked in the Sicilian port after spending two days stranded at sea, follows the arrest of Carola Rackete, the German captain of the another NGO rescue boat, Sea-Watch 3. On 28 June she was temporarily placed under house arrest for violating an Italian naval blockade that was trying to stop her bringing to the Sicilian port a group of asylum seekers she had rescued in the central Mediterranean. Rackete told the Guardian in an interview on Saturday: \u201cIf I were to find myself in the same situation, I have no doubts I would do everything again, because people\u2019s lives matter more than any political game.\u201d Rackete was arrested on charges of resistance and violence against warships. As she had manoeuvred her vessel into the port, she had risked ramming into a military boat that was trying to prevent her from docking. On Tuesday a judge in Agrigento, Sicily, released her from the house arrest, ruling that Rackete had been carrying out her duty to protect life and had not committed any act of violence. The judge also ruled that neither Libya nor Tunisia were safe countries for migrants. Fot this reason, the Alex, which on 5 July rescued a group of people from an inflatable raft drifting off the coast of Libya, decided to head to Lampedusa, \u201cthe only possible safe port for landing\u201d, as Mediterranea said in a tweet. \u201cLaw enforcement forces are ready to intervene \u2026 in a normal country there would be immediate arrests and the boat would be impounded,\u201d Salvini replied in another tweet. Salvini, who is also deputy prime minister, has repeatedly declared Italian seaports closed to NGO rescue vessels, leaving several boats stranded at sea for weeks. On 14 June Italy\u2019s far-right-populist coalition government introduced a security decree that forbade NGO rescue boats from entering Italian territorial waters and allowed for fines of up to \u20ac50,000 (\u00a345,000) and the impounding of boats that brought migrants to Italy without permission. However, as has been happened with the Sea-Watch 3 last week, the Alex ignored Salvini\u2019s ban and forced its way to the port, angering the interior minister. \u201cJackals!\u201d tweeted Salvini. \u201cThey should go to prison!\u201d The German and French governments have stepped up their criticism of Italy over its handling of the recent cases of refugee landings. France accused Italy on Tuesday of acting hysterically over immigration and failing to live up to its duties. The German interior minister, Horst Seehofer, wrote to Salvini asking him to rethink his policy, sources close to the German government said. \u201cWe cannot be responsible for boats with people rescued from shipwrecks on board spending weeks on the Mediterranean because they can\u2019t find a port,\u201d Seehofer wrote.",

Homeowners with balconies along the route rent them out for \u20ac50-\u20ac200 to visitors to enjoy the approximately 15 seconds it takes for the bulls to pass. In recent years, however, the event\u2019s reputation has been marred by a steady increase in complaints from women that they have suffered sexual harassment and abuse. This culminated in the case of five men styling themselves La Manada, \u201cthe wolf pack\u201d, who raped an 18-year-old woman during the festival in 2016. The five were jailed for 15 years last month after a protracted legal process often criticised for its perceived leniency towards the rapists. Last year 25 incidents were reported, down from 40 in 2017 and 43 in 2016. That year, in addition to the victim of the wolf-pack case, 18 other women reported sexually motivated attacks involving violence during the festival. Up until 2016, only a third of cases were resolved as it was difficult to identify the perpetrators in such a large crowd. Since then the centre of Pamplona has been covered by 21 security cameras. This year the organisers say that, in addition to the thousands of police on duty, agents from the family and women unit will be on duty to deal with, and hopefully prevent, abuses. There is also a San Ferm\u00edn app that, as well as offering information about events around the city, gives advice on how to deal with and report sexual offences. An information point was set up on Friday specifically to inform people about the issue and also to deal with complaints from women. It has a staff of six trained in dealing with sexual offences who between them speak Spanish, English, French and Basque. The local and national police, some on horseback, have been joined by uniformed officers from France and Italy, agents from the US embassy and riot police from Bilbao. The city council reaffirmed its \u201ccommitment to continue working for a festival in which men and women can freely and safely enjoy themselves\u201d. It said reports of sexual aggression would be dealt with in a \u201ccoordinated and consistent manner\u201d and thanked feminist groups for their active involvement in helping to eradicate sexual attacks. Before Sunday\u2019s opening encierro, as the bull runs are known, the streets along the route were treated with 1,500 litres of anti-slip liquid which helps to prevent the animals from losing their footing and also allows them run faster. The event is a target for animal rights activists and on Friday members of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) staged a protest in which they lay semi-naked on cut-out bull shapes resembling the chalk outline of bodies found at crime scenes. Jordi Casamitjana, Peta\u2019s campaigns manager, said most people did not realise the bulls were killed in the ring after the run, adding that the bull run itself was barbaric and that the animals were terrified. Peta claims that 125 Spanish cities have banned bullfighting. \u201cMost of the protesters are Spanish,\u201d Casamitjana said. \u201cThe reality is that the majority of Spaniards are against bullfighting.

      "body": "<p>If you\u2019re a regular reader, it will probably come as little surprise that I am a passionate believer in the therapeutic power of horticulture. I love witnessing the miracle of life unfold by sowing seeds, the satisfaction when a tree first bears fruit, the fresh scent of a mown lawn. However, there is one job I really can\u2019t hack, especially at this time of year of peak plant growth, and that\u2019s weeding. The hours of back-breaking work rooting out weeds between cracks in paving and in gravel drives, only to have to repeat the whole process a week later is (even to me) just too much like outdoor tidying up.</p> <p>Fortunately, there is a simple trick you can deploy to beat nature at its own game. You can harness the power of tough, low-growing ornamentals to out-compete weeds for space, water and nutrients in these nooks and crannies. Not only will this dramatically reduce the amount of time you\u2019ll need to spend weeding, but it will also turn a desert of paving and gravel into a colourful, living surface that will withstand any amount of trampling. Here are some of my favourite, hard-working candidates to fill cracks and crevices and get down to the business of fighting weeds.</p> <p>If you have a sunny patio, creeping thymes will spread a dense, evergreen carpet less than an inch high. Aside from emitting a wonderful herbal fragrance when stepped on, they will blush into flower in pastel shades though the summer months. There are plenty to choose from: <em>Thymus praecox</em> \u2018Pink Chintz\u2019 is, as its name suggests, a real showstopper with candy pink blossom, while \u2018Albiflorus\u2019 has pure white flowers.</p> <p>For lovers of the verdant mossy look who garden on dry, sunny spots, <em>Silene acaulis </em>is hard to beat.

      "bodyText": "If you\u2019re a regular reader, it will probably come as little surprise that I am a passionate believer in the therapeutic power of horticulture. I love witnessing the miracle of life unfold by sowing seeds, the satisfaction when a tree first bears fruit, the fresh scent of a mown lawn. However, there is one job I really can\u2019t hack, especially at this time of year of peak plant growth, and that\u2019s weeding. The hours of back-breaking work rooting out weeds between cracks in paving and in gravel drives, only to have to repeat the whole process a week later is (even to me) just too much like outdoor tidying up. Fortunately, there is a simple trick you can deploy to beat nature at its own game. You can harness the power of tough, low-growing ornamentals to out-compete weeds for space, water and nutrients in these nooks and crannies. Not only will this dramatically reduce the amount of time you\u2019ll need to spend weeding, but it will also turn a desert of paving and gravel into a colourful, living surface that will withstand any amount of trampling. Here are some of my favourite, hard-working candidates to fill cracks and crevices and get down to the business of fighting weeds. If you have a sunny patio, creeping thymes will spread a dense, evergreen carpet less than an inch high. Aside from emitting a wonderful herbal fragrance when stepped on, they will blush into flower in pastel shades though the summer months. There are plenty to choose from: Thymus praecox \u2018Pink Chintz\u2019 is, as its name suggests, a real showstopper with candy pink blossom, while \u2018Albiflorus\u2019 has pure white flowers. For lovers of the verdant mossy look who garden on dry, sunny spots, Silene acaulis is hard to beat. Its fluffy emerald foliage, with tiny pink summer flowers, makes it a thing of wonder. If a jaw-dropping blaze is more up your street, it is well worth hunting down the rare Turkish speedwell, Veronica liwanensis, which dazzles with ground-hugging clouds of cobalt-blue flowers appearing as if by magic between cracks in paving.

      "body": "<p>Cuyahoga Falls is a middle-class suburb of industrial Akron, Ohio, a grid of leafy streets and comfortable homes bordered by the river. When Jim Jarmusch was a boy, he knew to steer clear of the water because, while the town might be placid, the Cuyahoga river was toxic. Pickling acids had stained it bright orange. Factory detergents had put a white froth on its surface. In June 1969, a spark from a train set the Cuyahoga alight and the flames jumped as high as a five\u2011storey building.</p> <p>Fifty years on, Jarmusch remembers it well. \u201cIt was not a pleasant thing to happen,\u201d he says with the droll understatement that has become his signature style. \u201cIn fact, if you\u2019re looking for a metaphor of modern American life, it doesn\u2019t get more blatant than having your local river catch fire.\u201d</p> <p>As a film-maker, Jarmusch likes to make movies about the world\u2019s little details; about drifters and seekers and the rambling detours that add up to a life. It\u2019s an area of interest that has served him well, from 1984\u2019s meandering, monochrome <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088184/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\" title=\"\"><em>Stranger Than Paradise</em></a> through to 2016\u2019s soulful, meditative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/nov/24/paterson-review-adam-driver-jim-jarmusch\" title=\"\"><em>Paterson</em></a>. But it\u2019s hard to focus on the small pictures when the big one is so scary: when a river is burning or the whole planet\u2019s aflame. He says: \u201cIt\u2019s clear we\u2019re living in an ecological crisis and the situation is getting worse and worse. We\u2019re threatened by the denial of science and by corporate greed. If this is the path that we keep going down, then it is only going to lead to the end of the world.\u201d</p> <p>I first run into Jarmusch on the backstreets of Cannes in May this year, where his latest work, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/14/the-dead-dont-die-review-stumbling-zombie-comedy-kicks-off-cannes\" title=\"\"><em>The Dead Don\u2019t Die</em></a>, opens the film festival as climate crisis protesters gather beside the Palais. A few weeks later I speak to him again on the phone at his house in upstate New York. He explains that while he maintains a bolt-hole in his adopted Manhattan, these days he prefers living out in the Catskills. He shares the house with his partner of four decades, the actor and film-maker <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0238138/\" title=\"\">Sara Driver</a>. \u201cThis is family time,\u201d the 66-year-old says. \u201cI guess you could say I\u2019m up here to recover.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf7yaOmQo6Q\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Pf7yaOmQo6Q?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pf7yaOmQo6Q\">Watch a trailer for The Dead Don\u2019t Die.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The alternative view is that he\u2019s hiding out in the woods; the silver fox of independent cinema lying low, gone to ground. If the apocalypse is pending, <em>The Dead Don\u2019t Die</em> shows the way it might go, with polar fracking warping the planet\u2019s axis, Trump-supporting racists spinning on their bar-stools, and an army of zombies shuffling up main street. Jarmusch keeps referring to the film as a comedy \u2013 pretty funny, plenty of jokes \u2013 but his sales patter carries a plaintive note. He knows the film is not as frothy as he meant it to be.</p> <p>He sighs. \u201cThe tone is different from what I anticipated. It\u2019s a whole lot darker than I imagined, especially the ending. I try not to analyse these things too much, but that\u2019s reflective of the world we\u2019re in; the looming environmental crisis just became more and more of a cloud. I was working on this film for two years, and during that time it was as if the planet was changing on an almost daily basis.\u201d</p> <p>Small wonder that the finished movie pulls in different directions and seems almost at war with itself. The tale sets forth as a jaunty, knowing deconstruction of the zombie genre, only to be caught in the crossfire of fatalism and despair. \u201cThis whole thing\u2019s going to end badly,\u201d warns <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/09/adam-driver-acting-military-star-wars-the-last-jedi\" title=\"\">Adam Driver</a>\u2019s small-town cop as the walking dead descend on Centerville, calling out for coffee and wifi, chardonnay and Xanax. The cast\u2019s an amiable ragbag of Jarmusch\u2019s buddies and collaborators. There\u2019s Bill Murray, Tilda Swinton, an undead Iggy Pop. Tom Waits co-stars as Hermit Bob, a rackety old recluse who lives in the forest and survives on squirrels and bugs. He knows what\u2019s coming and accepts it with a shrug. \u201cThe world is fucked-up,\u201d he informs us at the end.</p> <p>The film was shot near Jarmusch\u2019s home, around the neighbouring towns of Kingston and Fleischmanns. This ought to have made the production simple, but somehow did not. The schedule was a nightmare; they only had Driver for three weeks. On top of that, it rained constantly. The director came down with the flu and broke a toe on the set. \u201cAnd then we had to rush to get the thing finished so that we could give it to Cannes.\u201d I have the sense that he\u2019s still trying to figure out what he\u2019s made. \u201cI mean, I wouldn\u2019t have changed the film at all. But I would probably have had more time to think about just what I was doing. It slipped out of my hands like a little child on the riverbank.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b569a21ce33a030f912996fffd6c970b9f777e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b569a21ce33a030f912996fffd6c970b9f777e7/0_202_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jarmusch at Cannes promoting The Dead Don\u2019t Die with stars Selena Gomez and Tilda Swinton in May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jarmusch at Cannes promoting The Dead Don\u2019t Die with stars Selena Gomez and Tilda Swinton in May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean-Paul P\u00e9lissier/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a kid back in Akron, Jarmusch dreamed of slipping away, too. The place was too small, too conservative. Everyone worked for the rubber companies: his dad for BF Goodrich, his uncle for Goodyear, his neighbour for Firestone. His mum, Betty French, had been an arts reporter for the <a href=\"https://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/2017/12/betty_french_jarmusch_pioneeri.html\" title=\"\"><em>Akron Beacon Journal</em></a>. She reviewed the young Marlon Brando in the Broadway production of <em>A Streetcar Named Desire</em> and covered the Hollywood wedding of Bogart and Bacall. But when she got married, she jacked in the day job and tucked herself away in a small upstairs office at home. Jarmusch remembers the sound of her picking away on an old Royal typewriter, turning out freelance articles for a local antiques magazine.</p> <p>He credits his mother for sparking an early interest in art, music and film. But he also drew inspiration from a more lurid source. The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7TcPI-vCDI\" title=\"\">\u201cghost-host\u201d Ghoulardi</a> was a costumed presenter who introduced B-movies on Cleveland\u2019s JWJ-TV station. <em>The Dead Don\u2019t Die</em> contains a Ghoulardi poster in homage.</p> <p>\u201cWell, he was a really important cultural figure,\u201d Jarmusch explains, deadpan. \u201cHe had a TV show on Friday nights at 11.30 where he would show sci-fi, horror or monster films \u2013 mainly monster films. And he did all kinds of crazy stuff in between. He was this beatnik kind of guy with a goatee, dressed in a white lab coat with a fright wig, dark glasses with one lens missing. He used a lot of hipster catchphrases that were all made up. He\u2019d explode model cars with cherry bombs and he had this early kinescopic effect where he would briefly place himself inside the film he was showing. So yeah, if you ask anyone who grew up in north-eastern Ohio in the 60s, we\u2019re all familiar with Ghoulardi and his influence on us. I think Chrissie Hynde still has her original Ghoulardi T-shirt.\u201d</p> <p>He pauses. \u201cYou know who Ghoulardi\u2019s son is, right?\u201d As it happens, I do. Ghoulardi was played by a TV announcer called Ernie Anderson who would later father Paul Thomas Anderson, the director of <em>Magnolia</em>, <em>Boogie Nights</em> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/04/phantom-thread-review-paul-thomas-anderson-daniel-day-lewis\" title=\"\"><em>Phantom Thread</em></a>. \u201cI\u2019ve only met Paul once, and the first thing I said to him was: \u2018Your dad was Ghoulardi!\u2019 He kind of rolled his eyes about it, but I mean, come on, that was my young bohemian dream \u2013 a weird dad like Ghoulardi.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"818690e10eea1845e091fecf54cd5b5aca199176\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/818690e10eea1845e091fecf54cd5b5aca199176/0_0_3846_2309/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scene from The Dead Don\u2019t Die.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scene from The Dead Don\u2019t Die.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Landmark Media/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Except why stop with Ghoulardi? Jarmusch is a pop-culture sponge. He soaks up pretty much everything and likes to quote Joe Strummer\u2019s old motto: \u201cNo input, no output.\u201d His films are made up of secondhand odds and sods, twisted to fit his own sensibility, possibly his own image. I tell him that they\u2019re distinctive and stylish, sometimes to a fault.</p> <p>\u201cWell, style is very important,\u201d he says, unperturbed. \u201cIt\u2019s what Martin Scorsese says differentiates all film-makers. Style is the important identifier of someone\u2019s personal expression.\u201d</p> <p>Hitchcock once said that drama is life with the dull bits cut out. But Jarmusch\u2019s films seem expressly designed to test that maxim, turn it upside down. They glide over scenes that might form the centrepiece of a more conventional picture and salvage incidentals from the cutting-room floor. On his 1986 breakthrough, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/11/down-by-law-review-jim-jarmusch-tom-waits\" title=\"\"><em>Down </em><em>By Law</em></a>, he rustled up a jailbreak drama that ignored the jailbreak. On the 1995 western <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112817/?ref_=nv_sr_2?ref_=nv_sr_2\" title=\"\"><em>Dead Man</em></a>, he took a perverse delight in finding the most humdrum locations in Oregon and Arizona. At their best, his pictures are ruminative and poetic all-American stories that move with the unhurried pace of Asian arthouse cinema, or postcards from obscure places, complete with doodled footnotes. Reviewing 1989\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-mystery-train-1989\" title=\"\"><em>Mystery Train,</em></a> Roger Ebert wrote: \u201cThe best thing about the film is that it takes you to an America you feel you ought to be able to find for yourself if you only knew where to look.\u201d</p> <p>Naturally, Jarmusch says, the films are a reflection of him. \u201cI know I have a laconic approach, time-wise. I know I talk kind of slowly. I probably think kind of slowly. I like slow music. I like slow films. That\u2019s just inherent. Godard said that every film-maker makes the same film over and over. That\u2019s probably true in my case.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b7150987ed127b78bf60df5e737ab703ff86ea8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b7150987ed127b78bf60df5e737ab703ff86ea8/0_0_1880_2016/933.jpg\" alt=\"Jim Jarmusch in 1984.\" width=\"933\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jim Jarmusch in 1984.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Let\u2019s talk about his personal style. That has remained a constant, too. Jarmusch\u2019s hair began to whiten when he was in his mid-teens, round about the time that the Cuyahoga caught fire, with the result that he barely seems to have changed over the ensuing half-century. Compare a picture from the 80s with the Jarmusch of today and it\u2019s hard to spot the difference. He has the same fine, handsome features, the same space-age quiff, the same dark charisma. In photographs, whether intentionally or not, he always appears to be striking a pose. It\u2019s as though he views himself as a frontman for the pictures that he makes.</p> <p>But the suggestion makes him snort. The surest way to prick his aura of pristine cool is to ask about his aura of pristine cool. \u201cI find that a ridiculous idea,\u201d he says. \u201cMy personal style, how I look and dress \u2013 I don\u2019t consider that to be a part of my art. It reminds me of when I was starting out and people would say: \u2018Oh my God, he wears black clothes and dyes his hair white and he makes black-and-white films. What a pretentious asshole.\u2019 Whereas none of these things was related to me. My hair was prematurely white. I started wearing black as a teenager because I liked Zorro and Johnny Cash. And then suddenly in New York it was like: \u2018Oh, he\u2019s a hipster.\u2019 That\u2019s just hilarious to me.\u201d</p> <p>He thinks it over. \u201cI mean, I suppose I\u2019ve always thought from when I was a teenager that how you look and how you dress must reflect something about you. But I paid a lot more attention to it back then, when I was in Ohio, than I do now, because I just kind of stuck with it. I haven\u2019t really changed.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/28/zombie-movies-ranked\">Zombie movies \u2013 ranked!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When he first landed in New York, he wanted to be a poet or a musician, whichever came easier. More than anything he wanted to immerse himself, reinvent himself, put as much distance as possible between himself and Akron. It\u2019s tempting to compare him to Andy Warhol, another escapee from the rust belt, or F Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s Jay Gatsby, a gorgeous series of successful gestures. Actually, he says, Manhattan at the time wasn\u2019t much prettier than Cuyahoga Falls with its poisonous river. This was 1977, the year of the blackout, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/apr/26/summer-sam-spike-lee\" title=\"\">Summer of Sam</a>; graffiti sprayed across the subway cars and the entire city on the verge of bankruptcy. But it was also a good time, a creative seedbed; the streets thrumming to the crosstown traffic of hip-hop and punk-rock.</p> <p>\u201cIt was dirty, it was dangerous. It was everything I\u2019d dreamed of. And you\u2019d go out at night, and yes, you\u2019d see Andy Warhol. You\u2019d see Ornette Coleman walking by, carrying a fucking horn case. I met [experimental film-maker] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(film_director)\" title=\"\">Jack Smith</a> on the street and he was pushing a baby carriage full of garbage for one of his shows. He gave me a business card that said: \u2018Jack Smith \u2013 exotic theatrical genius.\u2019 I met Nico on the street and she invited me to come and have tea with her at the Chelsea hotel. It was\u2026\u201d He can\u2019t get the words out. \u201cIt was magical. It was amazing. It was \u2013 wow.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c017081261de44ff621ba6664cdb71a1c71cb0a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c017081261de44ff621ba6664cdb71a1c71cb0a1/350_0_3981_2390/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iggy Pop as a zombie in The Dead Don\u2019t Die, directed by Jim Jarmusch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zombie apocalypse: Iggy Pop in The Dead Don\u2019t Die.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jarmusch\u2019s early films were about men and women on the move. The fugitives out of<em> Down </em><em>By Law,</em> the Memphis tourists in <em>Mystery Train</em>, the taxicab passengers from <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102536/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\" title=\"\"><em>Night on Earth</em></a>. Recently, though, his protagonists seem to be slowing down, circling towards rest, like the jaded Detroit vampires from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/23/only-lovers-left-alive-review\" title=\"\"><em>Only Lovers Left Alive</em></a>. In 2016, he ventured out to Paterson, New Jersey, the former home of the poet <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-carlos-williams\" title=\"\">William Carlos Willams</a>, to make what was arguably his simplest, most personal picture. <em>Paterson</em> spun the tale of a serene, bus-driving poet who folds the creation of great art into his daily routine.

      "bodyText": "Cuyahoga Falls is a middle-class suburb of industrial Akron, Ohio, a grid of leafy streets and comfortable homes bordered by the river. When Jim Jarmusch was a boy, he knew to steer clear of the water because, while the town might be placid, the Cuyahoga river was toxic. Pickling acids had stained it bright orange. Factory detergents had put a white froth on its surface. In June 1969, a spark from a train set the Cuyahoga alight and the flames jumped as high as a five\u2011storey building. Fifty years on, Jarmusch remembers it well. \u201cIt was not a pleasant thing to happen,\u201d he says with the droll understatement that has become his signature style. \u201cIn fact, if you\u2019re looking for a metaphor of modern American life, it doesn\u2019t get more blatant than having your local river catch fire.\u201d As a film-maker, Jarmusch likes to make movies about the world\u2019s little details; about drifters and seekers and the rambling detours that add up to a life. It\u2019s an area of interest that has served him well, from 1984\u2019s meandering, monochrome Stranger Than Paradise through to 2016\u2019s soulful, meditative Paterson. But it\u2019s hard to focus on the small pictures when the big one is so scary: when a river is burning or the whole planet\u2019s aflame. He says: \u201cIt\u2019s clear we\u2019re living in an ecological crisis and the situation is getting worse and worse. We\u2019re threatened by the denial of science and by corporate greed. If this is the path that we keep going down, then it is only going to lead to the end of the world.\u201d I first run into Jarmusch on the backstreets of Cannes in May this year, where his latest work, The Dead Don\u2019t Die, opens the film festival as climate crisis protesters gather beside the Palais. A few weeks later I speak to him again on the phone at his house in upstate New York. He explains that while he maintains a bolt-hole in his adopted Manhattan, these days he prefers living out in the Catskills. He shares the house with his partner of four decades, the actor and film-maker Sara Driver. \u201cThis is family time,\u201d the 66-year-old says. \u201cI guess you could say I\u2019m up here to recover.\u201d The alternative view is that he\u2019s hiding out in the woods; the silver fox of independent cinema lying low, gone to ground. If the apocalypse is pending, The Dead Don\u2019t Die shows the way it might go, with polar fracking warping the planet\u2019s axis, Trump-supporting racists spinning on their bar-stools, and an army of zombies shuffling up main street. Jarmusch keeps referring to the film as a comedy \u2013 pretty funny, plenty of jokes \u2013 but his sales patter carries a plaintive note. He knows the film is not as frothy as he meant it to be. He sighs. \u201cThe tone is different from what I anticipated. It\u2019s a whole lot darker than I imagined, especially the ending. I try not to analyse these things too much, but that\u2019s reflective of the world we\u2019re in; the looming environmental crisis just became more and more of a cloud. I was working on this film for two years, and during that time it was as if the planet was changing on an almost daily basis.\u201d Small wonder that the finished movie pulls in different directions and seems almost at war with itself. The tale sets forth as a jaunty, knowing deconstruction of the zombie genre, only to be caught in the crossfire of fatalism and despair. \u201cThis whole thing\u2019s going to end badly,\u201d warns Adam Driver\u2019s small-town cop as the walking dead descend on Centerville, calling out for coffee and wifi, chardonnay and Xanax. The cast\u2019s an amiable ragbag of Jarmusch\u2019s buddies and collaborators. There\u2019s Bill Murray, Tilda Swinton, an undead Iggy Pop. Tom Waits co-stars as Hermit Bob, a rackety old recluse who lives in the forest and survives on squirrels and bugs. He knows what\u2019s coming and accepts it with a shrug. \u201cThe world is fucked-up,\u201d he informs us at the end. The film was shot near Jarmusch\u2019s home, around the neighbouring towns of Kingston and Fleischmanns. This ought to have made the production simple, but somehow did not. The schedule was a nightmare; they only had Driver for three weeks. On top of that, it rained constantly. The director came down with the flu and broke a toe on the set. \u201cAnd then we had to rush to get the thing finished so that we could give it to Cannes.\u201d I have the sense that he\u2019s still trying to figure out what he\u2019s made. \u201cI mean, I wouldn\u2019t have changed the film at all. But I would probably have had more time to think about just what I was doing. It slipped out of my hands like a little child on the riverbank.\u201d As a kid back in Akron, Jarmusch dreamed of slipping away, too. The place was too small, too conservative. Everyone worked for the rubber companies: his dad for BF Goodrich, his uncle for Goodyear, his neighbour for Firestone. His mum, Betty French, had been an arts reporter for the Akron Beacon Journal. She reviewed the young Marlon Brando in the Broadway production of A Streetcar Named Desire and covered the Hollywood wedding of Bogart and Bacall. But when she got married, she jacked in the day job and tucked herself away in a small upstairs office at home. Jarmusch remembers the sound of her picking away on an old Royal typewriter, turning out freelance articles for a local antiques magazine. He credits his mother for sparking an early interest in art, music and film. But he also drew inspiration from a more lurid source. The \u201cghost-host\u201d Ghoulardi was a costumed presenter who introduced B-movies on Cleveland\u2019s JWJ-TV station. The Dead Don\u2019t Die contains a Ghoulardi poster in homage. \u201cWell, he was a really important cultural figure,\u201d Jarmusch explains, deadpan. \u201cHe had a TV show on Friday nights at 11.30 where he would show sci-fi, horror or monster films \u2013 mainly monster films. And he did all kinds of crazy stuff in between. He was this beatnik kind of guy with a goatee, dressed in a white lab coat with a fright wig, dark glasses with one lens missing. He used a lot of hipster catchphrases that were all made up. He\u2019d explode model cars with cherry bombs and he had this early kinescopic effect where he would briefly place himself inside the film he was showing. So yeah, if you ask anyone who grew up in north-eastern Ohio in the 60s, we\u2019re all familiar with Ghoulardi and his influence on us. I think Chrissie Hynde still has her original Ghoulardi T-shirt.\u201d He pauses. \u201cYou know who Ghoulardi\u2019s son is, right?\u201d As it happens, I do. Ghoulardi was played by a TV announcer called Ernie Anderson who would later father Paul Thomas Anderson, the director of Magnolia, Boogie Nights and Phantom Thread. \u201cI\u2019ve only met Paul once, and the first thing I said to him was: \u2018Your dad was Ghoulardi!\u2019 He kind of rolled his eyes about it, but I mean, come on, that was my young bohemian dream \u2013 a weird dad like Ghoulardi.\u201d Except why stop with Ghoulardi? Jarmusch is a pop-culture sponge. He soaks up pretty much everything and likes to quote Joe Strummer\u2019s old motto: \u201cNo input, no output.\u201d His films are made up of secondhand odds and sods, twisted to fit his own sensibility, possibly his own image. I tell him that they\u2019re distinctive and stylish, sometimes to a fault. \u201cWell, style is very important,\u201d he says, unperturbed. \u201cIt\u2019s what Martin Scorsese says differentiates all film-makers. Style is the important identifier of someone\u2019s personal expression.\u201d Hitchcock once said that drama is life with the dull bits cut out. But Jarmusch\u2019s films seem expressly designed to test that maxim, turn it upside down. They glide over scenes that might form the centrepiece of a more conventional picture and salvage incidentals from the cutting-room floor. On his 1986 breakthrough, Down By Law, he rustled up a jailbreak drama that ignored the jailbreak. On the 1995 western Dead Man, he took a perverse delight in finding the most humdrum locations in Oregon and Arizona. At their best, his pictures are ruminative and poetic all-American stories that move with the unhurried pace of Asian arthouse cinema, or postcards from obscure places, complete with doodled footnotes. Reviewing 1989\u2019s Mystery Train, Roger Ebert wrote: \u201cThe best thing about the film is that it takes you to an America you feel you ought to be able to find for yourself if you only knew where to look.\u201d Naturally, Jarmusch says, the films are a reflection of him. \u201cI know I have a laconic approach, time-wise. I know I talk kind of slowly. I probably think kind of slowly. I like slow music. I like slow films. That\u2019s just inherent. Godard said that every film-maker makes the same film over and over. That\u2019s probably true in my case.\u201d Let\u2019s talk about his personal style. That has remained a constant, too. Jarmusch\u2019s hair began to whiten when he was in his mid-teens, round about the time that the Cuyahoga caught fire, with the result that he barely seems to have changed over the ensuing half-century. Compare a picture from the 80s with the Jarmusch of today and it\u2019s hard to spot the difference. He has the same fine, handsome features, the same space-age quiff, the same dark charisma. In photographs, whether intentionally or not, he always appears to be striking a pose. It\u2019s as though he views himself as a frontman for the pictures that he makes. But the suggestion makes him snort. The surest way to prick his aura of pristine cool is to ask about his aura of pristine cool. \u201cI find that a ridiculous idea,\u201d he says. \u201cMy personal style, how I look and dress \u2013 I don\u2019t consider that to be a part of my art. It reminds me of when I was starting out and people would say: \u2018Oh my God, he wears black clothes and dyes his hair white and he makes black-and-white films. What a pretentious asshole.\u2019 Whereas none of these things was related to me. My hair was prematurely white. I started wearing black as a teenager because I liked Zorro and Johnny Cash. And then suddenly in New York it was like: \u2018Oh, he\u2019s a hipster.\u2019 That\u2019s just hilarious to me.\u201d He thinks it over. \u201cI mean, I suppose I\u2019ve always thought from when I was a teenager that how you look and how you dress must reflect something about you. But I paid a lot more attention to it back then, when I was in Ohio, than I do now, because I just kind of stuck with it. I haven\u2019t really changed.\u201d When he first landed in New York, he wanted to be a poet or a musician, whichever came easier. More than anything he wanted to immerse himself, reinvent himself, put as much distance as possible between himself and Akron. It\u2019s tempting to compare him to Andy Warhol, another escapee from the rust belt, or F Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s Jay Gatsby, a gorgeous series of successful gestures. Actually, he says, Manhattan at the time wasn\u2019t much prettier than Cuyahoga Falls with its poisonous river. This was 1977, the year of the blackout, the Summer of Sam; graffiti sprayed across the subway cars and the entire city on the verge of bankruptcy. But it was also a good time, a creative seedbed; the streets thrumming to the crosstown traffic of hip-hop and punk-rock. \u201cIt was dirty, it was dangerous. It was everything I\u2019d dreamed of. And you\u2019d go out at night, and yes, you\u2019d see Andy Warhol. You\u2019d see Ornette Coleman walking by, carrying a fucking horn case. I met [experimental film-maker] Jack Smith on the street and he was pushing a baby carriage full of garbage for one of his shows. He gave me a business card that said: \u2018Jack Smith \u2013 exotic theatrical genius.\u2019 I met Nico on the street and she invited me to come and have tea with her at the Chelsea hotel. It was\u2026\u201d He can\u2019t get the words out. \u201cIt was magical. It was amazing. It was \u2013 wow.\u201d Jarmusch\u2019s early films were about men and women on the move. The fugitives out of Down By Law, the Memphis tourists in Mystery Train, the taxicab passengers from Night on Earth. Recently, though, his protagonists seem to be slowing down, circling towards rest, like the jaded Detroit vampires from Only Lovers Left Alive. In 2016, he ventured out to Paterson, New Jersey, the former home of the poet William Carlos Willams, to make what was arguably his simplest, most personal picture. Paterson spun the tale of a serene, bus-driving poet who folds the creation of great art into his daily routine. Jarmusch shot the film on location. He dragged his camera past the nail bars, pizza joints, factories and the river. Somewhere along the way, it struck him that Paterson, New Jersey, was a lot like Akron, Ohio \u2013 and that in making the film he was, in a sense, coming home. Paterson garnered some of the best reviews of the director\u2019s career. It was seen as heartfelt and pure; weightless and transcendent. The Dead Don\u2019t Die has prompted a more sniffy response. But that\u2019s OK, Jarmusch insists. He knows his films have a tendency to split an audience. What some see as beautiful and strange others regard as artificial and contrived. He\u2019s given up worrying about being misunderstood. Jarmusch says: \u201cHere\u2019s the thing: the dilemma for all film-makers. The beauty of cinema is that you\u2019re basically walking into Plato\u2019s cave. You\u2019re going into a darkened room and entering a world you don\u2019t know anything about. You\u2019re going on a journey and you don\u2019t know what to expect.\u201d He pauses. \u201cBut if you\u2019ve written the script and raised the money and shot the film and then sat in the editing suite for six months, then you are not going to be able to walk into that world.

That\u2019s true of every movie; it\u2019s true of every person. \u201cJust look at me. I feel very strongly about the state of the planet. I find the actions of Greta Thunberg and Extinction Rebellion to be very moving. But I\u2019m also making a film that\u2019s intended as genre entertainment. I drive a fossil-burning vehicle. I use credit cards and plastic. So what do I do? Is it only black or white? Am I only part of the problem or part of the solution?\u201d He doesn\u2019t know, he\u2019s at a loss. \u201cI\u2019m not for negativity. I\u2019m not a fatalist. I\u2019m for the survival of beauty. I\u2019m for the mystery of life.\u201d I ask if he gets back to Ohio much these days and he says he doesn\u2019t \u2013 there\u2019s not much reason to visit. His mother died about a year ago; he had to go back then, to arrange the sale of her house.

Shot in black and white on a budget of $125,000,the film won the Cam\u00e9ra d\u2019Or award at Cannes and pointed the way ahead for US independent cinema. 1989: Mystery Train The director\u2019s fascination with US pop culture peaked with Mystery Train, a colourful Memphis portmanteau, paradoxically bankrolled with Japanese cash. The film\u2019s winding course leads from the station to the dive bars to the insalubrious lobby of the Arcade hotel, where Screamin\u2019 Jay Hawkins\u2019s night clerk keeps a baleful eye on the foreign tourists. 1995: Dead Man The hidebound American western took on a strange and bewitching new form with Dead Man, a tale of manifest destiny turned in on itself, seeing visions on the prairie and sandblasted by Neil Young\u2019s elemental guitar score. Robert Mitchum gave his career swansong as a corroded 19th-century industrialist, while Johnny Depp headlined as wonky William Blake, a runaway accountant with a bullet lodged beside his heart. 2014: Only Lovers Left Alive Jarmusch confesses that he\u2019s always been more of a vampire man than a zombie fan. He loves their refinement, their beauty, their decadent nocturnal existence. With Only Lovers Left Alive (starring Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddleston) he laid on a vampire film of his own, gliding around the exotic ruins of Detroit and trailing clouds of glory. Critics, inevitably, were keen to frame it as a thinly-veiled self-portrait. 2016: Paterson Each day, Adam Driver\u2019s modest young bus driver sets off on his route. Each day, he writes pure, simple poetry inside his notebook. Paterson tells us that routine is important, that small is beautiful and that the creation of art is as natural as breathing. It\u2019s a film that \u2013 to misquote William Blake \u2013 sees the world in a bus timetable and heaven in the tatty old streets of a humdrum industrial town.",

      "body": "<p>Have you heard of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/13/robots-human-uncanny-valley\" title=\"\">uncanny valley</a>? If not, let me say straight away, before you get at all excited, that it\u2019s an IT thing. It\u2019s a theory in robotics that just happens to have an evocative name. The valley it refers to, far from being a magical land between Narnia and the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Big-Rock-Candy-Mountain-hills-Utah\" title=\"\">Big Rock Candy Mountain</a>, where everything\u2019s a bit weird and the fish fly and the bees swim, is actually just a valley shape on a graph. A flattish asymmetrical U. Specifically, a dip in how positive people\u2019s reaction to a robot tends to be as its appearance becomes more human.</p> <p>The theory is that, in general, as robots look more human, we self-obsessed humans like it more and more, so the line of the graph goes up. Until, that is, the robots are nearly identical to humans. Then our approval dips into the uncanny valley, because we suddenly find it creepy, like watching a bee swim. Until, again, the robots become even more humanlike, and indistinguishable from real people, when our approval rises once more at the comforting sight of what we mistake for our own kind. This provides the other side of the metaphorical valley.</p> <p>This notion has been knocking around since the late 70s, but is now backed up by scientific evidence. Some neuroscientists and psychologists in Britain and Germany have been doing fMRI scans of people\u2019s brains while they reacted to images of robots and, <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-07/uoc-stt062619.php\" title=\"\">according to Dr Fabian Grabenhorst</a> of the University of Cambridge, \u201cWe were surprised to see that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex responded to artificial agents precisely in the manner predicted by the uncanny valley hypothesis.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If Johnson were to lose, that would be a hilarious pratfall that would dwarf his previous attempts to amuse</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s good enough for me. Instinctively, I thought the theory sounded true. In fact, the only thing that surprises me about this outcome is that Grabenhorst says they were surprised. Then again, we don\u2019t know that he was really surprised. I\u2019d be surprised if they were surprised, but perhaps I shouldn\u2019t be surprised that they said they were surprised. It wasn\u2019t Grabenhorst\u2019s brain activity that was being scanned, so he could be faking his surprise to make the findings seem more interesting. Confirming what everyone is already convinced is true is probably an area of research that finds it hard to attract funding.</p> <p>The uncanny valley has got me thinking about the Tory leadership contest and why it is that I hope <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-hunt\" title=\"\">Jeremy Hunt</a> becomes the next prime minister. I mean, that\u2019s quite a thing. I can\u2019t say I ever envisaged hoping that, but I do hope it. I hope it, I hasten to add, merely because it\u2019s the only alternative to Boris Johnson becoming the next prime minister, but it absolutely is the only alternative to that, and hence I hope it. Genuinely. Put me in an fMRI scanner and you\u2019ll see. It\u2019s slightly put me off the whole concept of hope, to be honest. If this is the hope, God save me from the glory.</p> <p>But why do I hope it? Is it because Jeremy Hunt is the marginally more moderate of the two candidates? I don\u2019t think so. They\u2019re both at pains to prove their extreme Brexiter no-deal-embracing credentials with every utterance, now that the hardcore leavers dominating their party have decided that anything less than catastrophically crashing out of the EU is a betrayal of 52% of voters requesting an ordered withdrawal. They\u2019re desperate to be seen to respect what most of the 160,000 Tory members have decided that all 17 million leave voters really meant. Being more moderate in that frothing context profanes the very concept of moderation.</p> <p>Is it because Jeremy Hunt is more honest? I\u2019d say he is undoubtedly more honest than Boris Johnson. But if faint praise can be damning, that\u2019s faint enough to consign him to an eternity in the lowest circle of hell. It means virtually nothing. And, bearing in mind that what Boris Johnson says he\u2019s going to do if he wins is so nonsensical and destructive, the thought that he may be lying is relatively comforting.</p> <p>Is it for sadistic reasons of my own? Partly, yes, I must admit. There\u2019s no doubt that, if Johnson were somehow to lose the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservative-leadership\" title=\"\">leadership election</a> from here, that would be a hilarious pratfall in public life that would dwarf his previous attempts to amuse. After all his careless, self-interested opportunism, the pain and embarrassment that he would feel, would be a balm to soothe me through the first disastrous months of the Hunt administration.</p> <p>Still, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the main reason. My hunch is that this election will cause Johnson pain either way. He won\u2019t be a good or happy prime minister because he doesn\u2019t really want to do anything except show off. He\u2019s pathologically dishonest and unfaithful, which is fine in showbusiness, but it\u2019s going to screw up his premiership, which will make him very angry because, at heart, he doesn\u2019t believe anyone has the right to question his desires.</p> <p>And look at the state of his life: professionally it\u2019s going OK, but personally, he\u2019s a middle-aged divorc\u00e9, living apart from all of his many children, shouting and spilling wine on the sofa in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/21/police-called-to-loud-altercation-at-boris-johnsons-home\" title=\"\">his girlfriend\u2019s south London flat</a>. It conjures up images of his socks over the radiator and his tablets and foot powder jostling for bathroom shelf space with a young woman\u2019s cosmetics. It\u2019s a bit grim. So I think I\u2019ll get to watch him suffer either way.</p> <p>Fundamentally, I think I hope Hunt wins because Johnson is in the uncanny valley. Hunt is the robot-like creature of politics. With no discernible charm or charisma, he\u2019s the typical forgettable figure by which Westminster has been dominated in recent decades: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/andyburnham\" title=\"\">Andy Burnham</a>, the Milibands, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nickclegg\" title=\"\">Nick Clegg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-hunt\" title=\"\">Jeremy Hunt</a>. The plausible men in plausible suits, platitude-spouting mediocrities, not real people.</p> <p>Johnson has always seemed different \u2013 more fun, more charming, more human. To many \u2013 to me for a while \u2013 this was preferable, more like recognisable flesh and blood. But then at some point, perhaps when he was blathering on about painting cardboard buses, something changed. Like a twinkle of LED behind the automaton\u2019s human face, I glimpsed the icy contempt. The human warmth is fake, and its very similarity to the real thing is offensive and revolting.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Have you heard of the uncanny valley? If not, let me say straight away, before you get at all excited, that it\u2019s an IT thing. It\u2019s a theory in robotics that just happens to have an evocative name. The valley it refers to, far from being a magical land between Narnia and the Big Rock Candy Mountain, where everything\u2019s a bit weird and the fish fly and the bees swim, is actually just a valley shape on a graph. A flattish asymmetrical U. Specifically, a dip in how positive people\u2019s reaction to a robot tends to be as its appearance becomes more human. The theory is that, in general, as robots look more human, we self-obsessed humans like it more and more, so the line of the graph goes up. Until, that is, the robots are nearly identical to humans. Then our approval dips into the uncanny valley, because we suddenly find it creepy, like watching a bee swim. Until, again, the robots become even more humanlike, and indistinguishable from real people, when our approval rises once more at the comforting sight of what we mistake for our own kind. This provides the other side of the metaphorical valley. This notion has been knocking around since the late 70s, but is now backed up by scientific evidence. Some neuroscientists and psychologists in Britain and Germany have been doing fMRI scans of people\u2019s brains while they reacted to images of robots and, according to Dr Fabian Grabenhorst of the University of Cambridge, \u201cWe were surprised to see that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex responded to artificial agents precisely in the manner predicted by the uncanny valley hypothesis.\u201d That\u2019s good enough for me. Instinctively, I thought the theory sounded true. In fact, the only thing that surprises me about this outcome is that Grabenhorst says they were surprised. Then again, we don\u2019t know that he was really surprised. I\u2019d be surprised if they were surprised, but perhaps I shouldn\u2019t be surprised that they said they were surprised. It wasn\u2019t Grabenhorst\u2019s brain activity that was being scanned, so he could be faking his surprise to make the findings seem more interesting. Confirming what everyone is already convinced is true is probably an area of research that finds it hard to attract funding. The uncanny valley has got me thinking about the Tory leadership contest and why it is that I hope Jeremy Hunt becomes the next prime minister. I mean, that\u2019s quite a thing. I can\u2019t say I ever envisaged hoping that, but I do hope it. I hope it, I hasten to add, merely because it\u2019s the only alternative to Boris Johnson becoming the next prime minister, but it absolutely is the only alternative to that, and hence I hope it. Genuinely. Put me in an fMRI scanner and you\u2019ll see. It\u2019s slightly put me off the whole concept of hope, to be honest. If this is the hope, God save me from the glory. But why do I hope it? Is it because Jeremy Hunt is the marginally more moderate of the two candidates? I don\u2019t think so. They\u2019re both at pains to prove their extreme Brexiter no-deal-embracing credentials with every utterance, now that the hardcore leavers dominating their party have decided that anything less than catastrophically crashing out of the EU is a betrayal of 52% of voters requesting an ordered withdrawal. They\u2019re desperate to be seen to respect what most of the 160,000 Tory members have decided that all 17 million leave voters really meant. Being more moderate in that frothing context profanes the very concept of moderation. Is it because Jeremy Hunt is more honest? I\u2019d say he is undoubtedly more honest than Boris Johnson. But if faint praise can be damning, that\u2019s faint enough to consign him to an eternity in the lowest circle of hell. It means virtually nothing. And, bearing in mind that what Boris Johnson says he\u2019s going to do if he wins is so nonsensical and destructive, the thought that he may be lying is relatively comforting. Is it for sadistic reasons of my own? Partly, yes, I must admit. There\u2019s no doubt that, if Johnson were somehow to lose the leadership election from here, that would be a hilarious pratfall in public life that would dwarf his previous attempts to amuse. After all his careless, self-interested opportunism, the pain and embarrassment that he would feel, would be a balm to soothe me through the first disastrous months of the Hunt administration. Still, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the main reason. My hunch is that this election will cause Johnson pain either way. He won\u2019t be a good or happy prime minister because he doesn\u2019t really want to do anything except show off. He\u2019s pathologically dishonest and unfaithful, which is fine in showbusiness, but it\u2019s going to screw up his premiership, which will make him very angry because, at heart, he doesn\u2019t believe anyone has the right to question his desires. And look at the state of his life: professionally it\u2019s going OK, but personally, he\u2019s a middle-aged divorc\u00e9, living apart from all of his many children, shouting and spilling wine on the sofa in his girlfriend\u2019s south London flat. It conjures up images of his socks over the radiator and his tablets and foot powder jostling for bathroom shelf space with a young woman\u2019s cosmetics. It\u2019s a bit grim. So I think I\u2019ll get to watch him suffer either way. Fundamentally, I think I hope Hunt wins because Johnson is in the uncanny valley. Hunt is the robot-like creature of politics. With no discernible charm or charisma, he\u2019s the typical forgettable figure by which Westminster has been dominated in recent decades: Andy Burnham, the Milibands, Nick Clegg, Jeremy Hunt. The plausible men in plausible suits, platitude-spouting mediocrities, not real people. Johnson has always seemed different \u2013 more fun, more charming, more human. To many \u2013 to me for a while \u2013 this was preferable, more like recognisable flesh and blood. But then at some point, perhaps when he was blathering on about painting cardboard buses, something changed. Like a twinkle of LED behind the automaton\u2019s human face, I glimpsed the icy contempt. The human warmth is fake, and its very similarity to the real thing is offensive and revolting.",

      "body": "<h2>The Palestinian and the Israeli</h2> <p><em>Jalil </em><em>Dabit</em> At the age of 12 I started my mornings with a strong coffee at my father\u2019s restaurant. It was decided that if I was old enough to open the place up at 5am, I was old enough to drink with him. And so I did.</p> <p>Back in 1942, my grandfather founded our traditional Arabic eatery in Ramla, the small town we call home, nestled between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. As he grew old, my father took over. I helped him for four years before finally being invited into the kitchen at 16. I spent my adolescence cleaning, carrying water and prepping. One day my dad said: \u201cJalil, come here, I will teach you how to make hummus.\u201d</p> <p>Food wasn\u2019t just our livelihood, though, it was a way of bringing people together. Every year we\u2019d hold a party for Arabs and Israelis at a nearby kibbutz called Gezer. Muslims, Christians, Jews were all invited to talk, to eat and to dance. We\u2019d bring trays of salads, meats and stuffed vegetables. My father was a man of food and a man of peace \u2013 the two most precious gifts that he gave to me.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We have shown that we can work together. There's no better way to do that than through food</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My parents had sent me to a Jewish public school \u2013 it was better than the Arab one and they wanted the best for me. I was the only Arab pupil. I remained proud of my identity. I never changed my name, or hid my connection to my community. I didn\u2019t agree with their politics, but they were still people.</p> <p>I moved to Berlin four years ago and wanted to open a restaurant. I eat a lot of hummus, and everywhere I tried it I thought I could do it so much better. Sadly, it just wasn\u2019t quite coming together. And then I met Oz.</p> <p>We had a shared vision, even though his background is so different to mine. We began importing tahini to sell to retailers and at markets, the same product my father sold in Israel and Palestine. When we told people that I was Palestinian and Oz was Israeli, their eyes lit up: \u201cYes,\u201d they\u2019d say, \u201clet\u2019s do it.\u201d Then I knew we could open a restaurant.</p> <p>Israelis and Palestinians in Germany have more in common than what divides them. We have coffee, hospitality, hummus \u2013 we can both be treated as foreign or the \u201cother\u201d. At home, division defines our relationships, but here? It\u2019s about what we share. At our restaurant <a href=\"https://www.kanaan-berlin.de/en\" title=\"\">Kanaan</a>, we have showed Berliners that Oz and I could work together \u2013 a gay Israeli and a straight Palestinian, with a staff of migrants, LGBTQ+ people and locals. If we can do it, why can\u2019t everyone else? There\u2019s no better way to do that than through food.</p> <p><em>Oz Ben </em><em>David</em>The food I bring to Kanaan is the food I grew up with; flavours that bring back memories of my childhood in Israel. My teenage years were spent in Ariel, an Israeli settlement 20km into the West Bank, at the heart of the Israeli occupation. At night we patrolled the village, then in its chaotic early years. Stones were thrown as we passed Palestinians who\u2019d lit fires in protest. I remember being on a bus aged 16 and demanding a Palestinian man show me \u2013 a child \u2013 his ID, and starting a fight with him because he wouldn\u2019t. You\u2019ve no idea how much I regret it now.</p> <p>I joined the army at 18. The life I built up didn\u2019t feel like my own \u2013 it was just what my parents wanted. After my first gay experience in Ibiza I realised I didn\u2019t want to spend my life armed, traversing the tunnels around Gaza.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Food is a history book and we want to write a joint one</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Today I can\u2019t connect to my early life much through politics or shared values, so I\u2019m doing it through food. My father\u2019s family are Romanian, my mother\u2019s Moroccan \u2013 it made for an interesting combination of couscous and stuffed cabbages at Shabbat meals. That\u2019s the magic of the cuisine I know \u2013 it\u2019s the coming together of the unexpected. </p> <p>We are proud to have such a mix of people working here: Syrian, Kurdish, Turkish, Iranian, Iraqi and Israeli, Germans, Italians, and others from Sudan, Eritrea and Chad. And our customers seem to like it, too \u2013 business is good. People come for good food, but they stay for the open atmosphere and the welcoming experience. Jalil and I talk politics, although it very rarely gets heated. We agree on the fundamentals: Israel has a right to be a country, Palestine should be an independent state afforded the chance to build its own future and legacy, too. We believe that women should be leading the pursuit of peace in the region. </p> <p>Our place is called Kanaan because that\u2019s what the land was called before it became Israel and Palestine. In those days we were all under one tent: one family. That approach informs all we do here. When we started out, I wanted to design dishes the Israeli way; for Jalil it was Palestinian. But we began to share our secrets: how my grandmother made hummus, his shakshuka. We realised it wasn\u2019t right for us to make a dish which would make the Israeli or Palestinian side happy. Instead, we had to find a way that could keep both his and my parents pleased if they sat down to eat. Food is a history book, and we want to write a joint one.<br><em><a href=\"https://www.kanaan-berlin.de/en\" title=\"\">kanaan-berlin.de</a></em></p> <h2>The Greek and Turkish Cypriots</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f95e4f30d0132624081c309eafddf1e0dfc7a52\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f95e4f30d0132624081c309eafddf1e0dfc7a52/0_219_6583_3950/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Feray Yalcuk and Maria Loucaidou sitting side by side and smiling, on a wall with grafitti on it and with a shabby building with broken shutters behind them\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Cyprus will unite one day, and it\u2019ll be communities who build those bridges\u2019: (from left) Feray Yalcuk and Maria Loucaidou at Home Caf\u00e9.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yiannis Kourtoglou/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Maria Loucaidou</em><strong> </strong>My mother was 15 when she became a refugee. War forced her parents to leave their home in the north of the island. It was 1974 when Turkey invaded Cyprus, and they\u2019ve occupied the north ever since. I was born in the south, so grew up hearing stories of the life she had before displacement. My mother would cry as she told us about her early years: her village, the smell of the orange trees as they bloomed, how the family all cooked together. At home, what we ate became a physical connection to a time before the conflict.</p> <p>I had nightmares about Turkish Cypriots \u2013 that they would come and take over the island. I was traumatised. Then the border opened in 2003. My mother and I travelled north together for the first time. When we found my grandmother\u2019s old house, strangers opened the door. We sat with them. It was the first time I met a Turkish Cypriot \u2013 they drank the same coffee, had similar complexions and similarly shaped noses. I couldn\u2019t believe they were just like us.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We first bonded over a love of food</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Five years ago I quit my job as an architect and came to work at the <a href=\"http://www.home4cooperation.info/cafe\" title=\"\">Home Caf\u00e9</a> in the United Nations-controlled buffer zone in Nicosia, which separates north and south. I started out as a barista, but now I run the kitchen. I got to know Feray quickly when we began working together \u2013 our caf\u00e9 is small, and the kitchen smaller. We now manage the caf\u00e9 as a team and we often cook together. She is the first Turkish Cypriot I have got to know well and it turns out our cultures have so much in common, although it was a mutual love of food we first bonded over. We cook traditional food \u2013 dolma, souvla, kolokasi \u2013 but I always get Feray\u2019s opinion on flavours. Both Turkish and Greek Cypriots come into the caf\u00e9, so I try to satisfy both tastes. She\u2019ll tell me when to put more sumac into a dish, because us Greeks don\u2019t use it, or more chilli. Not long ago Feray\u2019s grandmother sent my parents a traditional Turkish dish to try across the border. There were tears when our families spoke on the phone as they reminisced about a more peaceful time.</p> <p>Sometimes customers come in and ask for a Turkish coffee, others ask for the Greek version. Feray and I always laugh and tell them they\u2019re exactly the same thing, and we call it Cypriot coffee here.</p> <p><em>Feray Yalcuk</em><strong> </strong>You could say my daily commute to work is quite out of the ordinary. I used to have to show my ID to the police to be allowed across the border and into the buffer zone, but they know me now and just wave me through. There\u2019s not much here, beside the small hotel opposite, now home to United Nations peacekeepers. And then there\u2019s our caf\u00e9 \u2013 being in no man\u2019s land sort of makes it a place for everybody.</p> <p>Both my parents were born in the south of the island, but left during the war, aged four and six, to head north. Just like Maria, once the border opened our family went to see their old home. We, too, sat and drank coffee with the strangers who\u2019d replaced us. It was less traumatic for me and for my parents. They were too young to remember much.</p> <p>Before Maria I\u2019d never had a close relationship with a Greek Cypriot. We might speak a different language, but our experiences are almost identical. It\u2019s the same with food \u2013 it\u2019s important for all Cypriots. We plan our day according to our meals \u2013 we never go for drinks with friends, but to eat.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Being in no man\u2019s land makes our caf\u00e9 a place for everyone</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When we were children, Greek Cypriots were presented to us as monsters. Even if I\u2019d wanted to meet young people from their side it would have been impossible \u2013 we spoke different languages and the border may have been open, but children needed special permission to go over alone.</p> <p>Maria is the first Greek Cypriot I\u2019ve come to know well. We\u2019ve proved to ourselves that the tensions we may have once felt do not need to exist. From time to time we speak about politics, although that can feel awkward. We\u2019ve discussed the occupation and how it impacted Maria\u2019s family, but we\u2019re looking to the future. Cyprus will unite one day, but not because leaders signed a piece of paper. It\u2019ll be communities who build those bridges \u2013 that\u2019s our focus.</p> <p>Turkish, Greek and English are all spoken in the caf\u00e9 \u2013 it means anyone who steps in can know they\u2019ll be understood and, where possible, we use names for dishes that all three languages have in common, like mujaddara, a staple of lentils and rice. Maria and I are a team \u2013 she\u2019s taught me what that really means. When she\u2019s making chicken souvlaki I make the cacik (a dish of yogurt, cucumber, dry mint, garlic and olive oil) to go alongside.</p> <p>Sometimes, visitors walking by ask whether they\u2019re in Turkey or Greece. \u201cWe\u2019re in Cyprus,\u201d I\u2019ll tell them, \u201cin the buffer zone \u2013 neither south nor north.\u201d It\u2019s funny, people still think this island belongs to Greece or Turkey. But it doesn\u2019t. It belongs to us.<br><em><a href=\"http://www.home4cooperation.info/cafe\" title=\"\">home4cooperation.info</a></em></p> <h2>The Colombian guerilla and the soldier</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa5dc88f96ce52e268f8b3e991c5a2fdfb3319cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa5dc88f96ce52e268f8b3e991c5a2fdfb3319cc/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Composite pic showing Dulce Maria in the restaurant and Ruben Dario Romero Diaz in the kitchen of El Cielo, Colombia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Once I had a gun in my hand, now I have food\u2019: (from left) Dulce Maria and Ruben Dario Romero Diaz of El Cielo, Colombia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elcielo Restaurant/pr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Ruben Dario Romero Diaz</em><strong> </strong>Dulce Maria was nervous and shy when she first walked into the kitchen, now almost five years ago. She knew that I knew about her time as a member of the Farc militia, a communist guerilla. She knew that I had once served as a Colombian soldier, with the scars to prove it. She and I had been at war. On that first day I told her everything was forgiven, that I was ready for a new start for us both, one where cooking together was our future, and the past was left in the past. She wanted the same. </p> <p>The conflict in Colombia had been raging since the 1960s, between the government, paramilitaries, criminal gangs and guerrillas. The story is complicated. The Farc and other revolutionary groups claimed to be fighting for the rights of ordinary citizens; the government said it was upholding the rule of law. Millions were displaced. If you were fighting there were no friendships across enemy lines. That went without saying. My mother died giving birth to my brother at home when I was four years old. There were guerrillas outside the house, so she couldn\u2019t get to the hospital. We lived in fear all the time.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Colombians have this in common: you can reach us through our stomachs</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My grandmother fed us with love \u2013 that\u2019s the part of cooking I learned from her. At 18 I joined the Colombian army for my own safety. Two years later an explosion in a minefield planted by a guerrilla group left me without a leg, and gravely injured. It forced me to change my path.</p> <p>From a young age, I wanted to be a cook. That was my dream, but I never had the opportunity. I started here at <a href=\"http://elcielorestaurant.com/us/index.php/medellin\" title=\"\">El Cielo</a> in Medell\u00edn, Colombia, under the leadership of our head chef and founder, Juan Manuel Barrientos Valencia. Our restaurant is true fine dining \u2013 one of the best in Latin America. In our kitchen, ex-military personnel are trained and helped to readjust to civilian life. I had to learn to stand for nine hours on my prosthetic leg. After a while it was decided that ex-Farc members would be invited to train, too, in a reconciliation effort. Some colleagues thought I might find that uncomfortable, but I was ready to make a contribution to peace in Colombia. That\u2019s what I needed to show Dulce Maria on her first day and it formed the basis of our strong relationship, which mostly centres on the kitchen, but you come to know someone\u2019s vulnerabilities. I respect her, she has both a strong heart and strong mind. She\u2019s away training in Spain at the moment, and I miss her presence.</p> <p>When we were young we both had dreams and goals, then war came and stole them from us. This war was a conflict where we all are the victims. There\u2019s something else we Colombians all have in common though: you can reach us via our stomachs.</p> <p><em>Dulce Maria</em><strong> </strong>When I arrived for my first day of work I was petrified. I knew I\u2019d be working in the kitchen alongside people from different sides of the conflict. Romero had been mentioned to me in advance \u2013 his injury would be obvious, because he\u2019d lost his leg at the hands of the paramilitaries I fought with. I felt a chill across my body when we were introduced. I didn\u2019t know if I was capable of leaving everything behind.</p> <p>We spoke that day. I told him I was scared, and that I used to be part of the Farc, the people responsible for his disability. There have been more than 10,000 victims of mines since the fighting started. I told him I was sorry. He explained that I should not worry, that he had forgiven from his heart a long time ago and I could count on him as a colleague.</p> <p>I was five years old when the guerrillas killed my dad, even though one of my uncles was a guerrilla chief. I was orphaned and moved to live at a finca \u2013 a ranch full of people who worked in the guerrilla army. I was only a kid, and it was drilled into me that I should fight for them \u2013 that the Colombian military and state was the enemy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Food is healing our old divisions</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s hard to acknowledge this, but I was raped at 14 at the finca. My sister was, too; she was only seven. Soon afterwards I moved away, found a boyfriend and had three children. We separated when I was 27, and so I joined the guerrillas full time. I was active for four-and-a-half years</p> <p>When I first left the Farc, finding work was impossible. I couldn\u2019t afford to feed my children.

He made me understand the conflict on a human level. Now he is like a brother to me: we share a blood bond. He\u2019s also very tidy and I\u2019m very strict when it comes to cleanliness in the kitchen, so we make a good team. Before I left for Spain we worked night shifts together. After service we\u2019d clean, get changed, and walk to the Metro station to head home. I became his walking stick \u2013 he held my shoulder for balance \u2013 and I would tear up, it felt like such a powerful symbol.</p> <p>Once, I had a gun in my hand; now I have food, which can heal our divisions.

      "bodyText": "The Palestinian and the Israeli Jalil Dabit At the age of 12 I started my mornings with a strong coffee at my father\u2019s restaurant. It was decided that if I was old enough to open the place up at 5am, I was old enough to drink with him. And so I did. Back in 1942, my grandfather founded our traditional Arabic eatery in Ramla, the small town we call home, nestled between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. As he grew old, my father took over. I helped him for four years before finally being invited into the kitchen at 16. I spent my adolescence cleaning, carrying water and prepping. One day my dad said: \u201cJalil, come here, I will teach you how to make hummus.\u201d Food wasn\u2019t just our livelihood, though, it was a way of bringing people together. Every year we\u2019d hold a party for Arabs and Israelis at a nearby kibbutz called Gezer. Muslims, Christians, Jews were all invited to talk, to eat and to dance. We\u2019d bring trays of salads, meats and stuffed vegetables. My father was a man of food and a man of peace \u2013 the two most precious gifts that he gave to me. My parents had sent me to a Jewish public school \u2013 it was better than the Arab one and they wanted the best for me. I was the only Arab pupil. I remained proud of my identity. I never changed my name, or hid my connection to my community. I didn\u2019t agree with their politics, but they were still people. I moved to Berlin four years ago and wanted to open a restaurant. I eat a lot of hummus, and everywhere I tried it I thought I could do it so much better. Sadly, it just wasn\u2019t quite coming together. And then I met Oz. We had a shared vision, even though his background is so different to mine. We began importing tahini to sell to retailers and at markets, the same product my father sold in Israel and Palestine. When we told people that I was Palestinian and Oz was Israeli, their eyes lit up: \u201cYes,\u201d they\u2019d say, \u201clet\u2019s do it.\u201d Then I knew we could open a restaurant. Israelis and Palestinians in Germany have more in common than what divides them. We have coffee, hospitality, hummus \u2013 we can both be treated as foreign or the \u201cother\u201d. At home, division defines our relationships, but here? It\u2019s about what we share. At our restaurant Kanaan, we have showed Berliners that Oz and I could work together \u2013 a gay Israeli and a straight Palestinian, with a staff of migrants, LGBTQ+ people and locals. If we can do it, why can\u2019t everyone else? There\u2019s no better way to do that than through food. Oz Ben DavidThe food I bring to Kanaan is the food I grew up with; flavours that bring back memories of my childhood in Israel. My teenage years were spent in Ariel, an Israeli settlement 20km into the West Bank, at the heart of the Israeli occupation. At night we patrolled the village, then in its chaotic early years. Stones were thrown as we passed Palestinians who\u2019d lit fires in protest. I remember being on a bus aged 16 and demanding a Palestinian man show me \u2013 a child \u2013 his ID, and starting a fight with him because he wouldn\u2019t. You\u2019ve no idea how much I regret it now. I joined the army at 18. The life I built up didn\u2019t feel like my own \u2013 it was just what my parents wanted. After my first gay experience in Ibiza I realised I didn\u2019t want to spend my life armed, traversing the tunnels around Gaza. Today I can\u2019t connect to my early life much through politics or shared values, so I\u2019m doing it through food. My father\u2019s family are Romanian, my mother\u2019s Moroccan \u2013 it made for an interesting combination of couscous and stuffed cabbages at Shabbat meals. That\u2019s the magic of the cuisine I know \u2013 it\u2019s the coming together of the unexpected. We are proud to have such a mix of people working here: Syrian, Kurdish, Turkish, Iranian, Iraqi and Israeli, Germans, Italians, and others from Sudan, Eritrea and Chad. And our customers seem to like it, too \u2013 business is good. People come for good food, but they stay for the open atmosphere and the welcoming experience. Jalil and I talk politics, although it very rarely gets heated. We agree on the fundamentals: Israel has a right to be a country, Palestine should be an independent state afforded the chance to build its own future and legacy, too. We believe that women should be leading the pursuit of peace in the region. Our place is called Kanaan because that\u2019s what the land was called before it became Israel and Palestine. In those days we were all under one tent: one family. That approach informs all we do here. When we started out, I wanted to design dishes the Israeli way; for Jalil it was Palestinian. But we began to share our secrets: how my grandmother made hummus, his shakshuka. We realised it wasn\u2019t right for us to make a dish which would make the Israeli or Palestinian side happy. Instead, we had to find a way that could keep both his and my parents pleased if they sat down to eat. Food is a history book, and we want to write a joint one. kanaan-berlin.de The Greek and Turkish Cypriots Maria Loucaidou My mother was 15 when she became a refugee. War forced her parents to leave their home in the north of the island. It was 1974 when Turkey invaded Cyprus, and they\u2019ve occupied the north ever since. I was born in the south, so grew up hearing stories of the life she had before displacement. My mother would cry as she told us about her early years: her village, the smell of the orange trees as they bloomed, how the family all cooked together. At home, what we ate became a physical connection to a time before the conflict. I had nightmares about Turkish Cypriots \u2013 that they would come and take over the island. I was traumatised. Then the border opened in 2003. My mother and I travelled north together for the first time. When we found my grandmother\u2019s old house, strangers opened the door. We sat with them. It was the first time I met a Turkish Cypriot \u2013 they drank the same coffee, had similar complexions and similarly shaped noses. I couldn\u2019t believe they were just like us. Five years ago I quit my job as an architect and came to work at the Home Caf\u00e9 in the United Nations-controlled buffer zone in Nicosia, which separates north and south. I started out as a barista, but now I run the kitchen. I got to know Feray quickly when we began working together \u2013 our caf\u00e9 is small, and the kitchen smaller. We now manage the caf\u00e9 as a team and we often cook together. She is the first Turkish Cypriot I have got to know well and it turns out our cultures have so much in common, although it was a mutual love of food we first bonded over. We cook traditional food \u2013 dolma, souvla, kolokasi \u2013 but I always get Feray\u2019s opinion on flavours. Both Turkish and Greek Cypriots come into the caf\u00e9, so I try to satisfy both tastes. She\u2019ll tell me when to put more sumac into a dish, because us Greeks don\u2019t use it, or more chilli. Not long ago Feray\u2019s grandmother sent my parents a traditional Turkish dish to try across the border. There were tears when our families spoke on the phone as they reminisced about a more peaceful time. Sometimes customers come in and ask for a Turkish coffee, others ask for the Greek version. Feray and I always laugh and tell them they\u2019re exactly the same thing, and we call it Cypriot coffee here. Feray Yalcuk You could say my daily commute to work is quite out of the ordinary. I used to have to show my ID to the police to be allowed across the border and into the buffer zone, but they know me now and just wave me through. There\u2019s not much here, beside the small hotel opposite, now home to United Nations peacekeepers. And then there\u2019s our caf\u00e9 \u2013 being in no man\u2019s land sort of makes it a place for everybody. Both my parents were born in the south of the island, but left during the war, aged four and six, to head north. Just like Maria, once the border opened our family went to see their old home. We, too, sat and drank coffee with the strangers who\u2019d replaced us. It was less traumatic for me and for my parents. They were too young to remember much. Before Maria I\u2019d never had a close relationship with a Greek Cypriot. We might speak a different language, but our experiences are almost identical. It\u2019s the same with food \u2013 it\u2019s important for all Cypriots. We plan our day according to our meals \u2013 we never go for drinks with friends, but to eat. When we were children, Greek Cypriots were presented to us as monsters. Even if I\u2019d wanted to meet young people from their side it would have been impossible \u2013 we spoke different languages and the border may have been open, but children needed special permission to go over alone. Maria is the first Greek Cypriot I\u2019ve come to know well. We\u2019ve proved to ourselves that the tensions we may have once felt do not need to exist. From time to time we speak about politics, although that can feel awkward. We\u2019ve discussed the occupation and how it impacted Maria\u2019s family, but we\u2019re looking to the future. Cyprus will unite one day, but not because leaders signed a piece of paper. It\u2019ll be communities who build those bridges \u2013 that\u2019s our focus. Turkish, Greek and English are all spoken in the caf\u00e9 \u2013 it means anyone who steps in can know they\u2019ll be understood and, where possible, we use names for dishes that all three languages have in common, like mujaddara, a staple of lentils and rice. Maria and I are a team \u2013 she\u2019s taught me what that really means. When she\u2019s making chicken souvlaki I make the cacik (a dish of yogurt, cucumber, dry mint, garlic and olive oil) to go alongside. Sometimes, visitors walking by ask whether they\u2019re in Turkey or Greece. \u201cWe\u2019re in Cyprus,\u201d I\u2019ll tell them, \u201cin the buffer zone \u2013 neither south nor north.\u201d It\u2019s funny, people still think this island belongs to Greece or Turkey. But it doesn\u2019t. It belongs to us. home4cooperation.info The Colombian guerilla and the soldier Ruben Dario Romero Diaz Dulce Maria was nervous and shy when she first walked into the kitchen, now almost five years ago. She knew that I knew about her time as a member of the Farc militia, a communist guerilla. She knew that I had once served as a Colombian soldier, with the scars to prove it. She and I had been at war. On that first day I told her everything was forgiven, that I was ready for a new start for us both, one where cooking together was our future, and the past was left in the past. She wanted the same. The conflict in Colombia had been raging since the 1960s, between the government, paramilitaries, criminal gangs and guerrillas. The story is complicated. The Farc and other revolutionary groups claimed to be fighting for the rights of ordinary citizens; the government said it was upholding the rule of law. Millions were displaced. If you were fighting there were no friendships across enemy lines. That went without saying. My mother died giving birth to my brother at home when I was four years old. There were guerrillas outside the house, so she couldn\u2019t get to the hospital. We lived in fear all the time. My grandmother fed us with love \u2013 that\u2019s the part of cooking I learned from her. At 18 I joined the Colombian army for my own safety. Two years later an explosion in a minefield planted by a guerrilla group left me without a leg, and gravely injured. It forced me to change my path. From a young age, I wanted to be a cook. That was my dream, but I never had the opportunity. I started here at El Cielo in Medell\u00edn, Colombia, under the leadership of our head chef and founder, Juan Manuel Barrientos Valencia. Our restaurant is true fine dining \u2013 one of the best in Latin America. In our kitchen, ex-military personnel are trained and helped to readjust to civilian life. I had to learn to stand for nine hours on my prosthetic leg. After a while it was decided that ex-Farc members would be invited to train, too, in a reconciliation effort. Some colleagues thought I might find that uncomfortable, but I was ready to make a contribution to peace in Colombia. That\u2019s what I needed to show Dulce Maria on her first day and it formed the basis of our strong relationship, which mostly centres on the kitchen, but you come to know someone\u2019s vulnerabilities. I respect her, she has both a strong heart and strong mind. She\u2019s away training in Spain at the moment, and I miss her presence. When we were young we both had dreams and goals, then war came and stole them from us. This war was a conflict where we all are the victims. There\u2019s something else we Colombians all have in common though: you can reach us via our stomachs. Dulce Maria When I arrived for my first day of work I was petrified. I knew I\u2019d be working in the kitchen alongside people from different sides of the conflict.

      "body": "<p>Best known as a co-producer of the TV series <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/26/transparent-review-the-best-thing-on-tv-at-the-moment\" title=\"\">Transparent</a></em>, <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Zackary Drucker</a> is an artist-activist who has devoted her career to making the world less grey and lonely for people who, like her, define themselves as transgender or non-binary. Her photographic and video artwork has been shown at the <a href=\"https://whitney.org/exhibitions/2019-Biennial\" title=\"\">Whitney Biennial</a> in New York, the <a href=\"https://www.labiennale.org/en\" title=\"\">Venice Biennale</a> and nominated for an Emmy. But in one of her most recent projects, she has resorted to direct action, creating an open-access database of pictures available to any media outlet, anywhere in the world, wishing to represent people who don\u2019t fit into traditional gender moulds.</p> <p><a href=\"https://broadlygenderphotos.vice.com/\" title=\"\">The Gender Spectrum Collection</a> was initiated by editors of the news website <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_uk\" title=\"\">Vice</a>, who found there were no quality stock pictures available from photo agencies to illustrate media stories about those who fell outside binary norms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8f254ee9fb4cab7ecc5cd84c04a3a11154a1c85b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f254ee9fb4cab7ecc5cd84c04a3a11154a1c85b/0_0_3840_5760/667.jpg\" alt=\"Photo by Zackary Drucker as part of Broadly\u2019s Gender Spectrum Collection.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere are so few images of trans and gender non-conforming people in stock imagery. Typing transgender into a search engine yields results that are generic \u2013 a white trans woman in front of a trans flag, and that\u2019s pretty much it,\u201d says Drucker. \u201cWe were interested in revealing trans and non-binary people in everyday life: falling in love, taking selfies, gossiping, going to school, waiting for a bus. Our identities are so often sensationalised, but we navigate the world and are embedded in society in ordinary ways.\u201d</p> <p>They signed up 15 models, who are pictured at work and at play in seven categories, from relationships to school, work, health and moods. Provided you are prepared to suspend the preconceptions of the binary world, these are very safe images \u2013 of good-looking young people doing normal things \u2013 with none of the camp wit or edgy eroticism of Drucker\u2019s artwork. And that is precisely the point of them.</p> <p>In a sense, the Gender Spectrum Collection is a mirror of her fabric-printed collages, in which she appropriates images of trans people from vintage magazines. \u201cThe history of gender-diverse people is spread out and not cohesive, so it\u2019s not easy to find,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed that understanding the history and tradition you come from gives you a sense of solidity and strength. These magazines are the closest thing we have to a documentation of our community.\u201d</p> <p>Drucker\u2019s most recent art show, as part of a group exhibition at London\u2019s Gazelli Art House called <em><a href=\"https://gazelliarthouse.com/exhibition/its-not-me-its-you/\" title=\"\">It\u2019s Not Me, It\u2019s </a></em><em><a href=\"https://gazelliarthouse.com/exhibition/its-not-me-its-you/\" title=\"\">You</a></em>, included two films that are a tribute to her mother, Penny Sori, whom she describes as her muse: \u201cShe was really wonderful when I was a young person. I wouldn\u2019t say everything was completely fine, because it\u2019s a learning process and our children teach us how to shepherd them into the world. But so many trans people don\u2019t have the support of their parents, and it makes all the difference in the world to know that you are coming from a place of peace and acceptance.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f49fb08e364426781e56ebd22da97cf98a9c6702\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f49fb08e364426781e56ebd22da97cf98a9c6702/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Photo by Zackary Drucker as part of Broadly\u2019s Gender Spectrum Collection.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>But transitioning from one sex to another is not easy, and Drucker made the point in <a href=\"http://dianerosenstein.com/exhibitions/information/unsparing-quality-curated-by-farrah-karapetian/997/\" title=\"\">a collaboration</a> with a fashion photographer friend, Luke Gilford, for which she was covered with long white hair.

      "bodyText": "Best known as a co-producer of the TV series Transparent, Zackary Drucker is an artist-activist who has devoted her career to making the world less grey and lonely for people who, like her, define themselves as transgender or non-binary. Her photographic and video artwork has been shown at the Whitney Biennial in New York, the Venice Biennale and nominated for an Emmy. But in one of her most recent projects, she has resorted to direct action, creating an open-access database of pictures available to any media outlet, anywhere in the world, wishing to represent people who don\u2019t fit into traditional gender moulds. The Gender Spectrum Collection was initiated by editors of the news website Vice, who found there were no quality stock pictures available from photo agencies to illustrate media stories about those who fell outside binary norms. \u201cThere are so few images of trans and gender non-conforming people in stock imagery. Typing transgender into a search engine yields results that are generic \u2013 a white trans woman in front of a trans flag, and that\u2019s pretty much it,\u201d says Drucker. \u201cWe were interested in revealing trans and non-binary people in everyday life: falling in love, taking selfies, gossiping, going to school, waiting for a bus. Our identities are so often sensationalised, but we navigate the world and are embedded in society in ordinary ways.\u201d They signed up 15 models, who are pictured at work and at play in seven categories, from relationships to school, work, health and moods. Provided you are prepared to suspend the preconceptions of the binary world, these are very safe images \u2013 of good-looking young people doing normal things \u2013 with none of the camp wit or edgy eroticism of Drucker\u2019s artwork. And that is precisely the point of them. In a sense, the Gender Spectrum Collection is a mirror of her fabric-printed collages, in which she appropriates images of trans people from vintage magazines. \u201cThe history of gender-diverse people is spread out and not cohesive, so it\u2019s not easy to find,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed that understanding the history and tradition you come from gives you a sense of solidity and strength. These magazines are the closest thing we have to a documentation of our community.\u201d Drucker\u2019s most recent art show, as part of a group exhibition at London\u2019s Gazelli Art House called It\u2019s Not Me, It\u2019s You, included two films that are a tribute to her mother, Penny Sori, whom she describes as her muse: \u201cShe was really wonderful when I was a young person. I wouldn\u2019t say everything was completely fine, because it\u2019s a learning process and our children teach us how to shepherd them into the world. But so many trans people don\u2019t have the support of their parents, and it makes all the difference in the world to know that you are coming from a place of peace and acceptance.\u201d But transitioning from one sex to another is not easy, and Drucker made the point in a collaboration with a fashion photographer friend, Luke Gilford, for which she was covered with long white hair. In I Am the Lover Inside of You (The Barrier Between Us Too), her hirsute face is intimately probed by surgical-gloved hands; in This Is What It Looks Like (To Go from One Thing to Everything), she lies forlornly in bed, presumably post-operative. But it is another autobiographical project that takes outsiders most deeply into her world. As a man transitioning to a woman, she was in a relationship with a woman transitioning to a man. Her partner, Rhys Ernst, was also an artist, and together they chronicled their six-year relationship in thousands of photographs, a small selection of which were shown at the Whitney Biennial in 2014, and two years later became a book. One of their most moving pictures is a moody-blues tableau in which a topless Drucker flaunts her budding breasts to the camera, her shadow falling across the chest of Ernst, who looks adoringly on, his top lip shaded by a wisp of moustache. It\u2019s such a beautifully composed, tender image that I wonder if they were deliberately recording a second adolescence? Absolutely not, says Drucker. \u201cOur intention was to create images of the pure joy of being seen by each other. But Rhys and I were aware that so few images of trans people loving each other existed in the world. Of course there\u2019s a rich history, but how do you know it exists if there\u2019s no representation?\u201d The couple\u2019s big representational breakthrough came through a connection with Jill Soloway, creator of Transparent. \u201cRhys and I had existed on the periphery of Hollywood in independent queer art circles, and it was the first time anyone had invited us in,\u201d she says. \u201cFor so long, film and television were pandering to the status quo in the hope that it would reach everyone; but the more specific you are, the more it grounds people. Transparent ushered in a golden age where experiences that would have been considered niche became universal.\u201d It was a cultural breakthrough fuelled by the then new technology of streaming, spreading around the world as one of the first hits on Amazon Prime with a healthy presence on social media. In the Gender Spectrum Collection, technology gets its own section, with tableaux ranging from two kids avidly gaming in their living room to lovers reading together from a phone, and neon-haired revellers posing for a group selfie. \u201cSocial media has created this space where we can perform our idealised selves and really tailor and customise what people see and how they see us. It\u2019s a very exciting prospect,\u201d says Drucker. So how does her autobiographical art relate to the selfie culture featured in the collection? \u201cAs an artist with a traditional photography background, I still think of image-making as a more carefully rendered thing, though our visual lexicon is more advanced because of the number of images we see, and that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t take a selfie every now and then and send it to someone,\u201d she says.

But how is uranium enriched?</p> <p>Fresh out of the mine, uranium ore contains about 1% uranium oxide. This is the starting material and it needs some processing. It is treated with chemicals, often strong acids, to extract the oxide and make yellowcake, a powder that contains about 80% uranium oxide.</p> <p>Before the uranium can be used in nuclear reactors or atomic bombs, it has to be enriched. This is because natural uranium contains too little uranium-235, the form of uranium that is easily split to release energy in the process known as fission.</p> <p>Natural uranium contains only 0.7% uranium-235, with the remainder mostly made up of uranium-238. The isotopes differ only in the number of neutrons found in their atoms.

      "bodyText": "Iran has announced plans to enrich uranium beyond the levels allowed under the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal. But how is uranium enriched? Fresh out of the mine, uranium ore contains about 1% uranium oxide. This is the starting material and it needs some processing. It is treated with chemicals, often strong acids, to extract the oxide and make yellowcake, a powder that contains about 80% uranium oxide. Before the uranium can be used in nuclear reactors or atomic bombs, it has to be enriched. This is because natural uranium contains too little uranium-235, the form of uranium that is easily split to release energy in the process known as fission. Natural uranium contains only 0.7% uranium-235, with the remainder mostly made up of uranium-238. The isotopes differ only in the number of neutrons found in their atoms. Uranium-235 atoms have 92 protons and 143 neutrons, whereas uranium-238 atoms have 92 protons and 146 neutrons. To enrich uranium, yellowcake is first turned into a gas called uranium hexafluoride. This is pumped into centrifuges that spin so fast the ever-so-slightly heavier gas containing uranium-238 is forced to the outside, while the lighter gas containing uranium-235 stays in the middle. In enrichment plants, thousands of centrifuges are connected in cascades. Each unit enriches the gas a little and then passes it on to the next centrifuge to enrich some more. The process produces two streams of gas: the enriched \u201cproduct\u201d, which is ultimately used to make fuel or bombs, and the \u201ctails\u201d, known as depleted uranium. The uranium used in nuclear reactors is enriched to about 4% U-235. But for nuclear bombs it must be enriched to about 90%. Under the nuclear deal, Iran is permitted to enrich uranium to 3.67% but now intends to exceed that limit. There is no technical barrier facing the Iranians.

And when phones are also tit windows and porn studios. Yet our relationship with sex remains vaguely tortured, held at arm\u2019s length as if gazed at through varifocals.</p> <p>The latest celebrity is 21-year-old actor Bella Thorne, who tweeted that a hacker was blackmailing her with stolen pictures, but that she was taking her power back \u2013 and she posted the topless photos that had been stolen. By sharing the pictures, she removed the shame, and defused the bomb. Two days later, to much online fury, Whoopi Goldberg chastised her on TV. \u201cIf you\u2019re famous, I don\u2019t care how old you are. You don\u2019t take nude pictures of yourself\u2026 Once you take that picture, it goes into the cloud and it\u2019s available to any hacker who wants it, and if you don\u2019t know that in 2019 this is an issue, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p> <p>And\u2026 Whoopi had a point. She had a point about security, about the ease with which hackers can access data, data that we pay to store, and which we should be able to trust with bank details, bad poetry and even the most pinkly intimate pictures. But it was a small point and one that pointed in a different direction to Thorne\u2019s, and one that she framed in a way that laid blame on the victim. The victim here being, by extension, every person whose body has appeared on the internet without their consent, every girl whose boyfriend has forwarded their picture to his WhatsApp group.</p> <p>And besides, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2019/jun/22/the-rise-of-the-deepfake-and-the-threat-to-democracy\" title=\"\">deepfakes</a> multiply, Thorne\u2019s strategy is no longer viable. This is a problem that\u2019s only going to get worse. Though it\u2019s reported that fewer young people are having sex than in previous generations, far more are having sext. According to the University of Texas Medical Branch, at least 25% of teenagers in the US \u201chave received sexually explicit videos, images or messages on their mobile phone\u201d. Not only is the genie out of the bottle but the bottle has smashed and the glass been trampled with so many boots it\u2019s turned to sand.</p> <p>Last week the Law Commission was asked to examine legislation around the creation and sharing of non-consensual, intimate images. \u201cNo one should have to suffer the immense distress of having intimate images taken or shared without consent,\u201d said the justice minister Paul Maynard. \u201cWe are acting to make sure our laws keep pace with emerging technology and trends in these disturbing and humiliating crimes.\u201d</p> <p>This is one way to remove the bitter threat of revenge porn. But alongside these essential legal updates, Thorne has revealed a way to castrate it, to remove its power. It\u2019s a sport we can all take part in. In a grand act of vanity publishing, everybody should post their nudes. Everybody should upload a variety of photos of a variety of their bottoms, with a view to owning their own bodies and sexualities, and undermining the exploitation of sexual shame, this Furby with teeth.</p> <p>Not me, of course, I don\u2019t have a body, just a small brain and two sharp typing fingers. But everyone else. As the wise sex columnist <a href=\"https://www.thestranger.com/authors/259/dan-savage\" title=\"\">Dan Savage</a> pointed out: \u201cNearly everyone has a few nude photographs out there somewhere (saved on a stranger\u2019s phone; archived on a dating app you forgot you signed up for; lingering on some tech company\u2019s servers). And yet a single solicited dirty pic has the power to end someone\u2019s career.\u201d</p> <p>Undoubtedly, this will not be the case for long \u2013 the person campaigning to become prime minister in 2050, surveying the vinegar-scented rubble of their remaining hamlets, will be no more worried about the impact of their naked pics than the glowing rat nibbling at their shoe. But in order for them to enjoy this freedom, we need to take revenge porn and victim-blaming seriously, and sex itself far less seriously. We need to inoculate ourselves against sexual shame, using honesty, hard words, and yes, our camera phones.

      "body": "<p>The \u201clucky\u201d men in <a href=\"https://www.jamelbrinkley.com/\" title=\"\">Jamel Brinkley</a>\u2019s mighty debut short story collection do not initially appear blessed. Precarious, haunted, wise too long after the event \u2013 all seem more apt descriptions as they share their magnetic tales of abandonment and flight, and of wild nights that demand to be followed to their dawn-streaked ends. They aren\u2019t all men, either; for every fedora-doffing dandy and greying has-been there\u2019s a lost boy or an adolescent whose desire feels a lot like fury. Indeed, it\u2019s the question of what it takes to be a man \u2013 an American man of colour, specifically \u2013 that provides the book\u2019s theme, and though women flit through its pages in various roles, they occupy another realm entirely. The relationships that matter here \u2013 those that define Brinkley\u2019s characters, as often as not by their absence \u2013 are predominantly paternal and fraternal.</p> <p>In several stories, race and gender are shown to be largely performative. In the eerie, indelible opener, No More Than a Bubble, two young Columbia dudes profess a liking for curvy women \u201cbecause that\u2019s what black guys are supposed to like\u201d, and in J\u2019ouvert, 1996, a fatherless boy whose mother has botched his haircut yearns to be in a barbershop, surrounded by \u201cthose clever men, grooming each other\u2019s masculinity\u201d. Later on, the protagonist of Infinite Happiness, an archetypal good guy, confesses to always having been \u201ccaptivated\u201d by men like his flatmate\u2019s lover, a middle-aged charlatan whose talk of African queens and \u201ccerebral vibisms\u201d lets him sleep his way around Brooklyn.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Often, the story we start out reading turns out to be a feint, yet none of this tips over into tricksiness</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mr Good Guy turns out to be not all that he seems, and he isn\u2019t the book\u2019s sole unreliable narrator. \u201cThe story I\u2019ve just told isn\u2019t the only story; it isn\u2019t the real story that needs to be told,\u201d admits Eric, who\u2019s escaped the Bronx to become an adjunct literature professor and the narrator of Everything the Mouth Eats, in which abuse, brotherhood and the Afro-Brazilian martial art <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/mar/17/healthandwellbeing.features4\" title=\"\">capoeira</a> are deftly interwoven.</p> <p>Often, the story we start out reading turns out to be a feint, yet none of this tips over into tricksiness. Whether they\u2019re focused on the racism that\u2019s inherent in a certain kind of charity or the complications of dual heritage identity, these are all urgent, intimate narratives, framed as confessions and quests, and edged with quickening threat. Everything that is good can be ruptured with as little as a single accidental touch, \u201cquiet as two lips parting\u201d, and despite his great feeling for beauty and grace, Brinkley is unafraid to probe the ugliest lows of human behaviour.</p> <p>Throughout, there\u2019s an enigmatic quality to his prose that makes the sharpness of his observations still more dazzling. The truest measure of loneliness, for instance, is the gap between how a person appears to themselves and how they appear to others.</p> <p>These nine near-faultless stories are laden with similarly pocketable treasures, not only heralding the arrival of a fully formed, entirely distinctive new voice but reinvigorating the short story itself. In the end, there\u2019s no doubt who the lucky ones are: we, the readers.</p> <p><em>\u2022 A Lucky Man </em>by Jamel Brinkley<em> </em>is published by Serpent\u2019s Tail (\u00a312.99).

      "bodyText": "The \u201clucky\u201d men in Jamel Brinkley\u2019s mighty debut short story collection do not initially appear blessed. Precarious, haunted, wise too long after the event \u2013 all seem more apt descriptions as they share their magnetic tales of abandonment and flight, and of wild nights that demand to be followed to their dawn-streaked ends. They aren\u2019t all men, either; for every fedora-doffing dandy and greying has-been there\u2019s a lost boy or an adolescent whose desire feels a lot like fury. Indeed, it\u2019s the question of what it takes to be a man \u2013 an American man of colour, specifically \u2013 that provides the book\u2019s theme, and though women flit through its pages in various roles, they occupy another realm entirely. The relationships that matter here \u2013 those that define Brinkley\u2019s characters, as often as not by their absence \u2013 are predominantly paternal and fraternal. In several stories, race and gender are shown to be largely performative. In the eerie, indelible opener, No More Than a Bubble, two young Columbia dudes profess a liking for curvy women \u201cbecause that\u2019s what black guys are supposed to like\u201d, and in J\u2019ouvert, 1996, a fatherless boy whose mother has botched his haircut yearns to be in a barbershop, surrounded by \u201cthose clever men, grooming each other\u2019s masculinity\u201d. Later on, the protagonist of Infinite Happiness, an archetypal good guy, confesses to always having been \u201ccaptivated\u201d by men like his flatmate\u2019s lover, a middle-aged charlatan whose talk of African queens and \u201ccerebral vibisms\u201d lets him sleep his way around Brooklyn. Mr Good Guy turns out to be not all that he seems, and he isn\u2019t the book\u2019s sole unreliable narrator. \u201cThe story I\u2019ve just told isn\u2019t the only story; it isn\u2019t the real story that needs to be told,\u201d admits Eric, who\u2019s escaped the Bronx to become an adjunct literature professor and the narrator of Everything the Mouth Eats, in which abuse, brotherhood and the Afro-Brazilian martial art capoeira are deftly interwoven. Often, the story we start out reading turns out to be a feint, yet none of this tips over into tricksiness. Whether they\u2019re focused on the racism that\u2019s inherent in a certain kind of charity or the complications of dual heritage identity, these are all urgent, intimate narratives, framed as confessions and quests, and edged with quickening threat. Everything that is good can be ruptured with as little as a single accidental touch, \u201cquiet as two lips parting\u201d, and despite his great feeling for beauty and grace, Brinkley is unafraid to probe the ugliest lows of human behaviour. Throughout, there\u2019s an enigmatic quality to his prose that makes the sharpness of his observations still more dazzling. The truest measure of loneliness, for instance, is the gap between how a person appears to themselves and how they appear to others. These nine near-faultless stories are laden with similarly pocketable treasures, not only heralding the arrival of a fully formed, entirely distinctive new voice but reinvigorating the short story itself. In the end, there\u2019s no doubt who the lucky ones are: we, the readers. \u2022 A Lucky Man by Jamel Brinkley is published by Serpent\u2019s Tail (\u00a312.99).

Supermarkets stock biodegradable bags to carry our groceries home, cafes serve coffee in compostable cups, and this year London Marathon runners could refuel with seaweed-based edible bubbles filled with sports drink. But if we just replace one kind of throwaway packaging with another, are we really solving the bigger problem?</p> <p>There\u2019s no denying that we have a plastic crisis on our hands.

Many products described as as \u201ccompostable\u201d actually only break down in industrial composters that maintain high temperatures for weeks at a time. Some are certified for home composting, but how long that takes will depend on the conditions of your individual compost heap. Plastics that are labelled \u201cbiodegradable\u201d typically can\u2019t be composted, but can be broken down by microorganisms \u2013 though the exact method and timescale for this process varies. A recent study found that biodegradable carrier bags could still hold shopping after having been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/29/biodegradable-plastic-bags-survive-three-years-in-soil-and-sea\" title=\"\">buried in soil or left in the sea for three years</a>.</p> <p>Biodegradable plastics can be made from fossil fuels like traditional plastics, but in recent years the focus has been on those made from plants or other renewable resources, collectively called bioplastics.

The problem, says Miodownik, is that there\u2019s no such thing as a sustainable material \u2013 only a sustainable system.

      "body": "<p>It is notorious for champagne-swilling, restaurant-trashing, \u201cpleb\u201d-taunting elitism. Now new light has been shed on the outrageous antics of the Bullingdon Club \u2013 the Oxford University group that may be about to produce its second British prime minister \u2013 by someone intimately connected to it during Boris Johnson\u2019s membership.</p> <p>A woman who acted as a scout for potential members of the Bullingdon Club in the mid-1980s has said that female prostitutes performed sex acts at its lavish dinners, women were routinely belittled, and that intimidation and vandalism were its hallmarks.</p> <p>The woman, who has asked not to be named, is now an academic and regards her involvement with the male-only Bullingdon Club more than 30 years ago with extreme regret and embarrassment.</p> <p>In her first week at Oxford in 1983, she was approached by a member of the club to identify potential recruits \u2013 a role she performed throughout her time as an undergraduate. She also had an 18-month relationship with a man who became a president of the club. In her final year at Oxford, she shared a house with Bullingdon members.</p> <p>Her involvement with the club coincided with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/04/boris-johnson-a-boarding-school-bullingdon-club-vandal\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson\u2019s membership</a> and overlapped with David Cameron\u2019s. She was not a close friend of Johnson but they had a number of good friends in common, she said. She has maintained contact with several former Bullingdon members over the past 30-plus years.</p> <p>\u201cI helped recruit for the Bullingdon, and advised [the president] on its activities,\u201d she told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cI know very well what the patterns of behaviour were. When [her ex-boyfriend] was president, they had prostitutes at their dinners. They performed sex acts, sometimes at the shared dining table, and sometimes elsewhere on the premises.\u201d</p> <p>In 2016, Ralph Perry-Robinson, a Bullingdon member in the mid-1980s, confirmed that prostitutes attended club events. \u201cWe always hire whores\u2026 prostitutes were paid extra by members who wanted to use them,\u201d he told the Daily Beast.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7a002aca2babe12ae66d7620541a1c42811e748\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7a002aca2babe12ae66d7620541a1c42811e748/0_0_1708_1208/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An oil painting of Bullingdon Club members, including Boris Johnson and David Cameron.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"707\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An <a href=\"http://www.ronapainting.com/paintings\">oil painting</a> of Bullingdon Club members, including Boris Johnson and David Cameron (front row, centre).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Painting and photograph: Rona</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The woman said: \u201cThe whole culture was to get extremely drunk and exert vandalism. Every time someone was elected, they had to have their room smashed to pieces. People talk about the Bullingdon Club \u2018trashing\u2019 places, but it was serious criminal damage.\u201d</p> <p>One incident she recalled at Magdalen College involved \u201ca large galleried room that had just been refurbished with expensive wood panelling. Every piece of furniture that could have been broken was broken, every liquid sprayed around the room, the panelling was cracked, and everything was piled in a heap in the middle of the room. The college door to Magdalen was smashed to pieces.</p> <p>\u201cI remember the clerk of works looking at the mess in complete dismay. The college had spent a great deal on the refurbishment. All the students who heard this late-night destruction were terrified, I remember.\u201d</p> <p>Bullingdon members \u201cfound it amusing if people were intimidated or frightened by their behaviour. I remember them walking down a street in Oxford in their tails, chanting \u2018Buller, Buller\u2019 and smashing bottles along the way, just to cow people.\u201d</p> <p>She recalled a party held in a room at Magdalen in the academic year 1985/6 at which guests were invited to \u201ccome as your alter ego\u201d. Two Bullingdon members appeared in Nazi uniforms and \u201cgoose-stepped back and forth in the upstairs galleried area\u201d. They were photographed by a friend of the woman who was taking pictures of the party.</p> <p>\u201cThe next morning [the pair] came round to her room. They barged in and pulled the roll of film out of the camera. She was a feisty character, and told lots of people about this. She died a couple of years ago.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Boris was one of the club\u2019s big beasts. He was up for anything. They treated certain people with absolute disdain.</p> <footer> <cite>Former club recruiter</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The woman who was the club recruiter said: \u201cBoris was one of the big beasts of the club. He was up for anything. They treated certain types of people with absolute disdain, and referred to them as \u2018plebs\u2019 or \u2018grockles\u2019, and the police were always called \u2018plod\u2019. Their attitude was that women were there for their entertainment.\u201d</p> <p>She said there was a \u201cculture of excess\u201d in the 1980s in which the activities of the Bullingdon Club felt \u201cnormalised\u201d. \u201cThey had an air of entitlement and superiority.\u201d</p> <p>Although many former members of the Bullingdon Club \u2013 including Johnson \u2013 have since publicly regretted their involvement in some of its activities, they developed \u201cclose-knit, generational ties,\u201d said the woman. \u201cMany still see each other. They have long-established networks, and they think it\u2019s in their power to confer high office on anyone they choose. There is a bond of loyalty.\u201d</p> <p>The club was founded in 1780 as a hunting and cricket club. Two hundred years later, it was infamous for its distinctive uniform of tailcoats with white silk facings, and its heavy drinking and wild behaviour.</p> <p>In 2013, Johnson \u2013 who reputedly still greets former members with a cry of \u201cBuller, Buller, Buller\u201d \u2013 described it as \u201ca truly shameful vignette of almost superhuman undergraduate arrogance, toffishness and twittishness\u201d.

      "bodyText": "It is notorious for champagne-swilling, restaurant-trashing, \u201cpleb\u201d-taunting elitism. Now new light has been shed on the outrageous antics of the Bullingdon Club \u2013 the Oxford University group that may be about to produce its second British prime minister \u2013 by someone intimately connected to it during Boris Johnson\u2019s membership. A woman who acted as a scout for potential members of the Bullingdon Club in the mid-1980s has said that female prostitutes performed sex acts at its lavish dinners, women were routinely belittled, and that intimidation and vandalism were its hallmarks. The woman, who has asked not to be named, is now an academic and regards her involvement with the male-only Bullingdon Club more than 30 years ago with extreme regret and embarrassment. In her first week at Oxford in 1983, she was approached by a member of the club to identify potential recruits \u2013 a role she performed throughout her time as an undergraduate. She also had an 18-month relationship with a man who became a president of the club. In her final year at Oxford, she shared a house with Bullingdon members. Her involvement with the club coincided with Boris Johnson\u2019s membership and overlapped with David Cameron\u2019s. She was not a close friend of Johnson but they had a number of good friends in common, she said. She has maintained contact with several former Bullingdon members over the past 30-plus years. \u201cI helped recruit for the Bullingdon, and advised [the president] on its activities,\u201d she told the Observer. \u201cI know very well what the patterns of behaviour were. When [her ex-boyfriend] was president, they had prostitutes at their dinners. They performed sex acts, sometimes at the shared dining table, and sometimes elsewhere on the premises.\u201d In 2016, Ralph Perry-Robinson, a Bullingdon member in the mid-1980s, confirmed that prostitutes attended club events. \u201cWe always hire whores\u2026 prostitutes were paid extra by members who wanted to use them,\u201d he told the Daily Beast. The woman said: \u201cThe whole culture was to get extremely drunk and exert vandalism. Every time someone was elected, they had to have their room smashed to pieces. People talk about the Bullingdon Club \u2018trashing\u2019 places, but it was serious criminal damage.\u201d One incident she recalled at Magdalen College involved \u201ca large galleried room that had just been refurbished with expensive wood panelling. Every piece of furniture that could have been broken was broken, every liquid sprayed around the room, the panelling was cracked, and everything was piled in a heap in the middle of the room. The college door to Magdalen was smashed to pieces. \u201cI remember the clerk of works looking at the mess in complete dismay. The college had spent a great deal on the refurbishment. All the students who heard this late-night destruction were terrified, I remember.\u201d Bullingdon members \u201cfound it amusing if people were intimidated or frightened by their behaviour. I remember them walking down a street in Oxford in their tails, chanting \u2018Buller, Buller\u2019 and smashing bottles along the way, just to cow people.\u201d She recalled a party held in a room at Magdalen in the academic year 1985/6 at which guests were invited to \u201ccome as your alter ego\u201d. Two Bullingdon members appeared in Nazi uniforms and \u201cgoose-stepped back and forth in the upstairs galleried area\u201d. They were photographed by a friend of the woman who was taking pictures of the party. \u201cThe next morning [the pair] came round to her room. They barged in and pulled the roll of film out of the camera. She was a feisty character, and told lots of people about this. She died a couple of years ago.\u201d The woman who was the club recruiter said: \u201cBoris was one of the big beasts of the club. He was up for anything. They treated certain types of people with absolute disdain, and referred to them as \u2018plebs\u2019 or \u2018grockles\u2019, and the police were always called \u2018plod\u2019. Their attitude was that women were there for their entertainment.\u201d She said there was a \u201cculture of excess\u201d in the 1980s in which the activities of the Bullingdon Club felt \u201cnormalised\u201d. \u201cThey had an air of entitlement and superiority.\u201d Although many former members of the Bullingdon Club \u2013 including Johnson \u2013 have since publicly regretted their involvement in some of its activities, they developed \u201cclose-knit, generational ties,\u201d said the woman. \u201cMany still see each other. They have long-established networks, and they think it\u2019s in their power to confer high office on anyone they choose. There is a bond of loyalty.\u201d The club was founded in 1780 as a hunting and cricket club. Two hundred years later, it was infamous for its distinctive uniform of tailcoats with white silk facings, and its heavy drinking and wild behaviour. In 2013, Johnson \u2013 who reputedly still greets former members with a cry of \u201cBuller, Buller, Buller\u201d \u2013 described it as \u201ca truly shameful vignette of almost superhuman undergraduate arrogance, toffishness and twittishness\u201d. He added: \u201cBut at the time you felt it was wonderful to be going round swanking it up.\u201d A photograph of club members in their Bullingdon tailcoats taken in 1987 has been repeatedly republished since Cameron became Tory leader. The picture made him \u201ccringe\u201d, he said. \u201cWe all did stupid things when we are young and we should learn the lessons.\u201d Last October, Bullingdon Club members were banned from holding positions in the Oxford University Conservative Association. The association\u2019s president, Ben Etty, said the club\u2019s \u201cvalues and activities had no place in the modern Conservative party\u201d. In recent years, membership has reportedly dwindled to a handful as today\u2019s undergraduates shun an organisation with a toxic reputation. The woman who recruited members in Oxford in the 1980s said that she was horrified at the prospect of Johnson becoming prime minister. \u201cThe characteristics he displayed at Oxford \u2013 entitlement, aggression, amorality, lack of concern for others \u2013 are still there, dressed up in a contrived, jovial image. It\u2019s a mask to sanitise some ugly features.\u201d",

It wasn\u2019t the sparkling waters or pristine beaches that lured him but the desperate faces of migrants featured in newspaper and television reports as they attempted to make the perilous crossing from Libya to Italy.</p> <p>The stretch of sea between the two nations is one of the most popular routes for migrants and refugees to enter Europe, and by the time Rold\u00e1n had finished his stint on board the Iuventa \u2013 the converted fishing boat being run by the German NGO <a href=\"https://jugendrettet.org/en/\" title=\"\">Jugend Rettet</a> \u2013 he had helped <a href=\"https://elpais.com/elpais/2019/03/27/inenglish/1553678880_692129.html\" title=\"\">rescue 5,000 </a>of them.

We tried to do everything legally and came up against a lot of bureaucracy, and that actually cost a lot of migrants their lives. At times they were left to drown because we hadn\u2019t been given permission by the Italians to rescue them.\u201d</p> <p>Despite trying to navigate Italy\u2019s legal territory, Rold\u00e1n and his six other crew members are now facing up to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment after being accused by authorities of aiding illegal immigration and assisting human traffickers. Italian police seized the Iuventa in August 2017 using anti-mafia laws, with a judge ordering an investigation that could result in a trial later this year.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Simply returning migrants to Libya to face more suffering is not the answer.

He also recently addressed the <a href=\"http://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en\" title=\"\">European parliament</a> and is speaking at other events across the continent. His focus was back on Italy, however, following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/29/sea-watch-captain-carola-rackete-arrested-italian-blockade\" title=\"\">the arrest of Carola Rackete</a>, the captain of the rescue ship Sea-Watch 3, which was operated by the Spanish NGO <a href=\"https://www.openarms.es/en\" title=\"\">Open Arms.</a></p> <p>Rackete defied officialdom and forced her way into Lampedusa port to bring 42 migrants ashore and was placed under house arrest. She was freed by a judge last Tuesday, but still faces a possible prison sentence with Italy\u2019s deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, claiming that her actions were \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d. The rightwing minister was responsible for introducing tougher legislation, criticised by the United Nations and campaigners, which has resulted in migrant rescue volunteers facing lengthy jail sentences, fines of up to \u00a314,000 and a \u201cclosed ports\u201d policy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8bcfebd6d41f56a482b91d1818247f752c78934\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8bcfebd6d41f56a482b91d1818247f752c78934/98_154_5382_3229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An NGO migrant rescue operation aboard the Iuventa, in the Mediterranean\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An NGO migrant rescue operation aboard the Iuventa, in the Mediterranean.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zohra Bensemra/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Salvini faces further challenges: yesterday the Alex, another charity rescue boat carrying 41 more shipwrecked migrants, docked at Lampedusa but was prevented from disembarking, while the German charity Sea-Eye\u2019s vessel, Alan Kurdi, arrived in the waters off the island.</p> <p>Rold\u00e1n said: \u201cSaving lives should not be about politics but humanity. NGOs are rescuing migrants because governments have abandoned them. It\u2019s not just about Italy, it\u2019s across Europe. Saving lives is not a crime. Simply returning migrants to Libya to face more suffering is not the answer. Using military ships to keep migrants out is not the answer. Where is the morality in all this?\u201d</p> <p>Last week members of <a href=\"https://www.openarms.es/en\" title=\"\">Open Arms</a> brought one of their rescue ships to the European parliament in Strasbourg to highlight the criminalisation of NGOs rescuing migrants and met MEPs to discuss the issue.</p> <p>Rold\u00e1n, who also carried out rescue missions in the Aegean Sea in 2016, said he was driven to volunteer in the Mediterranean because of the injustice with which migrants are treated and a desire to save lives. He revealed that his most haunting memory was rescuing a mother who was screaming for her baby, which was on a half-sunk ship surrounded by floating bodies. When he went on board he found the baby dead and signalled this to her. He added: \u201cThe look on that mother\u2019s face will live with me for ever. I felt so helpless.\u201d</p> <p>According to recent data from the <a href=\"https://www.unhcr.org/uk/\" title=\"\">UN Refugee Agency</a> (UNHCR) and the <a href=\"https://www.iom.int/\" title=\"\">International Organisation for Migration</a>, 1,940 people have reached Italy from north Africa since the beginning of 2019 and almost 350 have died en route \u2013 putting the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/09/mediterranean-sea-of-blood-migrant-refugee-rescue-boats-un-unhcr\" title=\"\">death rate for those crossing</a> at more than 15%. In total, an estimated 600,000 migrants have made the crossing since 2014, with more than 14,000 reported killed or missing while making the trip.</p> <p>Rold\u00e1n maintains that it is the living and not the dead that keep him awake at night. He said: \u201cThe person who dies is no more; it\u2019s the living who have to cope with all the trauma and rebuild their lives. I always wonder what happens to the people that have been rescued? They\u2019ve gone through terrible ordeals. How do you overcome something like that?\u201d</p> <p>Rold\u00e1n insists that he is not afraid to go to prison, although even \u201cone minute\u201d behind bars would be an injustice. He is barred from entering Italy and the Iuventa remains impounded, but he is adamant that if he is cleared he is heading straight out into the Mediterranean to do what he knows best.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a fireman, I rescue people and save lives. It\u2019s in my blood,\u201d he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was the summer of 2017 and Miguel Rold\u00e1n took 20 days of annual leave from his job as a firefighter and headed to the Mediterranean. It wasn\u2019t the sparkling waters or pristine beaches that lured him but the desperate faces of migrants featured in newspaper and television reports as they attempted to make the perilous crossing from Libya to Italy. The stretch of sea between the two nations is one of the most popular routes for migrants and refugees to enter Europe, and by the time Rold\u00e1n had finished his stint on board the Iuventa \u2013 the converted fishing boat being run by the German NGO Jugend Rettet \u2013 he had helped rescue 5,000 of them. Once he returned to his day job with the underwater unit of the Seville fire department, the remaining crew members went on to rescue another 14,000. \u201cI saw a lot of pain, suffering and death,\u201d recalls Rold\u00e1n. \u201cIt was horrific. We tried to do everything legally and came up against a lot of bureaucracy, and that actually cost a lot of migrants their lives. At times they were left to drown because we hadn\u2019t been given permission by the Italians to rescue them.\u201d Despite trying to navigate Italy\u2019s legal territory, Rold\u00e1n and his six other crew members are now facing up to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment after being accused by authorities of aiding illegal immigration and assisting human traffickers. Italian police seized the Iuventa in August 2017 using anti-mafia laws, with a judge ordering an investigation that could result in a trial later this year. Rold\u00e1n, 32, was in London last week to talk about his experience and what he claims is the criminalisation of NGOs trying to rescue migrants. He also recently addressed the European parliament and is speaking at other events across the continent. His focus was back on Italy, however, following the arrest of Carola Rackete, the captain of the rescue ship Sea-Watch 3, which was operated by the Spanish NGO Open Arms. Rackete defied officialdom and forced her way into Lampedusa port to bring 42 migrants ashore and was placed under house arrest. She was freed by a judge last Tuesday, but still faces a possible prison sentence with Italy\u2019s deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini, claiming that her actions were \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d. The rightwing minister was responsible for introducing tougher legislation, criticised by the United Nations and campaigners, which has resulted in migrant rescue volunteers facing lengthy jail sentences, fines of up to \u00a314,000 and a \u201cclosed ports\u201d policy. Salvini faces further challenges: yesterday the Alex, another charity rescue boat carrying 41 more shipwrecked migrants, docked at Lampedusa but was prevented from disembarking, while the German charity Sea-Eye\u2019s vessel, Alan Kurdi, arrived in the waters off the island. Rold\u00e1n said: \u201cSaving lives should not be about politics but humanity. NGOs are rescuing migrants because governments have abandoned them. It\u2019s not just about Italy, it\u2019s across Europe. Saving lives is not a crime. Simply returning migrants to Libya to face more suffering is not the answer. Using military ships to keep migrants out is not the answer. Where is the morality in all this?\u201d Last week members of Open Arms brought one of their rescue ships to the European parliament in Strasbourg to highlight the criminalisation of NGOs rescuing migrants and met MEPs to discuss the issue. Rold\u00e1n, who also carried out rescue missions in the Aegean Sea in 2016, said he was driven to volunteer in the Mediterranean because of the injustice with which migrants are treated and a desire to save lives. He revealed that his most haunting memory was rescuing a mother who was screaming for her baby, which was on a half-sunk ship surrounded by floating bodies. When he went on board he found the baby dead and signalled this to her. He added: \u201cThe look on that mother\u2019s face will live with me for ever. I felt so helpless.\u201d According to recent data from the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and the International Organisation for Migration, 1,940 people have reached Italy from north Africa since the beginning of 2019 and almost 350 have died en route \u2013 putting the death rate for those crossing at more than 15%. In total, an estimated 600,000 migrants have made the crossing since 2014, with more than 14,000 reported killed or missing while making the trip. Rold\u00e1n maintains that it is the living and not the dead that keep him awake at night. He said: \u201cThe person who dies is no more; it\u2019s the living who have to cope with all the trauma and rebuild their lives. I always wonder what happens to the people that have been rescued? They\u2019ve gone through terrible ordeals. How do you overcome something like that?\u201d Rold\u00e1n insists that he is not afraid to go to prison, although even \u201cone minute\u201d behind bars would be an injustice. He is barred from entering Italy and the Iuventa remains impounded, but he is adamant that if he is cleared he is heading straight out into the Mediterranean to do what he knows best. \u201cI\u2019m a fireman, I rescue people and save lives. It\u2019s in my blood,\u201d he said.",

Those are the people I am fighting for.\u201d</p> <p>She is now an Irish citizen but spoke to the <em>Observer</em> this weekend from Somalia, where she runs her own foundation lobbying the government to make FGM illegal. Last year she made a short documentary about a 10-year-old girl who bled to death after having her genitals mutilated. It went viral, and suddenly parents started taking daughters they had cut to hospitals, where Ahmed facilitated their medical care. \u201cIn the last year we saved 20 girls from bleeding. And we lost seven.\u201d</p> <p>She is determined to break the silence around FGM in Somalia, and runs community programmes to educate families. \u201cWhen only women are in the room, they all agree FGM is a problem. But if there is even one man there they won\u2019t speak out.\u201d She hopes that by the end of the year, the Somali government will legislate to make it a criminal offence, so that families who practise FGM will face prosecution.</p> <p>Much depends on the outcome of the government\u2019s consultation with influential religious leaders, which is happening at the moment. \u201cMy hope is that before the bill goes to parliament, religious leaders will understand the issue and support the legislation.\u201d</p> <p>She knows how powerful her testimony can be in Somalia at such a time. \u201cI can sit on TV, and talk about it.

I want people to see me empowering other women. I want to show people that whatever Somali women have been through, we can be strong and overcome it.\u201d She hopes that others who have suffered FGM will watch the film and feel less alone. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for women to speak out about FGM. So when two young Somali women came up to me after watching the movie in Edinburgh and hugged me, and said: \u2018Ifra, you are speaking for all of us,\u2019 I felt so happy. I felt so proud.\u201d It took courage for her to open up to the film\u2019s director and scriptwriter, Mary McGuckian. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy, sharing your story with the world. But if it helps women to realise that this cutting is something we should talk about it.\u201d What happened when her grandmother held her down to be cut by her uncle in a small hut is told only in hints: a dirty razor covered in blood, the screams of a young child in intense pain. \u201cIt may be my story, but it is a story of many young women. Those are the people I am fighting for.\u201d She is now an Irish citizen but spoke to the Observer this weekend from Somalia, where she runs her own foundation lobbying the government to make FGM illegal. Last year she made a short documentary about a 10-year-old girl who bled to death after having her genitals mutilated. It went viral, and suddenly parents started taking daughters they had cut to hospitals, where Ahmed facilitated their medical care. \u201cIn the last year we saved 20 girls from bleeding. And we lost seven.\u201d She is determined to break the silence around FGM in Somalia, and runs community programmes to educate families. \u201cWhen only women are in the room, they all agree FGM is a problem. But if there is even one man there they won\u2019t speak out.\u201d She hopes that by the end of the year, the Somali government will legislate to make it a criminal offence, so that families who practise FGM will face prosecution. Much depends on the outcome of the government\u2019s consultation with influential religious leaders, which is happening at the moment. \u201cMy hope is that before the bill goes to parliament, religious leaders will understand the issue and support the legislation.\u201d She knows how powerful her testimony can be in Somalia at such a time. \u201cI can sit on TV, and talk about it. I can debate with the religious leaders and tell them my personal experiences.\u201d She takes heart from the religious scholars who have seen her do this and then called her up to say: \u201cWe are behind you, and we will support you.\u201d But she is aware that not everyone in the country feels that way, and she is risking her life by living there. \u201cThere is killing and bombing and a lot of problems here. I could escape to Ireland, but every day what keeps me going is that I\u2019m making a difference.\u201d She is not daunted by the scale of the problem she faces. The history of FGM in Somalia dates back over 400 years, and the film offers a little insight into the reasons women continue to cut their daughters. In a moving scene towards the end, Ahmed finally gets an opportunity to ask her beloved grandmother \u2013 who raised her from a baby \u2013 why she mutilated so many girls in their family. \u201cThis is our tradition. Our culture,\u201d says the old woman. \u201cThe morning after the wedding night, if the girl was not a virgin, her husband would dig a hole [outside the bride\u2019s family hut] to signal she had not been cut.\u201d These brides were then rejected and sent back to their parents, humiliating their family. FGM is also viewed as a way of protecting daughters from terrible practices of their future husbands. \u201cTo keep her pure when he went away, she would be sewn up, so he would return to find her as if they were on their first night,\u201d Ahmed\u2019s grandmother tells her. \u201cI want this movie to travel the world,\u201d says Ahmed. \u201cI want to reach the decision-makers, the leaders and the young people, who are the future.\u201d She is full of hope. \u201cMy hope is to raise awareness. What happened to me cannot be changed. My past is my past. But what I can do is change the future. \u201cGirls are being traumatised by FGM. Children are dying. I hope people will watch this movie and understand that this has to end.\u201d",

What\u2019s more, sitting in on the psychiatry conference in London, you\u2019d have had no way of knowing this is shoddy science. Instead of speculating about technology effects, we need to <em>test</em> how social media and life satisfaction influence each other and to do so over time. To that end, for our work (published recently in <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/116/21/10226\" title=\"\"><em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em></a>), we focused on a sample of more than 10,000 preteens and teens, analysing nearly a decade of longitudinal data collected from British adolescents.</p> <p>Each year, teens and preteens rated their social media use and told us how satisfied they were with aspects of their life. We were interested in testing both whether changes in social media use over time actually preceded shifts in life satisfaction <em>and</em> whether such changes influenced subsequent social media use. In simple terms, are you more likely to \u201cuse\u201d if you\u2019re happy or sad?</p> <p>What did we find? Well, mostly nothing! In more than half of the thousands of statistical models we tested, we found nothing more than random statistical noise. In the remainder, we did find some small trends over time \u2013 these were mostly clustered in data provided by teenage girls. Decreases in satisfaction with school, family, appearance and friends presaged increased social media use, <em>and</em> increases in social media use preceded decreases in satisfaction with school, family, and friends. You can see then how, if you were determined to extract a story, you could cook up one about teenage girls and unhappiness.</p> <p>But \u2013 and this is key \u2013 it\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that these effects were minuscule by the standards of science and trivial if you want to inform personal parenting decisions. Our results indicated that 99.6% of the variability in adolescent girls\u2019 satisfaction with life had <em>nothing</em> to do with how much they used social media.</p> <p>But instead of seeing these results as disappointing \u2013 as they might be in a journalistic story sense \u2013 in science the lack of an expected finding is inherently valuable, making us reconsider, challenge and update our notion of how social media is affecting us.</p> <p>Where do we go from here? Well, it\u2019s probably best to retire the idea that the amount of time teens spend on social media is a meaningful metric influencing their wellbeing. There <em>are</em> many good reasons to be sceptical of the role of Facebook, Snapchat and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/05/why-tiktok-is-facing-greater-scrutiny-video-sharing-app-child-safety\" title=\"\">TikTok</a> in our society but it would be a mistake to assume science supports fears that every minute online compromises mental health. In fact, this idea risks trivialising and stigmatising those who struggle with mental health on a daily basis.</p> <p>Moving beyond screen time to explain the interplay between technology and the wellbeing of our adolescent population requires us to face some tough questions. It\u2019s all well and good to remember \u201cneurotransmitter deposits\u201d aren\u2019t a thing, and this goldfish nonsense has been repeatedly debunked. But it remains the case that we don\u2019t understand fully the impact of big tech on our society.</p> <p>The fact is that much of the data that would enable scientists to uncover the nuanced and complex effects of technology is locked behind closed doors in Silicon Valley. Until Google, Facebook and the large gaming companies share the data being saved on to their servers with every click, tap or swipe on their products, we will be in the dark about the effects of these products on mental health. Until then, we\u2019ll all be dancing to the steady drumbeat of monetised fear sold by the moral entrepreneurs. </p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Przybylski is Director of Research at the Oxford Internet Institute (OII).</p> <p>Amy Orben is a researcher at the OII and a lecturer in Psychology at The Queen\u2019s College, University of Oxford.</p>",

To that end, for our work (published recently in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences), we focused on a sample of more than 10,000 preteens and teens, analysing nearly a decade of longitudinal data collected from British adolescents. Each year, teens and preteens rated their social media use and told us how satisfied they were with aspects of their life. We were interested in testing both whether changes in social media use over time actually preceded shifts in life satisfaction and whether such changes influenced subsequent social media use. In simple terms, are you more likely to \u201cuse\u201d if you\u2019re happy or sad? What did we find? Well, mostly nothing! In more than half of the thousands of statistical models we tested, we found nothing more than random statistical noise. In the remainder, we did find some small trends over time \u2013 these were mostly clustered in data provided by teenage girls. Decreases in satisfaction with school, family, appearance and friends presaged increased social media use, and increases in social media use preceded decreases in satisfaction with school, family, and friends. You can see then how, if you were determined to extract a story, you could cook up one about teenage girls and unhappiness. But \u2013 and this is key \u2013 it\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that these effects were minuscule by the standards of science and trivial if you want to inform personal parenting decisions. Our results indicated that 99.6% of the variability in adolescent girls\u2019 satisfaction with life had nothing to do with how much they used social media. But instead of seeing these results as disappointing \u2013 as they might be in a journalistic story sense \u2013 in science the lack of an expected finding is inherently valuable, making us reconsider, challenge and update our notion of how social media is affecting us. Where do we go from here? Well, it\u2019s probably best to retire the idea that the amount of time teens spend on social media is a meaningful metric influencing their wellbeing. There are many good reasons to be sceptical of the role of Facebook, Snapchat and TikTok in our society but it would be a mistake to assume science supports fears that every minute online compromises mental health. In fact, this idea risks trivialising and stigmatising those who struggle with mental health on a daily basis. Moving beyond screen time to explain the interplay between technology and the wellbeing of our adolescent population requires us to face some tough questions. It\u2019s all well and good to remember \u201cneurotransmitter deposits\u201d aren\u2019t a thing, and this goldfish nonsense has been repeatedly debunked. But it remains the case that we don\u2019t understand fully the impact of big tech on our society. The fact is that much of the data that would enable scientists to uncover the nuanced and complex effects of technology is locked behind closed doors in Silicon Valley. Until Google, Facebook and the large gaming companies share the data being saved on to their servers with every click, tap or swipe on their products, we will be in the dark about the effects of these products on mental health. Until then, we\u2019ll all be dancing to the steady drumbeat of monetised fear sold by the moral entrepreneurs. \u2022 Andrew Przybylski is Director of Research at the Oxford Internet Institute (OII).

      "body": "<p>In a transfixing picture by the Swiss artist F\u00e9lix Vallotton (1865-1925), a woman in a long red dress is tightly entwined with a black-clad man on a sofa. She rests her head on his shoulder, mouth to his ear. He clasps her waist, leaning into her whispers. All seems set for a fine romance.</p> <p>But she is very nearly slipping off his knee, and it is impossible to know if she\u2019s murmuring, since most of her face is in shadow; just as it is impossible to know if he is listening \u2013 or scheming. His eyes are closed in rapture, as it seems, but his brows are tellingly arched and his mouth appears suspiciously smug. The painting is called <em>The Lie</em>.</p> <p>So who is lying, and what is the lie? That she loves him for himself, not his money; that he loves her too, that he really will marry her one day? That there is nobody else? The composition is divided \u2013 on one side the couple, on the other a pressure of insinuating scarlet decor \u2013 just as the picture divides its audience. Is it the man or the woman (or both) telling the lies?</p> <p>Vallotton is a strange case in his own right; very famous in his native Switzerland, hardly shown here. The last British exhibition was in 1976. His works are scattered all over Europe, too often in private collections. One of the largest and most startling paintings <a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/felix-vallotton\" title=\"\">at the Royal Academy</a> is of the Bon March\u00e9 department store in Paris, famous from Zola\u2019s novel <em>The Ladies\u2019 Delight</em>, teeming with shoppers and brilliantly coloured goods \u2013 parasols, bottles, ribbons, pyramids of candy \u2013 all glowing in the gaslight. It is normally hidden in a Swiss bank.</p> <p>Born to a strict Protestant family in Lausanne, Vallotton escaped to study art in Paris at the age of 16. The city remains a perpetual curiosity. There are weird vignettes \u2013 a painting of a veiled woman whose poodle leaps into the most alien shape on the boulevard; a milling scrum of fashionable Parisians staring hard at something which their obsession obscures from our sight. Small children very often trying to get away from their parents.</p> <p>Vallotton notices the advent of the public telephone, the starkness of the new electric lighting, the brawl in the cafe where the white-clothed table is about to crash to the floor in a maelstrom of alcohol and rage. He notices his own watchful eye.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"babfe8fd24ea26e70106ef237070755bfceb1a9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/babfe8fd24ea26e70106ef237070755bfceb1a9b/0_0_6152_7720/797.jpg\" alt=\"F\u00e9lix Vallotton\u2019s Self-portrait at the Age of Twenty, 1885. \" width=\"797\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">F\u00e9lix Vallotton\u2019s Self-portrait at the Age of Twenty, 1885.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Mus\u00e9e cantonal des Beaux-Arts de Lausanne</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is the subject of <em>Self-portrait at the Age of Twenty</em>, with which this show opens. So precise it\u2019s more like limning, in the Holbein tradition, this unnerving image shows the young Vallotton against the chill blue-green background of northern art. To see is to know: and how well he seems to know himself already \u2013 the disquieting boy against the quiet backdrop, turning to us with his sidelong eye.</p> <p>And Vallotton\u2019s vision is uniquely strange. His paintings are generally compact and small, with sultry hues and the seductive brushwork of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Nabis\" title=\"\">Nabis</a> (he was a lifelong friend of Vuillard). But there is almost invariably a narrative puzzle at their heart. Why does the invalid on the left of <em>La Malade</em> face away from us in her bed, which is turned towards the wall, while the maid on the right enters the room like a confident starlet? Two women at odds, as if in quite separate worlds?</p> <p>What is really going on in <em>The Visit</em>, an alarming scenario in which another couple \u2013 she in coat and feather hat, he gripping her tight by the hand \u2013 stand at the threshold of a room in which the very furniture seems to be conspiring with a possible assault. A door opens on to a lamplit bedroom, waiting like a trap. Unless of course this gentleman is paying?</p> <p>And aren\u2019t the biblical tables turned in <em>Chaste Su</em><em>zann</em><em>e</em>, in which a knowing young woman entertains two elderly men, light glinting viciously off their bald heads, in the depths of a plush banquette? Relationships are always ambiguous. Even the lone man by a window, brown suit mingling with the brown of the curtains, seems to be hiding as he watches the street below.</p> <p>In the woodcuts with which he found fame, Vallotton himself often looks down on Paris from roughly the same vantage point. The streets are running wild. Crowds protest, surging away from some unseen threat, coats flailing, top hats scattered. Rain pours down on a rival flood of umbrellas. Brutal police with comedy moustaches descend like the Keystone Cops. But behind them are the bodies of people who are dying or already dead. This print is neither quite realism nor outright satire.</p> <p>Vallotton\u2019s prints are astonishing in their sheer graphic force and register. His pure blacks burn fierce against the pristine white page, giving off a coruscating afterimage. He can make the white panel of a window somehow indicate darkest night, and turn diagonal black lines into a vision of thin air. It is no surprise that his Parisian scenes are reproduced in newspapers to this day. In <em>L\u2019Assassinat</em>, murder takes place in a bedroom so perfectly conveyed in a few simplified objects it could be an early <em>New Yorker</em> cartoon.</p> <p>Yet Vallotton is a hard artist to bring into focus. This is not just because he worked in so many different genres \u2013 landscape, portrait, striking still lifes, like the painting of five gleaming peppers lying next to a knife, which seems stained with their redness, or is it with blood? There is the abiding question of his tone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a03be5c596013eeec4cf5cc4becbc8fb4136df3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a03be5c596013eeec4cf5cc4becbc8fb4136df3/0_21_4899_3817/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Felix Vallotton: The White and the Black, 1913.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"779\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Pungent humour\u2019: Vallotton\u2019s take on Manet\u2019s Olympia, The White and the Black, 1913.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Kunstmuseum Bern; Hahnloser/Jaeggli Foundation, Villa Flora, Winterthur</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is difficult to associate the pungent humour of his large reprise of Manet\u2019s <em>Olympia </em>\u2013 in which the black maid at the back now appears front of stage (Vallotton\u2019s blocking is superb) smoking a sardonic cigarette \u2013 with the haunting beauty of his empty landscapes.</p> <p>And it is nearly impossible to believe that the same artist could have produced the long sequence of shadowy interiors that look forward to Alfred Hitchcock and Edward Hopper, as well as the even longer series of terrible female nudes, lumpen, cold and crude.</p> <p>But at his best, Vallotton\u2019s scenes are almost proverbial in their miniature narratives.

      "body": "<p>Sitting talking to Sally Lane and John Letts at their dining table in their terraced house in Oxford, a series of questions nag in my head. One is: \u201cWhat might be the limits to parental love?\u201d As husband and wife piece together once again the story of how their eldest son, Jack, then 18, took himself off to Jordan on holiday five years ago and ended up in the newly formed Islamic State in Iraq and Syria \u2013 a journey that eventually landed him in a Kurdish prison camp and put them through a hellish court ordeal \u2013 it is hard not to wonder just a little about that word \u201cunconditional\u201d.</p> <p>Their recent court case at the Old Bailey, three and a half years after their initial arrests, itself seemed designed to test that idea to breaking point. Letts, 58, an organic farmer, and Lane, 57, who had worked in publishing and for the NHS, were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/21/jack-letts-isis-suspect-parents-found-guilty-of-funding-terrorism-oxford-syria\" title=\"\">convicted on one charge of \u201cfunding terrorism\u201d</a>, and acquitted of another. A third charge was left on file after the jury failed to reach a verdict. Their crime had been to send, at the request of their son, the sum of \u00a3223 to an intermediary in Lebanon in September 2015, in part to pay for a pair of glasses. There was no suggestion that they believed they were sending the money to Isis, the court accepted, but it found them guilty of knowing there was a risk that the cash might fall into the wrong hands.</p> <p>They were found not guilty of trying and failing to wire a further payment of \u00a31,000 later that year. That was needed, they believed, for Jack to pay a people-smuggler to help him escape the \u201ccaliphate\u201d after he had denounced Isis as \u201cun-Islamic\u201d and had apparently been on the run in fear of his life.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s nice that we are not in prison, I suppose. Though at least if you are in prison, you know there is nothing you can do</p> <footer> <cite>John Letts</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Letts and Lane were sentenced to 15 months in prison, suspended for a year. The investigation and legal case cost an estimated \u00a37m. The verdict and sentence were, in Lane\u2019s view, engineered so \u201ceveryone went home happy. All that money did not appear to have been wasted. We didn\u2019t go to prison. The prosecutor was beaming at the verdict, because she had made her point. And the jury, who by then appeared bored silly by the whole thing, could finally go home.\u201d</p> <p>When I sat down with them a week after this verdict, last Sunday afternoon, I began to ask if they were relieved the trial was over, but their tense and exhausted faces made it clear such a question was beside the point. One long legal case has simply given way to another: the battle to get their son, now 23, home to face justice here \u2013 or in Letts\u2019s native Canada \u2013 from the north Syrian prison camp where he has been held for more than two years without trial. \u201cThere is no less stress now,\u201d Letts says. \u201cIt\u2019s nice that we are not in prison, I suppose. Though at least if you are in prison, you know there is nothing you can do.\u201d Instead, their waking hours are consumed with framing arguments to governments who have no wish to hear them.</p> <p>I first met Lane and Letts back in January. I had come across a Twitter account that Lane had set up in which she mentioned how the local jobcentre had advised her to move cities if she wanted to find work. I\u2019d contacted her in the first instance to sympathise with that situation and to see if she might want to talk about it. Over a lunch of home-made soup and bread she and her husband went through the nightmare of the previous years, in which they had not only lived in constant fear for their son, but had also lost their livelihoods and something close to their sanity. A contempt-of-court restriction had left them unable to speak in public about any aspect of their situation or Jack\u2019s.</p> <p>After lunch that day John Letts, who has a contrarian\u2019s intellectual energy, took me on a drive to introduce me to his former life. He had worked for a time as a roof thatcher when he first came to Britain in the 1980s, and had subsequently <a href=\"https://www.bakerybits.co.uk/john-letts\" title=\"\">revolutionised the idea of \u201cheritage grain\u201d</a> with 15 years of research into ancient strains of wheat and rye, culled from old thatch, to redevelop lost varieties with unique sustainable qualities. Prince Charles was a fan, and grew his crops at Highgrove; to celebrate the partnership Letts had given the prince a scythe as a present, with a Canadian maple handle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4f4dd01bdf755631165893e2618988012100f443\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f4dd01bdf755631165893e2618988012100f443/0_146_1296_1697/764.jpg\" alt=\"The photograph of Jack Letts in Raqqa that accompanied the first news stories about him.\" width=\"764\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The photograph of Jack Letts in Syria that accompanied the first news stories about him.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Counter Terrorism Policing South East/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At about the time Jack went to the Middle East Letts had finally got the business to the point where it was gaining national and international recognition. Because of restrictions placed on his and Lane\u2019s time and finances since their arrest, however, he feared his research would be lost and passed his work on to others. He took me to a few places where his knowledge still thrived: first to Hamblin\u2019s bakery in Oxford, which used his magical wheat in its fabulous bread, and then to Toad, an artisan distillery that was using the ancient rye grains he had developed to make unique gins and vodkas.</p> <p>While we drove Letts had elaborated on the ways in which he had lost his son. He stressed some of the difficulties Jack had faced, mental health issues that saw him drop out of the sixth form of Cherwell school nearby, and the problems of getting help for him. Jack had been diagnosed with an obsessive-compulsive disorder and with Tourette syndrome. Letts painted a picture of a troubled but highly sociable teenager, a boy who had sailed through his GCSEs, who had previously been identified as gifted in English and maths; a son with whom he loved to argue the toss about religion and politics and everything else.</p> <p>When Lane and Letts appeared in court a very different narrative was told about Jack. The prosecution focused on the messages that had been uncovered from online accounts in his name. The most infamous of them included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/may/23/isis-suspect-told-parents-he-wanted-to-behead-schoolfriend-court-hears\" title=\"\">a savage death threat</a>, a wish to perform \u201ca martyrdom operation\u201d against an old school acquaintance who had joined the British army. Sally Lane had confronted her son about that post and threatened to disown him, but now both parents maintained that his accounts had been hijacked by Isis sympathisers. Lane was cross-examined for three days on every exchange she\u2019d had with her son. Letts did not give evidence on advice from their lawyers. Instead the prosecution went line-by-line through his emails to Jack. \u201cA father should never live to see his son buried,\u201d Letts pleaded to him in September 2014. Another message read: \u201cJack, I\u2019ve never begged you before but I am now. Please contact us. Your mother is collapsing with fear and sadness \u2026 You don\u2019t have to die to help your fellow Muslims.\u201d</p> <p>The five long years of worry have taken their toll on them as a couple. They are so familiar with the complex nuances of the case that it has become a kind of tetchy shorthand between them. When I arrived at their home last week I was not out of the hall before they were in a clipped argument about what documents they could send me to shed light on Jack\u2019s current situation. At the heart of all this remains their attempt to square the child they raised \u2013 the child present in golden, smiley photographs of family holidays \u2013 with the figure conjured by the prosecution in court. They trace this disjunction back to the <em><a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/jihadi-jack-first-white-british-boy-to-join-isis-77tgnll70sd\" title=\"\">Sunday Times</a></em><a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/jihadi-jack-first-white-british-boy-to-join-isis-77tgnll70sd\" title=\"\"> article of January 201</a><a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/jihadi-jack-first-white-british-boy-to-join-isis-77tgnll70sd\" title=\"\">6</a>, which coined the name \u201cJihadi Jack\u201d for their son alongside a now familiar picture of him in combat trousers in Raqqa. The story gave Isis a white and middle-class face for the first time \u2013 stoking a fear in every parent with a child on a gap year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c50e3a3a6ef6655b389e1700174e31089f626415\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c50e3a3a6ef6655b389e1700174e31089f626415/0_127_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Letts and Sally Lane outside the Old Bailey in London after their conviction last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Letts and Sally Lane outside the Old Bailey in London after their conviction last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yui Mok/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the public mind it is that image of \u201cJihadi Jack\u201d that has taken hold. I have listened to enough radio phone-ins and followed enough social media to know that the loudest public voices agree with the TV verdict of Piers Morgan on the case, that he didn\u2019t care if Jack Letts was left to rot in a Kurdish jail for ever: \u201cIf you go to fight in Syria, that\u2019s the way the cookie crumbles.\u201d</p> <p>That is not what Letts and Lane can allow themselves to think. They point to the fact that 400 of the 900 British nationals who went to Syria to support Isis have now been repatriated. (The home secretary, Sajid Javid, gave a statement <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2019-02-18/debates/69E286BB-03A2-4467-AB65-B3059436CD53/UKNationalsReturningFromSyria\" title=\"\">confirming that number in </a><a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2019-02-18/debates/69E286BB-03A2-4467-AB65-B3059436CD53/UKNationalsReturningFromSyria\" title=\"\">February</a><a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2019-02-18/debates/69E286BB-03A2-4467-AB65-B3059436CD53/UKNationalsReturningFromSyria\" title=\"\">, in a</a><a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2019-02-18/debates/69E286BB-03A2-4467-AB65-B3059436CD53/UKNationalsReturningFromSyria\" title=\"\"> Commons exchange</a> in which it emerged that \u201conly about 40\u201d of those 400 had or would face trial.) You can see how, as this quiet \u201cpolicy\u201d has been enacted, it might have been useful politics to keep one or two vivid individuals still in Syria in the public eye. Shamima Begum, the Bethnal Green teenager, was the first. Since she has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/20/shamima-begum-family-challenge-sajid-javid-over-citizenship-decision\" title=\"\">stripped of her British nationality</a> and after her child died in a refugee camp, the spotlight has shifted to Jack Letts.</p> <p>Jack\u2019s case for repatriation has not been advanced in recent months by the attention surrounding his parents\u2019 trial. A <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-48624104\" title=\"\">series of TV interviews with him from prison</a> included his admission to the BBC that he had been \u201can enemy of Britain\u201d and once would have been prepared to carry out a suicide bombing \u2013 though he expressed what looked like heartfelt regret for those positions now.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have always said that if we find something he has done wrong, I will be the first to condemn it.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His parents offer two determined arguments in his defence. The first is their belief that when he gave those interviews he was under duress from his jailers. They have little detail of the conditions in which Jack has been held, beyond an early report he gave to the Canadian authorities in which he said he was in a cell of 30 men and only eight beds, and they were allowed out for 20 minutes a day. He maintains that he has been tortured in custody.</p> <p>That view is supported by the civil rights advocate Clive Stafford Smith, the founder of Reprieve, who met Jack in prison. He spoke to him a couple of weeks after the BBC report and said that Jack wished to make clear the circumstances of that interview: \u201cHe had been taken to a place proximate to where he had been tortured, had been asked many of the same questions that he has been asked under torture, and he had been bound to give the same false answers because the people in charge of his torture were there.\u201d The BBC contends that Jack Letts gave full consent to the interview and thus all protocols were followed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b7eaca0ec49def988ccbd2276b57c78449a9268\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b7eaca0ec49def988ccbd2276b57c78449a9268/0_64_1536_1920/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jack on his father\u2019s farm near Oxford in 2006.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack on his father\u2019s farm near Oxford in 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Sally Lane &amp; John Letts/Courtesy of John Letts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jack\u2019s parents\u2019 second argument in mitigation is that their son went to Iraq for humanitarian reasons; however sympathetic he might have been originally to the idea of the \u201ccaliphate\u201d, he was a gentle soul, never a fighter. \u201cHe was a white Englishman, surely Isis would have used him in recruitment videos and so on if he was involved\u2026\u201d Lane says. \u201cOr there would be pictures of him posing with guns.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe was always talking about learning Arabic so he could help in a hospital or teach,\u201d John Letts says. \u201cHe was inspired by the Arab spring and horrified by the war in Syria and the 6 million refugees.\u201d John clings to a <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2019-02-22/jihadi-jack-interview-jack-letts-itv-news-syria/\" title=\"\">last exchange of </a><a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2019-02-22/jihadi-jack-interview-jack-letts-itv-news-syria/\" title=\"\">an ITV interview</a> where his son said of his prison, \u201cIf I have to stay here longer so you can get the women and children out first, that\u2019s OK\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI was really proud of him saying that,\u201d Letts says. \u201cOf course people will read that and say: \u2018You are proud of Jihadi Jack \u2013 you have to be insane!\u2019 But I\u2019m sorry, from my perspective he is still a decent kid. I have always said that if we find something he has done wrong, I will be the first to condemn it. Until then, am I supposed to just believe what the <em>Daily Mail</em> says about my son?\u201d</p> <p>Lane subsequently sends me the printouts of messaging exchanges they had with Jack while he claimed to be in hiding from Isis in Raqqa between March 2016 and July 2017. Initially he was trying to organise for them to send money so he could escape. Some of the exchanges between mother and son capture the cadences of family banter; others take in the surreal contrasts between Oxford and Raqqa, food shopping and Russian air strikes. Often Jack responds to questions about his safety, about his lack of money, with a belief that Allah will provide. In order to be sure it was Jack talking, Lane occasionally asked him little bits about his past. In one of the last messages, after the fall of Raqqa, there is the following exchange:</p> <p>Sally: I\u2019ve been so worried. OK, I\u2019ll test you. What was the name of the head of discipline at your school who gave u C3s? Are u OK?</p> <p>Jack: I\u2019m fine, Mr Davis?</p> <p>Sally: Yes</p> <p>Jack: So many people used to give me c3s. What\u2019s new? I\u2019m out by the way.</p> <p>Sally: We\u2019ve been worried sick. Out of the country?????</p> <p>Jack: Out of what they call Isis territories.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ba5cd240a1311f2eea0c252df6f2486ca6088c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ba5cd240a1311f2eea0c252df6f2486ca6088c7/120_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jack Letts is interviewed on ITV Newsin frebruary 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Letts is interviewed on ITV News in February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In them, too, in between doctrinal religious quotation, you get a little sense of Jack\u2019s quick wit \u2013 if things had taken just a slightly different turn, Sally tells me at one point, she\u2019d imagined Jack would have not been in a war in Syria but on the stage at the Edinburgh fringe with his friends.</p> <p>One of the unspoken subtexts of the court case was the way Jack\u2019s conversion to Islam, when he was 16, seemed to exacerbate his OCD. Did they recognise that link?</p> <p>\u201cHe had cognitive behavioural therapy for the OCD when he was younger,\u201d Lane says, \u201cand that seemed to work. But it came back again after he converted. One doctor actually told us that the religion was a useful vehicle for his OCD. With all the praying and washing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome Muslims Jack knew had told him that [the OCD] was the evil spirits of the djinn that had been sent to test him \u2013 a load of crap \u2013 and that the solution was to wash more, pray more,\u201d John says. \u201cHe was getting up at two o\u2019clock in the morning and praying, and washing, so he never slept more than a couple of hours. He started to fall asleep in class \u2013 A-levels became impossible.\u201d</p> <p>Alongside those habits they concede that Jack developed an obsessive \u201csearch for the truth\u201d. He read everything he could find about Islam and about what a perfect Muslim was. \u201cHe had this massive grammar book of Arabic that he would carry everywhere with him,\u201d Lane says. \u201cHe took it to America on holiday with him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll OCD is about fear, if you don\u2019t go through the rituals then something bad will happen,\u201d Letts says. \u201cIn Islam that becomes, if you don\u2019t [live according to the religion] you are going to burn in hell. He was obsessed with not doing something wrong. That is why he wanted to learn Arabic so he could be the best Muslim he could be.\u201d</p> <p>It is also, it appears, one reason why he ended up in Islamic State, to test those abstract notions against reality. His parents want to believe he was quite quickly disillusioned. They admit that they do not know what Jack was doing in Syria for several months. But when he reconnected with them in early 2016 he was, according to their reading of his often cryptic messages, holed up in friends\u2019 houses in Raqqa, dodging Russian bombardment, nursing a shrapnel wound.</p> <p>Their faith in him still being who he was is what sustains them, really. Is it possible for them, I ask, to entertain the idea that he had been brainwashed, targeted by people who might seek to radicalise him?</p> <p>\u201cWhat you are saying is: are we in denial about him?\u201d Letts says. \u201cThat is what everyone is throwing at us\u2026\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e36bc9ab4286b90fc3d8ef2a55376acb0705d20d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e36bc9ab4286b90fc3d8ef2a55376acb0705d20d/0_353_2576_1546/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Letts family on holiday in Snowdonia, with Jack, aged 12, on the right, and his younger brother Tyler on the left.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Letts family on holiday in Snowdonia, with Jack, aged 12, on the right, and his younger brother Tyler on the left.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Sally Lane &amp; John Letts/Courtesy of John Letts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I say I can only imagine the difficulty of wrestling with the idea of the boy they loved so much and this different man who is being presented. In January 2015, Jack got married to the daughter of an Iraqi tribal leader and they subsequently had a baby. Was that in character for the boy they knew?</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t surprised he got married,\u201d Letts says. \u201cThough I was disappointed not to have been at his wedding. He shows me a message in Arabic Jack tried to send to his wife through the Red Cross, a love letter: \u2018I tried to get to you and little Mo in Mosul three times and I couldn\u2019t get through \u2013 Isis were going to kill me. I will never stop trying to find you even if it takes 40 years.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Lane says she thinks of the apparent ease of Jack\u2019s integration into Sunni Iraqi society in terms of a family holiday they had in Morocco when he was 17. \u201cJack just had dinner with a different set of people each night. He\u2019d get talking to people and they would invite him back to their house. That is the way he was.\u201d</p> <p>The prosecution took close account of one email that John sent to a friend, soon after they first heard the devastating news that Jack was in Syria. \u201cI\u2019ve lost him,\u201d Letts wrote. \u201cI feel terrified, betrayed by Jack, embarrassed, massively let down. I know he\u2019s not a nasty boy. But he\u2019s very stupid and I created him, with my armchair revolutionary shite.\u201d</p> <p>What did he mean by that?</p> <p>\u201cI was in shock and fearing the worst,\u201d Letts says, \u201cand feeling guilty that I had raised him to support the underdog.\u201d He points to the fact that in the past he had been involved in campaigning about East Timor, for example, to the extent that they had Timorese activists living in the spare room. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call myself a radical lefty as some people are doing. But certainly Jack was raised to question oppression and imperialism. We took him on the Iraq war march and all this kind of stuff. And at that moment [when I first heard he was in Syria] I was thinking, \u2018Am I reaping what I sowed?\u2019 That\u2019s all.\u201d</p> <p>If they are guilty of anything, it seems to me, it is of a style of parenting determined to respect above all the individuality of their teenage son, his right to be intellectually curious, to pursue \u201cgrand adventures\u201d. Hindsight is a wonderful thing, but is that something they recognise?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d49271dc2106b94c842a2449eb15f5533b95bcd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d49271dc2106b94c842a2449eb15f5533b95bcd/0_36_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Letts and Sally Lane demonstrate outside St Paul\u2019s, October 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Letts and Sally Lane demonstrate outside St Paul\u2019s, October 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philip Toscano/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have two regrets,\u201d Letts says. \u201cOne is that when he converted to Islam I didn\u2019t walk with him on that path, by being more attentive to what he was doing. But, you know, my business was going under and I was trying to farm and for a time I maybe didn\u2019t give him the time I should have. He saw me probably as this atheist dad who had arguments with him and I maybe should have backed up and said, you know, just \u2018that\u2019s interesting, son\u2019. And the second is that I think now his OCD was worse than we ever addressed. It was hard to get help for him when he was a child, and once he had become an adult there was little we could do. Those are my two regrets. But I honestly can\u2019t say I was worried when he left\u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have to remember,\u201d Lane says, \u201che was going to Jordan with his mates\u2026\u201d</p> <p>While the legal battles have been front and centre, Lane and Letts\u2019s lives have fractured in other ways. A few good friends have stood by them but inevitable strains show between them as a couple. Their younger son, Tyler, 21, has been away at university for much of the ordeal, though his AS-level revision was thrown off course when the police seized a computer containing all his notes. The time consumed by the legal battle has left Letts and Lane in \u201ca deep financial hole\u201d. After Letts shared the painstaking results of his research, the movement he pioneered in heritage grains has picked up momentum without him. Lane has had to move from job to job, having been asked to leave several when colleagues discovered she was a \u201cterrorist suspect\u201d. On the morning that their trial began, they received a bailiff\u2019s letter to say their remaining possessions would be taken away.</p> <p>It seems a bit hopeless to ask them about hope, but I wonder if they can, with the trial over, think of getting their lives back on track?</p> <p>\u201cNot until Jack is safe,\u201d Lane says. \u201cI hope that is not long. There was an Italian handed over to the Italian government last week\u2026\u201d As a mother she says there\u2019s nothing she can enjoy until then; the baking summer afternoon outside is just a reminder of the heat in her son\u2019s prison.</p> <p>\u201cJack has become the most politicised figure of any of the detainees,\u201d Letts says. \u201cObviously [the authorities] would probably most like him to \u2018fall down the stairs\u2019. But we are not going to go away. I am hoping if we raise enough pressure, he becomes such a pain in the ass for everyone that they will hand him over too.\u201d</p> <p>They are, despite everything, Letts suggests, placing their faith in British \u2013 or Canadian \u2013 values: \u201cThe rule of law, innocent until proven guilty, the rights of the individual\u2026\u201d That, and their stubborn love for their son.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sitting talking to Sally Lane and John Letts at their dining table in their terraced house in Oxford, a series of questions nag in my head. One is: \u201cWhat might be the limits to parental love?\u201d As husband and wife piece together once again the story of how their eldest son, Jack, then 18, took himself off to Jordan on holiday five years ago and ended up in the newly formed Islamic State in Iraq and Syria \u2013 a journey that eventually landed him in a Kurdish prison camp and put them through a hellish court ordeal \u2013 it is hard not to wonder just a little about that word \u201cunconditional\u201d. Their recent court case at the Old Bailey, three and a half years after their initial arrests, itself seemed designed to test that idea to breaking point. Letts, 58, an organic farmer, and Lane, 57, who had worked in publishing and for the NHS, were convicted on one charge of \u201cfunding terrorism\u201d, and acquitted of another. A third charge was left on file after the jury failed to reach a verdict. Their crime had been to send, at the request of their son, the sum of \u00a3223 to an intermediary in Lebanon in September 2015, in part to pay for a pair of glasses. There was no suggestion that they believed they were sending the money to Isis, the court accepted, but it found them guilty of knowing there was a risk that the cash might fall into the wrong hands. They were found not guilty of trying and failing to wire a further payment of \u00a31,000 later that year. That was needed, they believed, for Jack to pay a people-smuggler to help him escape the \u201ccaliphate\u201d after he had denounced Isis as \u201cun-Islamic\u201d and had apparently been on the run in fear of his life. Letts and Lane were sentenced to 15 months in prison, suspended for a year. The investigation and legal case cost an estimated \u00a37m. The verdict and sentence were, in Lane\u2019s view, engineered so \u201ceveryone went home happy. All that money did not appear to have been wasted. We didn\u2019t go to prison. The prosecutor was beaming at the verdict, because she had made her point. And the jury, who by then appeared bored silly by the whole thing, could finally go home.\u201d When I sat down with them a week after this verdict, last Sunday afternoon, I began to ask if they were relieved the trial was over, but their tense and exhausted faces made it clear such a question was beside the point. One long legal case has simply given way to another: the battle to get their son, now 23, home to face justice here \u2013 or in Letts\u2019s native Canada \u2013 from the north Syrian prison camp where he has been held for more than two years without trial. \u201cThere is no less stress now,\u201d Letts says. \u201cIt\u2019s nice that we are not in prison, I suppose. Though at least if you are in prison, you know there is nothing you can do.\u201d Instead, their waking hours are consumed with framing arguments to governments who have no wish to hear them. I first met Lane and Letts back in January. I had come across a Twitter account that Lane had set up in which she mentioned how the local jobcentre had advised her to move cities if she wanted to find work. I\u2019d contacted her in the first instance to sympathise with that situation and to see if she might want to talk about it. Over a lunch of home-made soup and bread she and her husband went through the nightmare of the previous years, in which they had not only lived in constant fear for their son, but had also lost their livelihoods and something close to their sanity. A contempt-of-court restriction had left them unable to speak in public about any aspect of their situation or Jack\u2019s. After lunch that day John Letts, who has a contrarian\u2019s intellectual energy, took me on a drive to introduce me to his former life. He had worked for a time as a roof thatcher when he first came to Britain in the 1980s, and had subsequently revolutionised the idea of \u201cheritage grain\u201d with 15 years of research into ancient strains of wheat and rye, culled from old thatch, to redevelop lost varieties with unique sustainable qualities. Prince Charles was a fan, and grew his crops at Highgrove; to celebrate the partnership Letts had given the prince a scythe as a present, with a Canadian maple handle. At about the time Jack went to the Middle East Letts had finally got the business to the point where it was gaining national and international recognition. Because of restrictions placed on his and Lane\u2019s time and finances since their arrest, however, he feared his research would be lost and passed his work on to others. He took me to a few places where his knowledge still thrived: first to Hamblin\u2019s bakery in Oxford, which used his magical wheat in its fabulous bread, and then to Toad, an artisan distillery that was using the ancient rye grains he had developed to make unique gins and vodkas. While we drove Letts had elaborated on the ways in which he had lost his son. He stressed some of the difficulties Jack had faced, mental health issues that saw him drop out of the sixth form of Cherwell school nearby, and the problems of getting help for him. Jack had been diagnosed with an obsessive-compulsive disorder and with Tourette syndrome. Letts painted a picture of a troubled but highly sociable teenager, a boy who had sailed through his GCSEs, who had previously been identified as gifted in English and maths; a son with whom he loved to argue the toss about religion and politics and everything else. When Lane and Letts appeared in court a very different narrative was told about Jack. The prosecution focused on the messages that had been uncovered from online accounts in his name. The most infamous of them included a savage death threat, a wish to perform \u201ca martyrdom operation\u201d against an old school acquaintance who had joined the British army. Sally Lane had confronted her son about that post and threatened to disown him, but now both parents maintained that his accounts had been hijacked by Isis sympathisers. Lane was cross-examined for three days on every exchange she\u2019d had with her son. Letts did not give evidence on advice from their lawyers. Instead the prosecution went line-by-line through his emails to Jack. \u201cA father should never live to see his son buried,\u201d Letts pleaded to him in September 2014. Another message read: \u201cJack, I\u2019ve never begged you before but I am now. Please contact us. Your mother is collapsing with fear and sadness \u2026 You don\u2019t have to die to help your fellow Muslims.\u201d The five long years of worry have taken their toll on them as a couple. They are so familiar with the complex nuances of the case that it has become a kind of tetchy shorthand between them. When I arrived at their home last week I was not out of the hall before they were in a clipped argument about what documents they could send me to shed light on Jack\u2019s current situation. At the heart of all this remains their attempt to square the child they raised \u2013 the child present in golden, smiley photographs of family holidays \u2013 with the figure conjured by the prosecution in court. They trace this disjunction back to the Sunday Times article of January 2016, which coined the name \u201cJihadi Jack\u201d for their son alongside a now familiar picture of him in combat trousers in Raqqa. The story gave Isis a white and middle-class face for the first time \u2013 stoking a fear in every parent with a child on a gap year. In the public mind it is that image of \u201cJihadi Jack\u201d that has taken hold. I have listened to enough radio phone-ins and followed enough social media to know that the loudest public voices agree with the TV verdict of Piers Morgan on the case, that he didn\u2019t care if Jack Letts was left to rot in a Kurdish jail for ever: \u201cIf you go to fight in Syria, that\u2019s the way the cookie crumbles.\u201d That is not what Letts and Lane can allow themselves to think. They point to the fact that 400 of the 900 British nationals who went to Syria to support Isis have now been repatriated. (The home secretary, Sajid Javid, gave a statement confirming that number in February, in a Commons exchange in which it emerged that \u201conly about 40\u201d of those 400 had or would face trial.) You can see how, as this quiet \u201cpolicy\u201d has been enacted, it might have been useful politics to keep one or two vivid individuals still in Syria in the public eye. Shamima Begum, the Bethnal Green teenager, was the first. Since she has been stripped of her British nationality and after her child died in a refugee camp, the spotlight has shifted to Jack Letts. Jack\u2019s case for repatriation has not been advanced in recent months by the attention surrounding his parents\u2019 trial. A series of TV interviews with him from prison included his admission to the BBC that he had been \u201can enemy of Britain\u201d and once would have been prepared to carry out a suicide bombing \u2013 though he expressed what looked like heartfelt regret for those positions now. His parents offer two determined arguments in his defence. The first is their belief that when he gave those interviews he was under duress from his jailers. They have little detail of the conditions in which Jack has been held, beyond an early report he gave to the Canadian authorities in which he said he was in a cell of 30 men and only eight beds, and they were allowed out for 20 minutes a day. He maintains that he has been tortured in custody. That view is supported by the civil rights advocate Clive Stafford Smith, the founder of Reprieve, who met Jack in prison. He spoke to him a couple of weeks after the BBC report and said that Jack wished to make clear the circumstances of that interview: \u201cHe had been taken to a place proximate to where he had been tortured, had been asked many of the same questions that he has been asked under torture, and he had been bound to give the same false answers because the people in charge of his torture were there.\u201d The BBC contends that Jack Letts gave full consent to the interview and thus all protocols were followed. Jack\u2019s parents\u2019 second argument in mitigation is that their son went to Iraq for humanitarian reasons; however sympathetic he might have been originally to the idea of the \u201ccaliphate\u201d, he was a gentle soul, never a fighter. \u201cHe was a white Englishman, surely Isis would have used him in recruitment videos and so on if he was involved\u2026\u201d Lane says. \u201cOr there would be pictures of him posing with guns.\u201d \u201cHe was always talking about learning Arabic so he could help in a hospital or teach,\u201d John Letts says. \u201cHe was inspired by the Arab spring and horrified by the war in Syria and the 6 million refugees.\u201d John clings to a last exchange of an ITV interview where his son said of his prison, \u201cIf I have to stay here longer so you can get the women and children out first, that\u2019s OK\u201d. \u201cI was really proud of him saying that,\u201d Letts says. \u201cOf course people will read that and say: \u2018You are proud of Jihadi Jack \u2013 you have to be insane!\u2019 But I\u2019m sorry, from my perspective he is still a decent kid. I have always said that if we find something he has done wrong, I will be the first to condemn it. Until then, am I supposed to just believe what the Daily Mail says about my son?\u201d Lane subsequently sends me the printouts of messaging exchanges they had with Jack while he claimed to be in hiding from Isis in Raqqa between March 2016 and July 2017. Initially he was trying to organise for them to send money so he could escape. Some of the exchanges between mother and son capture the cadences of family banter; others take in the surreal contrasts between Oxford and Raqqa, food shopping and Russian air strikes. Often Jack responds to questions about his safety, about his lack of money, with a belief that Allah will provide. In order to be sure it was Jack talking, Lane occasionally asked him little bits about his past. In one of the last messages, after the fall of Raqqa, there is the following exchange: Sally: I\u2019ve been so worried. OK, I\u2019ll test you. What was the name of the head of discipline at your school who gave u C3s? Are u OK? Jack: I\u2019m fine, Mr Davis? Sally: Yes Jack: So many people used to give me c3s. What\u2019s new? I\u2019m out by the way. Sally: We\u2019ve been worried sick. Out of the country????? Jack: Out of what they call Isis territories. In them, too, in between doctrinal religious quotation, you get a little sense of Jack\u2019s quick wit \u2013 if things had taken just a slightly different turn, Sally tells me at one point, she\u2019d imagined Jack would have not been in a war in Syria but on the stage at the Edinburgh fringe with his friends. One of the unspoken subtexts of the court case was the way Jack\u2019s conversion to Islam, when he was 16, seemed to exacerbate his OCD. Did they recognise that link? \u201cHe had cognitive behavioural therapy for the OCD when he was younger,\u201d Lane says, \u201cand that seemed to work. But it came back again after he converted. One doctor actually told us that the religion was a useful vehicle for his OCD. With all the praying and washing.\u201d \u201cSome Muslims Jack knew had told him that [the OCD] was the evil spirits of the djinn that had been sent to test him \u2013 a load of crap \u2013 and that the solution was to wash more, pray more,\u201d John says. \u201cHe was getting up at two o\u2019clock in the morning and praying, and washing, so he never slept more than a couple of hours. He started to fall asleep in class \u2013 A-levels became impossible.\u201d Alongside those habits they concede that Jack developed an obsessive \u201csearch for the truth\u201d. He read everything he could find about Islam and about what a perfect Muslim was. \u201cHe had this massive grammar book of Arabic that he would carry everywhere with him,\u201d Lane says. \u201cHe took it to America on holiday with him.\u201d \u201cAll OCD is about fear, if you don\u2019t go through the rituals then something bad will happen,\u201d Letts says. \u201cIn Islam that becomes, if you don\u2019t [live according to the religion] you are going to burn in hell. He was obsessed with not doing something wrong. That is why he wanted to learn Arabic so he could be the best Muslim he could be.\u201d It is also, it appears, one reason why he ended up in Islamic State, to test those abstract notions against reality. His parents want to believe he was quite quickly disillusioned. They admit that they do not know what Jack was doing in Syria for several months. But when he reconnected with them in early 2016 he was, according to their reading of his often cryptic messages, holed up in friends\u2019 houses in Raqqa, dodging Russian bombardment, nursing a shrapnel wound. Their faith in him still being who he was is what sustains them, really. Is it possible for them, I ask, to entertain the idea that he had been brainwashed, targeted by people who might seek to radicalise him? \u201cWhat you are saying is: are we in denial about him?\u201d Letts says. \u201cThat is what everyone is throwing at us\u2026\u201d I say I can only imagine the difficulty of wrestling with the idea of the boy they loved so much and this different man who is being presented. In January 2015, Jack got married to the daughter of an Iraqi tribal leader and they subsequently had a baby. Was that in character for the boy they knew? \u201cI wasn\u2019t surprised he got married,\u201d Letts says. \u201cThough I was disappointed not to have been at his wedding. He shows me a message in Arabic Jack tried to send to his wife through the Red Cross, a love letter: \u2018I tried to get to you and little Mo in Mosul three times and I couldn\u2019t get through \u2013 Isis were going to kill me. I will never stop trying to find you even if it takes 40 years.\u2019\u201d Lane says she thinks of the apparent ease of Jack\u2019s integration into Sunni Iraqi society in terms of a family holiday they had in Morocco when he was 17. \u201cJack just had dinner with a different set of people each night. He\u2019d get talking to people and they would invite him back to their house. That is the way he was.\u201d The prosecution took close account of one email that John sent to a friend, soon after they first heard the devastating news that Jack was in Syria. \u201cI\u2019ve lost him,\u201d Letts wrote. \u201cI feel terrified, betrayed by Jack, embarrassed, massively let down. I know he\u2019s not a nasty boy. But he\u2019s very stupid and I created him, with my armchair revolutionary shite.\u201d What did he mean by that? \u201cI was in shock and fearing the worst,\u201d Letts says, \u201cand feeling guilty that I had raised him to support the underdog.\u201d He points to the fact that in the past he had been involved in campaigning about East Timor, for example, to the extent that they had Timorese activists living in the spare room. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call myself a radical lefty as some people are doing. But certainly Jack was raised to question oppression and imperialism. We took him on the Iraq war march and all this kind of stuff. And at that moment [when I first heard he was in Syria] I was thinking, \u2018Am I reaping what I sowed?\u2019 That\u2019s all.\u201d If they are guilty of anything, it seems to me, it is of a style of parenting determined to respect above all the individuality of their teenage son, his right to be intellectually curious, to pursue \u201cgrand adventures\u201d. Hindsight is a wonderful thing, but is that something they recognise? I have two regrets,\u201d Letts says. \u201cOne is that when he converted to Islam I didn\u2019t walk with him on that path, by being more attentive to what he was doing. But, you know, my business was going under and I was trying to farm and for a time I maybe didn\u2019t give him the time I should have. He saw me probably as this atheist dad who had arguments with him and I maybe should have backed up and said, you know, just \u2018that\u2019s interesting, son\u2019. And the second is that I think now his OCD was worse than we ever addressed. It was hard to get help for him when he was a child, and once he had become an adult there was little we could do. Those are my two regrets. But I honestly can\u2019t say I was worried when he left\u2026\u201d \u201cYou have to remember,\u201d Lane says, \u201che was going to Jordan with his mates\u2026\u201d While the legal battles have been front and centre, Lane and Letts\u2019s lives have fractured in other ways. A few good friends have stood by them but inevitable strains show between them as a couple. Their younger son, Tyler, 21, has been away at university for much of the ordeal, though his AS-level revision was thrown off course when the police seized a computer containing all his notes. The time consumed by the legal battle has left Letts and Lane in \u201ca deep financial hole\u201d. After Letts shared the painstaking results of his research, the movement he pioneered in heritage grains has picked up momentum without him. Lane has had to move from job to job, having been asked to leave several when colleagues discovered she was a \u201cterrorist suspect\u201d. On the morning that their trial began, they received a bailiff\u2019s letter to say their remaining possessions would be taken away. It seems a bit hopeless to ask them about hope, but I wonder if they can, with the trial over, think of getting their lives back on track? \u201cNot until Jack is safe,\u201d Lane says. \u201cI hope that is not long. There was an Italian handed over to the Italian government last week\u2026\u201d As a mother she says there\u2019s nothing she can enjoy until then; the baking summer afternoon outside is just a reminder of the heat in her son\u2019s prison. \u201cJack has become the most politicised figure of any of the detainees,\u201d Letts says. \u201cObviously [the authorities] would probably most like him to \u2018fall down the stairs\u2019. But we are not going to go away. I am hoping if we raise enough pressure, he becomes such a pain in the ass for everyone that they will hand him over too.\u201d They are, despite everything, Letts suggests, placing their faith in British \u2013 or Canadian \u2013 values: \u201cThe rule of law, innocent until proven guilty, the rights of the individual\u2026\u201d That, and their stubborn love for their son.",

      "body": "<p>When I was a child in the late 1980s, my brother and I would watch every Saturday morning as a crescent of teenagers gathered around an arcade machine in our local sports club. Even if we had been allowed to spend our pocket money on something as transient as an arcade game, there was no barging in here. All we could do was watch as the older boys jeered and cheered each other on, making it a little further each week as their skills improved and muscle memory set in.</p> <p>Diversion became ritual and, soon enough, a crowd stopped by to watch their weekly quest. I remember wishing that today \u2013 perhaps today! \u2013 would be the day they conquered the dragon and made it to the final credits. I remember the elation in the room when it finally happened, the backslaps and lingering grins.

Even if we had been allowed to spend our pocket money on something as transient as an arcade game, there was no barging in here. All we could do was watch as the older boys jeered and cheered each other on, making it a little further each week as their skills improved and muscle memory set in. Diversion became ritual and, soon enough, a crowd stopped by to watch their weekly quest. I remember wishing that today \u2013 perhaps today! \u2013 would be the day they conquered the dragon and made it to the final credits. I remember the elation in the room when it finally happened, the backslaps and lingering grins.

We\u2019ve had one major character, South Africa, all but savaged to death on the first page, yet still expected to limp on for five weeks pretending it\u2019s only a flesh wound. Australia are the new favourites, New Zealand\u2019s \u201cclinical\u201d label has long since peeled off and England\u2019s wayward route to the semis means no one can pretend to be able to guess the ending. Early scepticism about the schedule has been overturned, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/jun/20/england-sri-lanka-cricket-world-cup-preview\" title=\"\">reasserted itself</a> and dribbled away to the margins of our consciousness. There\u2019s been time for entire games to disappear, their memories obliterated by all that\u2019s followed.</p> <p>Time, too, for characters to assume some unexpected arcs of their own. My favourite player to watch this tournament has been Virat Kohli \u2013 and not for the stylish 60s and 70s he chips in almost every game. Instead, it has been fascinating to watch the infamously prickly, can-explode-will-explode India captain transform himself into the most proactively charming sporting visitor Britain has received since Keith Miller landed in \u201948 and made a beeline for Princess Margaret.</p> <p>This World Cup has been full of Kohli moments, tossed like a handful of magic beans up and down the country, fertilising a land of slow, wet wickets with star dust. Last week it was the sight of him walking into the stands at the end of the game against Bangladesh to meet Charulata Patel, the 87-year-old super-fan whose comforting\u2011granny-presence at India\u2019s games has gone viral. Kohli and Rohit Sharma went out to seek her blessing, and she placed her hands on their foreheads with tender, grandmaternal pride, more than earning her status as the most \u2019grammable granny in the UK right now.</p> <p>It was a heartwarming image to add to the digital album Kohli has been compiling \u2013 or is the word \u201ccurating\u201d? \u2013 on his trip to England. Here he is in the field, grinning like a fool in love, conducting sections of the crowd like Sir Simon Rattle. There he is poised atop a nub of moral high ground, commanding those same fans to be nicer to Australians. And wait, what\u2019s this, tucked at the end of the slideshow? An endlessly looping gif of his brotastic handshake with Chris Gayle, capturing the very instant that cricket\u2019s mantle of cool passed from one legend to another.</p> <p>It has begged the question, what happened to the real Kohli? Only six months ago, we had watched as he spent a day <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/dec/17/australia-captain-tim-paine-sledging-spat-virat-kohli-india-second-test-perth-cricket\" title=\"\">spatting with the Australia Test captain, Tim Paine</a>, narrowly avoiding a chests-out confrontation in the field. This was the Virat we knew. The one who sought out conflict and siphoned it into his veins to give him superhuman strength, whether duelling with Mitchell Johnson in Melbourne or erupting at Steve Smith in Bangalore. The man who, only this May, so wound up Nigel Llong at the IPL that the umpire had to pay for the damage when he dented a door, kicking it in anger.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/05/engalnd-world-cup-action-plan-two-games-from-history\">Two games from history: England\u2019s action plan for World Cup glory | Rob Smyth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>World Cup Kohli, by contrast, shrugged and laughed, whether in the field or under the helmet. World Cup Kohli didn\u2019t rise to the bait when Kagiso Rabada called him immature; he put on some spectacles, praised his adversary\u2019s world-class bowling skills and said they\u2019d discuss it man to man. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/16/virat-kohli-india-pakistan-world-cup\" title=\"\">World Cup Kohli even walked</a> \u2013 walked! \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/16/pakistan-india-cricket-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">against Pakistan</a>. It was a shame he hadn\u2019t actually edged the ball. Still, one for his scrapbook of sportsmanship and humility.</p> <p>There are theories about where the new figure of World Cup Kohli has come from. Some believe it to be a clever alter ego, a cunning new way for the India captain to assert himself on the arena. Think of it as weaponised magnanimity: an aggressively alpha male move to dominate the space around him, and to make the tournament about Kohli even when it deserves to be about others.</p> <p>Or it might be pure brand positioning: Kohli is in every Indian household already, but this tournament is his shop window to the rest of the world. And he has a lot of products to sell, be they his shoes or his clothes or his body sprays for men, or his just-launched, UK-only protein-packed chocolate bars. As a romantic, I prefer Kohli\u2019s own faintly schmaltzy suggestion that his glamorous actor wife has been a calming influence.</p> <p>Either way, there are hints that World Cup Kohli may be on his way out. Shades of Original Virat \u2013 next season\u2019s body spray fragrance, patent pending \u2013 are already flickering on to our screens. The throbbing vein in his neck has made a reappearance of late: witness his annoyance at the short boundary in the England game, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/23/virat-kohli-fined-excessive-appealing-india-afghanistan-cricket-world-cup\" title=\"\">the lost DRS review against Bangladesh</a>. And as Original Virat\u2019s finger finds itself pointing a send-off to Soumya Sarkar, we shouldn\u2019t be surprised if this six-week saga turns out to have a final plot twist left for the India captain.</p>",

If you recorded every game of the Cricket World Cup so far \u2013 thank you, series link \u2013 and watched them back to back you wouldn\u2019t get off the sofa for a full fortnight. You\u2019d also be a gibbering, disassociated mess. Even for a sport that has always embraced long-form storytelling, a Cricket World Cup is an absurd epic, a Don Quixote of a tournament full of false starts and nonlinear narrative. We\u2019ve had one major character, South Africa, all but savaged to death on the first page, yet still expected to limp on for five weeks pretending it\u2019s only a flesh wound. Australia are the new favourites, New Zealand\u2019s \u201cclinical\u201d label has long since peeled off and England\u2019s wayward route to the semis means no one can pretend to be able to guess the ending. Early scepticism about the schedule has been overturned, reasserted itself and dribbled away to the margins of our consciousness. There\u2019s been time for entire games to disappear, their memories obliterated by all that\u2019s followed. Time, too, for characters to assume some unexpected arcs of their own. My favourite player to watch this tournament has been Virat Kohli \u2013 and not for the stylish 60s and 70s he chips in almost every game. Instead, it has been fascinating to watch the infamously prickly, can-explode-will-explode India captain transform himself into the most proactively charming sporting visitor Britain has received since Keith Miller landed in \u201948 and made a beeline for Princess Margaret. This World Cup has been full of Kohli moments, tossed like a handful of magic beans up and down the country, fertilising a land of slow, wet wickets with star dust. Last week it was the sight of him walking into the stands at the end of the game against Bangladesh to meet Charulata Patel, the 87-year-old super-fan whose comforting\u2011granny-presence at India\u2019s games has gone viral. Kohli and Rohit Sharma went out to seek her blessing, and she placed her hands on their foreheads with tender, grandmaternal pride, more than earning her status as the most \u2019grammable granny in the UK right now. It was a heartwarming image to add to the digital album Kohli has been compiling \u2013 or is the word \u201ccurating\u201d? \u2013 on his trip to England. Here he is in the field, grinning like a fool in love, conducting sections of the crowd like Sir Simon Rattle. There he is poised atop a nub of moral high ground, commanding those same fans to be nicer to Australians. And wait, what\u2019s this, tucked at the end of the slideshow? An endlessly looping gif of his brotastic handshake with Chris Gayle, capturing the very instant that cricket\u2019s mantle of cool passed from one legend to another. It has begged the question, what happened to the real Kohli? Only six months ago, we had watched as he spent a day spatting with the Australia Test captain, Tim Paine, narrowly avoiding a chests-out confrontation in the field. This was the Virat we knew. The one who sought out conflict and siphoned it into his veins to give him superhuman strength, whether duelling with Mitchell Johnson in Melbourne or erupting at Steve Smith in Bangalore. The man who, only this May, so wound up Nigel Llong at the IPL that the umpire had to pay for the damage when he dented a door, kicking it in anger. World Cup Kohli, by contrast, shrugged and laughed, whether in the field or under the helmet. World Cup Kohli didn\u2019t rise to the bait when Kagiso Rabada called him immature; he put on some spectacles, praised his adversary\u2019s world-class bowling skills and said they\u2019d discuss it man to man. World Cup Kohli even walked \u2013 walked! \u2013 against Pakistan. It was a shame he hadn\u2019t actually edged the ball. Still, one for his scrapbook of sportsmanship and humility. There are theories about where the new figure of World Cup Kohli has come from. Some believe it to be a clever alter ego, a cunning new way for the India captain to assert himself on the arena. Think of it as weaponised magnanimity: an aggressively alpha male move to dominate the space around him, and to make the tournament about Kohli even when it deserves to be about others. Or it might be pure brand positioning: Kohli is in every Indian household already, but this tournament is his shop window to the rest of the world. And he has a lot of products to sell, be they his shoes or his clothes or his body sprays for men, or his just-launched, UK-only protein-packed chocolate bars. As a romantic, I prefer Kohli\u2019s own faintly schmaltzy suggestion that his glamorous actor wife has been a calming influence. Either way, there are hints that World Cup Kohli may be on his way out. Shades of Original Virat \u2013 next season\u2019s body spray fragrance, patent pending \u2013 are already flickering on to our screens. The throbbing vein in his neck has made a reappearance of late: witness his annoyance at the short boundary in the England game, the lost DRS review against Bangladesh. And as Original Virat\u2019s finger finds itself pointing a send-off to Soumya Sarkar, we shouldn\u2019t be surprised if this six-week saga turns out to have a final plot twist left for the India captain.",

The \u201cBasic Law\u201d constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2003:&nbsp;</b>Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2007:&nbsp;</b>The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive\u2019s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong&nbsp;Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2014:&nbsp;</b>The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of \u201cfake universal suffrage\u201d and \u201cfake democracy\u201d. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015,&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party\u2019s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2019:&nbsp;</b>Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/hong-kong-lam-to-withdraw-extradition-bill-say-reports\">Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Regina Ip, a pro-government politician and former security chief, said the government should not give in to people\u2019s political demands, saying it would set a \u201cdangerous precedent\u201d if the government were to give an amnesty to arrested protesters because it would see Hong Kong \u201crapidly descending into lawlessness\u201d.</p> \n<p>Many young people have expressed their sense of helplessness in the face of a political system in which they have little say.

It received increased scrutiny after featuring in the manifesto of the gunman who killed 51 people in the Christchurch attacks in New Zealand in March.</p> <p>Now the <a href=\"https://www.isdglobal.org/\" title=\"\">Institute for Strategic Dialogue</a> (ISD), a UK-based counter-extremist organisation, has found that the once-obscure ideology has moved into mainstream politics and is now referenced by figures including US president Donald Trump, Italian interior minister Matteo Salvini and Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke of the German Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD).</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/1/14/18181897/trump-pat-buchanan-column-tweet\" title=\"\">Tweets</a> from Trump earlier this year, for example, were interpreted by many as making a white nationalist case for his controversial border wall.</p> <p>Despite its French origins, the ISD\u2019s analysis has revealed that the theory is becoming more prevalent internationally, with English-speaking countries now accounting for 33% of online discussion.</p> <p>Julia Ebner, co-author of the report at ISD, said: \u201cIt\u2019s shocking to see the extent to which extreme-right concepts such as the \u2018great replacement\u2019 theory and calls for \u2018remigration\u2019 have entered mainstream political discourse and are now referenced by politicians who head states and sit in parliaments.\u201d</p> <p>She said that of the 10 most influential Twitter accounts propagating the ideology, eight were French. The other two were Trump\u2019s account and the extreme-right site Defend Europa.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>To prevent future far-right terrorist acts, we need a more proactive, globally coordinated response</p> <footer> <cite>Julia Ebner, report co-author</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The study reveals that alternative social media platforms, image boards, fringe forums and encrypted chat channels are instrumental in diffusing influential ideologies that propagate hatred and violence. Far-right propagandists primarily use mainstream platforms such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter as avenues to disseminate material to audiences, while fringe platforms remain safe havens for the initiated to radicalise further.</p> <p>The new media ecosystem has been used, for instance, to promote the fear of a \u201cwhite genocide\u201d, a topic that is active across unregulated image-board threads on 8chan and 4chan, censorship-free discussion platforms such as Voat, ultra-libertarian social-media sites such as Gab and Minds, and closed-chat channels. By using MIT tool <a href=\"https://mediacloud.org/\" title=\"\">MediaCloud</a> to collect data, researchers have found that traditional media sites are found within the top 15 sources and are responsible for roughly 7% of total coverage of the term \u201cremigration\u201d alone.</p> <p>Defined as a form of ethnic cleansing through the forced deportation of minority communities, the concept of \u201cremigration\u201d has been a particularly fevered subject. Since 2014, the volume of tweets featuring the word has surged, rising from 66,000 in 2014 to 150,000 in 2018. The first stark increase in conversation around the theory occurred in November 2014, coinciding with the first annual meeting on remigration organised in Paris by <a href=\"https://www.generation-identity.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Generation Identity</a>.</p> <p>ISD researchers are currently embedded in 50 extreme-right chat channels on applications such as Discord, Telegram and WhatsApp, as well as monitoring groups, communities and discussion boards on 4chan, 8chan, Gab, Minds, Voat and Reddit.</p> <p>Jacob Davey, co-author of the report at ISD, said: \u201cSocial media platforms are built to promote clickbait content to get more users liking, sharing and commenting. This research shows how the extreme right is exploiting this to boost hateful content in the form of memes, distorted statistics and pseudo-scientific studies.\u201d</p> <p>Through slick branding and savvy online campaigns, the far-right identitarian youth movement, whose members include neo-Nazis, has been instrumental in spreading far-right propaganda online. The report provides comprehensive evidence of how the \u201cgreat replacement\u201d and \u201cwhite genocide\u201d theories have influenced violent attacks, and shows their ongoing impact on political rhetoric in north America and Europe. Calls for action from tech companies and governments to regulate the spread of extremist ideas have been swift.</p> <p>\u201cThe far right is able to take ownership of the \u2018grey zone\u2019 around contentious issues like migration because politicians and society are less willing to take on the role of thought leaders in these areas for fear of public outcry and outrage,\u201d said Ebner.</p> <p>\u201cThe international far right\u2019s potential to incite violence has been systematically underestimated and neglected by governments, security forces and tech firms over the past decade. To prevent future far-right terrorist acts, we need a more proactive, globally coordinated response, as we had in the global response to jihadism.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The extreme rightwing ideology that inspired the Christchurch mosque killer has been promoted so effectively by the far right that it has entered mainstream political discourse, new analysis reveals. Researchers have found that organised far-right networks are pushing a conspiracy known as the \u201cgreat replacement\u201d theory to the extent that references to it online have doubled in four years, with more than 1.5 million on Twitter alone, a total that is rising exponentially. The theory emerged in France in 2014 and has become a dominant concept of the extreme right, focusing on a paranoia that white people are being wiped out through migration and violence. It received increased scrutiny after featuring in the manifesto of the gunman who killed 51 people in the Christchurch attacks in New Zealand in March. Now the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), a UK-based counter-extremist organisation, has found that the once-obscure ideology has moved into mainstream politics and is now referenced by figures including US president Donald Trump, Italian interior minister Matteo Salvini and Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke of the German Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD). Tweets from Trump earlier this year, for example, were interpreted by many as making a white nationalist case for his controversial border wall. Despite its French origins, the ISD\u2019s analysis has revealed that the theory is becoming more prevalent internationally, with English-speaking countries now accounting for 33% of online discussion. Julia Ebner, co-author of the report at ISD, said: \u201cIt\u2019s shocking to see the extent to which extreme-right concepts such as the \u2018great replacement\u2019 theory and calls for \u2018remigration\u2019 have entered mainstream political discourse and are now referenced by politicians who head states and sit in parliaments.\u201d She said that of the 10 most influential Twitter accounts propagating the ideology, eight were French. The other two were Trump\u2019s account and the extreme-right site Defend Europa. The study reveals that alternative social media platforms, image boards, fringe forums and encrypted chat channels are instrumental in diffusing influential ideologies that propagate hatred and violence. Far-right propagandists primarily use mainstream platforms such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter as avenues to disseminate material to audiences, while fringe platforms remain safe havens for the initiated to radicalise further. The new media ecosystem has been used, for instance, to promote the fear of a \u201cwhite genocide\u201d, a topic that is active across unregulated image-board threads on 8chan and 4chan, censorship-free discussion platforms such as Voat, ultra-libertarian social-media sites such as Gab and Minds, and closed-chat channels. By using MIT tool MediaCloud to collect data, researchers have found that traditional media sites are found within the top 15 sources and are responsible for roughly 7% of total coverage of the term \u201cremigration\u201d alone. Defined as a form of ethnic cleansing through the forced deportation of minority communities, the concept of \u201cremigration\u201d has been a particularly fevered subject. Since 2014, the volume of tweets featuring the word has surged, rising from 66,000 in 2014 to 150,000 in 2018. The first stark increase in conversation around the theory occurred in November 2014, coinciding with the first annual meeting on remigration organised in Paris by Generation Identity. ISD researchers are currently embedded in 50 extreme-right chat channels on applications such as Discord, Telegram and WhatsApp, as well as monitoring groups, communities and discussion boards on 4chan, 8chan, Gab, Minds, Voat and Reddit. Jacob Davey, co-author of the report at ISD, said: \u201cSocial media platforms are built to promote clickbait content to get more users liking, sharing and commenting. This research shows how the extreme right is exploiting this to boost hateful content in the form of memes, distorted statistics and pseudo-scientific studies.\u201d Through slick branding and savvy online campaigns, the far-right identitarian youth movement, whose members include neo-Nazis, has been instrumental in spreading far-right propaganda online. The report provides comprehensive evidence of how the \u201cgreat replacement\u201d and \u201cwhite genocide\u201d theories have influenced violent attacks, and shows their ongoing impact on political rhetoric in north America and Europe. Calls for action from tech companies and governments to regulate the spread of extremist ideas have been swift. \u201cThe far right is able to take ownership of the \u2018grey zone\u2019 around contentious issues like migration because politicians and society are less willing to take on the role of thought leaders in these areas for fear of public outcry and outrage,\u201d said Ebner. \u201cThe international far right\u2019s potential to incite violence has been systematically underestimated and neglected by governments, security forces and tech firms over the past decade. To prevent future far-right terrorist acts, we need a more proactive, globally coordinated response, as we had in the global response to jihadism.\u201d",

Their friendship has continued, with Kate even cutting the ribbon to open this very shop in 2018 \u2013 it now being one of 56 stand-alone Stella McCartney stores around the world, which all stay true to their founder\u2019s environmentalist roots by using only LED lighting, saving 75% of the power of traditional bulbs, and sustainable wood and paper. The UK shops are all fuelled by wind power.</p> <p>\u201cOh yes the Moss is here, in many ways,\u201d the McCartney agrees.

It\u2019s a gift. All hand-drawn with individual gels and, you know, who today in the world of music is going to create an animated film like that? Who on earth has created a body of work like that? I can\u2019t name anyone.\u201d</p> <p>McCartney lives in west London (as well as in the countryside, where she rides horses) and is married to Alasdhair Willis, with whom she has four children. Her unwavering moral commitments have put her in an interesting position as an activist in the fashion business, which she describes as the second most harmful industry to the planet. \u201cIt\u2019s my intention to stand shoulder to shoulder with the conventional houses and show that you can actually be respectful in your supply chain and manufacture.\u201d</p> <p>To which end, she\u2019s created alternatives not just to leather and fur, but also to all sorts of other materials, such as PVC, because its chemical production is so harmful, \u201cand they say it\u2019s cancerous to the people who work with it, and then the residue runs into the rivers because the factories are built on rivers\u201d. It has taken her 10 years of innovation to make a clear shoe without using it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If everyone else was sustainable, we could have a level playing field, so it does feel unfair \u2013 but it\u2019s my choice</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Is it satisfying to have to work hard on the invention side of things? \u201cNo. It\u2019s not like I go, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m not going to use PVC because the challenge will make me more creative.\u2019 It\u2019s like, \u2018Well, that fucking sucks, and I\u2019ve also only got three sequins that I can use in two colourways as opposed to 5,000 that everyone else will use.\u2019 If everyone else was sustainable, we could have a level playing field, so it does feel unfair \u2013 but it\u2019s my choice and I believe very much in my reasons for working in that way. You know what? It\u2019s not like I\u2019m here for an easy life.\u201d</p> <p>She says recent changes in the industry, with other designers waking up to the planet, are led by people power. \u201cThese recent changes are consumer-driven. I don\u2019t think our industry would be doing that if the customers weren\u2019t demanding it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb083b6f347a67f6b5fc6c94206a83614d5bc586\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb083b6f347a67f6b5fc6c94206a83614d5bc586/0_0_2041_3000/680.jpg\" alt=\"Dress to impress: Stella McCartney with her husband Alasdhair Willis.\" width=\"680\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dress to impress: Stella McCartney with her husband Alasdhair Willis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Marsland/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So it\u2019s simply a capitalist response to the market? \u201cI think so, yeah, and that\u2019s OK, because that\u2019s capitalism, you know, that\u2019s what happens. But now is the time, as a consumer, to really understand. We\u2019re going to have to push the people in power. And how fucking amazing is it that it\u2019s 15, 16-year-olds who are doing that? Thank God for them.\u201d</p> <p>She recently bought back her brand in its entirety, having previously sold a 50% stake to French investors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/mar/28/stella-mccartney-designer-buys-kering-stake-fashion-label\" title=\"\">Kering</a>. I wonder if she stays at work late into the night. \u201cOh fuck no. I\u2019m very passionate about my art. And when you\u2019re in it, you\u2019re in it. But if somebody says, \u2018Hey you could stay here until 2am, or you could go and ride your horse with your kids, bareback,\u2019 I\u2019d take option two. Any day of the week. Eating a bag of chips.\u201d She found her own buyout \u201creinvigorating\u201d and did it to \u201cprotect my name, my history \u2013 it was kind of about heritage and family and continuation\u201d.</p> <p>Does this mean that her two daughters and two sons, who are aged between eight and 14, will take over the business one day? \u201cI don\u2019t know. Of course one side of me is like, \u2018I want the kids to do this.\u2019 But then it\u2019s like, is that my ego? I don\u2019t want to put that pressure on them. My mum and dad didn\u2019t go, \u2018Right, you\u2019re going to be writing all the next albums.\u2019 The kids should just do what they want to do.\u201d Indeed, she recently watched <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/aug/02/succession-review-brilliant-dissection-mega-rich-family-jesse-armstrong\" title=\"\">Succession</a></em>, a TV drama about a media dynasty that battles over who will inherit the family business, and \u201cfound it a bit depressing, actually\u201d.</p> <p>Fashion means everything to her, though. She even wants to analyse my outfit. \u201cPsychologically,\u201d she says, \u201cI find it incredibly interesting that you chose a vintage-esque, ethnic, quilted cotton coat to wear today. It\u2019s a very feminine piece, probably women made it. It says you probably celebrate some kind of hand touch, heritage, some kind of travel.\u201d The gold cuffs on my shirt, \u201calso tells a lot about you, that little bit of Lurex peeping out\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"030f4370c97045ee83d38de061678f7f5c621f21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/030f4370c97045ee83d38de061678f7f5c621f21/0_0_4765_3177/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The kids should just do what they want to do\u2019.

Stella bursts out laughing, almost barking with amusement that I would use my precious last moments on this topic.</p> <p>\u201cI <em>love</em> you,\u201d she says, \u201cthis is such a great, random question. OK, so I went to St Martins when I was a baby and in my free time I studied on Savile Row to be a bespoke tailor. It was a very masculine world, incredible, obsessed.\u201d</p> <p>Were you the only girl in the room? \u201cI was the only girl who had ever been in the room. I was there for three years and I barely learned how to set a sleeve head in a sleeve. It\u2019s like architecture. It\u2019s amazing. And the rule on a bespoke suit is you do <em>not</em> clean it. You do not touch it. You let the dirt dry and you brush it off. Basically, in life, rule of thumb: if you don\u2019t absolutely have to clean anything, don\u2019t clean it. I wouldn\u2019t change my bra every day and I don\u2019t just chuck stuff into a washing machine because it\u2019s been worn. I am incredibly hygienic myself, but I\u2019m not a fan of dry cleaning or any cleaning, really.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"840c79aa6ef8d1d59da38fd38a46e575526eeba1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/840c79aa6ef8d1d59da38fd38a46e575526eeba1/0_0_2639_3518/750.jpg\" alt=\"Menswear from the All Together Now collection worn on model\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Menswear from the All Together Now collection worn on model</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Benson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then her assistant whisks me away, urged by Stella to show me around even more of the shop, because building it \u201ckilled me.

I came away feeling really inspired, like I had to do something with it.\u201d I tell her that I recently showed it to my fascinated seven-year-old and it reawakened childhood memories of having my mind blown at a similar age, as if you could almost get drunk on the psychedelic imagery. \u201cI agree completely. It\u2019s a gift. All hand-drawn with individual gels and, you know, who today in the world of music is going to create an animated film like that? Who on earth has created a body of work like that? I can\u2019t name anyone.\u201d McCartney lives in west London (as well as in the countryside, where she rides horses) and is married to Alasdhair Willis, with whom she has four children. Her unwavering moral commitments have put her in an interesting position as an activist in the fashion business, which she describes as the second most harmful industry to the planet. \u201cIt\u2019s my intention to stand shoulder to shoulder with the conventional houses and show that you can actually be respectful in your supply chain and manufacture.\u201d To which end, she\u2019s created alternatives not just to leather and fur, but also to all sorts of other materials, such as PVC, because its chemical production is so harmful, \u201cand they say it\u2019s cancerous to the people who work with it, and then the residue runs into the rivers because the factories are built on rivers\u201d. It has taken her 10 years of innovation to make a clear shoe without using it. Is it satisfying to have to work hard on the invention side of things? \u201cNo. It\u2019s not like I go, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m not going to use PVC because the challenge will make me more creative.\u2019 It\u2019s like, \u2018Well, that fucking sucks, and I\u2019ve also only got three sequins that I can use in two colourways as opposed to 5,000 that everyone else will use.\u2019 If everyone else was sustainable, we could have a level playing field, so it does feel unfair \u2013 but it\u2019s my choice and I believe very much in my reasons for working in that way. You know what? It\u2019s not like I\u2019m here for an easy life.\u201d She says recent changes in the industry, with other designers waking up to the planet, are led by people power. \u201cThese recent changes are consumer-driven. I don\u2019t think our industry would be doing that if the customers weren\u2019t demanding it.\u201d So it\u2019s simply a capitalist response to the market? \u201cI think so, yeah, and that\u2019s OK, because that\u2019s capitalism, you know, that\u2019s what happens. But now is the time, as a consumer, to really understand. We\u2019re going to have to push the people in power. And how fucking amazing is it that it\u2019s 15, 16-year-olds who are doing that? Thank God for them.\u201d She recently bought back her brand in its entirety, having previously sold a 50% stake to French investors Kering. I wonder if she stays at work late into the night. \u201cOh fuck no. I\u2019m very passionate about my art. And when you\u2019re in it, you\u2019re in it. But if somebody says, \u2018Hey you could stay here until 2am, or you could go and ride your horse with your kids, bareback,\u2019 I\u2019d take option two. Any day of the week. Eating a bag of chips.\u201d She found her own buyout \u201creinvigorating\u201d and did it to \u201cprotect my name, my history \u2013 it was kind of about heritage and family and continuation\u201d. Does this mean that her two daughters and two sons, who are aged between eight and 14, will take over the business one day? \u201cI don\u2019t know. Of course one side of me is like, \u2018I want the kids to do this.\u2019 But then it\u2019s like, is that my ego? I don\u2019t want to put that pressure on them. My mum and dad didn\u2019t go, \u2018Right, you\u2019re going to be writing all the next albums.\u2019 The kids should just do what they want to do.\u201d Indeed, she recently watched Succession, a TV drama about a media dynasty that battles over who will inherit the family business, and \u201cfound it a bit depressing, actually\u201d. Fashion means everything to her, though. She even wants to analyse my outfit. \u201cPsychologically,\u201d she says, \u201cI find it incredibly interesting that you chose a vintage-esque, ethnic, quilted cotton coat to wear today. It\u2019s a very feminine piece, probably women made it. It says you probably celebrate some kind of hand touch, heritage, some kind of travel.\u201d The gold cuffs on my shirt, \u201calso tells a lot about you, that little bit of Lurex peeping out\u201d. She\u2019s not so keen on my leather boots, oops, (\u201cPeople don\u2019t bring leather into me, generally\u2026\u201d) but, tragically, it\u2019s my face that says most about me, which will teach me not to make such an effort next time. \u201cAnd then you\u2019ve got your red lip and\u2026 you know, you\u2019ve got a lot of makeup on,\u201d Stella McCartney notes, staring at my head. A pettier person than I might respond that she is wearing exactly as much makeup herself, only it\u2019s all in neutral shades just like her outfit \u2013 but I\u2019m not, so I won\u2019t. The publicist tells me there is time for me to ask one last question, so I use my precious minute to ask what she thinks of dry cleaning. Do we actually need it in the world today? Stella bursts out laughing, almost barking with amusement that I would use my precious last moments on this topic. \u201cI love you,\u201d she says, \u201cthis is such a great, random question. OK, so I went to St Martins when I was a baby and in my free time I studied on Savile Row to be a bespoke tailor. It was a very masculine world, incredible, obsessed.\u201d Were you the only girl in the room? \u201cI was the only girl who had ever been in the room. I was there for three years and I barely learned how to set a sleeve head in a sleeve. It\u2019s like architecture. It\u2019s amazing. And the rule on a bespoke suit is you do not clean it. You do not touch it. You let the dirt dry and you brush it off. Basically, in life, rule of thumb: if you don\u2019t absolutely have to clean anything, don\u2019t clean it. I wouldn\u2019t change my bra every day and I don\u2019t just chuck stuff into a washing machine because it\u2019s been worn. I am incredibly hygienic myself, but I\u2019m not a fan of dry cleaning or any cleaning, really.\u201d And then her assistant whisks me away, urged by Stella to show me around even more of the shop, because building it \u201ckilled me. I had no interior designer and no architect, we did it all in-house.\u201d So the assistant leads me into a downstairs lavatory, naturally, because \u201ccelebrities have signed their autographs on the wall,\u201d she explains, trying to find some names to show me but finding only that of Keith Lemon, who has written a pee joke. And then I find one myself, a message signed with a name that looks an awful lot like Alasdhair. Is this Stella\u2019s husband, I ask? Oh yes, the assistant says! \u201cI JUST WANT MY WIFE BACK,\u201d it reads. All Together Now launches tomorrow, available in Stella McCartney stores, at stellamccartney.com and farfetch.com",

She arrived here as a curiosity: the youngest qualifier in the tournament\u2019s history and the first 15-year-old to compete in the main draw for a decade. The day before her first qualifying match, she was up until 11pm, not \u2013 as the Australian maverick <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/04/nick-kyrgios-unusual-prematch-prep-rafael-nadal-defeat\" title=\"\">Nick Kyrgios</a> was before playing Rafael Nadal \u2013 at the Dog &amp; Fox pub in Wimbledon village, but completing a science exam.

Her matches have attracted the largest TV audiences and the most boisterous roars on Henman Hill. \u201cShe\u2019s the talk of the United States,\u201d said John McEnroe on Friday night, after Gauff had saved two heart-stopping match points and overcome <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/05/cori-gauff-polona-hercog\" title=\"\">Slovenia\u2019s Polona Hercog</a> on Centre Court. \u201cShe\u2019s the talk of the world in a way.\u201d</p> <p>Gauff, meanwhile, is doing an excellent impression of someone unfazed by the attention. \u201cI know this is off-topic,\u201d she began her press conference after the Hercog victory, \u201cbut I wanted to say please stream <em>Erys</em> by Jaden Smith. His album dropped yesterday.\u201d She seemed most excited by the fact that footage of her mother chest-thumping after she won a critical tie-break had gone viral: \u201cPlease tell me she\u2019s a meme. I\u2019m so excited to go on Instagram.\u201d When asked what she would do with her prize money, which is a guaranteed \u00a3176,000, she raised a quizzical eyebrow. \u201cI mean, I can\u2019t buy a car, because I can\u2019t drive,\u201d she replied. \u201cI hate spending money, to be honest. Maybe I\u2019m going to buy some more MSFTSrep, which is Jaden\u2019s line, buy some hoodies from that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be89e41c5ff2457606c7f3429ada48ba3bca6446\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be89e41c5ff2457606c7f3429ada48ba3bca6446/49_20_3516_2109/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Canada\u2019s Felix Auger-Aliassime, 18, said \u2018the pressure got to me,\u2019 after his third-round defeat during his first Wimbledon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Canada\u2019s Felix Auger-Aliassime, 18, said \u2018the pressure got to me,\u2019 after his third-round defeat last week during his first Wimbledon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Teenage phenomena, of course, are nothing new in tennis. <a href=\"https://ausopen.com/history/great-champions/martina-hingis\" title=\"\">Martina Hingis</a> won the 1997 Australian Open aged 16, and five grand slams before the age of 19 (though no major singles titles after). A 17-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2004/jul/04/wimbledon2004.wimbledon4\" title=\"\">Maria Sharapova</a> won Wimbledon in 2004, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/1985/jul/08/wimbledon2002.wimbledon\" title=\"\">Boris Becker</a> had done at the same age in 1985. Bjorn Borg, Monica Seles, Tracy Austin, Michael Chang and Rafael Nadal were all teenage champions.</p> <p>But the tales of precocious success are matched and often overshadowed by the spectacular flame-outs that followed. Gauff is the youngest player to reach the fourth round at Wimbledon since the American teen sensation Jennifer Capriati. She achieved the feat in 1990, aged 14, and again the following year, when she beat Martina Navratilova on a run to the semi-final. Success, however, was far from straightforward for Capriati. At 17, she was arrested for shoplifting a $15 ring and possession of marijuana and she took a 14-month break from professional tennis. Her best results were all achieved in her mid-20s, when she won three grand slams.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/jul/05/wimbledon-2019-gauff-djokovic-williams-and-murray-in-action-live\">Wimbledon 2019: Gauff fights back to beat Hercog on Centre Court \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A big part of the fascination with Gauff is that her emergence defies the logic of the previous three decades. Teen tennis stars had begun to look as outdated as wooden rackets and linen slacks. All the evidence suggested that, due to improved training regimes, injury prevention and investment in back-room staff, players were peaking later and having longer careers. Federer, Nadal and Novak Djokovic have all thrived in their 30s, while 37-year-old Serena Williams remains the woman to beat, much as she has been for the past 20 years.</p> <p>Academic studies have also reinforced the idea that younger players are finding it harder to make a breakthrough. In 2018, a team from the <a href=\"https://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/featurednews/title_678259_en.html\" title=\"\">University of Exeter</a> analysed data on the first-serve speed and accuracy of the 100 highest-earning male and female players. \u201cWe found a clear peak in serve speed at the age of about 26, while accuracy peaked at around age 28,\u201d says Dr Ruth Archer, one of the authors. After these ages, speed and accuracy typically go backwards, but some individuals \u2013 Federer being a prime example \u2013 are able to offset any decline by playing smarter. \u201cThat is, if your serve speed decreases with age, but you get more accurate with experience,\u201d Dr Archer goes on, \u201cyou may be able to keep a competitive edge for longer.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s something inspiring about tennis players competing and still dominating in their thirties. But it can also be \u2013 whisper it \u2013 a bit dull. Alongside Gauff, the greatest buzz in the first week of Wimbledon surrounded 18-year-old Felix Auger-Aliassime from Canada. He lost on Friday \u2013 admitting that the \u201cpressure got to me\u2026 it was a bit embarrassing\u201d \u2013 but he has done enough at Queen\u2019s, where he made the semi-final, and at Wimbledon to suggest he\u2019s the real deal. John McEnroe, for one, has picked him as the man most likely to unseat the big three on the men\u2019s side.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the next generation have had mixed fortunes at Wimbledon. The 20-year-old Greek pretender Stefanos Tsitsipas arrived hotly tipped, but was on his way home after the first day. The Briton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/04/roger-federer-jay-clarke-wimbledon-dart-nishikori-norrie\" title=\"\">Jay Clarke</a>, also 20, had a dream match-up with Federer in the second round, but mainly made news for hooking up with Gauff in the mixed doubles \u2013 and dumping his doubles partner Harriet Dart (by text apparently). \u201cObviously, initially she [Dart] was very upset,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cShe had every right to be; I\u2019d be, too.</p> <p>As for why young players have struggled to make an impact, there are some more offbeat theories. On Friday, Mark Kovacs, a sports scientist who had worked with top American tennis players, suggested it was because Federer, Nadal and Djokovic are from \u201cthe last generation to grow up without cell phones as kids\u201d. The idea found support from Judy Murray: \u201cTennis is such a cerebral sport,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cPlayers need to think for themselves, solve their own problems and are constantly having to make quick decisions. Nowadays we have gadgets that do so much of that for us. Alexa, satnav etc.\u201d</p> <p>Gauff will not find it easy this week: Halep is a much sterner test than any she has faced so far. Nor is her success ordained going forwards. She is currently restricted to playing just 12 tournaments a year, a rule brought in by the Women\u2019s Tennis Association in 1994, partly in response to the problems that Capriati and other teenagers had faced. Only when Gauff is 18 will she be allowed to compete in as many events as she likes.</p> <p>What\u2019s clear is the life of a tennis prodigy is rarely simple, and Wimbledon 2019 has shown that, too. The Australian player Bernard Tomic was an extraordinary junior and at his first Wimbledon, in 2011 aged 18, he made the quarter-finals, the youngest player since Becker to do so. This year, though, was a rather short-lived affair: Tomic\u2019s Wimbledon lasted just 58 minutes and his performance was so desultory that the match referee <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/04/wimbledon-fine-bernard-tomic-45000-prize-money-lasck-of-effort-first-round-defeat-tennis\" title=\"\">docked his \u00a345,000 prize money</a> for not meeting the \u201crequired professional standard\u201d.</p> <p>Right now, everything is easy for Coco Gauff. Long may it remain so.</p> <h2>FORMER WIMBLEDON TEEN STARS</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da10e26644971c5193fb104b8e4213682df92f01\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da10e26644971c5193fb104b8e4213682df92f01/32_709_2919_1751/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lottie Dod: at 15, she was the youngest person to win a Wimbledon singels title, in 1887\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lottie Dod: at 15, she was the youngest person to win a Wimbledon singels title, in 1887.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: W. and D.

The teenage experience of Gauff, who on Monday plays former world No 1 Simona Halep in the fourth round, has a very different vibe. \u201cYou can kind of fake it until you make it, but I\u2019m not faking it, at least right now,\u201d she said last week, a week in which the American made her grand-slam debut, beat her hero and inspiration Venus Williams and became the most exciting new force in tennis for years, maybe decades. The emergence of Gauff has been the story of Wimbledon 2019. She arrived here as a curiosity: the youngest qualifier in the tournament\u2019s history and the first 15-year-old to compete in the main draw for a decade. The day before her first qualifying match, she was up until 11pm, not \u2013 as the Australian maverick Nick Kyrgios was before playing Rafael Nadal \u2013 at the Dog &amp; Fox pub in Wimbledon village, but completing a science exam. She scored a B, the only test she hasn\u2019t aced all week. Gauff, from Delray Beach, Florida, has inspired a frenzy usually reserved for homegrown players or Roger Federer. Her matches have attracted the largest TV audiences and the most boisterous roars on Henman Hill. \u201cShe\u2019s the talk of the United States,\u201d said John McEnroe on Friday night, after Gauff had saved two heart-stopping match points and overcome Slovenia\u2019s Polona Hercog on Centre Court. \u201cShe\u2019s the talk of the world in a way.\u201d Gauff, meanwhile, is doing an excellent impression of someone unfazed by the attention. \u201cI know this is off-topic,\u201d she began her press conference after the Hercog victory, \u201cbut I wanted to say please stream Erys by Jaden Smith. His album dropped yesterday.\u201d She seemed most excited by the fact that footage of her mother chest-thumping after she won a critical tie-break had gone viral: \u201cPlease tell me she\u2019s a meme. I\u2019m so excited to go on Instagram.\u201d When asked what she would do with her prize money, which is a guaranteed \u00a3176,000, she raised a quizzical eyebrow. \u201cI mean, I can\u2019t buy a car, because I can\u2019t drive,\u201d she replied. \u201cI hate spending money, to be honest. Maybe I\u2019m going to buy some more MSFTSrep, which is Jaden\u2019s line, buy some hoodies from that.\u201d Teenage phenomena, of course, are nothing new in tennis. Martina Hingis won the 1997 Australian Open aged 16, and five grand slams before the age of 19 (though no major singles titles after). A 17-year-old Maria Sharapova won Wimbledon in 2004, as Boris Becker had done at the same age in 1985. Bjorn Borg, Monica Seles, Tracy Austin, Michael Chang and Rafael Nadal were all teenage champions. But the tales of precocious success are matched and often overshadowed by the spectacular flame-outs that followed. Gauff is the youngest player to reach the fourth round at Wimbledon since the American teen sensation Jennifer Capriati. She achieved the feat in 1990, aged 14, and again the following year, when she beat Martina Navratilova on a run to the semi-final. Success, however, was far from straightforward for Capriati. At 17, she was arrested for shoplifting a $15 ring and possession of marijuana and she took a 14-month break from professional tennis. Her best results were all achieved in her mid-20s, when she won three grand slams. A big part of the fascination with Gauff is that her emergence defies the logic of the previous three decades. Teen tennis stars had begun to look as outdated as wooden rackets and linen slacks. All the evidence suggested that, due to improved training regimes, injury prevention and investment in back-room staff, players were peaking later and having longer careers. Federer, Nadal and Novak Djokovic have all thrived in their 30s, while 37-year-old Serena Williams remains the woman to beat, much as she has been for the past 20 years. Academic studies have also reinforced the idea that younger players are finding it harder to make a breakthrough. In 2018, a team from the University of Exeter analysed data on the first-serve speed and accuracy of the 100 highest-earning male and female players. \u201cWe found a clear peak in serve speed at the age of about 26, while accuracy peaked at around age 28,\u201d says Dr Ruth Archer, one of the authors. After these ages, speed and accuracy typically go backwards, but some individuals \u2013 Federer being a prime example \u2013 are able to offset any decline by playing smarter. \u201cThat is, if your serve speed decreases with age, but you get more accurate with experience,\u201d Dr Archer goes on, \u201cyou may be able to keep a competitive edge for longer.\u201d There\u2019s something inspiring about tennis players competing and still dominating in their thirties. But it can also be \u2013 whisper it \u2013 a bit dull. Alongside Gauff, the greatest buzz in the first week of Wimbledon surrounded 18-year-old Felix Auger-Aliassime from Canada. He lost on Friday \u2013 admitting that the \u201cpressure got to me\u2026 it was a bit embarrassing\u201d \u2013 but he has done enough at Queen\u2019s, where he made the semi-final, and at Wimbledon to suggest he\u2019s the real deal. John McEnroe, for one, has picked him as the man most likely to unseat the big three on the men\u2019s side. Elsewhere, the next generation have had mixed fortunes at Wimbledon. The 20-year-old Greek pretender Stefanos Tsitsipas arrived hotly tipped, but was on his way home after the first day. The Briton Jay Clarke, also 20, had a dream match-up with Federer in the second round, but mainly made news for hooking up with Gauff in the mixed doubles \u2013 and dumping his doubles partner Harriet Dart (by text apparently). \u201cObviously, initially she [Dart] was very upset,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cShe had every right to be; I\u2019d be, too. As for why young players have struggled to make an impact, there are some more offbeat theories. On Friday, Mark Kovacs, a sports scientist who had worked with top American tennis players, suggested it was because Federer, Nadal and Djokovic are from \u201cthe last generation to grow up without cell phones as kids\u201d. The idea found support from Judy Murray: \u201cTennis is such a cerebral sport,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cPlayers need to think for themselves, solve their own problems and are constantly having to make quick decisions. Nowadays we have gadgets that do so much of that for us. Alexa, satnav etc.\u201d Gauff will not find it easy this week: Halep is a much sterner test than any she has faced so far. Nor is her success ordained going forwards. She is currently restricted to playing just 12 tournaments a year, a rule brought in by the Women\u2019s Tennis Association in 1994, partly in response to the problems that Capriati and other teenagers had faced. Only when Gauff is 18 will she be allowed to compete in as many events as she likes. What\u2019s clear is the life of a tennis prodigy is rarely simple, and Wimbledon 2019 has shown that, too. The Australian player Bernard Tomic was an extraordinary junior and at his first Wimbledon, in 2011 aged 18, he made the quarter-finals, the youngest player since Becker to do so. This year, though, was a rather short-lived affair: Tomic\u2019s Wimbledon lasted just 58 minutes and his performance was so desultory that the match referee docked his \u00a345,000 prize money for not meeting the \u201crequired professional standard\u201d. Right now, everything is easy for Coco Gauff. Long may it remain so. FORMER WIMBLEDON TEEN STARS Lottie Dod The original prodigy, Dod is the youngest-ever winner of a Wimbledon singles title, triumphing in 1887 aged 15 years and 285 days. She played single-handed, then unorthodox, and wore a painful whalebone-and-metal corset. It was the first of five victories in Wimbledon \u2013 and in fact, Dod only lost five singles matches in her entire tennis career. She also excelled at golf, hockey and won a silver medal at the 1908 Olympics in archery. Boris Becker In 1985, aged 17, \u201cBoom Boom\u201d Becker became the first unseeded player to win Wimbledon. Known for his huge serve and diving volleys, he repeated his success the following year. Reflecting this week on those wins, Becker was grateful there was no social media back then: \u201cMy English was non-existent,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI was in a bubble and that really protected me.\u201d Jelena Dokic Aged 16, Dokic recorded one of the great upsets in Wimbledon history: thrashing world No1 Martina Hingis 6-2, 6-0 in the first round in 1999. She made it to the quarter-finals that year and the semis the following year. Off court, however, her life was turbulent: after the Wimbledon semi in 2000, she claims her father screamed at her, calling her pathetic and a \u201chopeless cow\u201d. (He has denied accusations of abuse.)",

      "body": "<p>Mary Berridge\u2019s mother was a glamorous interpreter employed by the British War Office in Rome during the 1940s. It was there that she met an English colonel, fell in love and, in 1947, left her family to marry and settle in England. In death, 72 years later, she wished to return to her native Rome, so Berridge contracted Co-operative Funeralcare in Seaford, East Sussex, to make the arrangements. The repatriation was scheduled for a Monday in May and she was advised to organise the funeral two days later in case of delays.</p> <p>Late on the Friday before the coffin was due to fly out, she contacted the Co-op to check the arrival time in Rome. Only then was she told that the flight had not been booked. The firm could not confirm when a new flight could be organised since the weekend was pending: the funeral had to be cancelled until further notice. \u201cFamily and friends were coming from all parts of Italy as well as from New York, Canada and France and about 15 people had to cancel their plane and train tickets,\u201d Berridge said. \u201cSome of the tickets were non-refundable and others incurred high cancellation charges.\u201d</p> <p>Berridge and her husband were left \u00a31,800 out of pocket after paying cancellation fees for flights and hotel, a contribution towards relatives\u2019 costs and charges from the Italian undertaker, who had to reorganise the funeral. They also had to reprint the funeral notice in the local paper.</p> <p>The body was eventually flown out a week later and only a third of the mourners who had promised to attend the funeral on the original date made it to the service.</p> <p>Berridge, who paid the Co-op nearly \u00a35,000 to organise the repatriation, claimed that staff seemed oblivious to the impact on the family. \u201cThey were very unhelpful, defensive and quite rude, and at no point apologised or showed any sensitivity to a very distressing situation,\u201d she said. \u201cThe email finally confirming when they would fly Mum out to Rome was signed off with \u2018Have a good day Mrs Berridge!\u2019, which I found insensitive if not downright offensive.\u201d</p> <p>Only when she returned from the funeral and raised a formal complaint did she receive an apology, she said. The company offered her \u00a3500 compensation, which it increased to \u00a3800, but when she tried to cash the cheque it was refused. \u201cI contacted the Co-op again to complain and they said they had passed the issue to their head office who would duly be in touch. They haven\u2019t. What sort of organisation not only messes up my mother\u2019s funeral and then bounces a compensation cheque?\u201d</p> <p>The Co-op told the <em>Observer</em> that a \u201cmiscommunication\u201d between its repatriation team and the funeral home caused the delay and that a \u201cmistake signing the cheque\u201d led to it bouncing. A spokesperson for the company said: \u201cWe are truly sorry for the upset that we have caused. We\u2019ve contacted Mrs Berridge directly to apologise for our failings and while we know we cannot put this right for her, we\u2019re doing what we can to see how we might make amends.\u201d</p> <p>It has since issued a new cheque for \u00a3800 and added \u00a3990 for her additional costs.</p> <p>Repatriation of bodies is a complex process involving extensive paperwork and detailed legal requirements. Martyn James of the complaints website Resolver says Berridge\u2019s experience is not an isolated incident. \u201cI know of at least five cases where the body has actually been lost in transit,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a firm lost an expensive painting we\u2019d be hearing about it nonstop, but expensive paintings don\u2019t get lost because valuables are tracked meticulously. Tracking should be standard on repatriations, so that if something does go wrong, the mistake is rectified straight away.\u201d</p> <p>This year the Competition and Markets Authority announced an investigation into the funeral industry after prices were found to have soared by almost three times the rate of inflation for a decade.

      "bodyText": "Mary Berridge\u2019s mother was a glamorous interpreter employed by the British War Office in Rome during the 1940s. It was there that she met an English colonel, fell in love and, in 1947, left her family to marry and settle in England. In death, 72 years later, she wished to return to her native Rome, so Berridge contracted Co-operative Funeralcare in Seaford, East Sussex, to make the arrangements. The repatriation was scheduled for a Monday in May and she was advised to organise the funeral two days later in case of delays. Late on the Friday before the coffin was due to fly out, she contacted the Co-op to check the arrival time in Rome. Only then was she told that the flight had not been booked. The firm could not confirm when a new flight could be organised since the weekend was pending: the funeral had to be cancelled until further notice. \u201cFamily and friends were coming from all parts of Italy as well as from New York, Canada and France and about 15 people had to cancel their plane and train tickets,\u201d Berridge said. \u201cSome of the tickets were non-refundable and others incurred high cancellation charges.\u201d Berridge and her husband were left \u00a31,800 out of pocket after paying cancellation fees for flights and hotel, a contribution towards relatives\u2019 costs and charges from the Italian undertaker, who had to reorganise the funeral. They also had to reprint the funeral notice in the local paper. The body was eventually flown out a week later and only a third of the mourners who had promised to attend the funeral on the original date made it to the service. Berridge, who paid the Co-op nearly \u00a35,000 to organise the repatriation, claimed that staff seemed oblivious to the impact on the family. \u201cThey were very unhelpful, defensive and quite rude, and at no point apologised or showed any sensitivity to a very distressing situation,\u201d she said. \u201cThe email finally confirming when they would fly Mum out to Rome was signed off with \u2018Have a good day Mrs Berridge!\u2019, which I found insensitive if not downright offensive.\u201d Only when she returned from the funeral and raised a formal complaint did she receive an apology, she said. The company offered her \u00a3500 compensation, which it increased to \u00a3800, but when she tried to cash the cheque it was refused. \u201cI contacted the Co-op again to complain and they said they had passed the issue to their head office who would duly be in touch. They haven\u2019t. What sort of organisation not only messes up my mother\u2019s funeral and then bounces a compensation cheque?\u201d The Co-op told the Observer that a \u201cmiscommunication\u201d between its repatriation team and the funeral home caused the delay and that a \u201cmistake signing the cheque\u201d led to it bouncing. A spokesperson for the company said: \u201cWe are truly sorry for the upset that we have caused. We\u2019ve contacted Mrs Berridge directly to apologise for our failings and while we know we cannot put this right for her, we\u2019re doing what we can to see how we might make amends.\u201d It has since issued a new cheque for \u00a3800 and added \u00a3990 for her additional costs. Repatriation of bodies is a complex process involving extensive paperwork and detailed legal requirements. Martyn James of the complaints website Resolver says Berridge\u2019s experience is not an isolated incident. \u201cI know of at least five cases where the body has actually been lost in transit,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a firm lost an expensive painting we\u2019d be hearing about it nonstop, but expensive paintings don\u2019t get lost because valuables are tracked meticulously. Tracking should be standard on repatriations, so that if something does go wrong, the mistake is rectified straight away.\u201d This year the Competition and Markets Authority announced an investigation into the funeral industry after prices were found to have soared by almost three times the rate of inflation for a decade. The average price charged by undertakers stands at \u00a34,200 and repatriations can double that. Despite the dire consequences when arrangements go wrong, there is no ombudsman to adjudicate if a funeral home fails to resolve a complaint. Instead, bereaved families have to use arbitration schemes operated by the two industry trade bodies, if the undertaker is a member of one, or else resort to court action. Nor can they rely on consumer protection if problems are caused by the air industry because the deceased do not qualify for compensation payments under EU rules if they are delayed. \u201cAs insensitive as it sounds, the coffin and deceased person would be considered cargo and therefore covered by the Montreal Convention, as opposed to EC Regulation 261/2004,\u201d says Coby Benson, a solicitor with the law firm Bott and Co. \u201cThe consignor is entitled to recover damages caused by the delayed receipt of the cargo unless the carrier can prove that it took all reasonable measures to avoid the damage.

Last week, the 160,000 Conservative members who will be making this choice on behalf of the nation received their ballot papers \u2013 some more than one, a farcical error that if left unrectified will undoubtedly call into question the legitimacy of the process. The question they face: Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt? The question the 99.7% of voters who have no say are left with is: beyond Brexit at any cost, what on earth is the modern Conservative party for? As the contest has unfolded, the party has continued its quest to cannibalise itself through Brexit. There may be differences between Hunt and Johnson in terms of demeanour. But in the effort to chase the votes of the tiny, unrepresentative sliver of the electorate that is the Conservative party membership, both men have moved definitively towards sacrificing the two long-standing creeds of British conservatism \u2013 the exercise of fiscal responsibility, and the conservation of the union \u2013 on the altar of a no-deal Brexit.

      "body": "<p>There\u2019s a Caribbean paradise that we all know about: coconut palms; sand soft as white silk; blue seas veiling a coral underworld. And then there\u2019s Dominica. It\u2019s one of the slender necklace of green and mountainous islands \u2013 Guadeloupe, Martinique, St Lucia \u2013 that bewitched the young travel writer Patrick Leigh Fermor when he visited them in the 1950s. Named by Columbus because it was on a Sunday that the mariner spotted the tiny island\u2019s rearing cliffs, Dominica\u2019s enchantment lies in a combination of unspoilt beauty \u2013 hikers adore its hidden lakes, cascading rivers and almost impenetrable forest trails \u2013 and a sense of having stepped back in time.</p> <p>I came to Dominica in search of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/oct/01/tvnews.books\" title=\"\">Jean Rhys</a>, the celebrated Celtic-Creole novelist who was born here in 1890. I fell in love with her childhood Eden from the moment the local aeroplane from Antigua \u2013 no major companies yet fly there direct \u2013 touched down in the majestic shadow of Morne Diablotins. Awaiting me was the island\u2019s most erudite tour guide. Affectionately known as \u201cthe Oracle\u201d, Dr Lennox Honychurch had volunteered to show me the Dominica immortalised in Rhys\u2019s novels.</p> <p>Less Rhys-obsessed visitors can share a taxi for the 90-minute journey from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/douglascharlesairport/\" title=\"\">Douglas-Charles airport</a> to Roseau. I spent a happy two days in the island\u2019s capital at the renovated Charlotte Estate B&amp;B. Set above Roseau\u2019s sparkling bay, this bewitching little hotel offers Creole cooking with a decidedly French twist served on a plantation-style veranda. Far off, you can hear the conch shell horns, announcing the return of the fishing fleet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82071c722acbe98c92422800b7bacef141b449e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82071c722acbe98c92422800b7bacef141b449e8/0_333_6016_3608/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A view down down to Batibou beach on the Atlantic coast of Dominica\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fantasy island \u2026 Batibou beach.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Madge-Wyld/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Roseau is tiny. It took me five minutes to stroll from the hotel up to the town\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.dominicagardens.com/\" title=\"\">Botanic Gardens</a>, created in 1890 in collaboration with Kew. Was it under the gardens\u2019 vast banyan tree \u2013 nowadays a favourite spot for selfies \u2013 that Rhys painfully recalled having been \u201cmentally seduced\u201d by a certain \u201cMr Howard\u201d, an elderly Englishman who fantasised about turning a wide-eyed 14-year-old girl into his sex slave? Or did this strange episode take place in the more formal garden that encloses the clifftop Roseau library? (I knew that this was where Rhys first read <em>Jane Eyre</em>, the book that inspired her best-known novel, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/jul/15/book-beach-wide-sargasso-sea-jean-rhys\" title=\"\">Wide Sargasso Sea</a></em>.)</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hurricane-maria\" title=\"\">Hurricane Maria</a>, which devastated the island in 2017, carried off the library\u2019s roof. Its effects are still visible today, but I found the luxuriant mango tree described in Rhys\u2019s memoir <em>Smile</em><em> Please</em>, still spreading its green canopy above the wooden shell of her parents\u2019 once elegant townhouse on Cork Street. Literary homes aren\u2019t a priority on an island that is still rebuilding entire villages after the hurricane. Rhys\u2019s Roseau home may even have to be demolished.</p> <p>Dominica haunts all of Rhys\u2019s fiction. I wondered whether Roseau\u2019s market would still smell of frangipani, lime juice, cinnamon and cloves? (Yes, although the market has moved location from where slaves were once auctioned, out to the edge of town.) Would I find her remembered world of blue mountains and plunging ravines? A world, she wrote, where \u201ceverything is green, everything is growing\u2026\u201d Reader, I did.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3a5606705bc915daaa23c139df358870102cd59f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a5606705bc915daaa23c139df358870102cd59f/0_221_6633_3980/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Soufri\u00e8re village, ascending up a hillside\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Southern tip \u2026 Soufri\u00e8re village, near Scotts Head, where the \u2018roar of the Atlantic\u2019 meets the \u2018sleepy sigh of the Caribbean\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pointe Baptiste \u2013 the Napier family\u2019s beautiful home and neighbouring cottages \u2013 is hugely popular with visitors, so book ahead. It is a plantation-style house on Dominica\u2019s north coast, which Rhys visited on her sole return to the island in 1936. Lennox and I arrived when the midday sun was glittering off the sea. Author <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/jun/10/patrick-leigh-fermor-obituary\" title=\"\">Patrick Leigh Fermor </a>remembered drinks being served with \u201calmost Babylonian splendour\u201d. I admired the Atlantic view, while savouring a bar of home-produced chocolate. (You can also buy Alan Napier\u2019s chocolate products at Petit Paris, Roseau\u2019s favourite waterside coffee shop.)</p> <p>I knew that the tiny inland estates purchased by Rhys\u2019s father (Amelia and Bona Vista) had long since been swallowed up by rampant vegetation so I asked Lennox to take me to Geneva, where Rhys\u2019s Creole mother grew up. Here, too, we were greeted by a green plateau of tangled vines, enclosed \u2013 as always on this most mountainous of islands \u2013 by the soaring peaks, the names of which Rhys could recite in her sleep. Along the way, Lennox and I talked about Rhys\u2019s writings and the magnetic personality of their creator, a recluse whose works are haunted by the memory of her Caribbean childhood.</p> <p>I learned that the house at Geneva was destroyed in the 1930s. The rusty wheels and crushers of the old sugar mill remain, reminders of an uglier age. Below us nestled Stowe, the modest shoreside house where Rhys\u2019s mother and her twin welcomed Jean\u2019s seafaring father to his first medical practice on the island. \u201cStowe hasn\u2019t changed at all,\u201d Lennox proudly told me \u2013 and I began to understand that Dominica\u2019s landscapes could teach me more about Rhys than her vanishing homes ever could.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ef40e272595c455f21373eee82b5e73f921a3f23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef40e272595c455f21373eee82b5e73f921a3f23/0_313_5595_3357/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The colourful Soufri\u00e8re church in Dominica, with green hillside and blue sky behind\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Step back in time \u2026 Soufri\u00e8re church.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back at Roseau, I visited the travel desk at the town\u2019s largest hotel, <a href=\"https://www.hotelsone.com/roseau-hotels-dm/fort-young-hotel.html?as=g&amp;aid=8495685398&amp;dsti=223116&amp;dstt=8&amp;akw=fort%20young%20hotel%20roseau&amp;asrc=Search&amp;ast=&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6unMksiE4wIVR4XVCh1eCQ95EAAYAiAAEgK8ffD_BwE\" title=\"\">Fort Young</a>. Shane, who works for Ken\u2019s Hinterland Adventure Tours, drove me south along the coast to Scotts Head. There, standing on a narrow isthmus of sand and pebbles, I\u2019d been told that I would hear precisely where the Atlantic\u2019s roar, thundering down from a sea of white breakers, meets the Caribbean\u2019s sleepy sigh. Twist left to hear the sigh; twist right, for the roar. Shane, used to showing off Dominica\u2019s twin-sea miracle, smiled at my excitement.</p> <p>A few final treats still lay ahead. Deep in the Roseau valley, at the foot of the majestic Trafalgar Falls, were the gardens of <a href=\"http://caribya.com/dominica/papilote.wild.retreat/\" title=\"\">Papillote</a>. Nearby, <a href=\"https://discoverdominica.com/en/places/79/wotten-waven-hot-springs\" title=\"\">Wotten Waven</a> offered outdoor sulphur springs, mud baths and inexpensive hospitality at the friendly <a href=\"https://discoverdominica.com/en/places/44/le-petit-paris-bakery-restaurant\" title=\"\">Petit </a><a href=\"https://discoverdominica.com/en/places/44/le-petit-paris-bakery-restaurant\" title=\"\">Paris</a> (perfect for another delicious creole lunch). Heading north again, I took a leisurely trip down Indian River (<em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> territory) before spending a night at the island\u2019s most imaginative resort. The spacious verandas of <a href=\"https://secretbay.dm/\" title=\"\">Secret Bay\u2019s</a> spacious guano-wood \u201ctree-houses\u201d offer panoramic views of Dominica\u2019s smouldering sunsets and mountain-vaulting rainbows.

I fell in love with her childhood Eden from the moment the local aeroplane from Antigua \u2013 no major companies yet fly there direct \u2013 touched down in the majestic shadow of Morne Diablotins. Awaiting me was the island\u2019s most erudite tour guide. Affectionately known as \u201cthe Oracle\u201d, Dr Lennox Honychurch had volunteered to show me the Dominica immortalised in Rhys\u2019s novels. Less Rhys-obsessed visitors can share a taxi for the 90-minute journey from Douglas-Charles airport to Roseau. I spent a happy two days in the island\u2019s capital at the renovated Charlotte Estate B&amp;B. Set above Roseau\u2019s sparkling bay, this bewitching little hotel offers Creole cooking with a decidedly French twist served on a plantation-style veranda. Far off, you can hear the conch shell horns, announcing the return of the fishing fleet. Roseau is tiny. It took me five minutes to stroll from the hotel up to the town\u2019s Botanic Gardens, created in 1890 in collaboration with Kew. Was it under the gardens\u2019 vast banyan tree \u2013 nowadays a favourite spot for selfies \u2013 that Rhys painfully recalled having been \u201cmentally seduced\u201d by a certain \u201cMr Howard\u201d, an elderly Englishman who fantasised about turning a wide-eyed 14-year-old girl into his sex slave? Or did this strange episode take place in the more formal garden that encloses the clifftop Roseau library? (I knew that this was where Rhys first read Jane Eyre, the book that inspired her best-known novel, Wide Sargasso Sea.) Hurricane Maria, which devastated the island in 2017, carried off the library\u2019s roof. Its effects are still visible today, but I found the luxuriant mango tree described in Rhys\u2019s memoir Smile Please, still spreading its green canopy above the wooden shell of her parents\u2019 once elegant townhouse on Cork Street. Literary homes aren\u2019t a priority on an island that is still rebuilding entire villages after the hurricane. Rhys\u2019s Roseau home may even have to be demolished. Dominica haunts all of Rhys\u2019s fiction. I wondered whether Roseau\u2019s market would still smell of frangipani, lime juice, cinnamon and cloves? (Yes, although the market has moved location from where slaves were once auctioned, out to the edge of town.) Would I find her remembered world of blue mountains and plunging ravines? A world, she wrote, where \u201ceverything is green, everything is growing\u2026\u201d Reader, I did. Pointe Baptiste \u2013 the Napier family\u2019s beautiful home and neighbouring cottages \u2013 is hugely popular with visitors, so book ahead. It is a plantation-style house on Dominica\u2019s north coast, which Rhys visited on her sole return to the island in 1936. Lennox and I arrived when the midday sun was glittering off the sea. Author Patrick Leigh Fermor remembered drinks being served with \u201calmost Babylonian splendour\u201d. I admired the Atlantic view, while savouring a bar of home-produced chocolate. (You can also buy Alan Napier\u2019s chocolate products at Petit Paris, Roseau\u2019s favourite waterside coffee shop.) I knew that the tiny inland estates purchased by Rhys\u2019s father (Amelia and Bona Vista) had long since been swallowed up by rampant vegetation so I asked Lennox to take me to Geneva, where Rhys\u2019s Creole mother grew up. Here, too, we were greeted by a green plateau of tangled vines, enclosed \u2013 as always on this most mountainous of islands \u2013 by the soaring peaks, the names of which Rhys could recite in her sleep. Along the way, Lennox and I talked about Rhys\u2019s writings and the magnetic personality of their creator, a recluse whose works are haunted by the memory of her Caribbean childhood. I learned that the house at Geneva was destroyed in the 1930s. The rusty wheels and crushers of the old sugar mill remain, reminders of an uglier age. Below us nestled Stowe, the modest shoreside house where Rhys\u2019s mother and her twin welcomed Jean\u2019s seafaring father to his first medical practice on the island. \u201cStowe hasn\u2019t changed at all,\u201d Lennox proudly told me \u2013 and I began to understand that Dominica\u2019s landscapes could teach me more about Rhys than her vanishing homes ever could. Back at Roseau, I visited the travel desk at the town\u2019s largest hotel, Fort Young. Shane, who works for Ken\u2019s Hinterland Adventure Tours, drove me south along the coast to Scotts Head. There, standing on a narrow isthmus of sand and pebbles, I\u2019d been told that I would hear precisely where the Atlantic\u2019s roar, thundering down from a sea of white breakers, meets the Caribbean\u2019s sleepy sigh. Twist left to hear the sigh; twist right, for the roar. Shane, used to showing off Dominica\u2019s twin-sea miracle, smiled at my excitement. A few final treats still lay ahead. Deep in the Roseau valley, at the foot of the majestic Trafalgar Falls, were the gardens of Papillote. Nearby, Wotten Waven offered outdoor sulphur springs, mud baths and inexpensive hospitality at the friendly Petit Paris (perfect for another delicious creole lunch). Heading north again, I took a leisurely trip down Indian River (Pirates of the Caribbean territory) before spending a night at the island\u2019s most imaginative resort. The spacious verandas of Secret Bay\u2019s spacious guano-wood \u201ctree-houses\u201d offer panoramic views of Dominica\u2019s smouldering sunsets and mountain-vaulting rainbows. How could Rhys ever forget an island of such unparalleled beauty? I knew I never would. Way to go British Airways flies regularly from Gatwick to Antigua (\u00a3410 return) or Barbados (from \u00a3414 return); LIAT daily local flights connect to Douglas-Charles airport. Charlotte Estate B&amp;B has rooms from \u00a3105. Pointe Baptiste has four rooms and costs \u00a3210 a night.

A glance at the current schedule shows a station treading water. We\u2019ve had the same programmes at the same times for years now, and though each is individually strong, such stasis means that there is no ooh-what\u2019s-<em>this</em>? refreshment, no reach for a new audience, no excitement for a changing future. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jan/21/bbc-radio-4-controller-gwyneth-williams-announces-departure\" title=\"\">Gwyneth Williams</a>, the last controller, did very little in her eight years at the helm, other than bringing in <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b015sqc7\" title=\"\">The Life Scientific</a></em> and the excellent <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00nrtd2/episodes/downloads\" title=\"\">A History of the World in 100 Objects</a></em>. I love Radio 4 but find myself flicking to other stations and podcasts very frequently. It often seems to be broadcasting from another age.</p> <p>Also, given that Williams announced her resignation in January, you might have thought that a new head would be installed by now. But no. Change takes so long at the Beeb. According to <em>Private Eye</em>, interviews were done months ago, with the four final candidates \u2013 Mohit Bakaya (currently commissioning editor for factual), Joanna Carr (head of current affairs) and Robert Ketteridge (production executive), all Radio 4 veterans, plus Cassian Harrison, head of BBC Four \u2013 but a decision is not forthcoming. In fact, the BBC refuses to confirm that these are the final four. There is speculation<em> </em>that this is because the corporation is constantly worried about how its choice will be viewed. There\u2019s also a hint that BBC top boss Tony Hall doesn\u2019t like making tricky decisions. The <em>Eye </em>thinks we may have to wait until 22 July, the day the ballot closes in the Tory leadership election: my BBC contacts reckon it will be announced before then.</p> <p>In the meantime, shall we all have a think as to what we want from Radio 4? And then, when the new controller is finally announced, we can present them with our ideas en masse. Bear in mind, of course, that any ideas will have to go through Radio 4\u2019s interminable commissioning process; but with any luck, we might have a fresh-sounding station by, oooh, 2025.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6ebfe649ae86ff9d93adcabea7177bf73b79cb69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ebfe649ae86ff9d93adcabea7177bf73b79cb69/0_0_1840_2300/800.jpg\" alt=\"Frank Kameny, picketing\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Waspish, dramatic, angry\u2019: Frank Kameny, interviewed in Making Gay History.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PBS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Outside Radio 4, I\u2019ve been very much enjoying the special Stonewall episodes of US podcast <strong><a href=\"https://makinggayhistory.com/\" title=\"\">Making Gay History</a></strong>. (The Stonewall riots were spontaneous, violent protests by members of the NYC gay community against the police, after a raid.) <em>Making Gay History</em>, in general, brings queer history to life through archival and present-day interviews with LGBT people. It\u2019s a brilliant endeavour, and I wish we had something similar in the UK.</p> <p>It\u2019s 50 years since the Stonewall riots (28 June 1969). As presenter Eric Marcus makes clear, gay rights did not begin with Stonewall, though it was an important event on the way.

I could not love Kameny more.</p> <p>The series continues through the 60s and into the era and events that spawned the riots.

      "bodyText": "Radio 4 Making Gay History: the podcast What is happening with Radio 4? A glance at the current schedule shows a station treading water. We\u2019ve had the same programmes at the same times for years now, and though each is individually strong, such stasis means that there is no ooh-what\u2019s-this? refreshment, no reach for a new audience, no excitement for a changing future. Gwyneth Williams, the last controller, did very little in her eight years at the helm, other than bringing in The Life Scientific and the excellent A History of the World in 100 Objects. I love Radio 4 but find myself flicking to other stations and podcasts very frequently. It often seems to be broadcasting from another age. Also, given that Williams announced her resignation in January, you might have thought that a new head would be installed by now. But no. Change takes so long at the Beeb. According to Private Eye, interviews were done months ago, with the four final candidates \u2013 Mohit Bakaya (currently commissioning editor for factual), Joanna Carr (head of current affairs) and Robert Ketteridge (production executive), all Radio 4 veterans, plus Cassian Harrison, head of BBC Four \u2013 but a decision is not forthcoming. In fact, the BBC refuses to confirm that these are the final four. There is speculation that this is because the corporation is constantly worried about how its choice will be viewed. There\u2019s also a hint that BBC top boss Tony Hall doesn\u2019t like making tricky decisions. The Eye thinks we may have to wait until 22 July, the day the ballot closes in the Tory leadership election: my BBC contacts reckon it will be announced before then. In the meantime, shall we all have a think as to what we want from Radio 4? And then, when the new controller is finally announced, we can present them with our ideas en masse. Bear in mind, of course, that any ideas will have to go through Radio 4\u2019s interminable commissioning process; but with any luck, we might have a fresh-sounding station by, oooh, 2025. Outside Radio 4, I\u2019ve been very much enjoying the special Stonewall episodes of US podcast Making Gay History. (The Stonewall riots were spontaneous, violent protests by members of the NYC gay community against the police, after a raid.) Making Gay History, in general, brings queer history to life through archival and present-day interviews with LGBT people. It\u2019s a brilliant endeavour, and I wish we had something similar in the UK. It\u2019s 50 years since the Stonewall riots (28 June 1969). As presenter Eric Marcus makes clear, gay rights did not begin with Stonewall, though it was an important event on the way. He opens the series by looking at earlier gay activism, beginning with an interview with Frank Kameny, who was sacked from his Washington government job in the 1950s for being gay. Marcus did the interview in 1989, when Kameny was in his 60s. And, crikey, Kameny is fantastic value for money: waspish, dramatic, angry. When asked how many people were involved in US gay rights in the 1950s he says: \u201cA person or two\u2026 You could count them on one hand!\u2026 The movement of those days was a very unassertive, apologetic, defensive kind of structure. Not taking strong positions\u2026 saying all views must be heard, even those which are the most harshly and viciously condemnatory\u2026 drivel! There was absolutely nothing whatsoever which anybody heard at any time anywhere at all which was other than negative! Nothing!\u201d (I have cut him down a lot; the whole speech is fantastic.) I could not love Kameny more. The series continues through the 60s and into the era and events that spawned the riots.

      "bodyText": "The Dragonfly As announced last month, Nasa is sending a drone named the Dragonfly to explore Saturn\u2019s largest moon, Titan. Part of their New Frontiers programme to explore the solar system\u2019s biochemical relationships, the Dragonfly is scheduled to launch in 2026 and arrive at the icy moon in 2034. Development costs have peaked at $850m. Titan has \u201call the ingredients for life\u201d, says Lori Glaze, director of Nasa\u2019s planetary science division. Lucy Scheduled to launch in 2021, Lucy will carry out the first exploration of a body of primitive asteroids known as Trojans, which orbit the sun with Jupiter. Trojans are a residue of the primordial material that created the outer planets, meaning they hold clues to the history of the solar system. Using a remote-sensing instrument, Lucy will be able to assess the unique differences between the Trojans and collate information on the origins and evolution of the whole solar system. Lucy should reach the first Trojan asteroids in 2027. Osiris-Rex Launched in September 2016 and set to return to Earth in 2023, Osiris-Rex will be the first US mission to bring back samples of asteroid dust to Earth. Standing for Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer, the probe is currently orbiting the asteroid Bennu and choosing a sample selection site for next summer. Juno Launched in August 2011 and with a now projected ending of July 2021, Juno is looking at the origins and evolution of Jupiter as a gas giant, which will aid understanding of other planetary systems that surround various stars. It recently sent back data detailing Jupiter\u2019s changing internal magnetic field. New Horizons Four billion miles from Earth, New Horizons aims to aid our understanding of the icy planets on the periphery of our solar system. In 2015 it sent back detailed images of Pluto and earlier this year it beamed back images of a snowman-shaped object in the Kuiper belt named Ultima Thule. The probe is continuing to make observations of other Kuiper belt objects. It\u2019s fuel reserves should last until the 2030s.",

Not content with now having Glastonbury in the palm of his hand, he reminded us last week by default of how, in a parallel universe, it could all have been done so very wrongly over the past 50 years.</p> <p>Not that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0006hm8\" title=\"\"><strong>Serengeti</strong></a><strong> </strong>was <em>bad</em>, exactly. Not exactly. But we have become so used to his fair-mindedness, and the (generally) nonjudgmental non-interference of the BBC\u2019s wildlife units, that it was something of a shock to find this on BBC One: I kept waiting for the ITV, or even ITV2, logo, and ad breaks. It\u2019s big budget and filmed with some gauzy splendour in the Serengeti, but crucially bills itself as a \u201cbold new dramatised natural-history format\u201d. Basically this would seem to mean taking the lives of a few charismatic animals, giving them (human) Bantu names and having poor John Boyega voice \u201ctheir\u201d thoughts. Series director John Downer, the man behind the slightly gimmicky <em>Spy in the Wild</em>, has, tellingly, written \u201cno animals were created using CGI but occasionally compositing techniques, which combine real footage, have been used to help the narrative and the dramatic flow of scenes\u201d. It\u2019s meant to be a family drama, then, a big soap, telling of the lives and loves and even ambitions of a lioness and her cubs, a truculent teenage elephant, a cutesy, er, hyena, and as such does a reasonably honest job, thrillingly close-shot, of lovelorn baboon Bakari and Tembo and Zalika and the rest, trying to find a way to manage life\u2019s social travails when it is, actually, a jungle out there.</p> <p>But, oh, that voiceover storyline. Boyega pretends he\u2019s one of them so begins almost every section with \u201cin our world\u201d and goes on to (not John\u2019s fault surely, but that of the script) come close to anthropomorphising them, or at least their thoughts. \u201cIt is, he knows, fraught with danger. But danger brings courage.\u201d Or, worse: \u201cFor all of us, embracing our destiny can be the hardest challenge of all.\u201d When you analyse that, what does it even <em>mean</em>? Could it be in fact better suited to the bedroom wall of an adolescent child than the mindset of a Serengeti vulture?</p> <p>Worse, far worse, is the sub-<em>Lion King</em> \u201cmusic\u201d throughout. At one stage, following the red-rough death of a mother, a wee daughter hyena was followed in her confused mourning with the lyrics \u201cI must be strong \u2026 something de dum \u2026 wisdom passed on unto the grave \u2026\u201d being dripped out by Lola Lennox.

      "bodyText": "Serengeti (BBC One) | iPlayer The River: A Year in the Life of the Tay (BBC Four) | iPlayer Stranger Things | Netflix Killing Eve (BBC One) | iPlayer Attenborough has rather spoilt us, has he not? Not content with now having Glastonbury in the palm of his hand, he reminded us last week by default of how, in a parallel universe, it could all have been done so very wrongly over the past 50 years. Not that Serengeti was bad, exactly. Not exactly. But we have become so used to his fair-mindedness, and the (generally) nonjudgmental non-interference of the BBC\u2019s wildlife units, that it was something of a shock to find this on BBC One: I kept waiting for the ITV, or even ITV2, logo, and ad breaks. It\u2019s big budget and filmed with some gauzy splendour in the Serengeti, but crucially bills itself as a \u201cbold new dramatised natural-history format\u201d. Basically this would seem to mean taking the lives of a few charismatic animals, giving them (human) Bantu names and having poor John Boyega voice \u201ctheir\u201d thoughts. Series director John Downer, the man behind the slightly gimmicky Spy in the Wild, has, tellingly, written \u201cno animals were created using CGI but occasionally compositing techniques, which combine real footage, have been used to help the narrative and the dramatic flow of scenes\u201d. It\u2019s meant to be a family drama, then, a big soap, telling of the lives and loves and even ambitions of a lioness and her cubs, a truculent teenage elephant, a cutesy, er, hyena, and as such does a reasonably honest job, thrillingly close-shot, of lovelorn baboon Bakari and Tembo and Zalika and the rest, trying to find a way to manage life\u2019s social travails when it is, actually, a jungle out there. But, oh, that voiceover storyline. Boyega pretends he\u2019s one of them so begins almost every section with \u201cin our world\u201d and goes on to (not John\u2019s fault surely, but that of the script) come close to anthropomorphising them, or at least their thoughts. \u201cIt is, he knows, fraught with danger. But danger brings courage.\u201d Or, worse: \u201cFor all of us, embracing our destiny can be the hardest challenge of all.\u201d When you analyse that, what does it even mean? Could it be in fact better suited to the bedroom wall of an adolescent child than the mindset of a Serengeti vulture? Worse, far worse, is the sub-Lion King \u201cmusic\u201d throughout. At one stage, following the red-rough death of a mother, a wee daughter hyena was followed in her confused mourning with the lyrics \u201cI must be strong \u2026 something de dum \u2026 wisdom passed on unto the grave \u2026\u201d being dripped out by Lola Lennox. It\u2019s co-produced by Simon Fuller, of Pop Idol franchise fame, which must tell us something. The BBC must quietly be preparing for the day when Attenborough can\u2019t play Glasto any more. I fervently hope this isn\u2019t the way forward, although it has given me a useful new distinction between \u201cpopular\u201d and \u201cpopulist\u201d. No, if you wanted an honest, fascinating, searingly well-written natural voyage you had to content yourself last week with The River: A Year in the Life of the Tay, an absolute gem of a programme fronted with wisdom and infectious enthusiasm by Helen Macdonald, author of the lovely H Is for Hawk.

The chain had been expected to release the results last week but had to delay them: probably the least eventful thing to have happened to the company in the last few months. In April, Dunkerton, the company\u2019s biggest shareholder, won a six-month battle to rejoin it, prompting the entire board to resign \u2013 including the chief executive, Euan Sutherland. The following month, the fashion label issued its third profit warning in eight months, saying it would miss City forecasts for a pre-tax profit of \u00a354.1m to \u00a359.4m for the year to 27 April. And last week it announced it was appointing two experienced figures to the board \u2013 the former Marks &amp; Spencer finance head Helen Weir and the ex-New Look finance chief Alastair Miller. Meanwhile, the announcement of the full-year results was postponed from 4 July to Wednesday of this week after the company said its auditors needed more time following a review of its stores. So it has been a tumultuous period, to say the least, at the brand that shot to prominence when David Beckham wore one of its \u201cOsaka 6\u201d logo T-shirts on the cover of his 2005 calendar. The company was created by Dunkerton and the designer James Holder in Cheltenham in 2003. Having handed over the role of chief executive to Sutherland in 2014, Dunkerton remained with Superdry and latterly held the part-time role of \u201cfounder and product brand director\u201d. However, he quit in March last year after disagreeing with Sutherland\u2019s revamp of the business, which then led to a collapse in sales and a string of profit warnings. With characteristic aplomb, Dunkerton said he was \u201cprobably the most experienced human being in this industry in this country as we know it\u201d when he criticised the direction the company had been taking. Following his six-month campaign, he was reinstated at the head of the company and started to ramp up the number of products from its range that are sold online and sought to re-establish its \u201cstrong brand identity\u201d. More stock was put on the shop floor at its flagship stores, including in Regent Street, London, and promotions were cut back to improve profit margins.

      "body": "<p>Amazon\u2019s boss, Jeff Bezos, makes an easy target for anti-poverty campaigners. He runs a near-trillion-dollar company that pays very little tax. He is personally worth $160bn and makes few charitable donations.</p> <p>So there will be plenty of sympathy across the political spectrum for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/05/jeremy-corbyn-wishes-amazon-many-happy-tax-returns-on-its-25th-anniversary\" title=\"\">Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s letter to Bezos</a> wishing him and his company, which is celebrating its 25th anniversary, \u201cmany happy tax returns\u201d.</p> <p>Amazon UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/amazon-halved-uk-corporation-tax-bill-to-45m-last-year\" title=\"\">paid only \u00a31.7m in corporation tax in 2017</a>, despite its pre-tax profits tripling to \u00a372m. Quite how the company\u2019s profitability is this low when turnover in Britain for 2017 rose 35%, from \u00a31.46bn to \u00a31.98bn, is beyond most people\u2019s comprehension.</p> <p>Unions also complain that Amazon ranks among the worst employers. Not so much for its pay scales, which start above the real living wage of \u00a39 an hour as determined by the Living Wage Foundation; instead unions are angry at their members working long shifts in warehouses, under pressure to hit targets for the number of items they pick each day, which they say is causing pain and injuries. Amazon insists it offers a safe, modern working environment.</p> <p>Bezos might have gained more sympathy if he had joined Giving Pledge, the US charity that asks the richest people in the world to hand over 50% of their wealth. His ex-wife, MacKenzie Bezos, has joined, adding her $38bn divorce settlement to the scheme. Bill Gates and his wife, Melinda, are members and Warren Buffett, the renowned investor worth $88bn, has signed up.</p> <p>Bezos has taken his own path. But it is one that fails the philosopher Peter Singer\u2019s test of philanthropy, which asks if the donation leaves the donor with just enough for a decent life, is supporting the poorest and does so in a way that helps the most people possible.</p> <p>Among many relatively small donations, he gave $1m in 2016 to a not-for-profit homeless shelter in Seattle. In January 2018 he went further and gave $33m to a not-for-profit organisation that funds college scholarships for immigrants. In September last year he finally entered the major league, giving $2bn to the Bezos Day One Fund, launched to support education programmes for homeless families.</p> <p>Amazon\u2019s tax bill has stayed low over two decades as the company funded its expansion. One project that will be written off against tax is a fibreoptic cable stretching from the US to Africa: Bezos and Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg are engaged in a race to beat Google to wire up a continent that the United Nations says will see the largest population growth on the planet over the next 30 years.</p> <p>That might seem altruistic, but the cabling of an entire continent would be much better funded by African taxpayers, with the help of western taxpayers, and without strings attached. Unfortunately, as long as the tech giants manoeuvre to limit their tax liabilities there is not enough cash for public investment.</p> <p>Philip Hammond has said that he will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/29/hammond-targets-us-tech-giants-with-digital-services-tax\" title=\"\">introduce a new tax on the digital giants</a> \u2013 including Google, Facebook and Amazon \u2013 from April next year to increase the amount they pay in the UK.</p> <p>The chancellor says the Treasury will apply a 2% tax on revenue from search engines, social media platforms and online marketplaces, and that this tax will be levied against technology firms that make more than \u00a3500m a year globally.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/29/hammond-targets-us-tech-giants-with-digital-services-tax\" title=\"\">The tax is expected to raise just \u00a330m</a> from each company.

Yet JLR\u2019s news came only a day after new car sales figures showed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/04/subsidy-cuts-blamed-for-fall-in-uk-sales-of-electrified-vehicles\" title=\"\">a reverse in the uptake of alternatively fuelled vehicles</a> year-on-year in June. Although pure electric car sales rose, those of plug-in hybrids halved. The cause is not hard to spot: the sudden abolition of the \u00a32,500 hybrid subsidy last October, by the very government that trumpets its supposed ambitions for carbon reduction.</p> <p>Although zero-emission cars are the ultimate goal, credible independent experts argue that hybrids are an important step, at least until the manufacturing capacity and the infrastructure to meet demand for fully electric cars are in place.</p> <p>The black-cab drivers who have snapped up London\u2019s new electric taxi now face a sizeable stick as well as a tempting carrot \u2013 and that vehicle remains essentially a hybrid, with a petrol-engine backup to reassure those venturing south of the River Thames.</p> <p>Little wonder JLR agonised so long over its \u00a31bn investment decision, which it believes can only pay off if Britain develops a battery supply capability to match. The government\u2019s financial support for battery R&amp;D fits its environmental strategy as much as its industrial strategy, but it is easy to imagine both being undermined: Greg Clark, the business secretary who stands sombrely in attendance while the car industry declines, will know that far more jobs than JLR can provide will vanish in a no-deal Brexit.</p> <h2>Yes, bookies are closing: but don\u2019t blame curbs on FOBTs</h2> <p>Bookmakers predicted that state-imposed curbs on \u00a3100-a-spin fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) would trigger shop closures and job losses. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/04/william-hill-may-axe-700-shops-as-fobt-reform-bites\" title=\"\">So it has proved.</a> William Hill has confirmed 700 shops are earmarked for closure, threatening 4,500 jobs. Ladbrokes Coral\u2019s owner, GVC, has drawn up similar plans, as has Betfred.</p> <p>The industry may not have been lying when it forecast a bonfire of the bookies, but it was exaggerating. A report submitted to the Treasury, but kept secret from the public, indicated the industry could shed 21,000 jobs, with more than 4,000 shops closing. In reality, the total is looking more like half that.</p> <p>Nor should gambling firms be allowed to blame retrenchment wholly on FOBT restrictions, at least not without some counterpoint. Revenues from the high street have been in long-term decline, while income from online operations is surging. Major betting firms\u2019 web operations are cannibalising the custom on which their bricks-and-mortar networks rely. Some of those shops were on life support as a result, kept going only by the shot in the arm provided by FOBTs.</p> <p>The flip side of that cosy arrangement was a roster of desperate addicts for whom the machines seemed to hold an inescapable allure. Thousands of pounds could be lost by customers in just a few hours \u2013 and frequently was.

      "bodyText": "Amazon\u2019s boss, Jeff Bezos, makes an easy target for anti-poverty campaigners. He runs a near-trillion-dollar company that pays very little tax. He is personally worth $160bn and makes few charitable donations. So there will be plenty of sympathy across the political spectrum for Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s letter to Bezos wishing him and his company, which is celebrating its 25th anniversary, \u201cmany happy tax returns\u201d. Amazon UK paid only \u00a31.7m in corporation tax in 2017, despite its pre-tax profits tripling to \u00a372m. Quite how the company\u2019s profitability is this low when turnover in Britain for 2017 rose 35%, from \u00a31.46bn to \u00a31.98bn, is beyond most people\u2019s comprehension. Unions also complain that Amazon ranks among the worst employers. Not so much for its pay scales, which start above the real living wage of \u00a39 an hour as determined by the Living Wage Foundation; instead unions are angry at their members working long shifts in warehouses, under pressure to hit targets for the number of items they pick each day, which they say is causing pain and injuries. Amazon insists it offers a safe, modern working environment. Bezos might have gained more sympathy if he had joined Giving Pledge, the US charity that asks the richest people in the world to hand over 50% of their wealth. His ex-wife, MacKenzie Bezos, has joined, adding her $38bn divorce settlement to the scheme. Bill Gates and his wife, Melinda, are members and Warren Buffett, the renowned investor worth $88bn, has signed up. Bezos has taken his own path. But it is one that fails the philosopher Peter Singer\u2019s test of philanthropy, which asks if the donation leaves the donor with just enough for a decent life, is supporting the poorest and does so in a way that helps the most people possible. Among many relatively small donations, he gave $1m in 2016 to a not-for-profit homeless shelter in Seattle. In January 2018 he went further and gave $33m to a not-for-profit organisation that funds college scholarships for immigrants. In September last year he finally entered the major league, giving $2bn to the Bezos Day One Fund, launched to support education programmes for homeless families. Amazon\u2019s tax bill has stayed low over two decades as the company funded its expansion. One project that will be written off against tax is a fibreoptic cable stretching from the US to Africa: Bezos and Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg are engaged in a race to beat Google to wire up a continent that the United Nations says will see the largest population growth on the planet over the next 30 years. That might seem altruistic, but the cabling of an entire continent would be much better funded by African taxpayers, with the help of western taxpayers, and without strings attached. Unfortunately, as long as the tech giants manoeuvre to limit their tax liabilities there is not enough cash for public investment. Philip Hammond has said that he will introduce a new tax on the digital giants \u2013 including Google, Facebook and Amazon \u2013 from April next year to increase the amount they pay in the UK. The chancellor says the Treasury will apply a 2% tax on revenue from search engines, social media platforms and online marketplaces, and that this tax will be levied against technology firms that make more than \u00a3500m a year globally. The tax is expected to raise just \u00a330m from each company. It should be more. Bezos and Amazon should be made to cough up. Unplugging the hybrid subsidy was sure to harm sales Jaguar Land Rover has finally bitten the bullet and decided that its electric future may \u2013 at least in part \u2013 belong in Britain. Its West Midlands plant will be refitted to produce the next generation of hybrid and electric models: rare relief in an industry whose outlook in Britain has been bleak since the June 2016 referendum. The commitment from Britain\u2019s biggest car manufacturer to greener alternatives is welcome. Yet JLR\u2019s news came only a day after new car sales figures showed a reverse in the uptake of alternatively fuelled vehicles year-on-year in June. Although pure electric car sales rose, those of plug-in hybrids halved. The cause is not hard to spot: the sudden abolition of the \u00a32,500 hybrid subsidy last October, by the very government that trumpets its supposed ambitions for carbon reduction. Although zero-emission cars are the ultimate goal, credible independent experts argue that hybrids are an important step, at least until the manufacturing capacity and the infrastructure to meet demand for fully electric cars are in place. The black-cab drivers who have snapped up London\u2019s new electric taxi now face a sizeable stick as well as a tempting carrot \u2013 and that vehicle remains essentially a hybrid, with a petrol-engine backup to reassure those venturing south of the River Thames. Little wonder JLR agonised so long over its \u00a31bn investment decision, which it believes can only pay off if Britain develops a battery supply capability to match. The government\u2019s financial support for battery R&amp;D fits its environmental strategy as much as its industrial strategy, but it is easy to imagine both being undermined: Greg Clark, the business secretary who stands sombrely in attendance while the car industry declines, will know that far more jobs than JLR can provide will vanish in a no-deal Brexit. Yes, bookies are closing: but don\u2019t blame curbs on FOBTs Bookmakers predicted that state-imposed curbs on \u00a3100-a-spin fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) would trigger shop closures and job losses. So it has proved. William Hill has confirmed 700 shops are earmarked for closure, threatening 4,500 jobs. Ladbrokes Coral\u2019s owner, GVC, has drawn up similar plans, as has Betfred. The industry may not have been lying when it forecast a bonfire of the bookies, but it was exaggerating. A report submitted to the Treasury, but kept secret from the public, indicated the industry could shed 21,000 jobs, with more than 4,000 shops closing. In reality, the total is looking more like half that. Nor should gambling firms be allowed to blame retrenchment wholly on FOBT restrictions, at least not without some counterpoint. Revenues from the high street have been in long-term decline, while income from online operations is surging. Major betting firms\u2019 web operations are cannibalising the custom on which their bricks-and-mortar networks rely. Some of those shops were on life support as a result, kept going only by the shot in the arm provided by FOBTs. The flip side of that cosy arrangement was a roster of desperate addicts for whom the machines seemed to hold an inescapable allure. Thousands of pounds could be lost by customers in just a few hours \u2013 and frequently was. The government eventually resolved that it was better to dispense with the machines altogether, at the risk of harming the gambling industry, than allow them to continue, at the risk of harming the public. Rules that allowed four FOBTs per shop had also encouraged bookmakers to open multiple premises in order to squeeze as many machines as possible into a small area. In many cases, these were in low-income neighbourhoods where punters could ill afford big losses. Now the crunch has come and bookies are paying the price for that overexpansion. They will blame anyone but themselves.",

      "body": "<p>Father Ignatius Harrison opens a wardrobe door to reveal a rack of scarlet cardinal\u2019s robes. \u201cThese have been here for more than 100 years,\u201d he says. \u201cThis was his dressing chamber.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201che\u201d in question is John Henry Newman who, following <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-48827552\" title=\"\">an announcement from the Vatican</a> last week, is about to become the only English person born after the 17th century to be declared a Roman Catholic saint.</p> <p>The robes, along with most of Newman\u2019s belongings, were left in his private quarters at the Birmingham Oratory after he died in 1890. Now the preparations for his canonisation are well under way, excitement among his devotees is building and the trickle of pilgrims who already come to venerate Newman is about to turn into a flood. As a result, the robes are to be put on display in a new museum at the oratory.</p> <p>\u201cThe conservationists say they need to be kept in climate-controlled cabinets,\u201d says Harrison, the provost of the oratory. The museum, which will include digitisations of 20,000 Newman manuscripts, is due to open after Pope Francis declares Newman a saint on 13 October in St Peter\u2019s Square at the Vatican. The provost looks momentarily downcast. \u201cApparently it will cost \u00a375,000, so we will need some help.\u201d</p> <p>Newman was perhaps the most influential and controversial English theologian of the 19th century. He became an evangelical, and determinedly protestant, Church of England priest as a young man, but converted to Catholicism aged 44, convinced that Anglicanism was more closely related to Rome than his peers believed.</p> <p>\u201cThe Anglicans thought he was a traitor and a lot of Catholics thought he was a dangerous liberal,\u201d Harrison says. \u201cBeing made a cardinal by Pope Leo XIII was the acceptance that he was sound, solid.\u201d</p> <p>Newman went on to found the Birmingham Oratory, a society of priests, and the school associated with it, and became the first rector of University College Dublin. During his funeral procession in Birmingham, 15,000 people lined the streets.</p> <p>Next door to the dressing room \u2013 now used as Harrison\u2019s office \u2013 is Newman\u2019s study and private chapel, which has also been left exactly as it was after Newman\u2019s death: a chair with a cracked leather seat sits at his desk, on which stand scales for weighing his letters before posting, and a pair of oval spectacles on a bookshelf. \u201cThey say the wallpaper was yellow when it was first put up,\u201d Harrison says. The wall is now a muddy green and would probably not withstand the attentions of a host of pilgrims, so the study will be filmed and displayed on video in the museum.</p> <p>Pilgrims will be able to view the chapel that holds Newman\u2019s remains: a lock of hair and a fragment of bone, in a casket decorated with the brass handles from his coffin. \u201cSince the pope announced the date of the canonisation, I\u2019ve been flooded with requests for small groups to come here,\u201d Harrison says.</p> <p>The making of pilgrimages is growing in Britain and abroad. The Camino de Santiago in Spain, F\u00e1tima in Portugal, the Kumbh Mela in India and the Hajj attract millions of people. In Britain, more than seven million overseas visitors go to at least one religious site, according to the tourism trade body UKinbound, and about 250,000 people visit <a href=\"https://www.walsinghamvillage.org/about/history-of-pilgrimage/\" title=\"\">Walsingham in Norfolk</a>, which has been a site of pilgrimage since 1061, when the lady of the manor said she had a vision of the Virgin Mary.</p> <p>Organisations such as the British Pilgrimage Trust are springing up to cater for their needs. The BPT\u2019s founder, Guy Hayward, believes the growth in pilgrimages \u2013 by secular pilgrims as well as religious \u2013 is an expression of a rejection of rationalism. \u201cI think we\u2019re now moving into a kind of age of experience where people get their knowledge in a different way,\u201d Hayward says, citing the array of online information about faiths. \u201cPeople want to be unified more, connect with the earth, get in touch with their feelings, the community. And pilgrimage does all of that.\u201d</p> <p>Despite Newman\u2019s rejection of the Church of England, many Anglicans still honour him. One, the Rev Dr Hugh White, created a Newman pilgrimage around Oxfordshire a few years ago when he was vicar at Deddington, where Newman gave his first public address. Now, with the backing of the bishop of Oxford, White is planning a nine-day pilgrimage route from Oxford to Birmingham, taking in many places associated with Newman.</p> <p>One of the first stops is Littlemore, on the outskirts of Oxford, where Newman founded his first church, St Mary and St Nicholas, and eventually converted to Catholicism in a makeshift chapel in a former staging post. The stable building is now Newman\u2019s College; it houses a library, hosts retreats and shows visitors the rooms where Newman worked. About 2,000 people a year visit and many more are expected after October.</p> <p>On the journey north, where the golden Cotswold stone of Littlemore reddens into the ironstone of the county\u2019s north-western hills, is Holy Trinity church in Over Worton. The mossy church on the brow of a hill is where Newman came in 1824 to deliver his first sermon \u2013 possibly to thank its vicar, Walter Mayers, who awakened Newman\u2019s spirituality at the age of 15.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ce391c3066822b705bf4dddb4b8cdeaec2130631\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce391c3066822b705bf4dddb4b8cdeaec2130631/0_46_4883_2930/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Holy Trinity church in Over Worton, Oxfordshire, where Newman delivered his first sermon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Holy Trinity church in Over Worton, Oxfordshire, where Newman delivered his first sermon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colin Underhill/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Choosing the pilgrimage route involves balancing nature\u2019s tranquillity with the experience of harsher realities, White says. \u201cIt\u2019s a recognition of life as a journey and a pilgrimage towards the heavenly city, the sensation of going into the unknown, the experience of difficulty.\u201d The other key element of pilgrimage is of walking side by side, he says. \u201cThat sort of conversation is totally different to having one face to face.\u201d</p> <p>There remain a significant number of people within the high Anglican tradition who see themselves as following Newman\u2019s lead, and hope his sainthood might help bring Anglicans and Catholics closer together.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a deep longing of lots of people that there should be reunification of various divisions of Christianity,\u201d White says. \u201cNewman is a bit of a symbolic figure for ecumenical endeavour.\u201d</p> <h2>Life and times</h2> <p>Newman was born in 1801, the son of a London banker, and embarked on a life of religion while a student at Trinity College, Oxford. After becoming a fellow of Oriel College, he was ordained as an Anglican priest at 24 and was initially part of the evangelical tradition.</p> <p>By 1833 he had moved towards high Anglicanism, and was one of the leading lights of the Oxford Movement, a group of scholars who argued that the Church of England should restore some of the customs that had been abandoned during the Reformation. The movement published a series of tracts pushing their case, but the 90th tract caused so much opposition that the bishop of Oxford ordered the group to stop.</p> <p>Newman went into deep meditation, and eventually decided to become a Roman Catholic, converting in an impromptu chapel created at a former staging post in Littlemore, a village on the outskirts of Oxford, where he constructed his first church. He bade his farewell to Anglicanism in a famous sermon, The Parting of Friends, but it led to Newman being shunned by his former friends and colleagues. He moved to Birmingham, where he founded England\u2019s first oratory \u2013 a society of priests \u2013 and eventually was made a cardinal by Pope Leo XIII.</p> <p>In 1991 Pope John Paul II declared Newman \u201cvenerable\u201d, putting him on a path to sainthood; Pope Benedict XVI, a Newman scholar, declared him \u201cblessed\u201d; and Pope Francis approved two miracles attributed to him, allowing him to become a saint.</p> <p>Newman was also a poet and writer. James Joyce once remarked that \u201cnobody has ever written English prose that can be compared with that of a tiresome footling little Anglican parson who afterwards became a prince of the only true church\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Father Ignatius Harrison opens a wardrobe door to reveal a rack of scarlet cardinal\u2019s robes. \u201cThese have been here for more than 100 years,\u201d he says. \u201cThis was his dressing chamber.\u201d The \u201che\u201d in question is John Henry Newman who, following an announcement from the Vatican last week, is about to become the only English person born after the 17th century to be declared a Roman Catholic saint. The robes, along with most of Newman\u2019s belongings, were left in his private quarters at the Birmingham Oratory after he died in 1890. Now the preparations for his canonisation are well under way, excitement among his devotees is building and the trickle of pilgrims who already come to venerate Newman is about to turn into a flood. As a result, the robes are to be put on display in a new museum at the oratory. \u201cThe conservationists say they need to be kept in climate-controlled cabinets,\u201d says Harrison, the provost of the oratory. The museum, which will include digitisations of 20,000 Newman manuscripts, is due to open after Pope Francis declares Newman a saint on 13 October in St Peter\u2019s Square at the Vatican. The provost looks momentarily downcast. \u201cApparently it will cost \u00a375,000, so we will need some help.\u201d Newman was perhaps the most influential and controversial English theologian of the 19th century. He became an evangelical, and determinedly protestant, Church of England priest as a young man, but converted to Catholicism aged 44, convinced that Anglicanism was more closely related to Rome than his peers believed. \u201cThe Anglicans thought he was a traitor and a lot of Catholics thought he was a dangerous liberal,\u201d Harrison says. \u201cBeing made a cardinal by Pope Leo XIII was the acceptance that he was sound, solid.\u201d Newman went on to found the Birmingham Oratory, a society of priests, and the school associated with it, and became the first rector of University College Dublin. During his funeral procession in Birmingham, 15,000 people lined the streets. Next door to the dressing room \u2013 now used as Harrison\u2019s office \u2013 is Newman\u2019s study and private chapel, which has also been left exactly as it was after Newman\u2019s death: a chair with a cracked leather seat sits at his desk, on which stand scales for weighing his letters before posting, and a pair of oval spectacles on a bookshelf. \u201cThey say the wallpaper was yellow when it was first put up,\u201d Harrison says. The wall is now a muddy green and would probably not withstand the attentions of a host of pilgrims, so the study will be filmed and displayed on video in the museum. Pilgrims will be able to view the chapel that holds Newman\u2019s remains: a lock of hair and a fragment of bone, in a casket decorated with the brass handles from his coffin. \u201cSince the pope announced the date of the canonisation, I\u2019ve been flooded with requests for small groups to come here,\u201d Harrison says. The making of pilgrimages is growing in Britain and abroad. The Camino de Santiago in Spain, F\u00e1tima in Portugal, the Kumbh Mela in India and the Hajj attract millions of people. In Britain, more than seven million overseas visitors go to at least one religious site, according to the tourism trade body UKinbound, and about 250,000 people visit Walsingham in Norfolk, which has been a site of pilgrimage since 1061, when the lady of the manor said she had a vision of the Virgin Mary. Organisations such as the British Pilgrimage Trust are springing up to cater for their needs. The BPT\u2019s founder, Guy Hayward, believes the growth in pilgrimages \u2013 by secular pilgrims as well as religious \u2013 is an expression of a rejection of rationalism. \u201cI think we\u2019re now moving into a kind of age of experience where people get their knowledge in a different way,\u201d Hayward says, citing the array of online information about faiths. \u201cPeople want to be unified more, connect with the earth, get in touch with their feelings, the community. And pilgrimage does all of that.\u201d Despite Newman\u2019s rejection of the Church of England, many Anglicans still honour him. One, the Rev Dr Hugh White, created a Newman pilgrimage around Oxfordshire a few years ago when he was vicar at Deddington, where Newman gave his first public address. Now, with the backing of the bishop of Oxford, White is planning a nine-day pilgrimage route from Oxford to Birmingham, taking in many places associated with Newman. One of the first stops is Littlemore, on the outskirts of Oxford, where Newman founded his first church, St Mary and St Nicholas, and eventually converted to Catholicism in a makeshift chapel in a former staging post. The stable building is now Newman\u2019s College; it houses a library, hosts retreats and shows visitors the rooms where Newman worked. About 2,000 people a year visit and many more are expected after October. On the journey north, where the golden Cotswold stone of Littlemore reddens into the ironstone of the county\u2019s north-western hills, is Holy Trinity church in Over Worton. The mossy church on the brow of a hill is where Newman came in 1824 to deliver his first sermon \u2013 possibly to thank its vicar, Walter Mayers, who awakened Newman\u2019s spirituality at the age of 15. Choosing the pilgrimage route involves balancing nature\u2019s tranquillity with the experience of harsher realities, White says. \u201cIt\u2019s a recognition of life as a journey and a pilgrimage towards the heavenly city, the sensation of going into the unknown, the experience of difficulty.\u201d The other key element of pilgrimage is of walking side by side, he says. \u201cThat sort of conversation is totally different to having one face to face.\u201d There remain a significant number of people within the high Anglican tradition who see themselves as following Newman\u2019s lead, and hope his sainthood might help bring Anglicans and Catholics closer together. \u201cIt\u2019s a deep longing of lots of people that there should be reunification of various divisions of Christianity,\u201d White says. \u201cNewman is a bit of a symbolic figure for ecumenical endeavour.\u201d Life and times Newman was born in 1801, the son of a London banker, and embarked on a life of religion while a student at Trinity College, Oxford. After becoming a fellow of Oriel College, he was ordained as an Anglican priest at 24 and was initially part of the evangelical tradition. By 1833 he had moved towards high Anglicanism, and was one of the leading lights of the Oxford Movement, a group of scholars who argued that the Church of England should restore some of the customs that had been abandoned during the Reformation. The movement published a series of tracts pushing their case, but the 90th tract caused so much opposition that the bishop of Oxford ordered the group to stop. Newman went into deep meditation, and eventually decided to become a Roman Catholic, converting in an impromptu chapel created at a former staging post in Littlemore, a village on the outskirts of Oxford, where he constructed his first church. He bade his farewell to Anglicanism in a famous sermon, The Parting of Friends, but it led to Newman being shunned by his former friends and colleagues. He moved to Birmingham, where he founded England\u2019s first oratory \u2013 a society of priests \u2013 and eventually was made a cardinal by Pope Leo XIII. In 1991 Pope John Paul II declared Newman \u201cvenerable\u201d, putting him on a path to sainthood; Pope Benedict XVI, a Newman scholar, declared him \u201cblessed\u201d; and Pope Francis approved two miracles attributed to him, allowing him to become a saint. Newman was also a poet and writer. James Joyce once remarked that \u201cnobody has ever written English prose that can be compared with that of a tiresome footling little Anglican parson who afterwards became a prince of the only true church\u201d.",

It\u2019s named after a key food street in the city state. I have long been suspicious of the notion that you should follow specific ethnic groups to find the good stuff. I have wasted too much money in terrible Chinese restaurants serving gnarly bits of meat harvested from animals that clearly died of old age in cornflour-thickened, viciously over-sweetened sauces just because they happened to be full of Chinese people. Sometimes particular groups cluster in certain places more because it\u2019s a social hub than because the kitchen downstairs has a deft way with the classics.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Oh, the laksa.

Plus, I have a taste, verging on the obsessive, for a good Singapore laksa, that generous coconut milk-thickened, chilli-slicked broth, stacked with noodles, seafood, chicken and various other bits and bobs, which make life worth living. If there was the possibility of one of those in my future, Bugis Street demanded my attention.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.millenniumhotels.com/en/london/millennium-gloucester-hotel-london-kensington/\" title=\"\">Millennium Gloucester</a> is a beautiful piece of architecture, if your idea of beauty extends to Stalinist-era pre-stressed grey concrete monoliths of the sort built to house sound-proofed interrogation centres. No matter. I was planning to be inside it, eating, rather than outside squinting at the facade. The restaurant is reached by its own entrance around the corner from the hotel\u2019s main door. It was only when I wandered round there that I clocked its location literally behind the Holiday Inn, for those cabin crew in desperate need of sanctuary.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af9273d97f8dd23fc51bf95a52445fa7dcb2335d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af9273d97f8dd23fc51bf95a52445fa7dcb2335d/0_227_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018There are singed bits and golden bits and roasted bits\u2019: chicken satay.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There are singed bits and golden bits and roasted bits\u2019: chicken satay.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s the right place to seek it, though not because of the room. It is a masterful study in beige. Ceiling fans beat unnecessarily at the cool air of a London summer to summon up a tropical vibe, and there are wooden slatted screens on some of the windows. Ignore this. All the colour and drama will be on the table in front of you.</p> <p>It starts with their chicken satay. These are not the compressed cysts of tortured animal protein impaled on cocktail sticks and dyed yellow that fester in supermarket chiller cabinets across the land. These are smoky pieces of heavily spice-rubbed thigh, the occasional tassels of skin fired to crisp on the grill. There are singed bits and golden bits and roasted bits. With them is the requisite sauce that hits you first with the sweetness of peanut, but which keeps going with layers of spice and aromatics. At first you try to be refined, dipping the chicken in the sauce daintily. Then you take to dragging it through the bowl enthusiastically. Finally, you\u2019re leaving the pieces of chicken on the plate and spooning the sauce over the top. There are, as there should be, cooling pieces of cucumber to settle everything down.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5061188adb7b0b605df284045782508381fa935c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5061188adb7b0b605df284045782508381fa935c/0_81_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A bash of chilli and stock and coconut\u2019: laksa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A bash of chilli and stock and coconut\u2019: laksa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From the list headed \u201cBugis Signatures\u201d comes the classic nasi goreng, a huge plate of rust-coloured rice, mined with spiced chicken, prawns and a few peas for colour and pop, then topped with a fried egg, the yolk from which is just waiting to be pierced. With it comes a deep red sambal with huge toasted chilli notes with which to lubricate the rice and bring out the odd bead of sweat.</p> <p>And then, of course, there is the laksa. Oh, the laksa. If, like me, you have a mental laksa map, a geographical plotting of the best places for the dish, drop a pin for this one. The thicker rice noodles take me by surprise; I\u2019m used to thinner vermicelli, but these have a satisfying slurp. The broth is not overly sweetened. It\u2019s a huge bash of chilli and stock and coconut. It bobs with prawns that have the bite of seafood cooked through only in the hot broth once it hit the bowl. I slurp and sip and dig about very happily.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b13dd2c94780ec1667efc559e5974df1a50d0b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b13dd2c94780ec1667efc559e5974df1a50d0b9/0_180_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A dish for which the words \u201cyes please\u201d were invented\u2019: clay-pot pork.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A dish for which the words \u201cyes please\u201d were invented\u2019: clay-pot pork.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Singapore has long been a culinary crossroads, with ethnic groups being washed ashore in waves and bringing with them their food. So here is a terrifying-looking Malaysian chicken curry made with thigh served on the bone, in a bright red liquor beneath a surface puddle of orange oil perhaps half a centimetre deep. I worry it will be grim and greasy to eat, but it\u2019s nothing of the sort. The pungent gravy seems to emulsify as it gets in your bowl. We have Nyonya pork, in a dark sauce full of cracked black pepper and sweet chilli. From a list of specials awaiting us on the table come chunks of long-braised pork belly, with jelly-like fat, served in a clay pot that\u2019s so hot, the black sauce is still bubbling and spitting at us when it lands. It is a dish for which the words \u201cyes please\u201d were invented.</p> <p>The picture-led dessert menu offers a bunch of slightly worrying things, involving slippery bean curd or sweetened red-bean paste. We retreat to the safety of banana fritters in a palm sugar syrup. It\u2019s unneeded and all the better for that. We drink very little, but there are beers and solid-looking wines for those who want them. Most dishes are priced from around a tenner and into the low teens, alongside set menu options for \u00a312. It\u2019s the sort of place where people come alone at lunchtime for a single plate of good food, and feel very comfortable doing so. If it were relevant, I might tell you it\u2019s packed with people from South East Asia. That happens to be so. But it\u2019s far more useful to know that its true claim on your attention goes far beyond simply being better than the Holiday Inn across the road.</p> <h2><strong>News bites</strong></h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://greyhoundcafe.uk/\">Greyhound Caf\u00e9</a>, the first London branch of a well-known Bangkok group, offers a sprightly, expansive take on the Thai repertoire. The dish names can be a little tiresome \u2013 there\u2019s Salmon in Hot Pursuit, Bugs in My Salad, and Angry Pasta \u2013 but it\u2019s all worth your time. The German style pork knuckle with a kicking tamarind curry paste is a standout, as is the Tom Yum soup with tiger prawns and prawn-stuffed dumplings.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://theproducehall.com/\">Stockport Produce Hall</a>, a site for various street food-style stands, has been criticised for not including enough independent traders in its repertoire, in favour of large-scale restaurant brands. Now they\u2019ve announced that the brilliant Cambodian restaurant <a href=\"http://www.angkorsoul.co.uk/\">Angkor Soul</a> from nearby Marple, will, have a presence there from this month.</p> <p>And on a similar subject <a href=\"https://www.markethalls.co.uk/\">Market Halls</a>, which already operates \u2018multi-vendor\u2019 food courts in London\u2019s Fulham and Victoria has received \u00a320 million of backing from equity firm Bridgepoint Growth, to roll the model out across the country. If the street food movement was once to the restaurant business what indie record labels once were to the majors, that moment appears to be passing.</p> <p><em>Email Jay at <a href=\"mailto:jay.rayner@observer.co.uk\" title=\"\">jay.rayner@observer.co.uk</a> or follow him on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jayrayner1?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">@jayrayner1</a></em></p>",

No matter. I was planning to be inside it, eating, rather than outside squinting at the facade. The restaurant is reached by its own entrance around the corner from the hotel\u2019s main door. It was only when I wandered round there that I clocked its location literally behind the Holiday Inn, for those cabin crew in desperate need of sanctuary. It\u2019s the right place to seek it, though not because of the room. It is a masterful study in beige. Ceiling fans beat unnecessarily at the cool air of a London summer to summon up a tropical vibe, and there are wooden slatted screens on some of the windows. Ignore this. All the colour and drama will be on the table in front of you. It starts with their chicken satay. These are not the compressed cysts of tortured animal protein impaled on cocktail sticks and dyed yellow that fester in supermarket chiller cabinets across the land. These are smoky pieces of heavily spice-rubbed thigh, the occasional tassels of skin fired to crisp on the grill. There are singed bits and golden bits and roasted bits. With them is the requisite sauce that hits you first with the sweetness of peanut, but which keeps going with layers of spice and aromatics. At first you try to be refined, dipping the chicken in the sauce daintily. Then you take to dragging it through the bowl enthusiastically. Finally, you\u2019re leaving the pieces of chicken on the plate and spooning the sauce over the top. There are, as there should be, cooling pieces of cucumber to settle everything down. From the list headed \u201cBugis Signatures\u201d comes the classic nasi goreng, a huge plate of rust-coloured rice, mined with spiced chicken, prawns and a few peas for colour and pop, then topped with a fried egg, the yolk from which is just waiting to be pierced. With it comes a deep red sambal with huge toasted chilli notes with which to lubricate the rice and bring out the odd bead of sweat. And then, of course, there is the laksa. Oh, the laksa. If, like me, you have a mental laksa map, a geographical plotting of the best places for the dish, drop a pin for this one. The thicker rice noodles take me by surprise; I\u2019m used to thinner vermicelli, but these have a satisfying slurp. The broth is not overly sweetened. It\u2019s a huge bash of chilli and stock and coconut. It bobs with prawns that have the bite of seafood cooked through only in the hot broth once it hit the bowl. I slurp and sip and dig about very happily. Singapore has long been a culinary crossroads, with ethnic groups being washed ashore in waves and bringing with them their food. So here is a terrifying-looking Malaysian chicken curry made with thigh served on the bone, in a bright red liquor beneath a surface puddle of orange oil perhaps half a centimetre deep. I worry it will be grim and greasy to eat, but it\u2019s nothing of the sort. The pungent gravy seems to emulsify as it gets in your bowl. We have Nyonya pork, in a dark sauce full of cracked black pepper and sweet chilli. From a list of specials awaiting us on the table come chunks of long-braised pork belly, with jelly-like fat, served in a clay pot that\u2019s so hot, the black sauce is still bubbling and spitting at us when it lands. It is a dish for which the words \u201cyes please\u201d were invented. The picture-led dessert menu offers a bunch of slightly worrying things, involving slippery bean curd or sweetened red-bean paste. We retreat to the safety of banana fritters in a palm sugar syrup. It\u2019s unneeded and all the better for that. We drink very little, but there are beers and solid-looking wines for those who want them. Most dishes are priced from around a tenner and into the low teens, alongside set menu options for \u00a312. It\u2019s the sort of place where people come alone at lunchtime for a single plate of good food, and feel very comfortable doing so. If it were relevant, I might tell you it\u2019s packed with people from South East Asia. That happens to be so. But it\u2019s far more useful to know that its true claim on your attention goes far beyond simply being better than the Holiday Inn across the road. News bites The Greyhound Caf\u00e9, the first London branch of a well-known Bangkok group, offers a sprightly, expansive take on the Thai repertoire. The dish names can be a little tiresome \u2013 there\u2019s Salmon in Hot Pursuit, Bugs in My Salad, and Angry Pasta \u2013 but it\u2019s all worth your time. The German style pork knuckle with a kicking tamarind curry paste is a standout, as is the Tom Yum soup with tiger prawns and prawn-stuffed dumplings. The Stockport Produce Hall, a site for various street food-style stands, has been criticised for not including enough independent traders in its repertoire, in favour of large-scale restaurant brands. Now they\u2019ve announced that the brilliant Cambodian restaurant Angkor Soul from nearby Marple, will, have a presence there from this month. And on a similar subject Market Halls, which already operates \u2018multi-vendor\u2019 food courts in London\u2019s Fulham and Victoria has received \u00a320 million of backing from equity firm Bridgepoint Growth, to roll the model out across the country. If the street food movement was once to the restaurant business what indie record labels once were to the majors, that moment appears to be passing.

She was also a vocal supporter of Colin Kaepernick in kneeling for the national anthem and is at the forefront of the campaign for equal pay in football.</p> <p>Another branch of the male football liberal camp has also emerged during this World Cup. Among its members are leftie types who talk a good game when it comes to women\u2019s football. We\u2019ve learned the names of some of the stars and can trot out their back stories and some of their statistics when required. We\u2019ll take to social media during games and tweet about goals and refereeing decisions with the same argot we deploy when following our favourite men\u2019s teams. That way, our mates know that we\u2019re actually watching the games. Some might call it virtue signalling. The true test of our recently discovered fervour for women\u2019s football will come in the months ahead. In Scotland, the women\u2019s game remains grossly underfunded and unsupported. All of our stars play in England\u2019s professional league, although Celtic have announced that they are to field a professional women\u2019s team from next season. By the end of it, I wonder how many of us who have affected support for and solidarity with women\u2019s football will have attended any matches in the Scottish Women\u2019s Football League?</p> <p>There\u2019s never been a better moment for well-meaning male football supporters to alter a lifetime\u2019s habits and conditioning and support the women\u2019s game by actually parting with some cash to watch a match or even buy some merchandise. The umbilical and spiritual connections to our men\u2019s clubs, passed down from father to son through generations, are all being tested. Football has become the most corporate and ruthlessly capitalistic enterprise on Earth. In other spheres (apart from America) the acolytes of pure, free-market capitalism will attempt to soften the look with charity and academic endowments. In football, there can be no room for such scruples and only the survival of the fittest can be guaranteed.</p> <p>My own club, Celtic, which sports its humble origins like a gaudy chain of office, is now sponsored by three online betting firms, the jackals of working-class football supporters. The European Champions League has been reduced to a boutique competition for the world\u2019s richest clubs, including many such as Chelsea, Manchester City and Paris St Germain, who were never really able to cut it when the playing field was level.</p> <p>Each year we who profess to be socialists, and shout about fairness and inequality, park our consciences and queue to be fleeced by this machine and the money launderers and gangster states that manipulate it.</p> <p>Of course, if women\u2019s football does become a global enterprise, the same corporations will swoop on it too. But for a few years at least our female footballers are giving us an opportunity to observe football in a purer environment.</p> <p>\u2022 Kevin McKenna is an Observer columnist</p>",

We\u2019ve learned the names of some of the stars and can trot out their back stories and some of their statistics when required. We\u2019ll take to social media during games and tweet about goals and refereeing decisions with the same argot we deploy when following our favourite men\u2019s teams. That way, our mates know that we\u2019re actually watching the games. Some might call it virtue signalling. The true test of our recently discovered fervour for women\u2019s football will come in the months ahead. In Scotland, the women\u2019s game remains grossly underfunded and unsupported. All of our stars play in England\u2019s professional league, although Celtic have announced that they are to field a professional women\u2019s team from next season. By the end of it, I wonder how many of us who have affected support for and solidarity with women\u2019s football will have attended any matches in the Scottish Women\u2019s Football League? There\u2019s never been a better moment for well-meaning male football supporters to alter a lifetime\u2019s habits and conditioning and support the women\u2019s game by actually parting with some cash to watch a match or even buy some merchandise. The umbilical and spiritual connections to our men\u2019s clubs, passed down from father to son through generations, are all being tested. Football has become the most corporate and ruthlessly capitalistic enterprise on Earth. In other spheres (apart from America) the acolytes of pure, free-market capitalism will attempt to soften the look with charity and academic endowments. In football, there can be no room for such scruples and only the survival of the fittest can be guaranteed. My own club, Celtic, which sports its humble origins like a gaudy chain of office, is now sponsored by three online betting firms, the jackals of working-class football supporters. The European Champions League has been reduced to a boutique competition for the world\u2019s richest clubs, including many such as Chelsea, Manchester City and Paris St Germain, who were never really able to cut it when the playing field was level. Each year we who profess to be socialists, and shout about fairness and inequality, park our consciences and queue to be fleeced by this machine and the money launderers and gangster states that manipulate it. Of course, if women\u2019s football does become a global enterprise, the same corporations will swoop on it too. But for a few years at least our female footballers are giving us an opportunity to observe football in a purer environment. \u2022 Kevin McKenna is an Observer columnist",

The pair founded the company in 2009. To say they are ambitious is like saying Boris Johnson has a passing talent for publicity. Both have backgrounds in industrial design, but had a complete lack of bike-industry know-how. Many would see this as a drawback \u2013 but not them. They saw it as a strength, enabling them to flip the concept of the city bike on its head and come up with some radical new solutions to the old problems faced by cyclists the world over \u2013 like how to ride up hills without getting sweaty and how not to get your bike pinched. Taco and Ties see Tesla and BMW as competitors for their tech-laden cycles, not other bikes. And, oh yes, they are committed to \u201cgetting the next billion\u201d people on to bicycles.</p> <p>Two frames are offered \u2013 the S and the X \u2013 and these can be bought as regular bikes or as ebikes. It is with the electrified models, however, that the brothers really see their future. Starting from the bottom up, the team at VanMoof has reconsidered everything, from paint quality to how to make the seat more comfortable (under the saddle you\u2019ll see a pair of air pads that look like they\u2019ve been stolen from a pair of trainers). The frame is uncluttered. There is a minimum of gears, cables, buttons and levers. So, although it\u2019s sophisticated, it feels and looks incredibly simple. It aims to do as much for you as it can to take the hassle our of riding. The lights permanently self-charge and activate themselves. There are integral mudguards, a luggage rack and the chain is fully enclosed. The brakes are super-effective discs and the tyres are thick and puncture-proof. I ride everywhere fully expecting to get a flat \u2013 this is a bike on which you never expect to have to stop. And then there\u2019s the really clever stuff. The bike is controlled through an app on your phone and has a stealth lock concealed in the rear hub, which you can kick to activate, or apply by selecting the padlock icon on the app. The bike makes a range of sounds to communicate with you, from powering up to a nasty growl if you try to move it when it\u2019s locked. You can control power, check its charge and even the bike\u2019s location all from your phone. It\u2019s as close as a bike can get to being unstealable. Even if it is stolen, VanMoof has a team of \u201cbike hunters\u201d who will use the bikes GPS to track it down and return it to you.</p> <p>Powering all this is a 504Wh battery invisibly housed in the down tube. It drives a silent 250W motor in the front-wheel hub. It produces a legal max speed of 25 km/h (15.5 mph). It has a two-speed automatic transmission. It\u2019s pedal assist, which means as soon as you start to pedal you feel a surge of power, almost as if you are being pushed along the road. It\u2019s tempting to think of ebikes as being speed machines. They\u2019re not. My commute time was the same, though it was a lot easier \u2013 and less sweaty. There is also a power boost button you can press if you want a short blast of speed to help you overtake or go up a hill more speedily.</p> <p>The VanMoof is a real game changer. On the afternoon I showed it to Richard, about half a dozen people stopped and all wanted a go. For many it was the first time they\u2019d tried an ebike and for all of them it was the first time they\u2019d even considered riding in the city. For all it was a real gee-whiz moment.. The only duff note, literally, is the electric bell. It sounds like a broken microwave. But then it\u2019s good to have something to improve next time round.</p> <p><strong>Cool kit</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40ac7fe4eca9cf1b1e92ffabdaf577a1bc8b2b45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/40ac7fe4eca9cf1b1e92ffabdaf577a1bc8b2b45/252_123_991_1239/800.png\" alt=\"In the pink: keep dry even in the hot summer sun.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the pink: keep dry even in the hot summer sun.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Keep cool on your ride, even when it\u2019s very hot, in a moisture-wicking Drynamo top.

Taco and Ties see Tesla and BMW as competitors for their tech-laden cycles, not other bikes. And, oh yes, they are committed to \u201cgetting the next billion\u201d people on to bicycles. Two frames are offered \u2013 the S and the X \u2013 and these can be bought as regular bikes or as ebikes. It is with the electrified models, however, that the brothers really see their future. Starting from the bottom up, the team at VanMoof has reconsidered everything, from paint quality to how to make the seat more comfortable (under the saddle you\u2019ll see a pair of air pads that look like they\u2019ve been stolen from a pair of trainers). The frame is uncluttered. There is a minimum of gears, cables, buttons and levers. So, although it\u2019s sophisticated, it feels and looks incredibly simple. It aims to do as much for you as it can to take the hassle our of riding. The lights permanently self-charge and activate themselves. There are integral mudguards, a luggage rack and the chain is fully enclosed. The brakes are super-effective discs and the tyres are thick and puncture-proof. I ride everywhere fully expecting to get a flat \u2013 this is a bike on which you never expect to have to stop. And then there\u2019s the really clever stuff. The bike is controlled through an app on your phone and has a stealth lock concealed in the rear hub, which you can kick to activate, or apply by selecting the padlock icon on the app. The bike makes a range of sounds to communicate with you, from powering up to a nasty growl if you try to move it when it\u2019s locked. You can control power, check its charge and even the bike\u2019s location all from your phone. It\u2019s as close as a bike can get to being unstealable. Even if it is stolen, VanMoof has a team of \u201cbike hunters\u201d who will use the bikes GPS to track it down and return it to you. Powering all this is a 504Wh battery invisibly housed in the down tube. It drives a silent 250W motor in the front-wheel hub. It produces a legal max speed of 25 km/h (15.5 mph). It has a two-speed automatic transmission. It\u2019s pedal assist, which means as soon as you start to pedal you feel a surge of power, almost as if you are being pushed along the road. It\u2019s tempting to think of ebikes as being speed machines. They\u2019re not. My commute time was the same, though it was a lot easier \u2013 and less sweaty. There is also a power boost button you can press if you want a short blast of speed to help you overtake or go up a hill more speedily. The VanMoof is a real game changer. On the afternoon I showed it to Richard, about half a dozen people stopped and all wanted a go. For many it was the first time they\u2019d tried an ebike and for all of them it was the first time they\u2019d even considered riding in the city. For all it was a real gee-whiz moment.. The only duff note, literally, is the electric bell. It sounds like a broken microwave. But then it\u2019s good to have something to improve next time round. Cool kit Keep cool on your ride, even when it\u2019s very hot, in a moisture-wicking Drynamo top.

It doesn\u2019t appear in my trusty Chambers and long may it remain that way. In light of Facebook\u2019s launch of its cryptocurrency Libra, commentators of all stripes have been quick to pour scorn and doubt on the venture and its ilk. But even the most respected of these brethren can leave one feeling flummoxed. \u201cThe potential for a central bank digital currency to \u2018disintermediate\u2019 the banking sector has major implications for the provision of credit to the economy.\u201d I did look it up, but am glad that the writer put it in inverted commas. Like personhood, it should be swiftly dispatched into the long grass. Meanwhile, in my occasional series on alternative employment paths that my schools careers adviser might have recommended (that man\u2019s failings grow by the week), I now learn, after the divorce of Jeff Bezos from his wife, MacKenzie, that I could have been a \u201ccelebrity crisis communications consultant\u201d. Now how swanky does that sound. You put your oar into a high-profile bust-up and presumably charge thousands upon thousands of dollars for your services, regardless of the outcome. Just the ticket. After the execrable words above, a hymn of praise. Weather forecasters will insist on talking of mist and murk, spits and spots. But what joy when you come across terms such as the following: \u201cnoctilucent clouds are heavenly electric-blue threads rippling across the sky at twilight\u201d. What a blissful phrase, and almost enough to make one forget Facebook. \u2022Jonathan Bouquet is an Observer columnist",

This is my account of that memorable evening.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/06/brazilian-musician-joao-gilberto-dies-aged-88\">Brazilian musician Jo\u00e3o Gilberto dies aged 88</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>\u2018This anxious man in a brown suit\u2019</h2> <p>The man holding the guitar has the nervous look of someone who has just stepped off a subway train and now worries he has picked the wrong stop. The concert promoter is taken aback by his unexpected appearance \u2013 she is still in the midst of her introduction (\u201cI would like to thank my boyfriend, I would like to thank the audience for being here \u2026\u201d). She has not yet mentioned the \u201cstar of the evening\u201d, Jo\u00e3o Gilberto. And here he is onstage now, looking very unlike the evening star, this anxious man in a brown suit, who wants to get back on the subway train but is afraid that it has already left the station.</p> <p>As was the case at Carnegie Hall a few nights before, the audience gives a standing ovation merely at a glimpse of the performer. The warm welcome may backfire. Applause seems only to amplify Gilberto\u2019s stage fright. But retreat is impossible, the train has certainly left the station by now. He moves to the small padded bench at centre stage, sits down and stares at his feet.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=So718wk426c\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/So718wk426c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Getting on stage may be the most difficult part of a concert for Jo\u00e3o Gilberto, legendary inventor of the bossa nova style. Twenty-one years have passed since his last performance in San Francisco. But veterans of the nightclub scene still recall his engagement with Stan Getz at the now-defunct Keystone Korner \u2013 where club owner Todd Barkan virtually needed to shove Gilberto out on stage. His reclusion is well known, and few expected him ever to perform again in the United States.</p> <p>Many stories are told of Gilberto\u2019s shyness.

When Jo\u00e3o phoned her one day to borrow a deck of playing cards, she quickly complied, seeing this as her chance to break through the barriers that kept him out of contact with other human beings. To no avail.

The applause has yet to die down, but suddenly the audience becomes quiet, strains to hear what he is saying. No, he is not whispering, it just seems that way. He is singing, but very softly. I am in the third row, only a few feet away, yet it takes me some time before I can hear his guitar, which is even quieter than his voice.</p> <p>The confusion is not surprising. Gilberto\u2019s singing style is as shy as his stage demeanour. Miles Davis once said that Jo\u00e3o\u2019s delivery was so hypnotic that he \u201cwould sound good reading a newspaper.\u201d The analogy is apt in many ways. Gilberto is almost as quiet as a man reading the newspaper, almost as introspective, as unaware of what\u2019s happening around him. When Tom Jobim first brought Gilberto to the attention of record company executives four decades ago, they listened in shocked silence to this singer who hardly moved his lips.

Five years later, the bossa craze reached America, where Gilberto teamed with Stan Getz for a recording which spawned the hit single Girl from Ipanema, and spent almost two years on the Billboard album charts.</p> <p>Gilberto was a revolutionary, but one who retained strong links to the previous generation of Brazilian musicians. On his US tour he performs the many Jobim compositions that he made famous, but also plays pieces by Ary Barroso and Dorival Caymmi, whose songs were recorded by Camen Miranda before the second world war. And he is equally at home with the later generation of Brazilian \u201cTropicalist\u201d songwriters, such as Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil. Many in the audience were no doubt surprised when Gilberto sang S\u2019Wonderful in English, but George Gershwin and Cole Porter are equally part of his tradition.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxfPqIF346M\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MxfPqIF346M?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Gilberto is anything but derivative in his use of these influences. They become part of his musical vision; he never adapts to them. His relationship to the audience is similar. They must come to him, to the artistic space he occupies \u2013 it is not in his nature to reach out to them. And this is perhaps the most beautiful aspect of the concert: how the listeners brought themselves to the shy man on stage, adapting to his soft dynamics, his under-stated sensibility, his artistic vision. In a day and age when performers resort to the basest tricks and grandest gestures to reach the audience, Gilberto\u2019s role reversal is endearing.</p> <p>His singing has become even more eccentric with the passing years. His voice on the 1958 recordings may have struck listeners by its soft-spoken ambiance, but today it is even more conversational, even less declamatory. His phrasing of lyrics has always been unusual, but is even more so now. Jo\u00e3o is skilled at singing behind the beat, like many jazz singers, but his ability to phrase ahead of the beat is even more remarkable. Few singers attempt to push the beat in this manner, because doing so tends to impart a rushed and anxious quality to the music. It remains a mystery to me how Gilberto can propel the lyrics one bar or more ahead of the music, yet continue to sound so extraordinarily relaxed. One is reminded of the jets flying high in the sky, which we are told travel at fantastic speeds, yet from our vantage point appear to be moving at a slow, leisurely pace.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2019/jul/06/joao-gilberto-obituary\">Jo\u00e3o Gilberto obituary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Everything about the sound of Gilberto\u2019s music conveys relaxation.

With its implicit reference to the world of fads and fashions, a \u201cstyle\u201d has become something superficial, something that we can discard when a new \u201cstyle\u201d comes out next season. Gilberto\u2019s music defies this attitude. It is one of essences, not superficialities. As such, it is beyond concerns of style. His music has not changed, one feels, because his being has not changed. I am convinced that this is connected to his ambivalence about his audience. On stage he appears to be performing for himself.

Yet even before the house lights come on, I know that we will not be seeing any more of Jo\u00e3o Gilberto in San Francisco \u2013 not this evening, not any evening, according to my odds. And I am reasonably sure that the louder the audience claps, the more they frighten our evening star, the faster he retreats back into his private constellation.</p>",

If you had the chance to watch him perform live, you seized the opportunity because it might never happen again.

And here he is onstage now, looking very unlike the evening star, this anxious man in a brown suit, who wants to get back on the subway train but is afraid that it has already left the station.

His reclusion is well known, and few expected him ever to perform again in the United States. Many stories are told of Gilberto\u2019s shyness. Some may well be apocryphal: for instance, the account of Elba Ramahlo, a well-know singer in her own right, reportedly moving into the same apartment building as Gilberto, in an attempt to befriend him. When Jo\u00e3o phoned her one day to borrow a deck of playing cards, she quickly complied, seeing this as her chance to break through the barriers that kept him out of contact with other human beings.

      "bodyText": "The Labor frontbencher Catherine King says the party remains \u201cconcerned\u201d about the cost of the third stage of the tax cut package, but says it is too early to commit to repealing the measure. King, who took over the infrastructure portfolio from Anthony Albanese following the 18 May election, defended Labor\u2019s decision to back the full $158bn tax cut package despite holding concerns it was \u201ceconomically irresponsible\u201d. Labor sided with the Coalition when the tax package came to a vote in the Senate on Thursday after its bid to amend the legislation to hive off the third stage was unsuccessful. \u201cWe thought it was important to make sure that we got money into people\u2019s pocket, but clearly we remain concerned about stage three, particularly given five years from now we do not know what the economic circumstances are going to be,\u201d King told the ABC\u2019s Insiders program. \u201cThe government\u2019s claiming that somehow or another they\u2019re magically going to find $9bn in the year that they start to kick in, and not cut any services. Now, that\u2019s just a nonsense.\u201d Labor holds concerns that about a third of the $95bn cost over the decade of the third stage would flow to those earning more than $180,000, and had been divided internally over whether to block the entire package when presented with the \u201call or nothing\u201d option. After the passage of the bill through the parliament, the first stage that provides a payment of up to $1,080 for low- and middle-income earners will begin flowing from next week. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning When asked why Labor would not commit immediately to repeal the third stage if it won the next election \u2013 as it had done in the previous parliament when it opposed earlier tax cuts \u2013 King said it was \u201ctoo early to talk about it\u201d. \u201cThese are tax cuts that come in 2024-25 \u2013 we don\u2019t know what the economy will be doing, we don\u2019t know what the fiscal circumstances will be,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Liberals will have policies at the next election, we\u2019ll have policies at the next election \u2026 and we\u2019re three years away from an election.\u201d Amid slowing economic circumstances, King said the government needed to focus urgently on bringing forward \u201cshovel-ready\u201d infrastructure projects, pointing to calls from the Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, for more fiscal stimulus. \u201cThere are projects \u2026 (that) are shovel-ready, which should be invested in now and the government should bring those forward,\u201d King said. \u201cThat\u2019s important for productivity and it\u2019s also important for making sure that we get some stimulus into the economy now as well.\u201d King also pressured the government over the low amount of the Newstart payment, which has not been increased since 1994 in real terms, saying that she did not believe there was a politician in the country who thought the current rate was a \u201cliveable income\u201d. \u201cIt simply is not. We obviously went to the election saying that we wanted to review it, (but) we lost the election,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re three years away again from another election and being able to do something about it.\u201d",
