      "body": "<p>Stories are scattered like confetti across south-east London\u2019s streets for Greenwich and Docklands international festival, where the opening night saw robots roam, streamers fly and dancers dangle from cranes.</p> <p>It starts in a caravan. For the last six months, theatre company Action Hero has travelled around Europe asking strangers to sing love songs. The project responds to a lack of listening from both sides in the conversations about Brexit. Gemma Paintin and James Stenhouse wanted to find something that crossed the divide. Mum, grandma and I pick a song grandma has sung to us since childhood. We scooch in and sing together, if in slightly different keys and time signatures.</p> <p>Action Hero have created hotspots across Europe, with one on Greenwich Park\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/greenwich-park/things-to-see-and-do/the-meridian-line\">meridian line</a>, where you can listen to all of the songs collected. They will play for 24 hours a day in perpetuity; a mark of endless love. It\u2019s a generous piece. There\u2019s something extremely buoyant about such a brief encounter frozen for ever.</p> <p>More explosive is Initiative.dkf\u2019s political piece Scalped. Created by Damilola K Fashola, the agitated dance exhibition explores the scrutiny of black women\u2019s hair. Five young women itch with the weight of other people\u2019s judgments, clawing their bodies against the pavement and each other. They create intimacy on this huge outdoor stage as what starts as oppression gives way first to celebration, then to fury.

      "bodyText": "Stories are scattered like confetti across south-east London\u2019s streets for Greenwich and Docklands international festival, where the opening night saw robots roam, streamers fly and dancers dangle from cranes. It starts in a caravan. For the last six months, theatre company Action Hero has travelled around Europe asking strangers to sing love songs. The project responds to a lack of listening from both sides in the conversations about Brexit. Gemma Paintin and James Stenhouse wanted to find something that crossed the divide. Mum, grandma and I pick a song grandma has sung to us since childhood. We scooch in and sing together, if in slightly different keys and time signatures. Action Hero have created hotspots across Europe, with one on Greenwich Park\u2019s meridian line, where you can listen to all of the songs collected. They will play for 24 hours a day in perpetuity; a mark of endless love. It\u2019s a generous piece. There\u2019s something extremely buoyant about such a brief encounter frozen for ever. More explosive is Initiative.dkf\u2019s political piece Scalped. Created by Damilola K Fashola, the agitated dance exhibition explores the scrutiny of black women\u2019s hair. Five young women itch with the weight of other people\u2019s judgments, clawing their bodies against the pavement and each other. They create intimacy on this huge outdoor stage as what starts as oppression gives way first to celebration, then to fury. They pulsate to Tyrone Isaac-Stuart\u2019s forceful sound design before climbing a metallic profile of a woman with enormous wigs in varying styles, standing triumphant above our gaze. Across the street is Close-Act Theatre\u2019s i-Puppets parade. Hoisted above human controllers, the robotic puppets pounce with pincers and a giant looming eye, exuding an alien bubbling sound. The three puppeteers look like spies with dark glasses. They\u2019re brilliant at riffing with the crowd, diving into selfies and chasing children down the street.

There\u2019s much more energy to it. It\u2019s more exciting. And as a monitor engineer, you\u2019re on the side of the stage with the band, so you see a show you wouldn\u2019t normally see.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been on tour with Blondie, Emeli Sand\u00e9 and the Subways, but my guilty pleasure is progressive rock shows \u2013 I once toured the Pink Floyd tribute band, and listening to that music every day was wonderful. One of the reasons I got into this was because I didn\u2019t want to pay for gig tickets all the time.</p> <p>I started when I was 19. I did <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/01/ariana-grande-justin-bieber-pharrell-grammys-women\">music production</a> at college and from there met a sound company, and I was taken on and had a mentor for a long time.

He was right.</p> <p>In the early days, the equipment was a lot heavier, but now there\u2019s a lot less of it and it\u2019s less heavy, which has given women a lot more access to this side of the industry. I can fly a whole PA system pretty much on my own now, without the help of a crew.</p> <p>A lot of that has really helped because, back then, I was assumed to be a colleague\u2019s girlfriend, or just somebody he was hanging out with.

I\u2019ve been literally pushed out of the way for a guy to jump on the desk.</p> <p>As a young woman, there was a lot of that, and I think a lot of women would quit over that.</p> <p>The physical and emotional <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/20/perfectionism-and-poverty-why-musicians-struggle-with-mental-health\">demands</a> of tour plays both ways to both men and women. Especially in the music industry at the moment, conversations about mental health are becoming very public. I think for a long time there had been a lot of denial about this, but more recently support is coming through. Touring is a lot of work, it\u2019s very intense and very fast. Days are normally from 9am to midnight or 1am. There\u2019s a lot of downtime after tour and then a lot of work. And we have a thing called \u201ctour comedown\u201d: you come back from tour \u2013 where everything is very regimented \u2013 and you\u2019ve got to kind of readjust to real life.

Whether they\u2019re helping you learn about your body, or arming you with the tools to navigate the internet better, a whole swath of female coders, makers and engineers are making sure the technology we interact with works for everyone \u2013 not just men.</p> <p>The space seeing the most action is one called \u201cfemtech\u201d. Short for \u201cfemale technology\u201d, it\u2019s a category of technology that encompasses products, apps and other digital services from companies focused on women\u2019s health. This includes everything from fertility and periods, to sex and pregnancy. The term femtech was coined by Ida Tin, founder of menstruation app Clue, which enables people to track things such as their weight, moods, sleep, energy, cravings and bleeding.

Whether they\u2019re helping you learn about your body, or arming you with the tools to navigate the internet better, a whole swath of female coders, makers and engineers are making sure the technology we interact with works for everyone \u2013 not just men. The space seeing the most action is one called \u201cfemtech\u201d. Short for \u201cfemale technology\u201d, it\u2019s a category of technology that encompasses products, apps and other digital services from companies focused on women\u2019s health. This includes everything from fertility and periods, to sex and pregnancy. The term femtech was coined by Ida Tin, founder of menstruation app Clue, which enables people to track things such as their weight, moods, sleep, energy, cravings and bleeding.

      "bodyText": "If a teacher hadn\u2019t encouraged her, Yvonne Baker might never have gone into engineering: \u201cShe inspired me at a time when it was unheard for girls to consider it.\u201d Baker\u2019s glad she made that choice \u2013 as a chartered chemical engineer, she now leads efforts to persuade people to choose science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem). \u201cTeachers can be the ones who can change things \u2013 they\u2019re a key part of solving the engineering skills shortage and encouraging more girls,\u201d says Baker, who now heads Stem Learning, which provides education and careers support. Worried about a lack of maths and physics teachers, the government is focusing on finding more and hanging on to them, with a new recruitment and retention strategy launched this year. This supports teachers and offers flexible working. With phased bonuses of up to \u00a310,000, the government hopes to encourage maths teachers to stay on after training \u2013 in total, \u00a3406m is being invested specifically on maths, digital and technical education. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t leave now if you paid me,\u201d says science teacher, Helen Staton, who teaches biology and science in Southampton, Hampshire. She joined via Teach First, a charity that focuses on recruiting for shortage subjects, in 2016. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s about teaching what science actually is,\u201d says Staton. \u201cKids don\u2019t understand the amazing careers available.\u201d But there aren\u2019t enough teachers like Staton. Just half of maths and physics teachers stay on in state schools beyond five years \u2013 that\u2019s worse than the overall retention rate of 60%, a 2018 report from the Education Policy Institute shows. Today, there are more pupils \u2013 now nearly 17 per teacher, up from 15.5 in 2010. By 2025, a population bulge means there\u2019ll be 15% more pupils in secondary schools than in 2018. Not even half of maths and physics teachers hold a relevant degree. \u201cIf it\u2019s not your specialist subject, you\u2019re less able to inspire pupils,\u201d says Dr Rhys Morgan, director of engineering and education at the Royal Academy of Engineering. And this is bad news for engineering. \u201cHalf of all A-level physics students go on to study engineering,\u201d says Morgan. \u201cBut only 20% of A-level physics students are girls. We need to address this early on in schools.\u201d Some universities have dropped the physics requirement for their engineering degrees in order to widen entry to more women, but this risks marginalising physics as a subject in schools, says Morgan. Since 2010, the number of girls taking Stem A-levels has risen 26%, and in the latest intake the government recruited 5,900 science and maths trainees \u2013 up 500 from the previous year. Entries to GCSE computer science are rising faster than for any other subject. But the salaries science and maths teachers earn fall below those of the private sector \u2013 maths teachers in their late 20s earn about \u00a34,000 less than their graduate peers. Engineering companies have a role to play, too, says Baker. And a scheme to bring in teachers to summer work placements has been successful. \u201cIt helps when you can say: \u2018I met a person who did this,\u2019\u201d says Morgan. Teachers are also more likely to stay if their skills are boosted by training \u2013 and Stem Learning\u2019s subject-specific development makes it 160% more likely that science teachers will remain in their profession. \u201cIndustry says we need more engineers,\u201d says Morgan. \u201cBut I believe we need to divert some of them into teaching.\u201d Download our women in engineering supplement (pdf)",

      "body": "<p>When most people think of a sound engineer, the person that springs to mind is a man: be it in a recording studio or behind the sound desk at a live performance. Even the language used is often gendered: \u201cthe sound guy\u201d. Technical roles in music in general \u2013 producers and mixers, for example \u2013 are almost always perceived as the realm of men.</p> <p>Like most stereotypes, this has a basis in fact \u2013 in both North America and the UK, for example, it\u2019s a regularly repeated statistic that <a href=\"https://www.wfmt.com/2018/09/27/less-than-5-of-audio-engineers-are-women-this-is-my-story/\" title=\"\">less than 5% of audio engineers are women</a>. Unfortunately, this is not a number that has changed with any great significance over the past two decades.</p> <p>So what is it about music tech that makes the numbers so strikingly disparate between men and women? In part, it might well be a self-fulfilling stereotype.</p> <p>Firstly, a lack of representation might make it seem an impossible pursuit. <a href=\"https://www.solarmanagement.co.uk/marta-salogni\">Marta Salogni</a> is a professional sound engineer, producer and mixer, whose body of work includes recordings with the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/12/the-xx-i-see-you-review-stepping-out-of-their-own-shadow\">The xx</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/21/frank-ocean-album-blonde-dissect-cole-cuchna\">Frank Ocean</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/26/bjork-utopia-review\">Bj\u00f6rk</a>. Now based in London, it was back in her village in Lombardy, Italy, aged 16, when she became fascinated with the concept of sound engineering. \u201cIt made me a little bit scared because I couldn\u2019t cling on to any role model \u2013 there was no one to demonstrate that that career was possible, and I felt alone a lot of the time.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2019/jun/24/you-lift-with-your-mind-not-with-your-muscles-female-sound-engineers-on-working-in-audio\">\u2018You lift with your mind, not with your muscles\u2019: female sound engineers on working in audio</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In turn, she says, this may have been what pushed her to find other people like her, and to succeed so that it became more normal to see women in these spaces. It\u2019s been a fruitful pursuit \u2013 Salogni is one of the most high-profile women in the field in Europe, and yet she finds this a strange position to be in. \u201cGoing into this profession knowing you\u2019re going to be unique means you\u2019re put under a spotlight automatically,\u201d she sighs. \u201cBeing told: \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve never worked with a woman before\u2019 doesn\u2019t feel like a compliment \u2013 it just makes me feel like I have to do a lot of work to rebalance this whole mess.\u201d</p> <p>Salogni also says the concept of what a recording studio used to be like at the height of rock\u2019n\u2019roll patriarchy (\u201ca sexist man cave\u201d) can still affect the dynamic, not only in terms of how she feels in that space, but how she is perceived there \u2013 she notes that if women are expecting to feel uncomfortable in a space, then not all of them are going to be up for fighting to be there.</p> <p>\u201cPeople have come to the studio, they\u2019ll look around and try to understand why I\u2019m there, what my role could be. And you can feel that on yourself, obviously \u2013 that person is doubting you,\u201d Salogni says. \u201cSubconsciously, I hold on to that prejudice \u2013 I used to be really worried people would come into the studio and think I was not good enough, because I am a woman, or that I\u2019m not in charge, because I\u2019m a woman.\u201d</p> <p>While <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/21/brits-2019-we-need-female-creativity-for-british-music-to-stay-relevant\">representation</a> is important, waiting on meritocracy isn\u2019t enough to redress the balance, Salogni says, alluding to the necessity for positive discrimination. More and more schemes are coming into place to try to make this a reality \u2013 Spotify launched the <a href=\"https://makeiteql.com/\">EQL Directory</a> in association with organisation <a href=\"https://soundgirls.org/\">SoundGirls</a> last year, providing a list of women and gender non-conforming audio professionals. It is, as SoundGirls say on their website, \u201ca useful tool when people say \u2018they want to hire women but can\u2019t find any.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Then there are organisations such as <a href=\"https://saffronmusic.co.uk/\">Saffron</a> \u2013 a Bristol-based group that\u2019s part record label and part educational facility for women, founded by Laura Lewis-Paul in 2015. Among other things, Saffron runs \u201cSaffron For Sound\u201d, women-only courses in partnership with dBs \u2013 a local music college \u2013 teaching about music production software such as Ableton and Logic, as well as studio engineering.</p> <p>Lizzy Ellis from the organisation explains: \u201cWhen I did <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jun/07/subject-guide-music\">music tech</a> at college, I was the only girl in the class \u2013 so I think we\u2019ve certainly managed to create an environment that\u2019s much less intimidating for women, that\u2019s accepting people wherever they\u2019re at.\u201d</p> <p>In addition to the issues of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/oct/12/tonights-live-music-acts-will-mostly-be-male-only-whats-holding-women-back\">representation</a> and a potential <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/17/music-industry-sexual-harassment-brit-awards-white-roses\">lack of respect</a> from men in the industry, Ellis posits that jobs in sound engineering can often require \u201cunsociable and long hours\u201d, especially for those working in the live arena who might be on touring crews for long periods of time. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sit with the standard idea of a family setup for women \u2013 which shouldn\u2019t make a difference, but, unfortunately, it often does. That\u2019s part of a much wider conversation, obviously.\u201d</p> <p>Both Salogni and Ellis are also aware that the push for inclusivity in the audiosphere needs to go beyond talking about women, too \u2013 no statistics exist specifically breaking down the number of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) and/or working class women in these spaces, but Salogni notes the space is one dominated by \u201cmiddle-class white people\u201d.</p> <p>For now, hopefully initiatives such as Spotify and SoundGirls\u2019 EQL Directory, development platforms such as Saffron, and women dominating in the field can help push the conversation forward. The 5% statistic is one that Salogni laughs off \u2013 she\u2019s heard it so many times. \u201cHopefully in 10 years\u2019 time, we\u2019ll be closer to 50-50 and women won\u2019t have to do interviews about this any more.\u201d</p> <h2>Everything you need to know about sound engineering</h2> <p><strong>Sound engineering is the process</strong> by which all the elements of audio or a live performance are recorded and/or pieced together to sound as refined as possible: so that\u2019s everything from knowing the acoustics of a room, to deciding on the levels, knowing which microphones to use and where best to place them.</p> <p><strong>Producing was once a very separate</strong> role from engineering but, increasingly, it now crosses over. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/01/ariana-grande-justin-bieber-pharrell-grammys-women\">Producers</a> work with the artist on the track in a less technical way, helping to make the artistic choices \u2013 so it\u2019s making the track the best it can be, but on a compositional level. For example, choosing the instrument that might sound best, suggesting a different song structure, and coaxing the best performance out of an artist.</p> <p><strong>Often, sound engineers are also the mixers</strong> \u2013 although this too can be a separate job. Mixing is the final stage \u2013 once the recording is finished, the mixer will take the files, or the tape, and create a balanced composition. So, say there were nine microphones recording one guitar, the mixer would have to take these nine different recordings and mix them together, and then \u2013 depending on what the composition calls for \u2013 mix in the other instruments, vocals, etc. They are also in charge of making the choices on volume levels and additional effects.</p> <p><strong>If you\u2019ve watched Netflix documentary </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/24/the-defiant-ones-review-dr-dres-american-dream-comes-vividly-to-life\">The Defiant Ones</a>, you will be aware there was once a time when simply being available at all hours and learning by practising was how you became a sound engineer. Nowadays, things are very different \u2013 in most cases, specific training is required in the appropriate technology and software (Pro Tools, for example), be that in a higher education institution or an apprenticeship scheme. According to PayScale, the average salary for a sound engineer is \u00a325,000 per annum, with stats suggesting the gender divide is now 95% men and 5% women.</p> <ul> <li><p>Download our <a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/06/21/Women_in_engineering_full_smaller.pdf\">women in engineering</a> supplement (pdf)</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "When most people think of a sound engineer, the person that springs to mind is a man: be it in a recording studio or behind the sound desk at a live performance. Even the language used is often gendered: \u201cthe sound guy\u201d. Technical roles in music in general \u2013 producers and mixers, for example \u2013 are almost always perceived as the realm of men. Like most stereotypes, this has a basis in fact \u2013 in both North America and the UK, for example, it\u2019s a regularly repeated statistic that less than 5% of audio engineers are women. Unfortunately, this is not a number that has changed with any great significance over the past two decades. So what is it about music tech that makes the numbers so strikingly disparate between men and women? In part, it might well be a self-fulfilling stereotype. Firstly, a lack of representation might make it seem an impossible pursuit. Marta Salogni is a professional sound engineer, producer and mixer, whose body of work includes recordings with the likes of The xx, Frank Ocean and Bj\u00f6rk. Now based in London, it was back in her village in Lombardy, Italy, aged 16, when she became fascinated with the concept of sound engineering. \u201cIt made me a little bit scared because I couldn\u2019t cling on to any role model \u2013 there was no one to demonstrate that that career was possible, and I felt alone a lot of the time.\u201d In turn, she says, this may have been what pushed her to find other people like her, and to succeed so that it became more normal to see women in these spaces. It\u2019s been a fruitful pursuit \u2013 Salogni is one of the most high-profile women in the field in Europe, and yet she finds this a strange position to be in. \u201cGoing into this profession knowing you\u2019re going to be unique means you\u2019re put under a spotlight automatically,\u201d she sighs. \u201cBeing told: \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve never worked with a woman before\u2019 doesn\u2019t feel like a compliment \u2013 it just makes me feel like I have to do a lot of work to rebalance this whole mess.\u201d Salogni also says the concept of what a recording studio used to be like at the height of rock\u2019n\u2019roll patriarchy (\u201ca sexist man cave\u201d) can still affect the dynamic, not only in terms of how she feels in that space, but how she is perceived there \u2013 she notes that if women are expecting to feel uncomfortable in a space, then not all of them are going to be up for fighting to be there. \u201cPeople have come to the studio, they\u2019ll look around and try to understand why I\u2019m there, what my role could be. And you can feel that on yourself, obviously \u2013 that person is doubting you,\u201d Salogni says. \u201cSubconsciously, I hold on to that prejudice \u2013 I used to be really worried people would come into the studio and think I was not good enough, because I am a woman, or that I\u2019m not in charge, because I\u2019m a woman.\u201d While representation is important, waiting on meritocracy isn\u2019t enough to redress the balance, Salogni says, alluding to the necessity for positive discrimination. More and more schemes are coming into place to try to make this a reality \u2013 Spotify launched the EQL Directory in association with organisation SoundGirls last year, providing a list of women and gender non-conforming audio professionals. It is, as SoundGirls say on their website, \u201ca useful tool when people say \u2018they want to hire women but can\u2019t find any.\u2019\u201d Then there are organisations such as Saffron \u2013 a Bristol-based group that\u2019s part record label and part educational facility for women, founded by Laura Lewis-Paul in 2015. Among other things, Saffron runs \u201cSaffron For Sound\u201d, women-only courses in partnership with dBs \u2013 a local music college \u2013 teaching about music production software such as Ableton and Logic, as well as studio engineering. Lizzy Ellis from the organisation explains: \u201cWhen I did music tech at college, I was the only girl in the class \u2013 so I think we\u2019ve certainly managed to create an environment that\u2019s much less intimidating for women, that\u2019s accepting people wherever they\u2019re at.\u201d In addition to the issues of representation and a potential lack of respect from men in the industry, Ellis posits that jobs in sound engineering can often require \u201cunsociable and long hours\u201d, especially for those working in the live arena who might be on touring crews for long periods of time. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sit with the standard idea of a family setup for women \u2013 which shouldn\u2019t make a difference, but, unfortunately, it often does. That\u2019s part of a much wider conversation, obviously.\u201d Both Salogni and Ellis are also aware that the push for inclusivity in the audiosphere needs to go beyond talking about women, too \u2013 no statistics exist specifically breaking down the number of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) and/or working class women in these spaces, but Salogni notes the space is one dominated by \u201cmiddle-class white people\u201d. For now, hopefully initiatives such as Spotify and SoundGirls\u2019 EQL Directory, development platforms such as Saffron, and women dominating in the field can help push the conversation forward. The 5% statistic is one that Salogni laughs off \u2013 she\u2019s heard it so many times. \u201cHopefully in 10 years\u2019 time, we\u2019ll be closer to 50-50 and women won\u2019t have to do interviews about this any more.\u201d Everything you need to know about sound engineering Sound engineering is the process by which all the elements of audio or a live performance are recorded and/or pieced together to sound as refined as possible: so that\u2019s everything from knowing the acoustics of a room, to deciding on the levels, knowing which microphones to use and where best to place them. Producing was once a very separate role from engineering but, increasingly, it now crosses over. Producers work with the artist on the track in a less technical way, helping to make the artistic choices \u2013 so it\u2019s making the track the best it can be, but on a compositional level. For example, choosing the instrument that might sound best, suggesting a different song structure, and coaxing the best performance out of an artist. Often, sound engineers are also the mixers \u2013 although this too can be a separate job. Mixing is the final stage \u2013 once the recording is finished, the mixer will take the files, or the tape, and create a balanced composition. So, say there were nine microphones recording one guitar, the mixer would have to take these nine different recordings and mix them together, and then \u2013 depending on what the composition calls for \u2013 mix in the other instruments, vocals, etc. They are also in charge of making the choices on volume levels and additional effects. If you\u2019ve watched Netflix documentary The Defiant Ones, you will be aware there was once a time when simply being available at all hours and learning by practising was how you became a sound engineer. Nowadays, things are very different \u2013 in most cases, specific training is required in the appropriate technology and software (Pro Tools, for example), be that in a higher education institution or an apprenticeship scheme. According to PayScale, the average salary for a sound engineer is \u00a325,000 per annum, with stats suggesting the gender divide is now 95% men and 5% women.

It has to be a blend of a human being and technology.\u201d Through thousands of individually made video tutorials, Sparx helps explain concepts and provides an hour of bespoke maths homework for each student every week. \u201cSo if a child is really strong, he or she can explore, while others can use the video to address gaps in their knowledge,\u201d says Hart. She\u2019d like to see more links between industry and schools to inspire pupils and bring the maths curriculum to life. As a young mathematician, careers advisers pushed her towards accountancy \u2013 but, on graduation, she happily discovered her options were far broader. \u201cMaths genuinely creates so many opportunities.\u201d And if teachers could communicate the relevance of trigonometry, algebra, and other mathematical concepts in everyday life, then pupils could be more inspired earlier on, she says. \u201cHow does an architect use maths, for instance? Having someone say why that fractions class could be useful in the future would be so worthwhile.\u201d Download our women in engineering supplement (pdf)",

Ariya Jutanugarn has two majors to her name already: the 2016 British Open and the 2018 US Open. She shot 68 yesterday to close the gap on Green to a single stroke. The defending champion Park Sung-hyun is five behind the leader. Danielle Kang, the 2017 PGA champ, is six back. And also six back is Inbee Park, three times a PGA winner, seven times a major champ, a Hall of Famer and Olympic gold medallist. Throw in Solheim Cup regular Lizette Salas, 2015 PGA runner-up Kim Sei-young, and 20-year-old sensation Nelly Korda, whose length off the tee (see also: Jutanugarn) could be decisive on a long track like Hazeltine, and that\u2019s quite a chasing pack.</p> <p><strong>But enough preamble. </strong>Let\u2019s tee it up.

      "bodyText": "So congratulations to Hannah Green, who joins Yani Tseng (2011), Judy Kimball (1962) and the legendary Mickey Wright (1958 and 1961) as a wire-to-wire winner of the PGA. She held off a strong charge from the field, never relinquishing her lead, and is the deserved winner of the 2019 Women\u2019s PGA Championship. Thanks for reading, and we hope to see you back here in three weeks for the Open at Portrush. Nighty night! -9: Green -8: S Park -6: Reid, Korda -5: Kang, Salas -4: Lee, H Kim, I Park -3: Ryu, L Ko, Khang, Jutanugarn Honourable mention goes to the defending champion Park Sung-hyun, who did everything in her power to keep possession of her title. Nearly. Not quite. But her final-day 68 means there should be no what-ifs; she gave it everything. And hats off to Mel Reid, who tore up Hazeltine with a glorious 66. That\u2019s earned her a share of third, her best finish at a major. Hopefully that\u2019ll spur the 31-year-old from Derby on to greater things. Hannah Green, 2019 PGA champion, gives an emotional interview, her voice cracking with a mixture of ecstasy, relief and a little stunned disbelief. \u201cI\u2019m pretty much speechless. I was really nervous playing the last five holes, and was really happy that I made that last clutch putt, because that was what I was struggling with in the middle of the round. To make the one at the last really is surreal! It\u2019s awesome, I\u2019m just so over the moon. I knew I had to make par, I really didn\u2019t want to play that hole again!\u201d What an up and down from sand to win her maiden major! The pressure had been cranked right up to 11, after defending champion Park Sung-hyun\u2019s birdie on the last, a birdie that had forced Green to wait and do battle with her nerves back down the hole. But she held firm! It would have been so easy to buckle in those circumstances ... just as it would have been easy to give in to fate after that mid-round wobble. On both occasions, she fought back and becomes only the fourth player to win the PGA wire-to-wire. And on a long, difficult track like Hazeltine too! ... makes no mistake! Hannah Green is the 2019 Women\u2019s PGA champion! Her first victory on tour, and it\u2019s a major! She dissolves into the happiest of tears as her friends and compatriots race onto the green and cover her in sticky booze! -9: Green -8: S Park A little right-to-left break from five feet. Green again wastes little time. She steps up and ... Ariya Jutanugarn ends a miserable day with bogey. She never got going, and that\u2019s a 77 for the two-time major winner. She\u2019s -3. Then Lizette Salas nearly drains a long par putt, but she\u2019ll settle for a 72. At -5, she\u2019s tied for fifth, by far her best finish of the season. And so the stage is cleared for Hannah Green. Green wastes no time in jumping into the trap, and splashing out magnificently to five feet! That\u2019s a wonderful result from there, especially in these circumstances. She allows a small smile to play across her face, though it\u2019s clearly a nervous one. She knows nothing\u2019s in the bag yet. Green has found greenside sand three times previously this week. She\u2019s got up and down twice. None of those scrambles were for the title, though. She stands with her arms folded, a study in turmoil, as Salas, having laid up, wedges into the green. She\u2019ll be happy to see her lie in the bunker is pretty good, on flat, freshly raked sand. And there\u2019s a little more green to play with than we thought: maybe 15 feet or so. Not ideal, but if she gets up and down from there, she\u2019ll win the 2019 Women\u2019s PGA Championship. She wouldn\u2019t have wanted to be here back on the tee ... but she\u2019d have sure taken it at the start of the week. Green gets tense and pulls a 6-iron into the bunker at the front left of the green. She needs to get up and down from sand to win the PGA. No biggie. She\u2019s shortsided, too, with very little green to play with. Park Sung-hyun has really turned up the heat on the 23-year-old Aussie, who is battling for her first win on tour ... and her first major. The tension at Hazeltine, as Green takes the long walk up the 72nd, is palpable. Park turns up the pressure on Green! She rolls a perfect right-to-left slider into the cup, and raises a clenched fist in celebration. The roar that greets the defending champion\u2019s birdie will reverberate back up the hole, where Green stands and waits. That\u2019s a 68, and she\u2019s the new clubhouse leader, just a shot behind Green. Par for Korda; she finishes at -6. And Kim Sei-young ends the day with a 75, slipping back to -1. -9: Green (17) -8: S Park (F) Korda sends her approach to 12 feet. Park knocks hers to ten. A chance for the defending champion to move to within a shot and put some real pressure on Green. Back on the tee, the leader smacks a fine drive down the middle. A par, and the PGA is hers. A bogey will do, should Park miss her putt. Inbee Park signs for a 71. She ends the week at -4, and the long wait for major number eight goes on. A par for Danielle Kang, who cards 70 and finishes at -5, alone in sixth place right now. Back down the hole, Nelly Korda and Park Sung-huyn are forced to wait for the best part of ten minutes. And on the tee, Hannah Green is left to wrestle with her nerves. Hey, majors shouldn\u2019t come easy. A huge stroke of good fortune for Park Sung-hyun on 18. She hooks her drive towards trouble down the left. Her ball is surely sailing into deep rough or one of the bunkers. But somehow, despite landing in the thick stuff, the ball takes a massive bounce out to the right, and scampers back onto the fairway! The defending champion isn\u2019t quite done yet - though she must have thought the jig was up as her ball curved off to the left, seemingly taking all of her hopes and dreams with it. Back at the business end of the leader board, Green sends her tee shot safely into 17. No heroics, no drama. Two careful putts and she\u2019ll be going down 18 with a two-shot lead. Meanwhile Salas can consider herself extremely unfortunate not to make the birdie she so desperately needs. Her tee shot was straight at the flag: had it landed one foot further, it would have rolled very close to the cup. But it snagged in the fringe, and the long grass messes with her birdie putt too. She remains at -6. -9: Green (17) -7: S Park (17) -6: Reid (F), Salas (17), Korda (17) Neither Park nor Korda can make their birdie putts. Coming at the hole from different angles, Korda lets her ball slip by on the left, Park misreads and sends her putt off to the right. This is suddenly Hannah Green\u2019s to lose once again. Meanwhile Jimin Kang ends the week at +15, tied for 78th out of 80. As the only club professional to make it to the weekend, she was guaranteed the vase for the low club pro. She lifts it over her head with a smile that mocks the weather. Congratulations to Jimin! Park Sung-hyun and Nelly Korda pepper the flag at 17. They\u2019ll both try to make birdie from less than ten feet. There\u2019s to be no fairytale finish for Megan Khang: a double bogey at 18, the result of driving into a bunker, and she cards 70, finishing at -3. And back on 16, Salas doesn\u2019t hit her birdie putt, but a par keeps her at -6. However that\u2019s three off the lead now, because Green strokes a perfectly paced left-to-right breaker into the cup for birdie, and she\u2019s suddenly got a two-shot lead again! How marvellously she\u2019s responded to that mid-round wobble! -9: Green (16) -7: S Park (16) -6: Reid (F), Salas (16), N Korda (16) Salas fires an arrow into 16 and over the flag. She\u2019ll have a look at birdie from 30 feet coming back. That\u2019s decent, but a little wind will have been taken from her sail as Green sends an even better approach in to 15 feet. Meanwhile on 17, Kang\u2019s tee shot snags in the fringe at the front. Close, though. She\u2019s left with a 12-foot birdie putt, but the fringe compromises her backswing and her effort stops short. She remains at -5 and needs a birdie up the last now. Korda makes her par putt, and she remains two off the lead. Kim Sei-young\u2019s chase for her first major is over, however. Having sat quietly at -5 for much of the day, a triple-bogey seven at 16 has ruined her chances. She tumbles down the standings to -2. Salas splits the middle of 16. Green follows her. Up on the green, Korda nearly chips in from the fringe, but her ball rolls six feet past. A little tester coming back to avoid back-to-back bogeys. First up, though, it\u2019s Park Sung-hyun, who had found the centre of the green with her second and is left with a 30-foot downhill putt for birdie and share of the lead. She judges it to perfection ... almost. One more joule of energy and it was dropping; as it is, the ball dies off to the left. She remains at -7. Green nearly takes advantage of her lucky break on 15. She gently caresses a chip from 80 yards to eight feet, a lovely touch. But her birdie putt shaves the right edge of the hole. So unlucky that didn\u2019t drop, but I guess the gods of golf have balanced things out there. This really is too close to call. A wonderful end to this tournament. Let\u2019s just hope the weather stays away long enough for the players to finish this evening. -8: Green (15) -7: S Park (15) -6: Reid (F), Salas (15), Korda (15) Rain is beginning to fall at Hazeltine. Will the players get round before the bad weather arrives? A fair chance of a play-off, of course, and Lizette Salas throws her hat in the ring by raking in a 40-foot birdie putt at 15. She moves to -6. Meanwhile Danielle Kang birdies the difficult 16th to rise to -5. Mirim Lee can\u2019t make her par putt. A bogey at the last, and she\u2019s signing for a 69. She ends her week at -4. Mel Reid still has sole ownership of the clubhouse lead at -6. A slice of luck for the leader Green as she slices her second at 15. Her ball sails off towards bunkers down the right, but somehow makes it over them and nestles into the semi-rough. On 17, Khang can\u2019t curl in her downhill left-to-right curler for birdie. And up on 18, Mirim Lee\u2019s hopes are extinguished as she finds greenside sand ... from which she fails to hole out for the required birdie. She\u2019ll need to sink a 20-footer to save her par. Birdie for Park Sung-hyun at the par-five 15th! And she swaps places with Nelly Korda, who makes a terrible mess of the hole, sending her third over the back, then failing to commit to a short chip, and finally yipping a three footer. That\u2019s an awful bogey to make after two fine shots down the hole. Back on the tee, Green finds the centre of the fairway, which is just as well, because the defending champion is right on her tail! -8: Green (14) -7: S Park (15) -6: Reid (F), Korda (15) Khang makes her par putt on 16. That\u2019s huge for her, and she remains at -5. Like Lee, she needs another birdie, and she\u2019s given herself a chance on 17, landing her ball 12 feet past the flag. Green can\u2019t make her birdie on 14, but par will suffice in the circumstances. But it\u2019s a three-putt bogey for Jutanugarn. She slips to -4, and her race is run. She\u2019s not got going all day. -8: Green (14) -7: Korda (14) -6: Reid (F), S Park (14) Birdie for Mirim Lee, freshly energised after that eagle at 15. She whips her tee shot at 17 to three feet, and in goes the putt. That\u2019s got her up to -5, and now she\u2019ll be looking for a birdie down the last that\u2019d give her a share of the clubhouse lead with Mel Reid. Green sends a big drive down the middle of 14. Just a wedge left. And the Green of the first three days returns, as she spins a glorious approach to ten feet. She\u2019ll have a great look at a birdie that would go a long way to settling her nerves as she tries to land her maiden major. Khang\u2019s second into 16 isn\u2019t all that, tugged into rough to the left of the green. She\u2019s left in the thick stuff, but does very well to whip a high lob onto the downhill green and get to within eight feet. About the best she could do from such a lie on a slippery green. Big putt coming up, though. Jutanugarn is hanging on in there. Just. Having failed to get up and down at 12, she nearly sheds another shot at 13. But in goes a very awkward six footer for par. Meanwhile Megan Khang is launching a late charge: birdies at 10, 11 and 15 have zipped her up the rankings to -5. A second top-ten finish at a major, to follow last year\u2019s tie for 10th at the US Open, looks a live prospect for the 21-year-old American. Green has been very jittery recently, but she regains her composure marvellously on the par-three 13th. She sends her tee shot into the middle of the green and is a little unfortunate when her ball topples into the rough at the back. She\u2019s left with a delicate little downhll chip, and judges it brilliantly, flopping it onto the green and letting the slope do the work. Her ball gently comes to a halt next to the hole. A fine scramble to save par, and maintain her one-shot lead over Korda. Mel Reid\u2019s best-of-week mark lasted all of two minutes. Last year\u2019s runner-up Nasa Hataoka guides in a right-to-left 30-footer for birdie, her seventh of the day on an unblemished card. That\u2019s a 65 for the 20-year-old from Japan, to go alongside last year\u2019s PGA Sunday 64! She ends the week at -2. Shame about that opening round of 76. Mel Reid finishes with birdie at 18! She rakes in a 30-footer, celebrating with her putter in the air before it drops. She gave that a good rattle; she wasn\u2019t in the mood for any what-ifs. No leaving that short. A sensational round! The 31-year-old from Derby is signing her name to a best-of-week 66. And she\u2019s posted a clubhouse lead that could quite easily earn a play-off, because Green doesn\u2019t hit her chip from the front of 12, or the long par putt she leaves herself, and that\u2019s another shot gone. -8: Green (12) -7: Korda (12) -6: Reid (F), S Kim (12), S Park (12) -5: H Kim (14), I Park (13), Salas (12) Jutanugarn (12) Mirim Lee isn\u2019t quite out of this yet. She\u2019s missed the cut in her last four majors, but it looks as though she\u2019ll end that miserable run with a high finish here. She\u2019s just chipped in from 100 yards at the par-five 15th for eagle, and it whisks her up the standings to -4. A strong finish over the closing three holes, plus a stumble from the leaders, and you never know. And on 12, neither Green nor Jutanugarn can reach the green from the thick rough. Good luck predicting how this is going to pan out. It was looking like a shoo-in for Green not so long ago. It doesn\u2019t look that way now. Trouble for both Jutanugarn and Green on the 12th, as they spray their tee shots into the long stuff down the left of the hole. Up on the green, the defending champ Park Sung-hyun leaves a long putt ten feet short. A dreadful misjudgement that costs the South Korean a shot. Korda meanwhile leaves a 20-foot birdie effort short, too, and a chance to move within one of the lead is gone. The putts just aren\u2019t dropping for Salas. This time her ball stays stubbornly high on the left, and she remains at -5. Jutanugarn meanwhile hits a dreadful chip eight feet past the flag, and she can\u2019t make the one coming back. A bogey on a hole tailor-made for her power. She\u2019s not birdied it all week! The 11th is potentially costing her this tournament. Mind you, Green misses her par putt too, and I wonder if the nerves are really kicking in. That\u2019s three short-ish putts missed in a row. Throw in her wild driving, and the mishit with the hybrid, and it\u2019s looking a bit shaky for Green all of a sudden, despite her remaining in a two-shot lead. Closing out a major championship isn\u2019t easy. -9: Green (11) -7: S Park (11), Korda (11) -6: S Kim (11), Jutanugarn (11) Jutanugarn, concerned, with the green sloping away from her, doesn\u2019t commit to a splash out of the bunker. Her ball snags in the second cut around the green. She\u2019s now got a task to get up and down for par. Green meanwhile doesn\u2019t get her chip close, a poor effort bundled up to six feet, very missable in these pressurised circumstances. Green gets the hybrid out, and mishits it. The ball squirts out of the rough and scampers down the fairway, not the worst result considering. Her third lands right by the flag, but she\u2019s imparted no spin and it scampers over the back of the green. She\u2019ll have a 30-foot putt from the fringe for birdie. Most likely she\u2019ll be escaping with par. Jutanugarn meanwhile crashes two 3-woods down the hole, and she\u2019s in a greenside bunker for two. Salas, not out of this yet at -5, is on in regulation, with a 15-foot putt for her birdie. A spot of bother for Green at the par-five 11th, as she hooks her tee shot into the thick rough on the left. She\u2019s 74th out of 80 players for driving accuracy right now. Given she\u2019s three clear of the field, that\u2019s testament to the power of her short game. Up on the green, last year\u2019s champion Park Sung-hyun gets up and down from sand to move into a share of second. This is a staunch defence of her title. Meanwhile her playing partner Nelly Korda misreads an eight footer for birdie, failing to factor in a gentle left-to-right curl. -10: Green (10) -7: S Park (11), Korda (11), Jutanugarn (10) Reid cuts the corner of the dogleg at 16 with a fine drive, then spins an iron to 15 feet. She\u2019s left with a straight uphill putt, but fails to hit it. A great chance to move to -6 spurned. She swishes the air with her putter in frustration, knowing full well that every opportunity is so precious now, if she\u2019s to apply any scoreboard pressure on Green from the clubhouse. She remains -5. Salas is so close to making her birdie putt from 25 feet. Her star-spangled Titleist slides by on the right, one dimple away from dropping. She gnaws on a nail in theatrical frustration. She remains five behind Green, who can\u2019t convert her birdie chance. The iron in deserved better. But she remains three clear of Jutanugarn, who quietly pars. Green\u2019s approach play has been wonderful all week, and at 10 she arrows another one at the flag. A 7-iron from 150 yards to ten feet. She\u2019ll have a good look at birdie. Salas and Jutanugarn both find the green in regulation, but their birdie putts will be rather more speculative. Another birdie for Mel Reid! This one comes at 15, and she\u2019s -5 for both the tournament and her round. She\u2019ll be cursing that second-day 76. Without that, a maiden major could have been on the cards. As things stand, she\u2019s most likely a little too far back. But if she posts a score, and the weather closes in, you never know. -10: Green (9) -7: Korda (10), Jutanugarn (9) -6: S Park (10), S Kim (10) -5: Reid (15), H Kim (11), Kang (10), I Park (10), Salas (9) Green is going round in the last group with Jutanugarn and Lizette Salas. The 29-year-old Salas isn\u2019t the longest of hitters, so she does well to keep up with her partners as they all crash drives down the middle of 10. She\u2019s level par for her round today, after bogey at 5 and birdie at 8, and is -5 overall. Salas is looking for another high finish at the PGA; she tied for eighth last year. A first misstep today by the leader. Green\u2019s putter has been hot all week, but it suddenly cools on 9 and a ten-footer for par slips by. That\u2019s only her fourth bogey all week. Not an ideal time to record it, as she reaches the back nine on major-championship Sunday ... when anything can happen. -10: Green (9) -7: Korda (9), Jutanugarn (9) Yet another birdie for Nasa Hataoka! This one at 5 brings her up to -1 overall. Pars all the way in, and she\u2019s shooting a 66 that\u2019d go along very nicely with last year\u2019s final-day 64. Bogey for Ariya Jutanugarn at the par-three 8th, and this is beginning to look like Hannah Green\u2019s tournament to lose. Green pars, and her lead is now four. Still, major championships don\u2019t really begin until the back nine on Sunday, and the leaders are approaching the turn now. Inbee Park also dropped a stroke on 8 and slipped to -4; her chances of an eighth major this week look pretty slim now. -11: Green (8) -7: Korda (8), Jutanugarn (8) Pajaree Anannarukarn is making a very impressive major-championship debut. The 19-year-old Thai - younger sister of 2018 LA Open winner Moriya Anannarukarn - has stated her ambition to crack the world top ten, and she\u2019s going about things the right way in her rookie year. Birdies at 1, 2 and now 11 have whisked her up the leader board to -4. She\u2019s just inside the top ten. No let-up from Hannah Green at the top of the leader board! She extends her lead over Ariya Jutanugarn to three, with a birdie at the par-five 7th. Jutanugarn (who has parred the first seven holes) and Lizette Salas (who dropped a shot at 5) are the only players inside the top ten not to be under par for their rounds today. It\u2019s surprising that Jutanugarn isn\u2019t taking advantage of her length off the tee, but she\u2019s making no in-roads yet. -11: Green (7) -8: Jutanugarn (7) -7: Korda (7) Nasa Hataoka doesn\u2019t half like the final round of the PGA. Last year she shot a sensational Sunday 64 at Kemper Lakes, a round that hauled her into a three-way play-off with Park Sung-hyun and Ryu So-yeon. She lost out to Park by a shot, but it was a decent day\u2019s work nonetheless. This year something similarly stunning could be afoot: she\u2019s five under for her round through 13, having birdied 11, 15, 17, 1 and now 3. There\u2019ll be no surge to the play-off this year, though, as she\u2019s only level par overall, stuck behind the eight-ball all week after an opening round of 76. But she\u2019s turning a bang-average week into a much better one. Kim Hyo-joo started her major-championship career with a bang, shooting 61 (!) in the first round of the 2014 Evian Championship as a 19-year-old (!!). She held on to win that tournament, and has continued to perform well in the big ones, having since recorded top-ten finishes in all the other majors, the best of those being last year\u2019s play-off loss to Ariya Jutanugarn at the US Open. She\u2019s going along very nicely today, too, hitting the turn in 33 strokes after birdies at 4, 5 and 9. She\u2019s currently tied for sixth at -5. -10: Green (6) -8: Jutanugarn (6) -7: Korda (7) -6: S Kim (7), S Park (7) -5: H Kim (9), Kang (7), I Park (7) -4: Reid (12), Salas (6) Nelly Korda\u2019s length should see her right around Hazeltine, one of the longest courses on the LPGA Tour. The weather\u2019s not been great, and with soft fairways and thick rough, it\u2019s playing even longer than usual. Korda is accordingly making hay while the sun doesn\u2019t shine: birdies at 5 and now 7 have moved her to within three of the leader Green at -7. The biggest mover so far today: England\u2019s Mel Reid. The 31-year-old from Derby doesn\u2019t have a great record in the majors, with a tie for ninth at the 2015 British Open her only notable finish. Last year\u2019s PGA saw her finish in a tie for 60th. But this week is suddenly promising a lot more. It\u2019s been eventful from the get-go: she started out bogey-birdie-bogey-birdie-birdie. Since that loopy run she\u2019s added more birdies at 7, 9 and now 11, and she\u2019s -4 both for her round and the championship. The players have gone out a little earlier than expected today, the PGA desperate to avoid some incoming inclement weather. They\u2019ve teed off in threesomes, the leading bunch going off at 1, those further down the leader board starting at 10. All of which means there\u2019s already been plenty of action at the top of the leader board. Most importantly, Hannah Green has extended her lead over Ariya Jutanugarn at the top thanks to an early birdie at 2. But some of the pack behind are making a move: Kim Sei-young, Park Sung-hyun, Danielle Kang and Inbee Park are all two under for their rounds so far, nibbling into the advantage Green held over them after 54 holes. -10: Green (5) -8: Jutanugarn (5) -6: Kim (6), S Park (6), Korda (6) -5: Kang (6), I Park (6) Welcome to our coverage of the final day of the second-oldest major in women\u2019s golf: the Women\u2019s PGA Championship. Hannah Green is chasing her first major, and indeed her first victory on Tour. The 22-year-old Aussie is in good shape for it, leading at Hazeltine on Saturday evening after rounds of 68, 68 and 70. That put her atop this 54-hole leaderboard: -9: Hannah Green -8: Ariya Jutanugarn -5: Lizette Salas, Nelly Korda -4: Kim Sei-young, Park Sung-hyun -3: Danielle Kang, Inbee Park All good. But there are plenty of threats lurking just over her shoulder - and with major-winning know-how. Ariya Jutanugarn has two majors to her name already: the 2016 British Open and the 2018 US Open. She shot 68 yesterday to close the gap on Green to a single stroke. The defending champion Park Sung-hyun is five behind the leader. Danielle Kang, the 2017 PGA champ, is six back. And also six back is Inbee Park, three times a PGA winner, seven times a major champ, a Hall of Famer and Olympic gold medallist. Throw in Solheim Cup regular Lizette Salas, 2015 PGA runner-up Kim Sei-young, and 20-year-old sensation Nelly Korda, whose length off the tee (see also: Jutanugarn) could be decisive on a long track like Hazeltine, and that\u2019s quite a chasing pack. But enough preamble. Let\u2019s tee it up. It\u2019s on!",

Normally, you\u2019d either have the video official make the decision, or you give the on field official immediate access to a screen. But Fifa, for reasons known only to themselves, have created an unnecessary two-stage system which only serves to add an extra two or three minutes to every controversial moment (as well as ending up with a decision being made from only one screen, inside the ground, which completely goes against the principle of having a bank of monitors in a separate quiet location).<br><br>\u201cIf it was all dealt with more promptly, more logically, I feel there\u2019d<br>be a fair bit less anger, even with the odd dubious result.

It was so far over you could probably have seen it clearly in from the very back row at the other end of the stadium. That\u2019s not to criticise goal-line technology, that has been a quick, decisive, and good addition. But other terrible mistake that really should have been spotted by the match officials just falling well below the required standards have led to the call for VAR. Supposedly it\u2019s to correct the clear and obvious error, the howler (like the DRS in cricket was originally meant to do). But that is just making up for officials failing to perform.

Karchouai replaces her. 116 mins: Brazil are struggling to find enough energy to get a crucial equaliser. 114 mins: Diani almost seals France\u2019s progression. She bursts into the box and fires a shot towards the top corner but Barbara palms it wide, not that the officials spot it. Peter Oh says: \u201cIf this score holds (I have family in Brazil watching, so I do not want it to hold), it will be a Henry with a decisive France goal to knock Brazil out of the World Cup.

I\u2019m still mad at Roberto Carlos for pulling up his socks instead of marking Thierry Henry.\u201d 112 mins: The France fans are trying to keep their players running with a slow hand, Icelandic clap. 110 mins: A lot of tired limbs out there ... 108 mins: Can Brazil bounce back from this? Diani wins a free-kick on the right. Majri whips it in for players to attack and Henry is the one who gets on the end of it and diverts the ball home from six yards. More football. I am about to enter my eighth straight hour of MBMing. I might be delirious about VAR. We are heading for penalties, aren\u2019t we? 105 mins: What a clearance! Debinha breaks the offside trap, gets into the box and toe pokes the ball beyond the \u2018keeper but Mbock Bathy Nka sees where it is going and clears it off the line. 104 mins: A corner is lifted onto Diani\u2019s head who powers an effort towards goal but it\u2019s straight at Barbara. 102 mins: France have a free-kick in a dangerous position but Majri sends it straight out for a goal kick. Ruth Purdie wants a red for Geyse: \u201cThat\u2019s a red card there Will. She knew what she was doing and left her foot in there.\u201d 100 mins: Thiney lifts a corner beyond the back post which Henry sends back into danger but no one in a white shirt can get a crucial final touch and it bounces behind. 98 mins: A ball is lifted over the France defence for Geyse to chase. The substitute is quick but the goalkeeper gets there first to claim, although the Brazilian catches Bouhaddi and she requires treatment. 96 mins: Cristiane is carried off. Good work by Majri on the left results in her lifting a cross to the back post but the ball bounces kindly for the Brazil defence who clear. 94 mins: Cristiane tries to shoot from downtown but the effort of whacking it from the halfway has knacked her hamstring. She is down and not getting up anytime soon. Needless to say, she didn\u2019t score. 92 mins: A quiet start to extra-time. I have been reminded of my Tony Cascarino anecdote, though, so will tell that at the end of the game. Jeremy Hurley has some advice for us all: \u201cPeople have such short memories if all the dodgy goals that were given before the introduction of VAR. Its like reading an echo chamber, VAR VAr Var var va v.......watch the game and stop moaning.\u201d Thirty minutes more you say? Justin Kavanagh on VAR: \u201cThe future of football might involve an offside official whose only purpose will be to deliver the bad news to the players that the VAR lads have found the striker to be offside\u2026again. If this newfangled VAR stuff had been around in Filippo Inzaghi\u2019s day, every game would have taken about four hours.\u201d I\u2019d hope not but England wouldn\u2019t scare me at the moment. Extra-time is required. Mine\u2019s a pint. 90+4 mins: Debinha gets the ball into the box to Beatriz who stretches to shoot but she cannot control the shot and it flies wide. 90+2 mins: Gauvin chases the ball into the channel but her cross into the box is snaffled by Barbara. Marta tries to get away from Henry but the France skipper stops that with a tap on the ankle. 90 mins: Five minutes added on. Toby Rutland is in: \u201cI\u2019ll join you and Paul Connoly for that pint, and would argue that the referee thought that could have been a penalty but bottled it and waited to see what the VAR said. She even stopped play for the Brazilian defender who was not at all injured, was that to give the VAR guys some more time?? Var worked well for the Brazil goal tbf\u201d I think anyone could have spotted the offside without the use of cameras. 89 mins: A deep cross is headed on by defender Diani and lands at Marta\u2019s feet but she fails to get a shot away before being closed down. Mary Waltz says: \u201cWell, my pre game and half time predictions were completely off the mark. But in the grand tradition of our current political leaders I will reject responsibility for my words and blame it all on the EU, fake news, and the French measles style kit.\u201d 87 mins: NO GOAL! The ball is played through to Tamires who is an acre of space. She has so much space for a reason: she is a mile offside. Regardless she puts the ball in the back of the net and celebrates before the flag goes up. VAR confirms it very quickly, which shows how far off she was. 85 mins: Cristiane\u2019s quick feet gets her beyond Diani who gains revenge by taking her down. Andressinha whacks the free-kick but it bounces perfectly for the \u2018keeper to take. 83 mins: Beatriz cuts across Torrent and gets booked. 80 mins: Santos gets done by Le Sommer on the left and then cleans her out as she gives away the foul. She is not booked but does end up with cramp. Bussaglia\u2019s free-kick lands in the \u2018keeper\u2019s hands. 78 mins: Henry spins away from a defender with ease but her cross is too close to Barbara who still requires two attempts to claim the ball. 76 mins: Paul Connolly agrees with me, let\u2019s go for a pint: \u201cI\u2019d support your argument in the 70th minute. Katheleen went right through Gauvin\u2019s back. \u201cI must say I\u2019m disappointed by the quality of refereeing in this tournament.\u201d 74 mins: Diani puts the ball past Tamires who then takes her down but the referee adjudges it not to be a foul. Down the other end Debinha whacks a low drive from 20 yards but it\u2019s straight down the \u2018keeper\u2019s throat. Paul Rhys emails: \u201cSo a great goal from Brazil gets all the excitement sucked out of it by a VAR call. Yes it went in their favour...but is the line-o more inclined to raise her flag, \u201cjust to be safe\u201d, because she knows she has VAR as a safety net? It was a clear no-interference offside. The whole system is making me want to stop watching the top competitions because even the threat of VAR robs goals of that joyous, unadulterated outburst of emotion.\u201d 72 mins: The free-kick is lifted to the edge of the six-yard box where Le Sommer misjudges it and heads wide when completely free. She might have been a few inches offside, anyway. 70 mins: Katheleen goes down with a sore shoulder after challenging Gauvin in the box for a header but gets nowhere near it. I would argue it\u2019s a foul ... but no one else does. Diani breaks through a couple of challenges but Formiga then just cuts her down in full flow. Needless to say, she is booked. 68 mins: The fans are keeping the France players going but some are looking a little tired here. 66 mins: Majri tries to send in a cross but Santos gets in her way to stop it. A cross from the left is pulled back into the path of Thaisa who angles a shot into the bottom corner but the referee rules it out, claiming Devinha was offside before receiving the ball. The forward was definitely onside and it goes upstairs for the video guys to confirm it is a goal. 62 mins: Le Sommer picks up the ball on the left, cuts into the box and fires a wicked shot at goal but it smashes into teammates Gauvin and flies wide. It looked like that was set for the bottom corner, too. The referee was not ranked ... 60 mins: All pretty quiet in Le Havre at the moment. 58 mins: Sorry, I lied. Bouhaddi tipped the header onto the bar. Please accept apologies as it was a great save. France send in a corner which Barbara comes to get but is nowhere to be seen as it flies over her head. Renard gets a touch on it but not in the right direction and Brazil clear. 56 mins: OFF THE BAR! Marta swings in a free-kick from the left, which Cristiane rises highest to head towards goal but the ball bounces off the crossbar with Bouhaddi helpless. Hubert offers his VAR rules: I\u2019ve finally made my mind up about VAR. I hate it. I hate it unless three specific rules changes come in with it: A handball in the box is only a penalty if the contact is made from a ball struck &gt; 5 feet from the defender\u2019s hand. Offside is only awarded when a majority of an offensive player\u2019s body is ahead of the last defender\u2019s body part closest to the goal Keepers are allowed a one meter line/box in which to move on a penalty. A keeper has to be allowed to make a slight step in order to cover the corners. One cannot leap from a standing stop to either post. Try it sometime. You can with a cross-step but there is no time for a cross-step 54 mins: Le Havre is bouncing as the fans celebrate the goal and the fact we weren\u2019t put through the trauma of VAR once more. Stunning work from Diani down the right flank and she leaves the full-back to eat dust thanks to a quick turn coupled with pace before putting in a perfect, low cross for Gauvin to slide in. No need for VAR here. 51 mins: Asseyi drives across the pitch, taking a couple of Brazilians out of the game before laying it off to Le Sommer who slices the ball wide. USA take on Spain in the last 16 ... 49 mins: Marta chips a free-kick into the box but a French defender comes out on top to head clear. Earlier Varce 47 mins: A lovely turn from Le Sommer but that\u2019s about it so far. Peep! Peep! Peep! Another 45 minutes of football versus VAR awaits. Jacqui Oatley says ... Not for me, Clive. Cnoyes says: \u201cWas it just my lying eyes or were Brazil the better team in that opening half? Controlling the tempo of the game beautifully with tough play and careful passing in midfield. Did France end that half without a single meaningful shot on goal? So much for tipping them as favourites.\u201d I am not sure they are controlling it but they are certainly stopping France from getting going. Half-time reading from Rob Marriott: \u201cQuite apart from whether or not the decisions are right, it\u2019s become increasingly frustrating to see the referee summoned to a screen - after the fully-qualified refs with the dozen monitors have tried to reach a decision - almost every time. I\u2019m sure that VAR wasn\u2019t originally intended to work that way, that involving the on field ref was supposed to be an occasional last resort, and I\u2019m also fairly sure that it was indeed only occasional when the technology first came in. \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any other sport that takes this approach. Normally, you\u2019d either have the video official make the decision, or you give the on field official immediate access to a screen. But Fifa, for reasons known only to themselves, have created an unnecessary two-stage system which only serves to add an extra two or three minutes to every controversial moment (as well as ending up with a decision being made from only one screen, inside the ground, which completely goes against the principle of having a bank of monitors in a separate quiet location). \u201cIf it was all dealt with more promptly, more logically, I feel there\u2019d be a fair bit less anger, even with the odd dubious result. Nobody enjoys the endless waiting.\u201d Ruth Purdue offers some analysis: \u201cBrazil are fouling like City do. Do it before the brilliant French attack can get any fluency. \u201cIn other new Marta needs to take fewer touches and play quicker. She has runner ahead of her everytime.\u201d VAR VAR VAR VAR VAR VAR VAR VAR VAR VAR. Still goalless. 45+4 mins: Majri gets the ball in space on the edge of the area but rushes her shot and smashes it high and wide. Abhijato Sensarma says: \u201cI hence declare that every goal scored is a \u2018Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Goal\u2019 in a football match involving VAR. The goal has been scored and not been scored simultaneously; it remains in this dual state until the referee - the ultimate observer on the field - has made his decision. At this point, the goal enters a singular state of existence - it either existed, or never did, even though it certainly did as well as did not before the observation was made in the reality of all others. \u201cVAR decisions boggle the mind, boggle the spirit, and transcend logic. Do I dare say these decision make sense yet don\u2019t simultaneously?\u201d 45+2 mins: Tamires is booked for a cynical challenge, wrapping her legs around Asseyi despite already being on the floor. Matt Cast makes a bold claim: \u201cThis is a really cynical performance from Brazil in terms of fouls and making the most of any contact. I think they\u2019ve now committed more fouls than Cameroon did in the first half v England...\u201d 45 mins: Six minutes added on. Cheers VAR. Scott Bassett has a solution: \u201cThat was a 50:50 for me. The keeper definitely did not have control. Maybe the striker\u2019s hand touched the ball as it was bundled in but it\u2019s another case of \u201cunnatural position suspicion,\u201d which leads me to the question, what exactly is the law and what is the current guidance on how to apply it? Answer: who the eff knows anymore? It was extremely harsh to disallow that. The only answer seems to be detachable arms.\u201d 44 mins: Cristiane breaks into the box from the left, shooting from a tight angle, with the shot repelled by the \u2018keeper\u2019s feet. Bouhaddi comes to claim the corner but is given a free-kick after the dropping the ball without really being under pressure. Maybe the referee is just soft on goalkeepers. David Wall emails: \u201cThat\u2019s a good point (32 minutes), i think the issue has always been that the officials in particular games weren\u2019t/ aren\u2019t good enough (however high the general standard is). It was Frank Lampard\u2019s no -given goal against Germany in 2010 that convinced Blatter to accept goal-line technology, but how the linesman on the day missed that was the real issue. It was so far over you could probably have seen it clearly in from the very back row at the other end of the stadium. That\u2019s not to criticise goal-line technology, that has been a quick, decisive, and good addition. But other terrible mistake that really should have been spotted by the match officials just falling well below the required standards have led to the call for VAR. Supposedly it\u2019s to correct the clear and obvious error, the howler (like the DRS in cricket was originally meant to do). But that is just making up for officials failing to perform. A better, easier solution is to put more money and resources into training more, better officials.\u201d 42 mins: Fouls all over the shop here. Not much football in between. More actual reason: 40 mins: Drew Goldie brings reason: \u201cA few years ago a penalty was awarded against a goalkeeper who saved a shot in a one-on-one, but it was deemed a foul because he had followed through and smacked into the centre forward. Even though he\u2019d got his shot away and wasn\u2019t impeded in the slightest. \u201cThis one presumably was chalked off because the French player\u2019s challenge followed through on the goalkeeper, and the goalie fluffing it isn\u2019t relevant. \u201cIt\u2019s the rules that are daft, more than VAR. At least, I think that\u2019s what just happened.\u201d 38 mins: Marta does her best to outfox Torrent but the France defender sticks to her task and puts the ball out for a corner. Marta takes the corner and finds Cristiane whose header loops into the goalkeeper\u2019s hands. 36 mins: Renard goes into the book for a challenge on Devinha. The French centre-back caught her on the knee with studs, which is not great. The Brazil players were asking for a card from the start and got their wish quite quickly. Toby Rutland is not happy: \u201cWhy am I sending this? Why do I care? I have no interest in this game, it\u2019s on in the background. Yet I need to get off my chest how angry I am with Fifa and the plastic officials in their stupid studio, disallowing perfectly good goals (or allowing obviously offside goals) and ruining football.\u201d 34 mins: Tamires sends a pass through but Bouhaddi is quickly off her line and clears the immediate danger before Brazil are penalised for an offside. I think it was a 50:50 and the forward won it. But who knows anymore? Others think the issue was a handball so it certainly isn\u2019t clear. 32 mins: Is the issue that officials just aren\u2019t good enough? Have they not been trained sufficiently? Barbara now being booed by the home fans, one assumes that she invented VAR. Lourens van Krimpen says: \u201cVAR is the end of the enjoyment of the game. If this goes on like this lots of people will turn their back. I for one am on the verge.\u201d 30 mins: I still do not know what the goal was disallowed for. This is just silly now. Still scrappy on the pitch. David Wall emails: \u201cEveryone seems to be anticipating a France - USA quarter final after their respective last 16 games and it\u2019s true that would be a super match up, but isn\u2019t that an extreme case of premature chicken counting? Both Brazil and Spain are pretty decent sides, well capable of upsetting the odds, so you could very plausibly see one or both of the favourites miss out. As i write this France have just scored but there is still a way to go.\u201d 28 mins: VARCE. This is idiotic, no? 26 mins: The goal goes to VAR. The claim is Gauvin took the ball out of Barbara\u2019s hands but the goalkeeper certainly did not have control of the ball when it hit the France player. If this is overturned we should end it all. Oh, it is disallowed. This is silly. The ball ends up in the back of the net after a cross from Diani on the right bounces off the Gauvin\u2019s and into the back of the net. Barbara came to get it but did not claim it. Both \u2018keeper and scorer end up on the floor in pain but that is the opening goal as the celebrating France players prove. Oh but it is not. 22 mins: A little bit scrappy at the moment in Le Havre. Plenty of intent but just lacking a touch of quality. 20 mins: There is a good tempo to this game but still waiting for any real moments of quality. 18 mins: Mary Waltz on kits: \u201cThe answer to the question on France\u2019s bizarre kit design. The designer is obviously an anti-vaxer sending out a message to their fellow travellers.\u201d 16 mins: Debinha cuts in from the left and drills a shot from 20 yards but it\u2019s diverted wide by a defender in white. Marta swings in the cross but the goalkeeper does well to cling on when under pressure in the box. Hubert\u2019s been in touch: \u201cI know this puts me in the minority but for the life of me I can\u2019t reason why. Brazil, to my eye, are vastly superior to France save for the dubious edge of home field. I\u2019m not a gambling man (hence the roof over my head) but I\u2019d take Brazil minus 1.5 goals without a slightest shiver of doubt.\u201d 14 mins: Henry aims a cross into the box but it\u2019s deflected straight to Barbara in the Brazil. 12 mins: A free-kick 30 yards fro goal is laid off to Henry who thwacks well over the bar. Charles Antaki asks: \u201cThe football looks good already but in the early stages, trivia worries come to the fore: if Brazil are in first choice strip, why not the blue shorts and white socks? And why are France in shirts that, in close-up, look like a 12-year old\u2019s pyjamas?\u201d Sell more kits? 10 mins: Marta gains control of the ball 25 yards from goal, wriggles through a couple of defenders to earn enough space to fire a shot off but she drags it wide from the edge of the box. 8 mins: Brazil dive into a few last-ditch tackles to stop France making it into the box and then clear the pressure. France looking the more confident side early on. 6 mins: Henry does well to dispossess the full-back in the corner and wins another set-piece when her latest cross is turned behind. Barbara fists it to the edge of her own box. She is looking to dominate the box tonight. 4 mins: Henry earns a corner for France after he cross on the turn is deflected out. Barbara comes to claim the corner and gathers the ball at the second time of acting. 2 mins: Plenty of clapping in the stands from the home fans but not much happening on the pitch. Let\u2019s get ready to rumble! The anthems are done and dusted and we\u2019re pretty much ready to go. Abhijato Sensarma asks: (1) Who is the favourite today according to you and/or most pundits? Alex Scott. (2) Is VAR winning the Golden Boot this year? Probably (3) Have your fingers not suffered enough? Yes Hope Solo on pressure ... This game is live on BBC Four which means it\u2019s a high brow, cultural experience. Do you take requests? Silly rules. If this game is anything about England v Cameroon then I might not survive the night. Let\u2019s hope for a nice 2-0 win. Mary Waltz emails: \u201cFrance has the depth of quality that should overwhelm Brazil. Can Marta discover the fountain of youth and pretend that it\u2019s 20010 and upset mighty Le Bleu? Should be fun.\u201d I just did the MBM on this madness, too ... Not a great omen ... A bit on the France coach ... France: Bouhaddi, Renard, Torrent, Henry, Le Sommer, Majri, Diani, Gauvin, Bussaglia, Asseyi, Mbock Bathy Nka Brazil: Barbara, Thaisa, Tamires, Formiga, Debinha, Marta, Cristiane, L Santos, Kathellen, Ludmila, Monica Good evening! The hosts are looking to take one step closer to achieving the dream of winning their own tournament. They picked up maximum points in the group, with a little helping hand from VAR but they will be rightly confident heading into this game. Brazil won two out of three in their group, losing a dramatic game to Australia in between. Their results saw them finish only third, which they will not have enjoyed considering the opposition. They possess Marta, who is back fit and makes a huge difference to the Brazil side. Will France fall to the Brazilians? It will be fascinating to find out.",

But with Chelsea banned from registering players for the next two transfer windows the 21-year-old says the punishment may work in his favour.</p> <p>\u201cThis year is the most important year for us. It is now or never,\u201d said the striker who scored 25 goals for Villa this season. \u201cThere will never be a better time to play the youngsters. Of course the transfer ban is probably not what the club wanted but for us it is exciting. I am excited and I am sure the rest of the players are.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a great chance for us young players so we must get our heads down in training and go for it at Chelsea. I have already been talking to the club about pre-season. I\u2019m going to have a couple of weeks and then come back hitting the ground running. There is no better time for a young player to be at Chelsea. I am going to give it my all. With a new manager coming in there is no better time to show what I am made of in pre-season. I am just buzzing at the thought of the new season.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"655bce6f043819fbfebdd2a508a84a4ff1d482c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/655bce6f043819fbfebdd2a508a84a4ff1d482c9/0_127_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tammy Abraham says if Frank Lampard became Chelsea\u2019s new manager \u2018there is no better guy to play under\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tammy Abraham says if Frank Lampard became Chelsea\u2019s new manager \u2018there is no better guy to play under\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Walton/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Abraham believes the transfer ban could prompt a different approach from Chelsea who, while flourishing at youth level, have been slow to promote homegrown talent to the senior ranks. The striker believes a production line into the first team will create a stronger bond with supporters.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe it will change. Hopefully. Chelsea has always had a great academy. They have lacked playing them and taking them to the next level. You see the likes of Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who on the borderline have done that. We have excellent players still there and coming through who are still Chelsea players so fingers crossed if it all goes well it changes the mindset. I got thousands of messages from Chelsea fans on Instagram saying play him, play him. It is nice to have that behind you, knowing the supporters have your back. They believe in you as well. Clearly I was doing something right.

      "bodyText": "Tammy Abraham has said Chelsea\u2019s transfer ban represents a glorious opportunity for the club\u2019s academy prospects and next season will be \u201cnow or never\u201d for him to break into the first team. The England Under-21 forward is set to start the final game of a poor European Championship for Aidy Boothroyd\u2019s side against Croatia on Monday. He will then take only a fortnight\u2019s holiday before starting pre-season training at Chelsea in a bid to impress Frank Lampard or whoever succeeds Maurizio Sarri as manager. Abraham has spent the past three seasons on loan, at Bristol City, Swansea and Aston Villa, and has made only two first-team appearances for his boyhood club. But with Chelsea banned from registering players for the next two transfer windows the 21-year-old says the punishment may work in his favour. \u201cThis year is the most important year for us. It is now or never,\u201d said the striker who scored 25 goals for Villa this season. \u201cThere will never be a better time to play the youngsters. Of course the transfer ban is probably not what the club wanted but for us it is exciting. I am excited and I am sure the rest of the players are. \u201cThere is a great chance for us young players so we must get our heads down in training and go for it at Chelsea. I have already been talking to the club about pre-season. I\u2019m going to have a couple of weeks and then come back hitting the ground running. There is no better time for a young player to be at Chelsea. I am going to give it my all. With a new manager coming in there is no better time to show what I am made of in pre-season. I am just buzzing at the thought of the new season.\u201d Abraham believes the transfer ban could prompt a different approach from Chelsea who, while flourishing at youth level, have been slow to promote homegrown talent to the senior ranks. The striker believes a production line into the first team will create a stronger bond with supporters. \u201cMaybe it will change. Hopefully. Chelsea has always had a great academy. They have lacked playing them and taking them to the next level. You see the likes of Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who on the borderline have done that. We have excellent players still there and coming through who are still Chelsea players so fingers crossed if it all goes well it changes the mindset. I got thousands of messages from Chelsea fans on Instagram saying play him, play him. It is nice to have that behind you, knowing the supporters have your back. They believe in you as well. Clearly I was doing something right. Fingers crossed it all happens.\u201d Lampard is Chelsea\u2019s preferred candidate to replace Sarri as head coach and the Europa League winners hope to make more progress in taking him from Derby County this week. Abraham believes he and the assistant Jody Morris would be ideal appointments for Chelsea\u2019s academy players. \u201cI believe in myself and there is no better guy to play under as well,\u201d the striker said. \u201cSomeone you have grown up watching, who has been at Chelsea for ever. He knows about me as well \u2013 I played against his team in the play-off final. I am pretty sure he knows all about me. And Jody as well. I have obviously been coached by Jody in the younger age groups. So it is positive, it is all positive.\u201d The situation is not so positive in San Marino, where England play their final group C game already eliminated from the Euros following error-strewn defeats by France and Romania . Croatia will be the final under-21 international for Abraham and several older members of Boothroyd\u2019s squad. Abraham said: \u201cIt is quite sad really. Demarai [Gray] and I were reminiscing in our room last night. This is our last under-21 tournament and it is only just hitting us now really. You still believe in your head that you are young. Sad as well because we wanted to finish with a win. Most of us know we have fantastic players. I believe most of us can go back to our clubs and be banging on the door of the first teams. \u201cIt is sad how we were in that situation with France and down to 10 men. All the nonsense that can happen in football happened to us, all the bad luck. We will learn from this. The positives are there is still the first team [to aim for], the next step we can try to get to. Hopefully it is not the last time we play together.\u201d",

The remaining three are the children of the foreign fighter Yasin Rizvic and his wife, Fauzia Khamal Bacha, who joined Isis in 2014. It is the first instance of Australian children of foreign fighters being rescued from the northern Syrian camps. The eight children crossed into Iraqi Kurdistan at 3:30pm local time on Sunday into the care of Australian officials, and the Guardian has been asked not to disclose further geographical information for security reasons. All eight children are headed for Australia, but the Sharrouf children\u2019s return will be delayed because of the impending birth of Sharrouf\u2019s 17-year-old daughter Zaynab\u2019s baby. They have been reunited with their maternal grandmother, Karen Nettleton.</p> <p><strong>Labor is demanding Peter Dutton release the details of a review into contracts worth almost $500m to manage the Manus Island offshore processing centre,</strong> before the Morrison government approves the next one, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/24/unthinkable-labor-says-peter-dutton-must-release-secret-audit-of-manus-island-contracts\">expected to occur within days</a>. The home affairs minister has been forced to defend his department\u2019s awarding Paladin, a previously little-known firm, a series of contracts to manage the Papua New Guinea offshore processing centre, without a tender process. The shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, is demanding Dutton first release the findings of an Ernst &amp; Young audit into the contracts, which was ordered in March, and expected to take just seven weeks. </p> <p><strong>Financial markets around the world are braced for a renewed period of turbulence this week as the US readies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/23/global-markets-braced-for-turmoil-as-us-prepares-iran-sanctions\">fresh sanctions against Iran</a>,</strong> and amid rising hopes for a breakthrough in the US-China trade war.

Writing to the mayor, the former first lady asked: \u2018Is it not cruel to let our city die by degrees, stripped of all her proud monuments, until there will be nothing left of all her history and beauty to inspire our children?\u2019 Nearly 50 years later, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/23/harlem-historic-churches-new-york-city-personal-essay\">the same threat hangs over Harlem</a>.

In an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/24/its-like-you-go-to-abuse-school-how-domestic-violence-always-follows-the-same-script\">extract from her book, See What You Made Me Do,</a> Hill traces the psychology of abusers and how they use the same techniques. One of the victims she speaks to, Deb, who now counsels domestic abuse victims and perpetrators, says one thing stands out about abusers: it\u2019s as if they\u2019ve studied some kind of domestic abuse handbook. \u201cThey all have the same tactics. So, for example, they may not come out and say, \u2018I don\u2019t want you seeing your friends, or having hobbies, or being around your parents,\u2019 but they\u2019ll just make it hard \u2026 And eventually women go it\u2019s just all too hard, because they don\u2019t want the fight.\u201d</p> <h2>Sport</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ee30bacf39ca571d02413db0f7f7920accdee80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ee30bacf39ca571d02413db0f7f7920accdee80/0_0_4253_2824/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Josh Addo-Carr of the Blues dives over to score a try during Game 2 of the 2019 State of Origin series.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Josh Addo-Carr of the Blues dives over to score a try during Game 2 of the 2019 State of Origin series.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darren England/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>NSW smashed the Queensland Maroons 38-6, setting up a Game 3 decider </strong>\u2013 and keeping the State of Origin series alive in a rain-soaked Game 2 at Optus Stadium in Perth. \u201cEach of coach Brad Fittler\u2019s contentious recruitment choices paid off for the Blues,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/23/blues-smash-maroons-in-perth-to-level-state-of-origin-series\">writes Matt Cleary</a>, \u201cwith so-called \u2018out-of-position\u2019 centres Jack Wighton and Tom Trbojevic having particularly strong games.</p> <p><strong>Ashleigh Barty will become the first Australian woman in 43 years <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/23/ashleigh-barty-world-no1-tennis\">to reach the top of the singles rankings</a></strong> after she won the Birmingham Classic grass court title on Sunday.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 24 June. Top stories The children of Islamic State terrorist Khaled Sharrouf have been removed from Syria and are set to return to Australia. Eight Australian children caught up in the Syrian war after their parents joined Islamic State have been spirited out of the country. The group includes five family members of Sharrouf, an Australian terrorist who made international headlines in a photograph standing next to his young son holding a severed human head. The remaining three are the children of the foreign fighter Yasin Rizvic and his wife, Fauzia Khamal Bacha, who joined Isis in 2014. It is the first instance of Australian children of foreign fighters being rescued from the northern Syrian camps. The eight children crossed into Iraqi Kurdistan at 3:30pm local time on Sunday into the care of Australian officials, and the Guardian has been asked not to disclose further geographical information for security reasons. All eight children are headed for Australia, but the Sharrouf children\u2019s return will be delayed because of the impending birth of Sharrouf\u2019s 17-year-old daughter Zaynab\u2019s baby. They have been reunited with their maternal grandmother, Karen Nettleton. Labor is demanding Peter Dutton release the details of a review into contracts worth almost $500m to manage the Manus Island offshore processing centre, before the Morrison government approves the next one, expected to occur within days. The home affairs minister has been forced to defend his department\u2019s awarding Paladin, a previously little-known firm, a series of contracts to manage the Papua New Guinea offshore processing centre, without a tender process. The shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, is demanding Dutton first release the findings of an Ernst &amp; Young audit into the contracts, which was ordered in March, and expected to take just seven weeks. Financial markets around the world are braced for a renewed period of turbulence this week as the US readies fresh sanctions against Iran, and amid rising hopes for a breakthrough in the US-China trade war. Iran has announced it may take further steps to pull away from its nuclear deal. John Bolton, Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser, said a fresh round of sanctions against Tehran would serve as a warning not to \u201cmistake US prudence and discretion for weakness\u201d. Donald Trump has meanwhile also dismissed a United Nations request for the FBI to investigate the murder of the dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, suggesting it would jeopardise American weapons sales to Saudi Arabia. Human Rights Watch has urged Australia to use its position on the United Nations human rights council to do more to stand up against abusive nations. In a letter to the foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, the Australia director at HRW, Elaine Pearson, noted that Australia has often preferred a \u201cquiet diplomacy\u201d style of advocating for human rights improvements with other countries, but said it needed to increase its public pressure to ensure that private discussions are not used to shield countries such as China, the Philippines, Bahrain and Egypt from international scrutiny. World Turkey\u2019s ruling party in Istanbul\u2019s controversial mayoral election rerun has conceded defeat, handing the nation\u2019s beleaguered opposition a victory that will have dramatic consequences for president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s grip on the country. More of Boris Johnson\u2019s neighbours have confirmed a row with his partner Carrie Symonds, which prompted a late-night police callout, with one saying the \u201ctear-up\u201d led him to believe that someone was being murdered. The chief of staff of Ethiopia\u2019s army has been shot dead at home by his bodyguard, and a regional governor has been killed in an attempted coup, the Ethiopian prime minister\u2019s office has said. An estimated 250,000 people have demanded the resignation of the Czech Republic\u2019s prime minister, in the country\u2019s biggest display of dissent since the 1989 velvet revolution that ended communism in the former Czechoslovakia. Paris is preparing pools, parks and \u201ccool rooms\u201d as French authorities fear for residents\u2019 health during the anticipated European heatwave. The French capital still carries the trauma of the 2003 heatwave, which caused many thousands of deaths in France and so many deaths in the Paris area that morgues ran out of space. Opinion and analysis On every Harlem corner, big money and bulldozers are threatening black history, writes historian Michael Henry Adams. \u201cIn New York in 1975, Jacqueline Kennedy was worried about a plan to destroy Grand Central Terminal. Writing to the mayor, the former first lady asked: \u2018Is it not cruel to let our city die by degrees, stripped of all her proud monuments, until there will be nothing left of all her history and beauty to inspire our children?\u2019 Nearly 50 years later, the same threat hangs over Harlem. It is nothing less than existential. In the home of so much African American history, churches and other landmarks are disappearing with a rapidity that invites thoughts of the indifference that places our whole planet at risk.\u201d How is it that men from vastly different cultures know to use the same basic techniques of oppression? asks Jess Hill. In an extract from her book, See What You Made Me Do, Hill traces the psychology of abusers and how they use the same techniques. One of the victims she speaks to, Deb, who now counsels domestic abuse victims and perpetrators, says one thing stands out about abusers: it\u2019s as if they\u2019ve studied some kind of domestic abuse handbook. \u201cThey all have the same tactics.

Ashleigh Barty will become the first Australian woman in 43 years to reach the top of the singles rankings after she won the Birmingham Classic grass court title on Sunday. The 23-year-old beat German Julia G\u00f6rges 6-3, 7-5 in the final, meaning when the new WTA rankings are released on Monday she will knock Japan\u2019s Naomi Osaka off the summit. A week before the Netball World Cup break, Maria Folau has been dragged into the controversy surrounding her husband, Israel Folau, after reposting a message supporting his legal campaign. Thinking time: the drug route you\u2019ve never heard of It\u2019s a multibillion dollar operation involving cocaine and methamphetamines being packed into the hulls of sailing boats in the US and Latin America and transported to Australia via South Pacific islands. In the past five years there has been an explosion in the number of boats, sometimes carrying more than a tonne of cocaine, making the journey across the Pacific Ocean to feed Australia\u2019s growing and very lucrative drug habit.

Media roundup A cancer patient at a Sydney hospital has had the wrong body part removed during surgery, the Sydney Morning Herald reveals. Scott Morrison will use his first major domestic speech since the election to \u201cchallenge business to make the case for industrial relations and red tape reform,\u201d the Australian Financial Review reports.

This week, Commander Lawrence appears to have transformed from self-sacrificing lovely-chops into full-blown nightmare. He is short and snappy with Beth and Sienna, his overly solicitous Marthas. They buzz around him as the house prepares for the visit of the local commanders. He delights in humiliating Sienna as she cleans up a spilled drink and that moment where he asks June if she knows the penalty for opening a front door, suggests he is just in it for the cruelty and head games now.

Or I take a longer break post-Wimbledon of maybe, let\u2019s say, a month or six weeks to get myself ready for singles and then try and play close to the US Open time. \u201cI guess those would be the two options. I don\u2019t anticipate it would be much longer than that. My schedule could potentially be a bit different. I might not play three weeks in a row or two weeks back to back, for example. \u201cBut I\u2019m just quite happy doing what I\u2019m doing, taking each week as it comes. If things keep going well, I\u2019ll try and play singles. If I start training and I think actually I\u2019m not going to compete at a level I\u2019m happy with, yeah. \u201cI know in Australia I didn\u2019t anticipate playing doubles, but I also didn\u2019t anticipate feeling like this and enjoying playing tennis like this, either. We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d Murray, who had his hip resurfaced in January and now plays with a metal insert, was alert, strong and confident. Transferring to singles, though, will be complicated. He lost in five sets against Roberto Bautista Agut in the first round of the Australian Open, and broke down in tears afterwards, resigned to quitting the game. That he has managed to come back to this sort of level in five months is remarkable. The former British No 1 Greg Rusedski said of the theatre that unfolded in fading light on Centre Court: \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have scripted it any better. He\u2019s our greatest sportsman of this generation, when fit.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Alyssa Naeher isn\u2019t exactly one to talk about herself. That\u2019s why a reporter thought Carli Lloyd could fill in the gaps: what should the world know about USA\u2019s starting goalkeeper? \u201cI think Alyssa Naeher doesn\u2019t want anybody to know about Alyssa Naeher,\u201d Lloyd said, laughing. Naeher is USA\u2019s first World Cup starter in goal not named Hope Solo or Briana Scurry in two decades and, although casual fans may be unfamiliar with the spotlight-shy goalkeeper now, she will eventually step out of the shadows of Solo and Scurry. Either because she will finally concede a goal in this tournament, or because she will save USA\u2019s hide. Neither has happened yet, but with the US facing Spain in the last 16 on Monday, both those scenarios are coming into view. Although Sweden were supposed to be the first \u201creal\u201d test of the US back line, the Swedes were already through to the knockout round and content to rest top players when the two teams met last Thursday. Spain, meanwhile, will be playing for their World Cup lives. If the stats are to be believed, Spain underperformed during the group stage. Their expected non-penalty goals was around 5.5, eighth best in the tournament, but they instead scored just once from open play, according to InStat. If Spain sharpen their finishing, they could be a handful for the Americans \u2013 and for Naeher. Spain\u2019s only loss in this World Cup came by a single goal to superpower Germany, and they are one of the emerging teams in women\u2019s football. Spain won and came second in the U-17 and U-20 World Cups respectively, and there is hope that the senior side can make a leap forward of their own. What separates Spain from some other countries is that their tiki-taka, free-flowing style permeates the entire program \u2013 from the men\u2019s side to the women\u2019s side, at the senior level and on down to the youth teams. The Americans faced Spain in a friendly in January, and a narrow 1-0 win for the US shows the reigning champions cannot expect a walkover. \u201cI wasn\u2019t there in January when we played them but I watched on TV and I thought they were really, really good technically and really understood their relationships,\u201d said defender Ali Krieger. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough to break [them] down.\u201d Indeed, it is the US who may be the easiest of the two to break down. When they have faced top teams this year, they have conceded multiple goals more often than not. They are yet to concede in this World Cup, but they also haven\u2019t been challenged much either, facing few shots on target \u2013 and those that Naeher did handle were straight at her.

      "bodyText": "Spitting, elbows in the face and temper tantrums. England had arrived in quaint yet sophisticated Valenciennes on Friday likely not expecting that by Sunday evening they would feel like they were in a nursery. Yet that is what the Stade du Hainaut became as the Cameroon national team fell to pieces and threw their toys out of the pram in style. And all that after impressing so many in the group stage. After their 1-0 defeat by Canada the Cameroon manager, Alain Djeumfa, had to temper expectations, shielding the almighty performance of his players from a frustrated national press by pointing out the gap of 31 places between the two sides in the Fifa rankings. That\u2019s how good they had been. Against the Netherlands, a leveller from their outstanding captain, Gabrielle Ongu\u00e9n\u00e9, was enough to earn them further plaudits despite a 3-1 loss come the 90th minute. Their passage to the last 16 as a best third-place finisher was well earned after beating New Zealand, and it made the utter collapse witnessed against England all the more surreal. Just four minutes in and they should have been reduced to 10 players, Yvonne Leuko whacking an elbow into the face of Nikita Parris with force as Lyon\u2019s new winger looked to round her marker. Leuko earned a yellow, their seventh up to that point in the tournament, but it should have been red. VAR did not call back the incident, suggesting violent conduct is less important than marginal movement of a goalkeeper. On the quarter-hour mark a rookie error by the above mentioned Augustine Ejangue with a back pass to the goalkeeper Annette Ngo Ndom while under pressure from Toni Duggan. As the England winger gestured to the referee, Leuko took the no-look pass in a new direction, going for the no-look spit, gobbing on to Duggan\u2019s outstretched arm. The referee, though, was unmoved by the sight of white spittle dripping down the limb. In a spectacle much more akin to the playground, the entire Cameroon XI lined up along the goalline for Steph Houghton\u2019s resultant indirect free-kick and raced towards her en masse as she connected. Just as it so often fails on playground Tarmac, so the tactic failed on the turf of this intimate stadium \u2013 funnily enough, 11 bodies still cannot fill the eight yards between the posts. As the end of the half approached Ellen White\u2019s goal sent the players in green and red into complete meltdown. Following a delay to consult VAR, the clearly onside goal was allowed but the Cameroon side disagreed. Refusing to restart the match the entire team descended on the referee in the centre circle remonstrating about the decision, outfield players gesturing for the goalkeeper to join the fray and she duly obliged. A desperate Djeumfa could only wave for his team to reform from his technical area, the man called \u201cMean Dog\u201d (by his players) reduced to impotent dog. With the whistle gone for half-time the players remained on the pitch in a huddle, trying to level lost heads. They emerged at the restart in the same fashion, cowered in the centre circle, willing themselves to find some flow and much-needed patience. It looked to have worked, the calm seemed to have been sapped out of the Lionesses at the break and into the Indomitable Lionesses. Ajara Nchout hit the back of the net after a poor clearance from Karen Bardsley put Lucy Bronze in trouble, but VAR ruled it out for offside. It was marginal. Very marginal. But, to the letter of the law, correct. However in the playground it felt unjust, another attempt to deny the underdogs entry to the game, and the tears of Nchout flowed in despair as the players moved towards the touchline and looked closer to walking off than ever. Thankfully they didn\u2019t. In the second half VAR was once again under scrutiny, and this time the decision was way off, with the foul on Fran Kirby in the box the replay was clear, but with the masses baying and the referee\u2019s control of the game on the brink this may have been a diplomatic call with England cruising at 3-0. On 90 minutes the Cameroon anger was let loose, Alexandra Takounda shoving Houghton off the pitch while brutally raking an ankle. A parting gift from a broken team who had undone the positive work of the group stage in emphatic, childish fashion. Again the referee and VAR bottled the decision, waving a yellow card instead of a red. At the final whistle she was almost waving a white flag in relief.",

      "bodyText": "It is the drug route you\u2019ve never heard of: a multibillion-dollar operation involving cocaine and methamphetamines being packed into the hulls of sailing boats in the US and Latin America and transported to Australia via South Pacific islands more often thought of as holiday destinations than narcotics hubs. In the past five years there has been an explosion in the number of boats, sometimes carrying more than a tonne of cocaine, making the journey across the Pacific Ocean to feed Australia\u2019s growing and very lucrative drug habit. Caught in the middle are countries such as Fiji, which the Guardian visited as part of a series investigating the Pacific drug highway. Other countries affected include Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea, Tonga and New Caledonia, whose waters and beaches are being used as storage grounds for billions of dollars worth of illicit drugs. Hundreds of kilograms of cocaine have washed up on remote Pacific beaches, ships laden with drugs have run aground on far-flung coral reefs, and locals have discovered huge caches of drugs stored in underwater nets attached to GPS beacons. \u201cDraw a direct line between Bogot\u00e1 and Canberra and it goes straight through the islands,\u201d says Dr Andreas Schloenhardt, professor of criminal law at the University of Queensland. The Pacific has been a transit point in the drug route for decades, but law enforcement and security analysts told the Guardian the use of the route appears to have increased dramatically in the past five years. Since 2014, Australian federal police have been involved in the seizure of about 7.5 tonnes of cocaine shipped in small vessels such as yachts through the region and intended for Australia. In 2004, police seized 120kg of cocaine on a beach in Vanuatu, a bust the AFP heralded as \u201cthe biggest such haul in the Pacific nation\u2019s history\u201d. Nine years later, police made a bust involving more than six times this amount. Since 2016, there have been six major seizures of drugs in French Polynesia. In 2017, a yacht was intercepted near New Caledonia with 1.464 tonnes of cocaine hidden in its hull and another boat was stopped just off Australia\u2019s east coast with more than 1.4 tonnes of cocaine on board. Each of these shipments were worth more than $US200m. \u201cSeizures are becoming larger, larger quantities are being trafficked,\u201d Schloenhardt says. \u2018Terrible, terrible violence\u2019 The region is caught in a perfect storm. Cocaine production is at its highest rate. At the same time, the appetite for cocaine consumption in Australia, which has one of the highest rates of per capita cocaine use of any in the world, has exploded. Australians and New Zealanders also pay more for the drug (about AU$300 or \u00a3180 a gram) than those anywhere else in the world, making it a lucrative market. Drugs come into Australia through a range of means including cargo ships, cruise ships and air freight. A Fijian flight attendant was arrested in December 2018 for trying to export cocaine and in March the AFP arrested two men, one who was an employee at Sydney airport, for being part of a meth-smuggling operation. But given the tight security measures involved in air travel, the tightening of customs controls at airports in many Pacific nations and the fact that there are few direct flights between Latin America and Australia and New Zealand, sailing the drugs through the Pacific has become an increasingly profitable and popular way for dealers to get drugs to the destination. \u201cThe unfortunate thing is the Pacific is at the heart of this,\u201d says Tevita Tupou, operations manager for the Oceania Customs Organisation. Some of the larger Pacific nations are starting to see serious cocaine and methamphetamine addiction, as well as associated gang violence, crime and police corruption. Superintendent Brett Kidner, who served as senior liaison officer for the AFP in the Pacific region from 2016 to the beginning of 2019, said during his time based in Suva he noticed a \u201cshift in attitudes\u201d toward illicit drugs among Pacific nations. \u201cWhereas initially they considered it predominantly a problem for Australia and New Zealand, and they were merely transit points, at the end there they were starting to see a significant increase in their domestic use \u2026 I definitely saw an increase in use in Fiji, Tonga, Samoa.\u201d The transnational shipment of drugs through the Pacific is not the only cause of Fiji\u2019s burgeoning domestic drug problem, says the country\u2019s police commissioner, Sitiveni Qiliho, who spoke to the Guardian on a police boat during a patrol along the west coast of Fiji\u2019s main island. A booming tourism industry and increasing wealth in the country also play a part. \u201cWhen [traffickers] get in drugs, normally they drop off a few kilos for payment and that is what goes into the market, so that increases the usage,\u201d Qiliho says. Ian Collingwood [see footnote], who has lived in Fiji for most of his life and has fallen into drug addiction, told the Guardian that the nation\u2019s drug problem could no longer be described as emerging but as \u201cwell-emerged and sizeable\u201d. Speaking on a sunny afternoon at a popular cafe in Nadi, he says: \u201cA hundred metres from where we are you can purchase methamphetamine and cocaine, just like that, no problem. Not a problem at all.\u201d Collingwood says that with the drugs has come \u201cterrible, terrible violence\u201d. \u201cLike in any country, at the top of the food chain, drug dealers here are dangerous men, very very bad, phenomenally bad,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ll have you kidnapped and dropped off in the bush somewhere, they\u2019ll smash your kneecaps or worse, you\u2019ll get acid poured on your face, you\u2019ll get killed.

Since becoming police commissioner in November 2015, Qiliho has found himself involved in a different sort of battle, as Fiji has become a stop-off for drug traffickers moving their illicit cargo through the Pacific.</p> <p>\u201cThe fight against drugs is something that keeps me going,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Fiji, one of the most populous and developed nations in the Pacific, is made up of more than 330 islands spanning 194,000 sq km (75,000 sq mi). Qiliho estimates his officers spend at least a quarter of their time trying to stamp out drug trafficking and production as part of Operation Vavuraka, which means uprooting.</p> <p>One aspect of the operation is the literal uprooting of marijuana plants. Because the country is so fertile, police have had cases of marijuana plants sprouting inside and around police stations, after marijuana plants brought in to be used as evidence have dropped seeds.</p> <p>But Fiji has also started having to deal not just with \u201cgreen drugs\u201d, as Qiliho calls them, but also \u201cwhite drugs\u201d \u2013 cocaine and methamphetamine. Some arrive with tourists, others come through gangs exploiting the country\u2019s location at the heart of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/24/the-new-drug-highway-pacific-islands-at-centre-of-cocaine-trafficking-boom\">drug trafficking route</a> that starts in the US and Latin America and ends in Australia and New Zealand.</p> <h2>Fishermen \u2018are not after fish any more\u2019</h2> <p>Onboard the Veiqaravi patrol boat as it plies the waters off the west coast of Fiji\u2019s main island, Qiliho is explaining how 120 bricks of cocaine, each worth thousands of dollars, washed up on remote Fijian islands in 2018.</p> <p>Traffickers had filled a large net \u2013 \u201cabout the size of this cabin\u201d, says Qiliho, \u201cabout four metres squared\u201d \u2013 with hundreds of 1kg packages of cocaine wrapped in plastic. The net was submerged in the ocean attached to a transponder.</p> <p>\u201cIn this particular case \u2026 [the anchored rope] snapped because of the weather conditions and the net floated up and tore on the reef,\u201d Qiliho explains.</p> <p>Qiliho scrambled to get officers out to the islands to secure the drugs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f6043bbb397572ad70aac189c658001dc53190d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f6043bbb397572ad70aac189c658001dc53190d/0_0_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A crew member of the police boat Veiqaravi in Fiji\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A crew member of the police boat Veiqaravi in Fiji.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Rickman/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The nightmare scenario for police in these cases, says Superintendent Brett Kidner, who served as senior liaison officer for the Australian federal police in the Pacific region based in Suva at the time, is that people will consume the drug, not knowing what it is. In one case in the Federated States of Micronesia, cocaine discovered in a lagoon was used as washing powder, until locals realised it wasn\u2019t lathering. In Tahiti in 2017 a boat full of cocaine exploded on a remote reef. Weeks later police discovered an island almost totally addicted to cocaine.</p> <p>\u201cOur biggest concern was that people may think these packages contain sugar, powdered toothpaste or they may think it was baking powder or something along those lines and as a result subject their families to a harm that they shouldn\u2019t have been subjected to,\u201d Kidner says.</p> <p>For Qiliho, the fear has shifted from people unknowingly ingesting the drugs to them keeping the drugs to sell.</p> <p>\u201cWe picked up information that some fishermen going out diving were not after fish any more,\u201d says Qiliho. \u201cThey were after these packages because of the money that is being offered, a few thousand dollars. It was quick, easy money.\u201d</p> <p>Another such net was discovered in Fiji\u2019s waters in March by a man out for a boat trip with his father.

      "bodyText": "Sitiveni Qiliho, Fiji\u2019s police commissioner, says he doesn\u2019t watch films any more because, since taking on Fiji police\u2019s top job two years ago, his life has enough drama. Over the past few months he has found himself scuba diving in search of multimillion-dollar stashes of cocaine stored in huge underwater nets, arresting drug traffickers on the high seas and informing remote islands communities that the mysterious packages washing up on their beaches are full of cocaine and shouldn\u2019t be baked into cakes or put in tea. \u201cIt\u2019s what movie scripts are made of ... all the Hollywood blockbuster movies about drugs are centred around this script,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t watch movies, I deal with it in real life.\u201d Qiliho spent more than 25 years in Fiji\u2019s army, serving abroad in various UN missions, before leaving in 2015 as a brigadier. Since becoming police commissioner in November 2015, Qiliho has found himself involved in a different sort of battle, as Fiji has become a stop-off for drug traffickers moving their illicit cargo through the Pacific. \u201cThe fight against drugs is something that keeps me going,\u201d he says. Fiji, one of the most populous and developed nations in the Pacific, is made up of more than 330 islands spanning 194,000 sq km (75,000 sq mi). Qiliho estimates his officers spend at least a quarter of their time trying to stamp out drug trafficking and production as part of Operation Vavuraka, which means uprooting. One aspect of the operation is the literal uprooting of marijuana plants. Because the country is so fertile, police have had cases of marijuana plants sprouting inside and around police stations, after marijuana plants brought in to be used as evidence have dropped seeds. But Fiji has also started having to deal not just with \u201cgreen drugs\u201d, as Qiliho calls them, but also \u201cwhite drugs\u201d \u2013 cocaine and methamphetamine. Some arrive with tourists, others come through gangs exploiting the country\u2019s location at the heart of a drug trafficking route that starts in the US and Latin America and ends in Australia and New Zealand. Fishermen \u2018are not after fish any more\u2019 Onboard the Veiqaravi patrol boat as it plies the waters off the west coast of Fiji\u2019s main island, Qiliho is explaining how 120 bricks of cocaine, each worth thousands of dollars, washed up on remote Fijian islands in 2018. Traffickers had filled a large net \u2013 \u201cabout the size of this cabin\u201d, says Qiliho, \u201cabout four metres squared\u201d \u2013 with hundreds of 1kg packages of cocaine wrapped in plastic. The net was submerged in the ocean attached to a transponder. \u201cIn this particular case \u2026 [the anchored rope] snapped because of the weather conditions and the net floated up and tore on the reef,\u201d Qiliho explains. Qiliho scrambled to get officers out to the islands to secure the drugs. The nightmare scenario for police in these cases, says Superintendent Brett Kidner, who served as senior liaison officer for the Australian federal police in the Pacific region based in Suva at the time, is that people will consume the drug, not knowing what it is. In one case in the Federated States of Micronesia, cocaine discovered in a lagoon was used as washing powder, until locals realised it wasn\u2019t lathering. In Tahiti in 2017 a boat full of cocaine exploded on a remote reef. Weeks later police discovered an island almost totally addicted to cocaine. \u201cOur biggest concern was that people may think these packages contain sugar, powdered toothpaste or they may think it was baking powder or something along those lines and as a result subject their families to a harm that they shouldn\u2019t have been subjected to,\u201d Kidner says. For Qiliho, the fear has shifted from people unknowingly ingesting the drugs to them keeping the drugs to sell. \u201cWe picked up information that some fishermen going out diving were not after fish any more,\u201d says Qiliho. \u201cThey were after these packages because of the money that is being offered, a few thousand dollars. It was quick, easy money.\u201d Another such net was discovered in Fiji\u2019s waters in March by a man out for a boat trip with his father. The man removed the transponder to hand in to police, and tried to describe the location of the net to police but, despite Qiliho and his men scuba diving for several days, they never found the drugs. Qiliho says the battle is a \u201cDavid and Goliath\u201d one. For a start, there is a question of resources. The Veiqaravi, a gift from the AFP, is an incredibly useful resource, but it is also Fiji police\u2019s only large patrol boat. The lack of resources means locals have alerted police to suspicious boats in their waters but, by the time officers arrive, the vessels have vanished. \u201cIt\u2019s no use the information coming 48 hours late and things have gone,\u201d he says, citing one bust where Fijian and New Zealand police recovered about 30 blocks of cocaine from a storage facility they estimate could have held 800. \u201cSo where\u2019s the rest?\u201d he asks. \u201cProbably on its way to Australia and New Zealand.\u201d Qiliho says Pacific authorities consistently find themselves two steps behind the traffickers. \u201c[They\u2019re] very creative,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat will be the next mode of transportation? Moved by air before, now by sea, what\u2019s coming next? \u201cIt\u2019s something we can\u2019t afford to take our foot off the pedal. We\u2019ve got to maintain that momentum and keep fighting, only then will we succeed. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the effects of drug usage in other countries, we don\u2019t want that.\u201d Qiliho says he urges his officers to think about the sort of society they want for their children and grandchildren. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to retire and be an old man in the village and have one of my mates come up to me when we\u2019re sitting around having kava and say, \u2018Man, you were the commissioner of police and you did nothing about it, and see where Fiji is now.\u2019\u201d",

Under the deal, Iran unplugged two-thirds of its centrifuges, shipped out 98% of its enriched uranium and filled its plutonium production reactor with concrete. Tehran also accepted extensive monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has verified 10 times since the agreement, and as recently as February, that Tehran has complied with its terms.

The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.</p>\n    <p>On 8 May 2018, US president Donald Trump pulled his country out of the deal. Iran announced its partial withdrawal from the nuclear deal a year later.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/saeedkamalidehghan\">Saeed Kamali Dehghan</a>,</b>&nbsp;<i>Iran correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>On further questioning he added the demand that Tehran should not have a ballistic missile programme, and suggested he wanted a tougher inspection regime.</p> \n<p>Iran has said it does not want to acquire nuclear weapons and has agreed not to do so under the non-proliferation treaty.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has pledged that Iran\u2019s \u201cabsolutely broken\u201d economy will face \u201cmajor\u201d new sanctions on Monday, as Iran countered it would take further steps to increase its nuclear programme unless Europe does more to shield it from US pressure over the coming fortnight. The US president claimed that Iran wanted to negotiate because of the relentless economic pressure from sanctions. Tehran has so far rejected any talks while sanctions remain, and there was no sign of relief on Sunday. Despite calling off airstrikes that had been planned in reprisal to the downing of a US drone on Thursday, tensions in the Gulf remain high. On Sunday, one person was reported dead and seven wounded in a suspected drone attack on a Abha airport in southern Saudi Arabia. The Houthi movement in Yemen, which is backed by Iran, claimed responsibility for the second drone attack on the Abha airport in 10 days, and also claimed to have struck the airport in Jizan, on the south-west Saudi coast. John Bolton, Trump\u2019s national security adviser, warned Iran not to mistake US prudence for weakness. It was reported that the US carried out a cyber-attack on an organisation linked to Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards suspected of being involved in tracking and attacking tanker traffic and naval deployments in the Gulf. A US official told CNN the US cyber command targeted software that was used to track tankers targeted in attacks in the Gulf of Oman on 13 June. Iranian cyber spies are also said to have extensively used social media, approaching sailors online while pretending to be young women, to mine intelligence on their ships\u2019 movements. Bolton was judged to have lost an inter-agency dispute last week when Trump pulled back from missile strikes on three Iranian military sites. Trump said the US air force was \u201ccocked and loaded\u201d when he decided the estimated civilian death toll of a military action would be a disproportionate response to Iran\u2019s downing of the unmanned drone. But Bolton, speaking in Jerusalem before a three-way conference between the US, Russia and Israel on the future role of Iran in Syria, insisted the US had not lost its nerve. He said no one had granted Iran \u201ca hunting licence in the Middle East\u201d. He echoed Trump\u2019s warnings that the US military was \u201crebuilt, new and ready to go\u201d, and said \u201cbiting\u201d new sanctions would be imposed on Monday. \u201cIran\u2019s continued pursuit of nuclear weapons, its threats to exceed the limits set in the failed Iran nuclear deal in the coming days \u2026 are not signs of a nation seeking peace,\u201d Bolton said. However, back in Washington Trump issued one of his frequent reminders that Bolton does not have the final say in US national security matters, but is just one voice among several competing views. \u201cJohn Bolton is absolutely a hawk. If it was up to him he\u2019d take on the whole world at one time, OK? But that doesn\u2019t matter because I want both sides,\u201d Trump told NBC News\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday. He pointed to the disastrous US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 \u2013 a war Bolton aggressively advocated \u2013 as a reason for caution in the Middle East. However, the president warned that any more hostile acts by Iran could draw a more forceful military response than the one planned and aborted on Thursday. \u201cSo what happened is I said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to do it. I\u2019ll save it. If they do something else, it\u2019ll be double\u2019,\u201d Trump told NBC, adding that he would continue to ramp up sanctions. \u201cWe are putting major additional sanctions on Iran on Monday,\u201d Trump tweeted. In his NBC interview he added: \u201cI think that they want to negotiate. I don\u2019t think they like the position they\u2019re in. Their economy is, is absolutely broken.\u201d As he has done on almost every occasion he has discussed Iran, Trump offered direct talks with \u201cno preconditions\u201d focused on Iran\u2019s nuclear programme. He said he told Shinz\u014d Abe, before the Japanese prime minister visited Tehran on 12 June: \u201cSend the following message: you can\u2019t have nuclear weapons. And other than that, we can sit down and make a deal. But you cannot have nuclear weapons.\u201d On further questioning he added the demand that Tehran should not have a ballistic missile programme, and suggested he wanted a tougher inspection regime. Iran has said it does not want to acquire nuclear weapons and has agreed not to do so under the non-proliferation treaty. Until now, it has stuck to the limits on its nuclear programme agreed in a 2015 multilateral deal, which Trump withdrew the US from last May and has since tried to destroy. Faced with a US-imposed oil embargo and a web of other sanctions, Iran has warned in recent months that it will cease to abide by some elements of the 2015 agreement. It is allowing stocks of low-enriched uranium to build up, and President Hassan Rouhani has warned that if Europe does not do more to shield Iran from US sanctions by a 8 July deadline, it will take the much more significant step of increasing its uranium enrichment levels, bringing it closer to weapons grade. On Sunday, the head of Tehran\u2019s strategic council on foreign relations suggested Iran could further raise the stakes. \u201cIf Europeans don\u2019t take measures within the 60-day deadline [announced by Iran in May], we will take new steps,\u201d the semi-official news agency ISNA quoted Kamal Kharazi as saying. Speaking after meeting the British Middle East minister, Andrew Murrison, in Tehran, Kharazi said Europeans should provide capital for the special trading vehicle designed to enable European trade with Iran and circumvent US sanctions. Accusing Europe of failing to deliver on its promises, he said: \u201cOne should see whether Europe is making empty promises or taking practical steps in the two weeks that remain until the deadline.\u201d European solidarity in support of the 2015 nuclear deal and resistance to the drift towards conflict may be affected by the current Conservative Party contest to replace Theresa May as the UK\u2019s prime minister. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary and one of the two contenders for the top job, said the UK could support the US in a conflict with Iran, depending on the circumstances. \u201cWe will stand by the United States as our strongest ally but of course we have to consider any requests for military support on a case-by-case basis,\u201d Hunt said while campaigning in Scotland, according to the Daily Mail. \u201cWe want to de-escalate the situation but we are of course extremely worried.\u201d The UK has its own points of friction with Iran. On his visit to Tehran, Murrison raised the plight of the Iranian dual national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is on hunger strike in a Tehran jail. She is serving a five-year sentence for espionage, a charge she denies. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, is on a sympathy hunger strike outside the Iranian embassy in London. A stream of well-wishers have been to visit him, including Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson.",

The rangy Salisbury\u2019s looking the sharpest player out there. And it\u2019s fitting that he\u2019s the one to seal the break with a lovely forehand down the line. \u201cCome on!\u201d he cries.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d0faf1a8f081e872734d40c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-23T16:59:36.191Z\">5.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>First set: Murray/Lopez 3-3 Ram/Salisbury* (*denotes server): </strong>Lopez is stretching a fair bit during the changeover.

Andy Murray, that\u2019s who. Only the greatest British player of all time. How\u2019s your luck, Joe?</p> <p><strong>What a story, though.</strong> Murray being Murray, of course, perhaps we should have expected this from him as he embarks on what almost counts as a second career after all the pain he\u2019s gone through. Six months ago, though, we were all writing the obituaries. Everyone remembers that emotional press conference before the Australian Open, when it seemed he was on the verge of retirement, and assumed he\u2019d played his final ever match when he lost to Roberto Bautista Agut in the first round in Melbourne. Only, it turned out Murray wasn\u2019t ready to say goodbye. He went under the knife again, switched the faulty hip for a metal one and set about preparing for a dramatic return. And here we are. With a man who was using his racquet as a crutch not so long ago in the doubles final in his first tournament back since hip surgery. It really is ridiculous.</p> <p><strong>But that\u2019s Murray for you, always ready to surprise, never willing to give in without a fight. </strong>Having said that, mind you, what\u2019s stood out about this comeback is how happy he\u2019s looked on court so far. The limp and grimace have both gone and Murray just looks like he\u2019s delighted to be playing tennis again. He isn\u2019t fighting; he\u2019s just enjoying himself and it\u2019s delightful to watch.</p> <p><strong>Not that the fiery competitive spirit has disappeared, of course. </strong>No chance of that happening. Instead Murray\u2019s making big plans. He\u2019s off to Eastbourne with Brazil\u2019s Marcelo Melo, then he\u2019s off to Wimbledon to play with the excellent Pierre Hugues-Herbert and he also wants a mixed doubles partner at SW19 (Serena? Venus? Judy?). </p> <p><strong>The ultimate aim is to get back into singles.</strong> But before all that he needs to win this match. It might not be straightforward, though, given that his partner, the 37-year-old Feliciano Lopez, appears to be involved in a charity tennisathon. Yesterday Lopez reached the singles final after seeing off Canada\u2019s Felix Auger-Aliassime in three sets. Then he had a short break. Then he helped Murray polish off their rain-delayed quarter-final against Dan Evans and Ken Skupski. Then he helped Murray win their semi-final against Henri Kontinen and John Peers. It was almost 9pm by the time he was done. He must be knackered.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s more, the Spaniard has to get his singles final against Gilles Simon done before this match begins</strong>. Absurd. Who knows what state he\u2019ll be in by the end of the day? One thing\u2019s for sure: he\u2019s bound to be stiff and that could play work against him. Salisbury, a 27-year-old Londoner who reached the Wimbledon semis last year, and the USA\u2019s Rajeev Ram knocked out doubles legends the Bryans brothers yesterday. They aren\u2019t to be taken lightly.</p> <p><strong>Play begins ...</strong> soon.</p> </div>   </div>",

But the story, of course, is Andy Murray. He\u2019s back! After everything, he\u2019s back! And who knows what happens next? Obviously he\u2019s winning Wimbledon next month. And then? Don\u2019t rule anything out. It\u2019s Andy Murray. Anyway that\u2019s all from me. Thanks for reading. Bye! Feliciano Lopez, who\u2019s played the last five matches on Centre Court, tells Murray it\u2019s great to see him back on the court. \u201cIt\u2019s been brilliant,\u201d Murray says. \u201cI\u2019ve really enjoyed it. I felt very relaxed at the beginning of the week and then I felt more nervous. My competitive instincts were kicking in. My hip felt great. No pain. I\u2019ll just try to keep playing. I said I would chat to my team about mixed doubles in the next few days and decide by the middle of next week.\u201d Andy Murray speaks! \u201cFeliciano was brilliant. An amazing win in the singles and even at the end of the mach there he came up with some amazing serves and brilliant returns.\u201d Andy Murray, metal hip still intact, and Feliciano Lopez, who won the singles title earlier, go up to collect the trophy. Lopez has done the singles-doubles double! Rajeev Ram and Joe Salisbury, a new pairing this year, get a big ovation as they collect their runners-up dishes. They contributed massively to an absorbing final. Would you put it past Andy Murray to request a last-minute singles wild card at Wimbledon? No, you wouldn\u2019t. Andy Murray, though. Feliciano Lopez, though. Match tie-break: Murray*/Lopez 10-5 Ram/Salisbury (*denotes server): Murray misses another first serve. The tension grows. But his second serve\u2019s strong and Salisbury sends a forehand return wide! Murray leaps, punches the air and hugs the incredible Feliciano Lopez! What a comeback from the former world No1!

Match tie-break: Murray/Lopez 9-4 Ram*/Salisbury (*denotes server): Lopez swipes a vicious forehand return down the line. Ram and Salisbury don\u2019t bother challenging. It\u2019s championship point!

Match tie-break: Murray/Lopez* 7-4 Ram/Salisbury (*denotes server): Lopez serve-volleys brilliantly. Then he jumps into a celebration with Murray. How is he still going?

Match tie-break: Murray/Lopez 5-4 Ram/Salisbury* (*denotes server): Lopez pummels a forehand return down the line.

Then he\u2019s caught out by a Ram return down by his feet. 0-30. Soon it\u2019s 15-40 to Ram and Salisbury. Salisbury has a chance to win the set, but he nets a forehand. On the next one, however, Ram draws a wayward volley from Lopez. We\u2019ll have a match tie-break! It will be first to 10. Second set: Murray/Lopez 7-6, 5-6 Ram*/Salisbury (*denotes server): Ram holds to 15. Murray will serve to force a tie-break. Second set: Murray/Lopez* 7-6, 5-5 Ram/Salisbury (*denotes server): At 30-0 Murray takes a tumble on the side of the court. Panic! Only for a moment, though. He\u2019s up quickly, though, and helps Lopez hold to 15 easily. Second set: Murray/Lopez 7-6, 4-5 Ram/Salisbury* (*denotes server): Two snappy volleys from Ram make it 30-0. Salisbury holds to love with an ace. Lopez will serve to keep the set alive. Second set: Murray*/Lopez 7-6, 4-4 Ram/Salisbury (*denotes server): Murray thinks he\u2019s in control at 40-15. But Ram makes it 40-30 and then Murray misses a volley. Not by much, but by enough, and it\u2019s a deciding point. Yet Murray manages a good enough serve to force Ram to knock a return wide. Second set: Murray/Lopez 7-6, 3-4 Ram*/Salisbury (*denotes server): Ram nets a forehand at the end of an entertaining point. 0-15. Then Salisbury smashes for 15-all. But Ram\u2019s feeling anxious. At 15-30 Murray pounces on a Ram serve, pounding a forehand down the line. Ram makes it 30-40 with a deft volley. Then Murray sends a backhand lob long. Now it\u2019s a deciding point - and Ram and Salisbury get out of jail when the latter summons a violent smash to end the argument. Second set: Murray/Lopez* 7-6, 3-3 Ram/Salisbury (*denotes server): Murray comes up with a sharp volley for 15-0. Then Ram clips the line with a beauty of a backhand return. Murray, always useless at HawkEye, challenges incorrectly. The game goes to 30-all. Lopez sends a serve down the middle with interest. Salisbury, channelling Murray, challenges incorrectly. It goes to 40-30 and Lopez holds. Second set: Murray/Lopez 7-6, 2-3 Ram/Salisbury* (*denotes server): It\u2019s Salisbury\u2019s turn to hold to 15. He\u2019s serving well. And he bounces up and down a lot. Second set: Murray*/Lopez 7-6, 2-2 Ram/Salisbury (*denotes server): Murray holds to 15. Second set: Murray/Lopez 7-6, 1-2 Ram*/Salisbury (*denotes server): Ram looks comfortable at 40-0. He\u2019s made to sweat a little when Murray and Lopez get it to 40-30, though. Then a low Murray return forces Ram to volley wide. Deuce means it\u2019s a deciding point. Yet Murray misses a forehand return. He\u2019s annoyed. Second set: Murray/Lopez* 7-6, 1-1 Ram/Salisbury (*denotes server): Lopez wallops an ace down the middle to hold to 30. Second set: Murray/Lopez 7-6, 0-1 Ram/Salisbury* (*denotes server): Ram and Salisbury will need to clear their heads quickly. They served for the opening set and also led 5-1 in the tie-break. Encouragingly, they begin with a hold to 15 for Salisbury. First set tie-break: Murray/Lopez 8-6 Ram*/Salisbury (*denotes server): Ram serves. He\u2019s drawn to the net. Lopez has a few attempts at passing him - and eventually Ram dabs a volley wide! First set tie-break: Murray*/Lopez 7-6 Ram/Salisbury (*denotes server): Salisbury blocks a return long. Murray and Lopez have a set point. First set tie-break: Murray*/Lopez 6-6 Ram/Salisbury (*denotes server): Ram nets a forehand off a tight second serve from Murray. First set tie-break: Murray/Lopez 5-6 Ram/Salisbury* (*denotes server): Lopez sends a backhand return just wide. Set point for Ram and Salisbury. First set tie-break: Murray/Lopez 5-5 Ram/Salisbury* (*denotes server): A fizzing Murray backhand return leaves Salisbury on his knees. That looked nasty for a moment, but it seems Salisbury\u2019s fine to continue. First set tie-break: Murray/Lopez* 4-5 Ram/Salisbury (*denotes server): Salisbury sends a forehand long by a whisker. First set tie-break: Murray/Lopez* 3-5 Ram/Salisbury (*denotes server): Ram lofts a return wide. First set tie-break: Murray/Lopez 2-5 Ram*/Salisbury (*denotes server): Murray gets one back. First set tie-break: Murray/Lopez 1-5 Ram*/Salisbury (*denotes server): Salisbury produces another excellent volley. First set tie-break: Murray*/Lopez 1-4 Ram/Salisbury (*denotes server): Salisbury gives another Murray serve the treatment, a forehand down the line too good for Lopez. First set tie-break: Murray*/Lopez 1-3 Ram/Salisbury (*denotes server): A smart Ram return draws an errant volley from a stooping Murray. First set tie-break: Murray/Lopez 1-2 Ram/Salisbury* (*denotes server): Ram makes up for it with a clever volley. First set tie-break: Murray/Lopez 1-1 Ram/Salisbury* (*denotes server): Ram volleys wide off a fierce Murray return. First set tie-break: Murray/Lopez* 0-1 Ram/Salisbury (*denotes server): Lopez butchers a smash! Put it down to fatigue. First set: Murray/Lopez 6-6 Ram*/Salisbury (*denotes server): Ram holds to love to force a tie-break. First set: Murray*/Lopez 6-5 Ram/Salisbury (*denotes server): After all that excitement Murray messes up the first point with one of his worst every volleys. 0-15. Yet Murray finds his serve again. He holds to 30, swinging one down the middle and out of Ram\u2019s reach. First set: Murray/Lopez 5-5 Ram/Salisbury* (*denotes server): Salisbury is serving for the set. It goes to 30-all and Lopez makes it 30-40 with a cracking forehand down the line. It\u2019s effectively two break points. But Ram is strong enough at the net to deal with a Murray backhand, Lopez unable to deal with it. A deciding point, then. But it\u2019s still a break point - and that\u2019s the cue for Murray\u2019s return to click into gear, a low forehand forcing Salisbury to volley long. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Murray roars. First set: Murray/Lopez* 4-5 Ram/Salisbury (*denotes server): Lopez is serving to keep the opening set alive. And he holds to 15. Sir Joe Salisbury will serve for it. First set: Murray/Lopez 3-5 Ram*/Salisbury (*denotes server): You sense a Ram service game offers an instant opportunity for Murray and Lopez to break back, a feeling that grows when the American finds himself down 0-30 again. But he responds with three straight points and holds thanks to a sharp volley from Salisbury. First set: Murray*/Lopez 3-4 Ram/Salisbury (*denotes server): Some wonderful doubles shenanigans at 0-15. Lopez has to scramble back to the baseline to reach a volley and he shows a surprising turn of pace to get there before hooking a deep forehand back into play, at which point Salisbury nets a smash. Murray\u2019s serve is coming under pressure, though, and he finds himself facing two break points when Salisbury pounces on a poor volley from the Scot. The rangy Salisbury\u2019s looking the sharpest player out there. And it\u2019s fitting that he\u2019s the one to seal the break with a lovely forehand down the line. \u201cCome on!\u201d he cries. First set: Murray/Lopez 3-3 Ram/Salisbury* (*denotes server): Lopez is stretching a fair bit during the changeover. He must be aching after his exertions. Meanwhile Murray\u2019s a little bit annoyed with his return at the moment. It\u2019s not quite there yet and it allows Salisbury to 40-15. Salisbury holds to 40-30 when a hopeful Murray lob drops long. First set: Murray/Lopez* 3-2 Ram/Salisbury (*denotes server): Lopez drops the first point on serve, but he rattles through the next three. Then he seals another hold with a crisp forehand volley. It\u2019s been a good, tight start to the final. First set: Murray/Lopez 2-2 Ram*/Salisbury (*denotes server): Salisbury\u2019s under fire at the net on the first point. Eventually he finds a Murray backhand too hot to handle. These are worrying times for Ram and Salisbury. A double-fault from Ram makes it 0-30. The American\u2019s not finding his first serve. But his second clicks just well enough to force 30-all. Then he clicks into gear, sending an ace down the middle for 40-30. The American holds. First set: Murray*/Lopez 2-1 Ram/Salisbury (*denotes server): Murray wins the first point easily enough. Then Lopez stands firm at the net to repel a Ram forehand with an accurate volley for 30-0. At 40-0 Ram drills a backhand return down the line. Lovely shot. That one\u2019s not coming back. Then Ram and Salisbury combine well to make it 40-30, the former\u2019s forehand volley doing the job. Yet Murray holds to 30 when he whacks a backhand from left to right at the net. First set: Murray/Lopez 1-1 Ram/Salisbury* (*denotes server): Joe Salisbury to serve. It would be understandable if he\u2019s feeling a bit nervous about sharing a court with a rather famous opponent. But the local lad has to ignore the Murray factor. The first two points are shared. It goes to 30-all. Then Salisbury bangs an ace down the middle for 40-30. But Murray responds with a fizzing backhand return down the line for deuce. In doubles it\u2019s a deciding point. And although the returners choose Salisbury has to deliver to Murray again, this time the serve\u2019s good enough to outfox the Scot. First set: Murray/Lopez* 1-0 Ram/Salisbury (*denotes server): It\u2019s the singles champion, Feliciano Lopez, to open the doubles final \u2013 and he makes a good start, racing through a few serves to set up a 40-0 lead. He doesn\u2019t look tired at all! Give it half an hour or so, though, then we\u2019ll see. Still, a hold to love. Tok! Tok! Tok! They\u2019re knocking up. Here come the players! This is what the crowd have been waiting for. The chance to see Joe Salisbury Andy Murray! The doubles final is going to begin at 5.30pm. Enough time for Feliciano Lopez to get a quick massage. Lopez adds he doesn\u2019t have much energy left. \u201cI\u2019m going to speak to Andy now. He\u2019s going to be responsible now.\u201d Feliciano Lopez, probably the first tournament director to win a tournament, speaks! \u201cThe whole match was very exciting, except the first set, where he didn\u2019t play very good. I took this set but then he got better and better and it was really tough for me. The tie-break at the end was a lottery and it went my way.\u201d Feliciano Lopez beams as he collects his trophy. It\u2019s a wonder if he can lift the trinket above his head. Feliciano Lopez has won the singles final! He\u2019s beaten Gilles Simon 6-2, 6-7, 7-6, but he has no time to put his feet up. Now he\u2019s got to play the doubles final with Sir Andy Murray. They take on Joe Salisbury and Rajeev Ram soon. Ashleigh Barty is the new world No1! The French Open champion beat Julia Goerges to claim the title in Birmingham earlier. The singles final is going to three sets. Gilles Simon has knuckled down and won the second on a tie-break. Andy Murray will have to wait. \u201cAfternoon Jacob,\u201d Simon McMahon says. \u201cI\u2019ve missed Andy. Tennis has missed Andy. To win a doubles title in his first tournament back just six months after career saving surgery would be quite something. To see him compete in Grand Slam singles in 2020 would be quite something else. And who\u2019s to say he won\u2019t win another one? Not me, that\u2019s for sure. COME ON ANDY!!!\u201d Tennis has missed Andy. It hasn\u2019t been as fun without him. It hasn\u2019t been Andy enough. Pre-match reading Feliciano Lopez has won the first set of the singles final 6-2. The man\u2019s a machine! Speaking of splendid 37-year-olds, by the way, elsewhere Roger Federer\u2019s won a record 10th Halle title after beating David Goffin in the final. Poor Joe Salisbury. Putney\u2019s finest reaches the doubles final at Queen\u2019s and who does he find waiting for him on the other side of the net? Andy Murray, that\u2019s who. Only the greatest British player of all time. How\u2019s your luck, Joe? What a story, though. Murray being Murray, of course, perhaps we should have expected this from him as he embarks on what almost counts as a second career after all the pain he\u2019s gone through. Six months ago, though, we were all writing the obituaries. Everyone remembers that emotional press conference before the Australian Open, when it seemed he was on the verge of retirement, and assumed he\u2019d played his final ever match when he lost to Roberto Bautista Agut in the first round in Melbourne. Only, it turned out Murray wasn\u2019t ready to say goodbye. He went under the knife again, switched the faulty hip for a metal one and set about preparing for a dramatic return. And here we are. With a man who was using his racquet as a crutch not so long ago in the doubles final in his first tournament back since hip surgery. It really is ridiculous. But that\u2019s Murray for you, always ready to surprise, never willing to give in without a fight. Having said that, mind you, what\u2019s stood out about this comeback is how happy he\u2019s looked on court so far. The limp and grimace have both gone and Murray just looks like he\u2019s delighted to be playing tennis again. He isn\u2019t fighting; he\u2019s just enjoying himself and it\u2019s delightful to watch. Not that the fiery competitive spirit has disappeared, of course. No chance of that happening. Instead Murray\u2019s making big plans. He\u2019s off to Eastbourne with Brazil\u2019s Marcelo Melo, then he\u2019s off to Wimbledon to play with the excellent Pierre Hugues-Herbert and he also wants a mixed doubles partner at SW19 (Serena? Venus? Judy?). The ultimate aim is to get back into singles. But before all that he needs to win this match. It might not be straightforward, though, given that his partner, the 37-year-old Feliciano Lopez, appears to be involved in a charity tennisathon. Yesterday Lopez reached the singles final after seeing off Canada\u2019s Felix Auger-Aliassime in three sets. Then he had a short break. Then he helped Murray polish off their rain-delayed quarter-final against Dan Evans and Ken Skupski. Then he helped Murray win their semi-final against Henri Kontinen and John Peers. It was almost 9pm by the time he was done. He must be knackered. What\u2019s more, the Spaniard has to get his singles final against Gilles Simon done before this match begins. Absurd. Who knows what state he\u2019ll be in by the end of the day? One thing\u2019s for sure: he\u2019s bound to be stiff and that could play work against him. Salisbury, a 27-year-old Londoner who reached the Wimbledon semis last year, and the USA\u2019s Rajeev Ram knocked out doubles legends the Bryans brothers yesterday. They aren\u2019t to be taken lightly. Play begins ... soon.",

L\u00f3pez had match point after 2hr 40min of a close struggle, but hit a tired forehand into the net and the Frenchman escaped again, taking them into another shootout. This time L\u00f3pez held his nerve, ecstatic to be champion again as he revelled in the applause of the packed Centre Court. Not a lot falls in his lap, though. When he beat Marin Cilic to win the title two years ago, he had to fight his way through a third-set tie-break \u2013 and his career has been marked by extended endeavour. Nobody in the post tie-break era has played in more five-setters when the score has been deadlocked at 6-6. At Wimbledon last year L\u00f3pez passed Roger Federer\u2019s record of 65 consecutive grand slam appearances. As he heads for the All England Club next week, that mark has moved on to 69. L\u00f3pez is 38 in September, six weeks younger than the Swiss \u2013 not as lauded, but certainly as respected. He is only the third player to win both the singles and doubles titles in the same year at Queen\u2019s Club, after Pete Sampras in 1995 and Mark Philippoussis in 1997.",

Ball, who was a friend of the Prince of Wales and other influential members of the establishment, was jailed in 2015 \u2013 more than 20 years after allegations were made against him that were largely ignored or downplayed by the church. Peter Hancock, the bishop of Bath and Wells and the Church of England\u2019s lead safeguarding bishop, said: \u201cWe have been made aware of the death of Peter Ball and our prayers and thoughts are with everyone affected by this news.\u201d Ball, who was bishop of Lewes and bishop of Gloucester, served 16 months of a 32-month sentence for sexual offences against 18 young men. He had resigned as a bishop and accepted a police caution in 1993 after allegations were made, but was allowed to continue officiating in the Church of England. Last month, the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA) said the Church of England had put its own reputation above the needs of abuse victims in the Ball case and there had been a a serious failure of leadership by the former archbishop of Canterbury George Carey. The inquiry also found misguided expressions of support for Ball by Prince Charles and other members of the establishment when the bishop was accused of sexual offences. Ball had \u201csought to use his relationship with His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales to further his campaign to return to unrestricted ministry\u201d, the 250-page report said.

In a written submission to the IICSA, Prince Charles said he had been deceived over a long period of time \u201cabout the true nature\u201d of Ball\u2019s activities, but denied he had sought to influence the outcome of police investigations.

HRW has written to the foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, urging her to push for a more active and creative presence on the council. \u201cAustralia should treat its membership in the UN human rights council as both an opportunity and responsibility to be a leader in defending human rights abroad and at home,\u201d said Elaine Pearson, Australia director at HRW. \u201cPromoting human rights values includes publicly raising rights issues with foreign leaders, not just making generic statements of concern in Geneva.\u201d In its letter, HRW noted that Australia has often preferred a \u201cquiet diplomacy\u201d style of advocating for human rights improvements with other countries, but said it needed to increase its public pressure \u201cto ensure that private discussions are not used to shield violators from international scrutiny\u201d. \u201cAustralia has for the most part voted in favour of country resolutions to establish accountability mechanisms for crisis situations, but has not yet taken the next step,\u201d the letter said.

As is often the case, Jamaica\u2019s chances may well sit on Fowler\u2019s broad shoulders \u2013 with little world-class back-up. Her bookend in the national side, Thunderbird Shamera Sterling, will no doubt translate her red-hot Super Netball form to the world stage too. The English Roses of Harten, Geva Mentor, Chelsea Pitman, Helen Housby and Layla Guscoth all had full games in the last round for their respective sides and will soon join their national team-mates in the UK \u2013 and no doubt continue, as Pitman did today, to say they\u2019re underdogs for the world title. Given the Roses are reigning Commonwealth Games gold medallists, it\u2019s hard to see how they can pitch themselves that way. Regardless of labels, in about 28 sleeps, there will be only one side left on the dance floor.",

      "bodyText": "Labor is demanding Peter Dutton release the details of a review into contracts worth almost $500m to manage the Manus Island offshore processing centre, before the Morrison government approves the next one, expected to occur in days. The home affairs minister has been forced to defend his department\u2019s awarding Paladin, a previously little known firm, a series of contracts to manage the Papua New Guinea off-shore processing centre, without a tender process. In total, the government has awarded $423m in contracts to Paladin to manage the centre, at a cost of at least $1,600 per day for each refugee and asylum seeker, without food or medical care, with a renewal expected by the end of the month. But the shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, is demanding Dutton first release the findings of an Ernst &amp; Young audit into the contracts, which was ordered in March, and expected to take just seven weeks. The reported $125,000 review was to examine the \u201ctendering and procurement processes\u201d associated with the Paladin contract and was expected to be finished by the end of last month. Keneally said no moves to renew the contract should be made until the review\u2019s findings were made public. \u201cPeter Dutton has had five years to find the right service providers for PNG, yet he\u2019s failed at every turn, wasting taxpayers money in the process and also impacting the care of asylum seekers and refugees,\u201d she said. \u201cPeter Dutton likes to keep secrets but it is unthinkable that he would continue to hide the finding of the Ernst &amp; Young audit report into Paladin from taxpayers, just as he prepares to again award Paladin a multimillion-dollar contract extension. \u201cScott Morrison has the ability to overrule Peter Dutton to release the Ernst &amp; Young report to give the community confidence that Mr Dutton is making the right decisions.\u201d Dutton\u2019s office was contacted for comment. In an interview early last week, Dutton said \u201cthe likelihood is there\u2019s a continuation\u201d when he was asked about the Paladin contract. \u201cI\u2019m not going to comment when the department is in the process of the arrangements,\u201d he told the ABC on 16 June. Following reporting in the Australian Financial Review, Labor and the Greens pursued the matter in subsequent estimates hearings, where home affairs boss Mike Pezzullo said an \u201curgent\u201d set of circumstances led to the contract being renewed until July this year. Pezzullo told the estimates hearing officials turned to Paladin in a closed tender process, after the department was advised by the PNG government in July last year it could not provide the necessary services. But that too has changed, with the PNG government advising it expects to \u201ccancel or terminate\u201d the contract by the end of the month, as it believes it has the skills and expertise to now run the centre. \u201cPNG government wants a transparent tender process and most importantly will strongly recommended national content,\u201d PNG\u2019s immigration minister, Petrus Thomas, said in a letter to the home affairs department last month. \u201cPapua New Guinean companies now have the capacity and expertise to do the job and should be given the opportunity to participate.\u201d The contract row comes as Labor re-centres its attacks against the government\u2019s border security policies by focusing on the cost to taxpayers and how that money is being spent, while the government ramps up its rhetoric against the medevac legislation it hopes to repeal when parliament resumes next month. Late last week, Dutton accused women of \u201ctrying it on\u201d to reach Australia through the medevac legislation. \u201cLet\u2019s be serious about this. There are people who have claimed that they\u2019ve been raped and came to Australia to seek an abortion because they couldn\u2019t get an abortion on Nauru,\u201d he told Sky News on 20 June. \u201cThey arrived in Australia and then decided they were not going to have an abortion. They have the baby here and the moment they step off the plane their lawyers lodge papers in the federal court which injuncts us from sending them back.\u201d But Labor and the Greens have rejected Dutton and the government\u2019s claims the medevac laws were failing. On Friday the Guardian reported that of the nine cases the minister had rejected on medical reasons, the independent panel chosen by the government had overturned just two of those decisions. Without Labor\u2019s support, the government needs four crossbenchers to agree to repeal the legislation, making Jacqui Lambie the likely deciding vote.",

They also have Charlie Dixon, who played his first game for the year after breaking his leg in last year\u2019s round 21 loss to West Coast.</p> <p>Cats fans will hardly be upset though, they\u2019re still sitting a game (and significant percentage) clear at the top of the ladder.

Howard also \u201cchopped out\u201d with an off-the-ball right jab to the breadbasket of Cats veteran Harry Taylor. But where Geelong really got cursed was winning the hard ball. Port Adelaide had 36 more contested possessions than their highly rated opponents and won the stoppage clearances 41-28 (and overall clearances 52-36). Between them, Robbie Gray, Travis Boak and Lycett combined for more than a quarter of the Power\u2019s contested possessions and more than half of their clearances. Tall shutdown defender and Alipate Carlile legatee Tom Clurey didn\u2019t post big numbers but was every bit as impressive in keeping Geelong\u2019s Tom Hawkins\u2019 goalless. Saturday night\u2019s win at the Adelaide Oval \u2013 after a month that has seen them play in Launceston, China and Perth \u2013 moves Port Adelaide back into the top eight with a 7-6 record and the belief that they can match it with any team in the competition. They also have Charlie Dixon, who played his first game for the year after breaking his leg in last year\u2019s round 21 loss to West Coast. Cats fans will hardly be upset though, they\u2019re still sitting a game (and significant percentage) clear at the top of the ladder. Besides, the only curse you need to worry about in today\u2019s AFL is the imbecilic one that\u2019ll have a behavioural awareness officer eject you from Marvel Stadium.",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s been utter madness to cover that one, to be fair. I was bashing fingers all over the keyboard. Thanks for all your fine contributions on VAR and everything else. If you want you can join me in a bit for France v Brazil. MADNESS! So to go through from Phil Neville there. He is certainly not happy and it\u2019s fair enough. England will just be pleased they got through that. Neville: \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like football. It was a good win, we played OK. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t football in terms of the behaviour. This is going out worldwide! I didn\u2019t enjoy it, my players didn\u2019t enjoy it.\u201d \u201cThere are young girls out there seeing that behaviour and it\u2019s not right.\u201d How much sympathy did you have for them? \u201cNone!\u201d \u201cI think the referee took pity on them as we should have had a penalty and them a player sent off.\u201d \u201cI am proud of my players for having discipline and going out and playing football.\u201d Scathing from Phil. Here is the report ... Well, well, well. What a fun encounter in Valenciennes. England never really got going in this match but have come out of it with a really simple win but that is not the story. VAR has taken centre stage once again and the reaction of the Cameroon players to the second goal will be remembered for a long time to come. 90+8 mins: Takounda with a horrible stamp on Houghton who lands on the Cameroon coach in the technical area. It was a needless challenge at this stage of the game. Onguene is right in the referee\u2019s face again. Not a great day for Cameroon this. We are going to VAR for the challenge as it was a red card. The referee gives Takounda a yellow, despite it looking like a red to me. Let\u2019s just get this done with. 90+4 mins: Good news everyone! I was right in my preamble: 90+2 mins: Sue Smith gives Steph Houghton player of the match, which is fair enough. She took her goal well and has ensured Cameroon have caused few problems at the back. Andy Bradshaw on VAR: \u201cIn regards to VAR, the main issue is the fact no one knows the decision process. In cricket they went through this process and it\u2019s taken nearly 10years to get it to a point where the third umpire is heard by everyone and you can see what they\u2019re looking at and can usually work out how they\u2019ve reached the decision. This is sometimes ruined by the waste of carbon operating the tech, but it\u2019s usually fine and works pretty seamlessly.\u201d 90 mins: Seven minutes added on. Cheers VAR. 89 mins: Cameroon are still battling here to get a goal but just can\u2019t find that clinical pass in the final third. A cross bounces off Greenwood for a corner. 87 mins: Not a classic end to the game here. 85 mins: Onguene shows a flash of brilliance to go round an England midfielder but she can\u2019t find the final pass and England crowd her out. Tony Reekie on VAR: \u201cIn the old days of one or two months ago the referee and assistants would have made those decisions right or wrong as they were borderline and the game would have carried on. Some of the VAR decisions in this match have been dodgy and it has utterly killed the game. Progress eh?\u201d 83 mins: Taylor almost gets a goal with a little dink beyond the onrushing goalkeeper but Johnson chases it down and clears it off the line for a corner. 81 mins: Parris finds space out wide and sends in a low cross for the waiting Taylor but the goalkeeper reads it claims the ball. Michael Konopka joins the debate: \u201cA lot of the VAR decisions that people seem to have issues with seem to be the result of interpreting slow motion video of the event. It leads to decisions being made based on millimeters or makes tackles appear more violent or egregious than they do in real speed. Require that reviews must be made at full speed and if it can\u2019t be determined from that, go with call on the field.\u201d 79 mins: Chris McVandi sums up our opinions: \u201cVAR is Very Annoying Replay.\u201d 77 mins: Kirby and Parris combine, before the former lays it onto Taylor in space but her shot is pretty atrocious and goes well wide. Kirby was possibly fouled in the area and we\u2019re going to VAR. Looks like it\u2019s going to be a penalty ... Kirby got caught on her foot after the ball had gone. The referee takes her time and gives a goal kick. I have no idea anymore. Maybe it was a diplomatic decision. 74 mins: All very bitty now. Not a great spectacle. 72 mins: All quiet in Valenciennes at the moment. Joachem Blad on VAR: \u201cI cannot understand everyone complaining about VAR! If VAR wasn\u2019t there today, a completely fine England goal would have been disallowed and a marginally offside Cameroon goal would have stood, influencing the game hugely. The game is a lot more fair with VAR than it was without, a fact somehow quite often overlooked...\u201d VAR is good for my inbox, that\u2019s for sure. 70 mins: A pretty tame cross is sent into the box where Ngo Ndom comes to claim under no pressure but drops the ball, allowing Taylor to take possession. England fail to make the most of it and the ball is scrambled away. 68 mins: Bronze goes on a run through the middle but is met on the edge of the area by Onguene who ensures she goes no further with a crunching tackle. Down the other end an offside Abam races onto a pass, goes clean through but her low drive is saved by Bardsley. It does not matter anyway as the flag is put up in the end. 66 mins: Scott sends Kirby away down the right but the Chelsea player\u2019s cross is a poor one, allowing Cameroon to cut it out. Ian Plenderleith states: \u201cThe VAR was consulted or intervened four times in the first half during Germany-Nigeria yesterday. I was in the stadium, and it got to the point where the large parts of the crowd started booing every time the ref put her finger to her ear. Resistance from the masses! Despite Fifa\u2018s reffing coordinator Pierluigi Collina claiming it\u2018s been a success, the view from anyone not working for Fifa is that VAR needs a serious re-think, at the very least.\u201d 64 mins: A Cameroon corner is lifted into the box where Takounda attempts an overhead kick but she completely misses her shot and England clear the danger. Taylor comes on for White, meaning England now have 1 to 11 on the pitch, which is an exciting prospect. Tor Turner emails: \u201cTo add to your overflowing mails on the subject, I\u2019d like to suggest that for marginal VAR calls like that one, they should introduce something similar to how \u201cUmpire\u2019s Call\u201d works in cricket reviews. \u201cDistance &lt; a certain value offside (6 inches maybe) should be down to the ref on the grounds that the differential is so marginal, unless there\u2019s an obvious advantage in play by being just offside (like evading an offside trap manoeuvre by defenders), the original decision stands. Would allow for more nuance in the face of scenarios like that one. England looking rocky here. Against Norway I\u2019m not feeling our chances. And that\u2019s assuming we don\u2019t do a Scotland/England men\u2019s cricket team and snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.\u201d 62 mins: Kirby clips the ball through to White in the area, the striker spins and lifts the ball over the goalkeeper but it loops beyond the bar. 60 mins: Nchout gets the ball in the box, works it onto her left foot but she does not hit her shot cleanly and it squirms to Greenwood on the edge of her own six-yard box and she whacks it clear. Duggan tries to wriggle through a couple of defenders but the ball ends up going behind for a corner. Duggan sends in a low cross to Greenwood who runs onto it and smashes it into the net. What a well-worked corner. Game over here. 55 mins: A long ball is sent over the top for Takounda to chase, Bardsley hesitates and the ball is lofted over her but Greenwood recovers and clears before a belated offside flag is raised. 53 mins: There are boos from the crowd. I am not exactly sure who they are from, though. This is all getting a bit tetchy. Takounda, seconds after coming on, latches onto an atrocious backpass from Greenwood but Bardsley stays big and blocks the shot. What a chance that was! Mark emails in: \u201cCan we please stop using VAR for offside, UNLESS it\u2019s to correct an obvious error? If a player is so marginally offside the referee andlinespersoncan\u2019t spot it, it is giving the player no strategic advantage. It\u2019s simply spoiling the game and it isn\u2019t what the off side rule was designed to do. Now officials are under pressure to spot everything as all their decisions are so publicly exposed. I strongly suspect without VAR England\u2019s goal would not have been flagged, and can one really believe Cameroon wouldn\u2019t have scored if the player had been half a foot further back?\u201d 51 mins: The offside in the England goal was not tight, this one was incredibly narrow even if it was the right call, which is adding to anger. Nchout is crying on the pitch. The players are rightly emotional but the referee has to take control of the situation here. 49 mins: NO GOAL! Cameroon take advantage of a poor kick from Bardlsey, sending in a cross for Nchout to fire beyond the England goalkeeper. It goes to VAR for an offside in the buildup to the goal ... and it\u2019s ruled out! This will not please Cameroon, especially as she was offside by a millimetre. It\u2019s all kicking off on the sideline. 47 mins: A quiet start to the second half, which is a relief to all concerned. Here we go again! Adrien Dunnion says: \u201cAlso, Kuwait refused to play after Giresse scored against them in 1982, then France refused to play when the ref overturned the decision.\u201d Good news! Cameroon are back out on the pitch. Hopefully they\u2019ll be kind enough to play the second half. We have more on France circa 1982 ... There is someone out there with a greater memory than me ... \u201cDo I remember France having a grand sulk after a goal was disallowed against Kuwait 1982?\u201d Roger Kay asks. Julian Menz says: \u201cYes, the goal was rightly given, but it just goes to show, once again, that the current offside law is a complete ass. \u201cThe goalscorer was obviously onside, but one England player was clearly offside. She might not have been \u201ddirectly\u201d involved at that moment, but the defence and goalkeeper still have to take that player\u2019s potential threat into account, and react to the situation accordingly. \u201cThe mere presence of an attacking player in a threatening position means that said player is very much involved in how the passage of play progresses.\u201d They might be harsh on Cameroon as they are pretty cynical on the pitch. They were lucky not to have someone sent off for an elbow today. Rudi asks: \u201cHas it ever happened that a team refused to play on during a world cup match? If so, what happened? \u201cJust wondering as I\u2019m watching the game. Greetings from the Netherlands!\u201d I can\u2019t think of any ... From our reporter at the match ... According to the BBC the Cameroon players have complained in the tunnel about racism in relation to the second goal being given. It was clearly onside! Claire McConnell on the band: \u201cIt IS there, because after about 15 minutes I said to my son \u201cat least that bloody band isn\u2019t there, and just 2 minutes later they started up.\u201d Cnoyes says: \u201cTo quote Phil Neville I see nothing in this England team that gives me fear. They have been poor. Cameroon almost seem surprised at how much of the play they have been given. Playing like this, England will lose to the first good team they play in this tournament.\u201d Cameroon update: they had a post-whistle huddle and a little chat. I suspect they will be moaning a lot in the dressing room, too. Joe Pearson emails: Either that or my tv coverage is slightly delayed, as you occasionally report things before they happen in front of my eyes. Yes, yes I am. England deserve to be ahead but if we\u2019re being honest they haven\u2019t actually been very good. They haven\u2019t tested the goalkeeper apart form the goals, which is an odd thing to say. Cameroon have been pretty poor, mainly just trying to kick England and disrupt play, not to mention their reaction to the goal. 45+6 mins: The Cameroon team are refusing to restart the match, claiming the goal should not have been allowed. They have shouted at the ref and she has spoken to the captain who is explaining to her teammates why the goal was given. This is farcical and mildly pathetic. The referee has to put a stop to this. Bronze knocks the ball through to White in plenty of space on the edge of the box, the England striker turns and puts the ball into the bottom corner. The flag is put up but it turns out that she is at least half a yard onside and it goes up to VAR, with the goal understandably given. 45+2 mins: Kirby releases White in the box but her shot is blocked by the covering defender. Duggan sends the subsequent corner straight out of play. 45 mins: Four minutes added on. Tim says via email: \u201cWatching in Denmark, is that bloody band still trumping out the cliche songs, or is it just an aberration on Dansk TV channel 3? Good game last night with the old enemy sorting out England\u2019s old enemy.\u201d I think the Cameroon fans have some drums and whistles but nothing that could be described as a band. While Johnson is treated, someone has sent in some actual analysis. 44 mins: Ejangue performs an overhead kick to clear the ball from inside the area, much to the appreciation of the crowd. Johnson is down with an ankle injury after Kirby caught her. Yes, you missed the rule change. 42 mins: The ball is whacked into Kirby on the halfway line but it bounces of her foot and goes 10 yards backwards towards a Cameroon player as they counter again. England see what is coming, regroup and get the ball back. England really need to up it here. 40 mins: The ball is whacked towards the dugouts and the Cameroon coach tries to catch it but he has reactions of Massimo Taibi and it bounces off his shoulder and past him. 38 mins: England are looking a touch sloppy here and need to keep hold of the ball better. I think the physicality of Cameroon means they want to play it quicker before the inevitable late challenge. 36 mins: It still surprised me when a goal-kick is knocked to someone inside the area. Cameroon do a short goal-kick and then naturally whack it aimlessly long. 34 mins: Duggan looks to attack down the left but is forced a long way back and the ball ends up with Cameroon who counter. It looks like it\u2019s about to get dangerous until Enganamouit tries another optimistic shot from distance but falls over and England take possession once more. 32 mins: Greenwood is caught in possession and she tries to rectify her mistake but only succeeds in holding back Abam and a free-kick is awarded 35 yards or so from goal. Enganamouit whacks the set-piece towards goal but it goes a long way over. 30 mins: David Wall on cowards: \u201cAs well as VAR being used pathetically in this World Cup, it also seems to have made the referees into cowards. That elbow was hardly subtle and the referee (or at least the assistant) should have spotted that and sent the player off, without the need for VAR (they made this point at half time in the Germany - Nigeria game yesterday, how the ref didn\u2019t think that was a penalty herself is beyond belief). And what happened to playing advantage and then going back to book players for bad fouls in the build up? In that move leading up to Duggan\u2019s effort on 22 minutes one of the England players (I couldn\u2019t see who, I think it was Parris - are they targeting her?) was completely cleaned out after flicking the ball on.\u201d 28 mins: England are just popping the ball about, moving Cameroon about as they look to bide their time here. It\u2019s all happening in the middle of the pitch until it\u2019s sprayed out to Parris who sends in a cross which is deflected into the goalkeeper\u2019s arms. 26 mins: England are far better than Cameroon who just looking to knock it long without any form of success. Cameroon can neither time a pass or a challenge. Arlo Katts points out: \u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time I saw an indirect free kick in the penalty area!\u201d I might propose a Guardian Joy of Six on indirect free-kicks. 24 mins: Scott and Onguene clash in the middle of the pitch. The Cameroon midfielder has gone down with something or other and the ball is eventually kicked out. It allows everyone to get some water onboard at least as Onguene hobbles off. 22 mins: A lovely move from England ends with Duggan getting space on the edge of the box but her shot curls just wide of the post. 20 mins: Scott and Leuko have a good old fashioned battle for the ball, resulting in Cameroon getting a soft free-kick. It\u2019s good for England to show they can compete if it gets physical. 18 mins: Scott tries to send a pass to Parris down the line but it has far too much on it and flies out of play. Jeffrey Lilly has emailed in: \u201cWatching from the USA today, and appreciating the Guardian\u2019s usual unmatched excellent coverage of the sport. Despite the whiny ravings of a minority of certain fragile men, I love soccer in all of its forms. The women\u2019s game has a different feel than the men\u2019s but is no less interesting or dramatic. I also love sporting events like this and the Olympics that bring together nations and cultures. If there\u2019s hope for humanity yet, these events are important reminders that we can all come together to play by a universal set of rules and compete without killing or stealing from each other.\u201d 16 mins: A very silly bit of incompetence from the Cameroon defence has let them down here, hopefully they won\u2019t try to get over it by getting more physical. We have a long time to wait after the Cameroon players struggle to understand that they need to be on the line. During the commotion Duggan complains that Ejangue has spat on her (I think it was an accident when shouting). In the end the indirect free-kick from six yards out is tapped to Houghton who calmly slots the ball into the corner with 11 Cameroon players running at her! 12 mins: White latches onto a pass and whacks a cross along the six-yard box towards Duggan but it is intercepted by Ejangue who only succeeds in knocking the ball back to her \u2018keeper and it\u2019s a backpass. England have an extra fan. 10 mins: Duggan sends in a cross but it is cleared out to Parris who can\u2019t find a way through to goal from the edge of the area and Cameroon sweep up once again. Parris then gets to the byline and lifts one to the front post which is easily gathered. Re the elbow ... 8 mins: Cameroon are already wasting time and when they do have the ball just send it very long without much of an aim. 6 mins: Cameroon are looking to play on the break in this match and therefore barely had a kick. Charles Antaki questions more of the selection choices today: \u201cThe BBC has the ruminative, side-trackable Jonatan Pierce commenting - shame they\u2019ve not stuck with Robyn Cowen, who\u2019s been excellent so far - direct, concise, relaxed, and less given to distraction. Unlikely as it is, this could be England\u2019s last game here, so it would be a shame not at least be seen out by a female commentator.\u201d 4 mins: Parris tries to go round Leuko who whacks her elbow into the England winger\u2019s face. She is booked but surely it needs to go up to VAR as that is a red card! But nothing happens because the use of VAR in this tournament has been pathetic. 2 mins: England are looking to keep possession early on here and they know they will have a lot of the ball today, not to mention the fact that it is pretty warm at pitch level, so they won\u2019t want to overexert themselves too much. Feudjio clatters into Bronze, just for fun. Could be a physical game. Let\u2019s get ready to rumble!! Phil West wants to chat more Lineker v Cameroon in 1990: \u201cI watched that game at my fiancee\u2019s house in Istanbul - one of the most stressful England games ever! For the only time in my life I walked out of the room when GL had his second penalty - just couldn\u2019t watch!! Let\u2019s hope that doesn\u2019t happen tonight!btw - still married 29 years later!!\u201d Phil\u2019s been married almost as long as I\u2019ve been alive ... The anthems are being pumped out in Valenciennes. The stadium looks pretty much full, which is great news for the game. Suzanne Wrack is at the game where it looks pretty warm ... POWER! Dion Dublin says England need to keep their discipline and cannot be drawn into a physical battle. England are the better side here so need to just play their own way. The big man himself has been on ... A US fan has filed some needle in my inbox: \u201cSo which member of this England team is tasked with the Lineker role of falling over in the box when this Cameroon team proves more than a pushover?\u201d We are all waiting for the first VAR of the day! I am a big Demi Stokes fan having seen quite a few Man City games last season, so I am surprised she is seen as second-choice left-back in this team. Alex Greenwood has looked good when she has played, though, so merits the chance to start in the knockout stages. James Anderson has been in touch: \u201chi my name is james Anderson and i hope England women will win the game.\u201d Good to hear ... Steph Houghton is confident of Karen Bardsley\u2019s ability when it comes to saving penalties if a shootout is required. \u201cKB is probably the most prepared keeper I\u2019ve ever played with,\u201d the defender said. \u201cThe keepers do a lot of work. We\u2019ve got four great keepers. KB showed what she was about (against Japan), Carly did the same against Argentina. \u201cWhen those moments matter, people step up and they\u2019re the match winners. For me, if it came to a shoot-out then I\u2019d have full faith in the keepers we have.\u201d It\u2019s a knockout! Rob Harris emails in his disdain: \u201cJust seen the England team sheet and amazed he has left their only authentic playmaker Karen Carney on the bench again. Kirby has a tendency to give the ball away and make the wrong decisions and England improved significantly when Carney replaced her against Argentina, and also when she came on against France. Neville is supposed to rate her highly but it seems not.\u201d A bit of a chat with Karen Carney ... A slightly frustrating lineup for England, as it is almost a perfect 1 to 11 but Ellen White starting over Jodie Taylor means we have No 18 on the pitch, rather than the No 9. What a shame for tradition. Nchout scored twice in the win over New Zealand and is Cameroon\u2019s main threat. Njie Enow tells us more about the forward ... Neville has gone with Kirby over Stanway despite the Chelsea player\u2019s performance during the tournament. One assumes Kirby will be motivated to prove her worth to the team on a day like this. A night of firsts ... What\u2019s keeping Phil Neville up at night? Not much really ... England: Bardsley, Bronze, Houghton, Bright, Greenwood, Walsh, Scott, Parris, Kirby, Duggan, White Cameroon: Ngo Ndom, Nchout, Leuko, Ejangue, Johnson, Aboudi Onguene, Feudjio, Yango, Awona, Enganamouit, Abam Good afternoon! The knockout stages are upon us and it\u2019s a key date in Phil Neville\u2019s calendar as the Lionesses look to show what they\u2019re made of when it really matters. After get through a tough group without reaching fifth gear, the players know there is plenty more to come. Neville says he is yet to see anything that scares him at this World Cup. Cameroon really shouldn\u2019t put much fear into this England side, but they have shown they can mix it with the best in France. They beat New Zealand in dramatic fashion to get this far and the Kiwis saw off England in a recent friendly, which is a sign of the danger that they offer. The football will probably all be irrelevant and we\u2019ll just be discussing VAR for the 90 minutes anyway.",

      "bodyText": "Jofra Archer has said he will put his friendship with Australia\u2019s Steve Smith on hold when England attempt to get their World Cup campaign back into gear at Lord\u2019s on Tuesday. The shock defeat to Sri Lanka at Headingley last Friday has put England\u2019s hopes of reaching the semi\u2011finals back in the balance, with victories in two of their final three games against Australia, India and New Zealand likely to be needed to secure their passage to the last four. The stakes for this latest encounter have been raised further by the lurking presence of the Ashes series that comes after the World Cup. So potential psychological points for the challenges ahead as well as qualification for the latter stages of this tournament will be on offer at Lord\u2019s. For Archer, the Barbados-born fast bowler who qualified to play for England in March, this will also be an opportunity to stake his own claim for an Ashes place as well as trying to add to the 15 wickets he has already taken in this World Cup. Smith would be a prize wicket to add to the collection for Archer and he will be helped by the inside knowledge he gained playing under the Australian\u2019s captaincy for Rajasthan Royals in this year\u2019s Indian Premier League. The pair are, according to Archer, friends. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like to consider he thinks of me the same way as well. He\u2019s a really good guy.\u201d However, the mood changes when asked how that personal relationship will affect the dynamic between the pair when they face each other at Lord\u2019s. \u201cCricket is cricket and I guess it\u2019s time to be friends after,\u201d he said. \u201cBut until the game is over there will be nothing friendly about it.\u201d Archer also let slip that Smith had actively avoided facing his 90mph-plus bowling at net sessions during their time as teammates in India. \u201cTo be honest, I didn\u2019t bowl at him much,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of the guys probably don\u2019t want to face me in the nets. They like the side-arm and the throws.\u201d Another Rajasthan player in the England all-rounder Ben Stokes also knows Smith well and Archer suggested the pair will formulate plans to get the better of the Australian, who scored a match-winning century during a pre-tournament warm-up match against England in Southampton last month. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing,\u201d said Archer. \u201cWhen you play with them you pick up on things you won\u2019t normally notice when you\u2019re just playing against them. So hopefully me and Ben, we can get together. We probably know what to do when he\u2019s in.\u201d Smith and David Warner both received hostile receptions during that warm-up match in Southampton from English fans keen to let the pair know their thoughts on the year-long bans the pair served for ball-tampering during the Cape Town Test against South Africa last year. The atmosphere at Lord\u2019s is likely to be more civil but England\u2019s players are keen to make an impression in the first major skirmish of this Ashes summer. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty up for it,\u201d said Archer. \u201cThey\u2019re second in the table so more than likely they will go through. I think if we could beat them now, if we do have to play them after [in the World Cup] we\u2019ll be OK.\u201d Archer also shrugged aside questions about the added pressure on England \u2013 the tournament hosts and No 1-ranked team \u2013following the Sri Lanka match. \u201cThe pressure has been on from the very first game,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the World Cup so there are no easy teams and no easy games as we saw from the last one. \u201c It is a chance to really see where our game is, having probably the three hardest games last. If we do get through we should be OK to pretty much win everything.\u201d Justin Langer, Australia\u2019s coach, was also keen to stress England\u2019s quality in what appeared a not-very thinly veiled attempt at mind games. \u201cWe have seen how they played for four years,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are the best team in the world. Just look at their team. Nothing has changed in a week.\u201d Whether or not Australia will have to face Jason Roy at Lord\u2019s remains to be seen. The England opener will on Monday have a further scan on the hamstring he tore nine days ago but it is understood his recovery is going well and he may yet play.",

Partnership agreements have brought increases in passenger numbers to towns and cities from Brighton (up 21% over the past decade) to Bristol (up 50%) and Liverpool (up 16% in just four years).</p> <p>What all of these successful partnership agreements have in common is a focus on putting the bus first on our congested roads. Local authorities have invested in measures to reduce bus journey times, enabling operators to run more frequent, more reliable services. The principal reason people don\u2019t use buses is that congestion means they\u2019re too slow and journey times too unpredictable. Fixing that, rather than debating whether it\u2019s shareholders or council tax payers who take the risk of running bus services, is the real key to a better deal for passengers.<br><strong>Graham Vidler</strong><br><em>Chief executive, </em><em>Confederation of Passenger Transport </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/15/share-your-best-photographs-of-the-week-with-us\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Click here</em></strong></a><strong><em> to upload it and we\u2019ll publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition</em></strong></p> <p><em> UK</em></p>",

Duncan Roberts Belford, Northumberland \u2022 While the Business Disability Forum fully supports the need to address air pollution in London as an urgent issue, we would question how a car-free day would affect those with a disability (Mayor of London plans biggest car-free day yet, 20 June). Many disabled people are reliant on adapted vehicles, cars driven by carers and taxis to get about in London because public transport remains inaccessible and pavements are overcrowded. This point was recognised by the Department of Transport when it announced the extension of the blue badge parking scheme (Blue badges to be available for \u2018invisible\u2019 disabilities, 15 June). We would ask the mayor to consider how disabled people can take part in this campaign. Improving the accessibility of London first is surely the answer. Angela Matthews Head of policy and research, Business Disability Forum \u2022 Re your editorial (21 June), there are numerous examples across the country where local authorities and bus operators have worked together to improve bus services (the responsibility of operators) and the infrastructure supporting buses (the responsibility of local authorities). Partnership agreements have brought increases in passenger numbers to towns and cities from Brighton (up 21% over the past decade) to Bristol (up 50%) and Liverpool (up 16% in just four years). What all of these successful partnership agreements have in common is a focus on putting the bus first on our congested roads. Local authorities have invested in measures to reduce bus journey times, enabling operators to run more frequent, more reliable services. The principal reason people don\u2019t use buses is that congestion means they\u2019re too slow and journey times too unpredictable. Fixing that, rather than debating whether it\u2019s shareholders or council tax payers who take the risk of running bus services, is the real key to a better deal for passengers.

      "bodyText": "British ambassadors have been sending messages to the Foreign Office describing Brexit as a political shambles that is destroying the UK\u2019s reputation, the serving UK ambassador to South Korea has said. In the latest sign of Foreign Office dissent at the direction of British foreign policy, Simon Smith said no serious decision-maker or opinion-former in South Korea thinks the UK\u2019s decision to leave the EU is a good idea, and that most South Koreans viewed Brexit with either bemusement or deep and serious incredulity. The comments are likely to alarm ministers as they seek to persuade their European counterparts that the country is united behind the Conservative plan to take the country of out of the EU in October. Addressing an audience at the thinktank Chatham House, Smith said he regarded it as his job to tell the Foreign Office what most people in South Korea thought of Brexit, and not to hide from the elephant in the room. Speaking on the record Smith opened his talk by referring to leaked remarks made by the now retired high commissioner to Singapore, and former UK ambassador to South Korea, Scott Wightman, whose scathing valedictory assessment of Brexit was leaked two weeks ago. Smith said: \u201cSome of you will have seen my predecessor\u2018s thoughts on all this, and all I will say on that, is he has not said anything but what quite a number of us have been saying to our government for the last year or so. \u201cIt is my job to tell things as I see it in Korea and, to \u2026 more or less quote from a note I wrote last year and sent to London, I have not really met a serious decision-maker or opinion-former in the Republic of Korea that thinks Brexit is a good idea. I have encountered what is characterisable as a spectrum from mild bemusement about Brexit to really quite serious and deep incredulity on the other end of the spectrum.\u201d Smith\u2019s assessment has just been released on a Chatham House podcast. Wightman is now director of external affairs for the Scottish government. His leaked remarks were praised by recently retired UK ambassador to Libya, Peter Millett, who tweeted: \u201cI would expect most of my former colleagues to share Scott Wightman\u2019s view of Brexit. Behind the scenes it is important for diplomats to challenge the current blind debate.\u201d Despite his frank reportage of the South Korean view of Brexit, Smith highlighted that the UK has managed in the last fortnight to finally sign off a critically important bilateral trade deal with the country that will largely replicate most aspects of the existing EU-South Korea free trade deal introduced in 2011.

He claimed the deal contained most of the advantageous aspects of the existing EU-South Korea free trade agreement. Britain is Seoul\u2019s second-largest trading partner among the EU members and its 18th-largest trading partner globally. Smith said the current trade volumes between two such major economies was not very good and could be improved, but added the number of South Korean students likely to study in the UK was set to be held back in the years ahead due to the \u201cuncertainty factor\u201d created by Brexit.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump was accused of using fearful migrants as \u201cpolitical pawns\u201d, after postponing planned weekend raids and mass deportations of people in the US illegally. The president granted a two-week reprieve to up to 2,000 families who were due to be targeted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents, following a request from Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives. But Trump said in a tweet on Sunday the raids would go ahead later this month if Democrats did not allow him to tighten laws to make it more difficult for people to claim asylum in the US. \u201cProbably won\u2019t happen, but worth a try,\u201d Trump said. \u201cTwo weeks and big Deportation begins!\u201d While activists expressed relief at the passing of immediate danger, many condemned Trump\u2019s casual handling of a decision that could lead to migrant parents being taken from children born in the US. \u201cThis is all a game to him while people live in deep fear,\u201d said Vanita Gupta, president and chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. \u201cHuman beings as political pawns.\u201d The raids were expected on Sunday in major cities such as Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco. Some city authorities had said they would not cooperate. Mark Morgan, acting director of Ice, said the agency would target families that had already received a removal order from an immigration court. Pelosi said in a tweet that while the delay was welcomed, \u201ctime is needed for comprehensive immigration reform\u201d. Trump\u2019s climbdown followed threats from Democrats in Congress to withhold $4.5bn in funding for law enforcement and humanitarian aid at the US-Mexican border, where there has been a surge in migrant arrivals. Many are fleeing violence in Central America. The president, whose 2016 campaign was built around the demonisation of migrants and a promise to build a wall along the entire southern border, has been enraged by the increase in illegal border crossings, which reached a 13-year high of more than 144,000 last month. Trump has repeatedly railed against US immigration laws for preventing him from simply blocking unwanted people and from immediately deporting people found to be in the US without authorisation. He frequently describes longstanding law allowing migrants to declare they are refugees and attempt to claim asylum as a \u201cloophole\u201d needing to be closed. The United Nations protocol on refugees, to which the US was already a signatory, was incorporated into American law by the US Refugee Act of 1980. Republican allies of Trump in Congress have proposed an overhaul of immigration law that would force migrants to claim asylum from their own country or Mexico, a plan widely derided by human rights groups and immigrant activists. Horrifying stories have meanwhile emerged from camps near the border packed with migrants, including young children. A Trump administration lawyer argued in court last week that detained children did not require soap or toothbrushes to be held in \u201csafe and sanitary\u201d conditions, and could be made to sleep on cold concrete floors. Asked about the conditions facing migrant children, during an interview with NBC\u2019s Meet the Press that was broadcast on Sunday, Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019re doing a fantastic job under the circumstances.\u201d That claim was echoed by Vice-President Mike Pence, in interviews with CNN and CBS. The debate over how to deal with an influx of largely Hispanic migrants has unfolded against a backdrop of racial panic among some devotees of Trump, whose \u201cbase\u201d of support skews towards older white Americans in rural areas. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, a Republican, came under fire for posting a tweet on Saturday linking to a news article on how his state \u201cgained almost nine Hispanic residents for every additional white resident last year\u201d. Activists and community leaders said over the weekend Trump\u2019s delay of the Ice raids put them in an all-too-familiar position. \u201cHe\u2019s done this before,\u201d Father Richard Smith, a San Francisco clergy leader and immigration activist, told the Guardian. \u201cPart of his strategy clearly is to incite fear among a vulnerable community that is already in fear. It\u2019s death by a thousand cuts.\u201d",

Unlike most coountries, they requested the workd refer to their country always with the French name. It was in October 1985 that the government requested that the country be known as C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire in every language, without the hyphen, contravening the standard rule in French that geographical names with several words must be written with hyphens. Paul Hewn, Harrogate England.</p> <p>Incidentally it\u2019s illegal to call the Ivory Coast, the Ivory Coast, in the Ivory Coast i.e. it must be called Cote d\u2019Ivoire. Paul Salmon, Edinburgh Scotland</p> <p>Teams are known by the name they are registered under Fifa regulations. The Ivory Coast, being French speaking, are registered under their native tongue \u2018Cote D\u2019Ivoire\u2019 and that is how they are referred to. Peter, Skegness, UK</p> <p>Two questions, two answers: the specific case of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire (don\u2019t forget the circumflex..), like that of Kyiv (Ukraine) and Belarus, is a side-effect of the current status of English as the lingua of international diplomacy/business/everything else - they are political choices made at the request of governments of countries seeking to establish their identities by adopting the local language versions of names rather than the calques and forms from \u201coppressor\u201d languages that were commonly used previously. Similar patterns can be seen in Flanders, where it is becoming more common in English to use the Dutch forms of names of middle-sized towns like Leuven, Mechelen and Kortrijk than the French Louvain, Malines and Courtrai which were more likely to be used fifty years ago. As for the general question, why do we pronounce the S on the end of Paris and call Shqiperi \u201cAlbania\u201d and so on: because English names were adopted at times when the native pronunciations differed, or when places were dominated by or known through a different culture, and have fossilised while the native usages have shifted; at the same time there will also have been changes to accommodate those tricky unfamiliar sounds that foreigners like to make that can\u2019t be replicated by honest Englishmen. Places which were important to the English a few centuries ago - trading ports, for example - are most likely to have names that differ markedly from their modern local forms; places which have only become familiar recently will probably not. It is not a permanent phenomenon, as places which have a lower profile will tend to lose their old English names in favour of the current native ones: few people call Livorno \u201cLeghorn\u201d any more.

      "bodyText": "So, that\u2019s about us - thanks for your company. Ta-ra. As for Namibia, they gave it a really good go, organised at the back and eager to get down the other end where possible. If they can find a similar level in their next two games, they can give similar aggravation to South Africa and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. So there we go: Morocco get a win they could scarcely do without, and won\u2019t exactly care how it came about. But if they\u2019re not concerned about how they played, given we\u2019ve seen it before, then they should be. They\u2019re too slow, too predictable and too cautious, nowhere good enough considering the players that they have. It\u2019s hit him. Poor Keymuine is suddenly desperate and distraught, cuddled and carried off the pitch by his manager. Oh, mate. Life, oh life, oh life, oh ho life, doo, doot doot dooo. 90+3 min It never rains. Keymuine, who\u2019s running a temper fouls Boufal and is booked. 90+2 min That goal really was a shot of pure, uncut football, a battling performance ruined by two moments of cruel, unnecessary silliness, giving victory to the favourites. 90 min There\u2019ll be three added minutes. Aaaarrrggghhh! Ziyech whips in a decent ball which Keymuine expects Horaeb to clear; he does not, and with Saiss behind him, Keymine can\u2019t decide whether to go at it with head or foot, crouching into an awkward right-angle before placing a firm volley into the far corner. 89 min Keymuine fells Boussoufa, giving Ziyech another free-kick to waste, 25 yards out and well left of centre. 87 min What\u2019s noticeable about Morocco is their apparent unwillingness to beat men. Boufal is the only one so inclined, and he\u2019s made a difference, this time dashing to the line and running out of pitch before he can cross. 86 min Benatia should be driving his team forward here, charging out with the ball and threatening all sorts to those playing too slowly. 84 min Sunglasses indoors, who could possibly have guessed. 83 min I\u2019ve not seem loads of them, but Morocco seem to struggle working up a head of steam. They need to ringfence the Namibia box so that when a ball\u2019s cleared they\u2019re in position to stick it straight back in if they want to, but instead go through another succession of passes, often from back to front. 81 min Kazapua is down with some kind of discomfort. In unconnected news, his team are heading for a point against a more fancied side with nine minutes to go. 79 min I\u2019ve no idea why Boufal didn\u2019t start, and he\u2019s been easily the most dangerous attacker on the pitch, now playing a one-two with Hakimi before bending a shot just wide of the far post. 79 min Last change for Morocco, Boutaib replacing the disappointing En-Neysri. 78 min Amazing from Boufal, twizzling past 63 defenders in 0.0000045cm of space down the side of the box. But he can\u2019t quite spin into a cut-back and Kazapua clears up. 77 min Morocco should be so much better than this. 75 min Benatia intercepts a pass and rushes out with the ball, which eventually makes its way to Boufal, who takes another hopeful shot and Kazapua saves easily. 74 min Dirar takes possession 35 yards out and has Amrabat outside him, but opts to lift a hopeful one into the box for En-Neysri, allowing Haoseb to clear up. 72 min Again, Ziyech finds himself in a shooting position, beating Haoseb and shooting against Hanamub; when the ball flicks up, Kazapua has to save desperately with his foot. 71 min Lovely pass from Ziyech, straight down the side of the box for Boussoufa, who could shoot but instead looks to square for En-Neysri and Haoseb intercepts. 71 min Morocco started the second half with decent intensity, but they\u2019ve dropped off in the last few minutes. 69 min Off goes Morocco\u2019s other holding midfielder, El Ahmadi replacing Bennasser. If only the pattern of this game could\u2019ve been predicted. 67 min Morocco have been here before, and the pressure will be starting to tell. Perhaps they\u2019ll fare better against opposition looking to attack them, but will expect South Africa and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire to beat these. 65 min Haoseb turns nicely on halfway and sets Hanamub away; he crosses towards the near post, but there\u2019s no one on-hand to attack the ball. 64 min Change for Namibia: Papma replaces an knackered-looking Starke. 62 min Hanamub brushes Amrabat close to the corner flag and when the ref interprets a free-kick, becomes briefly furious; there\u2019s a hint of argy-bargy before Ziyech curls onto Haoseb\u2019s forehead. 60 min Boufal moves across the face of the box from right to left, but he\u2019s falling as he shoots. Still, though, it\u2019s a good effort considering, and Kazapua has to dive to stop. 59 min But here come Namibia, Limbondi turning beautifully and sticking in a very nice cross, towards which tanks Hotto, past Dirar. But he can\u2019t keep up with it and the chance goes. 57 min Er, now. He replaces Bourabia - quite why Renard wanted two holders in midfield, I\u2019ve no idea. 55 min It\u2019s attack against defence at the moment - in the first half, Namibia took chances to attack, but now they\u2019re getting none. I wonder when we\u2019ll see Soufiane Boufal. 54 min Morocco work the ball to Ziyech who slides in off the right and cracks a shot into the nearest available shins. 52 min Ziyech is playing narrower this half, Amrabat too, and he skates into space behind En-Neysri only to drag wide once more. 51 min Another free-kick to Morocco, down the left again, between box and touchline. Ziyech shapes to cross but Dirar is unmarked on the edge and the ball does go that way, but to Saiss pulling out of the cluster closer to goal. He can\u2019t get around it, and Namibia clear. 48 min Morocco do look to be playing faster and the lengthening shadows suggest that it\u2019s cooling down a little. That should help them, reckons our amateur meteorologist sitting in north London. 47 min More like it from Morocco, Amrabat barging through a lacklustre challenge from Horaeb and swinging in a beastly cross! En-Neysri is there! But instead of diving to head into an effectively empty net - the ball in took out Kazapua - he waits for it to arrive onto his instep, wrapped up in a bow, and party-pooping Nyambe steps in to intervene. The resultant corner comes to nothing. 46 min Off we go again! Right, the players are back... Morocco have had plenty of the ball but have barely penetrated. while Namibia have defended their box pretty well and even attacked when they can. Renard has work to do - let\u2019s see what he comes up with after the break. 45+1 min There\u2019ll be one additional minute. 45 min En-Neysri nips down the left but Nyambe gets back at him well, conceding a corner. It\u2019s half-cleared and Bourabia finds space to curl in another ball, but Haoseb is up first. 44 min Lovely feet from Shitembe, turning nicely and sending Hotto away down the right. Shalulile waits in the middle, but the cross fails to pick him out. 43 min Herv\u00e9 Renard needs to do something about this, because it\u2019s not at all good. 40 min Better from Morocco, Hakimi - who\u2019s playing well - haring past Nyambe and into the box. The angle isn\u2019t great, but the path to goal is unobstructed so he should shoot, because the cut-back isn\u2019t really on. He goes for it anyway, Hanamub is there, and Namibia clear once more. 39 min The ref is allowing a fair bit of tackling here - he could easily have handed out two cards and penalty, but erred on the side of caution and we\u2019re the better for it, I\u2019d say. 37 min Ziyech shoots low and from distance again, dragging just past the far post. If he had more support, perhaps he could pass in those positions. 35 min Dirar slides into Amrabat, who feels Haoseb\u2019s breath and arms on his neck and looks to buy a penalty, turning, moving into the box, and going down when a leg presents itself. The ref says no penalty, perhaps because Amrabat had a piece of shorts in his hand at the start of the procedure - but it was a tight one. 34 min Horaeb volleys Bourabia but incurs no penalty beyond a free-kick. 33 min Morocco look to move the ball across the pitch, seeking an opening, but Namibia shuffle across well before Ziyech, now on the right, looks to curl low towards the near post, but Kazapua is there. 31 min If Morocco are to create anything, their right-flank looks the most likely source, and again Hakimi and Ziyech combine, but again to minimal effect. 29 min Morocco look a lot like they did in Russia, short of speed and ideas. 28 min A foul from Ziyech gives Namibia a free-kick outside the box, left of centre, and the defenders come up only for Starke to curl directly at Bounou, who slices a punch clear. 26 min I\u2019ll tell you something about the Cup of Nations: the flags are absolute bangers. Kenya, Uganda, Ghana, South Africa and Sengal are stone-cold classics but I\u2019ve also got loads of time for Tanzania\u2019s break with common style, the colour-blocking deployed by Benin and Guinea-Bissau, and the simplicity and shade of green we see from Nigeria. 25 min Kazapua, in the Namibia goal, has yet to make a serious save. Morocco need to get more men into the box and, though it\u2019s hot, think about pressing Namibia\u2019s back four in possession. 23 min Nice from Ziyech, sashaying infield off the left and past Starke, opening up a shooting lane, before driving low and wide from 20 yards. 21 min It\u2019s extremely hot in Cairo, but the pitch looks in lovely nick - a huge improvement on 2017. 19 min Is Ziyech trying too much? Benatia tries an, er, diag, and he brings it down well. Outside him, Hakmi is well-placed, but Ziyech instead tries a shot though two defenders are between him and the goal, dragging wide of the far post. 17 min Benatia heads away Shitembi\u2019s cross, but the ball drops to Ketjijere, who tries a first-time lamp from 30 yards with predictable results. 16 min Still, Morocco win another free-kick down the left, this time much closer to the corner of the box. Ziyech stands behind it again, only to curl towards the keeper who collects easily. 15 min Benatia looks to spray a long pass out to Hakimi, but it looked prettier in his mind than in reality. 13 min Nyambe advances down the left and looks to swerve in a cross, but can only ram it into Bounou\u2019s midriff. 13 min I\u2019d like to see a little more movement from En-Neysri and Amrabat. 10 min Morocco win a free-kick down the left and Ziyech curls in, only to hit the man defending the front of the box. But a bungled clearance falls to Dirar, who smashes a shot from 2- yards that Kazapua tips over. The corner comes to nothing. 9 min In fairness, we\u2019ve seen him move inside a few times already, but as much to create space for Dirar more as to get on the ball. 8 min Lovely footwork from Ziyech, dematerialising two men with the twinkle of his toes, before two more arrive to crowd him out. I know he plays off the right, but I wonder whether he might best be deployed in the middle so that he\u2019s involved as often as possible. 6 min Hakimi again appears in an advanced role down the left, Amrabat\u2019s clever dummy allowing Bourabia\u2019s pass to find him. But the eventuating cross sails past the far post, and Namibia will be satsified with this start. 5 min Bourabia tanks into a slide and upends Starke, but escapes further sanction. 3 min Hakimi, of Dortmund but Real Madrid really, nashes down the left and cuts back a cross but Haoseb is there to intercept. 2 min Morocco are moving the ball pretty quickly to try and find space between and behind the two banks of. But Dirar then tries to slip in En-Neysri down the right and Nyambe scurries over to mop up. 1 min There are huge expanses of space behind either goal like at the old Wembley, and pretty wide ones down the touchlines too. Why do they do that? 1 min Morocco get us away. The players are out and huddling. Starke, along with the captain, Ketjijere, is likely to be Namibia\u2019s most significant danger. They\u2019ll have to be sharp on the counter and to have rehearsed their set-plays because it\u2019s hard to see them having much of the ball. I should note that Ryan Nyambe, Namibia\u2019s left-back, plays for Blackburn. He and Manfred Starke, of Carl Zeiss Jena, are the only players in the squad who are based in Europe; otherwise, they mainly play at home or in South Africa. Herv\u00e9 Renard is 50 years old and still capable of curtains. One can only respect that. On which point, here\u2019s a paean to the greatest hairstyle of all-time, courtesy of Joy of Six: ponytails. Youssef En-Nesyri is only 22 and scored 11 times for Leganes last season. Here\u2019s a look at his hat-trick against Betis, the first scored in La Liga by any Leganes player; if Arsenal are interested in him, as has been rumoured, you\u2019ll understand some of the why. So, what\u2019s going to happen here? If Morocco score in the first half, this could get messy, but if they don\u2019t, this could get nervy. More generally, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire look a very generous price at 10/1, but Egypt have home advantage and Mohamed Salah, while Senegal, Nigeria and Ghana have good enough players to beat any side they meet if they\u2019re on. As for Namibia, they make five changes to the team which played in their last qualifying match - a 4-1 defeat to Zambia. Out go Mbaeva, Lombard, Kambanda, Stephanus and Shilongo; in come Kazapua, Horaeb, Nyambe, Starke and Limbondo. Taking a closer look at the teams, Morocco are pretty much as expected. There was a notion that Boussoufa would play in front of the defence, but he\u2019s on the right of the three behind En-Neysri while Amrabatm who I thought might play there, is actually in the middle. Understood? For your next challenge, try reading this one without crylaughing. Because the English are far more PC and more worried about offending other countries than everyone else is. We feel we have to say C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, because that\u2019s what the Ivorians call it, but in Italy they always say \u201cCosta d\u2019Avorio\u201d, in Spain \u201cCosta de Marfil\u201d, in Slovenia \u201cSlonoko\u009a\u010dena obala\u201d. etc. In linguistics these are known as \u201cexonyms\u201d, a word in another language for a country\u2019s place-name (e.g. the French saying Edimbourg and Londres). Toby Smith, Farnborough, England Ivory Coast or C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire? Some answers from the Guardian\u2019s Noters and Queries, quite some time ago: Back to Ivory Coast, they are a special case. Unlike most coountries, they requested the workd refer to their country always with the French name. It was in October 1985 that the government requested that the country be known as C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire in every language, without the hyphen, contravening the standard rule in French that geographical names with several words must be written with hyphens. Paul Hewn, Harrogate England. Incidentally it\u2019s illegal to call the Ivory Coast, the Ivory Coast, in the Ivory Coast i.e. it must be called Cote d\u2019Ivoire. Paul Salmon, Edinburgh Scotland Teams are known by the name they are registered under Fifa regulations. The Ivory Coast, being French speaking, are registered under their native tongue \u2018Cote D\u2019Ivoire\u2019 and that is how they are referred to. Peter, Skegness, UK Two questions, two answers: the specific case of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire (don\u2019t forget the circumflex..), like that of Kyiv (Ukraine) and Belarus, is a side-effect of the current status of English as the lingua of international diplomacy/business/everything else - they are political choices made at the request of governments of countries seeking to establish their identities by adopting the local language versions of names rather than the calques and forms from \u201coppressor\u201d languages that were commonly used previously. Similar patterns can be seen in Flanders, where it is becoming more common in English to use the Dutch forms of names of middle-sized towns like Leuven, Mechelen and Kortrijk than the French Louvain, Malines and Courtrai which were more likely to be used fifty years ago. As for the general question, why do we pronounce the S on the end of Paris and call Shqiperi \u201cAlbania\u201d and so on: because English names were adopted at times when the native pronunciations differed, or when places were dominated by or known through a different culture, and have fossilised while the native usages have shifted; at the same time there will also have been changes to accommodate those tricky unfamiliar sounds that foreigners like to make that can\u2019t be replicated by honest Englishmen. Places which were important to the English a few centuries ago - trading ports, for example - are most likely to have names that differ markedly from their modern local forms; places which have only become familiar recently will probably not. It is not a permanent phenomenon, as places which have a lower profile will tend to lose their old English names in favour of the current native ones: few people call Livorno \u201cLeghorn\u201d any more. Roger Hughes, Nottingham Royaume-Uni Morocco (an unnecessarily cautious 4-2-3-1): Bounou; Hakimi, Benatia, Saiss, Dirar; Bourabia, Bennasser; Boussoufa, Amarabat, Ziyech; En-Nesyri. Namibia (a classical 4-4-2): Kazapua; Horaeb, Hanamub, Haoseb, Nyambe; Shitembi, Hotto, Starke, Ketjijere; Limbondi, Shalulie. There will, eventually, come a day when every international tournament in the world contains every international team in the world, matches played around the clock in perpetuity and streamed live onto our eyelids whether we want to watch them or not. But until that point, each tournament will boast a group of death, and at Afcon 2019, it\u2019s Group D. C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, champions in 2015, have the best individual players, and South Africa are solid, which brings us to today\u2019s teams. It\u2019s been a while since Morocco did much in the competition and they made a right and unnecessary mess at last summer\u2019s World Cup. But Herv\u00e9 Renard, their manager, has lifted this trophy twice before, and in Hakim Ziyech have a player good enough to light up the whole of Egypt. If he\u2019s on, and others help here and there, Morocco might just do something, because they their defence is up there with Africa\u2019s best. On the face of things, Namibia should present them with no problem this afternoon. They are light on names and shy of goals, qualifying with just five in eight games in the process of finishing second in a group won by Guinea-Bissau, the 118th best side in the world according to Fifa. But for many of their players, this is the opportunity of a lifetime, a factor that must not be overlooked, and anyone who sat through Morocco\u2019s match with Iran last summer will remember how lacklustre they looked when denied space in the final third. Kick-off: 3.30pm BST, 4.30pm local time.",

With his friend John Knight he also completed the 2,000 miles of the Appalachian Trail in the US in 1995, and in 2005 he walked the entire length of the 900-mile Camino de Santiago pilgrimage route across France and Spain. Fabian had many interests outside religion. He began taking part in archaeological digs in 1958 and became highly respected in the field, supervising excavations and writing reports on them. He also relished any opportunity to take in an exhibition, read a new book or enjoy a concert. His fine singing voice and talents as a cook were shared with a diverse circle of friends. He is survived by his niece, Sarah, and nephew, Mark.",

So what if they were \u201cremoaners\u201d, or Tory haters, or vacationing ministers in the Venezuelan government? Would it really have been better if they had let it be? Allowed whatever was happening to run its course, on the old, deplorable basis that it is intrinsically wrong to intervene in a \u201clovers\u2019 tiff\u201d?</p> <p>None of us yet knows precisely what took place between Johnson and Symonds. But \u2013 forgive my frustration \u2013 <em>that\u2019s the point</em>. The only defensible response of a neighbour in such circumstances was to contact the police.</p> <p>I have argued in the past that Johnson\u2019s turbulent private life is a poor basis on which to attack him. One of the great improvements in British political culture in recent decades has been the decline of moral puritanism: after the fiasco of John Major\u2019s \u201cback to basics\u201d strategy, a new and sensible consensus emerged that sexuality, infidelity and marital status are no long fair game in political conflict. But that shift does not represent a blank cheque. Yes, the police left Symonds\u2019 flat satisfied that \u201cthere were no offences or concerns apparent to officers\u201d. But the mere fact that the man poised to become prime minister in a few weeks was involved in an alarming altercation in which a neighbour felt it necessary to call police is self-evidently a legitimate matter for public inquiry.</p> <p>Broadcaster Iain Dale was quite right to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/22/boris-johnson-dodges-questions-about-row-with-partner\" title=\"\">press Johnson</a> on the matter at the Conservative leadership hustings in Birmingham on Saturday. Others should now do the same. We have absolutely no right to know more about, say, the petty private details of Johnson\u2019s prospective divorce from his second wife, or the state of his relationships with his children. We have every right to ask why his partner was screaming on Thursday night and telling him to \u201cget off\u201d her. The line between private and public was clearly breached, and it is time that some of Johnson\u2019s more fanatical supporters acknowledged this basic moral distinction.</p> <p>And there is another, more nuanced dimension to this grisly episode. The person who, so to speak, led us to the door of Symonds\u2019 flat in Camberwell is none other than Johnson himself. His repeated insistence in Birmingham that people didn\u2019t \u201cwant to hear about that kind of thing\u201d rang hollow precisely because \u2013 more than any other contemporary British politician \u2013 he has tried to turn public life into a game of personality, in which wit, confidence, charm and personal presence eclipse policy and substance. This is the proposition upon which his bid for the top job is based: that character is all. It is hardly surprising, then, that his character is now being examined as never before.</p> <p>One should perhaps more accurately say \u201ccharacter\u201d. For the personality that Johnson has presented to the world is a confection, a stage act with roots in his true nature but with many affectations and contrivances. He is, one should never forget, \u201cAl\u201d (for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-15401564/this-week-quiz-what-is-boris-johnson-s-full-name\" title=\"\">Alexander</a>) to his loved ones. \u201cBoris\u201d is a persona: it is his populist Conservative version of Ziggy Stardust, The Rock or Borat. It is a means to an end \u2013 and a potent one.</p> <p>Over the years, the character of \u201cBoris\u201d has proved to be a vehicle for some pretty horrible rhetoric: most recently, his declaration that a Muslim woman wearing the niqab resembled \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/20/boris-johnson-cleared-over-burqa-comments\" title=\"\">a bank robber</a>\u201d and that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/06/boris-johnsons-burqa-remarks-fan-flames-of-islamophobia-says-mp\" title=\"\">it was</a> \u201cabsolutely ridiculous that people should choose to go around looking like letterboxes\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Let\u2019s begin with the straightforward part: any incident in which a woman is heard screaming in her home, and shouting \u201cGet off me!\u201d at a man, instantly becomes a matter not only of public interest but public responsibility. The precise motives of the neighbours who called the police on Thursday night to report the row between Boris Johnson and his partner, Carrie Symonds \u2013 and also alerted the Guardian \u2013 should be a matter of near total indifference. So what if they were \u201cremoaners\u201d, or Tory haters, or vacationing ministers in the Venezuelan government? Would it really have been better if they had let it be? Allowed whatever was happening to run its course, on the old, deplorable basis that it is intrinsically wrong to intervene in a \u201clovers\u2019 tiff\u201d? None of us yet knows precisely what took place between Johnson and Symonds. But \u2013 forgive my frustration \u2013 that\u2019s the point. The only defensible response of a neighbour in such circumstances was to contact the police. I have argued in the past that Johnson\u2019s turbulent private life is a poor basis on which to attack him. One of the great improvements in British political culture in recent decades has been the decline of moral puritanism: after the fiasco of John Major\u2019s \u201cback to basics\u201d strategy, a new and sensible consensus emerged that sexuality, infidelity and marital status are no long fair game in political conflict. But that shift does not represent a blank cheque. Yes, the police left Symonds\u2019 flat satisfied that \u201cthere were no offences or concerns apparent to officers\u201d. But the mere fact that the man poised to become prime minister in a few weeks was involved in an alarming altercation in which a neighbour felt it necessary to call police is self-evidently a legitimate matter for public inquiry. Broadcaster Iain Dale was quite right to press Johnson on the matter at the Conservative leadership hustings in Birmingham on Saturday. Others should now do the same. We have absolutely no right to know more about, say, the petty private details of Johnson\u2019s prospective divorce from his second wife, or the state of his relationships with his children. We have every right to ask why his partner was screaming on Thursday night and telling him to \u201cget off\u201d her. The line between private and public was clearly breached, and it is time that some of Johnson\u2019s more fanatical supporters acknowledged this basic moral distinction. And there is another, more nuanced dimension to this grisly episode. The person who, so to speak, led us to the door of Symonds\u2019 flat in Camberwell is none other than Johnson himself. His repeated insistence in Birmingham that people didn\u2019t \u201cwant to hear about that kind of thing\u201d rang hollow precisely because \u2013 more than any other contemporary British politician \u2013 he has tried to turn public life into a game of personality, in which wit, confidence, charm and personal presence eclipse policy and substance. This is the proposition upon which his bid for the top job is based: that character is all. It is hardly surprising, then, that his character is now being examined as never before. One should perhaps more accurately say \u201ccharacter\u201d. For the personality that Johnson has presented to the world is a confection, a stage act with roots in his true nature but with many affectations and contrivances. He is, one should never forget, \u201cAl\u201d (for Alexander) to his loved ones. \u201cBoris\u201d is a persona: it is his populist Conservative version of Ziggy Stardust, The Rock or Borat. It is a means to an end \u2013 and a potent one. Over the years, the character of \u201cBoris\u201d has proved to be a vehicle for some pretty horrible rhetoric: most recently, his declaration that a Muslim woman wearing the niqab resembled \u201ca bank robber\u201d and that it was \u201cabsolutely ridiculous that people should choose to go around looking like letterboxes\u201d. He has called homosexual men \u201cbum boys\u201d. He has \u2013 unbelievably \u2013 written about \u201cpiccaninnies\u201d with \u201cwatermelon smiles\u201d. His trick seems to be to scuttle behind the increasingly tattered defence that he is only trying to be funny, that his remarks have been taken \u201cout of context\u201d, that he is the victim of our old friend, political correctness gone mad. To his liberal audience, he says: lighten up. To his hardcore rightwing fans, he winks like Donald Trump, as if to say: I\u2019m on your side, just so you know.

Or nasty Mr Hyde: the burqa-bashing populist who has led the charge for Brexit, says \u201cfuck business\u201d (and, presumably, the jobs that go with it) and treated the case of an imprisoned British-Iranian woman with indefensible sloppiness? I find this parlour game \u2013 this reduction of British politics to a low-rent Churchillian soap opera \u2013 unforgivable.

Although the move of big tech firms such as Facebook, Amazon and Alibaba into financial services could speed up transactions and cut costs, especially in developing world countries, it could also undermine the stability of a banking system that has only just recovered from the crash of 2008. Echoing warnings from many tech experts, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) said that while there were potential benefits to be made, the adoption of digital currencies outside the current financial system could reduce competition and create data privacy issues. \u201cThe aim should be to respond to big techs\u2019 entry into financial services so as to benefit from the gains while limiting the risks,\u201d said Hyun Song Shin, economic adviser and head of research at BIS. \u201cPublic policy needs to build on a more comprehensive approach that draws on financial regulation, competition policy and data privacy regulation.\u201d The warning from the BIS on Sunday comes only days after Facebook announced it would launch its own digital currency, Libra, in 2020. It will allow its billions of users to make financial transactions across the globe in a move that could potentially shake up the world\u2019s banking system. Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook, last week added his voice to concerns being expressed over big tech\u2019s move into finance, warning that Libra could shift power into the wrong hands. Hughes, who is co-chair of the Economic Security Project, an anti-poverty campaign group, said: \u201cIf even modestly successful, Libra would hand over much of the control of monetary policy from central banks to these private companies. If global regulators don\u2019t act now, it could very soon be too late.\u201d Shin said policymakers needed to consider whether the current system, which allows banks to charge more and build up reserves to protect themselves in times of crisis, was preferable to a more competitive system where transaction costs were lower but the resilience of the financial system was less well known. The lure of greater competition between rival digital currencies could prove illusory if a project like Facebook\u2019s Libra became dominant across the world. He said policymakers also needed to coordinate their efforts to make sure the new systems were regulated to protect customers and prevent them facilitating money laundering. Striking a more positive note, the Bank of England last week cautiously welcomed the advent of digital currencies, saying it would not develop its own but rely on tight regulation of private sector initiatives.

Tower Hamlets social services, the London council which has responsibility for the baby\u2019s welfare, asked a high court judge to intervene in the case after the man and his partner, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, failed to register the child\u2019s birth earlier this year. Mr Justice Hayden ruled the council had the right to step in as the child\u2019s \u201cinstitutional parent\u201d to register the birth. The judge considered the issue at a private hearing earlier this month in the family division of the high court in London and outlined his decision in a written ruling published online. The child, referred to in the case only as T, is currently the subject of a care order while his parents are \u201csubject to a residential assessment\u201d. The judge was told that the couple\u2019s parenting skills were being assessed before decisions about the boy\u2019s long-term future were made. He also noted that the father\u2019s behaviour towards a judge in the family court resulted in a prison sentence for him and his partner.

He argued that registering the birth would make the child \u201can asset to the country, which has boarded a vessel to sail on the high seas\u201d. The judge added the essence of the father\u2019s objection was \u201chis belief that registration will cause his son to become controlled by a state which he perceives to be authoritarian and capricious\u201d. Hayden pointed out that the 1953 Births and Deaths Registration Act required a birth to be registered within 42 days of a child being born. He ruled: \u201cIt is manifestly in T\u2019s best interest for his birth to be registered, in order that he may be recognised as a citizen and entitled to the benefits of such citizenship.\u201d",

For his first menswear show since his appointment as creative director of the house in January, the French designer mentally took the audience out of sweltering Paris and brought them to the cool breeze of the seaside. In real life, he invited them to a swimming pool in the 19th arrondissement and provided peach ice teas to set the scene.</p> \n<p>\u201cI love my job,\u201d he said backstage after the show, \u201cbut the holidays is always the best part of our lives and I wanted to express something very bright and playful and [capture] this idea of travelling.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/feb/27/lanvins-new-designer-reinvents-houses-original-style-bruno-sialelli-paris-fashion-week\">Lanvin's new designer reinvents house's original style</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>His newly adopted home has been on a journey of its own of late. In the past four years, a series of short-lived creative-director appointments under old management threw the brand into financial and creative chaos. It was a far cry from the headlining company it was under the former creative director, Alber Elbaz, who steered it to 14 years of sustained success before his acrimonious departure in 2015. In 2018, long-term menswear creative director Lucas Ossendrijver left after 14 years, too. As a result, Sialelli \u2013 who has worked in the design teams at Balenciaga, Acne, and most recently, Loewe \u2013 is the guy everyone is pinning their hopes on to reinvigorate its trajectory.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7049ddbd9ca9500c34b145b857e51b2977e84d44\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7049ddbd9ca9500c34b145b857e51b2977e84d44/0_352_5342_3206/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Life\u2019s a beach at Lanvin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Life\u2019s a beach at Lanvin.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Swan Gallet/WWD/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In January, CEO Jean-Philippe Hecquet revealed that Sialelli had been tasked with \u201cbringing back to life this beautiful and unique fashion house, and once again inspire a passion among our customers,\u201d and the 31-year-old designer heard him loud and clear.</p> \n<p>As with his womenswear collection in January, the new menswear range looked <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2015/mar/05/jeanne-lanvin-palais-galliera-paris-exhibition-in-pictures\">to the life and travels of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2015/mar/05/jeanne-lanvin-palais-galliera-paris-exhibition-in-pictures\">house</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2015/mar/05/jeanne-lanvin-palais-galliera-paris-exhibition-in-pictures\"> founder Jeanne Lanvin for inspiration</a>.

      "bodyText": "Bruno Sialelli may be hard at work as the new boy at Lanvin but he has holidays on the mind. For his first menswear show since his appointment as creative director of the house in January, the French designer mentally took the audience out of sweltering Paris and brought them to the cool breeze of the seaside. In real life, he invited them to a swimming pool in the 19th arrondissement and provided peach ice teas to set the scene. \u201cI love my job,\u201d he said backstage after the show, \u201cbut the holidays is always the best part of our lives and I wanted to express something very bright and playful and [capture] this idea of travelling.\u201d His newly adopted home has been on a journey of its own of late. In the past four years, a series of short-lived creative-director appointments under old management threw the brand into financial and creative chaos. It was a far cry from the headlining company it was under the former creative director, Alber Elbaz, who steered it to 14 years of sustained success before his acrimonious departure in 2015. In 2018, long-term menswear creative director Lucas Ossendrijver left after 14 years, too. As a result, Sialelli \u2013 who has worked in the design teams at Balenciaga, Acne, and most recently, Loewe \u2013 is the guy everyone is pinning their hopes on to reinvigorate its trajectory. In January, CEO Jean-Philippe Hecquet revealed that Sialelli had been tasked with \u201cbringing back to life this beautiful and unique fashion house, and once again inspire a passion among our customers,\u201d and the 31-year-old designer heard him loud and clear. As with his womenswear collection in January, the new menswear range looked to the life and travels of house founder Jeanne Lanvin for inspiration. This manifested in a mash-up of fabrications, including intarsia knitwear \u2013 like tapestries depicting seascapes she would have picked up and brought home \u2013 and beaded embellishment, such as trinkets she might have found in a bazaar. The theme of holiday paved way for nautical stripes \u2013 in knitwear and seersucker suiting \u2013 and sailor collars. Straw holiday hats (the dodgy kind) had hand embroidered Lanvin motifs; and bags were the colour of an orange buoy. Mermaid (taken from Lanvin\u2019s antique taps), shell and starfish prints made repeat appearances, while a series of reinterpreted beer-mat prints ticked the ironic box that\u2019s proven an undeterrable trend of late. There\u2019s a new mood to the house that reflects both Sialelli\u2019s youth and experience. His former employer, Loewe, is a venerable lifestyle brand as much as it is a fashion house, with its artistic collaborations and references central to its appeal. For this show, Sialelli channelled the same stimuli, not least with the invitation which was a limited-edition print by the artist and rising star Luke Edward Hall featuring four men in Lanvin-blue swim trunks. Sialelli, however, is targeting a younger audience than his last house; as a concept, this was more first freedom than established culture vulture. He said backstage that he wanted to \u201cexpress something easy and cool and French\u201d with his team who \u201care excited about working with new languages\u201d and, with this, he is heading in the right direction.",

The retired caretaker, who lived in Grantham in Lincolnshire, was 66 when he died. A catalogue of blunders meant that he was never offered the radiotherapy.</p> <p>Bevan\u2019s condition was first diagnosed in October 2016 by a lung cancer multi-disciplinary team (MDT) from the United Lincolnshire trust after he had a positron emission tomography (PET) scan at Pilgrim hospital in Boston, Lincolnshire, where he was already being treated for an abdominal aortic aneurysm.</p> <p>However, neither doctors from there nor from the University Hospitals Leicester trust, to where his care was transferred, told him he had lung cancer until January last year \u2013 15 months later \u2013 by which time the NHS could no longer save his life. It emerged at the inquest into his death that medical staff at both trusts had a series of opportunities to break the news to him during those 15 months, when he attended appointments for the aneurysm, but did not do so.</p> <p>\u201cI feel that my dad was totally let down by the NHS, whose founder was Nye Bevan who, as the name suggests, my dad was related to \u2013 it was his great uncle.

      "bodyText": "A relative of Nye Bevan, the founder of the NHS, died after serious mistakes by two hospital trusts meant his lung cancer went from treatable to incurable, the Guardian can reveal. Roderick Bevan would have survived but for the failure of two sets of doctors to tell him for more than a year that he had the disease, blunders that amounted to \u201cneglect\u201d, a coroner has ruled. The deceased was a great-nephew of the health minister in the postwar Labour government who is widely revered for his role in driving through the creation of the health service in 1948. Roderick Bevan died in May 2018 after NHS doctors diagnosed his lung cancer after a scan but did not ensure that he then underwent stereotactic ablative radiotherapy \u2013 treatment that if he had had it at the time was expected to cure him. The retired caretaker, who lived in Grantham in Lincolnshire, was 66 when he died. A catalogue of blunders meant that he was never offered the radiotherapy. Bevan\u2019s condition was first diagnosed in October 2016 by a lung cancer multi-disciplinary team (MDT) from the United Lincolnshire trust after he had a positron emission tomography (PET) scan at Pilgrim hospital in Boston, Lincolnshire, where he was already being treated for an abdominal aortic aneurysm. However, neither doctors from there nor from the University Hospitals Leicester trust, to where his care was transferred, told him he had lung cancer until January last year \u2013 15 months later \u2013 by which time the NHS could no longer save his life. It emerged at the inquest into his death that medical staff at both trusts had a series of opportunities to break the news to him during those 15 months, when he attended appointments for the aneurysm, but did not do so. \u201cI feel that my dad was totally let down by the NHS, whose founder was Nye Bevan who, as the name suggests, my dad was related to \u2013 it was his great uncle. I am sure that he would be appalled by the events that have unfolded,\u201d said Roderick Bevan\u2019s daughter, Paula. At the end of the two-day inquest into the events surrounding his death that opened at Boston coroner\u2019s court on 30 April and ended on 1 May, the coroner, Paul Smith, ruled that Roderick Bevan\u2019s death was the result of \u201cnatural causes contributed to by neglect\u201d. In his verdict, the coroner said: \u201cOn the balance of probabilities, had the results of the PET scan and/or the recommendation of the multi-disciplinary team meeting of 11 October 2016 been acted upon promptly, the treatment proposed for Mr Bevan would have been successful.\u201d In the days before he died, Bevan asked his daughter to request an inquest into the care and treatment he received so that the mistakes in his case became known to the public in order to avoid others suffering as a result of the same errors. Peter Walsh, the chief executive of Action against Medical Accidents, a charity that campaigns against medical negligence, said: \u201cThis is a shocking case of multiple failures by the NHS which appear to have taken away Mr Bevan\u2019s chances of a cure. \u201cIt is highly ironic that this should happen to a relative of Nye Bevan\u2019s.

Rather it is yet another example of how the modern-day NHS is failing far too many patients. \u201cNye Bevan would turn in his grave if he knew the number of avoidable deaths and other serious harm being caused by failure in patient safety.\u201d Christine Bowerman of JMP Solicitors, which represented Bevan\u2019s family at the inquest, said Bevan had died avoidably and prematurely as a direct result of \u201cgross medical failings\u201d and \u201cnumerous systematic errors\u201d by the two trusts. \u201cThis case was truly appalling, the fact that multiple individuals within two NHS trusts didn\u2019t communicate to a patient in their care that he had a treatable lung cancer for 15 months is despicable\u201d, said Bowerman, a specialist in medical negligence.

The name Paul Ricard conjures two things. The first is the <a href=\"https://www.depop.com/products/urrealvintage-ricard-french-vintage/\">yellow branded ashtray</a> that many a Brit abroad filched in the 1970s: Ricard himself was the industrialist who brought mass-produced <em>pastis</em> to the market. You know, that aniseed drink that the French drink at odd times of the day. Also, that the circuit was used on the ZX Spectrum game <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAjLL53g2U8\">Chequered Flag</a>. It had a hugely satisfying straight in which you could put your joystick into full throttle...<br><br>Ah, memories. The old circuit is in its second year back on the F1 schedule, and that famous straight, the Mistral, is where Lewis Hamilton will look to put even further distance between himself and his rivals. Teammate Valtteri Bottas is 29 points back, and Sebastian Vettel, who lost his appeal against his penalty at the Canadian GP, fully 62 points back on 100 points. Hamilton can claim a sixth win of the season if he wins today, and that has to be on the cards. Bottas is second on the grid, with Charles Leclerc in third. Poor old Seb is back in seventh. <br><br>All a bit too predictable? Then there is fun to be had in Formula 2. Get this man a ride in F1. <br><br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Indian Formula Two driver Mahaveer Raghunathan has been banned for a race after collecting nine penalty points in a single afternoon at the French Grand Prix. </p> \n   <p>The 20-year-old, who competes under a Dutch licence, infringed three virtual safety car procedures in Saturday\u2019s race at le Castellet and was handed three points for each infringement. </p> \n   <p>Added to the points he already had, Raghunathan reached the 12 point limit that triggers an automatic ban, meaning the Chennai-born driver will miss next weekend\u2019s round in Austria. </p> \n   <p>The MP Motorsport driver has yet to score a point this season.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s Giles Richards\u2019 report from Paul Ricard. Here\u2019s the confirmed final standings, barring legal challenge... Lando Norris succinctly sums up how his race ended. The three on the podium speak before they have a rather stilted encounter with Jackie Stewart on the way to receiving trophies and spraying champagne. Hamilton: \u201cIt was a very good weekend. I have been racing a long time and this never gets old. I just try to find the edge and I couldn\u2019t do without this incredible team and all the guys back at the factory. I am hyped, it\u2019s a beautiful day in the South of France but it is sweaty. It is very bumpy and actually an awesome track to drive. It wasn\u2019t easy at all. There\u2019s always things happening\u2026this has been the best start ever to the year.\u201d Bottas: \u201cHe is not unbeatable. I will have to work hard to beat him.\u201d Leclerc: \u201cI have tried everything. In the last two laps, I was getting quite close. I believed in him until the last minute.\u201d Celebrating the extension of his championship lead to 36 points, his sixth win of the season and his fourth in succession, Hamilton hugs his teammates, giving props to the engineers and staff in the interview that immediately follows victory. A jubilant Hamilton thanks his team for an \u201can awesome weekend\u201d and all his complaints of the afternoon are forgotten. Norris, meanwhile, looks to have been overtaken by unfair means, with Ricciardo cutting across him and that will be under investigation. He lost three places as a result of that. Will these standings, er, stand? Lap 53/53: Hamilton rolling home to reach the finish, while Charles Leclerc is right on the tail of Bottas, and is within 0.7 seconds of the second placed car. He makes a last-ditch attempt to get there but falls short. Oh no! Ricciardo has overtaken Norris, as have Raikkonen and Hulkenberg...Norris drops down to tenth. Can Vettel claim the fastest lap?...Yes, he can. Lap 52/53: Vettel does go into the pits after all in his search for the fastest lap. Norris, who has been lapped by Hamilton, is battling desperately to hold Ricciardo. Really great driving from the teenager. Lap 51/53: Verstappen says his tyres are \u201cpretty f***ked\u201d and it seems that Vettel will look to chase down his rival for fourth rather than go into the pit to get fast tyres on. Lap 50/53: Hamilton has helped Norris\u2019 cause a little, stopping his chasers being able to hunt down their prey. There is a loose bollard on the track and now there is a virtual safety car as a steward makes a brave burst to rescue it. Lap 48/53: Hulkenberg and Raikkonen is the battle for ninth and tenth. Ricciardo is in eighth, and has been lapped by Hamilton as soon will be Norris. The Mercedes team tell him not to be too daft near Norris as bits may be dropping off the McLaren. Lap 47/53: Romain Grosjean has to retire in his Haas car. Up ahead, Lando Norris is having untold trouble, telling the radio that his car is now heavy. Must be like driving a B-Reg VW Polo with five passengers and no power steering up a farm track. And the man on the line says it is only going to get worse. Lap 46/53: Kyvat and Albon, teammates for Toro Rosso, are going at it with each other down that Mistral straight, that from Chequered Flag. That\u2019s a battle for 15th and 16th, and that\u2019s where the thrills are coming in this race. Albon is holding off his team-mates. Lap 45/53: Fastest lap now with Bottas as Hamilton is told not to risk all to try and win it back. Vettel is soon to come in for an extra pit lane to be put on the fastest tyres possible to claim that vital point. Lap 44/53: Norris is having to hold off Ricciardo, Raikkonen and Hulkenberg, who are in eighth, ninth and tenth. The gap to Ricciardo is dropping fast. Lap 43/53: Another fastest lap by Hamilton, who is totally cruising to victory, a sixth of the season. This is an awesome display of Mercedes strength. Lando Norris is warned that his hydraulics are jiggered as he tells his team he is having problems. They tell him to do as best as he can. Lap 42/53: Leclerc has set a fastest lap, which would give him an extra point if he hold on to that, or extends it...but no, Hamilton claims it back, after being warned by his team of his ailing tyres. He says he is OK with them. Lap 40/53: Lando Norris is told he is not allowed to use DRS to overtake Sainz up ahead of him. The McLarens go past Lance Stroll of Racing Point and up to sixth and seventh as Stroll drops to 13th after a long wait for a pit. Lap 39/53: Bottas is told by his team that he has blistering on his tyres, but that he has nothing to worry about. Lap 38/53: Discussion among the McLaren cars, and the drivers are being asked to pick up the pace. Lando Norris acts a bit teenage when asked to do so, indicating that Carlos Sainz ahead of him is not exactly giving it full gas. Lap 37/53: Let\u2019s be fair here, this has not been a classic, after Canada being so full of intrigue and a near-classic at Monaco. A rain shower is required to liven things up, perhaps a shower of pastis to sticky up the track. Meanwhile, Grosjean\u2019s attempt to tell tales on Ricciardo has come to nowt. The stewards will not be doing anything about that flashpoint. Lap 36/53: Hulkenberg went into the pits, but ended up dropping down to 11th, having been in seventh. He was not helped by a rather slow pit stop. This spoke too soon. Lap 35/53: Lewis Hamilton complains that the tyres he is on now are not as good as those he started on as he heads for his sixth win of the season. You have to be suffer to beautiful, as they say. Lap 33/53: Ricciardo up to 10th as he overtakes Kyvat, and goes into the points. It\u2019s been a hard day in the Renault for him. Lap 32/53: Hamilton sets the fastest lap again, and despite his seating problems this has been an armchair ride for him. Lap 31/53: The stewards are having a look at that Grosjean/Ricciardo tete a tete, but it seems unlikely that they will act. Ricciardo has problems, and one of them is that his drinking straw is not working. He will be absolutely parched at the end of this race. Lap 29/53: Bottas fights back and sets a fastest lap. Back in the field, Grosjean and Ricciardo have had a spat, with the Frenchman making a complaint about the way the Aussie overtook him. Lap 28/53: Bottas under a bit of pressure, though, as Leclerc begins to make inroads. There\u2019s 3.66 seconds between them where the gap to Hamilton is a mighty 11.8 seconds. Lap 26/53: Vettel, at last, comes in, and having failed to land a blow on the leaders, is now in fifth, behind Verstappen, who made his stop in the 20th lap. Let\u2019s see if that can be the battle to provide entertainment. The race at the front is turning into a procession. Lap 24/53: In goes Bottas, who then concedes a place to Vettel, but stays ahead of Leclerc. Hamilton continues to be the quickest on his tyres but here comes the change, which takes just 2.2 seconds, and he comes out of the pit lane and still ahead of Vettel and Bottas. If this is a one-stop strategy, then the race is his, barring someone letting Mahaveer Raghunathan loose in the second half of the race. Lap 23/53: Verstappen has whinge to his team that his throttle isn\u2019t working properly. We all know how that feels. Hamilton meanwhile is on the radio and proclaiming that his tyres are fine. Lap 22/53: Leclerc has gone into the pits and comes out in fourth, thus swapping placed with Vettel, who is still to pit. The leaders, Mercedes, yet to get the mechanics on the go just yet. Lap 21/53: Vettel up to fourth as Verstappen pits, and so that\u2019s Mercedes in first and second and then Ferrari in third and fourth. Hamilton has blazed away and has six seconds, just about on Bottas. Lap 20/53: Perez takes his medicine and takes a pit that is extended to almost ten seconds. Sainz goes into the pits to follow on from Norris, his McLaren teammate, and he is now back in 10th. Lap 19/53: Ricciardo overtakes Gasly using DRS to move up to 15th. Lando Norris comes in for a change, and has dropped into 12th, ahead of Romain Grosjean. Lap 17/53: Ricciardo comes in, and that takes quite a while as he changes his tyres to what presumably is a harder compound. He is down to 16th now, though plenty of others have to come in, too. Lap 16/53: Very few people have pitted so far, despite many of the teams beginning the race on soft tyres. Hamilton is now 3.7 seconds ahead of Bottas, who has almost six seconds on Leclerc. Vettel is closing on Verstappen and that looks like being the battle of the day. Lap 15/53: Hamilton is now complaining about his seat, which he says is broken. That could be uncomfortable for the rest of the race. Despite a sore rear end and potential back ache, he is still the fastest man out there. Lap 13/53: Someone had to do this gag...Vettel claimed the fastest lap, only for Hamilton to take it off him. Lap 12/53: Hamilton has set the fastest lap again. Racing Point, Sergio Perez\u2019s team, are not happy about that five-second penalty, saying he was forced off at the start. Shades of l\u2019affair Vettel? Lap 10/53: Bottas is almost 3.9 seconds clear of Leclerc and Mercedes, barring problems with those engine settings, look to have this one licked. It has been confirmed Perez has indeed received a five-second penalty. Lap 8/53: Vettel burns past Sainz, and is in fifth. He\u2019s motoring along, and now closing on Verstappen. Sergio Perez is going to be penalised for taking a shortcut at the start, having channelled his inner Mahaveer Raghunathan. Lap 6/53: Hamilton is opening up a gap of 2.1 seconds, and is setting fastest laps. Ominous for the others. He has a rather terse conversation with his man on the radio. \u201cMake your decision and stick to it,\u201d he says. Anyone get the impression he isn\u2019t easy to deal with. There does seem to be a problem with his engine settings. Lap 5/53: Verstappen is now happy with his engine again, so will not need to go in after all. Vettel moves into sixth, having overtaken Lando Norris, so that\u2019s a better sign for Ferrari\u2019s leading man. Lap 3/53: Hamilton has 1.5 seconds on Bottas. Verstappen is telling his garage that his engine is not performing as expected. Looks like he may need to call in to get his battery looked at. As yet, though, Sainz is yet to trouble him. Vettel already 10 seconds back on Hamilton. Lap 2/53: Hamilton had a wobble, suggesting the track\u2019s temperature is high. Alex Albon has dropped from 11th to 16th, while Verstappen looks to have held off Sainz. The formation lap was a dance to protect tyres, and was very slow indeed. But here\u2019s the real stuff. Hamilton gets away in front, Sainz and Verstappen go wheel to wheel. One of the Force Indias goes off the track, and that looks like Sergio Perez. Sainz looking to overtake Verstappen and up his back wheel through the lap. Hamilton, Bottas and Leclerc keep the places they won on the grid. Vettel is in seventh. Ricciardo has lost a couple of places, while Norris lost a place to Sainz\u2019s excellent start off the grid. The track temperature is 57 degrees, which is hot, very hot. It\u2019s a very warm day in the south of France. And off they go on their formation lap, as Hamilton tries his best not to have to sit on the grid for too long and overheat his car. Colm Boyle has a prediction to make. \u201cI\u2019m sticking my neck out and say Norris on the podium. I know the guillotine might be the result.\u201d There\u2019s an Elton John gag here somewhere. Specks of cement dust next to Daniel Ricciardo\u2019s car, though he seems relaxed enough. \u201cI think we\u2019ll have a good race package,\u201d he says, rather corporately. Meanwhile, Seb Vettel\u2019s car needed some running repairs, and had to have spark plugs replaced. It\u2019s been a tough weekend for Ferrari. McLaren had a great day in qualifying yesterday, with two drives making the top six, with Norris in fifth and Carlos Sainz in sixth. That\u2019s the best in a long time, and a sign of progress for the team. Max Verstappen says the track \u201clooks lovely\u201d as he heads off for the nation anthem, sung by a child who doesn\u2019t have much of a future as a singer and an oddly low-volume baritone. That was parochial...now there\u2019s some acrobats. There is a village fete vibe to to the presentation here. And that\u2019s just fine. Jackie Stewart, in trademark tartan cap, is in the pit lane. \u201cMercedes still have it,\u201d says the great man. Lewis Hamilton has just scootered down to his car in the style of a hipster/Brentian sales exec. The track is showing its first sign of wear and tear after all the build-up races. \u201cWe just want to move forward, and hopefully we can move up a couple of positions,\u201d says Frenchman Pierre Gasly on his home track. Mentioning Jackie Stewart, 80 last week, here\u2019s look back at this days as a crusader for safety. Lewis Hamilton was more than satisfied after securing his third pole position of the season. Daniel Ricciardo is eighth on the grid, he spoke to Giles Richards. Here\u2019s the grid positions. Lando Norris in fifth place on the grid is a hugely impressive qualifying performance. Let\u2019s start with a diversion. The name Paul Ricard conjures two things. The first is the yellow branded ashtray that many a Brit abroad filched in the 1970s: Ricard himself was the industrialist who brought mass-produced pastis to the market. You know, that aniseed drink that the French drink at odd times of the day. Also, that the circuit was used on the ZX Spectrum game Chequered Flag. It had a hugely satisfying straight in which you could put your joystick into full throttle... Ah, memories. The old circuit is in its second year back on the F1 schedule, and that famous straight, the Mistral, is where Lewis Hamilton will look to put even further distance between himself and his rivals. Teammate Valtteri Bottas is 29 points back, and Sebastian Vettel, who lost his appeal against his penalty at the Canadian GP, fully 62 points back on 100 points. Hamilton can claim a sixth win of the season if he wins today, and that has to be on the cards. Bottas is second on the grid, with Charles Leclerc in third. Poor old Seb is back in seventh. All a bit too predictable? Then there is fun to be had in Formula 2. Get this man a ride in F1. Indian Formula Two driver Mahaveer Raghunathan has been banned for a race after collecting nine penalty points in a single afternoon at the French Grand Prix. The 20-year-old, who competes under a Dutch licence, infringed three virtual safety car procedures in Saturday\u2019s race at le Castellet and was handed three points for each infringement. Added to the points he already had, Raghunathan reached the 12 point limit that triggers an automatic ban, meaning the Chennai-born driver will miss next weekend\u2019s round in Austria. The MP Motorsport driver has yet to score a point this season. In April he was given a 10-place grid penalty after he took the chequered flag twice at the Bahrain season-opener, continuing at racing speed for an extra lap after the finish. The race goes at 2.10pm UK time.",

The trials were undertaken by Tesco along with researchers at the University of Lincoln in a mocked-up supermarket, built to test whether fridges can help to balance the energy system. Researchers found that complex algorithms, developed by the software firm IMS Evolve, can temporarily cut the electricity supply to fridges when needed while still keeping the food cold. These mini power cuts to the freezers could automatically create short pulses of extra electricity on the grid to match any dips in the grid\u2019s energy frequency. The system operator already pays firms that own utility-scale batteries to provide this service but the trial indicates that retailers can also play a role, while at the same time reducing their carbon footprints.

The UK has hundreds of thousands of energy-hungry commercial refrigeration systems, which make up about 12% of the UK\u2019s carbon emissions. For the typical retailer, energy bills can make up around a third of costs. Edward Porter, a developer at IMS Evolve, said developing software that can integrate refrigeration units into the energy system could help retailers save money while helping the UK meet its net-zero carbon target by 2050. \u201cWe\u2019re showing that technology can provide the capacity and flexibility to operate a nationwide electricity system in a far smarter way,\u201d he said. The trials by Tesco and the University of Lincoln are continuing.",

He had been either invisible or deliberately sober to the point of dullness, when his usual primary draw to Tory members is a self-created sense of optimism and fun. Much is also made of his supposed broad appeal to the electorate, evidenced by two terms as London mayor.</p>\n    <p>His bizarre claim to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/26/mesmerising-boris-johnsons-bizarre-model-buses-claim-raises-eyebrows\">make model cardboard buses</a> has raised eyebrows. In most political contests, Johnson\u2019s character \u2013 he has lost more than one job for lying, and has a complex and opaque personal life \u2013 would be a big issue, but among the Tory faithful he seemingly receives a free pass. It remains to be seen what impact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/22/neighbour-who-called-police-over-boris-johnson-row-goes-public\">late-night police visit</a> will have on his chances.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Brexit</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>He has promised to push for a new deal while insisting the UK will leave the EU come what may on 31 October, even if it involves no deal. While his hard Brexit supporters are adamant this is a cast-iron guarantee of leaving on that date, elsewhere Johnson has been somewhat less definitive. Asked about the date in a BBC TV debate, Johnson said only that it was 'eminently feasible', although he then went on to tell TalkRadio that the 31 October deadline was 'do or die'.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Taxation</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>His main pledge has been to raise the threshold for the 40% higher tax rate from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000, at a cost of almost \u00a310bn a year, which would help about 3 million higher earners, a demographic with a fairly sizeable crossover into Tory members. Johnson\u2019s camp insist it would be part of a wider \u2013 and so far unknown \u2013 package of tax changes.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Public spending</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>He has said relatively little, beyond promising a fairly small increase in schools funding, as well as talking about the need to roll out fast broadband across the country. Johnson has generally hinted he would loosen the purse strings, but given his prior fondness for big-ticket projects \u2013 London\u2019s cancelled garden bridge, the mooted 'Boris island' airport \u2013 perhaps expect more of a focus on infrastructure projects than services.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Climate and environment</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is unlikely to be a big issue for Conservative party members, and Johnson has not said much on this beyond confirming his general support for the new government target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to a net zero by 2050.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Foreign policy</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Also unlikely to be a big issue among Tory members, beyond vague platitudes on 'global Britain', it could be a weak spot for Johnson given his poor performance as foreign secretary. He was seen as something of a joke by diplomats \u2013 both UK and foreign \u2013 and is likely to face more questioning over his gaffe about the jailed British-Iranian woman&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe\">Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe</a></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterwalker\"><b>Peter Walker</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Political correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>On Sunday, Sturgeon said Johnson was seen as one of the principal people responsible for the Brexit \u201cmess\u201d by those living in Scotland, where 62% voted remain in the 2016 EU referendum.

Maligned for years as the concrete \u201cegg box\u201d of Euston Road, the <a href=\"http://britishbrutalistarchitecture.blogspot.com/2015/05/camden-town-hall-annex.html\">old council </a>headquarters have been reborn as the glamorous Standard Hotel, the first outpost of the risque boutique chain outside the US.</p> <p>\u201cPeople thought we were crazy to suggest open-air bathtubs in London,\u201d says <a href=\"https://shawnhausmandesign.com/\">Shawn Hausman</a>, the Los Angeles-based designer behind the Standard\u2019s flamboyant interiors, who started out creating film sets for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/saturday-night-fever\">Saturday Night Fever</a>. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s always nice to have a bath outside, even in the rain.\u201d</p> <p>Naked bodies bobbing above the rooftops is par for the course for a chain with a reputation for racy touches.

The price of a room is listed on the restaurant\u2019s dessert menu, and where other hotels put the Gideon Bible, here you\u2019ll find condoms and ibuprofen. </p> <p>Is this what\u2019s in store for what was, until recently, a bastion of council bureaucracy? Built in 1977 by Camden\u2019s esteemed in-house architects\u2019 department, the town hall annexe had long been seen as a concrete carbuncle. It was listed in the local conservation area plan as making a \u201cnegative contribution\u201d, its rough pre-cast facade looming across the road from George Gilbert Scott\u2019s gothic fantasy of St Pancras station like a cheese-grater.</p> <p>When Scott\u2019s creation was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/feb/13/midland-grand-hotel-st-pancras\">reborn as luxury apartments and a swanky hotel</a> in 2011, it was only a matter of time before Camden cashed in on the location and architectural heritage of its own offices. Such muscular works of brutalism were rapidly becoming the subject of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/feb/26/how-concrete-became-the-ultimate-lifestyle-concept-brutalism-architecture\">coffee-</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/feb/26/how-concrete-became-the-ultimate-lifestyle-concept-brutalism-architecture\">table books and tea towels</a> \u2013 and being eyed up by trendy hotel chains looking to make a statement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c8ed077d6a44f46451823ead40fd27accc5d5bc7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8ed077d6a44f46451823ead40fd27accc5d5bc7/0_0_2200_1467/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Recalling Paolozzi \u2026 the reception desk.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Recalling Paolozzi \u2026 the reception desk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Charles</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Facing hefty repair bills for lifts and services, the council sold the leaky hulk in 2014 for almost \u00a360m, transferring its offices to a new block just to the north, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/camdens-five-pancras-square-wins-prime-ministers-better-public-building-award-2015\">saving an estimated \u00a3500,000 a year</a>. For the Standard, which had been scouting in London for a decade, it was the perfect fit. \u201cWe thought all we needed to do was put a logo on it,\u201d says managing director Bruce Robertson.</p> <p>The reality wasn\u2019t so simple. To make the project viable, a three-storey \u201ccrown\u201d has been added, supported by threading new steel columns through the existing structure, whose facade has been scrubbed a gleaming white, while the brown-tinted windows have been replaced with clear curved glazing specially manufactured by a boatbuilding company. <a href=\"http://www.orms.co.uk/work/camden-town-hall-annexe/\">Orms</a> architects have made it look as good as new, finishing it off with a jaunty red bubble lift so guests can feel like they\u2019re being shuttled up the facade in a flying phone box.</p> <p>This flash of glossy red is a hint of what lies within. Anyone who remembers queueing up inside the council\u2019s concrete colossus to sort out their housing benefit won\u2019t recognise the place. Working with interior architects <a href=\"https://www.archerhumphryes.com/hotels/standard-hotel\">Archer Humphryes</a>, Hausman\u2019s team has conjured a surreal vision of swinging London: a souped-up Austin Powers world of enamel optical-art murals and moulded ceramic wall features, with a hoard of vintage furniture sourced from the jazziest corners of eBay.</p> <p>\u201cWe were inspired by a range of movies, from Fahrenheit 451 to Silent Running and Logan\u2019s Run,\u201d says Hausman, \u201cas well as the iconic aesthetics of the London Underground. Mid-century Italian design played a big part too.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d18a22f6a148e01dbaa47685e6f5c504c0017de8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d18a22f6a148e01dbaa47685e6f5c504c0017de8/0_440_4500_3627/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bon voyage \u2026 the ferry-style rooms.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"806\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bon voyage \u2026 the ferry-style rooms.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Charles</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A reception desk striped with exotic hardwoods stands in front of a bulging blue and red ceramic wall by <a href=\"http://lubnachowdhary.co.uk/\">Lubna Chowdhary</a>, recalling the Paolozzi mosaics at Tottenham Court Road station, while a chunky pink terrazzo floor leads visitors through to what was once St Pancras public library. It is now a lounge bar themed around an imagined 1970s library, complete with an in-house librarian who will curate a selection of \u201cradical\u201d books.</p> <p>\u201cThe original library was not so aesthetically pleasing,\u201d says Hausman, \u201cso we\u2019ve invented the kind we would have liked to find here.\u201d It is evidently the fictional library of a design aficionado: alongside retro veneered bookshelves are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jul/21/memphis-group-ettore-sottsass-design-radical-met-breuer\">collectible pieces of Memphis furniture</a>, baggy leather Saporiti sofas, and a ceiling dotted with red globe fixtures. To one side stands a \u201csounds lounge\u201d recording booth, where musicians and DJs will make podcasts and record interviews, while around the corner lies the first of several restaurants, complete with a \u201cfermentation bar\u201d.</p> <p>The interiors exude the retro charm of a Wes Anderson film set, but there is something unsavoury about a place once designed for public services being co-opted as a luxury lifestyle destination. It\u2019s like Hackney\u2019s former Asian Women\u2019s Advisory Service being crassly reborn as <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/attractions/night-out-on-mare-street-the-best-bars-restaurants-and-hangouts-in-e8-9098590.html\">The Advisory</a><a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/attractions/night-out-on-mare-street-the-best-bars-restaurants-and-hangouts-in-e8-9098590.html\"> hipster burger bar</a>. At least in this case, St Pancras library has a bright <a href=\"https://www.kingscross.co.uk/pancras-square-library\">new home in the Kings Cross development</a>, where a new public swimming pool and leisure centre have also been provided beneath the new council offices \u2013 an amenity the hotel itself lacks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"af40de7bfad04c22824122f82d57b9cc0804acae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af40de7bfad04c22824122f82d57b9cc0804acae/0_0_1500_858/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Recline and read \u2026 inside the Library Lounge, which was once a public library.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"572\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Recline and read \u2026 inside the Library Lounge, which was once a public library.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Cleveland</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Standard claims its ground floor will be as \u201cdemocratic\u201d as possible, with a dive bar-style venue spilling on to a passage, and a new public garden to the south where a closed route has been opened up. It was the only bidder for the site that proposed keeping the building \u2013 others planned to raze it in favour of a tower. When brutalist gems like the nearby Welbeck Street car park <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2019/02/11/welbeck-street-car-park-demolish-shiva-hotel/\">are being demolished</a> to make way for lumpen new hotels, the vision to reuse such a massive concrete edifice should be applauded.</p> <p>The bedrooms \u2013 which range from \u00a3150 to over \u00a31,000 per night \u2013 continue the transport theme, with the curved windows recalling those of a ferry, along with tightly pleated train-style curtains and bold geometric bedspreads by <a href=\"https://www.wallacesewell.com/project/the-standard-hotel---kings-cross\">Wallace &amp; Sewell</a> (fabric designers for Transport for London) complementing window seats in burgundy Harris tweed.

      "bodyText": "When the clerks of Camden\u2019s highways department were issuing parking fines from their gloomy office in the 1970s, little can they have imagined that jet-setting hipsters would one day be supping cocktails in the public library below them before taking an al fresco dip up on the roof. Maligned for years as the concrete \u201cegg box\u201d of Euston Road, the old council headquarters have been reborn as the glamorous Standard Hotel, the first outpost of the risque boutique chain outside the US. \u201cPeople thought we were crazy to suggest open-air bathtubs in London,\u201d says Shawn Hausman, the Los Angeles-based designer behind the Standard\u2019s flamboyant interiors, who started out creating film sets for Saturday Night Fever. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s always nice to have a bath outside, even in the rain.\u201d Naked bodies bobbing above the rooftops is par for the course for a chain with a reputation for racy touches. Its first hotel, which opened on Sunset Strip in West Hollywood in 1999, features live models in a vitrine behind the reception desk, part of an art installation called The Box. Its New York flagship, which straddles the High Line park, takes voyeurism to the next level via the celebrity-frequented Boom Boom Room, an exclusive club that boasts four sitdown toilets in a single cubicle. Then there are its full-height bedroom windows, which have given the hotel a reputation as a site of sexual exhibitionism (encouraged by raunchy scenes in Steve McQueen\u2019s film Shame being shot there). The price of a room is listed on the restaurant\u2019s dessert menu, and where other hotels put the Gideon Bible, here you\u2019ll find condoms and ibuprofen. Is this what\u2019s in store for what was, until recently, a bastion of council bureaucracy? Built in 1977 by Camden\u2019s esteemed in-house architects\u2019 department, the town hall annexe had long been seen as a concrete carbuncle. It was listed in the local conservation area plan as making a \u201cnegative contribution\u201d, its rough pre-cast facade looming across the road from George Gilbert Scott\u2019s gothic fantasy of St Pancras station like a cheese-grater. When Scott\u2019s creation was reborn as luxury apartments and a swanky hotel in 2011, it was only a matter of time before Camden cashed in on the location and architectural heritage of its own offices. Such muscular works of brutalism were rapidly becoming the subject of coffee-table books and tea towels \u2013 and being eyed up by trendy hotel chains looking to make a statement. Facing hefty repair bills for lifts and services, the council sold the leaky hulk in 2014 for almost \u00a360m, transferring its offices to a new block just to the north, saving an estimated \u00a3500,000 a year. For the Standard, which had been scouting in London for a decade, it was the perfect fit. \u201cWe thought all we needed to do was put a logo on it,\u201d says managing director Bruce Robertson. The reality wasn\u2019t so simple. To make the project viable, a three-storey \u201ccrown\u201d has been added, supported by threading new steel columns through the existing structure, whose facade has been scrubbed a gleaming white, while the brown-tinted windows have been replaced with clear curved glazing specially manufactured by a boatbuilding company. Orms architects have made it look as good as new, finishing it off with a jaunty red bubble lift so guests can feel like they\u2019re being shuttled up the facade in a flying phone box. This flash of glossy red is a hint of what lies within. Anyone who remembers queueing up inside the council\u2019s concrete colossus to sort out their housing benefit won\u2019t recognise the place. Working with interior architects Archer Humphryes, Hausman\u2019s team has conjured a surreal vision of swinging London: a souped-up Austin Powers world of enamel optical-art murals and moulded ceramic wall features, with a hoard of vintage furniture sourced from the jazziest corners of eBay. \u201cWe were inspired by a range of movies, from Fahrenheit 451 to Silent Running and Logan\u2019s Run,\u201d says Hausman, \u201cas well as the iconic aesthetics of the London Underground. Mid-century Italian design played a big part too.\u201d A reception desk striped with exotic hardwoods stands in front of a bulging blue and red ceramic wall by Lubna Chowdhary, recalling the Paolozzi mosaics at Tottenham Court Road station, while a chunky pink terrazzo floor leads visitors through to what was once St Pancras public library. It is now a lounge bar themed around an imagined 1970s library, complete with an in-house librarian who will curate a selection of \u201cradical\u201d books. \u201cThe original library was not so aesthetically pleasing,\u201d says Hausman, \u201cso we\u2019ve invented the kind we would have liked to find here.\u201d It is evidently the fictional library of a design aficionado: alongside retro veneered bookshelves are collectible pieces of Memphis furniture, baggy leather Saporiti sofas, and a ceiling dotted with red globe fixtures. To one side stands a \u201csounds lounge\u201d recording booth, where musicians and DJs will make podcasts and record interviews, while around the corner lies the first of several restaurants, complete with a \u201cfermentation bar\u201d. The interiors exude the retro charm of a Wes Anderson film set, but there is something unsavoury about a place once designed for public services being co-opted as a luxury lifestyle destination. It\u2019s like Hackney\u2019s former Asian Women\u2019s Advisory Service being crassly reborn as The Advisory hipster burger bar. At least in this case, St Pancras library has a bright new home in the Kings Cross development, where a new public swimming pool and leisure centre have also been provided beneath the new council offices \u2013 an amenity the hotel itself lacks. The Standard claims its ground floor will be as \u201cdemocratic\u201d as possible, with a dive bar-style venue spilling on to a passage, and a new public garden to the south where a closed route has been opened up. It was the only bidder for the site that proposed keeping the building \u2013 others planned to raze it in favour of a tower. When brutalist gems like the nearby Welbeck Street car park are being demolished to make way for lumpen new hotels, the vision to reuse such a massive concrete edifice should be applauded. The bedrooms \u2013 which range from \u00a3150 to over \u00a31,000 per night \u2013 continue the transport theme, with the curved windows recalling those of a ferry, along with tightly pleated train-style curtains and bold geometric bedspreads by Wallace &amp; Sewell (fabric designers for Transport for London) complementing window seats in burgundy Harris tweed. Suspended ceilings have been ripped out to reveal the concrete waffle-slabs, while the open-plan bathrooms are an on-trend Pinterest board come alive, with riotous symphonies of bubblegum pink and navy blue tiles punctuated by mint taps. Others aren\u2019t as appealing. Across the boldly-carpeted corridors \u2013 designed as \u201can archaeological dig of 1970s patterns\u201d \u2013 lie what are being marketed as \u201cCosy Core\u201d rooms, a euphemism for windowless bunkers. It is here that the challenges of converting a deep-plan office into a functioning hotel are most sorely felt \u2013 a substantial block of rooms in the centre won\u2019t enjoy a chink of daylight. \u201cIt would be illegal in the US,\u201d Hausman admits, \u201cbut here it was a great opportunity to exceed expectations of what a windowless room could be.\u201d Aimed at jet-lagged travellers and nocturnal party animals, the rooms have a loungey hungover vibe, with low corner-sofas that meld into the beds, and long wood-floored showers filled with plastic plants in the hope of distracting guests from their light-starved existence. The heady climax, which won\u2019t open until later in the year, is found at the top of the crown, where one side will be a Latin-themed restaurant run by a double-Michelin-starred chef, imagined as a 1970s tropical plant-strewn lair of macram\u00e9 curtains, rattan ceiling panels and raised terraces of crazy paving. On the other side will be an opulent 24-hour-licensed venue with faceted mirror ceilings, leather banquettes and what the designers describe as a \u201cbig, boisterous, spectacular curtain\u201d, drawn back to reveal five-metre high curved windows looking out over King\u2019s Cross \u2013 London\u2019s very own version of New York\u2019s Boom Boom Room. Longtime local residents will be astonished that such a thing could ever appear on the Euston Road, but it completes the rapid mutation of this once-seedy district into London\u2019s gilded \u201cgateway to Europe\u201d, where the likes of Google, LVMH and Universal Music rub shoulders with one of the country\u2019s best art schools, Central Saint Martin\u2019s \u2013 and where rooftop bathers will now be able to wave across to hedge fund managers living in the former railway offices of St Pancras.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWhen we started here, no one thought it was a good idea,\u201d says Peter Murray, the director of Yorkshire Sculpture Park (YSP), as he sits in the cafe that overlooks the rolling 202-hectare (500-acre) estate that opened to the public in 1977. Back then politicians weren\u2019t interested, local residents and businesses didn\u2019t understand it and the only people in favour seemed to be artists, says Murray. \u201cIn the early days there was the constant battling and fighting for funds. Then there\u2019s the politics of the art world and the politics of regional and national government. We had to be incredibly strong willed and bloody minded.\u201d More than 40 years later the stubbornness appears to have paid off. The YSP is at the heart of Yorkshire Sculpture International (YSI), a new festival taking place across Leeds and Wakefield. There\u2019s a Damien Hirst statue in the middle of Briggate, the main shopping street in Leeds. Down the road there\u2019s new work by Rashid Johnson and Cauleen Smith. Five Yorkshire-based sculptors are being supported throughout the 100-day event. The official line is that the Rhubarb Triangle has become the Sculpture Triangle with Leeds Art Gallery, the Henry Moore Institute and the award-winning the Hepworth Wakefield making this area of West Yorkshire arguably the best place in Europe to see sculpture. Murray is hopeful the event will help to further the area\u2019s credentials as an arts mainstay. He uses the German city of Kassel as an example of a place transformed by hosting the Documenta international arts event. There was controversy in Kassel last year over Olu Oguibe\u2019s 50ft (15-metre) obelisk, which the words \u201cI was a stranger and you took me in\u201d written on it in Turkish, Arabic, German, and English. The city was proposing to buy the sculpture to keep permanently, but there were protests by far-right politicians before it eventually returned to the city. In the febrile Brexit atmosphere any use of public space or money can become similarly politicised.

      "body": "<p>I am on a small ward at St Thomas\u2019 hospital in London. There are six beds with a view of the Thames, which is lit by November sunshine. I\u2019m in good health, but scanning my timetable \u2013 I\u2019m here taking part in a two-week scientific study \u2013 is making me feel anaemic. \u201c8.35am: 1st blood draw. 10.05am: 2nd blood draw. 10.20am: 3rd blood draw. 10.50am: 4th blood draw\u2026\u201d on it goes. There will be 10 blood draws in total today, each filling three vials, to be tested for levels of glucose, fat, insulin and other clues as to how efficiently my body metabolises different foods. But these are not just any foods; they are lab-baked muffins with precisely varying amounts of fat, protein, carbohydrate and fibre.</p> <p>The aim of this study \u2013 Predict, a collaboration between King\u2019s College London and Harvard and Stanford medical schools in the US \u2013 is to measure thousands of people\u2019s responses to different foods and discover why, when it comes to health, different diets suit different people. The hope is that when enough data has been gathered researchers (using AI), and eventually an app called Zoe, will be able to predict individual healthy and unhealthy food choices for each of us.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/29/die-now-diet-later-could-nutrigenetics-save-your-life\" title=\"\">Personalised nutrition is a public-health holy grail</a>. Geneticists have striven for decades to develop diets based on genotype as a sophisticated form of preventive medicine. The idea is that eating what is optimal for your unique physiology could shield you from the particular diseases to which you may be susceptible, from certain cancers to diabetes. Such is the complexity of genetics, however, that our understanding is still too fragmented. Not to mention disproving any one-size-fits-all diet advice.</p> <p>Tim Spector, a geneticist at King\u2019s College London, who has in recent years become a leading researcher into the role of gut microbes in health, came up with Predict to help achieve the dream of healthcare becoming preventive, rather than, as it is now, focused on treating disease. \u201cIt\u2019s a real paradigm shift of how people are going to give advice in the future,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were stuck in this time warp of: \u2018Fasting blood test for cholesterol, step on the scales and everyone\u2019s the same.\u2019 It\u2019s clearly much more complicated than that. That\u2019s why diets, if it\u2019s a low-fat diet, a low-carb diet or calorie counting, don\u2019t suit everybody. Despite all the advice, we\u2019re all getting fatter.\u201d</p> <p>The researchers need my blood on tap all day, so I have a cannula inserted into a vein in my left arm. Next, I get a blood-glucose monitor fitted to the back of my right arm. This great gadget, called the FreeStyle Libre, is now widely used by people with type 1 diabetes. A discreet plastic disc about the size of a \u00a32 coin is stuck on to my skin. Only when I remove it after two weeks do I see that a thin metal probe, a few millimetres long, has been in my arm the entire time. The data stored on the disc is read by a handheld device that shows what my blood sugar has been up to.</p> <p>By late morning I have a splitting headache and feel tired and confused. I tell a nurse, fearing that I\u2019ve started running out of blood. She merrily scans my arm to reveal that I\u2019m hypoglycaemic, my glucose level having shot up after breakfast and then straight down into the red zone.</p> <p>The breakfast muffins my fellow participants and I were given were an off-putting shade of indigo, unwholesomely oily and had to be washed down within 10 minutes with yucky-flavoured milk. I now know that they contained twice as much fat as my regular muesli with yoghurt and berries, three times the sugar and precisely no fibre. The lunch muffins are mercifully beige and more fibrous. Back home over the next 11 days, I\u2019ll be eating many more muffins with different nutritional configurations unknown to me. My task will be to attempt to live normally, while eating muffins or other set meals (which include one breakfast of an unbearably large glass of water with glucose dissolved in it) at set times. I\u2019m allowed to eat my own dinners, though, and my own food for the last two days.</p> <p>I have to log all food and drink (even water) in the app, complete with photographs and the weights of individual ingredients. The Predict app tries to make things easy with a friendly dietician only an instant message away, and it prompts if I\u2019ve messed up (cooking from scratch becomes quite the kerfuffle). The blood-letting continues at home. For the first four mornings, at three precise times, I must prick a finger and squeeze out five blobs of blood on to cards, to be refrigerated in foil pouches until ready to be collectively posted back to the lab.</p> <p>Speaking with Spector seven months later, before the release of his first results, it seems to have been worth the effort. \u201cThe variability between people is even greater than I thought,\u201d he says. \u201cThe range of responses to the same foods is huge. To my mind that knocks on the head any idea of an average response or average nutrition. That\u2019s the really big message there.\u201d Analysis of the Predict data has found that the macronutrient breakdown \u2013 such as you find on food labels \u2013 can account for only 40% of how an individual might respond to meals.</p> <p>As a geneticist, Spector started the research registry Twins UK at Kings College in 1992, and has amassed data on 13,000 twins. Almost 250 pairs of identical twins have taken part in Predict and, surprisingly, there were big differences in their responses to foods, too. \u201cClearly our response to food isn\u2019t like many other things like height or weight or anything like that,\u201d says Spector.</p> <p>This means that genetics isn\u2019t the dominant factor in shaping our food responses, which is good news. We\u2019re stuck with our genes, whereas, says Spector, \u201cif you want to modify your responses by changing your behaviour, you can do a lot about it\u201d. Improving how well you can process and clear blood sugar, for instance, is possible by \u201cselecting foods that produce a smaller peak, altering meal times to suit your circadian rhythm, improving your diversity of gut microbes and exercising within the same time to reduce the peaks\u201d. Other likely mechanisms under investigation include sleeping better and going to bed earlier.</p> <p>Vital to Predict\u2019s success will be finding a convenient way to determine which foods help or harm which people. The Zoe app will need biological clues \u2013 or biomarkers \u2013 in order to make predictions, ideally obtained from a quick blood test or stool sample. This is why the researchers are measuring hundreds of metabolites in participants\u2019 blood after eating \u2013 such as ketones \u2013 as well as our gut microbe diversity.</p> <p>We all have up to 2kg of bacteria, yeasts and other microbes living in our guts and emerging science is finding that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/26/the-human-microbiome-why-our-microbes-could-be-key-to-our-health\" title=\"\">our gut microbiomes could be even more revealing about the workings of our bodies</a> than our genes. Humans share more than 99% of our genes, but only 25% of our microbes. Even the study\u2019s identical twins share only 37% of their gut microbes. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/06/microbiome-gut-health-digestive-system-genes-happiness\" title=\"\">The gut microbiome is so related to health</a>,\u201d says Spector. \u201cIt\u2019s related to your weight, your propensity to diabetes, it controls how you metabolise fat \u2026\u201d There is evidence it can also govern gene expression, mood and appetite, make vitamins, and may well be the ultimate biomarker for our food responses.

Time, and the data, will tell.</p> <p>Despite the full-on nature of taking part in the study, Spector says 98% of participants completed it. \u201cNormally, about 20% of people drop out,\u201d he says. This retention rate is largely, I suspect, due to self-interest. Taking part in Predict offers a sneak preview of the personalised nutrition of the future, and a chance to learn about your metabolic quirks.</p> <p>Spector goes through some of my results with me, pointing out, for instance, that if I switch from avocado to peanut butter, considerably more glucose lingers in my bloodstream afterwards \u2013 even though the peanut butter meal is slightly lower in fat and calories. He says that another regular quick lunch \u2013 a low-calorie, bacon and lentil soup \u2013 \u201cfor you, wasn\u2019t particularly healthy\u201d \u2013 as it leaves me with unexpectedly high blood glucose. Spector, who ditched his go-to tuna sandwich after taking part in the study, suggests it may be worth keeping an eye on how lentils affect me in future. On the plus side, the data reveals that my usual breakfast seems to be fine.</p> <p>Next we look at my overall metabolic profile, which scores how well I respond to (or process) fats and carbohydrates compared with all the participants (who are all healthy and disease free). \u201cYour glucose response is pretty much average for your age. It\u2019s not super good, but it\u2019s definitely not bad. And your fat response is slightly better than the average for your age and sex,\u201d he says. </p> <p>I am chuffed to discover that my gut microbiome richness is relatively high. \u201cYou got a score of 70 which is really good,\u201d says Spector. \u201cVirtually nobody got over 80. I\u2019m assuming you have a good, diverse plant-based diet?\u201d Indeed I have been geekily making an effort to feed my microbes in recent years, even fermenting my own sauerkraut, so this is encouraging news.

      "body": "<p>Among the questions regularly asked of journalists are these: Where do you get your stories from? How do stories happen? How do you know a story is a story? And, inevitably, do you make stories up?</p> <p>Given that there is no single, straightforward answer to any of them, especially that contentious last one, I came across an interesting case last week that helps to cast some light on the process \u2013 perhaps I should say, mystery \u2013 of story-getting.</p> <p>A Belfast-based BBC reporter, Chris Lindsay, was casually reading a guidebook on a Singapore Airlines flight when he came across an item about the murals in the city where he works.

The men, both in their 30s, were walking down Manningham Road in the Anfield area of the city at 9.20pm on Saturday when they were approached by three male youths, Merseyside police said. The boys made homophobic insults before one of them produced a knife and assaulted the men. One of the men sustained injuries to his head and neck described as serious but not life-threatening, while the other sustained a minor hand injury. The assault is the latest in a series of homophobic attacks involving teenagers. Earlier this month, five people aged 15 to 18 were arrested after punching a woman and her girlfriend on a London bus when they \u201crefused to kiss\u201d on demand for the boys.

Parkinson said they heard \u201cyoung boys laughing\u201d as the car drove off. The number of homophobic and transphobic hate crimes, including stalking, harassment and violent assault, have more than doubled in England and Wales over five years, Guardian analysis has shown. Between 2014 and 2017, more than 2,500 people under 19 were arrested on suspicion of homophobic assaults, according to police data. DI Tara Denn of Merseyside police said of the Liverpool incident: \u201cThis was an appalling and unprovoked attack on two men simply making their way home and we are working tirelessly to locate those responsible. \u201cTwo men have been left with significant injuries tonight and the hate and violence that has been inflicted on them is simply unacceptable and won\u2019t be tolerated on the streets of Merseyside.\u201d Denn appealed for witnesses and dashcam footage of the attack, saying one boy was wearing a dark \u201cbubble\u201d coat and another was riding a bike.

      "bodyText": "NSW have kept the State of Origin series alive with a dominant 38-6 win over Queensland in a rain-soaked Game 2 at Optus Stadium in Perth. Each of coach Brad Fittler\u2019s contentious recruitment choices paid off for the Blues, with so-called \u201cout-of-position\u201d centres Jack Wighton and Tom Trbojevic having particularly strong games. One of the Blues\u2019 best was James Maloney, who plays the same way whether it\u2019s a generic NRL round game or a must-win Origin clash. Even in steady and, at times, torrential rain, the five-eighth threw passes and held his nerve. He talked all game and through half-time in the sheds, and competed on every play. His Blues team-mates fed off his confidence and played adventurous, dry-weather rugby league in slippery conditions.

      "body": "<p>Hotel kids\u2019 clubs have traditionally been a site of crayons and anxiety, a place for parents to guiltily deposit their children in order to desperately try and pour an entire holiday into two short hours. No more. As the tourist industry begins to recognise the growing family travel market (with 44% of millennial travellers in the US now taking their children on holiday), hotels and resorts are rethinking the role of kids\u2019 clubs.</p> <p>A typical family hotel might have a brightly coloured basement, manned by a smiling woman armed with pens. For a fee, guests can leave their children here for an afternoon to watch a film or play board games. The new breed of kids\u2019 clubs, however, offers not just respite for parents, but a jolly education for the children about their destination. About the culture beyond their hotel pool.</p> <p>\u201cAt <a href=\"https://www.sixsenses.com/resorts/yao-noi/destination\" title=\"\">Six Senses Yao Noi</a> in Thailand, children look after the goats and chickens, tend the kitchen gardens with the gardeners and learn to cook with ingredients grown on site,\u201d says Tamara Lohan, founder of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2017/may/11/mr-mrs-smith-co-founder-rejection-spouse-hotel\" title=\"\">Mr &amp; Mrs Smith</a>. \u201cSpain\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.marbellaclub.com/en/\" title=\"\">Marbella Club</a> offers a really creative programme: kids nurture crops in the vegetable patch, or get experimental in the science lab. Staff at <a href=\"https://www.constancehotels.com/en/hotels-resorts/mauritius/prince-maurice/\" title=\"\">Constance Prince Maurice</a> [in Mauritius] even take groups on frog hunts around the gardens with torches. Kids\u2019 clubs are moving away from the traditional formula by removing the walls of the physical \u2018club\u2019 and encouraging young ones to engage with their environment.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3662cb4426077665a75108e6ad1458f270acc9e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3662cb4426077665a75108e6ad1458f270acc9e4/0_313_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hard Rock Hotel, Ibiza.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sun downers \u2026 Hard Rock Hotel, Ibiza</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We arrived in Ibiza off-season \u2013 the nightclubs were closed, the plane was half-empty, the sky an unfamiliar shade of charcoal. I\u2019d brought my four-year-old before the 7 million or so tourists descend for the summer, to review two of their kids\u2019 clubs. This is an island leaning into its family credentials \u2013 as the partygoers of the 2000s have grown up, Ibiza has adapted to fit, concentrating more on its glamorous rural villas, its yoga retreats and \u201cwellness\u201d opportunities. Still, the shadow of the nightclubs remains long; <a href=\"https://pacha.com/\" title=\"\">Pacha</a>\u2019s jaunty cherry logo rears up in unlikely places, including on baby-gros and bibs, available for \u20ac11.95.</p> <p>Our first visit was to the Hard Rock Hotel, where glinting frames present such cultural ephemera as one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/will-i-am\" title=\"\">will.</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/will-i-am\" title=\"\">i.</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/will-i-am\" title=\"\">am</a>\u2019s shirts, and an outfit Lady Gaga wore for an appearance sponsored by Yahoo. Upon opening the door to our bedroom, we found it filled with balloons. All bedrooms should be this way; every room since has been a disappointment. Theirs is a more traditional kids\u2019 club, complete with VIP-style lanyards and infinite felt tips, but for all my attempts to guide her towards more organic pursuits, these were both things that my daughter found mind-blowingly entertaining.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3054b3fdf1c6245632f60614f87d2b44ff9976a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3054b3fdf1c6245632f60614f87d2b44ff9976a/0_135_667_653/500.jpg\" alt=\"DJ lessons at Nobu Hotel, Ibiza.\" width=\"500\" height=\"490\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spinning discs \u2026 DJ lessons at Nobu Hotel, Ibiza</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR IMAGE</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We drove to the crossroads in Buscastell and ate tapas at <a href=\"http://www.cantixedo.com/\" title=\"\">Can Tixedo</a>, where a barefoot drinker scribbled drawings for diners, who in return pressed cash on him as if he\u2019d performed a striptease. My child, primed with the kids\u2019 club pens, presented him with a colourful portrait before he could draw us, and he was less than impressed. Afterwards we trooped along the beach with our coats on, and climbed a 16th-century defence tower to gaze out at a choppy sea.</p> <p>The next day we moved to the Nobu Hotel, an elegant ivory and blue oasis that appears, until the staff greet guests\u2019 children by their first names, intimidatingly grown-up. The rooms are arranged around two swimming pools, one of which is for families, the kids\u2019 club situated at its corner.

      "bodyText": "Hotel kids\u2019 clubs have traditionally been a site of crayons and anxiety, a place for parents to guiltily deposit their children in order to desperately try and pour an entire holiday into two short hours. No more. As the tourist industry begins to recognise the growing family travel market (with 44% of millennial travellers in the US now taking their children on holiday), hotels and resorts are rethinking the role of kids\u2019 clubs. A typical family hotel might have a brightly coloured basement, manned by a smiling woman armed with pens. For a fee, guests can leave their children here for an afternoon to watch a film or play board games. The new breed of kids\u2019 clubs, however, offers not just respite for parents, but a jolly education for the children about their destination. About the culture beyond their hotel pool. \u201cAt Six Senses Yao Noi in Thailand, children look after the goats and chickens, tend the kitchen gardens with the gardeners and learn to cook with ingredients grown on site,\u201d says Tamara Lohan, founder of Mr &amp; Mrs Smith. \u201cSpain\u2019s Marbella Club offers a really creative programme: kids nurture crops in the vegetable patch, or get experimental in the science lab. Staff at Constance Prince Maurice [in Mauritius] even take groups on frog hunts around the gardens with torches. Kids\u2019 clubs are moving away from the traditional formula by removing the walls of the physical \u2018club\u2019 and encouraging young ones to engage with their environment.\u201d We arrived in Ibiza off-season \u2013 the nightclubs were closed, the plane was half-empty, the sky an unfamiliar shade of charcoal. I\u2019d brought my four-year-old before the 7 million or so tourists descend for the summer, to review two of their kids\u2019 clubs. This is an island leaning into its family credentials \u2013 as the partygoers of the 2000s have grown up, Ibiza has adapted to fit, concentrating more on its glamorous rural villas, its yoga retreats and \u201cwellness\u201d opportunities. Still, the shadow of the nightclubs remains long; Pacha\u2019s jaunty cherry logo rears up in unlikely places, including on baby-gros and bibs, available for \u20ac11.95. Our first visit was to the Hard Rock Hotel, where glinting frames present such cultural ephemera as one of will.i.am\u2019s shirts, and an outfit Lady Gaga wore for an appearance sponsored by Yahoo. Upon opening the door to our bedroom, we found it filled with balloons. All bedrooms should be this way; every room since has been a disappointment. Theirs is a more traditional kids\u2019 club, complete with VIP-style lanyards and infinite felt tips, but for all my attempts to guide her towards more organic pursuits, these were both things that my daughter found mind-blowingly entertaining. We drove to the crossroads in Buscastell and ate tapas at Can Tixedo, where a barefoot drinker scribbled drawings for diners, who in return pressed cash on him as if he\u2019d performed a striptease. My child, primed with the kids\u2019 club pens, presented him with a colourful portrait before he could draw us, and he was less than impressed. Afterwards we trooped along the beach with our coats on, and climbed a 16th-century defence tower to gaze out at a choppy sea. The next day we moved to the Nobu Hotel, an elegant ivory and blue oasis that appears, until the staff greet guests\u2019 children by their first names, intimidatingly grown-up. The rooms are arranged around two swimming pools, one of which is for families, the kids\u2019 club situated at its corner. Here, alongside the ubiquitous crayons, not only are children invited to become mixologists at the poolside juice bar but they offer DJ lessons. The families staying were white-shirted and moneyed \u2013 some had brought their nannies \u2013 and many appeared to be employed in the upper echelons of the nightclub industry. It seemed only right their toddlers should spend their holiday learning the family business.

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s all she wrote from yours truly. A rare Origin trouncing for Queensland in the wet and wind of Perth. Everything on the line now for Game 3 - where the Maroons will need to recover physically as well as mentally. And fast. Brad Fittler, take a bow - the Blues coach put his neck on the line with all those changes and has been well and truly vindicated. Thanks for joining me, catch you next time. It\u2019s not all good news for NSW though. It looks like Cleary is going to struggle to make Game 3. AAP: NSW halfback Nathan Cleary could be in doubt for State of Origin III after suffering a suspected ankle injury in their game two win in Perth. Cleary played under duress for the final 10 minutes of the first half following an awkward tackle, and failed to take the field in the second half. His possible absence for game three would almost certainly bring former Blues No.7 Mitchell Pearce back into contention for the decider in Sydney. Jimmy Maloney: \u201cIt\u2019s awesome, the boys had a really big game, everyone played a part. We backed ourselves to play footy and didn\u2019t back away from the physical confrontation.\u201d \u201cStoked\u201d seems to be the word of the day as the Blues stars talk after the game. Hat-trick hero Tom Trbojevic is \u201cstoked\u201d every time he gets a try for the Blues. \u201cObviously, very pleased,\u201d he says, rather obviously, when asked about his three tries. An Origin thumping in the wet and wild west of Perth. There was a brief spell in the first-half when Queensland had a bit of pressure, but other than that it was pretty much one-way traffic. The scoreline tells the tale. All eyes on Sydney. 79 mins: Wednesday, July 10th, for those of you wondering when the deciding Game 3 is. 77 mins: I don\u2019t know if Brad Fittler knows how to be smug (he seems quite amiable) but he must be thrilled with how his instincts have paid off tonight, especially after all that media criticism for chopping and changing the team. 76 mins: Did someone say mental scarring? How will this mauling affect the Queenslanders mentally for Game 3? Have the Blues even finished for the night? 73 mins: The Blues were just too fast (and too many) for Queensland. Some tired, tired legs in maroon shirts. Blues players were queuing up to go over on the left flank, Addo-Carr with the final touch. 71 mins: Into the final 10 minutes, and all the momentum is with the Blues. Some good tries from NSW but some silly penalties from the Maroons. It\u2019s tempting to think NSW will be favourites for the series now as we head towards Game 3 but, just to put things in perspective, the Maroons have won the past seven series when they\u2019ve won Game 1. As I said before - rather warily - never write them off. 68 mins: Ferguson loses a boot as the Blues start rolling up the field again. A little bit of fire has gone out the game - highly unusual for Origin. 67 mins: Good field position for the Maroons after a 40-20. A try now might at least lift them for the final game. 64 mins: The Blues have a chance to make a statement tonight but the Maroons have started to battle back a little. They look shattered though - the price of all that defending. The Blues chomping up metres again. 62 mins: I\u2019m trying to work out if the Blues have stepped off the gas slightly or the Maroons have stepped it up. Probably a bit of both. Just as I\u2019m writing that, Gagai gets within an inch of the line but is held up. Better from Queensland. 61 mins: The Maroons try to string something together but when the kick comes at the end of the set, Ferguson gets it and throws a 20m bullseye pass to Tedesco. The Blues are in the zone. Maroons struggling for an answer. 59 mins: Maloney misses the kick but it shouldn\u2019t cost the Blues. Shouldn\u2019t. 59 mins: This is getting ugly. Addo-Carr this time, diving on the ball as it bounces over the try line from a kick. 57 mins: It never usually pays to write off Queensland but it\u2019s going to take something monumental for them to come back from this one. Eyes starting to turn to Sydney and Game 3. And Maloney with the cherry on the cake. 55 mins: Addo-Carr with a burst of speed, Tedesco with a lovely flick, and Trbojevic is there to finish it off. A hat-trick for the Sea Eagle. Fittler being justified with every try. 52 mins: The Maroons struggling to get out of their half at the minute. It\u2019s not looking good. How much is the absence of Jai Arrow costing them? The Blues are handling the conditions much better. You can sense the frustration among the Queenslanders. Daylight for the Blues. 49 mins: Bit of biff off the ball as the Blues kick downfield. Not entirely sure what went on there ... although the replays point to the culprit: Jarrod Wallace rushing into the kicker after the ball had played - it was late and high. NSW back on the front foot. Wallace back on the bench. 47 mins: A bit of a stoppage due to an injury for Glasby, and the Blues resume just short of the Maroons line. Another try now and that could be game over. The Queenslanders cling on though. They need to apply some pressure at the other end. 46 mins: All the momentum is with the Blues at the minute. They get another penalty as Ferguson is knocked over while chasing a high ball. Odd tackle - Ferguson wasn\u2019t really in a dangerous position. The Maroons look rattled. 44 mins: The Maroons give away a penalty and the Blues take the points on offer. They\u2019re starting to turn the screw. Cleary is out for the Blues, injured. 42 mins: Just to go back to Lynn\u2019s email at half-time - Queensland got a couple of tries right in the corner in Game 1 but they haven\u2019t really had a sniff this game. They need to start asking questions of this Blues defence because they\u2019ve had it too easy so far, and it\u2019s looking that way again at the start of the second. 41 mins: OK we\u2019re off again and the blog now has some shiny new photos to go with the tries. Let\u2019s get this show back on the road. Maroons charging forward. \u201cQld should be using their wingers instead of going through the middle, throw the ball around. Make it interesting.\u201d Lynn Stevenson, email \u201cOver in Perth and at the game. Shame about the rain but a great game so far. Oh, and this stadium...simply immense. Smashes everything I have been to elsewhere in Oz. Go Blues!\u201d Martin Turnbull, email And that\u2019s it for the first-half. The Blues in control although I strongly suspect the Maroons will come out revved up after the break. See you soon. 39 mins: The Blues have the scent of blood in their nostrils as we head towards the break. They\u2019re hungry for more points but they\u2019ll have to settle for what they\u2019ve got. The Maroons need to regroup. 38 mins: Maloney with another break. Great running but then he fluffs the attempted grubber, barely connecting with the ball and the Maroons breath again. The Blues finishing the half very strongly. Maroons need to fire back, or at least stem the tide before half-time. 36 mins: It\u2019s Trbojevic\u2019s try, but it was all about Tedesco. Great strength and vision from the Roosters man, with a run that drew so many Queenslanders that when the pass finally came, Trbojevic only had to stroll over. 34 mins: Blues still on the attack, the Maroons clinging on a little bit. They\u2019re trying to make up some metres now. It\u2019s hard going though, NSW making them work for every inch. 32 mins: Addo-Carr goes over at the edge - but it\u2019s called for a forward pass. The Storm man is not happy with that one. Tight. 32 mins: Someone\u2019s backside (possibly DCE\u2019s) was revealed for a few seconds there (the result of a reverse wedgie), temporarily mooning the Optus Stadium crowd. It seemed to distract the Blues as much as me, with the Maroons promptly marauding up the field. Some desperate defending keeps them at bay. 31 mins: Good running from Morgan puts the Maroons within 10m. Munster aaaalmost carries it over the line on the next pass but is just about stopped by a sea of Blue. NSW gather the kick and relieve the pressure. 31 mins: Blues clawing their way forward. Maloney with the kick, Ponga takes it, and the Maroons on the attack again. I suspect there\u2019ll be a couple more key weather-related mistakes before this game is over. 30 mins: A break for NSW as Oates is bundled over the line. He tried to change direction but slipped as he locked his feet in. 28 mins: Ferguson puts down a high ball near his own line and the Maroons have a chance. The rain taking its toll. It just slipped right through his hands. 27 mins: It\u2019s absolutely hurling it down out there. Bit of wind too. Mistakes ahoy. The Blues are close to the Maroons\u2019 line again too. Queensland have a scrum though. 25 mins: And NSW are back in front by six. Good work from Maloney. The Blues push and probe, it ends up with Frizell who barges his way through the final few metres to score. Blues back in front. 23 mins: Penalty to the Blues, and they have another great chance to attack the line. 21 mins: Good work by Cleary gives the Blues a chance from 20m. The line is teasingly close. Graham tries to find a way through, twice, but the Maroons stand firm and the final kick gifts them possession. 19 mins: Dead in front and right through the middle. All square again. 16 mins: Good defence from the Blues is undone when Jack Wighton blocks the man chasing the ball (Will Chambers) from a grubber over the try line. And that\u2019s that. Maroons get a gift. 14 mins: A tackle in the air gives Qld some room to breathe. They\u2019re starting to inch their way up the ground. DCE is leading the charge, trying to find a way back for his side. Maroons having a bit of a spell. 12 mins: All the pressure on the Maroons at the minute, trying to break out of their own half. Even DCE looks like he\u2019s struggling for options. Blues with their tails up. No mistake from the boot and a new-look NSW are on top. 8 mins: Trbojevic outjumps Ponga to a high ball and gets it down over the line. Great catch, great kick and NSW have first blood. 8 mins: Chambers almost gets on the end of a ball over the line but he was always unlikely to get on top of it and get it down before it rolled out of play. Still, better from the Maroons, and all from that forward pass by NSW. The Blues are bouncing back now. Probing forward. 7 mins: A poor forward throw eases some of the pressure on Queensland. The Maroons will take that. It\u2019s not been a classic so far. Think the weather/conditions are taking a toll. 5 mins: Addo-Carr makes up some metres down the left edge. Wighton follows suit and then the Blues spread it all the way down to the right and Tom Trbojevic gets over the line but is well held up. Good stuff from NSW. 4 mins: No Origin magic so far, although the Blues get a knock-on. Looks a bit slippy out there. We could see more errors than usual tonight. 2 mins: The Blues make it all the way up to the 20m line and then keep Qld at bay on the return set. Saifiti trying to make some ground on his debut. He looks up for it. 1 min: Queensland with the kick and, with an almighty roar, and a few pyrotechnics, we\u2019re away. Acknowledgment and anthem. Here we go. The anthem reaches a crescendo and the players get into position. We\u2019re almost there. NSW are out on the pitch. Maroons just about to follow - they don\u2019t seem to be in any sort of rush. Bit of mind games maybe? The fans in Perth are up for this. Not long to go. Just enough time to read up Matt Cleary\u2019s preview of the match. Fittler made seven changes and pundits and punters alike have been in a flap. People don\u2019t understand why there are fullbacks in the centres, the halfback is not the dominant \u201cquarterback\u201d, and Latrell Mitchell is in Taree Moses Mbye. Forget Sam Burgess\u2019 broken eye socket, or Cooper Cronk\u2019s fractured scapula - Mbye had what was described as a life-threatening anaphylactic shock after breakfast a couple of days ago, but will still play for the Maroons today. Still no news on what might have caused the severe allergic reaction, but I bet he eyed his Coco Pops with a degree of suspicion this morning. \u201cI\u2019m not quite sure what it was that triggered it. I had a handful of things that morning. I had some brekky and juice, it was a standard sort of day and it was nothing out of the ordinary.\u201d Moses Mbye Blues Mk II. Anyway, back on topic. Say what you want about Fittler\u2019s decision to overhaul the squad - and most of us have - but he\u2019s clearly not afraid to back his own judgement. Put bluntly, he\u2019s wearing this one - whatever the result. If they win, he\u2019ll be hailed as a genius, but if they lose... eesh. And if this all sounds slightly familiar it\u2019s possibly because people were saying the same thing about Kevin Walters before Game 1. Stories of coach whisperers and bans on speaking about NSW all came with a subtle hint of \u201cthis guy is desperate\u201d. And look how that turned out. The Tonga test. Talking of raining on parades, Tonga\u2019s highs of 2017 seemed a long time ago last night in arguably the weekend\u2019s biggest non-Origin footy game (in this hemisphere at least). The Mate Ma\u2019a made the scoreline semi-respectable towards the end but were outclassed by the clinical Kiwis in a 34-14 defeat. \u201cThey controlled the ruck a lot better than us, particularly with one referee, and we let a few tries through there and that was disappointing,\u201d coach Kristian Woolf said. \u201cThose three tries from dummy half were the most disappointing thing for me. Brandon Smith is a very good player and he showed how strong he is.\u201d The weather. Amid all the many talking points since Game 1, the weather in Perth has gone a little under the radar, so to speak. Yesterday the city centre was drenched with 60mm of rain. It\u2019s not as bad today but the threat of showers has hung in the air all day. On a hard Optus Stadium surface with short grass, all that rain could have a huge bearing on the game. Expect the ball to skim along the surface. \u201cWe\u2019ve prepared for that and I\u2019m sure Queensland would have as well. The forecast, everyone tells me the forecast is right over here in WA so we\u2019re expecting rain,\u201d Danny Buderus said. Kick-off. Apparently we\u2019re still down for a 7.50pm (AEST) start although I always take that with a pinch of salt. Is that Eskimo Joe rocking up in the rafters? If only it was Brad Fittler - then I could do my Fittler on the roof pun. Apologies. The teams. A familiar Queensland side looks as imposing as ever, even without Jai Arrow, but it\u2019s all change once again for the Blues under Freddy. Is it a better NSW side than Game 1 or have all those changes undermined team structure? Is it possible both those statements might be true? Rumours that Dale Finucane might get the nod to start at lock have been confirmed. NSW: James Tedesco, Blake Ferguson, Tom Trbojevic, Jack Wighton, Josh Addo-Carr, James Maloney, Nathan Cleary, Daniel Saifiti, Damien Cook, Jake Trbojevic, Boyd Cordner (capt), Tyson Frizell, Dale Finucane. Res: Paul Vaughan, Tariq Sims, Cameron Murray, Wade Graham. Queensland: Kalyn Ponga, Corey Oates, Michael Morgan, Will Chambers, Dane Gagai, Cameron Munster, Daly Cherry-Evans (capt), Dylan Napa, Ben Hunt, Josh Papalii, Felise Kaufusi, Matt Gillett, Josh McGuire. Res: Moses Mbye, Jarrod Wallace, Tim Glasby, David Fifita. Evening everyone, thanks for joining me as we head west for Perth\u2019s first State of Origin clash. And although Game 2 is heading to pastures new, the series itself is in all too familiar territory, with Queensland just one win away from sealing the shield while the Blues search for answers after a demoralising first-up loss in Brisbane. This wasn\u2019t how it was supposed to pan out, of course, especially after last year. In the post-Thurston, Smith, Inglis, Cronk, Slater footy world, Brad Fittler was meant to be ushering in a new era of Blues dominance. Then Game 1 happened, and suddenly confidence in NSW was crumbling quicker than the state\u2019s apartment blocks. So was last year\u2019s series victory just another blue blip in a sea of maroon? Or will Fittler\u2019s much-changed Blues finally silence Queensland\u2019s coach whisperings. Anyone who thought Game 1 might answer a few questions was sadly mistaken \u2013 there seem to be even more now - and those who reckon they know how things are going to unfold tonight is fooling themselves. Whatever happens, it\u2019s Origin, so there\u2019s no need for me to oversell it. Just strap yourself in. Feel free to get in touch on email at richard.gadsby.casual.guardian.co.uk.",

      "bodyText": "Spare a thought for Ed Woodward. As if Paul Pogba issuing a come-and-get-me plea so unsubtle he might as well have jumped out of a cake in the shape of the Bernab\u00e9u was not distracting enough, now there are claims that Manchester United\u2019s executive vice-chairman is having trouble with an unruly director pushing for Steve Walsh to fill the director of football role at Old Trafford. You can understand Woodward\u2019s reservations. On the one hand Walsh is the man credited with bringing N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 and Riyad Mahrez to Leicester City. On the other he took the blame for a splurge that resulted in Everton starting the 2017-18 season with 473 creative midfielders and ending it with supporters urging Sam Allardyce to eff off, which is something Walsh might want to gloss over at his next job interview. Back to that insubordinate director, though. Just who is \u201cSir Alex Ferguson\u201d anyway? And how many commercial deals has he got over the line? The internet offers few clues, though it does suggest this Ferguson character held some kind of important role in United\u2019s football department for quite a long time, only for it to all end in tears when he provided David Moyes with a glowing reference. Honestly. To think they made him a knight of the realm. Best to leave it to Ed the Red, then. Until United do appoint a director of football, that is. Only, weren\u2019t they supposed to have had one in place by now?

Van Gaal added that he was never asked about football when he was interviewed for the United job in 2014 and in that context it is possible to see how a club can lurch from a possession-based manager like the Dutchman to a pragmatist like Mourinho, before getting all misty-eyed and appointing Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r.

Tom Penn went public on Saturday as the neighbour who had recorded the argument in the early hours of Friday morning. He said he had dialled 999 because he had been \u201cfrightened and concerned for the welfare of those involved\u201d. Penn, who has lived in his south London flat with his wife for just over a year, said he contacted the police only as a last resort after knocking three times at the couple\u2019s front door.

The frontrunner repeatedly dodged questions about the incident during a televised hustings on Saturday. Symonds can be heard on Penn\u2019s recording telling Johnson, 55, to \u201cget off me\u201d and \u201cget out of my flat\u201d.

      "body": "<p>The new prime minister could hardly have chosen a worse moment to enter Downing Street. Growth had stalled, there was serious trouble in the Middle East, the government\u2019s flagship policy had made it deeply unpopular. Yet at the next general election, the Conservative party won an overall majority against all the odds.</p> <p>That was how things panned out for John Major after he took over from Margaret Thatcher in late 1990. The economy had just entered a recession that resulted in record bankruptcies and home repossessions; oil prices were soaring after Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait; and Britain had been convulsed by a summer of poll tax riots. The economy actually got a lot worse during the course of 1991 but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/electionspast/page/0,,1450583,00.html\">Major still won in April 1992</a>.</p> <p>So can either <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/22/boris-johnson-under-fire-questions-hustings-late-night-argument\">Boris Johnson</a> or Jeremy Hunt do what Major did? There are plenty of Conservatives who think they can, which is why there is speculation about a snap autumn election. It doesn\u2019t really matter that the economy is struggling because the lesson of 1992 is that when times are tough, voters are fearful of change and if they would not vote for Neil Kinnock and his shadow chancellor, John Smith, why would they vote for Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell?</p> <p>It may, though, not be so simple this time. For a start, Major\u2019s success in 1992 was based on his success in ditching the poll tax, the policy that had made Thatcher and the Conservatives so unpopular, and replacing it with the council tax. But that simply involved replacing one form of local government finance with another and chucking some money at the problem. It did not involve a negotiation with 27 other European countries, which is what will be needed to remove the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit </a>monkey from the government\u2019s back.</p> <p>Nor should the Conservative party assume that it will automatically win on economic competence. The years since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/11/david-cameron-uk-prime-minister\">David Cameron became prime minister in 2010</a> have not been easy and they have not been prosperous. Labour will go into the next election saying that the Tories are the party of austerity and economic failure.</p> <p>Although the economic data was still grim in early 1992, Major had no choice but to call an election because a five-year parliament had all but run its course. Johnson and Hunt do not have to go to the country until the middle of 2022 and when you have wanted to own the keys to No 10 for your entire political life it is extremely hard to take the risk of early ejection from your new abode.</p> <p>Just ask Gordon Brown, who thought about seeking his own mandate shortly after taking over from Tony Blair in the summer of 2007 but passed up the opportunity.</p> <p>Likewise, Theresa May would have done a lot better to have gone to the country in the autumn of 2016 rather than wait until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/general-election-2017\">the following spring</a>. In late 2016 the economy was doing a lot better than either the Bank of England or the Treasury had predicted. By 2017, living standards were being squeezed hard by the higher inflation caused by the depreciation of the pound. It was the worst possible time to hold an election.</p> <p>This autumn doesn\u2019t look a lot more promising for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservative-leadership\">the new Conservative PM</a>. For a start, the international outlook is rotten. The US and China are at loggerheads over trade. Oil prices are going up because Donald Trump seems to want to start a war with Iran. What\u2019s more, the world\u2019s two most important central banks \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-19/fed-scraps-patient-rate-approach-in-prelude-to-potential-cut\">Federal Reserve </a>and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/18/donald-trump-attacks-ecb-for-currency-manipulation\">European Central Bank </a>\u2013 signalled last week that they intend to cut interest rates over the coming months. Economy activity has slowed and inflationary pressure is weak.</p> <p>The new prime minister will take office shortly before the growth figures for the second quarter of 2019 are published by the Office for National Statistics and these will show \u2013 at best \u2013 that the UK struggled to expand at all in the three months to June. It is quite conceivable that the economy contracted.</p> <p>To be sure, some of the weakness of the economy in the second quarter is payback for the strong growth in the first quarter, when firms were stockpiling in the run-up to the original late March deadline for Brexit.</p> <p>The new PM will have two things going for him. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/11/uk-jobs-growth-slows-amid-brexit-uncertainty\">Wages are growing faster than inflation</a>, which means that living standards are rising. The annual increase in earnings adjusted for prices is not spectacular at about just over 1% but at least it is a contrast with 2017.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian business email sign-up\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Second, the public finances are in better shape than they were. Again, the improvement should not be exaggerated. Nine years after Cameron\u2019s coalition government came to power pledging to sort out the deficit in one five-year parliament, the UK is still on course to borrow getting on for \u00a330bn in the current financial year. But there will be scope for the chancellor to raise public spending or cut taxes in the autumn budget.</p> <p>From an economic perspective, the new prime minister would be better off waiting until next spring. By then, voters will have had almost another year of rising living standards and \u2013 if Johnson and Hunt are to be believed \u2013 Britain will be out of the EU.</p> <p>Voters will also have started to feel the impact of any changes made in the budget, which will come into force in April. Major kicked off his campaign in 1992 with a tax-cutting budget and spent the next few weeks banging away at Labour\u2019s \u201ctax bombshell\u201d. McDonnell says his party is geared up to fight an early election. If one comes, Labour knows what it can expect.</p>",

For a start, Major\u2019s success in 1992 was based on his success in ditching the poll tax, the policy that had made Thatcher and the Conservatives so unpopular, and replacing it with the council tax. But that simply involved replacing one form of local government finance with another and chucking some money at the problem. It did not involve a negotiation with 27 other European countries, which is what will be needed to remove the Brexit monkey from the government\u2019s back. Nor should the Conservative party assume that it will automatically win on economic competence. The years since David Cameron became prime minister in 2010 have not been easy and they have not been prosperous. Labour will go into the next election saying that the Tories are the party of austerity and economic failure. Although the economic data was still grim in early 1992, Major had no choice but to call an election because a five-year parliament had all but run its course. Johnson and Hunt do not have to go to the country until the middle of 2022 and when you have wanted to own the keys to No 10 for your entire political life it is extremely hard to take the risk of early ejection from your new abode. Just ask Gordon Brown, who thought about seeking his own mandate shortly after taking over from Tony Blair in the summer of 2007 but passed up the opportunity. Likewise, Theresa May would have done a lot better to have gone to the country in the autumn of 2016 rather than wait until the following spring. In late 2016 the economy was doing a lot better than either the Bank of England or the Treasury had predicted. By 2017, living standards were being squeezed hard by the higher inflation caused by the depreciation of the pound. It was the worst possible time to hold an election. This autumn doesn\u2019t look a lot more promising for the new Conservative PM. For a start, the international outlook is rotten. The US and China are at loggerheads over trade. Oil prices are going up because Donald Trump seems to want to start a war with Iran. What\u2019s more, the world\u2019s two most important central banks \u2013 the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank \u2013 signalled last week that they intend to cut interest rates over the coming months. Economy activity has slowed and inflationary pressure is weak. The new prime minister will take office shortly before the growth figures for the second quarter of 2019 are published by the Office for National Statistics and these will show \u2013 at best \u2013 that the UK struggled to expand at all in the three months to June. It is quite conceivable that the economy contracted. To be sure, some of the weakness of the economy in the second quarter is payback for the strong growth in the first quarter, when firms were stockpiling in the run-up to the original late March deadline for Brexit. The new PM will have two things going for him. Wages are growing faster than inflation, which means that living standards are rising. The annual increase in earnings adjusted for prices is not spectacular at about just over 1% but at least it is a contrast with 2017. Second, the public finances are in better shape than they were. Again, the improvement should not be exaggerated. Nine years after Cameron\u2019s coalition government came to power pledging to sort out the deficit in one five-year parliament, the UK is still on course to borrow getting on for \u00a330bn in the current financial year. But there will be scope for the chancellor to raise public spending or cut taxes in the autumn budget. From an economic perspective, the new prime minister would be better off waiting until next spring. By then, voters will have had almost another year of rising living standards and \u2013 if Johnson and Hunt are to be believed \u2013 Britain will be out of the EU. Voters will also have started to feel the impact of any changes made in the budget, which will come into force in April. Major kicked off his campaign in 1992 with a tax-cutting budget and spent the next few weeks banging away at Labour\u2019s \u201ctax bombshell\u201d. McDonnell says his party is geared up to fight an early election. If one comes, Labour knows what it can expect.",

Capt Mark Dunkley, the CPPU senior adviser and an army reservist, said: \u201cCulturecide is being seen to be a parallel occupation with genocide, to deliberately destroy cultural identity,\u201d, with the three motivating factors seen as ideology, display of power, and economic.

      "body": "<h2>Fragrance to capture the essence of summer</h2> <p>We\u2019ve been indoctrinated into the concept of a \u201csummer fragrance\u201d \u2013 floral, pretty, sweet, citrus. In reality, the idea is nonsensical. A summer fragrance is whatever you choose to wear, so don\u2019t feel obliged to play by the rules. Diptyque\u2019s Eau de Minth\u00e9 is slightly off the beaten track: yes there\u2019s a floral (rose) accord, but the predominant notes are mint and nutmeg. Jo Malone x Huntsman Birch and Black Pepper is touted as a men\u2019s fragrance, but I\u2019d happily wear its smoky sexiness all year long. If you gravitate towards a sophisticated floral, there is plenty on offer. Cloon Keen\u2019s L\u00e1 Bealtaine \u2013 a blend of jasmine, tuberose, mandarin, bergamot and neroli \u2013 is unapologetically ultra-feminine. Burberry\u2019s Her Blossom and Gucci Bloom also fit well into the archetypal floral family. Prada\u2019s Water Splash does, too, but it infuses the green notes of the frangipani flower with a touch of mandarin. Byredo also taps into the mandarin, but blends it with jasmine and cotton candy. Orange Sanguine by Atelier Cologne captures freshly cut oranges in a bottle and is totally gender neutral, as is Clean\u2019s Solar Bloom \u2013 a floral with the base note of patchouli. And for a bit of nostalgia there\u2019s always the special summer edition of CK One \u2013 a throwback to the days when \u201csummer fragrances\u201d were all the rage.</p> <p><strong>Top row, from left: Diptyque Eau de Minth\u00e9 Eau de Parfum</strong> \u00a3120, <a href=\"http://spacenk.com\">spacenk.com</a><br><strong>Gucci Bloom Eau de Parfum</strong> \u00a352, <a href=\"http://johnlewis.com\">johnlewis.com</a><br><strong>Byredo Sundazed Eau de Parfum</strong> \u00a3165, <a href=\"http://spacenk.com\">spacenk.com</a><br><strong>Calvin Klein CK One Summer 2019 Limited Edition Eau de Toilette</strong> \u00a340, <a href=\"http://lookfantastic.com\">lookfantastic.com</a><br><strong>Burberry Her Blossom Eau de Toilette</strong> \u00a360, <a href=\"http://johnlewis.com\">johnlewis.com</a></p> <p><strong>Bottom row, from left: Clean Reserve Solar Bloom Eau de Parfum</strong> \u00a382, <a href=\"http://spacenk.com\">spacenk.com</a><br><strong>Cloon Keen L\u00e1 Bealtaine</strong> \u00a3120, <a href=\"http://lessenteurs.com\">lessenteurs.com</a><br><strong>Prada La Femme Water Splash Eau de Parfum</strong> \u00a3106.50, <a href=\"http://selfridges.com\">selfridges.com</a><br><strong>Jo Malone London x Huntsman Birch and Black Pepper Cologne</strong> \u00a3120, <a href=\"http://harrods.com\">harrods.com</a><br><strong>Atelier Cologne Orange Sanguine Cologne Absolue Limited Edition</strong> \u00a395, <a href=\"http://johnlewis.com\">johnlewis.com</a></p> <h2>Makeup with a lighter touch</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a5133b1aa3934ab6d14f757daa23a2f34e0cf5f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5133b1aa3934ab6d14f757daa23a2f34e0cf5f7/0_666_5440_4750/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Top 10 cosmetics\" width=\"1000\" height=\"873\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hotter days call for lighter makeup products</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beate Sonnenberg/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I understand why many people consider wearing makeup in summer something of an oxymoron. Choices that work perfectly well in autumnal climes, like a decent foundation and a smoky eye, suddenly seem OTT and no longer feel like they have any business on your face. Additionally, not all makeup is comfortable on the skin in the heat and many products wither under the pressure. And so the potential for looking totally out of step is real. However, the prevailing mindset that we should forego makeup in summer (because it\u2019s all about being \u201cnatural\u201d) doesn\u2019t work for everyone \u2013 many, like me, want maquillage all year round and there is no sin in that. Wearing it well is all about clever application and key products. Bronzers and highlighters are the quickest ways to deliver colour, glow and life to the skin.

Ideally you should use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with <br> both UVB (protects against the burn) and UVA (protects against premature ageing). For sunscreen to be truly effective you should be applying it at least 20 minutes before leaving the house, reapplying every two hours and, no, you can\u2019t use the same old one you\u2019ve been wheeling out for the past five years.

      "bodyText": "Fragrance to capture the essence of summer We\u2019ve been indoctrinated into the concept of a \u201csummer fragrance\u201d \u2013 floral, pretty, sweet, citrus. In reality, the idea is nonsensical. A summer fragrance is whatever you choose to wear, so don\u2019t feel obliged to play by the rules. Diptyque\u2019s Eau de Minth\u00e9 is slightly off the beaten track: yes there\u2019s a floral (rose) accord, but the predominant notes are mint and nutmeg. Jo Malone x Huntsman Birch and Black Pepper is touted as a men\u2019s fragrance, but I\u2019d happily wear its smoky sexiness all year long. If you gravitate towards a sophisticated floral, there is plenty on offer. Cloon Keen\u2019s L\u00e1 Bealtaine \u2013 a blend of jasmine, tuberose, mandarin, bergamot and neroli \u2013 is unapologetically ultra-feminine. Burberry\u2019s Her Blossom and Gucci Bloom also fit well into the archetypal floral family. Prada\u2019s Water Splash does, too, but it infuses the green notes of the frangipani flower with a touch of mandarin. Byredo also taps into the mandarin, but blends it with jasmine and cotton candy. Orange Sanguine by Atelier Cologne captures freshly cut oranges in a bottle and is totally gender neutral, as is Clean\u2019s Solar Bloom \u2013 a floral with the base note of patchouli. And for a bit of nostalgia there\u2019s always the special summer edition of CK One \u2013 a throwback to the days when \u201csummer fragrances\u201d were all the rage.

Choices that work perfectly well in autumnal climes, like a decent foundation and a smoky eye, suddenly seem OTT and no longer feel like they have any business on your face. Additionally, not all makeup is comfortable on the skin in the heat and many products wither under the pressure. And so the potential for looking totally out of step is real. However, the prevailing mindset that we should forego makeup in summer (because it\u2019s all about being \u201cnatural\u201d) doesn\u2019t work for everyone \u2013 many, like me, want maquillage all year round and there is no sin in that. Wearing it well is all about clever application and key products. Bronzers and highlighters are the quickest ways to deliver colour, glow and life to the skin. I\u2019ve found scraping a tiny bit of powder highlighter and blending it into your serum is a brilliant application technique. Blushers always add youthfulness, a pop of colour on the lips distracts from lacklustre skin, waterproof mascara is obligatory and if you do still want a cover-up without the weight, mix foundation with hyaluronic acid and apply.

      "body": "<p>The Ukrainian <a href=\"https://www.askonasholt.com/artists/andrei-kymach/\">Andrei Kymach</a> was just a babe in arms when Dmitri Hvorostovsky took the Cardiff Singer of the World title in 1989, but that his burnished baritone occasionally reminded one of that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/22/dmitri-hvorostovsky-obituary\">much-missed Russian</a> only added to the conviction that Kymach was a most worthy winner this year. An aristocratic presence on stage, the integrity and focus of his musical and dramatic characterisation across the week of competition was compelling. Only the words mattered.</p> <p>Not that Kymach\u2019s win was a walkover. The Chinese tenor <a href=\"https://www.mingjielei.com/bio\">Mingjie Lei</a>\u2019s charm and sincerity were obvious, his high tenor very even and surprisingly mellow. Winning his earlier round with easy accomplishment marked him as a future star, and his lieder singing won him the coveted song prize on Thursday.</p> <p>For those who make the final of both the song and main prize categories, with little time to recover between their four performances, the vocal stamina involved inevitably means traces of fatigue coming through by the end. And with the television coverage and attendant chat not unlike a sporting event, a degree of fearlessness is essential. The South Korean <a href=\"https://sopranosooyeonlee.com/about/\">Sooyeon Lee</a> \u2013 who appeared, like Kymach and Lei, in both finals \u2013 betrayed no nerves and much finesse, her gleaming soprano deployed with remarkable technique and breath control. She was naturally poised, with no histrionics even when for both her early and final round she offered mad scenes, from Donizetti\u2019s Lucia di Lammermoor and Bellini\u2019s La Sonnambula. Her coloratura in the latter was a huge crowdpleaser, but ultimately these high-wire vocal acrobatics didn\u2019t display enough variety.</p> <p><a href=\"http://guadalupebarrientos.com/about-me/\">Guad</a><a href=\"http://guadalupebarrientos.com/about-me/\">alupe Barrientos</a> from Argentina was a big mezzo voice with an effervescent personality to match and, had she sung Wagner again as in her early round, her place in the final as the wildcard entry might have been better justified.

      "bodyText": "The Ukrainian Andrei Kymach was just a babe in arms when Dmitri Hvorostovsky took the Cardiff Singer of the World title in 1989, but that his burnished baritone occasionally reminded one of that much-missed Russian only added to the conviction that Kymach was a most worthy winner this year. An aristocratic presence on stage, the integrity and focus of his musical and dramatic characterisation across the week of competition was compelling. Only the words mattered. Not that Kymach\u2019s win was a walkover. The Chinese tenor Mingjie Lei\u2019s charm and sincerity were obvious, his high tenor very even and surprisingly mellow. Winning his earlier round with easy accomplishment marked him as a future star, and his lieder singing won him the coveted song prize on Thursday. For those who make the final of both the song and main prize categories, with little time to recover between their four performances, the vocal stamina involved inevitably means traces of fatigue coming through by the end. And with the television coverage and attendant chat not unlike a sporting event, a degree of fearlessness is essential. The South Korean Sooyeon Lee \u2013 who appeared, like Kymach and Lei, in both finals \u2013 betrayed no nerves and much finesse, her gleaming soprano deployed with remarkable technique and breath control. She was naturally poised, with no histrionics even when for both her early and final round she offered mad scenes, from Donizetti\u2019s Lucia di Lammermoor and Bellini\u2019s La Sonnambula. Her coloratura in the latter was a huge crowdpleaser, but ultimately these high-wire vocal acrobatics didn\u2019t display enough variety. Guadalupe Barrientos from Argentina was a big mezzo voice with an effervescent personality to match and, had she sung Wagner again as in her early round, her place in the final as the wildcard entry might have been better justified. Her diction was less than clear and her choice of Elgar\u2019s Sabbath Morning at Sea from his Sea Pictures was brave, though probably misguided. The American Patrick Guetti was the only bass and the change of repertoire was welcome, yet less would have been more. Guetti\u2019s earliest progress was in musical theatre and, for all the panache of his delivery \u2013 Aaron Copland\u2019s I Bought Me a Cat very much a show-turn \u2013 the exaggerated mannerisms seemed better suited to that genre. While the Joan Sutherland audience prize, given this year in memory of Hvorostovsky, went to the English soprano Katie Bray, Kymach\u2019s success will see him in demand across the world \u2013 and rightly so.

In 2009 the American futurist <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/speakers/ray_kurzweil\" title=\"\">Ray Kurzweil</a>, another supplement enthusiast, coined a similar metaphor, referring instead to \u201cbridges to immortality\u201d.</p> <p><em><strong>Where to begin</strong></em> with the almighty question: why would anyone think this a good idea? Strole is openly afraid of death (who isn\u2019t? He argues), though he seems more motivated by a kind of curiosity. We live our lives knowing they will one day end. Imagine what we might accomplish if they didn\u2019t. (It is not clear exactly what Strole might actually want to accomplish: self-actualisation? World peace? That tricky jigsaw?)

(Is it possible the future will become a refuge for the rich, who experience life as a sequence of exquisite events and who might not understand the concept of entropy as relief or escape?) Few life extensionists openly admit to hedonistic impulses. \u201cYou can only smoke so many Cuban cigars,\u201d Asprey says, \u201cbefore you\u2019re like, \u2018I\u2019ve got to buckle down.\u2019\u201d Though when I asked the British gerontologist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/oct/06/race-to-kill-killer-zombie-cells-senescent-damaged-ageing-eliminate-research-mice-aubrey-de-grey\" title=\"\">Aubrey de Grey</a> why indefinite life appeals, he replied, half-joking: \u201cMy hot tub.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3c1e90e740d269996d4b406265dd3203c070551a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c1e90e740d269996d4b406265dd3203c070551a/3289_2168_3129_1878/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Keeping father time at bay: but why would we want to live to 180?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keeping father time at bay: but why would we want to live to 180?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Nate Kitch/Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>De Grey, a serious scientist, considers life extension a health issue, which is perhaps the field\u2019s most convincing argument. Gerontologists are not hoping to end death, he says. Instead, \u201cWe\u2019re interested in people not getting sick when they get old.\u201d No matter how much society rails against the concept of immortality, nobody really wants to suffer through Alzheimer\u2019s, or suddenly fall foul of cardiovascular disease. Gerontology is the act of developing treatments for age-related diseases, de Grey argues \u2013 of reducing the causes of death, not death itself. \u201cThe benefits of living longer are not the point,\u201d he says. \u201cThe benefits are not having Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u201d For de Grey, indefinite life is a by-product, not a goal.</p> <p>Are we anywhere near to a breakthrough? So far, research has produced modest yields. Gerontologists speak prophetically of potential, but most warn a significant human development remains somewhere far off in the distance \u2013 almost in sight but not quite. Richard Hodes, the director of the <a href=\"https://www.nia.nih.gov/\" title=\"\">National Institute of Ag</a><a href=\"https://www.nia.nih.gov/\" title=\"\">ing</a>, a US government agency, told me that, though research in animals has led to \u201cdramatic increases in lifespan\u201d, some of them multi-fold, \u201cThere has been far less quantitative effect as those models have moved towards mammalian species.\u201d The biologist Laura Deming, who in 2011 established the <a href=\"https://www.longevity.vc/\" title=\"\">Longevity Fund</a>, a venture capital firm that supports \u201chigh-potential longevity companies\u201d, told me that startups continue to successfully root out biological markers of ageing \u2013 inefficient cells, mitochondrial decline \u2013 but that, in humans, \u201cWe really don\u2019t know right now what will work and what won\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Much of gerontology focuses on identifying types of damage that accumulate with age and developing ways to halt or reverse that accumulation. It has been discovered, for example, that as we grow older, certain cells become ineffective but nevertheless stick around, getting in the way like comatose guests at the end of a house party. Removing those cells have helped mice have longer, healthier lifespans (this is called senescence.) Similar forms of genetic engineering have been successful in other animal models. But to reach the mainstream, gerontologists must convince government agencies to support human adoption, a complicated and long-winded task, given the general view that death is a normal human process. Why play God?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In any case, it is likely that one single longevity strategy alone won\u2019t help us much</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In any case, it is likely that one single longevity strategy alone won\u2019t help us much. Life extensionists enjoy a metaphor: humans are complicated machines, they say, like cars, but mushy. And what happens to a machine if you don\u2019t look after it? It rusts. It splutters and spurts, until it reaches its inevitable conclusion. De Grey considers ageing a \u201cmultifaceted problem\u201d. Humans incur many different types of damage. We don\u2019t just rust. We scratch. We dent. Rubbish accumulates in our footwells and grime develops in our engines. We require multiple strategies of repair \u2013 constant fine-tuning. What\u2019s the point in removing those senescent cells if that molecular junk continues to build up?</p> <p>De Grey shares Strole\u2019s belief that innovations are coming. But, unlike Strole, he considers current strategies almost pointless. He does not take hundreds of supplements. He does not pay for stem-cell transfusions. \u201cI want to wait and see,\u201d he says. At 56, he is content to sit tight for treatments that have become \u201cprogressively more effective\u2026 so I don\u2019t have to use clunky, first-generation therapies that may have side-effects.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>This does not</strong></em> seem to bother Strole, nor others in the community. Time is running out! Bring on the treatments! At <a href=\"https://www.raadfest.com/\" title=\"\">RAADfest</a>, the Coalition\u2019s annual conference \u2013 \u201cthe Woodstock of radical life extension\u201d \u2013 visitors are invited to root through the latest in anti-ageing products, of which there are many. Try DHEA PRO-25, an \u201canti-ageing hormone\u201d. Or NAD+PRO, advertised to \u201cboost physical and mental energy\u201d. Or Piracetam, from the family of \u201csmart drugs\u201d, or nootropics, which claim to enhance brain function. Strole named the area: \u201cThe marketplace of your future.\u201d It is popular among RAADfest guests for the power of its promise: the opportunity to realise the hoped-for self. This is Wellness 2.0 \u2013 beyond the cosmetic. We have been anti-ageing our skin for years. Why not our insides, too?</p> <p>Jim Mellon is reported to have described the longevity market as \u201ca fountain of cash\u201d, and has urged friends to invest. Business is already lucrative, but it is a market that appears to take little notice of efficacy. The majority of anti-ageing products remain unregulated \u2013 \u201cpatent pending\u201d, in the vernacular \u2013 and more than a few appear utterly useless. Earlier this year, the US government released a statement condemning the anti-ageing fad of transfusing young blood into older bodies, a practice researchers have proved effective in mice but which, the FDA said, \u201cshould not be assumed to be safe or effective\u201d in humans. (The treatments cost thousands of dollars, and led to concern that \u201cPatients are being preyed upon by unscrupulous actors.\u201d)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We have been anti-ageing our skin for years. Why not our insides, too?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A decade ago, the American Association of Medicine publicly condemned the sale of \u201canti-ageing hormones,\u201d an industry that was reported to be worth $50bn. \u201cDespite the widespread promotion of hormones as anti-ageing agents by for-profit websites,\u201d the association said, \u201cthe scientific evidence to support these claims is lacking.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>The oldest person</strong></em> to have lived, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jun/28/age-105-then-youve-a-better-chance-of-living-even-longer\" title=\"\">Jeanne Calment</a>, reached 122, though she was perhaps not the greatest example of good health: she smoked until she was 117. The most successful life-extension methods we know of seem to be those we have known all along: eat well, sleep well, exercise, reduce stress and rely on modern medicine, which has prolonged average lifespans significantly over the past 160 years.</p> <p>Strole does that and more. So far it\u2019s working, he says. He is 6ft 4 and 13st \u2013 \u201cthe perfect weight\u201d \u2013 with a slick of glossy grey hair. Perhaps his regimen is effective. Or, perhaps, like Calment, he has won a kind of genetic lottery, his healthy hair predisposed. It is difficult to say exactly, but, as of this moment, he will die. What happens if a breakthrough doesn\u2019t arrive in his lifetime? \u201cWell, then we\u2019re in a little bit of hot water,\u201d he says. But \u201cit\u2019s better to go for it than to not go for it. It\u2019s better than just settling in. Don\u2019t go quietly into the night.\u201d</p>",

Few life extensionists openly admit to hedonistic impulses. \u201cYou can only smoke so many Cuban cigars,\u201d Asprey says, \u201cbefore you\u2019re like, \u2018I\u2019ve got to buckle down.\u2019\u201d Though when I asked the British gerontologist Aubrey de Grey why indefinite life appeals, he replied, half-joking: \u201cMy hot tub.\u201d De Grey, a serious scientist, considers life extension a health issue, which is perhaps the field\u2019s most convincing argument. Gerontologists are not hoping to end death, he says. Instead, \u201cWe\u2019re interested in people not getting sick when they get old.\u201d No matter how much society rails against the concept of immortality, nobody really wants to suffer through Alzheimer\u2019s, or suddenly fall foul of cardiovascular disease. Gerontology is the act of developing treatments for age-related diseases, de Grey argues \u2013 of reducing the causes of death, not death itself. \u201cThe benefits of living longer are not the point,\u201d he says. \u201cThe benefits are not having Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u201d For de Grey, indefinite life is a by-product, not a goal. Are we anywhere near to a breakthrough? So far, research has produced modest yields. Gerontologists speak prophetically of potential, but most warn a significant human development remains somewhere far off in the distance \u2013 almost in sight but not quite. Richard Hodes, the director of the National Institute of Aging, a US government agency, told me that, though research in animals has led to \u201cdramatic increases in lifespan\u201d, some of them multi-fold, \u201cThere has been far less quantitative effect as those models have moved towards mammalian species.\u201d The biologist Laura Deming, who in 2011 established the Longevity Fund, a venture capital firm that supports \u201chigh-potential longevity companies\u201d, told me that startups continue to successfully root out biological markers of ageing \u2013 inefficient cells, mitochondrial decline \u2013 but that, in humans, \u201cWe really don\u2019t know right now what will work and what won\u2019t.\u201d Much of gerontology focuses on identifying types of damage that accumulate with age and developing ways to halt or reverse that accumulation. It has been discovered, for example, that as we grow older, certain cells become ineffective but nevertheless stick around, getting in the way like comatose guests at the end of a house party. Removing those cells have helped mice have longer, healthier lifespans (this is called senescence.) Similar forms of genetic engineering have been successful in other animal models. But to reach the mainstream, gerontologists must convince government agencies to support human adoption, a complicated and long-winded task, given the general view that death is a normal human process. Why play God? In any case, it is likely that one single longevity strategy alone won\u2019t help us much. Life extensionists enjoy a metaphor: humans are complicated machines, they say, like cars, but mushy. And what happens to a machine if you don\u2019t look after it? It rusts. It splutters and spurts, until it reaches its inevitable conclusion. De Grey considers ageing a \u201cmultifaceted problem\u201d. Humans incur many different types of damage. We don\u2019t just rust. We scratch. We dent. Rubbish accumulates in our footwells and grime develops in our engines. We require multiple strategies of repair \u2013 constant fine-tuning. What\u2019s the point in removing those senescent cells if that molecular junk continues to build up? De Grey shares Strole\u2019s belief that innovations are coming. But, unlike Strole, he considers current strategies almost pointless. He does not take hundreds of supplements. He does not pay for stem-cell transfusions. \u201cI want to wait and see,\u201d he says. At 56, he is content to sit tight for treatments that have become \u201cprogressively more effective\u2026 so I don\u2019t have to use clunky, first-generation therapies that may have side-effects.\u201d This does not seem to bother Strole, nor others in the community. Time is running out! Bring on the treatments! At RAADfest, the Coalition\u2019s annual conference \u2013 \u201cthe Woodstock of radical life extension\u201d \u2013 visitors are invited to root through the latest in anti-ageing products, of which there are many. Try DHEA PRO-25, an \u201canti-ageing hormone\u201d. Or NAD+PRO, advertised to \u201cboost physical and mental energy\u201d. Or Piracetam, from the family of \u201csmart drugs\u201d, or nootropics, which claim to enhance brain function. Strole named the area: \u201cThe marketplace of your future.\u201d It is popular among RAADfest guests for the power of its promise: the opportunity to realise the hoped-for self. This is Wellness 2.0 \u2013 beyond the cosmetic. We have been anti-ageing our skin for years. Why not our insides, too? Jim Mellon is reported to have described the longevity market as \u201ca fountain of cash\u201d, and has urged friends to invest. Business is already lucrative, but it is a market that appears to take little notice of efficacy. The majority of anti-ageing products remain unregulated \u2013 \u201cpatent pending\u201d, in the vernacular \u2013 and more than a few appear utterly useless. Earlier this year, the US government released a statement condemning the anti-ageing fad of transfusing young blood into older bodies, a practice researchers have proved effective in mice but which, the FDA said, \u201cshould not be assumed to be safe or effective\u201d in humans. (The treatments cost thousands of dollars, and led to concern that \u201cPatients are being preyed upon by unscrupulous actors.\u201d) A decade ago, the American Association of Medicine publicly condemned the sale of \u201canti-ageing hormones,\u201d an industry that was reported to be worth $50bn. \u201cDespite the widespread promotion of hormones as anti-ageing agents by for-profit websites,\u201d the association said, \u201cthe scientific evidence to support these claims is lacking.\u201d The oldest person to have lived, Jeanne Calment, reached 122, though she was perhaps not the greatest example of good health: she smoked until she was 117. The most successful life-extension methods we know of seem to be those we have known all along: eat well, sleep well, exercise, reduce stress and rely on modern medicine, which has prolonged average lifespans significantly over the past 160 years. Strole does that and more. So far it\u2019s working, he says. He is 6ft 4 and 13st \u2013 \u201cthe perfect weight\u201d \u2013 with a slick of glossy grey hair. Perhaps his regimen is effective. Or, perhaps, like Calment, he has won a kind of genetic lottery, his healthy hair predisposed. It is difficult to say exactly, but, as of this moment, he will die. What happens if a breakthrough doesn\u2019t arrive in his lifetime? \u201cWell, then we\u2019re in a little bit of hot water,\u201d he says. But \u201cit\u2019s better to go for it than to not go for it. It\u2019s better than just settling in. Don\u2019t go quietly into the night.\u201d",

In the latter case, parrots were discovered to be passing on deadly pathogens to their owners, spreading a disease that continued unchecked for months \u2013 because scientists had misidentified the agent involved. It was only when the real killer \u2013 a bacterium called Chlamydia psittaci \u2013 was identified that doctors were able to tackle the condition. In fact, only 33 people were killed by parrot fever in the US and even fewer in Europe \u2013 which somewhat strains Honigsbaum\u2019s definition of a pandemic. This is a small complaint, however. Honigsbaum has written a fascinating account of a deeply important topic \u2013 for if the past 100 years have taught us anything, it is that new diseases and viral strains will inevitably beset us, no matter how sophisticated science becomes. As Honigsbaum puts it: \u201cPestilences may be unpredictable but we should expect them to recur.\u201d \u2022 The Pandemic Century: One Hundred Years of Panic, Hysteria and Hubris by Mark Honigsbaum is published by C Hurst (\u00a320).

      "body": "<p>British theatre is in the process of a massive change. More far-reaching than any I have seen in more than 20 years as the <em>Observer\u2019s</em> drama critic. Accelerating. Overdue. Irrevocable. Welcome.</p> <p>There used to be a template for the artistic directors of theatres. A template about as restricted as candidates for the Tory party leadership. White and male. Obviously. This was so continuous with the default position for power in Britain that for ages it went unremarked. Not any more. At the press conference to announce his opening season as artistic director of the Donmar in April, Michael Longhurst was asked if, as a white man, he now found himself in a minority among new appointees. Yes, he said. \u201cQuite rightly.\u201d</p> <p>The shift from all-maleness has come in spurts, since the beginning of the 2000s, when Gemma Bodinetz took over at Liverpool, and Vicky Featherstone headed up the new National Theatre of Scotland. The end of the whitewashing of British theatre (or, rather, the beginning of the end) came later \u2013 but is moving more decisively. Last year was crucial: a series of appointments of people of colour reordered the alphabet of artistic directorships. From Justin Audibert to Matthew Xia.</p> <p>A look at London\u2019s Young Vic, where Kwame Kwei-Armah took over last year, demonstrates what a difference a new theatrical head can make. His task looked hard: his predecessor, David Lan, had run a superb theatre. But Kwei-Armah has already proved there is another kind of superb. His programming has been distinctive and bold, mashing up text with music (a carnival <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/oct/14/twelfth-night-young-vic-review-im-not-running-hare-height-of-the-storm-atkins-pryce-zeller\" title=\"\">Twelfth Night</a></em>) triumphantly casting black actors in parts previously considered the realm of white performers (<em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/may/19/death-of-a-salesman-young-vic-review-henry-iv-part-1-2-henry-v-shakespeares-globe\" title=\"\">Death of a Salesman</a></em>), putting on work that merges dance and installation art (<em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/may/27/bronx-gothic-okwui-okpokwasili-young-vic-london\" title=\"\">Bronx Gothic</a></em>). The atmosphere in the bar is galvanising. A couple of years ago, the actor Janet Suzman claimed that \u201ctheatre is a white invention, a European invention, and white people go to it\u201d. The Young Vic is a living refutation of this. As is <a href=\"https://www.stratfordeast.com/\" title=\"\">Stratford East</a>, a theatre reignited by the dynamism of its new artistic director, Nadia Fall. Fall says: \u201cDiversity is not our endgame. Our endgame has to be quality of work.\u201d So no plays about her \u201cstrict Asian\u201d upbringing \u2013 any more than Nicholas Hytner\u2019s National Theatre was heavy with dramas about being Jewish in Manchester. Rather, she has brought a buoyant internationalism \u2013 and a fresh emphasis on inventive design. Female designers have been in the vanguard of those remodelling the theatre and its workforce: Rosie Elnile and Joanna Scotcher have made Stratford glow.</p> <p>In bringing new looks, new sounds, new subjects to their theatres, the new directors will expand possibilities and audiences \u2013 especially if they keep an eye on ticket prices. In the interviews with the new artistic directors that follow, I was particularly struck by what HighTide\u2019s Suba Das says about reaching out to choreographers and tapping into love of standup. It is hard, though, to guess what changes will be wrought: if we knew what the next thing was it wouldn\u2019t be new. The encouraging thing is that as one barrier is tipped over it nudges the next. The Donmar\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/13/julius-caesar-donmar-warehouse-josie-rourke-kate-pakenham-harriet-walter-shakespeare-bbc-four\" title=\"\"> 2012 all-women Shakespeares</a> were a turning point. The publicity was about their femaleness but the productions were Trojan mares, shifting the norm: they featured more black, more brown, more short and more round bodies \u2013 and more non-RP accents. We saw talent of which the stage had been starved. We\u2019ll see more under these new bosses. Perhaps we\u2019ll even have many more people of colour as theatre critics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"59a476f91492ab29bdeb7393fe0dc7726e5b33e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59a476f91492ab29bdeb7393fe0dc7726e5b33e1/417_1542_416_519/401.jpg\" alt=\"Lynette Linton.\" width=\"401\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lynette Linton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Lynette Linton: \u2018Do you watch Netflix? If so, just come a bit further down the road\u2026\u2019<br>Bush theatre</h2> <p>Lynette Linton, 29, was born in Leytonstone, east London, and had early ambitions to be a screen actor. Theatre didn\u2019t appeal to her at first, but after joining the National Youth Theatre in her early 20s and receiving encouragement from director Rikki Beadle-Blair, she turned her attention to writing and directing for the stage. Sustained by a job at John Lewis \u2013 she worked in the Oxford Street food hall and edited the retailer\u2019s in-house magazine \u2013 Linton wrote her first play, <em>Step</em>, which was staged at Theatre Royal Stratford East in 2013. She went on to direct work for the Gate theatre and the Donmar, where her production of Lynn Nottage\u2019s <em>Sweat</em> garnered five-star reviews last December (it transferred to the West End earlier this month).</p> <p>The Bush theatre, in an \u201cincredibly multicultural\u201d area of west London, is renowned as a champion of new writing talent \u2013 it premiered early work by writers such as Stephen Poliakoff and Conor McPherson \u2013 and as a magnet for diverse audiences. Taking over as artistic director from Madani Younis, who is now at the Southbank Centre, Linton is determined to connect with local communities and open up the building even more to younger audiences and creators. \u201cWhen I was 15, I wasn\u2019t a theatre person,\u201d she says, \u201cso what can I do to make sure 15-year-olds now feel like they are theatre people?\u201d</p> <p><strong>What three words sum up your theatre?</strong><br>Bold, fresh and west-London (we can pretend that\u2019s one word).</p> <p><strong>Sell theatre to someone who says they\u2019re not the theatre-going type\u2026</strong><br>Do you watch Netflix? Do you go to the cinema? If so, just come a little bit further down the road and see a story live. Because it\u2019s all storytelling. And the liveness of theatre is so exciting.</p> <p><strong>What single thing would improve British theatre?</strong><br>Understanding that community work and \u201cprofessional\u201d work on the stage are the same thing. The community should be feeding the work on the stage, and vice versa. I always have an open rehearsal room. I invite young people to sit in and learn and be part of it and give their opinions. Who are you making it for otherwise?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dd72cbad68a135e22fa75384585e68f59e2beafe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd72cbad68a135e22fa75384585e68f59e2beafe/0_969_4000_5000/800.jpg\" alt=\"Stuart McQuarrie and Martha Plimpton in Sweat at the Donmar Warehouse, directed by Lynette Linton.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stuart McQuarrie and Martha Plimpton in Sweat at the Donmar Warehouse, directed by Lynette Linton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Persson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What show have you seen recently that really made an impact on you?</strong><br><em>My White Best Friend</em> at the Bunker. It was reacting to events happening that week, and it made me think a lot about theatre\u2019s responsibility to respond to current events.</p> <p><strong>Who or what first got you into theatre?</strong><br>Rikki Beadle-Blair [artistic director of <a href=\"http://teamangelica.com/\" title=\"\">Team Angelica</a>]. I met him through the National Youth Theatre and then came to see one of his plays at Theatre Royal Stratford East. I remember sitting in the box office, feeling a little out of place, and he came over, gave me a hug and a free ticket. I went and watched some of the rehearsed readings he had on in the Angelic Tales season, and that\u2019s when I went \u201cWow\u201d. I remember coming out of the theatre and standing at the bus stop for half an hour going, \u201cThat was really special\u201d. It spiralled from there. I always wonder, would I have found my way into theatre if he hadn\u2019t done that? That fuels my work now.</p> <p><strong>Best production you</strong><strong>\u2019ve s</strong><strong>een and why?</strong><br>I\u2019ve followed Arinz\u00e9 Kene\u2019s career for a long time. I remember seeing <em>God\u2019s Property</em> at Soho theatre and really falling in love with it. Watching his progression to [his latest play] <em>Misty</em> has been inspiring, but seeing <em>God\u2019s Property</em> probably changed my life.</p> <p><strong>What can\u2019t you live without at work?</strong><br>Yorkshire teabags. That was the first thing I changed at the Bush \u2013 they had PG Tips and I was like, \u201cWhat is this?!\u201d I have five cups a day; if I\u2019m in rehearsal it\u2019s worse. My tea is very specific. It\u2019s no sugar, incredibly strong, maybe two drops of milk. You have to put the milk in before taking the teabag out, otherwise it loses its taste. That\u2019s very important.</p> <p><strong>What books are on your bedside table?</strong><br>I have just reread <em>Small Island</em> by Andrea Levy, and I\u2019m about to start <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/20/natives-akala-review-destroying-myths-of-race-afia-hirsch\" title=\"\">Natives by Akala</a></em>. I saw the production of Small Island at the Olivier and I love Andrea Levy\u2019s writing, so I wanted to spend some more time with the book.</p> <p><em><strong>Hamilton</strong></em><strong> or </strong><em><strong>Hamlet</strong></em><strong>?</strong><br><em>Hamilton</em>. It\u2019s one of the best things in years. It\u2019s stunning.</p> <p><strong>Who would be your dream </strong><strong>person to work with</strong><strong> \u2013 dead or alive</strong><strong>?</strong><br>James Baldwin. He is one of my biggest inspirations and I remember reading his books at university, <em>Giovanni\u2019s Room</em> and <em>Another Country </em>specifically. He made me see the world differently.</p> <p><strong>What </strong><strong>should we come and see at your theatre?</strong><br><em><a href=\"https://www.bushtheatre.co.uk/event/strange-fruit/\" title=\"\">Strange Fruit </a></em><a href=\"https://www.bushtheatre.co.uk/event/strange-fruit/\" title=\"\">by Caryl Phillips</a> (until 27 July). It\u2019s part of our Passing the Baton scheme, where we revive a work by an artist of colour that should be seen. It\u2019s going to be a phenomenal show. <strong>KF</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c682fc71a53f1bb62af02326d524672c0559c7d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c682fc71a53f1bb62af02326d524672c0559c7d0/2145_1164_362_453/362.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Longhurst.\" width=\"362\" height=\"453\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Longhurst.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Michael Longhurst: \u2018It mainlines a hit of the human condition like no other art form\u2019<br>Donmar Warehouse</h2> <p>It is quite possibly the most coveted job in British theatre: running London\u2019s Donmar Warehouse, the boutique Covent Garden theatre that consistently punches above its weight. Following in the footsteps of Sam Mendes, Michael Grandage and Josie Rourke, Michael Longhurst has a huge task ahead of him but the 38-year-old seems unfazed.</p> <p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re off!!!! C\u2019mon down,\u201d he tweeted as he launched his first season in early April under the banner \u201cimportant stories thrillingly told\u201d and with an air of getting straight down to business.</p> <p>Born in Bromley in 1981, Longhurst studied philosophy at Nottingham University before training as a theatre director at Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts in London. He made his name with Nick Payne\u2019s <em>Constellations</em>, which transferred from the Royal Court to the West End in 2012. Since then his hits have included <em>Amadeus</em> at the National Theatre, <em>They Drink It in the Congo</em> at the Almeida and <em>Caroline, </em><em>Or Change</em> at the Chichester festival theatre, then in the West End.</p> <p>His mission is \u201cabout making sure the most relevant and important stories are hitting our stage\u201d, he says. \u201cWe have programmed lots of new writing and revivals that resonate with where the world is at the moment.\u201d They kicked off last week with David Greig\u2019s prophetic <em>Europe</em>, which explores our complex relationship to the continent. \u201cIt\u2019s the 25-year anniversary of the play and it reads like it was written yesterday,\u201d Longhurst says.</p> <p><strong>What three words sum up your theatre?</strong><br>Tiny magical warehouse. It\u2019s a miraculous space \u2013 251 seats in the heart of Covent Garden, and the intimacy just makes for this incredible live experience. It\u2019s always described as an actors\u2019 church because you can see the whites of the eyes and the beads of sweat, and that makes for an electric connection.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05fa9c1a8b265164dd9ba9516e74f8dad732a418\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05fa9c1a8b265164dd9ba9516e74f8dad732a418/371_0_2211_2212/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sharon D Clarke in Caroline, Or Change at the Playhouse, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sharon D Clarke in Caroline, Or Change at the Playhouse, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alastair Muir</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>How would you describe your current audience and what will you do to attract new audiences?</strong><br>The current audience is very loyal and generous and they are up for an eclectic mix of work. In terms of new audiences, we will be continuing the Young+Free scheme, giving free tickets to people under 25, and we\u2019re introducing Donmar Daily Release, which means holding back tickets so that 40 can be released every day for a show one week away. This allows people who can\u2019t book in advance to get access to tickets.</p> <p><strong>How would you sell theatre to someone who says they are not the theatre-going type</strong><strong>?</strong><br>I would say that theatre mainlines a hit of the human condition like no other art form. It is the best way to receive a story today. The days of wobbly french windows and French farces are behind us. Theatre is in a time when it is using its form boldly to tell really exciting stories, and there is nothing like the live event of it.</p> <p><strong>Is British theatre for all?</strong><br>Historically, it hasn\u2019t been. I think it is waking up fast and that has to do with artists and directors being accountable for who is represented on our stages and who gets to make and tell those stories.</p> <p><strong>What single thing would improve British </strong><strong>theatre?</strong><br>More government subsidy. The return for the economy has been proven. The Donmar receives a 7% subsidy, a very small amount, which is why our fundraising department is so important. Lots of our income comes from philanthropy and sponsorship.</p> <p><strong>What show have you seen recently that really made an impact on you?</strong><br><em>Death of a Salesman</em> at the Young Vic left me weeping. Wendell Pierce and Sharon D Clarke were amazing. It\u2019s an astonishing play about the hope that parents have in their children and the desire to please parents that children have. That shifting axis of expectation is heartbreaking and the African American lens that Marianne Elliott\u2019s production put on it made me see the play afresh.</p> <p><strong>Who or what first got you into the theatre?</strong><br>I loved panto as a child. Later, it was my English teacher, Mrs Withers, and my drama teacher, Tom Band, at St John Rigby school in Bromley who ignited my passion. It\u2019s devastating that arts subjects are falling off the curriculum.</p> <p><strong>Do you have a mentor or role model?</strong><br>Dominic Cooke has always been a guiding hand and light for me. He gave me big breaks early on in my career at the Royal Court and sage advice on making art and, now, running companies.</p> <p><strong>What are the top three personal skills that you need as an artistic director?</strong><br>Stamina, stamina, stamina. As a freelance director I could obsessively enter the bubble of making a show. At this moment, when I am in rehearsals the building still needs attention and support and funding. Those things don\u2019t go away while you actually make the art.</p> <p><strong>Favourite art form </strong><strong>other than theatre?</strong><br>Impossible to answer. But I do love an art gallery. I think plays are kinetic sculptures. I love the design process of the shows: it\u2019s fascinating and magical to me.</p> <p><em><strong>Hamilton</strong></em><strong> or </strong><em><strong>Hamlet</strong></em><strong>?</strong><br>I\u2019d like to direct both.</p> <p><strong>Who would be your dream actor to work with?</strong><br>There are so many actors I have as crushes it is hard to name just one, but Billie Piper, Olivia Colman, Riz Ahmed \u2013 call me. <strong>LO\u2019K</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"59a476f91492ab29bdeb7393fe0dc7726e5b33e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59a476f91492ab29bdeb7393fe0dc7726e5b33e1/2506_840_331_414/331.jpg\" alt=\"Suba Das.\" width=\"331\" height=\"414\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Suba Das.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Suba Das: \u2018We need to see that diversity actually makes great business sense\u2019<br>HighTide </h2> <p>Suba Das was born in 1984 on a council estate in North Shields, near Newcastle, the son of immigrants from rural India. Twice a week his father, a restaurant worker, would take Das and his twin, Deba, to the library, instilling in the brothers a love of learning that helped propel them to scholarships at Newcastle Royal grammar school and then to Cambridge University. After a postgraduate directing course at Birkbeck College, London, Das started out as assistant director at the Theatre Royal Stratford East, going on to direct at Nottingham Playhouse and the Young Vic, among other venues. Most recently, he was associate director at Curve Leicester, where he oversaw the development of new work. His credits at Curve included <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/apr/17/wipers-review-victoria-cross-khudadad-khan\" title=\"\">Wipers</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/apr/17/wipers-review-victoria-cross-khudadad-khan\" title=\"\"> by Ishy Din</a> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/06/pink-sari-revolution-review-sampat-pal-curve-leicester\" title=\"\">Pink Sari Revolution</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/oct/06/pink-sari-revolution-review-sampat-pal-curve-leicester\" title=\"\"> by Purva Naresh</a>.</p> <p>Das made his opera debut in 2017, directing the world premiere of Ravi Shankar\u2019s <em>Sukanya</em> for the Royal Opera. This spring he joined HighTide, the Suffolk-based theatre company and charity dedicated to discovering and launching new playwrights, which produces festivals in Aldeburgh, Edinburgh and, from 2021, also in Lowestoft. His first major challenge was Waltham Forest council unexpectedly withdrawing its funding for this summer\u2019s HighTide festival in Walthamstow, which meant it had to be cancelled. \u201cIt was disappointing but, in truth, a sign of the times,\u201d Das says. \u201cWe can no longer rely on traditional sources of funding like local authorities. We need to look for new ways to raise money and new ways of reaching diverse audiences.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Why is new writing important?</strong><br>We look to art to help us understand ourselves and our world, and new, normally unheard and marginalised voices enable us to look at life from unexpected angles. We are in tumultuous times where we are having to ask ourselves who we are as a society and who we are as people. Theatre needs to be part of that. I\u2019m interested in developing not only new playwrights but spoken word artists, choreographers and physical theatre-makers, too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72bd2927d00bc798625ac44515406c9b23e31e9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72bd2927d00bc798625ac44515406c9b23e31e9d/45_0_6659_3996/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ravi Shankar\u2019s Sukanya for the Royal Opera at Curve, Leicester.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ravi Shankar\u2019s Sukanya for the Royal Opera at Curve, Leicester, directed by Suba Das.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robbie Jack - Corbis/Corbis via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What single thing would improve British theatre?</strong><br>An understanding that diversity, a word that gets chucked around in an affirmative-action kind of way, actually makes great business sense. The more different types of people you can attract the better.</p> <p><strong>What are the top three</strong><strong> skills you need as an artistic director?</strong><br>Generosity, because leadership is about what you are comfortable giving away. Flexibility, because, Lord knows, your diary will change on a day-to-day basis. And fiscal prudence.</p> <p><strong>What show have you seen recently that really made an impact on you?</strong><br><em>Emilia</em> by Morgan Lloyd Malcolm. I hope it will come back and tour. That show [a feminist call to arms with a diverse, all-female cast] needs to be in schools, in youth clubs, student productions \u2013 wherever it can reach young people, especially girls.</p> <p><strong>What books are on your bedside table?</strong><br><em>Playwriting</em> by the late, great dramatist Stephen Jeffreys, which is the most astonishing analysis of the craft ever. He was a genius on structure and character, the nuts and bolts of it, the practical as well as the ethereal. And <em>Beloved </em>by Toni Morrison, the most important book I have read.</p> <p><strong>How would you sell theatre to someone who says they are not the theatre-going type?</strong><br>I would say that if you love going to standup comedy, you love going clubbing, you love going to cabaret and you love going to a gig then, actually, you love theatre. <strong>LO\u2019K</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"28b9f95179b78fadcf6c75fc898fde188bc98942\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28b9f95179b78fadcf6c75fc898fde188bc98942/1030_1413_833_500/500.jpg\" alt=\"Charlotte Bennett (left) and Katie Posner.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlotte Bennett (left) and Katie Posner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Charlotte Bennett &amp; Katie Posner: \u2018If you\u2019ve had a terrible day but can still laugh, then it\u2019s OK\u2019<br>Paines Plough</h2> <p>Charlotte Bennett and Katie Posner, who take over as joint artistic directors at the London touring theatre company Paines Plough in August, met while directing separate plays at York Theatre Royal 10 years ago. Bennett, who grew up in Leeds, had just started her own company, Forward Theatre Project, while Posner, a Londoner, was working for York\u2019s Pilot theatre. \u201cOver time, we became artistic mentors to each other,\u201d says Bennett. \u201cAnd because we were both working with touring companies, we had lots of big chats about the joys and difficulties of that.\u201d</p> <p>A decade on, with Bennett heading up the new writing department at Soho theatre, and Posner directing shows around the country on a freelance basis, both women had their eye on the top job at Paines Plough. When it came up, they decided to pool their strengths rather than compete.</p> <p>Their mission at the 45-year-old company, which focuses entirely on new writing and has worked with writers such as Sarah Kane, Mark Ravenhill, Enda Walsh, Abi Morgan and Mike Bartlett, will be \u201cchampioning the unheard and reaching the overlooked\u201d, according to Bennett. Posner adds: \u201cIt\u2019s about finding exciting artists who wouldn\u2019t necessarily define themselves as playwrights, and telling stories in unique and brilliant ways to make the industry wake up.\u201d</p> <p><strong>What three words sum up your theatre?</strong><br><strong>KP </strong>Everywhere, unafraid, immediate.</p> <p><strong>What is your current audience like</strong><strong> and how will you attract new </strong><strong>ones?</strong><br><strong>CB </strong>Our audience is shape-shifting. Roundabout [the company\u2019s pop-up auditorium] starts in Edinburgh at the fringe and goes on to places like Poole, Salford and Doncaster, so the audience changes with each place.

There\u2019s no room for ego or pretension, and there\u2019s a real honesty in geordie audiences. Before Margaret Thatcher died, I did a show that contained a quote from her last day in office, saying: \u201cI feel very happy that I\u2019m leaving the country in a better state.\u201d Every night, the audience shouted back: \u201cFuck off!\u201d It was amazing.</p> <p><strong>What show have you seen recently that really made an impact on you?</strong><br><strong>KP </strong>It\u2019s the same for both of us: <em>Misty</em> at the Bush theatre. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/apr/27/arinze-kene-interview-misty-death-of-a-salesman\" title=\"\">Arinz\u00e9 Kene</a> is incredible. Walking into that space and having a visceral reaction to something that grappled with form in an innovative way, it blew our minds.</p> <p><strong>Who or what first got you into theatre?</strong><br><strong>CB </strong>My older sister [Helen Bradley, now deputy head of development at Guildhall School of Music and Drama]. She was my role model and still is. After she went to Hull and did a drama degree, I went to Hull and did a drama degree. When she worked at the Royal Court and posted me plays, I duly directed them. That\u2019s where I found my love of new writing.</p> <p><strong>KP </strong>The first play I ever fell in love with was Jim Cartwright\u2019s <em>Road</em>.

It will stay with me for ever.</p> <p><strong>KP</strong> <em>Girl from the North Country</em> [by Conor McPherson at the Old Vic]. It was really messy and played around with language in a way that I would probably have been scared to do. It triggered a realisation that, actually, life is messy, and it\u2019s great to see that on stage.</p> <p><strong>What can\u2019t you live without at work?</strong><br><strong>KP </strong>Laughter.

It also means he is deeply aware of the importance of the Rep and its 1971 building in the cultural life of the city and the nation. \u201cIt\u2019s a historic theatre, the first in the UK to be based in its own building,\u201d he says. \u201cPre-National Theatre, it was the place Olivier wanted to go and be seen; he trained here along with John Gielgud, Ralph Richardson, Peggy Ashcroft, Paul Scofield \u2013 that\u2019s quite some heritage.\u201d</p> <p>Foley made his name as a writer, comedian and actor before turning to directing. He co-founded the Right Size with Hamish McColl, and their stage shows <em>The Play What I Wrote</em> and <em>Do You Come Here Often?</em> became long-running West End and Broadway hits. Other directing credits include <em>Jeeves and Wooster in Perfect Nonsense</em>, which won an Olivier award in 2014, <em>The </em><em>Ladykillers</em>, <em>Ducktastic</em><em> </em>and the unloved <em>X Factor</em> musical <em>I Can\u2019t Sing!</em>. He also directed the 2016 comedy film <em>Mindhorn</em>.</p> <p>His predecessor at the Rep, Roxana Silbert (now at Hampstead theatre), left the company in a strong position, having won praise for her promotion of diversity, championing of accessibility and continued nurturing of new writing. Stepping into her shoes is \u201ca massive challenge\u201d, says Foley.</p> <p><strong>What is your current audience like and </strong><strong>how will you </strong><strong>attract new </strong><strong>ones?</strong><br>They are Brummies, so they\u2019ll be smart, self-deprecating and surprisingly sophisticated. Birmingham people have an amazing dry sense of humour; they\u2019re very generous, too. Birmingham has the most youthful demographic in the UK and is actually the most diverse city, eclipsing even London. Yet, essentially, theatre is still a middle-class sport. It\u2019s less well-funded than it used to be, but there\u2019s nonetheless a lot of public money going into theatre, and the end results are only reaching a very small proportion of people. So that should change. And changing it is really about making shows that can appeal to a wide demographic and genuinely engage the local population by doing what theatre has done since time immemorial: telling stories that people can relate to in an exciting way.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6fb7eb8287a4662a577efddd55c29363dfc48927\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fb7eb8287a4662a577efddd55c29363dfc48927/0_282_1507_1883/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sean Foley and Hamish McColl in The Play What I Wrote at Wyndham\u2019s theatre.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sean Foley and Hamish McColl in The Play What I Wrote at Wyndham\u2019s theatre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Which theatre in Britain or the rest of the world do you like going to</strong><strong>?</strong><br>I really enjoyed St Ann\u2019s Warehouse in Brooklyn, recently.

It was incredibly moving.</p> <p><strong>Who or what got you into theatre?</strong><br>When I was at Oxford University in the mid-80s, I could not get on with any of the drama societies, so I ended up joining the Oxford Youth Theatre. The people who were running it happened to know this bunch of crazy cats who had just come back from a theatre school in Paris and set up their own company with an extremely pretentious name: Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Complicit\u00e9. To get free rehearsal space they were giving workshops. I went to a couple and thought, Ah\u2011ha, this is different.</p> <p><strong>Do you have a mentor or a role model?</strong><br>Kenneth Branagh has been a massive influence.

      "bodyText": "British theatre is in the process of a massive change. More far-reaching than any I have seen in more than 20 years as the Observer\u2019s drama critic. Accelerating. Overdue. Irrevocable. Welcome. There used to be a template for the artistic directors of theatres. A template about as restricted as candidates for the Tory party leadership. White and male. Obviously. This was so continuous with the default position for power in Britain that for ages it went unremarked. Not any more. At the press conference to announce his opening season as artistic director of the Donmar in April, Michael Longhurst was asked if, as a white man, he now found himself in a minority among new appointees. Yes, he said. \u201cQuite rightly.\u201d The shift from all-maleness has come in spurts, since the beginning of the 2000s, when Gemma Bodinetz took over at Liverpool, and Vicky Featherstone headed up the new National Theatre of Scotland. The end of the whitewashing of British theatre (or, rather, the beginning of the end) came later \u2013 but is moving more decisively. Last year was crucial: a series of appointments of people of colour reordered the alphabet of artistic directorships. From Justin Audibert to Matthew Xia. A look at London\u2019s Young Vic, where Kwame Kwei-Armah took over last year, demonstrates what a difference a new theatrical head can make. His task looked hard: his predecessor, David Lan, had run a superb theatre. But Kwei-Armah has already proved there is another kind of superb. His programming has been distinctive and bold, mashing up text with music (a carnival Twelfth Night) triumphantly casting black actors in parts previously considered the realm of white performers (Death of a Salesman), putting on work that merges dance and installation art (Bronx Gothic). The atmosphere in the bar is galvanising. A couple of years ago, the actor Janet Suzman claimed that \u201ctheatre is a white invention, a European invention, and white people go to it\u201d. The Young Vic is a living refutation of this. As is Stratford East, a theatre reignited by the dynamism of its new artistic director, Nadia Fall. Fall says: \u201cDiversity is not our endgame. Our endgame has to be quality of work.\u201d So no plays about her \u201cstrict Asian\u201d upbringing \u2013 any more than Nicholas Hytner\u2019s National Theatre was heavy with dramas about being Jewish in Manchester. Rather, she has brought a buoyant internationalism \u2013 and a fresh emphasis on inventive design. Female designers have been in the vanguard of those remodelling the theatre and its workforce: Rosie Elnile and Joanna Scotcher have made Stratford glow. In bringing new looks, new sounds, new subjects to their theatres, the new directors will expand possibilities and audiences \u2013 especially if they keep an eye on ticket prices. In the interviews with the new artistic directors that follow, I was particularly struck by what HighTide\u2019s Suba Das says about reaching out to choreographers and tapping into love of standup. It is hard, though, to guess what changes will be wrought: if we knew what the next thing was it wouldn\u2019t be new. The encouraging thing is that as one barrier is tipped over it nudges the next. The Donmar\u2019s 2012 all-women Shakespeares were a turning point. The publicity was about their femaleness but the productions were Trojan mares, shifting the norm: they featured more black, more brown, more short and more round bodies \u2013 and more non-RP accents. We saw talent of which the stage had been starved. We\u2019ll see more under these new bosses. Perhaps we\u2019ll even have many more people of colour as theatre critics. Lynette Linton: \u2018Do you watch Netflix? If so, just come a bit further down the road\u2026\u2019 Bush theatre Lynette Linton, 29, was born in Leytonstone, east London, and had early ambitions to be a screen actor. Theatre didn\u2019t appeal to her at first, but after joining the National Youth Theatre in her early 20s and receiving encouragement from director Rikki Beadle-Blair, she turned her attention to writing and directing for the stage. Sustained by a job at John Lewis \u2013 she worked in the Oxford Street food hall and edited the retailer\u2019s in-house magazine \u2013 Linton wrote her first play, Step, which was staged at Theatre Royal Stratford East in 2013. She went on to direct work for the Gate theatre and the Donmar, where her production of Lynn Nottage\u2019s Sweat garnered five-star reviews last December (it transferred to the West End earlier this month). The Bush theatre, in an \u201cincredibly multicultural\u201d area of west London, is renowned as a champion of new writing talent \u2013 it premiered early work by writers such as Stephen Poliakoff and Conor McPherson \u2013 and as a magnet for diverse audiences. Taking over as artistic director from Madani Younis, who is now at the Southbank Centre, Linton is determined to connect with local communities and open up the building even more to younger audiences and creators. \u201cWhen I was 15, I wasn\u2019t a theatre person,\u201d she says, \u201cso what can I do to make sure 15-year-olds now feel like they are theatre people?\u201d What three words sum up your theatre? Bold, fresh and west-London (we can pretend that\u2019s one word). Sell theatre to someone who says they\u2019re not the theatre-going type\u2026 Do you watch Netflix? Do you go to the cinema? If so, just come a little bit further down the road and see a story live. Because it\u2019s all storytelling. And the liveness of theatre is so exciting. What single thing would improve British theatre? Understanding that community work and \u201cprofessional\u201d work on the stage are the same thing. The community should be feeding the work on the stage, and vice versa. I always have an open rehearsal room. I invite young people to sit in and learn and be part of it and give their opinions. Who are you making it for otherwise? What show have you seen recently that really made an impact on you? My White Best Friend at the Bunker. It was reacting to events happening that week, and it made me think a lot about theatre\u2019s responsibility to respond to current events. Who or what first got you into theatre? Rikki Beadle-Blair [artistic director of Team Angelica]. I met him through the National Youth Theatre and then came to see one of his plays at Theatre Royal Stratford East. I remember sitting in the box office, feeling a little out of place, and he came over, gave me a hug and a free ticket. I went and watched some of the rehearsed readings he had on in the Angelic Tales season, and that\u2019s when I went \u201cWow\u201d. I remember coming out of the theatre and standing at the bus stop for half an hour going, \u201cThat was really special\u201d. It spiralled from there. I always wonder, would I have found my way into theatre if he hadn\u2019t done that? That fuels my work now. Best production you\u2019ve seen and why? I\u2019ve followed Arinz\u00e9 Kene\u2019s career for a long time. I remember seeing God\u2019s Property at Soho theatre and really falling in love with it. Watching his progression to [his latest play] Misty has been inspiring, but seeing God\u2019s Property probably changed my life. What can\u2019t you live without at work? Yorkshire teabags. That was the first thing I changed at the Bush \u2013 they had PG Tips and I was like, \u201cWhat is this?!\u201d I have five cups a day; if I\u2019m in rehearsal it\u2019s worse. My tea is very specific. It\u2019s no sugar, incredibly strong, maybe two drops of milk. You have to put the milk in before taking the teabag out, otherwise it loses its taste. That\u2019s very important. What books are on your bedside table? I have just reread Small Island by Andrea Levy, and I\u2019m about to start Natives by Akala. I saw the production of Small Island at the Olivier and I love Andrea Levy\u2019s writing, so I wanted to spend some more time with the book. Hamilton or Hamlet? Hamilton. It\u2019s one of the best things in years. It\u2019s stunning. Who would be your dream person to work with \u2013 dead or alive? James Baldwin. He is one of my biggest inspirations and I remember reading his books at university, Giovanni\u2019s Room and Another Country specifically. He made me see the world differently. What should we come and see at your theatre? Strange Fruit by Caryl Phillips (until 27 July). It\u2019s part of our Passing the Baton scheme, where we revive a work by an artist of colour that should be seen. It\u2019s going to be a phenomenal show. KF Michael Longhurst: \u2018It mainlines a hit of the human condition like no other art form\u2019 Donmar Warehouse It is quite possibly the most coveted job in British theatre: running London\u2019s Donmar Warehouse, the boutique Covent Garden theatre that consistently punches above its weight. Following in the footsteps of Sam Mendes, Michael Grandage and Josie Rourke, Michael Longhurst has a huge task ahead of him but the 38-year-old seems unfazed. \u201cAnd we\u2019re off!!!! C\u2019mon down,\u201d he tweeted as he launched his first season in early April under the banner \u201cimportant stories thrillingly told\u201d and with an air of getting straight down to business. Born in Bromley in 1981, Longhurst studied philosophy at Nottingham University before training as a theatre director at Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts in London. He made his name with Nick Payne\u2019s Constellations, which transferred from the Royal Court to the West End in 2012. Since then his hits have included Amadeus at the National Theatre, They Drink It in the Congo at the Almeida and Caroline, Or Change at the Chichester festival theatre, then in the West End. His mission is \u201cabout making sure the most relevant and important stories are hitting our stage\u201d, he says. \u201cWe have programmed lots of new writing and revivals that resonate with where the world is at the moment.\u201d They kicked off last week with David Greig\u2019s prophetic Europe, which explores our complex relationship to the continent. \u201cIt\u2019s the 25-year anniversary of the play and it reads like it was written yesterday,\u201d Longhurst says. What three words sum up your theatre? Tiny magical warehouse. It\u2019s a miraculous space \u2013 251 seats in the heart of Covent Garden, and the intimacy just makes for this incredible live experience. It\u2019s always described as an actors\u2019 church because you can see the whites of the eyes and the beads of sweat, and that makes for an electric connection. How would you describe your current audience and what will you do to attract new audiences? The current audience is very loyal and generous and they are up for an eclectic mix of work. In terms of new audiences, we will be continuing the Young+Free scheme, giving free tickets to people under 25, and we\u2019re introducing Donmar Daily Release, which means holding back tickets so that 40 can be released every day for a show one week away. This allows people who can\u2019t book in advance to get access to tickets. How would you sell theatre to someone who says they are not the theatre-going type? I would say that theatre mainlines a hit of the human condition like no other art form. It is the best way to receive a story today. The days of wobbly french windows and French farces are behind us. Theatre is in a time when it is using its form boldly to tell really exciting stories, and there is nothing like the live event of it. Is British theatre for all? Historically, it hasn\u2019t been. I think it is waking up fast and that has to do with artists and directors being accountable for who is represented on our stages and who gets to make and tell those stories. What single thing would improve British theatre? More government subsidy. The return for the economy has been proven. The Donmar receives a 7% subsidy, a very small amount, which is why our fundraising department is so important. Lots of our income comes from philanthropy and sponsorship. What show have you seen recently that really made an impact on you? Death of a Salesman at the Young Vic left me weeping. Wendell Pierce and Sharon D Clarke were amazing. It\u2019s an astonishing play about the hope that parents have in their children and the desire to please parents that children have. That shifting axis of expectation is heartbreaking and the African American lens that Marianne Elliott\u2019s production put on it made me see the play afresh. Who or what first got you into the theatre? I loved panto as a child. Later, it was my English teacher, Mrs Withers, and my drama teacher, Tom Band, at St John Rigby school in Bromley who ignited my passion. It\u2019s devastating that arts subjects are falling off the curriculum. Do you have a mentor or role model? Dominic Cooke has always been a guiding hand and light for me. He gave me big breaks early on in my career at the Royal Court and sage advice on making art and, now, running companies. What are the top three personal skills that you need as an artistic director? Stamina, stamina, stamina. As a freelance director I could obsessively enter the bubble of making a show. At this moment, when I am in rehearsals the building still needs attention and support and funding. Those things don\u2019t go away while you actually make the art. Favourite art form other than theatre? Impossible to answer. But I do love an art gallery. I think plays are kinetic sculptures. I love the design process of the shows: it\u2019s fascinating and magical to me. Hamilton or Hamlet? I\u2019d like to direct both. Who would be your dream actor to work with? There are so many actors I have as crushes it is hard to name just one, but Billie Piper, Olivia Colman, Riz Ahmed \u2013 call me. LO\u2019K Suba Das: \u2018We need to see that diversity actually makes great business sense\u2019 HighTide Suba Das was born in 1984 on a council estate in North Shields, near Newcastle, the son of immigrants from rural India. Twice a week his father, a restaurant worker, would take Das and his twin, Deba, to the library, instilling in the brothers a love of learning that helped propel them to scholarships at Newcastle Royal grammar school and then to Cambridge University. After a postgraduate directing course at Birkbeck College, London, Das started out as assistant director at the Theatre Royal Stratford East, going on to direct at Nottingham Playhouse and the Young Vic, among other venues. Most recently, he was associate director at Curve Leicester, where he oversaw the development of new work. His credits at Curve included Wipers by Ishy Din and Pink Sari Revolution by Purva Naresh. Das made his opera debut in 2017, directing the world premiere of Ravi Shankar\u2019s Sukanya for the Royal Opera. This spring he joined HighTide, the Suffolk-based theatre company and charity dedicated to discovering and launching new playwrights, which produces festivals in Aldeburgh, Edinburgh and, from 2021, also in Lowestoft. His first major challenge was Waltham Forest council unexpectedly withdrawing its funding for this summer\u2019s HighTide festival in Walthamstow, which meant it had to be cancelled. \u201cIt was disappointing but, in truth, a sign of the times,\u201d Das says. \u201cWe can no longer rely on traditional sources of funding like local authorities. We need to look for new ways to raise money and new ways of reaching diverse audiences.\u201d Why is new writing important? We look to art to help us understand ourselves and our world, and new, normally unheard and marginalised voices enable us to look at life from unexpected angles. We are in tumultuous times where we are having to ask ourselves who we are as a society and who we are as people. Theatre needs to be part of that. I\u2019m interested in developing not only new playwrights but spoken word artists, choreographers and physical theatre-makers, too. What single thing would improve British theatre? An understanding that diversity, a word that gets chucked around in an affirmative-action kind of way, actually makes great business sense. The more different types of people you can attract the better. What are the top three skills you need as an artistic director? Generosity, because leadership is about what you are comfortable giving away. Flexibility, because, Lord knows, your diary will change on a day-to-day basis. And fiscal prudence. What show have you seen recently that really made an impact on you? Emilia by Morgan Lloyd Malcolm. I hope it will come back and tour. That show [a feminist call to arms with a diverse, all-female cast] needs to be in schools, in youth clubs, student productions \u2013 wherever it can reach young people, especially girls. What books are on your bedside table? Playwriting by the late, great dramatist Stephen Jeffreys, which is the most astonishing analysis of the craft ever. He was a genius on structure and character, the nuts and bolts of it, the practical as well as the ethereal. And Beloved by Toni Morrison, the most important book I have read. How would you sell theatre to someone who says they are not the theatre-going type? I would say that if you love going to standup comedy, you love going clubbing, you love going to cabaret and you love going to a gig then, actually, you love theatre. LO\u2019K Charlotte Bennett &amp; Katie Posner: \u2018If you\u2019ve had a terrible day but can still laugh, then it\u2019s OK\u2019 Paines Plough Charlotte Bennett and Katie Posner, who take over as joint artistic directors at the London touring theatre company Paines Plough in August, met while directing separate plays at York Theatre Royal 10 years ago. Bennett, who grew up in Leeds, had just started her own company, Forward Theatre Project, while Posner, a Londoner, was working for York\u2019s Pilot theatre. \u201cOver time, we became artistic mentors to each other,\u201d says Bennett. \u201cAnd because we were both working with touring companies, we had lots of big chats about the joys and difficulties of that.\u201d A decade on, with Bennett heading up the new writing department at Soho theatre, and Posner directing shows around the country on a freelance basis, both women had their eye on the top job at Paines Plough. When it came up, they decided to pool their strengths rather than compete. Their mission at the 45-year-old company, which focuses entirely on new writing and has worked with writers such as Sarah Kane, Mark Ravenhill, Enda Walsh, Abi Morgan and Mike Bartlett, will be \u201cchampioning the unheard and reaching the overlooked\u201d, according to Bennett. Posner adds: \u201cIt\u2019s about finding exciting artists who wouldn\u2019t necessarily define themselves as playwrights, and telling stories in unique and brilliant ways to make the industry wake up.\u201d What three words sum up your theatre? KP Everywhere, unafraid, immediate. What is your current audience like and how will you attract new ones? CB Our audience is shape-shifting. Roundabout [the company\u2019s pop-up auditorium] starts in Edinburgh at the fringe and goes on to places like Poole, Salford and Doncaster, so the audience changes with each place. In terms of attracting new audiences, it\u2019s about telling new stories in new ways. Sell theatre to someone who says they\u2019re not the theatre-going type\u2026 KP There\u2019s no one size fits all. You just have a conversation with them. \u201cWhat do you enjoy? What excites you?\u201d I directed a play about football for Northern Stage, and we\u2019d go hang out in pubs in Newcastle and chat to people about what we were doing \u2013 and we genuinely saw such a different audience as a result. What single thing would improve British theatre? CB Placing more value on arts in education. With arts subjects going out of the curriculum in schools across the country, it\u2019s sending a message to young people that the arts are not an important part of their lives or career prospects. Which theatre, Britain or beyond, do you most like going to and why? CB Live theatre in Newcastle, because it was born out of a working-class arts movement in the city. There\u2019s no room for ego or pretension, and there\u2019s a real honesty in geordie audiences. Before Margaret Thatcher died, I did a show that contained a quote from her last day in office, saying: \u201cI feel very happy that I\u2019m leaving the country in a better state.\u201d Every night, the audience shouted back: \u201cFuck off!\u201d It was amazing. What show have you seen recently that really made an impact on you? KP It\u2019s the same for both of us: Misty at the Bush theatre. Arinz\u00e9 Kene is incredible. Walking into that space and having a visceral reaction to something that grappled with form in an innovative way, it blew our minds. Who or what first got you into theatre? CB My older sister [Helen Bradley, now deputy head of development at Guildhall School of Music and Drama]. She was my role model and still is. After she went to Hull and did a drama degree, I went to Hull and did a drama degree. When she worked at the Royal Court and posted me plays, I duly directed them. That\u2019s where I found my love of new writing. KP The first play I ever fell in love with was Jim Cartwright\u2019s Road. I thought, this has real people, beautiful storytelling and heart-wrenching drama. It all made sense from there. Best production you\u2019ve seen? CB Ruined by Lynn Nottage, directed by Indhu Rubasingham in 2010. I was an usher at the Almeida, so I saw it a lot of times. It was so funny and vibrant and beautiful but also completely devastating and heartbreaking and difficult. It will stay with me for ever. KP Girl from the North Country [by Conor McPherson at the Old Vic]. It was really messy and played around with language in a way that I would probably have been scared to do. It triggered a realisation that, actually, life is messy, and it\u2019s great to see that on stage. What can\u2019t you live without at work? KP Laughter. If you\u2019ve had a terrible day and things are hard, but you can still have a laugh, then it\u2019s OK. What\u2019s your other favourite art form, and does it feed into your work? CB Books and music. When I listen to music it helps me think about scenes or feelings in scenes. KP Music and sound are a major part of how I make work. The world is never silent, so I\u2019m always working to find ways of integrating sounds and music on stage. Who would be your dream colleague or actor to work with? CB Joan Littlewood, the mother of modern theatre. She was always looking for what was modern, fresh and original. KP Maxine Peake. We just saw her in Avalanche and we love her. KF Sean Foley: \u2018Brummies are generous with an amazing dry sense of humour\u2019 Birmingham Repertory theatre Sean Foley is a proud Brummie, so becoming artistic director of Birmingham Repertory theatre means coming home. It also means he is deeply aware of the importance of the Rep and its 1971 building in the cultural life of the city and the nation. \u201cIt\u2019s a historic theatre, the first in the UK to be based in its own building,\u201d he says. \u201cPre-National Theatre, it was the place Olivier wanted to go and be seen; he trained here along with John Gielgud, Ralph Richardson, Peggy Ashcroft, Paul Scofield \u2013 that\u2019s quite some heritage.\u201d Foley made his name as a writer, comedian and actor before turning to directing. He co-founded the Right Size with Hamish McColl, and their stage shows The Play What I Wrote and Do You Come Here Often? became long-running West End and Broadway hits. Other directing credits include Jeeves and Wooster in Perfect Nonsense, which won an Olivier award in 2014, The Ladykillers, Ducktastic and the unloved X Factor musical I Can\u2019t Sing!. He also directed the 2016 comedy film Mindhorn. His predecessor at the Rep, Roxana Silbert (now at Hampstead theatre), left the company in a strong position, having won praise for her promotion of diversity, championing of accessibility and continued nurturing of new writing. Stepping into her shoes is \u201ca massive challenge\u201d, says Foley. What is your current audience like and how will you attract new ones? They are Brummies, so they\u2019ll be smart, self-deprecating and surprisingly sophisticated. Birmingham people have an amazing dry sense of humour; they\u2019re very generous, too. Birmingham has the most youthful demographic in the UK and is actually the most diverse city, eclipsing even London. Yet, essentially, theatre is still a middle-class sport. It\u2019s less well-funded than it used to be, but there\u2019s nonetheless a lot of public money going into theatre, and the end results are only reaching a very small proportion of people. So that should change. And changing it is really about making shows that can appeal to a wide demographic and genuinely engage the local population by doing what theatre has done since time immemorial: telling stories that people can relate to in an exciting way. Which theatre in Britain or the rest of the world do you like going to? I really enjoyed St Ann\u2019s Warehouse in Brooklyn, recently. The vibe was great, there was a very mixed audience, and the show was superb. It was The B-Side by the Wooster Group, which consisted of three actors telling the stories behind an album of chain-gang songs and singing them. It was incredibly moving. Who or what got you into theatre? When I was at Oxford University in the mid-80s, I could not get on with any of the drama societies, so I ended up joining the Oxford Youth Theatre. The people who were running it happened to know this bunch of crazy cats who had just come back from a theatre school in Paris and set up their own company with an extremely pretentious name: Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Complicit\u00e9. To get free rehearsal space they were giving workshops. I went to a couple and thought, Ah\u2011ha, this is different. Do you have a mentor or a role model? Kenneth Branagh has been a massive influence. He directed me in The Play What I Wrote and I\u2019ve worked with him many times since then and learned a lot from him about leading creative projects. He is a brilliant leader. What can\u2019t you live without at work? Coffee and bananas, not necessarily in that order. What\u2019s your other favourite art form and does it feed into your work? Film is a big love of mine. One of my heroes is Billy Wilder. He understood the importance of rhythm, pace and storytelling, all of which are essential elements in the way I direct, especially with comedy. What books are on your bedside table? A Single Man by Christopher Isherwood because I am reading it with my book club; The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin by David Nobbs because I am trying to make a musical out of it for the Rep; and Lowborn by Kerry Hudson because it feels absolutely of this moment. Who would be your dream actor or directing colleague to work with? Buster Keaton and Joan Littlewood. Hamilton or Hamlet? This is a naughty question because you\u2019re asking me to choose between an apple and an orange. The obvious thing to do would be to choose both but I\u2019m not going to do that. I\u2019m going to say Hamlet\u2011ton. LO\u2019K Tarek Iskander: \u2018Britain needs more dialogue with work from overseas\u2019 Battersea Arts Centre Born in Sunderland to Egyptian parents, Tarek Iskander lived in Kuwait between the ages of five and 17, returning to England at the outbreak of the first Gulf war. His introduction to theatre came late. He was working as a management consultant at the NHS when, after accompanying his then partner to an audition, he ended up as an extra on Deborah Warner\u2019s 2005 production of Julius Caesar at the Barbican. \u201cWatching one of the best directors in the world, I thought: I could really do that,\u201d he recalls. Iskander went on to co-found the Yard theatre in east London, where he directed two of his own plays including Qudz, \u201ca show very close to my heart about Iraq and the Middle East\u201d. He could only afford to quit his NHS job four years ago, going on to serve as interim director for theatre at Arts Council England. BAC, where he is now artistic director and chief executive, has been staging experimental theatre and testing out works in progress (what it refers to as \u201cscratch\u201d theatre) at its sprawling Victorian premises near Clapham Junction in south London since the 1970s. Iskander has been a regular there for years. \u201cIt was a place that always surprised me, where I could see the artists I was most excited about and never really knew what I was going to get,\u201d he says. What three words sum up your theatre? Surprising, unpredictable, pioneering. What single thing would improve British theatre? Having more exchange and dialogue with international work. We are absolute leaders in some areas, such as inclusiveness and diversity, but we would benefit from further exchange, especially around artistic practice. It can come from anywhere \u2013 we\u2019ve learned a lot by working with our colleagues in favelas in Brazil \u2013 but you have to engage with the world in order to benefit from that expertise. What show have you seen recently that really made an impact on you? Selina Thompson\u2019s Salt has haunted me ever since I first saw it in Edinburgh, and it moved me deeply when I saw it again recently \u2013 it\u2019s a remarkable piece of dialogue and conversation. Top three skills you need as an artistic director? You need to be open to possibilities wherever they arise, willing to make tough decisions when necessary, and engaged with what\u2019s happening in the community around you. What can\u2019t you live without at work? Caffeine. It starts with a cappuccino, then becomes really, really strong black coffee by late afternoon. What\u2019s your favourite art form aside from theatre? Recently I\u2019ve really started to get into dance, much more than previously, so I\u2019m finding myself constantly going to dance performances. What books are on your bedside table? I\u2019m reading quite a lot of David Mitchell \u2013 most recently Number9Dream, which I think is my favourite of his \u2013 and Ben Okri, his poems rather than his novels. Next up is Wolf Hall by Hilary Mantel. Hamilton or Hamlet? Hamilton, because it\u2019s fresh. Who would be your dream colleague? Benjamin Zephaniah, either performing or developing a piece of work, a story that we could really get our teeth into. I\u2019m interested in his focus on ecology and vegetarianism. What should we come and see at your theatre? One by Bert and Nasi (30 September-19 October). I have seen this show twice and it\u2019s that rare combination of hilarious but also deeply profound and moving. KF",

      "body": "<p>On a recent Sunday, in a large hall in St Alban\u2019s church in Birmingham, a group of immigrants from Iran, Turkey and Iraq sit for lunch with volunteers from a charity called <a href=\"https://www.localwelcome.org/\" title=\"\">Local Welcome.</a> As locals cheer the annual V\u00e9lo Birmingham &amp; Midlands cycle ride, the refugees are collected from their hostel. On arrival at the church, they are met by Sunday worshippers. The refugees and local volunteers are then organised into three groups to make large helpings of salad, tabbouleh and potato rostis. At one table, where Local Welcome volunteers and refugees dice tomatoes and onions for the tabbouleh, the men and women talk about their favourite food, hobbies and music.</p> <p>Local Welcome is one of a growing number of nationwide charities and social enterprises that use food and cooking skills to help refugees to improve their English and to create local networks, so that they can contribute to British life.</p> <p>A decade of austerity and government cuts to English language classes has left many refugees and immigrants feeling vulnerable and isolated.

Each month, volunteers are invited to visit a venue to prepare and eat lunch with refugees or immigrants. Volunteer leaders, who want to take charge of each meal, pay a monthly subscription of \u00a35. Ordinary members pay \u00a35 for each lunch they attend. The funds raised cover the cost of all the ingredients. Refugees and immigrants eat for free.</p> <p>\u201cWe wanted to bring together not just people who are different, but people who are isolated, and give them a simple but fun and authentic experience in their local community,\u201d says founder Ben Pollard. </p> <p>Many people are unaware how immigrants navigate their daily challenges, such as learning a new language or networking. \u201cWe don\u2019t always get to sit beside and speak with people who are going through the asylum-seeking process,\u201d says Gerry Sykes, parish priest at St Alban\u2019s church, where Local Welcome has held five lunches. </p> <p>There are other projects around the country with a similar aim. At a supper club in Manchester called Heart &amp; Parcel, migrant women improve their English while cooking and hosting food nights featuring cuisine from countries such as Bangladesh, Egypt and Syria. The emphasis on learning English helps counteract a drop in local funding for English courses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"329e54753a7cea43162b088f6d02ac3812cfa03b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/329e54753a7cea43162b088f6d02ac3812cfa03b/0_292_2339_2923/800.jpg\" alt=\"Food to share at the Local Welcome lunch.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Food to share at the Local Welcome lunch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Shepherd/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The ability to cook and prepare food among strangers can unlock confidence and potential. Inside Crossway Christian Centre in London\u2019s Elephant &amp; Castle, a group of around 30 adults attend a weekly cooking class run by a social enterprise called Migrateful.</p> <p>Many of the men and women who attend are unable to work because of their legal status. The classes help asylum seekers and refugees to improve their English and cooking skills, and there are also lessons in how to develop their CV for British employers and how to improve their interview techniques.</p> <p>On a recent Tuesday morning, a group of men and women listen as founder Jess Thompson outlines future classes on public speaking. Afterwards they work in groups to cook Lebanese and Filipino food.</p> <p>Selam Mengisto, 23, from Eritrea has been living in the UK for nearly two years and hopes to find a job in a restaurant after gaining a related qualification. \u201cBecause of the political situation in my country, I left Eritrea without anything. When I was coming through Europe, I learned a little about cooking food from Italy and France. When I first came to the UK, I always cooked for myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe realised that people who can cook can use it to achieve other goals,\u201d says Thompson. \u201cMany of the people we see have lost their confidence because they haven\u2019t worked in a long time. Cooking offers them a way to improve language skills, make networks and find work. Not everyone wants to be a chef or work in a restaurant, but cooking can lead to new ideas. We also train them to share their stories, which gives them a sense of worth and healing.\u201d</p> <p>Migrateful runs a 10-week training programme for cooks who want to cater for events such as birthdays and parties. Thompson writes references to help refugees achieve qualifications and find jobs once they gain settled status. The enterprise, which launched in 2017, also organises pop-ups in restaurants across London, and alumni chefs from countries such as Iran and Ethiopia have been trained to run catering businesses and hold cooking classes for private clients.</p> <p>Local groups specialising in food can also offer other skills. In Glasgow\u2019s Victoria Road, near the city\u2019s sprawling Queen\u2019s Park, a coffee shop called MILK is also a social enterprise.

      "bodyText": "On a recent Sunday, in a large hall in St Alban\u2019s church in Birmingham, a group of immigrants from Iran, Turkey and Iraq sit for lunch with volunteers from a charity called Local Welcome. As locals cheer the annual V\u00e9lo Birmingham &amp; Midlands cycle ride, the refugees are collected from their hostel. On arrival at the church, they are met by Sunday worshippers. The refugees and local volunteers are then organised into three groups to make large helpings of salad, tabbouleh and potato rostis. At one table, where Local Welcome volunteers and refugees dice tomatoes and onions for the tabbouleh, the men and women talk about their favourite food, hobbies and music. Local Welcome is one of a growing number of nationwide charities and social enterprises that use food and cooking skills to help refugees to improve their English and to create local networks, so that they can contribute to British life. A decade of austerity and government cuts to English language classes has left many refugees and immigrants feeling vulnerable and isolated. A new report by the charity Refugee Action has revealed that funding for English lessons for refugees and other immigrants has more than halved in the past 10 years \u2013 from around \u00a3212m in 2008 to \u00a3105m in 2018 \u2013 and that these cuts are related to increased feelings of isolation as well as difficulties in finding work. Local Welcome launched in January with \u00a3512,000 in funding from the National Lottery Community Fund. Each month, volunteers are invited to visit a venue to prepare and eat lunch with refugees or immigrants. Volunteer leaders, who want to take charge of each meal, pay a monthly subscription of \u00a35. Ordinary members pay \u00a35 for each lunch they attend. The funds raised cover the cost of all the ingredients. Refugees and immigrants eat for free. \u201cWe wanted to bring together not just people who are different, but people who are isolated, and give them a simple but fun and authentic experience in their local community,\u201d says founder Ben Pollard. Many people are unaware how immigrants navigate their daily challenges, such as learning a new language or networking. \u201cWe don\u2019t always get to sit beside and speak with people who are going through the asylum-seeking process,\u201d says Gerry Sykes, parish priest at St Alban\u2019s church, where Local Welcome has held five lunches. There are other projects around the country with a similar aim. At a supper club in Manchester called Heart &amp; Parcel, migrant women improve their English while cooking and hosting food nights featuring cuisine from countries such as Bangladesh, Egypt and Syria. The emphasis on learning English helps counteract a drop in local funding for English courses. The ability to cook and prepare food among strangers can unlock confidence and potential. Inside Crossway Christian Centre in London\u2019s Elephant &amp; Castle, a group of around 30 adults attend a weekly cooking class run by a social enterprise called Migrateful. Many of the men and women who attend are unable to work because of their legal status. The classes help asylum seekers and refugees to improve their English and cooking skills, and there are also lessons in how to develop their CV for British employers and how to improve their interview techniques. On a recent Tuesday morning, a group of men and women listen as founder Jess Thompson outlines future classes on public speaking. Afterwards they work in groups to cook Lebanese and Filipino food. Selam Mengisto, 23, from Eritrea has been living in the UK for nearly two years and hopes to find a job in a restaurant after gaining a related qualification. \u201cBecause of the political situation in my country, I left Eritrea without anything. When I was coming through Europe, I learned a little about cooking food from Italy and France. When I first came to the UK, I always cooked for myself.\u201d \u201cWe realised that people who can cook can use it to achieve other goals,\u201d says Thompson. \u201cMany of the people we see have lost their confidence because they haven\u2019t worked in a long time. Cooking offers them a way to improve language skills, make networks and find work. Not everyone wants to be a chef or work in a restaurant, but cooking can lead to new ideas. We also train them to share their stories, which gives them a sense of worth and healing.\u201d Migrateful runs a 10-week training programme for cooks who want to cater for events such as birthdays and parties. Thompson writes references to help refugees achieve qualifications and find jobs once they gain settled status. The enterprise, which launched in 2017, also organises pop-ups in restaurants across London, and alumni chefs from countries such as Iran and Ethiopia have been trained to run catering businesses and hold cooking classes for private clients. Local groups specialising in food can also offer other skills. In Glasgow\u2019s Victoria Road, near the city\u2019s sprawling Queen\u2019s Park, a coffee shop called MILK is also a social enterprise. Women from countries such as Eritrea and Afghanistan volunteer to help run the cafe. MILK, which launched in 2015, offers free art and sewing classes, hosts open-mic events and is a space for pop-up restaurants. \u201cNewcomers to this area can often find themselves isolated,\u201d says Gaby Clunnes, MILK\u2019s co-founder and co-director. \u201cWithout strong English skills, migrant women can struggle to find work and make the most of their skills. We wanted to find a space where they could both teach and learn new things, and meet people who could help them develop the contacts they need.\u201d Back at Migrateful\u2019s class in Elephant &amp; Castle, Awa Sammeh, from Gambia, makes a dish of yoghurt and shredded cucumber. Before arriving in the UK in 2012, she worked in the kitchen of a five-star hotel in Tunisia. She now works three days a week at a Lebanese restaurant in Chelsea. \u201cClasses like this are good for my self-confidence,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel like I am planning for my future by coming here.

      "bodyText": "On a spring afternoon last year, a 13-year-old boy called at the home of Ana Kri\u00e9gel, a 14-year-old girl living in the Dublin suburb of Lucan. He had exciting news: his friend, whom she had a crush on, wanted to meet her. Ana was delighted. She grabbed her hoodie and followed him through a park to a derelict farmhouse where his friend, also aged 13, was waiting. It was a trap. The object of her affection had prepared for this moment, assembling what police would later call a \u201cmurder kit\u201d: zombie mask, black gloves, shin guards, knee pads. His weapons were a long stick and a concrete block. What unfolded inside that house led last week to both boys, now aged 14, becoming the youngest people in Irish history to be convicted of murder. The case has shocked Ireland and evoked comparisons to the 1993 James Bulger atrocity. \u201cWhat has shaken our fundamental assumptions about childhood is that the convicted perpetrators of this crime are children themselves,\u201d said Chris McCusker, a lecturer in clinical psychology at University College Cork. \u201cIt invites a lynch-mob mentality, fuelled by assumptions of evil in our midst.\u201d Social media \u2013 in its worst form \u2013 bookends the case. Ana had few friends and was lonely. She sought to connect with peers via YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat and other platforms only to end up bullied \u2013 targeted for sexual innuendo and threats. One comment on her YouTube channel expressed a desire to \u201chave her executed\u201d. Her offence was to be slightly different: adopted from Russia, she was tall, striking and had poor short-term memory, eyesight and hearing, the latter the result of a tumour she\u2019d had removed. She was deemed socially awkward, a \u201cweirdo\u201d. Social media abuse dehumanised her and now, in death, seeks to avenge her.

Cyber-vigilantes have flouted the ban by naming the pair and posting their pictures on Twitter and Facebook, along with lurid incitements. They have also made threats against their families, a teacher and other boys wrongly identified as the killers. A lawyer for Boy B said the family had gone into hiding. Detectives from the Garda station in Lucan who carried out the murder investigation are now hunting the would-be avengers, who could face up to three years in jail. Twitter and Facebook \u2013 accustomed to red-carpet treatment by the authorities in Dublin, where they have their European headquarters \u2013 have been sucked into the imbroglio. Representatives from both companies were summoned to a court hearing on Thursday to face contempt of court accusations over the publication of photographs identifying the killers. Lawyers said the companies could not block in advance what users posted nor pre-empt naming of the boys since the companies did not know the boys\u2019 names. Justice Michael White upheld an injunction requiring the companies to remove any material identifying the boys but tweaked the wording so that they are expected to act after being made aware of such material. He branded social media users who identified the killers as \u201cidiots\u201d and urged the police to pursue them \u201cwith vigour\u201d. It is a fraught, messy aftermath to a case that will haunt Ireland. Tusla, the state\u2019s children and family agency, issued guidance for parents unsure how to discuss it with children. \u201cThe trial may elicit a range of feelings such as shock, anger, upset, feeling unsafe, or difficulty in trusting others.

The last conversation we had was how can we get him out of there. The best option was to make his way into Jordan or Turkey and on to a UK embassy, where he would surrender and face the consequences when he got back and also open himself up to rehabilitation. It would have worked.\u201d</p> <p>Qadir was appointed to the case on approval from the South East Counter Terrorism Command, the Home Office and with the backing of Letts\u2019s parents. He had more than 20 conversations with the Isis recruit between October 2015 and early 2016. The Home Office does not comment on individual cases, but has said it would try to block Isis recruits hoping to return to the UK.</p> <p>Qadir said that he challenged Letts repeatedly on the theological underpinnings of Isis and that although confrontational initially, he gradually became more open.</p> <p>In 2017 Letts left Isis after becoming disillusioned with the group, but was captured and is currently in jail in northern Syria. \u201cHe wanted to speak to me, that\u2019s the best aspect of an intervention from an expert perspective.

They were cleared of sending him a further \u00a31,000 and a verdict could not be reached on a third charge related to an attempt to send \u00a3500.</p> <p>The couple defied police warnings, along with those from Qadir, not to send money to Letts, because of concerns he had joined Isis. His parents, from Oxford, refused to believe that Jack had become an extremist, and sent the money, as they believed he was in danger.</p> <p>\u201cHe was definitely radicalised, the ideology was very much aligned to that of Daesh [Isis] but there was an opportunity for deradicalisation and rehabilitation,\u201d said Qadir.</p> <p>However, Qadir was taken off the case as part of an approach introduced by Theresa May in the Home Office of disengagement with radicalised individuals. \u201cThey just told me to back off and drop everything.

      "bodyText": "British Islamic State fighter Jack Letts, whose parents were convicted of funding terrorism, wanted to return to the UK, but the Home Office pulled the plug on attempts to rehabilitate him. The 23-year-old \u2013 known as \u201cJihadi Jack\u201d \u2013 who joined Isis as a teenager, had discussed leaving Syria in 2016 with a counter-radicalisation expert until the UK government took him off the Letts case, the Observer has learned. On Friday his parents were found guilty of funding terror by sending money to Letts while he was living with Isis in Syria. The Muslim convert, currently in custody in a Kurdish jail, told his Home Office-appointed counter-terrorism specialist that he was prepared to come home to face the UK authorities. Hanif Qadir, who worked for the government\u2019s counter-extremism programme Prevent, had a series of Facebook conversations with Letts while he was in Syria. \u201cHe definitely wanted to leave that place. The last conversation we had was how can we get him out of there. The best option was to make his way into Jordan or Turkey and on to a UK embassy, where he would surrender and face the consequences when he got back and also open himself up to rehabilitation. It would have worked.\u201d Qadir was appointed to the case on approval from the South East Counter Terrorism Command, the Home Office and with the backing of Letts\u2019s parents. He had more than 20 conversations with the Isis recruit between October 2015 and early 2016. The Home Office does not comment on individual cases, but has said it would try to block Isis recruits hoping to return to the UK. Qadir said that he challenged Letts repeatedly on the theological underpinnings of Isis and that although confrontational initially, he gradually became more open. In 2017 Letts left Isis after becoming disillusioned with the group, but was captured and is currently in jail in northern Syria. \u201cHe wanted to speak to me, that\u2019s the best aspect of an intervention from an expert perspective. His mother was also convinced he was ready to leave,\u201d said Qadir. On Friday his parents John Letts, 58, an internationally renowned organic grain farmer, and Sally Lane, 57, a former Oxfam fundraiser, were found guilty of one charge of funding terrorism by sending \u00a3223 in 2015. They were cleared of sending him a further \u00a31,000 and a verdict could not be reached on a third charge related to an attempt to send \u00a3500. The couple defied police warnings, along with those from Qadir, not to send money to Letts, because of concerns he had joined Isis. His parents, from Oxford, refused to believe that Jack had become an extremist, and sent the money, as they believed he was in danger. \u201cHe was definitely radicalised, the ideology was very much aligned to that of Daesh [Isis] but there was an opportunity for deradicalisation and rehabilitation,\u201d said Qadir. However, Qadir was taken off the case as part of an approach introduced by Theresa May in the Home Office of disengagement with radicalised individuals. \u201cThey just told me to back off and drop everything. It was amazing, because high-risk intervention work was suddenly put on the back burner,\u201d said Qadir. In an interview with the BBC, Letts said that he would not appeal to the British public to give him a second chance. Letts admitted that he fought for Isis but he did not believe he had killed anyone. A dual national, Letts also confirmed he had been in contact with Canadian authorities who are understood to be allowing him to leave Syria for Canada.",

It was a good old-fashioned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2019/may/24/real-v-fake-debunking-the-drunk-nancy-pelosi-footage-video\" title=\"\">doctored video of Nancy Pelosi</a>, the speaker of the US House of Representatives. There were no fancy AIs involved; the video had simply been slowed down to about 75% of its usual speed, and the pitch of her voice raised to keep it sounding natural. It could have been done 50 years ago. But it made her look convincingly drunk or incapable, and was shared millions of times across every platform, including by Rudi Giuliani \u2013 Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer and the former mayor of New York.</p> \n<p>It got people worrying about fake videos in general, and deepfakes in particular. Since the Pelosi video came out, a deepfake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/11/deepfake-zuckerberg-instagram-facebook\" title=\"\">Mark Zuckerberg apparently talking</a> about how he has \u201ctotal control of billions of people\u2019s stolen data\u201d and how he \u201cowe[s] it all to Spectre\u201d, the product of a team of satirical artists, went viral as well. Last year, the Oscar-winning director Jordan Peele and his brother-in-law, BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti, created a <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/obama-fake-news-jordan-peele-psa-video-buzzfeed#.ugOXGqvAn3\" title=\"\">deepfake of Barack Obama</a> apparently calling Trump a \u201ccomplete and utter dipshit\u201d to warn of the risks to public discourse.</p> \n<p>A lot of our fears about technology are overstated. For instance, despite worries about screen time and social media, in general, <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/116/21/10226\" title=\"\">high-quality research</a> shows that there\u2019s little evidence of it having a major impact on our mental health. Every generation has its techno-panic: video nasties, violent computer games, pulp novels.</p> \n<p>But, says <a href=\"https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/sandra-wachter/\" title=\"\">Sandra Wachter</a>, a professor in the law and ethics of AI at the Oxford Internet Institute, deepfakes might be a different matter. \u201cI can understand the public concern,\u201d she says. \u201cAny tech developing so quickly could have unforeseen and unintended consequences.\u201d It\u2019s not that fake videos or misinformation are new, but things are changing so fast, she says, that it\u2019s challenging our ability to keep up. \u201cThe sophisticated way in which fake information can be created, how fast it can be created, and how endlessly it can be disseminated is on a different level. In the past, I could have spread lies, but my range was limited.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"87f812b8-2dda-4e44-bac0-a7c407f304c6\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/F7_DBM7OIfM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Here\u2019s how deepfakes work. They are the product of not one but two AI algorithms, which work together in something called a \u201cgenerative adversarial network\u201d, or Gan. The two algorithms are called the generator and the discriminator.</p> \n<p>Imagine a Gan that has been designed to create believable spam emails. The discriminator would be exactly the same as a real spam filter algorithm: it would simply sort all emails into either \u201cspam\u201d or \u201cnot spam\u201d. It would do that by being given a huge folder of emails, and determining which elements were most often associated with the ones it was told were spam: perhaps words like \u201cenlarger\u201d or \u201cpills\u201d or \u201can accident that wasn\u2019t your fault\u201d. That folder is its \u201ctraining set\u201d. Then, as new emails came in, it would give each one a rating based on how many of these features it detected: 60% likely to be spam, 90% likely, and so on. All emails above a certain threshold would go into the spam folder. The bigger its training set, the better it gets at establishing real from fake.</p> \n<p>But the generator algorithm works the other way. It takes that same dataset and uses it to build new emails that <em>don\u2019t</em> look like spam. It knows to avoid words like \u201cpenis\u201d or \u201cwon an iPad\u201d. And when it makes them, it puts them into the stream of data going through the discriminator. The two are in competition: if the discriminator is fooled, the generator \u201cwins\u201d; if it isn\u2019t, the discriminator \u201cwins\u201d. And either way, it\u2019s a new piece of data for the Gan. The discriminator gets better at telling fake from real, so the generator has to get better at creating the fakes. It is an arms race, a self-reinforcing cycle. This same system can be used for creating almost any digital product: spam emails, art, music \u2013 or, of course, videos.</p> \n<p>Gans are hugely powerful, says <a href=\"https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/christina-hitrova\" title=\"\">Christina Hitrova</a>, a researcher in digital ethics at the Alan Turing Institute for AI, and have many interesting uses \u2013 they\u2019re not just for creating deepfakes.

      "bodyText": "There exist, on the internet, any number of videos that show people doing things they never did. Real people, real faces, close to photorealistic footage; entirely unreal events. These videos are called deepfakes, and they\u2019re made using a particular kind of AI. Inevitably enough, they began in porn \u2013 there is a thriving online market for celebrity faces superimposed on porn actors\u2019 bodies \u2013 but the reason we\u2019re talking about them now is that people are worried about their impact on our already fervid political debate. Those worries are real enough to prompt the British government and the US Congress to look at ways of regulating them. The video that kicked off the sudden concern last month was, in fact, not a deepfake at all. It was a good old-fashioned doctored video of Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the US House of Representatives. There were no fancy AIs involved; the video had simply been slowed down to about 75% of its usual speed, and the pitch of her voice raised to keep it sounding natural. It could have been done 50 years ago. But it made her look convincingly drunk or incapable, and was shared millions of times across every platform, including by Rudi Giuliani \u2013 Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer and the former mayor of New York. It got people worrying about fake videos in general, and deepfakes in particular. Since the Pelosi video came out, a deepfake of Mark Zuckerberg apparently talking about how he has \u201ctotal control of billions of people\u2019s stolen data\u201d and how he \u201cowe[s] it all to Spectre\u201d, the product of a team of satirical artists, went viral as well. Last year, the Oscar-winning director Jordan Peele and his brother-in-law, BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti, created a deepfake of Barack Obama apparently calling Trump a \u201ccomplete and utter dipshit\u201d to warn of the risks to public discourse. A lot of our fears about technology are overstated. For instance, despite worries about screen time and social media, in general, high-quality research shows that there\u2019s little evidence of it having a major impact on our mental health. Every generation has its techno-panic: video nasties, violent computer games, pulp novels. But, says Sandra Wachter, a professor in the law and ethics of AI at the Oxford Internet Institute, deepfakes might be a different matter. \u201cI can understand the public concern,\u201d she says. \u201cAny tech developing so quickly could have unforeseen and unintended consequences.\u201d It\u2019s not that fake videos or misinformation are new, but things are changing so fast, she says, that it\u2019s challenging our ability to keep up. \u201cThe sophisticated way in which fake information can be created, how fast it can be created, and how endlessly it can be disseminated is on a different level. In the past, I could have spread lies, but my range was limited.\u201d Here\u2019s how deepfakes work. They are the product of not one but two AI algorithms, which work together in something called a \u201cgenerative adversarial network\u201d, or Gan. The two algorithms are called the generator and the discriminator. Imagine a Gan that has been designed to create believable spam emails. The discriminator would be exactly the same as a real spam filter algorithm: it would simply sort all emails into either \u201cspam\u201d or \u201cnot spam\u201d. It would do that by being given a huge folder of emails, and determining which elements were most often associated with the ones it was told were spam: perhaps words like \u201cenlarger\u201d or \u201cpills\u201d or \u201can accident that wasn\u2019t your fault\u201d. That folder is its \u201ctraining set\u201d. Then, as new emails came in, it would give each one a rating based on how many of these features it detected: 60% likely to be spam, 90% likely, and so on. All emails above a certain threshold would go into the spam folder. The bigger its training set, the better it gets at establishing real from fake. But the generator algorithm works the other way. It takes that same dataset and uses it to build new emails that don\u2019t look like spam. It knows to avoid words like \u201cpenis\u201d or \u201cwon an iPad\u201d. And when it makes them, it puts them into the stream of data going through the discriminator. The two are in competition: if the discriminator is fooled, the generator \u201cwins\u201d; if it isn\u2019t, the discriminator \u201cwins\u201d. And either way, it\u2019s a new piece of data for the Gan. The discriminator gets better at telling fake from real, so the generator has to get better at creating the fakes. It is an arms race, a self-reinforcing cycle. This same system can be used for creating almost any digital product: spam emails, art, music \u2013 or, of course, videos. Gans are hugely powerful, says Christina Hitrova, a researcher in digital ethics at the Alan Turing Institute for AI, and have many interesting uses \u2013 they\u2019re not just for creating deepfakes. The photorealistic imaginary people at ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com are all created with Gans. Discriminatory algorithms (such as spam filters) can be improved by Gans creating ever better things to test them with. It can do amazing things with pictures, including sharpening up fuzzy ones or colourising black-and-white ones. \u201cScientists are also exploring using Gans to create virtual chemical molecules,\u201d says Hitrova, \u201cto speed up materials science and medical discoveries: you can generate new molecules and simulate them to see what they can do.\u201d Gans were only invented in 2014, but have already become one of the most exciting tools in AI. But they are widely available, easy to use, and increasingly sophisticated, able to create ever more believable videos. \u201cThere\u2019s some way to go before the fakes are undetectable,\u201d says Hitrova. \u201cFor instance, with CGI faces, they haven\u2019t quite perfected the generation of teeth or eyes that look natural.

But, says Hitrova, \u201cObviously that\u2019s going to feed into the fake generator to produce even better fakes.\u201d For instance, she says, one tool was able to identify deepfakes by looking at the pattern of blinking. But then the next generation will take that into account, and future discriminators will have to use something else. The arms race that goes on inside Gans will go on outside, as well. Other technological solutions include hashing \u2013 essentially a form of digital watermarking, giving a video file a short string of numbers which is lost if the video is tampered with \u2013 or, controversially, \u201cauthenticated alibis\u201d, wherein public figures constantly record where they are and what they\u2019re doing, so that if a deepfake circulates apparently showing them doing something they want to disprove, they can show what they were really doing. That idea has been tentatively floated by the AI law specialist Danielle Citron, but as Hitrova points out, it has \u201cdystopian\u201d implications.

He was social worker Nitin in Channel 4 comedy <em>Damned</em> and now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/05/yesterday-review-the-beatles-richard-curtis-danny-boyle-himesh-patel\" title=\"\">takes the lead role of Jack in musical romcom </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/05/yesterday-review-the-beatles-richard-curtis-danny-boyle-himesh-patel\" title=\"\">Yesterday</a></em>, written by Richard Curtis and directed by Danny Boyle, which imagines an alternative universe in which everyone except Jack has forgotten the Beatles ever existed.</p> <p><strong>People are calling </strong><em><strong>Yesterday</strong></em><strong> your \u201cbreakthrough role\u201d. Does it feel that way?</strong><br>It does, although I\u2019m not sure what exactly I\u2019ve broken through! It\u2019s the sort of part I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d ever get to play but I just happened to be right for the role. It wasn\u2019t written for someone of any specific ethnicity and we didn\u2019t shoehorn it in afterwards. We need those kind of advances too, as well as deliberate steps forward like <em>Black Panther</em>, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/14/why-black-panther-should-win-the-2019-best-picture-oscar\" title=\"\">very consciously the first black superhero movie</a>. My character\u2019s background isn\u2019t even mentioned, it\u2019s just there as a statement of fact and that\u2019s powerful in itself.</p> <p><strong>How did you come to be cast as struggling singer-songwriter </strong><strong>Jack Malik</strong><strong>?</strong><br>I was doing [stage play] <em>People, Places &amp; Things</em> in New York and got asked to do an audition tape for an \u201cuntitled Danny Boyle project with musical elements\u201d. They wanted me to do a monologue from a play and perform a Coldplay song on acoustic guitar. Back in London, I met Danny and Richard [Curtis], then got the script and was blown away by this comedic love story that was a celebration of the Beatles. After another audition, I got the part. It was a crazy couple of months.</p> <p><strong>Was the Coldplay song because Jack\u2019s mentor, played by Ed Sheeran, was originally going to be Chris Martin?</strong><br>Yes, it was Chris Martin in the first draft. But really it was always destined to be Ed Sheeran because the story mirrors his journey in many ways. Ed was brilliant: down to earth, funny, totally willing to send himself up \u2013 and so relaxed on camera.</p> <p><strong>Did you learn guitar for the part or could you already play?</strong><br>Vaguely. When I was 14, I bought myself a cheap electric guitar and tried to teach myself. When this film came along, it was a reason to apply myself properly. I sat down with Adem Ilhan, who\u2019s a great musician and composer, and we spent two months in a room, which we made to look like Jack\u2019s bedroom, just jamming and learning to play my own way.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3VeHyedL1U\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/H3VeHyedL1U?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3VeHyedL1U\">Watch a trailer for Yesterday.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>You play in front of some huge crowds in </strong><em><strong>Yesterday</strong></em><strong>. Did it give you a taste for rock stardom?</strong><br>For sure. It was so thrilling, I can see why it becomes addictive.</p> <p><strong>Have Paul McCartney or Ringo Starr seen the film yet?</strong><br>We got their blessing \u2013 the project wouldn\u2019t have gone ahead without that \u2013 but I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019ve seen it. It\u2019s weird to think about a Beatle watching me sing their songs.</p> <p><strong>Meera Syal and Sanjeev Bhaskar </strong><strong>play your parents. As trailblazers of British Asian comedy, were they a big influence on you?</strong><br>Absolutely, all four stars of <em>Goodness Gracious Me</em> were. They were the main brown people on TV when I was growing up. When the trailer came out, Sanj emailed to congratulate me. I replied saying our generation are standing on their shoulders.

      "bodyText": "Cambridgeshire-born Himesh Patel, 28, discovered a love of drama at school. At 16, he landed the role of Tamwar Masood on EastEnders, a part he played for nine years. He was social worker Nitin in Channel 4 comedy Damned and now takes the lead role of Jack in musical romcom Yesterday, written by Richard Curtis and directed by Danny Boyle, which imagines an alternative universe in which everyone except Jack has forgotten the Beatles ever existed. People are calling Yesterday your \u201cbreakthrough role\u201d. Does it feel that way? It does, although I\u2019m not sure what exactly I\u2019ve broken through! It\u2019s the sort of part I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d ever get to play but I just happened to be right for the role. It wasn\u2019t written for someone of any specific ethnicity and we didn\u2019t shoehorn it in afterwards. We need those kind of advances too, as well as deliberate steps forward like Black Panther, which was very consciously the first black superhero movie. My character\u2019s background isn\u2019t even mentioned, it\u2019s just there as a statement of fact and that\u2019s powerful in itself. How did you come to be cast as struggling singer-songwriter Jack Malik? I was doing [stage play] People, Places &amp; Things in New York and got asked to do an audition tape for an \u201cuntitled Danny Boyle project with musical elements\u201d. They wanted me to do a monologue from a play and perform a Coldplay song on acoustic guitar. Back in London, I met Danny and Richard [Curtis], then got the script and was blown away by this comedic love story that was a celebration of the Beatles. After another audition, I got the part. It was a crazy couple of months. Was the Coldplay song because Jack\u2019s mentor, played by Ed Sheeran, was originally going to be Chris Martin? Yes, it was Chris Martin in the first draft. But really it was always destined to be Ed Sheeran because the story mirrors his journey in many ways. Ed was brilliant: down to earth, funny, totally willing to send himself up \u2013 and so relaxed on camera. Did you learn guitar for the part or could you already play? Vaguely. When I was 14, I bought myself a cheap electric guitar and tried to teach myself. When this film came along, it was a reason to apply myself properly. I sat down with Adem Ilhan, who\u2019s a great musician and composer, and we spent two months in a room, which we made to look like Jack\u2019s bedroom, just jamming and learning to play my own way. You play in front of some huge crowds in Yesterday. Did it give you a taste for rock stardom? For sure. It was so thrilling, I can see why it becomes addictive. Have Paul McCartney or Ringo Starr seen the film yet? We got their blessing \u2013 the project wouldn\u2019t have gone ahead without that \u2013 but I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019ve seen it. It\u2019s weird to think about a Beatle watching me sing their songs. Meera Syal and Sanjeev Bhaskar play your parents. As trailblazers of British Asian comedy, were they a big influence on you? Absolutely, all four stars of Goodness Gracious Me were. They were the main brown people on TV when I was growing up. When the trailer came out, Sanj emailed to congratulate me. I replied saying our generation are standing on their shoulders. They paved the way. Are more doors opening for Asian actors? I like to think so. Riz Ahmed was in The Sisters Brothers, a period gold rush movie, and Dev Patel\u2019s about to play David Copperfield. I\u2019ve just filmed two things set in the 1860s: a film called The Aeronauts and a TV adaptation of Eleanor Catton\u2019s The Luminaries. These kinds of role wouldn\u2019t have been open to people of our ethnicity a few years ago. So you\u2019re getting typecast as someone from the 1860s? [Laughs] That would be an amazing turn of events \u2013 \u201cI can\u2019t get away from the period stuff!\u201d Was EastEnders a good training ground? Totally. Very grounding, too. You\u2019re not spoilt like you are on a film set. You drive yourself to work, pay for your own lunch and work hard: long days, scene after scene, last-minute line changes.

      "body": "<h2>A study in scarlet: bright red lips</h2> <p>The perfect base begins with a great, non-oily hydrator. Chanel\u2019s Camellia Water Cream is light but incredibly effective. I used a mix of foundations, but I didn\u2019t apply it everywhere \u2013 just apply it where you need it. For an even, refined finish use a brush. A dot of liquid highlighter blended on the cheekbones with a brush gives a beautiful glow. I applied concealer \u2013 using my finger \u2013 under the eyes, around the nose and mouth. I love Becca\u2019s as it is not too oily. Blend out with a concealer brush. I finish off with a dusting of powder, but only apply on the T-zone so the skin still glows. To create this look, apply black liquid eyeliner across the crease of the eyelid. Extend it out further than normal for a point of difference. Apply mascara \u2013 looking down on a mirror results in fewer smudges \u2013 only on top lashes for a more natural finish. Blot between your lipstick applications \u2013 two or three should be sufficient \u2013 to intensify the colour.</p> <p><strong>For skin prep try: </strong>Becca Aqua Luminous Concealer, \u00a321; NARS Radiant Longwear Foundation, \u00a331.50; Fenty Pro Filt\u2019r Instant Retouch Concealer, \u00a319; Becca Shimmering Skin Perfector, \u00a330; Cr\u00e8me de la Mer Loose Powder, \u00a375; Real Techniques Brushes, \u00a319. <strong>For the makeup try: </strong>L\u2019Or\u00e9al Super Liner in Black Lacquer, \u00a36.99; Chanel Les Beiges Healthy Eau de Teint Water-Fresh Tint Light Deep, \u00a348; Bobbi Brown Blusher in Rose, \u00a320; Chanel Rouge Coco Flash 60 \u2013 Beat, \u00a331; and Stila Huge Mascara, \u00a312.75</p> <h2>The eyes have it: mellow yellow</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"50936f8feb0a3adf6a584f910ab6215a77f9b5f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50936f8feb0a3adf6a584f910ab6215a77f9b5f3/83_66_2438_1463/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Watercolour effects: yellow dress by balenciaga.com; earrings by shaunleane.com.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Watercolour effects: yellow dress by <a href=\"http://balenciaga.com/\">balenciaga.com</a>; earrings by <a href=\"http://shaunleane.com/\">shaunleane.com</a>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean-Paul Pietrus/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To achieve an intense pigment around the eyes, it\u2019s best to start without a brush. Dip your finger into the colour \u2013 it should be dry not wet \u2013 and press firmly into the skin all around the eyes. The pigment at the top of the lid should be the strongest. Then take an eyeshadow brush and feather out the colour in a circular motion. This gives a watercolour effect. Do this until it blends into the surrounding skin. Apply a subtle blush. Choose a soft, less intense hue so it doesn\u2019t clash with the pigment on the eye.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"5dec4c12c3a749f9a3169cb12656a75e0874ad8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5dec4c12c3a749f9a3169cb12656a75e0874ad8d/0_2278_4912_2947/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Watercolour effects: earrings by shaunleane.com.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gentle shimmer: earrings by <a href=\"http://shaunleane.com/\">shaunleane.com</a>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean-Paul Pietrus/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Try:</strong> Huda Beauty Nude Love Lipstick in Sugar Mama, \u00a318; Chanel Ombre Premi\u00e8re Gloss Eyeshadow 067 \u2013 Solaire, \u00a328; Mac Blush in Raizin, \u00a319.50; Chanel Ombre Premi\u00e8re Longwear Powder Eyeshadow 34 \u2013 Poudre D\u2019Or, \u00a326</p> <h2>Green flash: emerald effect</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"7d9444cba1c123ce754a0314b3a7c8b147ffb990\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d9444cba1c123ce754a0314b3a7c8b147ffb990/8_112_3749_2249/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Green flash: blue dress by erdem.com; earring by zohrarahman.com.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Summer breeze: dress by <a href=\"http://erdem.com\">erdem.com</a>; earring by <a href=\"http://zohrarahman.com/\">zohrarahman.com</a>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jean-Paul Pietrus/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Take a medium-sized brush and wet it (but don\u2019t soak it).

      "bodyText": "A study in scarlet: bright red lips The perfect base begins with a great, non-oily hydrator. Chanel\u2019s Camellia Water Cream is light but incredibly effective. I used a mix of foundations, but I didn\u2019t apply it everywhere \u2013 just apply it where you need it. For an even, refined finish use a brush. A dot of liquid highlighter blended on the cheekbones with a brush gives a beautiful glow. I applied concealer \u2013 using my finger \u2013 under the eyes, around the nose and mouth. I love Becca\u2019s as it is not too oily. Blend out with a concealer brush. I finish off with a dusting of powder, but only apply on the T-zone so the skin still glows. To create this look, apply black liquid eyeliner across the crease of the eyelid. Extend it out further than normal for a point of difference. Apply mascara \u2013 looking down on a mirror results in fewer smudges \u2013 only on top lashes for a more natural finish. Blot between your lipstick applications \u2013 two or three should be sufficient \u2013 to intensify the colour. For skin prep try: Becca Aqua Luminous Concealer, \u00a321; NARS Radiant Longwear Foundation, \u00a331.50; Fenty Pro Filt\u2019r Instant Retouch Concealer, \u00a319; Becca Shimmering Skin Perfector, \u00a330; Cr\u00e8me de la Mer Loose Powder, \u00a375; Real Techniques Brushes, \u00a319. For the makeup try: L\u2019Or\u00e9al Super Liner in Black Lacquer, \u00a36.99; Chanel Les Beiges Healthy Eau de Teint Water-Fresh Tint Light Deep, \u00a348; Bobbi Brown Blusher in Rose, \u00a320; Chanel Rouge Coco Flash 60 \u2013 Beat, \u00a331; and Stila Huge Mascara, \u00a312.75 The eyes have it: mellow yellow To achieve an intense pigment around the eyes, it\u2019s best to start without a brush. Dip your finger into the colour \u2013 it should be dry not wet \u2013 and press firmly into the skin all around the eyes. The pigment at the top of the lid should be the strongest. Then take an eyeshadow brush and feather out the colour in a circular motion. This gives a watercolour effect. Do this until it blends into the surrounding skin. Apply a subtle blush. Choose a soft, less intense hue so it doesn\u2019t clash with the pigment on the eye. Try: Huda Beauty Nude Love Lipstick in Sugar Mama, \u00a318; Chanel Ombre Premi\u00e8re Gloss Eyeshadow 067 \u2013 Solaire, \u00a328; Mac Blush in Raizin, \u00a319.50; Chanel Ombre Premi\u00e8re Longwear Powder Eyeshadow 34 \u2013 Poudre D\u2019Or, \u00a326 Green flash: emerald effect Take a medium-sized brush and wet it (but don\u2019t soak it). Swirl it across the eyeshadow until you get a paint-like consistency. A lip brush that isn\u2019t too stubby is ideal \u2013 Real Technique\u2019s are some of my favourites. Regardless of how carefully you apply, this colour will get on the base of your lashes \u2013 that is unavoidable. The way around it is to take a liquid eyeliner and apply it across the root of your lashes. This will hide any mistakes and give a professional finish. Try: Kat von D Ultra Ink Liner, \u00a317; Chanel Ombre Premi\u00e8re Longwear Cream Eyeshadow 824 \u2013 Verderame, \u00a326; Hourglass Ambient Lighting Bronzer, Harrods, \u00a348; Chanel Rouge Coco Flash 72 \u2013 Rush, \u00a331 Winning streak: red lines Mix a rich powder eyeshadow with water to create a paste, or use a liquid high-intensity pigment \u2013 Make Up For Ever is brilliant. Dip the brush in the paste and simply paint on the shape you want. A medium-sized lip brush is a good way to achieve this, however you can adapt the brush size if you prefer thicker (or thinner) lines. I did an extra lip prep before applying the lipstick. Nuxe balm is great as it hydrates, but is matt so it doesn\u2019t add grease to the texture. Try: Le Volume R\u00e9volution de Chanel 10 \u2013 Noir, \u00a328; Make Up For Ever Chromatic Mix in Red, \u00a312; Bioderma Sensibio H20 Makeup Removing Solution, \u00a310; Chanel Le Rouge Crayon de Couleur Mat 259 \u2013 Provocation, \u00a331; Nuxe Reve de Miel Lip Balm, \u00a310.50 True colours: rainbow eyes This is an opportunity to play and experiment. I applied the principle of a colouring book by taking colours and placing them, very specifically, wherever I wanted, making sure I didn\u2019t layer colours over each other \u2013 otherwise you lose the boundaries between shades. I used my fingertips to keep it looking unpolished. Where I wanted more detail \u2013 the green on the lower lash line, for instance \u2013 I used a thin brush for precision. I used light-reflecting pigments for this. The shimmer is important \u2013 anything too flat will look theatrical. You can use as many colours as your eyes will allow, but best to keep to four or five. Try: Anastasia Beverly Hills Riviera Palette, \u00a346; Chanel Les 4 Ombres Multi-Effect Quadra Eyeshadow 228 \u2013 Tiss\u00e9 Cambon and 306 \u2013 Splendeur Et Audace, \u00a344; Fenty Beauty Moroccan Spice Palette, \u00a354; Chanel Rouge Allure Liquid Powder 962 \u2013 Electric Blossom, \u00a331 Model Adesuwa Aighewi at Storm Model Management; beauty direction Funmi Fetto; hair Yoshitaka Miyazaki; fashion editor Jo Jones; fashion assistant Peter Bevan",

      "bodyText": "This bizarre period piece is based on Daniel Lang\u2019s 1974 New Yorker article The Bank Drama, about an armed robbery in Stockholm. A hyperactive Ethan Hawke plays Lars Nystrom, a mustachioed, bewigged, leather-jacketed ex-convict who bustles into the Kreditbanken with a machine gun, demanding one million US dollars and \u201ca Mustang like Steve McQueen had in Bullitt\u201d in exchange for his hostage, bank teller Bianca Lind (Noomi Rapace). She falls for her daffy, inept captor; the term \u201cStockholm syndrome\u201d is invented. There\u2019s comedy in its depiction of the Swedish prime minister as a caricature of even-temperedness, but from its gaudy 70s costuming to its goofy, wobbling tone, everything about this film feels uncomfortably broad.",

Despite conceding last week the US was \u201cunlikely\u201d to resettle 1,250 refugees under the deal Malcolm Turnbull struck with the then US president, Barack Obama, and begrudgingly held to by Donald Trump, Dutton said the medevac legislation had upended the process and claimed asylum seekers and refugees were still holding out for Australia. Further ramping up the political attack he began last week, as the government seeks crossbench support to repeal the medevac legislation the parliament passed against its will in February, Dutton repeated his claim the system was at risk of being abused. \u201cWith 250 cases now being considered by doctors under the medevac laws, this is a very dangerous period for Labor to go soft on borders yet again,\u201d he said at a press conference in Brisbane. \u201cThe doctors in many cases [are] two advocates.

The US had rejected more than 300 applications so far. Before the medevac legislation was in place, Senate estimates was told 898 refugees and asylum seekers had been sent to Australia for medical treatment. Of that number, just 282 had been returned to Manus Island and Nauru, the majority of which were returned before 2015. As with existing processes, the medevac legislation contains provisions for patients to be returned to the offshore processing centres at the conclusion of their treatment. Dutton has repeatedly warned that the medevac legislation would lead to an increase in people-smugglers\u2019 boats to Australia, which has not occurred. He used the recent federal court ruling to allow doctors to make transfer decisions based on a patient\u2019s chart, and not an individual consultation, as further evidence the legislation was \u201cwatering down\u201d border security. That was despite nothing else, including the minister\u2019s ability to reject a transfer application on broad national security grounds, changing. Refugees and asylum seekers brought to the mainland for treatment remain under guard and are escorted to any medical appointments by security. The ruling was made after the decision of the Nauruan government to ban telehealth conferencing for residents. The minister maintains the power to reject any application under a broad definition of \u201cnational security\u201d. Those rejected under health grounds have that decision reviewed by an independent panel of doctors chosen by the government. As reported on Friday, of the nine cases the minister has refused, the panel has reversed just two of those decisions. But Dutton has continued to claim the legislation risked an influx of people-smuggler boats returning to Australian waters and boat turnbacks remain policy. \u201cThis is a very dangerous time,\u201d he said on Sunday. \u201cAs we know, Labor didn\u2019t get into power, but the boats were already on water, waiting to arrive into the open arms of a Shorten government.

He would be there, he would be supportive and he would score his runs. It was clear that when Viv joined Glamorgan in 1990 he was an inspiration to their younger players. No doubt having been rejected by Somerset, a decision that hurt the proudest of men, he was determined to demonstrate that he could fulfil that role as a mentor and a motivator as well as a runscorer.

More than anything as captain, Pete craved a side that would, amid all his eccentricities, listen to and follow him without too much questioning. This was wishful thinking with an ordinary professional cricket side; it was downright impossible in a team containing Ian and Viv. Holding complete sway in those circumstances could never be an option.</p> \n<p>Towards the end of the season there was the final committee meeting. I saw Pete that evening, eager to know the outcome. \u201cI could have saved them,\u201d he said \u2013 after all, he was the club captain \u2013 \u201cbut I could not bring myself to do it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Now it became ugly, very ugly. Viv and Joel were stunned, especially Viv, who had always had such an emotional tie with the club since 1974. A placard appeared, presumably via Ian, on Pete\u2019s peg in the dressing room bearing the word \u201cJudas\u201d. Unsurprisingly Ian was fuming at the decision and threatening to leave. Meanwhile Viv had long since stopped functioning as the vice-captain \u2013 how could he fulfil that role now? \u2013 and he was trying to make sense of it all.</p> \n<p>At the end of August we arrived at Birmingham for a Sunday League game with a squad of at least 15 players because no one could be sure that Viv and Joel would turn up (they did and between them took four cheap wickets in a six-wicket victory).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0df2298d-c777-4808-aa07-00adf13a010e\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Whenever I found myself batting with Viv Richards he was, of course, a reassuring presence. He did not say much out in the middle but he always engaged with his partner. He did not bat in isolation. There was always the sense of \u201cwe are in this together\u201d, which us lesser mortals obviously appreciated. But he did not like batsmen riding on his back, just hanging in there and relying upon him to do all the scoring. Provided you were alive, active and trying to contribute at the other end he was happy. He did not want any parasites. He did his best to make you feel good, a tricky task since he was usually batting sublimely at the other end. They seemed to bowl so much rubbish to him.</p>\n    <p>Richards could intimidate bowlers in a manner beyond any other player of my experience. Most batsmen are vulnerable on nought but Richards, by his delayed, swaggering entrance, could have the palms of bowlers sweating on a cold day before he had faced a ball. He oozed arrogance, a quality that deserted him when he was beyond the boundary, which made him unusual; most cricketers accurately reflect their character in the way they play. All the bowlers of that generation remember what happened when they were up against Richards \u2013 the same applies with Geoffrey Boycott. They knew, even then, that here was something to pass on to the&nbsp;grandchildren.</p>\n    <p>It was better not to provoke him. At Leicester in 1981 Viv was practising on the outfield on the first morning of the match when the Tannoy opened up. It was Mike Turner, the no-nonsense chief executive of Leicestershire, on the microphone. \u201cCould the Somerset players please refrain from hitting the ball into the advertising boards around the boundary? And that includes you, Mr Richards.\u201d A few of the Leicestershire players winced at this intervention and their worst fears were soon realised. Richards hit 196 out of Somerset\u2019s 356 in a match we won by 10 wickets.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>After that Viv and Joel understandably withdrew for a while; Ian was steaming but obliged to play (after all, he had not been sacked); Pete was feeling the pressure too and, as ever, I was just about the only one talking to both parties, to no good effect.</p> \n<p>The most poignant occasion was in the last Sunday League game of the summer against Derbyshire at Taunton on 14 September. Standing in for Pete as captain was a privilege I could have done without and I can\u2019t quite recall what, if anything, I said beforehand but this was the last game played by Viv, Joel and Ian for Somerset. We won by three wickets; Joel took one for 27, Viv made 55 and Ian 32.

      "body": "<p>Among the myriad skills that are employed in different sports one that is shared by all is risk assessment. Though it sounds like some dark art practised by insurance agents, it is the basic cost-benefit analysis that most competitors make intuitively and upon which all coaches are fixated. Namely, does a given action increase the likelihood of gaining an advantage more than it increases the likelihood of suffering a setback? That is the question a full-back has to ask each time he sprints down the wing. Or a tennis player when she rushes the net.</p> <p>And overall it is this matter that governs how a sport is played: the style, attitude, tactics and strategy. You can see this most clearly with football and cricket, two sports that, aside from team size, have little in common. Yet both have been transformed in recent years, particularly in England, by a new approach to risk.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/sep/07/gareth-southgate-england-build-world-cup-success-spain-nations-league\">Summer must be the start and not an end for Gareth Southgate's England</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If you look, for example, at how the England football team now plays, or attempts to play, and how it played for large parts of the 1980s, 90s and most of this century, they bear little resemblance. For decades the England coaching system was heavily influenced by Charles Hughes, who was the FA\u2019s director of coaching. He advocated a tactical approach known as positions of maximum opportunity, or Pomo, which stipulated that as goals were most often scored from certain parts of the field, it made sense to play the ball as often as possible into those areas. By his risk assessment, doing so increased the danger for the opposition while limiting the threat to his own team.</p> <p>In practice this meant bypassing midfield and kicking the ball long or, to use technical language, sticking it in the mixer. It was a kind of power play that prioritised physical strength and athleticism over ball skills and intricate passing. At its most rudimentary it enabled players of limited technical ability, such as Wimbledon\u2019s John Fashanu, to flourish, while discouraging smaller players, even if they were especially gifted.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A series of foreign coaches changed the way football was thought about and played at the top level in the Premier League</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>With various exceptions it was an ugly era but also an unsuccessful one. What the risk assessment had failed to account for was that it is very difficult for the opposition to score if they don\u2019t have the ball. Stick it in the mixer and there is a 50-50 chance the other side will emerge with the ball and then not give it back. Thus major tournaments were spent chasing the ball and then losing it almost immediately on retrieval. No wonder the England team always looked exhausted.</p> <p>A series of foreign coaches changed the way football was thought about and played at the elite level in the Premier League, and that approach has since been adopted by lower teams and leagues as well as the England manager, Gareth Southgate. His determination to instil respect for possession led <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/06/netherlands-england-nations-league-semi-final-match-report\" title=\"\">England to lose this month to the Netherlands</a> in the semi-final of the Nations League, when defenders tried to control the ball rather than \u201cplay it safe\u201d.</p> <p>Risk can never be eliminated in sport, only dealt with in different ways.

      "bodyText": "Among the myriad skills that are employed in different sports one that is shared by all is risk assessment. Though it sounds like some dark art practised by insurance agents, it is the basic cost-benefit analysis that most competitors make intuitively and upon which all coaches are fixated. Namely, does a given action increase the likelihood of gaining an advantage more than it increases the likelihood of suffering a setback? That is the question a full-back has to ask each time he sprints down the wing. Or a tennis player when she rushes the net. And overall it is this matter that governs how a sport is played: the style, attitude, tactics and strategy. You can see this most clearly with football and cricket, two sports that, aside from team size, have little in common. Yet both have been transformed in recent years, particularly in England, by a new approach to risk. If you look, for example, at how the England football team now plays, or attempts to play, and how it played for large parts of the 1980s, 90s and most of this century, they bear little resemblance. For decades the England coaching system was heavily influenced by Charles Hughes, who was the FA\u2019s director of coaching. He advocated a tactical approach known as positions of maximum opportunity, or Pomo, which stipulated that as goals were most often scored from certain parts of the field, it made sense to play the ball as often as possible into those areas. By his risk assessment, doing so increased the danger for the opposition while limiting the threat to his own team. In practice this meant bypassing midfield and kicking the ball long or, to use technical language, sticking it in the mixer. It was a kind of power play that prioritised physical strength and athleticism over ball skills and intricate passing. At its most rudimentary it enabled players of limited technical ability, such as Wimbledon\u2019s John Fashanu, to flourish, while discouraging smaller players, even if they were especially gifted. With various exceptions it was an ugly era but also an unsuccessful one. What the risk assessment had failed to account for was that it is very difficult for the opposition to score if they don\u2019t have the ball. Stick it in the mixer and there is a 50-50 chance the other side will emerge with the ball and then not give it back. Thus major tournaments were spent chasing the ball and then losing it almost immediately on retrieval. No wonder the England team always looked exhausted. A series of foreign coaches changed the way football was thought about and played at the elite level in the Premier League, and that approach has since been adopted by lower teams and leagues as well as the England manager, Gareth Southgate. His determination to instil respect for possession led England to lose this month to the Netherlands in the semi-final of the Nations League, when defenders tried to control the ball rather than \u201cplay it safe\u201d. Risk can never be eliminated in sport, only dealt with in different ways. In the long term it is Southgate\u2019s assessment that a team used to controlling the ball under pressure will have more chance of winning a World Cup than one that routinely kicks the ball away as if it were a grenade about to explode. England\u2019s performances so far in the Women\u2019s World Cup have shown that Phil Neville has picked up more from Southgate than his penchant for wearing waistcoats. His team also prefer to play out from the back rather than lump it upfield at the earliest opportunity. \u201cThe style is non-negotiable,\u201d Neville said after England\u2019s victory over Japan. Style in one sense is just a means of achieving an end but it is also an aesthetic and it should never be forgotten that we call them spectator sports for a reason: people like to watch creativity in action. The ultimate example of creative possession football was Pep Guardiola\u2019s 2008-12 Barcelona team but a pretty close second is his current Manchester City side. Both have been a joy to watch. Also a joy to behold are the England one\u2011day cricket team, playing in the World Cup at the moment. They, too, have done away with old ideas about risk.

      "body": "<p>Later this week at London\u2019s Southbank Centre, hundreds of people \u2013 mainly men, mainly suited \u2013 will gather in a lecture hall and in conference rooms to debate the medicinal merits of cannabis, with other events in the following days focusing on recreational weed.</p> <p>Missing from the gathering will be many of those who smoke the drug, take it as an oil for their ailments or have felt the force of the law over cannabis prohibition.</p> <p>Widening access to medical cannabis for patients, and how to go about it, will be central to the discussion at Cannabis Europa, the conference at the heart of European Cannabis Week. Since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/11/uk-to-allow-doctors-to-prescribe-cannabis-based-medicine-epilepsy-sajid-javid\" title=\"\">legalisation in the UK in June last year</a>, there has not been one reported NHS prescription for full-extract cannabis oil, because of reluctance within the medical establishment. Nonetheless, a private market has emerged to service dozens if not hundreds of wealthy patients, prompting outrage among campaigners.</p> <p>Figures you would usually associate with politics will stroll through the venues, such as the founder of industry body the Centre for Medicinal Cannabis (CMC), Steve Moore \u2013 a former David Cameron insider \u2013 and its policy lead Blair Gibbs, once an adviser to Boris Johnson as mayor of London. They are considered interlopers by seasoned cannabis activists, and are often the object of their anger on social media.</p> <p>The founder of the Guido Fawkes political website, Paul Staines, who provides public affairs advice to the CMC, may also be in attendance, while the <em>Spectator\u2019s</em> chairman, Andrew Neil, will chair a talk featuring Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb and Tory MP Crispin Blunt, who recently founded the new Conservative drug policy reform group.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If they were in it for helping people, where were they 10 years ago?</p> <footer> <cite>Greg de Hoedt, legalisation campaigner</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It has registered as a limited company with two directors from the Canadian recreational cannabis companies Supreme and Wayland, as accusations abound that the medical debate is something of a Trojan horse for multinationals jostling over future control of the UK\u2019s multibillion-pound illicit cannabis market.</p> <p>Few of the attendees will be stoners and adult patients, and many longtime campaigners who have risked the wrath of the law to supply patients are aggrieved they are being sidelined from what they see as top-down reform dictated by big business \u2013 often funded by tobacco money.</p> <p>Greg de Hoedt \u2013 who vapes cannabis to manage symptoms of Crohn\u2019s disease, which doctors said in 2010 would kill him within five years \u2013 founded the UK Cannabis Social Clubs in 2011 to provide safe spaces for patients and recreational users. He remains sceptical over the recent influx of cannabis entrepreneurs.</p> <p>He believes the establishment has hijacked cannabis, and fears that a future recreational cannabis market dominated by corporate interests may lobby against the right for people to grow their own. \u201cIf they were in it for helping people, where were they 10 years ago when we were banging the drum?\u201d he asks. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely concerning seeing these hard-right figures trying to get involved with cannabis. They\u2019re completely gentrifying it by attempting to persuade lawmakers that homegrown cannabis is unsafe.</p> <p>\u201cI fear we\u2019re going to end up with a commercial cannabis market before people get the right to grow. They care about profit, not the people.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you live in a liberal democracy you\u2019ve got to accept people will set up legal businesses</p> <footer> <cite>Steve Moore, CMC</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>However, the policymakers say the traditional campaigners had no plan, and that the politicisation and commercialisation of cannabis is an inevitable consequence of reform.</p> <p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t prepared to deal with this coming,\u201d says Moore, who was chief executive of Cameron\u2019s ill-fated \u201cbig society\u201d initiative and admits to never having used cannabis in his life. \u201cThey weren\u2019t organised, they had no political connections, nor media strategy \u2013 it was all a bit ad hoc. Plus, they\u2019re always having arguments among themselves.\u201d</p> <p>He admits that it is hard for those activist groups to get a seat at the table. \u201cThey\u2019re never going to have the size of these companies. Many are getting involved in the industry instead.\u201d</p> <p>Out of a job after the \u201cbig society\u201d unravelled, Moore helped cannabis enthusiast Paul Birch \u2013 who made more than \u00a3200m from the sale of social network Bebo in 2008 \u2013 to establish a new political party, Cannabis Is Safer Than Alcohol, which fought the 2015 general election.</p> <p>A year later the pair founded Volteface, an organisation to advocate drug reform. Fast-forward two years, and their canny, patient-led campaigning led to the legalisation of medical cannabis in June 2018.</p> <p>However, De Hoedt claims Moore is not interested in patients, nor the small-scale growers who may still be raided, and points to Volteface\u2019s sponsorship by MPX, a multinational cannabis producer.</p> <p>Moore says it would be perfectly reasonable for people to grow small amounts for personal use within a regulated market, and is frank about both Volteface, where he remains an adviser, and the CMC\u2019s business links.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I first got here three years ago, you\u2019d have investor dinners with 15 people in Pall Mall: now there are more than 1,000,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are many companies poised, no doubt.\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately, he argues, public-private partnerships are the best avenue for effective reform. \u201cThe bottom line is, if you live in a liberal democracy you\u2019ve got to accept people will set up legal businesses,\u201d he says. \u201cThey operate in a regulated environment.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Later this week at London\u2019s Southbank Centre, hundreds of people \u2013 mainly men, mainly suited \u2013 will gather in a lecture hall and in conference rooms to debate the medicinal merits of cannabis, with other events in the following days focusing on recreational weed. Missing from the gathering will be many of those who smoke the drug, take it as an oil for their ailments or have felt the force of the law over cannabis prohibition. Widening access to medical cannabis for patients, and how to go about it, will be central to the discussion at Cannabis Europa, the conference at the heart of European Cannabis Week. Since legalisation in the UK in June last year, there has not been one reported NHS prescription for full-extract cannabis oil, because of reluctance within the medical establishment. Nonetheless, a private market has emerged to service dozens if not hundreds of wealthy patients, prompting outrage among campaigners. Figures you would usually associate with politics will stroll through the venues, such as the founder of industry body the Centre for Medicinal Cannabis (CMC), Steve Moore \u2013 a former David Cameron insider \u2013 and its policy lead Blair Gibbs, once an adviser to Boris Johnson as mayor of London. They are considered interlopers by seasoned cannabis activists, and are often the object of their anger on social media. The founder of the Guido Fawkes political website, Paul Staines, who provides public affairs advice to the CMC, may also be in attendance, while the Spectator\u2019s chairman, Andrew Neil, will chair a talk featuring Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb and Tory MP Crispin Blunt, who recently founded the new Conservative drug policy reform group. It has registered as a limited company with two directors from the Canadian recreational cannabis companies Supreme and Wayland, as accusations abound that the medical debate is something of a Trojan horse for multinationals jostling over future control of the UK\u2019s multibillion-pound illicit cannabis market. Few of the attendees will be stoners and adult patients, and many longtime campaigners who have risked the wrath of the law to supply patients are aggrieved they are being sidelined from what they see as top-down reform dictated by big business \u2013 often funded by tobacco money. Greg de Hoedt \u2013 who vapes cannabis to manage symptoms of Crohn\u2019s disease, which doctors said in 2010 would kill him within five years \u2013 founded the UK Cannabis Social Clubs in 2011 to provide safe spaces for patients and recreational users. He remains sceptical over the recent influx of cannabis entrepreneurs. He believes the establishment has hijacked cannabis, and fears that a future recreational cannabis market dominated by corporate interests may lobby against the right for people to grow their own. \u201cIf they were in it for helping people, where were they 10 years ago when we were banging the drum?\u201d he asks. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely concerning seeing these hard-right figures trying to get involved with cannabis. They\u2019re completely gentrifying it by attempting to persuade lawmakers that homegrown cannabis is unsafe. \u201cI fear we\u2019re going to end up with a commercial cannabis market before people get the right to grow. They care about profit, not the people.\u201d However, the policymakers say the traditional campaigners had no plan, and that the politicisation and commercialisation of cannabis is an inevitable consequence of reform. \u201cThey weren\u2019t prepared to deal with this coming,\u201d says Moore, who was chief executive of Cameron\u2019s ill-fated \u201cbig society\u201d initiative and admits to never having used cannabis in his life. \u201cThey weren\u2019t organised, they had no political connections, nor media strategy \u2013 it was all a bit ad hoc. Plus, they\u2019re always having arguments among themselves.\u201d He admits that it is hard for those activist groups to get a seat at the table. \u201cThey\u2019re never going to have the size of these companies. Many are getting involved in the industry instead.\u201d Out of a job after the \u201cbig society\u201d unravelled, Moore helped cannabis enthusiast Paul Birch \u2013 who made more than \u00a3200m from the sale of social network Bebo in 2008 \u2013 to establish a new political party, Cannabis Is Safer Than Alcohol, which fought the 2015 general election. A year later the pair founded Volteface, an organisation to advocate drug reform. Fast-forward two years, and their canny, patient-led campaigning led to the legalisation of medical cannabis in June 2018. However, De Hoedt claims Moore is not interested in patients, nor the small-scale growers who may still be raided, and points to Volteface\u2019s sponsorship by MPX, a multinational cannabis producer. Moore says it would be perfectly reasonable for people to grow small amounts for personal use within a regulated market, and is frank about both Volteface, where he remains an adviser, and the CMC\u2019s business links. \u201cWhen I first got here three years ago, you\u2019d have investor dinners with 15 people in Pall Mall: now there are more than 1,000,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are many companies poised, no doubt.\u201d Ultimately, he argues, public-private partnerships are the best avenue for effective reform. \u201cThe bottom line is, if you live in a liberal democracy you\u2019ve got to accept people will set up legal businesses,\u201d he says. \u201cThey operate in a regulated environment.\u201d",

It\u2019s a kind of five-finger exercise or architectural amuse-bouche, but nearly 20 years on, the landscape has palpably shifted. There\u2019s a growing sense that the notion of architecture as art object has become a bloated irrelevance, despite the Serpentine Gallery putting its pavilion vigorously to work as a space for performance and encounter.</p> <p>Historically the purview of royal or aristocratic patrons with deep pockets and an eye for self-promotion, the architectural cult of the pavilion has a gilded lineage, from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/sep/22/henry-viii-tent-field-of-cloth-of-gold-reconstruction\" title=\"\">Field of the Cloth of Gold</a> to the Serpentine\u2019s more ascetic incarnations.

On paper, it felt very Health Goth: edgy and brooding, yet simultaneously refined and precise. In the flesh it turns out to be an undulating humpback roof of thick, dark fragments of Cumbrian slate supported by a network of toothpick-slim columns. The scaly stone carapace has a distinctly reptilian quality, like a junior Godzilla rearing up from the depths. Stone roofs are a feature of traditional Japanese architecture and the idea of subverting them into a petrified spoil heap clearly appealed to Ishigami.</p> <p>His work is characterised by an apparent feyness and delicacy, undercut by a steely and slightly terrifying rigour. The idea of a solid cloud or \u201clevitating cluster of scattered rocks billowing like a piece of fabric\u201d, as Ishigami describes it, is typically antithetical. A previous project for a workshop at Japan\u2019s Kanagawa Institute of Technology was designed to resemble a birch forest, with 305 columns arranged apparently at random to convey a sense of arboreal intensity. It took two years to work out where each column should go.</p> <p>In all Ishigami\u2019s buildings, effortful things are made to appear effortless. Here, individual pieces of slate, each cut by hand, are painstakingly attached by wire loops to a steel matrix. The overall weight of the roof contrives to anchor and stabilise the composition. A critical aspect of the design was how intimately the pavilion merged with the surrounding landscape, seamlessly conjoining nature and artifice, but this has been rather scuppered by the presence of polycarbonate barriers to tactfully steer visitors around. Inside, it\u2019s cool and gloomy, like a crepuscular wedding marquee.

On the day contracts were exchanged he was told the date had been pushed back to October. \u201cDates were vital for us because we were applying for schools for my daughter and had to be in residence by April for her to be accepted,\u201d says Taylor, who paid \u00a3369,950 for a four-bedroom Persimmon home in Deal, Kent.</p> <p>\u201cMy wife was due to give birth in May and we\u2019d hoped to be settled in time. Moreover, we risked losing our mortgage offer because of the delay.\u201d</p> <p>Taylor agreed to swap his chosen plot for a larger \u00a3379,950 house on the same development which was due to be completed between May and July, in time for his daughter to start school. Two days after he exchanged contracts he was told he and his family might have to wait until the end of October before they could move in. Now he\u2019s been told it could be late November, with building work not expected to start until July. He estimates the delay will cost him \u00a310,500 for temporary rental accommodation.</p> <p>\u201cHad we been informed of the potential delay on the second plot, there is no way that we would have continued with the purchase,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cWe cannot legally terminate our contract so, as our daughter has since been offered a school place, we either have to rent in Deal for an unknown number of months, or face driving six hours a day from our current home to take and collect her from school. Since Persimmon allows us only 14 days to complete the purchase after the home is finished, it makes even a short-term rental almost impossible.\u201d</p> <p>Contracts for new-build homes and the industry-led code of practice that informs them are heavily weighted in favour of the developer. The Consumer Rights Act does not include new builds, giving buyers less protection than high-street shoppers, and each year hundreds of purchasers are left in limbo when a home is not finished in time. They can\u2019t pull out and reclaim their deposit until building works look likely to exceed what\u2019s known as the \u201clong-stop\u201d date \u2013 the final date by which a property can be finished, which is often buried in the small print.</p> <p>This can be up to six months later than the legal completion date cited in the contracts, and the legal completion date is often months later than the estimates given when contracts are exchanged. Most mortgage offers are only valid for three months.</p> <p>While purchasers are legally bound to the developer\u2019s timetable for the exchange and completion of contracts and face substantial penalties if they delay, developers allow themselves generous leeway.</p> <p>A completion date only becomes legally binding when the home is ready and a \u201ccompletion notice\u201d is served, after which purchasers have seven to 10 days to pay up or else face interest charges on the balance.</p> <p>Nor are developers obliged to pay compensation for delays, unless the developer exceeds the \u201clong-stop\u201d date. Purchasers who have to proceed with the sale of their old home after exchanging contracts, or to rearrange a mortgage when their offer expires, can be left heavily out of pocket.</p> <p>Grant and Alexis Ross have spent \u00a314,000 on rent and storage after the completion of their \u00a3400,000 flat in Bristol was delayed by 14 months by Galliard Homes. \u201cWe exchanged contracts in December 2016 and were told completion would be late 2017,\u201d says Grant Ross. \u201cThe long-stop date was 31 December 2018. After many delays, in August 2018 we received an email from the developer\u2019s agent asking us to get our money together for completion in six to eight weeks, so we completed the sale of our old house. However, the flat wasn\u2019t ready and the project director gave us new completion dates on an almost weekly basis, always two to three weeks away.\u201d</p> <p>The completion notice was eventually served in December, but the form was incomplete. The couple moved in at the end of February, having spent five months in hotels and Airbnb accommodation while their furniture racked up charges in storage.</p> <p>\u201cBecause of the constantly changing completion dates we couldn\u2019t rent on a short-term lease,\u201d says Ross. \u201cGalliard refuses to take any responsibility and will not provide any compensation or refund of expenses.\u201d</p> <p>Galliard insists completion was not delayed, despite the estimated dates given in the reservation details, because the completion notice was served in time for the long-stop date. It declines to comment on the incomplete completion notice, which caused another two-month delay, and says that instead of compensation \u201cextensive alterations\u201d requested by the couple were undertaken at no charge. Ross says this was the installation of under-floor heating, which had been promised in the contract but not delivered to any of the flats in the development.</p> <p>Persimmon has similarly declined to compensate the Taylors for the delays, which it blames on unforeseen archaeological works and inclement weather. \u201cWe kept Mr Taylor informed of delays throughout the process,\u201d says the managing director of its south-east division, Tom Wright. \u201cIn January we estimated the build completion date to be 9 August 2019. Mr Taylor accepted this date and instructed his solicitor to exchange contracts. The act of exchanging contracts triggered a letter from our construction team that confirmed the date agreed, but, as required by the Consumer Code for Home Builders, provided a band of dates depending on the stage of construction, which in this instance was 9 August \u2013 31 October 2019.\u201d</p> <p>The company says its contracts do not include a long-stop deadline by which a building must be completed. Instead it cites a \u201ctermination date\u201d after which customers still waiting to move in can cancel their contracts without forfeiting their deposit. \u201cThe termination date becomes effective six months after the estimated build date provided for at exchange of contracts,\u201d adds Wright. \u201cIn this case the termination date is 9 February 2020.\u201d</p> <p>It says it has offered Taylor early cancellation rights as a goodwill offer, but Taylor says it\u2019s too late to start househunting from scratch and be moved by September.</p> <p>Last year Persimmon made a record profit of more than \u00a31bn, partly thanks to the government\u2019s help to buy scheme, which offers interest-free loans to get buyers up the housing ladder. Half of the 16,000 homes it built last year were sold using the subsidy, but allegations of poor quality and unfair leases have prompted a review by the housing secretary, James Brokenshire. Persimmon says new customer service and skills initiatives should improve standards.</p> <p>Campaigners say insist the industry needs an overhaul. \u201cWhen completion is delayed by weeks, even months, costs fall on those purchasing, which is totally unfair,\u201d says Paula Higgins, chief executive of the HomeOwners Alliance.

Despite being in my early 30s when <em>Toy Story</em> came out, I feel like I\u2019ve spent a lifetime with its characters, not least because they\u2019ve been with me throughout my children\u2019s lives.

Voiced in wonderfully dorky tones by Keanu Reeves, Duke is painfully unable to perform any of the daredevil jumps depicted in his TV commercial, something that will strike a chord with anyone who owned an Evel Knievel stunt cycle toy in the 1970s. Then there\u2019s Gabby Gabby (Christina Hendricks), a scary-smiley pullstring doll with a defective voice box who has never known love, and her army of ventriloquist dummies who look like escapees from the 1945 British horror portmanteau <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/16/dead-of-night-philip-french-classic-dvd\" title=\"\">Dead of Night</a></em>. All come together in the deliciously creepy confines of the Second Chance Antiques Store.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a chaotic travelling carnival finds cuddly toys Ducky and Bunny (Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele) tacked to a booth wall, unwinnable prizes in a rigged game that weirdly reminded me of the Flesh Fair cruelty from Steven Spielberg\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/sep/21/1\" title=\"\">AI: Artificial Intelligence</a></em>.</p> <p>And therein, I think, lies the true heart of <em>Toy Story 4</em>. Whereas the previous movies, for all their playful fantasy, were ultimately about very human separation anxiety, this latest instalment focuses more specifically on the abstract issue of what it means to be \u201calive\u201d \u2013 sentient, yet obsolete \u2013 and to take control of your own destiny. For the first time (it seems to me), the story really is about toys <em>per se</em>, rather than about children or their parents.</p> <p>Of course, none of this occurred to me while I was actually watching the film, which (once it found its feet) had me laughing and crying like a child again. The visuals are as astonishing as we have come to expect from Pixar; slapstick gags land with choreographed precision, heartstrings are tugged with practised ease, and dark clouds hover just close enough to remind us all how much we love the light.</p> <p>As the houselights came up (tip: stay to the very end), I was left with a sense of relief that a treasured memory had not been trashed. And now, I\u2019d like it to stop, before anyone gets hurt.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdEB2WIFAvQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vdEB2WIFAvQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdEB2WIFAvQ\">Watch a trailer for Toy Story 4.</a></figcaption> </figure>",

Voiced in wonderfully dorky tones by Keanu Reeves, Duke is painfully unable to perform any of the daredevil jumps depicted in his TV commercial, something that will strike a chord with anyone who owned an Evel Knievel stunt cycle toy in the 1970s. Then there\u2019s Gabby Gabby (Christina Hendricks), a scary-smiley pullstring doll with a defective voice box who has never known love, and her army of ventriloquist dummies who look like escapees from the 1945 British horror portmanteau Dead of Night. All come together in the deliciously creepy confines of the Second Chance Antiques Store. Meanwhile, a chaotic travelling carnival finds cuddly toys Ducky and Bunny (Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele) tacked to a booth wall, unwinnable prizes in a rigged game that weirdly reminded me of the Flesh Fair cruelty from Steven Spielberg\u2019s AI: Artificial Intelligence. And therein, I think, lies the true heart of Toy Story 4. Whereas the previous movies, for all their playful fantasy, were ultimately about very human separation anxiety, this latest instalment focuses more specifically on the abstract issue of what it means to be \u201calive\u201d \u2013 sentient, yet obsolete \u2013 and to take control of your own destiny. For the first time (it seems to me), the story really is about toys per se, rather than about children or their parents. Of course, none of this occurred to me while I was actually watching the film, which (once it found its feet) had me laughing and crying like a child again. The visuals are as astonishing as we have come to expect from Pixar; slapstick gags land with choreographed precision, heartstrings are tugged with practised ease, and dark clouds hover just close enough to remind us all how much we love the light. As the houselights came up (tip: stay to the very end), I was left with a sense of relief that a treasured memory had not been trashed. And now, I\u2019d like it to stop, before anyone gets hurt.",

      "body": "<p>This is how it began, and how it would end, on the long pale strand of a Lincolnshire beach in the last hour of sun, the daylight moon small as a kite in the sky. Far below, a child of three was playing by herself with a new tin spade. It was still strangely warm in that autumn of 1929, and she had taken off her plimsolls to feel the day\u2019s heat lingering in the sand beneath her feet. Short fair hair, no coat, blue eyes and dress to match: that was the description later given to the police. She had come out of the house that afternoon and along the short path to the beach with her mother, Mrs Veda Elston. They had already been there for some time, with biscuits in an old tartan tin, digging and sieving the sand. The tide was receding when they arrived, the concussion of waves on the shore gradually quietening as the day wore on; by now the sea was almost half a mile in the distance. In this lull, on their own familiar beach, and so comfortingly close to home, Veda must have let her daughter wander free for a moment. For she did not see what happened next.</p> <p>Someone moved swiftly across the beach and began talking to the little girl. Someone she perhaps knew, because no sounds were heard as they coaxed her away. One minute she was there, barefoot and absorbed, spade in hand, seconds later she was taken off the sands at the village of Chapel St Leonards apparently without anybody noticing at all. Thus was my mother kidnapped.</p> <p>I see the scene again and again, always trying to grasp the unfathomable moment in which she vanished and everything changed. The place where she was playing empties into air; the tide freezes; the beach turns blank. Time stands still on the shore. How many minutes before her absence begins to register, before Veda becomes uneasy and then fearful, before the silence is broken by shouting and rushing to the spot where the spade lies fallen? The waves continue their impervious lapping, gulls drifting on the surface as the afternoon fades. How long before anybody missed my mother?</p> <p>I have the police report of that day. It is scant. Mrs Elston takes her daughter to the beach at or around 2.30pm. Approximately two hours later, the child disappears so fast that she couldn\u2019t have got anywhere near the water. Unable to find her on the sands, Mrs Elston retraces their steps, searching the path and even the house in case she might have found her way home. Neighbours help look for the child. An urgent telegram is sent to the father, who is away for work, summoning him back to Chapel.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The knowledge of her early life came, and went, in waves\u2026 Something would be established, believed, and then washed away</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>All of this is duly reported to the police, but not until the following day; and not, I suspect, by Veda. I hear instead the brusque authority of my grandfather George. Veda appears silent with shock. All she offers, via her husband, is the possibility that the child must have wandered up the beach behind her and out of sight. She herself was sitting on a blanket, knitting or staring dreamily out to sea in the mild afternoon sun, as I imagine it, with one eye on the child, occasionally plying her with biscuits \u2013 until she just slipped out of view. Perhaps the crisis was not immediately apparent. After all, the beach at Chapel was so innocent, like the child; and her little legs could not have carried her far. But then came darkness with no trace, and more stricken searching, before Veda had to spend the first dreadful night alone without her daughter.</p> <p>How could she have disappeared? The beach, to begin with, is completely flat. A broad street of spotless sand, scattered with angel-wing shells, it seems to stretch forever in both directions. There are no coves, dunes or rocks where an adult could hide a child; everything stands in open view.</p> <p>To reach it, you must walk up and over an artificial incline of heaped sand that is supposed to act as a barrier to the sea; a barrier so ineffectual that houses, cattle and villagers have been swept away in historic storms. This little embankment runs for miles along the coastline and from its top people can be seen walking far away in the distance. Tennyson, the Victorian poet born and raised not far from Chapel, was drawn back to it all through his life. \u201cI used to stand on this sand-built ridge,\u201d he wrote in old age, \u201cand think it was the spine-bone of the world!\u201d</p> <p>Veda\u2019s mother once saw Tennyson on Chapel Sands: pressing along against the strident north-easterly winds, black cloak blowing, hat held on in brows-down melancholy.</p> <p>Come over this ridge and even more surprising than the flatness is the way the sand appears to merge with the sea. The beach is tawny brown and so is the brine, because it washes over beds of clay. On a still day they become one vast continuous expanse, an optical illusion only dispelled when a chink of reflected blue sky spangles the water or a sudden gust troubles the surface. Perhaps that stillness slowed the events of the day. Veda did not notice what was happening quickly enough. Nobody scrambled up that ridge in time to spot any hurriedly departing figures. Footsteps muffled by the sand, voices dispersed on the mellow sea air, all it took was a prolonged moment of parental inattention. No commotion. Nobody saw, and perhaps there were few other people there to witness the incident, for it was a weekday afternoon in October. Nor was this yet a crowded beach as it is today in high season. Black-and-white photographs from the 1920s show deserted sands or very occasional hikers in hobnail boots and straw hats buying tea from a hut by the Pulley, as they still call the narrow passage where horses once pulled cargoes of tobacco and paraffin over the ridge into the village.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1ab8972f98af121690c4be0f1bdfcae3f5281f38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ab8972f98af121690c4be0f1bdfcae3f5281f38/0_0_4264_2992/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Betty in a sand hole on Chapel Sands, taken by george elston with his Box Brownie camera\" width=\"1000\" height=\"702\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Betty in a sand hole on Chapel Sands, taken by her father with his Box Brownie camera.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Laura Cumming</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The beach was always Chapel\u2019s livelihood. Boats went out for whiting, people searched for mussels, shrimped in the waves at low tide. Ships sometimes ran aground, stalled in the shallows, their debris washing fruitfully ashore. There might be wood for the fire, treasurable in those days before electricity; and on Sundays people took bags and went coaling. Stranger things turned up too. A ship running guns lost its dangerous cargo at Chapel and soldiers had to be brought in to handle the live ammunition. A case of glassware was shared out among the villagers, not a single piece shattered. And once a crate of grapefruit spilled out across the sands, odd yellow globes never seen before by anyone except Mr Stow, proprietor of Stow\u2019s Stores by the Pulley; where in the world had they come from?</p> <p>All along the sea\u2019s margin, curds of delicate foam arrive on incoming waves. My mother used to hurl them gleefully about, risking her father\u2019s instant reproach. In winter, sea-driven winds direct from Scandinavia skim sand into the air, stinging the eyes and gritting the mouth. There are spring tides when the water feels warmer than the grey rain spattering its surface and blazing summer days when you can swim forever, it feels, along the unchanging shore. This level strand, with its inviting sea, was the great playground of my mother\u2019s youth. She went there with George, paddling in the shallow froth, clambering about the tide pools, digging holes, drawing in the sand. He took photographs of her with his Box Brownie and even in those monochrome days, they show the beach at Chapel exactly as I knew it too, from the holidays of my own childhood.</p> <p>Photography gives us memories we hardly knew we had: the house where we were born, our infant selves, the embarrassing clothes we once wore. But the camera is also capable of giving us memories we cannot actually have because we were not there in the first place. This rare gift, this strange illusion of deja vu, characterises all of George\u2019s pictures for me. He photographs his daughter on the shore, laughing in a swimming costume I remember as pale lilac, embroidered with a butterfly, though of course I neither saw nor wore it. She sits in front of a bell tent with a kettle brewing on a portable stove, its meagre flame the result of the purple methylated spirits that fuelled it, and I scent that sharp stinging reek. There is a picture of her beaming at the bottom of a gigantic hole which I know George has been excavating all day, the sand damper and colder the deeper he digs into the secret innards of the beach. She is carefully seated inside, in clean clothes for the camera. I am with her, smile pinned to my face too, waiting to be lifted back out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1287cb3763c38b4b7ef8fbabb361c2d76af3bb1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1287cb3763c38b4b7ef8fbabb361c2d76af3bb1c/31_42_2804_4067/689.jpg\" alt=\"Betty on Frank\u2019s shoulders\" width=\"689\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Betty on Frank\u2019s shoulders.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Laura Cumming</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Every beach shot is ecstatic, and almost proverbial: my mother looks happy as a clam. Years of happiness, or so it seems, on Chapel Sands. I particularly love the sight of her perched on the shoulders of a sunbrowned man who bears his load with patient resignation. She is about five, so tanned her eyebrows look white, and the lilac costume is nearly slipping from her thin body as she lifts her arms like a gleeful reveller at a festival. The man\u2019s name is Frank, and he is a friend of George, who is in his customary position behind the camera. But a line of apparently innocuous foam is stealing up behind them. Not many weeks after the picture was taken, Frank fell deeply asleep on an inflatable raft on this beach. The tide stole him away to his fate, a dark disappearance somewhere out in the North Sea.</p> <p>All the beach photographs in the Elston family album were taken by George. He would not yield his Box Brownie to anyone else, which is why he never appears on the shore with his daughter. But on the other hand, neither does Veda. I did not notice these absences as a child, leafing through the illuminated treasury of my mother\u2019s early life, images to go with the stories she told, but of course they strike me every time I look as an adult. George Elston is there, recording the moment, but his wife is not. My mother has not a single memory of going to the beach again with Veda.</p> <p>The photographs in the family album are few and tiny, no larger than a matchbox, in a landscape-shaped book that is barely 10 inches by eight. This modest volume has only 22 pages, yet half of them are completely empty. All my life this puzzled me. For years I thought it was a matter of thrift; but film for a Box Brownie was relatively cheap, even for a poor family like the Elstons. In fact, George appears to be selecting only the best images from many rolls of film for his album; there are rejects in the back, and considerable time passes between one picture and the next. And time is precisely what I should have noticed. There are no photographs of my mother before the age of three. There are none of Veda, George and Betty together, and the whole narrative runs out when she is around the age of 13. One decade in the light, then many black pages.</p> <p>\u201cBetty, Chapel.\u201d This is written in George\u2019s firm hand on the back of these photographs of his daughter. Other people drift in and out of shot, nameless strangers, now forgotten. But she is always given as Betty. Except in one stray image, slipped inside the back cover of the album, never attached, that does not fit anywhere in the sequence. This picture shows my mother as a young child on Chapel Sands, but with a different name on the reverse in an unknown hand. Here she is not called Betty. She is Grace.</p> <p><strong>My mother was born </strong>on 8 August 1926 in the shadow of a windmill in a Lincolnshire village. One month later, she was christened Grace in the parish church. No father is cited on the birth certificate; the child was to be considered fatherless. At the age of three, she was passed to George and Veda Elston, given this new name Betty, and taken to live in Chapel St Leonards. The Elstons were going to be her parents now. Henceforth, she was to be considered lucky.</p> <p>But she did not feel that way. As an adult she began to call herself Elizabeth, having always hated the name Betty, specifically for its associations with George. It was incredible to me, when young, that this abundantly loving woman could so have loathed her father that she would change her own name to be free of his reach. But I knew very little of her story yet, and neither did she. My mother did not see her own birth certificate until she was 40. She did not know that she was once called Grace, had no sense of her existence before the age of three. The knowledge of her early life came \u2013 and went \u2013 in waves over the years. Something would be established, believed, and then washed away; then it would happen all over again, the arriving wave disrupting the old in a kind of tidal confusion. Even now, in her 90s, she has no idea precisely how or why she ceased to be Grace, but I know that it was before she ever reached the home of Veda and George. She stopped searching long ago; now I must discover the truth of her story.</p> <p>The name they will be calling in desperation on the sands that day is Betty \u2013 Betty Elston, three-year-old daughter of the Elstons at No 1 St Leonard\u2019s Villas, who are well known in Chapel. George Maybrook Elston \u2013 he always signs his name in full, with some flourish \u2013 is a travelling salesman. He sells industrial textile soaps, setting off by train every Monday morning with a suitcase of samples to extol to factory managers across England all the way through until Friday. He is away on that autumn day in 1929. So Veda must try to reach him wherever he is, perhaps in Leeds or Liverpool in a commercial hotel. They do not have a telephone, and neither do any of their neighbours, so she goes to the post office at the back of Stow\u2019s Stores to send that frantic telegram. Mrs Stow offers comfort; Mr Stow gathers other villagers to join in the search. I suspect they have private thoughts about where she is, and even who might have taken her. Perhaps that is why the police are not involved until the following day. But their guesses will all be wrong.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0d5370a3294ab2a707dc716303736b7283269c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0d5370a3294ab2a707dc716303736b7283269c5/0_0_3704_2616/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George and Veda as a young married couple outside Bradford in 1913.

If the missing child left any footprints in the sand they led nowhere, or faded out too soon. If there were witnesses who could offer something more useful than the colour of Betty\u2019s dress then they never spoke up, even when the policeman called. The first day passed with no news of her, and then another; by which stage the police could surely offer only dwindling reassurance. Three more days of agony followed. And then Betty was discovered, unharmed and dressed in brand-new clothes \u2013 now red, as if through some curious Doppler shift \u2013 in a house not 12 miles from the shore.</p> <p>My mother has no memory of these events. Nobody ever spoke of them at home, in Chapel St Leonards or anywhere else. It was another half-century and more before she even learned of the kidnap.</p> <p><strong>The dead may be invisible</strong>, but they are not absent; so writes St Augustine. We carry their influence, their attitudes, their genes. Their behaviour may form or deform our own. The actions of all these villagers have affected my mother right up to this day, most particularly the behaviour of her parents and those who took her. Her life began with a false start and continued with a long chain of deceptions, abetted by acts of communal silence so determined they have continued into my life too. The mystery of what happened, how it changed her, and her own children, has run through my days ever since I first heard of the incident on the beach 30 years ago. Then it seemed to me that all we needed was more evidence to solve it, more knowledge in the form of documents, letters, hard facts. But to my surprise the truth turns out to pivot on images as much as words. To discover it has involved looking harder, looking closer, paying more attention to the smallest of visual details \u2013 the clues in a dress, the distinctive slant of a copperplate hand, the miniature faces in the family album.</p> <p>I picture each scene, as we all do with puzzles, assembling the evidence in the mind\u2019s eye.

      "bodyText": "This is how it began, and how it would end, on the long pale strand of a Lincolnshire beach in the last hour of sun, the daylight moon small as a kite in the sky. Far below, a child of three was playing by herself with a new tin spade. It was still strangely warm in that autumn of 1929, and she had taken off her plimsolls to feel the day\u2019s heat lingering in the sand beneath her feet. Short fair hair, no coat, blue eyes and dress to match: that was the description later given to the police. She had come out of the house that afternoon and along the short path to the beach with her mother, Mrs Veda Elston. They had already been there for some time, with biscuits in an old tartan tin, digging and sieving the sand. The tide was receding when they arrived, the concussion of waves on the shore gradually quietening as the day wore on; by now the sea was almost half a mile in the distance. In this lull, on their own familiar beach, and so comfortingly close to home, Veda must have let her daughter wander free for a moment. For she did not see what happened next. Someone moved swiftly across the beach and began talking to the little girl. Someone she perhaps knew, because no sounds were heard as they coaxed her away. One minute she was there, barefoot and absorbed, spade in hand, seconds later she was taken off the sands at the village of Chapel St Leonards apparently without anybody noticing at all. Thus was my mother kidnapped. I see the scene again and again, always trying to grasp the unfathomable moment in which she vanished and everything changed. The place where she was playing empties into air; the tide freezes; the beach turns blank. Time stands still on the shore. How many minutes before her absence begins to register, before Veda becomes uneasy and then fearful, before the silence is broken by shouting and rushing to the spot where the spade lies fallen? The waves continue their impervious lapping, gulls drifting on the surface as the afternoon fades. How long before anybody missed my mother? I have the police report of that day. It is scant. Mrs Elston takes her daughter to the beach at or around 2.30pm. Approximately two hours later, the child disappears so fast that she couldn\u2019t have got anywhere near the water. Unable to find her on the sands, Mrs Elston retraces their steps, searching the path and even the house in case she might have found her way home. Neighbours help look for the child. An urgent telegram is sent to the father, who is away for work, summoning him back to Chapel. All of this is duly reported to the police, but not until the following day; and not, I suspect, by Veda. I hear instead the brusque authority of my grandfather George. Veda appears silent with shock. All she offers, via her husband, is the possibility that the child must have wandered up the beach behind her and out of sight. She herself was sitting on a blanket, knitting or staring dreamily out to sea in the mild afternoon sun, as I imagine it, with one eye on the child, occasionally plying her with biscuits \u2013 until she just slipped out of view. Perhaps the crisis was not immediately apparent. After all, the beach at Chapel was so innocent, like the child; and her little legs could not have carried her far. But then came darkness with no trace, and more stricken searching, before Veda had to spend the first dreadful night alone without her daughter. How could she have disappeared? The beach, to begin with, is completely flat. A broad street of spotless sand, scattered with angel-wing shells, it seems to stretch forever in both directions. There are no coves, dunes or rocks where an adult could hide a child; everything stands in open view. To reach it, you must walk up and over an artificial incline of heaped sand that is supposed to act as a barrier to the sea; a barrier so ineffectual that houses, cattle and villagers have been swept away in historic storms. This little embankment runs for miles along the coastline and from its top people can be seen walking far away in the distance. Tennyson, the Victorian poet born and raised not far from Chapel, was drawn back to it all through his life. \u201cI used to stand on this sand-built ridge,\u201d he wrote in old age, \u201cand think it was the spine-bone of the world!\u201d Veda\u2019s mother once saw Tennyson on Chapel Sands: pressing along against the strident north-easterly winds, black cloak blowing, hat held on in brows-down melancholy. Come over this ridge and even more surprising than the flatness is the way the sand appears to merge with the sea. The beach is tawny brown and so is the brine, because it washes over beds of clay. On a still day they become one vast continuous expanse, an optical illusion only dispelled when a chink of reflected blue sky spangles the water or a sudden gust troubles the surface. Perhaps that stillness slowed the events of the day. Veda did not notice what was happening quickly enough. Nobody scrambled up that ridge in time to spot any hurriedly departing figures. Footsteps muffled by the sand, voices dispersed on the mellow sea air, all it took was a prolonged moment of parental inattention. No commotion. Nobody saw, and perhaps there were few other people there to witness the incident, for it was a weekday afternoon in October. Nor was this yet a crowded beach as it is today in high season. Black-and-white photographs from the 1920s show deserted sands or very occasional hikers in hobnail boots and straw hats buying tea from a hut by the Pulley, as they still call the narrow passage where horses once pulled cargoes of tobacco and paraffin over the ridge into the village. The beach was always Chapel\u2019s livelihood. Boats went out for whiting, people searched for mussels, shrimped in the waves at low tide. Ships sometimes ran aground, stalled in the shallows, their debris washing fruitfully ashore. There might be wood for the fire, treasurable in those days before electricity; and on Sundays people took bags and went coaling. Stranger things turned up too. A ship running guns lost its dangerous cargo at Chapel and soldiers had to be brought in to handle the live ammunition. A case of glassware was shared out among the villagers, not a single piece shattered. And once a crate of grapefruit spilled out across the sands, odd yellow globes never seen before by anyone except Mr Stow, proprietor of Stow\u2019s Stores by the Pulley; where in the world had they come from? All along the sea\u2019s margin, curds of delicate foam arrive on incoming waves. My mother used to hurl them gleefully about, risking her father\u2019s instant reproach. In winter, sea-driven winds direct from Scandinavia skim sand into the air, stinging the eyes and gritting the mouth. There are spring tides when the water feels warmer than the grey rain spattering its surface and blazing summer days when you can swim forever, it feels, along the unchanging shore. This level strand, with its inviting sea, was the great playground of my mother\u2019s youth. She went there with George, paddling in the shallow froth, clambering about the tide pools, digging holes, drawing in the sand. He took photographs of her with his Box Brownie and even in those monochrome days, they show the beach at Chapel exactly as I knew it too, from the holidays of my own childhood. Photography gives us memories we hardly knew we had: the house where we were born, our infant selves, the embarrassing clothes we once wore. But the camera is also capable of giving us memories we cannot actually have because we were not there in the first place. This rare gift, this strange illusion of deja vu, characterises all of George\u2019s pictures for me. He photographs his daughter on the shore, laughing in a swimming costume I remember as pale lilac, embroidered with a butterfly, though of course I neither saw nor wore it. She sits in front of a bell tent with a kettle brewing on a portable stove, its meagre flame the result of the purple methylated spirits that fuelled it, and I scent that sharp stinging reek. There is a picture of her beaming at the bottom of a gigantic hole which I know George has been excavating all day, the sand damper and colder the deeper he digs into the secret innards of the beach. She is carefully seated inside, in clean clothes for the camera. I am with her, smile pinned to my face too, waiting to be lifted back out. Every beach shot is ecstatic, and almost proverbial: my mother looks happy as a clam. Years of happiness, or so it seems, on Chapel Sands. I particularly love the sight of her perched on the shoulders of a sunbrowned man who bears his load with patient resignation. She is about five, so tanned her eyebrows look white, and the lilac costume is nearly slipping from her thin body as she lifts her arms like a gleeful reveller at a festival. The man\u2019s name is Frank, and he is a friend of George, who is in his customary position behind the camera. But a line of apparently innocuous foam is stealing up behind them. Not many weeks after the picture was taken, Frank fell deeply asleep on an inflatable raft on this beach. The tide stole him away to his fate, a dark disappearance somewhere out in the North Sea. All the beach photographs in the Elston family album were taken by George. He would not yield his Box Brownie to anyone else, which is why he never appears on the shore with his daughter. But on the other hand, neither does Veda. I did not notice these absences as a child, leafing through the illuminated treasury of my mother\u2019s early life, images to go with the stories she told, but of course they strike me every time I look as an adult. George Elston is there, recording the moment, but his wife is not. My mother has not a single memory of going to the beach again with Veda. The photographs in the family album are few and tiny, no larger than a matchbox, in a landscape-shaped book that is barely 10 inches by eight. This modest volume has only 22 pages, yet half of them are completely empty. All my life this puzzled me. For years I thought it was a matter of thrift; but film for a Box Brownie was relatively cheap, even for a poor family like the Elstons. In fact, George appears to be selecting only the best images from many rolls of film for his album; there are rejects in the back, and considerable time passes between one picture and the next. And time is precisely what I should have noticed. There are no photographs of my mother before the age of three. There are none of Veda, George and Betty together, and the whole narrative runs out when she is around the age of 13. One decade in the light, then many black pages. \u201cBetty, Chapel.\u201d This is written in George\u2019s firm hand on the back of these photographs of his daughter. Other people drift in and out of shot, nameless strangers, now forgotten. But she is always given as Betty. Except in one stray image, slipped inside the back cover of the album, never attached, that does not fit anywhere in the sequence. This picture shows my mother as a young child on Chapel Sands, but with a different name on the reverse in an unknown hand. Here she is not called Betty. She is Grace. My mother was born on 8 August 1926 in the shadow of a windmill in a Lincolnshire village. One month later, she was christened Grace in the parish church. No father is cited on the birth certificate; the child was to be considered fatherless. At the age of three, she was passed to George and Veda Elston, given this new name Betty, and taken to live in Chapel St Leonards. The Elstons were going to be her parents now. Henceforth, she was to be considered lucky. But she did not feel that way. As an adult she began to call herself Elizabeth, having always hated the name Betty, specifically for its associations with George. It was incredible to me, when young, that this abundantly loving woman could so have loathed her father that she would change her own name to be free of his reach. But I knew very little of her story yet, and neither did she. My mother did not see her own birth certificate until she was 40. She did not know that she was once called Grace, had no sense of her existence before the age of three. The knowledge of her early life came \u2013 and went \u2013 in waves over the years. Something would be established, believed, and then washed away; then it would happen all over again, the arriving wave disrupting the old in a kind of tidal confusion. Even now, in her 90s, she has no idea precisely how or why she ceased to be Grace, but I know that it was before she ever reached the home of Veda and George. She stopped searching long ago; now I must discover the truth of her story. The name they will be calling in desperation on the sands that day is Betty \u2013 Betty Elston, three-year-old daughter of the Elstons at No 1 St Leonard\u2019s Villas, who are well known in Chapel. George Maybrook Elston \u2013 he always signs his name in full, with some flourish \u2013 is a travelling salesman. He sells industrial textile soaps, setting off by train every Monday morning with a suitcase of samples to extol to factory managers across England all the way through until Friday. He is away on that autumn day in 1929. So Veda must try to reach him wherever he is, perhaps in Leeds or Liverpool in a commercial hotel. They do not have a telephone, and neither do any of their neighbours, so she goes to the post office at the back of Stow\u2019s Stores to send that frantic telegram. Mrs Stow offers comfort; Mr Stow gathers other villagers to join in the search. I suspect they have private thoughts about where she is, and even who might have taken her. Perhaps that is why the police are not involved until the following day. But their guesses will all be wrong. The hue and cry ran along the coast from one village to the next, from Chapel to Ingoldmells and Anderby Creek. If the missing child left any footprints in the sand they led nowhere, or faded out too soon. If there were witnesses who could offer something more useful than the colour of Betty\u2019s dress then they never spoke up, even when the policeman called. The first day passed with no news of her, and then another; by which stage the police could surely offer only dwindling reassurance. Three more days of agony followed. And then Betty was discovered, unharmed and dressed in brand-new clothes \u2013 now red, as if through some curious Doppler shift \u2013 in a house not 12 miles from the shore. My mother has no memory of these events. Nobody ever spoke of them at home, in Chapel St Leonards or anywhere else. It was another half-century and more before she even learned of the kidnap. The dead may be invisible, but they are not absent; so writes St Augustine. We carry their influence, their attitudes, their genes. Their behaviour may form or deform our own. The actions of all these villagers have affected my mother right up to this day, most particularly the behaviour of her parents and those who took her. Her life began with a false start and continued with a long chain of deceptions, abetted by acts of communal silence so determined they have continued into my life too. The mystery of what happened, how it changed her, and her own children, has run through my days ever since I first heard of the incident on the beach 30 years ago. Then it seemed to me that all we needed was more evidence to solve it, more knowledge in the form of documents, letters, hard facts. But to my surprise the truth turns out to pivot on images as much as words. To discover it has involved looking harder, looking closer, paying more attention to the smallest of visual details \u2013 the clues in a dress, the distinctive slant of a copperplate hand, the miniature faces in the family album. I picture each scene, as we all do with puzzles, assembling the evidence in the mind\u2019s eye. But the habit is also involuntary. My mother is an artist, my father was an artist; it is the family profession. Every evening, after teaching at Edinburgh College of Art, my father would draw for hours in his sketchbook. These drawings took the form of lyrical abstractions of the golden mean, the cuneiform alphabet, the newly revealed wonders of the subatomic particle, occasionally a couple of highwire acrobats for his children. But recollections of the day would materialise too: a student at an easel, a bowl of spaghetti cooked by my mother, and all conceived within frames; just as her doodles during a phone call would appear as finished tableaux.

The long curve of John Nash\u2019s elegant crescent rises high above, like a cliff face, dark figures silhouetted against the glowing windows of shops far below. It could be London now \u2013 bar the kindly constable shepherding pedestrians across the road \u2013 yet this is the scene nearly 100 years ago.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.redfern-gallery.com/artists/94-claude-flight/\" title=\"\">Claude Flight</a> used only blue, black and red \u2013 plus a flash of yellow for the bus hoarding that reads <em>Speed</em>, or would do if the last letter wasn\u2019t rushing out of sight \u2013 to picture the exhilarating atmosphere of late-night shopping in the modern city in 1922. His linocut is superb: all graphic zip and register, curves playing against rectangles, contrasting two of the medium\u2019s defining characteristics \u2013 incisive linearity against soft, muzzy colour. It is one of this show\u2019s sharpest masterworks.</p> <p>In the annals of printmaking, the linocut doesn\u2019t have much status (around floor level, you might say, compared to lithograph or etching). This is partly to do with its very short history. Linoleum itself was only developed in the 1860s, and the earliest artists to come up with the idea of cutting lines into it with a gouge or blade were German expressionists around 1905 and Russian constructivists about 10 years later.</p> <p>Flight made his first prints in 1919, and fervently believed in the linocut as a democratic medium for the working classes. The material was readily available and cheap as chips, if not quite as thrifty as potato-cuts. In those days you could buy lino by the bale and cut it into hundreds of printmaking tiles. The method was less complex than etching, the surface more tractable than wood or metal. Cut the lino, roll with colour and press down. Who hasn\u2019t a folk memory, perhaps from childhood, of lifting it carefully back up to reveal the gorgeously saturated image?</p> <p>Flight by name and nature: Claude was always sending aeroplanes into the air in his prints, speeding, whirling, jetting upwards <a href=\"https://www.futurismo.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/flight20160815_2.jpg\" title=\"\">in arrowhead formats</a> that mimic, in their way, the triangular bevels of the gouge he used to cut the lino.

Even his colours soar. He was lino\u2019s tireless pioneer in Britain, writing manuals, organising travelling exhibitions, teaching the medium at the famous <a href=\"https://www.artrepublic.com/articles/456-lino-cutting-and-the-grosvenor-school-of-modern-art.html/\" title=\"\">Grosvenor School of Modern Art</a>, where students could apply without any qualifications to study art for as long as they liked.

      "bodyText": "A bus hurtles down Regent Street in the blue haze of dusk. It seems to bend away from the eye on the fast corner towards Piccadilly Circus. The long curve of John Nash\u2019s elegant crescent rises high above, like a cliff face, dark figures silhouetted against the glowing windows of shops far below. It could be London now \u2013 bar the kindly constable shepherding pedestrians across the road \u2013 yet this is the scene nearly 100 years ago. Claude Flight used only blue, black and red \u2013 plus a flash of yellow for the bus hoarding that reads Speed, or would do if the last letter wasn\u2019t rushing out of sight \u2013 to picture the exhilarating atmosphere of late-night shopping in the modern city in 1922. His linocut is superb: all graphic zip and register, curves playing against rectangles, contrasting two of the medium\u2019s defining characteristics \u2013 incisive linearity against soft, muzzy colour. It is one of this show\u2019s sharpest masterworks. In the annals of printmaking, the linocut doesn\u2019t have much status (around floor level, you might say, compared to lithograph or etching). This is partly to do with its very short history. Linoleum itself was only developed in the 1860s, and the earliest artists to come up with the idea of cutting lines into it with a gouge or blade were German expressionists around 1905 and Russian constructivists about 10 years later. Flight made his first prints in 1919, and fervently believed in the linocut as a democratic medium for the working classes. The material was readily available and cheap as chips, if not quite as thrifty as potato-cuts. In those days you could buy lino by the bale and cut it into hundreds of printmaking tiles. The method was less complex than etching, the surface more tractable than wood or metal. Cut the lino, roll with colour and press down. Who hasn\u2019t a folk memory, perhaps from childhood, of lifting it carefully back up to reveal the gorgeously saturated image? Flight by name and nature: Claude was always sending aeroplanes into the air in his prints, speeding, whirling, jetting upwards in arrowhead formats that mimic, in their way, the triangular bevels of the gouge he used to cut the lino. In Swing Boats, he sends the pleasure-seekers soaring upwards in radial arcs, bright blue on grey. Even his colours soar. He was lino\u2019s tireless pioneer in Britain, writing manuals, organising travelling exhibitions, teaching the medium at the famous Grosvenor School of Modern Art, where students could apply without any qualifications to study art for as long as they liked. Flight was mentor to most of the artists in this show. For Cutting Edge is really a paean to the Grosvenor School, specifically Flight\u2019s co-founder Cyril Power. Power is the genius of the London Underground, with his spectral image of the long spiral staircases winding down below the city streets, and his terrific linocut of a District Line compartment taking the bend, sharp-kneed passengers clutching their identical newspapers, strap-hangers swinging sideways. Lifts, from 1930, gets the downward plunge through the cylindrical shaft in little more than a few variegated stripes, green and red on cream: nearly abstract. It is the same with skating, car-racing, the centrifugal force of the merry-go-round at Wembley; Power could imply all kinds of modern speed with beautifully simplified geometries. Look out especially for his commuters, descending the rolling escalators of the new underground stations like a chorus line of identical Cecil B DeMille dancers. As with so many other gripping art shows this year, from Natalia Goncharova to Lee Krasner to Dorothea Tanning, the revelations here are almost all women. The Australian artist Ethel Spowers uses the medium to catch momentary effects \u2013 a gust of wind scattering sheets of paper, rain glittering on a pavement, the sheen on a red London postbox. The daughter of a newspaper proprietor, she made a very subtle linocut of crowds behind the front pages of a special edition, disappearing into the distance like diaphanous white sails. Her contemporary, the Swiss-born artist Lill Tschudi, showed equal acuity. Her linocut Jeu de Boules is immediately evocative of those cliques of Frenchmen lingering beneath trees, boules cradled behind their backs as they ponder the pitch. Tschudi was fascinated by the ways of men. Workmen up ladders, waiters flapping like large crows between tables, a pair of linesmen fixing telegraph wires that bristle like cats\u2019 whiskers around them \u2013 a print made when she was barely 21. Above all, Sybil Andrews \u2013 her full name frequently lost in the joint pseudonym Andrews-Power, marking works made in partnership with Cyril \u2013 who goes even closer to seductive abstraction in Concert Hall (1929), her terrific image of theatre stalls far below the immense sweeping curves of the upper circles. The atmosphere of limelight and perfume is exquisitely conveyed in the soft flocking of the powdery print.

      "body": "<p>Any sex play by David Mamet comes with \u201ccontroversial\u201d padlocked to it: the teasing ambivalence of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2004/apr/23/theatre\" title=\"\">Oleanna</a></em> in 1992 ensured that. But his post-Weinstein drama is not provocative: it\u2019s just a feeble fizzle.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bitterwheatplay.com/\" title=\"\">Bitter Wheat</a></strong> fails on every front. It is advertised as farce but, as directed by Mamet himself, is too flaccid to raise more than a couple of laughs. The Hollywood mogul who tries to bamboozle a young actress into bed with the promise of stardom is so self-evidently a creep (\u201cYou\u2019re a Korean and you can\u2019t give me a massage\u201d) that it\u2019s hard to believe he ever took anyone in. John Malkovich paws, roars and unzippers his way around the stage: he is a grisly force, but he is not written as a human being; he might have escaped from <em>Where the Wild Things Are</em>. By making him merely a monster the play lets itself lazily off the hook of real controversy: the systematic and systemic abuse of power.</p> <p>Plenty else is wrong. The plot takes a bonkers sudden leap in the second half. The satire on the film industry, which Mamet took to pieces scathingly in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/oct/05/speed-the-plow-lindsay-lohan-review-playhouse-london-schiff-lindsay-posner\" title=\"\">Speed-the-Plow</a></em>, is desultory: all juries are rigged; all critics bought off. This is not only a waste of Malkovich\u2019s talent but of Ioanna Kimbook, impressively poised in the limply written part of the young actress. And of Doon Mackichan, coolly persuasive as his inscrutable \u2013 on message or offside? \u2013 assistant, ticking around like a deathwatch beetle. An evening is too precious to give up to watching this. Not so much wheat as chaff.</p> <p>What a relief to turn to the rich rest of the week. Now at last we know what Samuel Taylor Coleridge was really on about in <em>Kubla Khan</em>. His stately pleasure dome is perfectly evoked by Giffords\u2019 little top: in it, audiences feast on honey dew and drink the milk of paradise.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dec68e0dda5ed62106e81bd0001a6cf304d80465\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dec68e0dda5ed62106e81bd0001a6cf304d80465/0_167_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"ringmaster Michael Fletcher and company in Xanadu.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Sweetness, skill and spangle\u2019: ringmaster Michael Fletcher and company in Xanadu.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gem Hall</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Far removed from the fluorescent contortions of Cirque du Soleil, Giffords mingles sweetness, skill and spangle. Crucially, director Cal McCrystal weaves what could be merely a string of acts into a free-flowing story. In <strong>Xanadu</strong> he has found the perfect vessel. Coleridge\u2019s mazy motion poem provides a title and 1970s psychedelia supplies mood and music. The experience is complete. The sweet tent serves sherbet fountains.

      "bodyText": "Any sex play by David Mamet comes with \u201ccontroversial\u201d padlocked to it: the teasing ambivalence of Oleanna in 1992 ensured that. But his post-Weinstein drama is not provocative: it\u2019s just a feeble fizzle. Bitter Wheat fails on every front. It is advertised as farce but, as directed by Mamet himself, is too flaccid to raise more than a couple of laughs. The Hollywood mogul who tries to bamboozle a young actress into bed with the promise of stardom is so self-evidently a creep (\u201cYou\u2019re a Korean and you can\u2019t give me a massage\u201d) that it\u2019s hard to believe he ever took anyone in. John Malkovich paws, roars and unzippers his way around the stage: he is a grisly force, but he is not written as a human being; he might have escaped from Where the Wild Things Are. By making him merely a monster the play lets itself lazily off the hook of real controversy: the systematic and systemic abuse of power. Plenty else is wrong. The plot takes a bonkers sudden leap in the second half. The satire on the film industry, which Mamet took to pieces scathingly in Speed-the-Plow, is desultory: all juries are rigged; all critics bought off. This is not only a waste of Malkovich\u2019s talent but of Ioanna Kimbook, impressively poised in the limply written part of the young actress. And of Doon Mackichan, coolly persuasive as his inscrutable \u2013 on message or offside? \u2013 assistant, ticking around like a deathwatch beetle. An evening is too precious to give up to watching this. Not so much wheat as chaff. What a relief to turn to the rich rest of the week. Now at last we know what Samuel Taylor Coleridge was really on about in Kubla Khan. His stately pleasure dome is perfectly evoked by Giffords\u2019 little top: in it, audiences feast on honey dew and drink the milk of paradise. Far removed from the fluorescent contortions of Cirque du Soleil, Giffords mingles sweetness, skill and spangle. Crucially, director Cal McCrystal weaves what could be merely a string of acts into a free-flowing story. In Xanadu he has found the perfect vessel. Coleridge\u2019s mazy motion poem provides a title and 1970s psychedelia supplies mood and music. The experience is complete. The sweet tent serves sherbet fountains. Performers have headbands, granny specs, flowers in their abundant hair, flared jeans in two-tone denim. The interval is announced by performers pointing: \u201cWay out, man!\u201d The action is joyfully twirled around by Michael Fletcher \u2013 holding the Liverpudlian line with saucy tunefulness, so that one moment of wonder \u2013 comic or hair-raising \u2013 rolls into another as in a pot-induced dream.

      "bodyText": "More than two thirds of parents don\u2019t know how much exercise their child needs to do to stay healthy, new research has revealed. Official NHS guidance states that children aged five to 18 should do an hour of exercise every day, but 68% of UK adults didn\u2019t know this or thought the target was lower. The survey of 2,000 adults, from YouGov for the Youth Sport Trust (YST), found that only a quarter knew the recommended exercise time for young people, and on average people thought it was 46 minutes. YST chief executive Ali Oliver said: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a worrying trend in recent years of a decline in young people\u2019s physical activity, and a squeeze on time allocated to good quality physical education.\u201d Last year it was reported that pupils were being taken out of PE lessons to give them more time for exam preparation, and 38% of secondary school teachers said PE time for 14- to 16-year-olds had dropped in the past year. Meanwhile, figures from Sport England showed only 17.5% of children are hitting the 60-minute target daily. They also revealed a disparity between children from different economic backgrounds, with 39% of those from the poorest families doing less than 30 minutes of exercise a day, compared with 26% from richer families. This week thousands of schools will come together to celebrate YST National School Sport Week, with the aim of promoting the importance of exercise and the benefits it has on young people. Ben Smith, the runner who completed 401 marathons in 401 days in 2016, is backing the initiative. \u201cMy experience of PE at school was scary,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like I wasn\u2019t good enough, like I would never fit in, that I wouldn\u2019t enjoy it and I put so many barriers in place as an excuse not to exercise. Having found sport later in life, I can now see the power it has not only to build a person\u2019s soul but also the benefits it has on confidence, self-esteem and our overall mental wellbeing. It\u2019s vitally important that every young person has opportunity to enjoy what sport has to offer.\u201d",

She used unskinny models <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/sep/27/fashion-health-and-wellbeing\" title=\"\">Crystal Renn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/oct/24/lara-stone-model-fashion-vogue-david-walliams\" title=\"\">Lara Stone</a>, and did a cover with the blonde, mainstream-looking model Carolyn Murphy prancing around with Andre J, a black transgender model in a dress and a beard. \u201cWould Anna Wintour ever allow such a thing?\u201d asked the American website <a href=\"https://jezebel.com/\" title=\"\">Jezebel</a> at the time.</p> <p>I have brought the current issue of French<em> Vogue</em> with me and we flick through it together. All the models are the exact same skinniness. \u201cI do not like this,\u201d she says. \u201cI like older women. I like bigger girls. I like black women. I did everything first. But people forget, because people forget everything. I feel totally comfortable with everyone. It is my strength, to be open-minded, always.\u201d</p> <p>It does seem to be true \u2013 she is even interested in my red handbag, which is made of fake leather, cost about \u00a350 from a small animal-friendly brand she\u2019s never heard of, and is bursting at the seams \u201cbecause you put too much stuff in it,\u201d she says, as if she\u2019s my mum.</p> <p>After too many years spent reading all those books about how to be chic like a Frenchwoman and hating them so much I\u2019d feel compelled to go straight out and buy one about how to date like them, too, and then how to raise children who eat like French enfants, I feel I should be expert in how to be an insouciant yet glamorous Parisian \u2013 except it hasn\u2019t worked at all. I am not remotely chic. My love life is so English it\u2019s practically Chaucerian. My child subsists on potatoes. So I want to ask this most Parisienne of Parisiennes for her secrets \u2013 can she make me chic? I have this scarf, you see, and every time I tie it in a knot it doesn\u2019t look right. I ask her to tie it better on me, but she takes it off me and ties it better on herself \u2013 by not tying it at all.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e4dc2603c603c541d2182e879996c08b0c65b6c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4dc2603c603c541d2182e879996c08b0c65b6c0/1141_747_2846_5606/508.jpg\" alt=\"Carine Roitfeld wears shirt by Balenciaga; skirt by Tom Ford; shoes by Manolo Blahnik; ankle bracelets by Venyx.\" width=\"508\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carine Roitfeld wears shirt by Balenciaga; skirt by Tom Ford; shoes by Manolo Blahnik; ankle bracelets by Venyx.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Swirc/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cNever a knot,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I learned this from Tom Ford, not France.\u201d She shows me that you either wrap it around your neck once with two long ends dangling down either side of your chest, or you fold it so it\u2019s doubled over and half the length and then thread it through itself a little bit like a tie. Not a knot, you understand.</p> <p>I ask <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/sep/08/carine-roitfeld-fashion-world-interview\" title=\"\">Roitfeld</a>, when I look at a Parisian woman who doesn\u2019t have much makeup on and is in a simple navy sweater and jeans and yet looks stunning, what is she spending her money on. What has she paid for that I can\u2019t see? Is it a dermatologist? Roitfeld nods \u2013 I have hit the nail on the head.</p> <p>\u201cTo be beautiful costs so much money,\u201d she agrees. \u201cFor something you don\u2019t see.\u201d She favours the aesthetician <a href=\"https://www.herveherau.com/\" title=\"\">Herv\u00e9 Herau</a> for her own skin treatments, which she suggests are just a bit of cream, really. She is not keen on younger women getting Botox at all, while she thinks older women often overdo it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to name names but there are some who can\u2019t move their faces any more. Like Cher.\u201d Roitfeld also says that French style is quite conservative, so the chicness comes from a certain coolness in attitude, a lack of overt polishedness, as well as the cut of the trenchcoat, the quality of the shoe. But she insists she prefers English style \u201cbecause we are not good at fantasy, French people. In New York you see all this crazy nail art and I love that, too, but we French are more quiet, discreet.\u201d</p> <p>But how, how do I become chic? There must be a way. She looks at me sympathetically. \u201cChic,\u201d replies Carine Roitfeld, \u201cis innate.\u201d</p> <p>Ah.</p> <p>In the years after leaving <em>Vogue</em> in 2011, her son Vladimir worked on convincing her that her name was valuable and that rather than keep only working for other brands she could become one herself. She was surprised, but she trusted him, and gradually they went into business together, launching her bi-annual magazine <em><a href=\"https://www.crfashionbook.com/\" title=\"\">CR Fashion Book</a></em>, her creative talent agency <a href=\"http://crstudio.nyc/\" title=\"\">CR Studio</a>, and now her Carine Roitfeld Parfums, for which she has created her 7 Lovers range, sold exclusively at Net-a-Porter, each perfume is named after a different fantasy lover from her imagination. So there is the English lover, called George, like our royal prince, \u201cYes, like him, your future queen,\u201d she says, suggesting either a language barrier or that she knows something I don\u2019t about Prince William\u2019s son.</p> <p>George the perfume started off quite green, so she added a shot of cannabis and a shot of espresso to the mix, as you do. Then there\u2019s Sebastian, who comes from Buenos Aires and is as dark and troublesome as the tango, and smells spicy and woody and is \u201ca very selfish lover, the fight between life and death is what I want for him, he\u2019s very proud of himself\u201d. So he\u2019s the one you shouldn\u2019t marry, I suggest. \u201cOh maybe you should,\u201d she replies, quite seriously. My Englishness floats around me like virginity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ff99c5a6f722c93d04bbd2daf17a0916ed3b0db4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff99c5a6f722c93d04bbd2daf17a0916ed3b0db4/481_293_3587_2153/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018My kids are well brought up because I was so tough with them\u2019: Julia Roitfeld and Carine Roitfeld at the Celine show, Paris Fashion Week 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018My kids are well brought up because I was so tough with them\u2019: Julia Roitfeld and Carine Roitfeld at the Celine show, Paris Fashion Week 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David M Benett/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her daughter, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/may/25/hottest-french-it-girl-2013\" title=\"\">Julia Restoin Roitfeld</a>, has also been involved, having taken a nude photo of her mother a couple of years ago that they decided to use for her marketing, after checking with Vladimir. \u201cIf he say I can do it, I can do it.\u201d She says the French aren\u2019t hung up on nudity like we are, although when her own Russian father would parade naked around their French apartment during her childhood, the neighbours did sometimes call the police, \u201cbecause they didn\u2019t like to see it in front of their windows. But he didn\u2019t care.\u201d</p> <p>Vladimir also encouraged her to put a Muslim model in a hijab on the cover of her own magazine. The model was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/apr/30/halima-aden-first-model-burkini-sports-illustrated-muslim-hijab\" title=\"\">Halima Aden</a>, a Somali who was born in a refugee camp in Kenya before moving to America as a child, becoming her American school\u2019s homecoming queen and entering Miss Minnesota. Roitfeld saw those photographs, used her on the cover and Aden now has a high-profile modelling career, having now appeared on the cover of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/03/halima-aden-why-a-model-wearing-a-hijab-on-the-cover-of-vogue-matters\" title=\"\">British</a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/03/halima-aden-why-a-model-wearing-a-hijab-on-the-cover-of-vogue-matters\" title=\"\"> Vogue</a>,</em> too.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m thinking about something he say yes you can do this no you can not do this. He gives a balance to me, which I need, because I\u2019m a bit fearless, I can go too far. When I put this girl with the Muslim scarf I was not sure because no one did it before. But he say, \u2018I think it\u2019s you, do it. Even if some people kill you, it\u2019s you, do it. You open minds.\u2019\u201d At this point I realise this went beyond a cultural or fashion decision \u2013 she genuinely thought she might get murdered. \u201cAnd they do kill me, but it\u2019s OK.\u201d</p> <p>Wait, Carine, nobody killed you, you\u2019re still here.

It\u2019s different in different countries. When you\u2019re doing something new, it\u2019s normal to have critics. Every time I did a new thing I get criticised, but funnily I do a new thing because it\u2019s my way of thinking, my way of loving people. I\u2019m very open-minded. This girl was so beautiful, and she wore her scarf, and there are a lot of girls in scarves in fashion now \u2013 you\u2019re not going to put them away from fashion, they\u2019re too big now.\u201d</p> <p>I mention how multicultural British<em> Vogue</em> has become under its new editor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/nov/07/enninful-fronts-up-to-diversity-debate-with-first-british-vogue-cover\" title=\"\">Edward Enninful</a>. It\u2019s been a huge shift. \u201cYes, good! But he took my girl! He take my model! Halima become a huge voice now and great for her. I find other ones. It\u2019s part of the world today.\u201d</p> <p>On the one hand, CR is from a world of French chic that is, to me, impenetrable. On the other, she is really very funny and tells me that she likes makeup best when you only take half of it off at night \u201cso you\u2019ve got black smudged around your eyes the next day, and this is why people think French women are dirty,\u201d and that she doesn\u2019t follow the supermodel maxim about obsessively moisturising on aeroplanes, \u201cbecause I\u2019m always too cold, I just put my big sunglasses on when I land.\u201d Her high-powered morning health routine is composed of the two major nutrients, \u201cespresso and cigarettes\u201d, and she doesn\u2019t like seeing women doing their makeup in their cars, on their way to work. Because it\u2019s vulgar? \u201cBecause it\u2019s dangerous!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fbe6e6a4e36b3a59350076f3802c56e942a1b73e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbe6e6a4e36b3a59350076f3802c56e942a1b73e/1231_47_2678_2078/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Tom Fold told me: \u201cOh, you do not have a good angle Carine\u201d\u2019: Ford and Roitfeld at CFDA Fashion Awards, New York, 3 June 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"776\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Tom Fold told me: \u201cOh, you do not have a good angle Carine\u201d\u2019: Ford and Roitfeld at CFDA Fashion Awards, New York, June 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Lovekin/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As for her own relationship with the mirror, \u201cI\u2019m lucky because I\u2019m rather blind now so I don\u2019t see myself very well, it\u2019s much better. Although I have to do my makeup in one of those amplified mirrors. Horrifying.\u201d She did ask Tom Ford to show her how to take a good selfie, help her find her angle, \u201cbut he say to me: \u2018Oh, you do not have a good angle Carine.\u2019 I say: \u2018Thank you Tom, that is nice of you.\u2019 He say: \u2018No no it is better that someone else takes your picture.\u2019 I say: \u2018OK, nice, stop. Do not say that.\u2019 So I do not take selfies.\u201d</p> <p>She misses Karl Lagerfeld. \u201cI really lost someone very important for me. My father died 20 years ago and Karl was\u2026 not a new father for me, but a protector.\u201d Since he died in February, she has taken on the role of <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/a27001356/carine-roitfeld-style-advisor-karl-lagerfeld-brand/\" title=\"\">style adviser at his namesake brand.</a></p> <p>I ask if he used to phone her a lot, but no, he would just text her photos of his cat, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2019/feb/20/karl-lagerfeld-cat-choupette-most-pampered-animal-in-fashion-will\" title=\"\">Choupette</a>. \u201cHe was the king of sending big bunches of flowers and handwritten letters. No one else does it like this.\u201d We meet just before French Mother\u2019s Day, and she has been thinking about this, the first one since his death. \u201cI know I will not get my flowers from him with the card saying you are a great stylist and a great mum. Mother\u2019s Day is different date in each country, how could he even know it was Mother\u2019s Day?\u201d</p> <p>She has become so tender at this bittersweet memory that I wonder, almost dreamily, what sort of mum she was.</p> <p>\u201cI was very tough with them. Screaming at them. Brush your teeth, go now to school, go and clean the car if you get a bad mark at school, make your bed, clean the kitchen even if the maid is coming. Say thank you to the taxi driver, say thank you to the waiter in the restaurant. My kids are well brought up because I was so tough with them. But I was very dedicated to them, too.\u201d Every Saturday she would take Vladimir to play football; Julia every Sunday to ride horses. She sent them to a bilingual school in Paris so they learned perfect English and now they both live in New York. She feels confident her parenting was a success, because, as adults, \u201cThey are very polite, they\u2019re working and they\u2019re not taking drugs. And my daughter would never leave her apartment without making her bed.\u201d</p> <p>So how does it feel to be the most glamorous grandma in the world, now that Julia has a daughter, Romy?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"31978a94b7c49868dad76991f3be9b5a224b4278\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31978a94b7c49868dad76991f3be9b5a224b4278/1766_69_2991_1794/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Chic is innate\u2019: Carine Roitfeld and Naomi Campbell during Paris Fashion Week, February 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Chic is innate\u2019: Carine Roitfeld and Naomi Campbell during Paris Fashion Week, February 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victor Boyko/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOh, but on Instagram I see a lot of glamorous grandmothers. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/nov/09/charlotte-olympia-fashion-designer-charlotte-dellal\" title=\"\">Andrea Dellal</a>, who lives in Rio and used to be a model. She is very glamorous and she has seven grandchildren. Very funny and laughing all the time, which is what I love, and she has good bones. And she has this, which I don\u2019t have,\u201d she says, pointing at her lack of cleavage. \u201cBut grandmothers now are not like before. My own grandmother seemed so old with her white hair. I dye mine.\u201d</p> <p>You wouldn\u2019t ever let it all out and go fully grey yourself?</p> <p>\u201cNever say never but\u2026 certainly not.\u201d</p> <p>She says it\u2019s only younger people who could think the problem with ageing is wrinkles anyway, and that once you get old, you realise that the real trouble is your back, and your eyes going. Roitfeld tells me that six years ago, she had a bad fall, leading to seven operations on her back.</p> <p>\u201cI have very fragile bones. I got the ears of my dad and the backbones of my mum.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A bit of cream, a bit of black, a bit of perfume</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I ask if she is in pain at all times, and for the first time she pauses before answering. I sense she doesn\u2019t feel able to admit it, or to complain. \u201cI have some good drugs,\u201d she says, slightly quietly. She then insists that she has to keep wearing heels because flat shoes are, according to her, not good for your back, at which point I realise that chicness is not so much innate as incurable.</p> <p>Even if she\u2019s not leaving the house, there are three things Carine Roitfeld never fails to apply every morning: \u201cA bit of cream, a bit of black, a bit of perfume.\u201d And there we have it: my new mantra.</p> <p>That night, I try her trick of leaving on my eyeliner and mascara and the next morning, oh my goodness, the transformation has actually worked. All right, so it\u2019s my transformation into a panda rather than a Parisian, but still. The 8th arrondissement wasn\u2019t built in a day.</p> <p><em>Net-a-Porter debuts Carine Roitfeld Parfums, the French editor\u2019s first fragrance collection, as exclusive retail partner</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Carine Roitfeld was the editor of French Vogue for 10 years, worked closely with Karl Lagerfeld, is an adviser to Tom Ford \u2013 and is an absolute titan in the global fashion world. Naturally, what this means to me is that the thought of meeting her is absolutely terrifying, so I sit down in the Parisian hotel where we have arranged to do the interview and tell her this. She is dressed in black, of course, her slightly hunched posture making her look more like her 64 years. She is sipping a tiny coffee, and isn\u2019t remotely surprised I\u2019m terrified. \u201cPeople think I\u2019m judging, but I\u2019m not judging,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m watching. It\u2019s different. People sometimes say, \u2018My God her eyes will scan you,\u2019 but it\u2019s not to judge you. It\u2019s to get ideas. It\u2019s observation.\u201d Well that\u2019s all right then. French Vogue, under her tenure from 2001 to 2011, was a force to be reckoned with. It looked like nothing else. She believed in bold ideas and she loved boobs, even naked on the cover. She loved cigarettes dangling from models\u2019 mouths. She loved fur. And she loved curves. She used unskinny models Crystal Renn and Lara Stone, and did a cover with the blonde, mainstream-looking model Carolyn Murphy prancing around with Andre J, a black transgender model in a dress and a beard. \u201cWould Anna Wintour ever allow such a thing?\u201d asked the American website Jezebel at the time. I have brought the current issue of French Vogue with me and we flick through it together. All the models are the exact same skinniness. \u201cI do not like this,\u201d she says. \u201cI like older women. I like bigger girls. I like black women. I did everything first. But people forget, because people forget everything. I feel totally comfortable with everyone. It is my strength, to be open-minded, always.\u201d It does seem to be true \u2013 she is even interested in my red handbag, which is made of fake leather, cost about \u00a350 from a small animal-friendly brand she\u2019s never heard of, and is bursting at the seams \u201cbecause you put too much stuff in it,\u201d she says, as if she\u2019s my mum. After too many years spent reading all those books about how to be chic like a Frenchwoman and hating them so much I\u2019d feel compelled to go straight out and buy one about how to date like them, too, and then how to raise children who eat like French enfants, I feel I should be expert in how to be an insouciant yet glamorous Parisian \u2013 except it hasn\u2019t worked at all. I am not remotely chic. My love life is so English it\u2019s practically Chaucerian. My child subsists on potatoes. So I want to ask this most Parisienne of Parisiennes for her secrets \u2013 can she make me chic? I have this scarf, you see, and every time I tie it in a knot it doesn\u2019t look right. I ask her to tie it better on me, but she takes it off me and ties it better on herself \u2013 by not tying it at all. \u201cNever a knot,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I learned this from Tom Ford, not France.\u201d She shows me that you either wrap it around your neck once with two long ends dangling down either side of your chest, or you fold it so it\u2019s doubled over and half the length and then thread it through itself a little bit like a tie. Not a knot, you understand. I ask Roitfeld, when I look at a Parisian woman who doesn\u2019t have much makeup on and is in a simple navy sweater and jeans and yet looks stunning, what is she spending her money on. What has she paid for that I can\u2019t see? Is it a dermatologist? Roitfeld nods \u2013 I have hit the nail on the head. \u201cTo be beautiful costs so much money,\u201d she agrees. \u201cFor something you don\u2019t see.\u201d She favours the aesthetician Herv\u00e9 Herau for her own skin treatments, which she suggests are just a bit of cream, really. She is not keen on younger women getting Botox at all, while she thinks older women often overdo it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to name names but there are some who can\u2019t move their faces any more.

In the years after leaving Vogue in 2011, her son Vladimir worked on convincing her that her name was valuable and that rather than keep only working for other brands she could become one herself. She was surprised, but she trusted him, and gradually they went into business together, launching her bi-annual magazine CR Fashion Book, her creative talent agency CR Studio, and now her Carine Roitfeld Parfums, for which she has created her 7 Lovers range, sold exclusively at Net-a-Porter, each perfume is named after a different fantasy lover from her imagination. So there is the English lover, called George, like our royal prince, \u201cYes, like him, your future queen,\u201d she says, suggesting either a language barrier or that she knows something I don\u2019t about Prince William\u2019s son.

Her daughter, Julia Restoin Roitfeld, has also been involved, having taken a nude photo of her mother a couple of years ago that they decided to use for her marketing, after checking with Vladimir. \u201cIf he say I can do it, I can do it.\u201d She says the French aren\u2019t hung up on nudity like we are, although when her own Russian father would parade naked around their French apartment during her childhood, the neighbours did sometimes call the police, \u201cbecause they didn\u2019t like to see it in front of their windows. But he didn\u2019t care.\u201d Vladimir also encouraged her to put a Muslim model in a hijab on the cover of her own magazine. The model was Halima Aden, a Somali who was born in a refugee camp in Kenya before moving to America as a child, becoming her American school\u2019s homecoming queen and entering Miss Minnesota. Roitfeld saw those photographs, used her on the cover and Aden now has a high-profile modelling career, having now appeared on the cover of British Vogue, too. \u201cWhen I\u2019m thinking about something he say yes you can do this no you can not do this. He gives a balance to me, which I need, because I\u2019m a bit fearless, I can go too far. When I put this girl with the Muslim scarf I was not sure because no one did it before. But he say, \u2018I think it\u2019s you, do it. Even if some people kill you, it\u2019s you, do it. You open minds.\u2019\u201d At this point I realise this went beyond a cultural or fashion decision \u2013 she genuinely thought she might get murdered. \u201cAnd they do kill me, but it\u2019s OK.\u201d Wait, Carine, nobody killed you, you\u2019re still here. You mean you were\u2026 criticised? \u201cYes, but a lot. It\u2019s different in different countries. When you\u2019re doing something new, it\u2019s normal to have critics. Every time I did a new thing I get criticised, but funnily I do a new thing because it\u2019s my way of thinking, my way of loving people. I\u2019m very open-minded. This girl was so beautiful, and she wore her scarf, and there are a lot of girls in scarves in fashion now \u2013 you\u2019re not going to put them away from fashion, they\u2019re too big now.\u201d I mention how multicultural British Vogue has become under its new editor Edward Enninful. It\u2019s been a huge shift. \u201cYes, good! But he took my girl! He take my model! Halima become a huge voice now and great for her. I find other ones. It\u2019s part of the world today.\u201d On the one hand, CR is from a world of French chic that is, to me, impenetrable. On the other, she is really very funny and tells me that she likes makeup best when you only take half of it off at night \u201cso you\u2019ve got black smudged around your eyes the next day, and this is why people think French women are dirty,\u201d and that she doesn\u2019t follow the supermodel maxim about obsessively moisturising on aeroplanes, \u201cbecause I\u2019m always too cold, I just put my big sunglasses on when I land.\u201d Her high-powered morning health routine is composed of the two major nutrients, \u201cespresso and cigarettes\u201d, and she doesn\u2019t like seeing women doing their makeup in their cars, on their way to work. Because it\u2019s vulgar? \u201cBecause it\u2019s dangerous!\u201d As for her own relationship with the mirror, \u201cI\u2019m lucky because I\u2019m rather blind now so I don\u2019t see myself very well, it\u2019s much better. Although I have to do my makeup in one of those amplified mirrors. Horrifying.\u201d She did ask Tom Ford to show her how to take a good selfie, help her find her angle, \u201cbut he say to me: \u2018Oh, you do not have a good angle Carine.\u2019 I say: \u2018Thank you Tom, that is nice of you.\u2019 He say: \u2018No no it is better that someone else takes your picture.\u2019 I say: \u2018OK, nice, stop. Do not say that.\u2019 So I do not take selfies.\u201d She misses Karl Lagerfeld. \u201cI really lost someone very important for me. My father died 20 years ago and Karl was\u2026 not a new father for me, but a protector.\u201d Since he died in February, she has taken on the role of style adviser at his namesake brand. I ask if he used to phone her a lot, but no, he would just text her photos of his cat, Choupette. \u201cHe was the king of sending big bunches of flowers and handwritten letters. No one else does it like this.\u201d We meet just before French Mother\u2019s Day, and she has been thinking about this, the first one since his death. \u201cI know I will not get my flowers from him with the card saying you are a great stylist and a great mum. Mother\u2019s Day is different date in each country, how could he even know it was Mother\u2019s Day?\u201d She has become so tender at this bittersweet memory that I wonder, almost dreamily, what sort of mum she was. \u201cI was very tough with them. Screaming at them. Brush your teeth, go now to school, go and clean the car if you get a bad mark at school, make your bed, clean the kitchen even if the maid is coming. Say thank you to the taxi driver, say thank you to the waiter in the restaurant. My kids are well brought up because I was so tough with them. But I was very dedicated to them, too.\u201d Every Saturday she would take Vladimir to play football; Julia every Sunday to ride horses. She sent them to a bilingual school in Paris so they learned perfect English and now they both live in New York. She feels confident her parenting was a success, because, as adults, \u201cThey are very polite, they\u2019re working and they\u2019re not taking drugs. And my daughter would never leave her apartment without making her bed.\u201d So how does it feel to be the most glamorous grandma in the world, now that Julia has a daughter, Romy? \u201cOh, but on Instagram I see a lot of glamorous grandmothers. Andrea Dellal, who lives in Rio and used to be a model. She is very glamorous and she has seven grandchildren. Very funny and laughing all the time, which is what I love, and she has good bones. And she has this, which I don\u2019t have,\u201d she says, pointing at her lack of cleavage. \u201cBut grandmothers now are not like before. My own grandmother seemed so old with her white hair. I dye mine.\u201d You wouldn\u2019t ever let it all out and go fully grey yourself? \u201cNever say never but\u2026 certainly not.\u201d She says it\u2019s only younger people who could think the problem with ageing is wrinkles anyway, and that once you get old, you realise that the real trouble is your back, and your eyes going. Roitfeld tells me that six years ago, she had a bad fall, leading to seven operations on her back. \u201cI have very fragile bones. I got the ears of my dad and the backbones of my mum.\u201d I ask if she is in pain at all times, and for the first time she pauses before answering. I sense she doesn\u2019t feel able to admit it, or to complain. \u201cI have some good drugs,\u201d she says, slightly quietly. She then insists that she has to keep wearing heels because flat shoes are, according to her, not good for your back, at which point I realise that chicness is not so much innate as incurable. Even if she\u2019s not leaving the house, there are three things Carine Roitfeld never fails to apply every morning: \u201cA bit of cream, a bit of black, a bit of perfume.\u201d And there we have it: my new mantra. That night, I try her trick of leaving on my eyeliner and mascara and the next morning, oh my goodness, the transformation has actually worked. All right, so it\u2019s my transformation into a panda rather than a Parisian, but still. The 8th arrondissement wasn\u2019t built in a day.

      "body": "<p>Days after Hong Kong\u2019s first major protest against its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/03/hong-kong-push-allow-extradition-china-protests\" title=\"\">stalled extradition law</a>, a property firm decided to take a \u00a32.5m hit and abandon an option to develop a slice of prime city land, blaming \u201csocial contradiction and economic instability\u201d.</p> <p>The decision by Goldin Financial Holdings was made after one of its directors, a pro-Beijing lawmaker called Abraham Shek Lai-him, called an urgent meeting to discuss whether to go ahead with the project on part of the old city airport.</p> <p>Shek had played a key role dragging the extradition law through parliament. He insisted after the vote that Goldin had a positive view of the extradition bill.</p> <p>He is part of a community that faces serious risks from the law \u2013 which would allow residents and visitors to be sent for trial in the mainland\u2019s opaque, Communist party-controlled courts \u2013 and yet either worked hard to back it, or refrained from criticising it until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/21/hong-kong-protesters-gather-extradition-bill-legco-carrie-lam\" title=\"\">mass protests</a> caused an abrupt government climbdown.</p> <p>Hong Kong has built its reputation as an international financial and trading centre on China\u2019s doorstep shielded from its autocratic government by the legal system set up by British colonial rulers.</p> <p>Its courts are considered independent, giving companies security to invest there, adding to its role as a regional hub. The possibility of extradition to China could transform that; its main rival as a base for foreign firms, Singapore, has apparently been watching events with delight as the Hong Kong government prepared to dismantle one of the pillars of its success.</p> <p>Ordinary citizens are well aware of the risks. As the popular uprising against the law thrust Hong Kong into the spotlight, much of the attention focused on how it could erode the city\u2019s civil liberties and put dissidents at risk. But those who turned out on the streets were not only worried about freedom of speech and religion. Many said they feared for their jobs or their children\u2019s prospects.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74099331a36d6a92911730958573dd9cb9745022\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74099331a36d6a92911730958573dd9cb9745022/0_311_4640_2783/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters converging on Hong Kong\u2019s police headquarters last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters converging on Hong Kong\u2019s police headquarters last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: H\u00e9ctor Retamal/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The city\u2019s business elite was not originally so bold. Many chose to stay silent even as concerns mounted at international firms and small businesses, and the city\u2019s legal society made a rare intervention calling for a delay.</p> <p>China officially says the law is an independent initiative by the leader it hand-picked for the city, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/14/carrie-lam-hong-kong-chief-executive-china-beijing-puppet\" title=\"\">Carrie Lam</a>. However Beijing\u2019s enthusiasm for the law has been clear; some of the most senior politicians in the country have spoken out in support. And in late May, they summoned more than 200 pro-Beijing officials and business leaders to discuss the bill and seek support, the <em>New York Times</em> reported.</p> <p>But after years of comprehensive crackdowns on political opponents, including pro-democracy lawmakers, pro-independence politicians and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/30/-sp-hong-kong-umbrella-revolution-pro-democracy-protests\" title=\"\">the campaigners of the umbrella movement</a>, the government clearly underestimated opposition to the new law.</p> <p>Protesters forced Lam \u2013 and by implication Beijing \u2013 into a rare reversal. And with the law suspended, a few members of the economic elite are starting to step out of line.</p> <p>Pro-Beijing legislator Felix Chung, who represents the textiles sector, warned in surprisingly blunt comments that the law could leave many of the city\u2019s tycoons vulnerable. One of the offences for which extradition would be possible is corruption.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we started to open up factories in China, the overall rule of law was not so mature. A lot of things had to be done by special ways, through corruption, bribery or whatever,\u201d said Chung, who opened his factory on the mainland in 1993.</p> <p>Because the Communist party and the legal system are intertwined in China, it would potentially only take one falling out with a powerful official or Chinese business rival to put employees at risk.</p> <p>Cases like those of Canadians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/16/canadians-detained-in-china-charged-with-espionage\" title=\"\">Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor </a>loom large for businesses with offices in Hong Kong, who worry the law could make them vulnerable.</p> <p>The two men were arrested in China on espionage charges. But Canadian authorities have denounced the charges as flimsy pretexts used to seize the men <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/02/trump-banning-huawei-beginning-of-biggest-trade-war-ever-united-states\" title=\"\">as part of a wider political dispute</a> tied to the fate of a senior executive from telecoms firm Huawei.</p> <p>China has shown its willingness to go after enemies in Hong Kong without regard for the law; kidnapping dissident booksellers and a mainland Chinese billionaire tycoon and spiriting them across the border.</p> <p>The ability for Beijing to mount similar raids legally is a big worry for any business, and for anyone living in Hong Kong. Among the signs at recent protests was one that read \u201cFirst: Canadians Kovrig and Spavor. Next: you and me?\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Days after Hong Kong\u2019s first major protest against its stalled extradition law, a property firm decided to take a \u00a32.5m hit and abandon an option to develop a slice of prime city land, blaming \u201csocial contradiction and economic instability\u201d. The decision by Goldin Financial Holdings was made after one of its directors, a pro-Beijing lawmaker called Abraham Shek Lai-him, called an urgent meeting to discuss whether to go ahead with the project on part of the old city airport. Shek had played a key role dragging the extradition law through parliament. He insisted after the vote that Goldin had a positive view of the extradition bill. He is part of a community that faces serious risks from the law \u2013 which would allow residents and visitors to be sent for trial in the mainland\u2019s opaque, Communist party-controlled courts \u2013 and yet either worked hard to back it, or refrained from criticising it until mass protests caused an abrupt government climbdown. Hong Kong has built its reputation as an international financial and trading centre on China\u2019s doorstep shielded from its autocratic government by the legal system set up by British colonial rulers. Its courts are considered independent, giving companies security to invest there, adding to its role as a regional hub. The possibility of extradition to China could transform that; its main rival as a base for foreign firms, Singapore, has apparently been watching events with delight as the Hong Kong government prepared to dismantle one of the pillars of its success. Ordinary citizens are well aware of the risks. As the popular uprising against the law thrust Hong Kong into the spotlight, much of the attention focused on how it could erode the city\u2019s civil liberties and put dissidents at risk. But those who turned out on the streets were not only worried about freedom of speech and religion. Many said they feared for their jobs or their children\u2019s prospects. The city\u2019s business elite was not originally so bold. Many chose to stay silent even as concerns mounted at international firms and small businesses, and the city\u2019s legal society made a rare intervention calling for a delay. China officially says the law is an independent initiative by the leader it hand-picked for the city, Carrie Lam. However Beijing\u2019s enthusiasm for the law has been clear; some of the most senior politicians in the country have spoken out in support. And in late May, they summoned more than 200 pro-Beijing officials and business leaders to discuss the bill and seek support, the New York Times reported. But after years of comprehensive crackdowns on political opponents, including pro-democracy lawmakers, pro-independence politicians and the campaigners of the umbrella movement, the government clearly underestimated opposition to the new law. Protesters forced Lam \u2013 and by implication Beijing \u2013 into a rare reversal. And with the law suspended, a few members of the economic elite are starting to step out of line. Pro-Beijing legislator Felix Chung, who represents the textiles sector, warned in surprisingly blunt comments that the law could leave many of the city\u2019s tycoons vulnerable. One of the offences for which extradition would be possible is corruption. \u201cWhen we started to open up factories in China, the overall rule of law was not so mature. A lot of things had to be done by special ways, through corruption, bribery or whatever,\u201d said Chung, who opened his factory on the mainland in 1993. Because the Communist party and the legal system are intertwined in China, it would potentially only take one falling out with a powerful official or Chinese business rival to put employees at risk. Cases like those of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor loom large for businesses with offices in Hong Kong, who worry the law could make them vulnerable. The two men were arrested in China on espionage charges. But Canadian authorities have denounced the charges as flimsy pretexts used to seize the men as part of a wider political dispute tied to the fate of a senior executive from telecoms firm Huawei. China has shown its willingness to go after enemies in Hong Kong without regard for the law; kidnapping dissident booksellers and a mainland Chinese billionaire tycoon and spiriting them across the border. The ability for Beijing to mount similar raids legally is a big worry for any business, and for anyone living in Hong Kong. Among the signs at recent protests was one that read \u201cFirst: Canadians Kovrig and Spavor. Next: you and me?\u201d",

His rival has the support of more than twice as many MPs.

It is a deeply unsatisfactory process, from which the vast majority of the country are disenfranchised, but it is the only process there is.

He will never tell better jokes. He will never make more fantastical promises. He will never match the other man\u2019s gift with the flamboyant phrase and the outrageous untruth.

Mr Hunt can\u2019t contest at that level so he should campaign as the candidate who invites Tories to think soberly about themselves, their country and the qualities that ought to be required of a prime minister.</p> <p>He is entitled to make character an issue. Not as in personality, but as in moral character. The Tories have a history as a party of falling for scoundrels who present as \u201clovable rogues\u201d. This has always been an integral element of Boris Johnson\u2019s popularity with the Tory grassroots. But do they really want to hand Number 10 to someone quite this roguish? And is he actually all that lovable? The spotlight has been swivelled on to his torrid personal life by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/21/police-called-to-loud-altercation-at-boris-johnsons-home\" title=\"\">episode</a> in the early hours of Friday morning at his girlfriend\u2019s home. Neighbours who called the police heard banging, slamming, shouting, screaming, swearing, stuff getting smashed and Carrie Symonds complaining that a sofa had been ruined with red wine: \u201cYou just don\u2019t care for anything because you\u2019re spoilt. You have no care for money or anything.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s an unattractive character reference from someone who goes to bed with him.

He is also a far more ruthless, and frankly nastier, figure than the public appreciates.\u201d</p> <p>Politicians can change their hairstyles, waistlines, tax policies, views on transport projects and sexual partners, but they can\u2019t change their essential character.</p> <p>Mr Hunt will be wary of getting very personal, but he doesn\u2019t have to get into his rival\u2019s rackety private life to make the case that a Johnson premiership would be a hair-raising gamble with both the future of the Tory party and the future of Britain. Of course, Tory members probably know this already and perhaps they do not care. An eye-popping poll suggests that a majority of them will sacrifice almost anything in order to get Brexit, including the United Kingdom itself. They\u2019d see Scotland and Northern Ireland ripped out of the UK rather than give up on Brexit. A large majority would quit the EU even if it inflicted \u201csignificant damage\u201d on the economy and \u201c<a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/06/18/most-conservative-members-would-see-party-destroye\" title=\"\">destroyed</a>\u201d their party. This is the view of people who call themselves members of the Conservative and Unionist party.</p> <p>So one of Mr Hunt\u2019s tasks is to sit the Tory party down, tell it to breathe deeply and invite it to have a proper think. Are they really prepared to contemplate the ruination of so many things they once cherished in pursuit of an ultra\u2019s version of Brexit? Is a party that once prided itself on being sensible really prepared to take a wild gamble on a Johnson premiership?</p> <p>One duty that falls on Mr Hunt is to use the next month to direct fierce scrutiny at his rival\u2019s often shifting and contradictory propositions about Brexit. Boris Johnson promises that he can negotiate a better deal and, if he can\u2019t, Britain will be out \u201ccome what may\u201d on 31 October. How exactly is he going to do a deal by Halloween with an EU that says it won\u2019t reopen the withdrawal agreement? If he is in possession of a magical solution to the Irish border conundrum, why didn\u2019t he reveal this masterplan to his colleagues during the two years when he sat in the cabinet as foreign secretary? How is he going to take Britain out of the EU without a deal when there is no mandate from the people for a crash-out Brexit and no majority for that outcome in parliament? He now echoes Nigel Farage in suggesting that Britain has a pain-free option called \u201cleaving on WTO (World Trade Organisation) terms\u201d. If that is a credible plan of action, why was it not aired by him or his fellow Brexiters during the 2016 referendum? Could it be because it is just another fantasy that doesn\u2019t withstand a moment of examination by anyone who understands how <a href=\"https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2019/06/ivan-rogers-no-deal-is-now-the-most-likely-outcome/\" title=\"\">trade agreements work</a>?</p> <p>These are questions that need asking and pressing, asking again and pressing again, until Mr Johnson runs out of unicorns to ride and places to hide.

      "body": "<p>Fashion takes its inspiration from diverse places \u2013 yet this summer some of the biggest trends are being influenced by a particularly unlikely source: fishing \u2013 or rather angling, to be specific.</p> <p>It\u2019s not the first time that fisherman fashion has been co-opted by those who don\u2019t necessarily spend their leisure time with rods, reels and sinkers. But forget the Aran jumpers, thick-knit scarfs and rolled-up beanies that hit the catwalk \u2013 and subsequently the high street \u2013 circa 2016. This time around it is the utilitarian, functional fashion favoured by those fishing rivers and lakes that have become an unlikely style muse.</p> <p>On the catwalk this spring and summer, pocket-heavy fishing gilets came in botanical prints at Anna Sui, as well as more traditional khaki at Sacai \u2013 signalling that, unlike deep-sea fishing trends past, the angler look is not weighted towards menswear. Men do have their chance to pick up on the trend though \u2013 pocketed gilets also featured heavily at the Louis Vuitton menswear show.</p> <p>On the high street, fisherman gilets have since cropped up at brands including Topshop and Urban Outfitters.</p> <p>It is unlikely that comedians Bob Mortimer and Paul Whitehouse thought of themselves as trendsetters when they set out to make the BBC series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/20/mortimer-whitehouse-gone-fishing-a-comic-reflection-on-life-mortality-and-tench\" title=\"\"><em>Gone Fishing</em></a>.

Asos saw sales rise by 343% in a year while Weekday currently offers 10 different styles of fisherman\u2019s hat, all in heavy-duty, technical materials.</p> <p>Footwear, too, has taken a decidedly fishy turn, especially at the autumn/winter shows, suggesting this isn\u2019t merely a fair-weather trend. Thigh-high welly-style waders featured on the catwalk at Jacquemus and Toga, while the latter also showcased shoes resembling galoshes, paired with hooded anoraks.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the Christmas Island bootie sold by fly-fishing and game-shooting brand Orvis bares a keen resemblance to Balenciaga\u2019s stretch-knit high-top trainers.</p> <p>Gemma Hayward, senior fashion editor at large for <em>Grazia</em> magazine (and member of her local angling society) cites practicality as part of the trend\u2019s appeal.</p> <p>\u201cFashion\u2019s current obsession with utility dressing is crossing catwalks and the gender divide,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s only natural that something as useful as the multi-pocket waistcoat has been given a high-fashion spin \u2013 just replace hooks and bait for purses and phones.\u201d</p> <p>Despite this rise to high fashion, recreational fishing does not enjoy the wellness associations of the sporting attire worn to boutique gym classes and yoga retreats. But could it?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eae376a2a226657b8eb40f8f19a5f834cd56f776\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eae376a2a226657b8eb40f8f19a5f834cd56f776/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fishin\u2019 fashion: Sacai, MSGM and Toga.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fishin\u2019 fashion: Sacai, MSGM and Toga.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Rex/Shutterstock/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSitting by a beautiful lake, focusing on your float is a surprisingly peaceful way to while away a few hours,\u201d says Hayward, making the case for fishing as a sport that may, in fact, tap into on-trend ideas about mindfulness and meditation \u2013 not to mention its Instagram-ability.</p> <p>\u201cPeople who fish always say it focuses the mind and has a tranquility to it,\u201d says fashion historian Tony Glenville. \u201cWhat could be a better escape from Brexit? It also makes me think of all those Britpop boys who moved to the country.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s true that the concept of having \u201cgone fishing\u201d is not a million miles from the more modern desire to go \u201coff-grid\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s great to see that our little passion can inspire some items on the catwalk,\u201d says Jo Stephenson, an Angling Trust ambassador. Waders or a sunshirt are often angling essentials, she says, although her own must-have item is a bumbag, the 90s accessory which has experienced a fashion revival over recent summers. Not, then, the fully functioning fishing set \u2013 comprising rod, flies and a wicker \u201ccreel\u201d bag, and costing \u00a317,000 \u2013 currently offered by French fashion house Herm\u00e8s.</p> <p>While fishing brands are striving to make the clothes worn by keen fishers more attractive, part of the appeal to those outside this community will doubtless lie in the fact that such garments reject conventional ideas of fashion and style.</p> <p>It\u2019s about a desire for clothes \u201cwith integrity, real clothes and not \u2018fashion\u2019 \u2013 even though it is\u201d, says Glenville. </p>",

On the catwalk this spring and summer, pocket-heavy fishing gilets came in botanical prints at Anna Sui, as well as more traditional khaki at Sacai \u2013 signalling that, unlike deep-sea fishing trends past, the angler look is not weighted towards menswear. Men do have their chance to pick up on the trend though \u2013 pocketed gilets also featured heavily at the Louis Vuitton menswear show. On the high street, fisherman gilets have since cropped up at brands including Topshop and Urban Outfitters. It is unlikely that comedians Bob Mortimer and Paul Whitehouse thought of themselves as trendsetters when they set out to make the BBC series Gone Fishing. But they were ahead of the game. Fisherman\u2019s hats are very much on trend, having been spearheaded by the likes of Rihanna, Kaia Gerber and Bella Hadid, as well as featuring in shows from Craig Green to Burberry, and more recently MSGM. Asos saw sales rise by 343% in a year while Weekday currently offers 10 different styles of fisherman\u2019s hat, all in heavy-duty, technical materials. Footwear, too, has taken a decidedly fishy turn, especially at the autumn/winter shows, suggesting this isn\u2019t merely a fair-weather trend. Thigh-high welly-style waders featured on the catwalk at Jacquemus and Toga, while the latter also showcased shoes resembling galoshes, paired with hooded anoraks. Elsewhere, the Christmas Island bootie sold by fly-fishing and game-shooting brand Orvis bares a keen resemblance to Balenciaga\u2019s stretch-knit high-top trainers. Gemma Hayward, senior fashion editor at large for Grazia magazine (and member of her local angling society) cites practicality as part of the trend\u2019s appeal. \u201cFashion\u2019s current obsession with utility dressing is crossing catwalks and the gender divide,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s only natural that something as useful as the multi-pocket waistcoat has been given a high-fashion spin \u2013 just replace hooks and bait for purses and phones.\u201d Despite this rise to high fashion, recreational fishing does not enjoy the wellness associations of the sporting attire worn to boutique gym classes and yoga retreats. But could it? \u201cSitting by a beautiful lake, focusing on your float is a surprisingly peaceful way to while away a few hours,\u201d says Hayward, making the case for fishing as a sport that may, in fact, tap into on-trend ideas about mindfulness and meditation \u2013 not to mention its Instagram-ability. \u201cPeople who fish always say it focuses the mind and has a tranquility to it,\u201d says fashion historian Tony Glenville. \u201cWhat could be a better escape from Brexit? It also makes me think of all those Britpop boys who moved to the country.\u201d It\u2019s true that the concept of having \u201cgone fishing\u201d is not a million miles from the more modern desire to go \u201coff-grid\u201d. \u201cI think it\u2019s great to see that our little passion can inspire some items on the catwalk,\u201d says Jo Stephenson, an Angling Trust ambassador. Waders or a sunshirt are often angling essentials, she says, although her own must-have item is a bumbag, the 90s accessory which has experienced a fashion revival over recent summers. Not, then, the fully functioning fishing set \u2013 comprising rod, flies and a wicker \u201ccreel\u201d bag, and costing \u00a317,000 \u2013 currently offered by French fashion house Herm\u00e8s. While fishing brands are striving to make the clothes worn by keen fishers more attractive, part of the appeal to those outside this community will doubtless lie in the fact that such garments reject conventional ideas of fashion and style. It\u2019s about a desire for clothes \u201cwith integrity, real clothes and not \u2018fashion\u2019 \u2013 even though it is\u201d, says Glenville.",

Or they use auto-rickshaws or informally run local van services that are not safe.\u201d</p> <p>Shah is the first to concede that free public transport is not a silver bullet. All the other factors \u2013 policing, street lighting, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/25/india-battling-sexual-violence-gender-delhi-rickshaw-drivers\" title=\"\">changes in male mentality </a>\u2013 are vital. Although it\u2019s true that the presence of more women on public transport will make women feel more secure, it\u2019s also true, he concedes, that once women get out of a metro station, they are in the same unsafe streets and public spaces.

This Hulu big-budget vehicle, mainly driven by George Clooney, who co-produces, co-stars and also directs a couple of the (six) episodes, succeeds with something approaching magnificence, and I\u2019m starting to wonder if there\u2019s any \u201cunadaptable\u201d classic that telly <em>can\u2019t</em> manage in this, its new golden age.</p> <p>The writers have done a fine job not just of pacing but of condensing Heller\u2019s tricksy timeline into an all-too-credible arc, and also of shepherding the action perfectly between barrack-room lunacies and, actually, seriously exciting CGI\u2019d aerial sequences. I\u2019m not sure whether it was a great idea for Clooney to appear himself, least of all as such an odious character as Lieutenant (later General) Scheisskopf, boorish stickler and cuckold, and the nearest that either book or series comes to cliche. But there are few men who won\u2019t appear even better in the just-so khaki pants and subtle collar stars and tucked ties of the USAAF of the 40s and 50s and so, good-looking boy though George certainly is, maybe he just couldn\u2019t resist the uniform.</p> <p>But it\u2019s Christopher Abbott who really excels. John \u201cYo-Yo\u201d Yossarian is an everyman, yes, but with a difference \u2013 he\u2019s got attitude to spare, and cojones, and a certain surliness \u2013 and Abbott plays him with a streak of fun.</p> <p>There\u2019s one relatively early exchange when, after basic training and shipping to the Italian island of Pianosa, there to load his B-52 for further pointless bombing raids (the Germans having already fled Rome), Yossarian confides to a colleague:</p> <p>\u2013 \u201cI\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p> <p>\u2013 \u201cThat\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of.\u201d</p> <p>\u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed. I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p> <p>And that, in hindsight, says it all. This is <em>all</em> about someone who\u2019s quite at ease in his own skin yet, strangely enough, just doesn\u2019t want to suddenly die. As the sorties are ramped up, against all logic and sometimes for petty revenge, there becomes an increasingly noxious contrast between life and death. It can be no coincidence that the \u201clife\u201d part is such a good life: the bomber boys stripping off and jumping off Italian cliffs in impossible sunshine, or sauntering through Rome with young lives before them; and then the sudden jump-cut to Yo-Yo in the bomb bay of his aircraft, black blooms of flak all around, his thoughts vaguely on just glimpsed targets and sweating hands, on the pettifogging bureaucracy and bluster back at base, the random illogic and arbitrary bombing lines. And we, too, feel the fear and sigh a heartfelt nervous shudder when we see him back on the beach, knowing it\u2019s got to come again.</p> <p>Half anti-war paean, half mighty roar against gung-ho lying idiocy, it\u2019s as powerful as it was all those years ago.

Co-organiser Emily Eavis estimates \u201cthe ban will save the million bottles that we would have otherwise sold\u201d and is in line with the festival\u2019s ethos to tread lightly on the land. Instead, the 200,000-strong audience will be served by 850 water taps and dozens of water kiosks, using Worthy Farm\u2019s purpose-built water reservoirs.</p> <p>Earlier this year <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-48380605\" title=\"\">more than 60 major festivals, including Reading, Leeds and Download, pledged to go plastic-free by 2021</a>.

      "bodyText": "When Chris Johnson first started putting on outdoor parties with his mates, they were small, impromptu and shambolic \u2013 or \u201creally good fun\u201d, as he puts it. Seventeen years later and he and the same four university friends are still pioneering in their field of partying, albeit Shambala is now a four-day festival in rural Northamptonshire with 15,000 people that has set an industry standard for its eco-credentials. \u201cWe\u2019re a purpose-led organisation, the point of it existing is to contribute something to the world,\u201d says Johnson, \u201cand the environment is an important part of our outlook; we have a responsibility \u2013 but also an opportunity to experiment.\u201d The festival now uses 100% renewable power from a mix of vegetable oil and solar power units, has eradicated disposable plastics, and became fully meat and fish free in 2015. \u201cIt caused a storm initially,\u201d says Johnson, \u201cbut the appetite is there. This year we\u2019ve got 1% of our audience coming by bike and 25% by coach. It might not seem much, but 80% of the carbon footprint of a camping festival is made by travel down to the site.\u201d If the cultural conversation around festivals in recent years has focused on shaming organisers into booking more female musicians for their lineups or making them less white, the buzz this summer is on sustainability: how can festivals go green? For one, the war on plastic seems to have proliferated: this year, Glastonbury has banned the sale of single-use plastic drink bottles across the site. Co-organiser Emily Eavis estimates \u201cthe ban will save the million bottles that we would have otherwise sold\u201d and is in line with the festival\u2019s ethos to tread lightly on the land. Instead, the 200,000-strong audience will be served by 850 water taps and dozens of water kiosks, using Worthy Farm\u2019s purpose-built water reservoirs. Earlier this year more than 60 major festivals, including Reading, Leeds and Download, pledged to go plastic-free by 2021. Straws, cutlery and bottles remain major offenders and bans have been met with enthusiasm by audiences. But according to Claire O\u2019Neill, co-founder of the not-for-profit organisation A Greener Festival, which audits and advises the industry on how to reduce its environmental impact, the key challenges remain \u201ctransport, tents and toilets\u201d. Getting festival-goers to the site using public transport or signing up to car-share schemes makes the biggest difference to the carbon footprint. Trying to make sure they pack up and take their tents is also a major environmental headache. \u201cWe actively ask people to consider what they bring to the festival and urge them not to bring disposable tents,\u201d says Ian Fielder, operations director at Green Man festival. \u201cWe don\u2019t ban it because we don\u2019t want to become financially prohibitive, but they are a bane for most festivals. The waste is extraordinary.\u201d Green Man works with refugee charities to repurpose left-behind tents, but emphasises that many of them are impossible to recycle and get sent to incinerators. At Houghton, an electronic music festival set in a Norfolk estate, sewage is treated equally seriously. \u201cWe\u2019re using compostable toilets across the site this year,\u201d says co-founder Tom Elkington, who explains at length the environmental benefits over chemical portable toilets. \u201cBeing sustainable and ethical is a core social responsibility for us \u2013 a lot of what we do isn\u2019t legislation, but it probably should be.\u201d For Festival Republic boss Melvin Benn, who runs major events including Latitude and Wireless, efficient use of the diesel-powered generators used on sites remains a key focal point.

Plus train reservations The sight of a gleaming railway snaking over an Alpine pass or hugging a lake has long inspired travellers, and both are well served by rail routes. This itinerary weaves from France through Switzerland to Austria, with spectacular views that will glue you to the train windows. At Lausanne, be sure to take an early morning dip at Plage de Pully, watching the sun rise over the Alps as you swim. Heading onwards, skirt Lake Geneva to the beautiful town of Annecy, and take the chance to paddle a canoe to La Cuill\u00e8re \u00e0 Omble, a restaurant at the lake\u2019s southern end, serving local freshwater fish. Eastwards, at Chamonix, take the cable car to the top of the Aiguille du Midi for lunch at the self-service cafeteria of Le 3842 Restaurant, named for its lofty altitude. The journey onwards to Zermatt takes in magnificent scenery as the train hugs the mountainside. The stylish Swiss resort has wonderful hiking terrain, overlooked by the Matterhorn. At Lucerne, explore the cobbled alleys of the Kornmarkt and dine at the intimate, candlelit Grottino 1313 restaurant. From there, plunge onwards through the Arlberg valley to St Anton, home to some exhilarating ebike routes, after which you can take a deserved dip at the Arlberg Well spa. Continue east to lakeside Zell am See, where activities include paddleboarding, wakeboarding and waterskiing. Three times a week the free Magic Lake Show lights up the water. The route home stops at Innsbruck, with its space-age funicular and gondola to the top of the Nordkette, at 2,256 metres, with a jaw-dropping view. Explore the historic old town and the Imperial Palace, with its opulence of the Habsburg dynasty. Next, travel to Bern, whose old town was declared a Unesco world heritage site in 1983. The city is also home to the Einstein Museum. Thun makes for a scenic 20-minute side trip. Fast TGV and Eurostar trains will then speed you home. Itinerary Journey times for all five itineraries can vary depending on date and time of departure. These recommendations are for faster connections, though not necessarily the fastest possible, and generally leaving in the morning on weekdays. We have prioritised trains that: require no reservation; are known to be very comfortable (such as RailJet); or have good on-board services (such as the ICE).

Rail pilgrimages to the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur began many years ago, when affluent Brits would venture south on the Train Bleu. This itinerary widens the route, spanning Barcelona and on through scenic French and Italian Riviera coastline to Rome, and then home via Switzerland. On your first evening, in Toulouse, admire the grand architecture of the Place du Capitole before drinking in the nightlife in the Carmes neighbourhood, starting at Chez Vincente bodega. From here there\u2019s a choice of routes to Barcelona: a fast train via Perpignan or Narbonne, or the longer but much more scenic regional train via Latour-de-Carol with a change at the Spanish border (no reservations needed or available, three connecting trains each day). Between Latour-de-Carol and Toulouse, sit on the left to get the best views. Once in the Catalan capital, check out the Museu d\u2019Hist\u00f2ria de Barcelona. S\u00e8te is a bustling port town crisscrossed by canals, close to eight miles of unsung beaches. Give your legs a workout in Nice on the climb up Colline du Ch\u00e2teau, past waterfalls to a panorama over the city. The sumptuous eastward journey takes you to Genoa, where the Unesco-listed, cobbled Via Garibaldi is home to the stunning Palazzo Bianco and Palazzo Rosso. From there, a Frecciarossa train will speed you south along the Ligurian coast to Rome, where the atmospheric Palatine Hill combines towering pine trees, majestic ruins and impressive views. Unrivalled granita di caff\u00e8 can be found nearby at the Tazza d\u2019Oro cafe. Travel north via Milan to the enchanting town of Stresa, above Lake Maggiore. The train route onward to Zurich runs through incredible landscapes, and the Swiss city is dotted with more than 30 river and lakeside badis \u2013 outdoor pools \u2013 for swimming by day and lounging at night. In Cologne, celebrate your endeavours with a visit to the Chocolate Museum, and its three-metre-high chocolate fountain, before catching a homebound ICE train.

Before the fjords of Norway come the canals of Amsterdam, now linked easily by Eurostar from London. Hire a bike to explore highlights such as the masterpiece-filled Rijksmuseum and then lounge in the leafy Vondelpark, home to innovative cafes such as the saucer-shaped Blue Tea House (Blauwe Theehuis). Next stop, at the historic port of L\u00fcbeck, climb the 50-metre spire of Petrikirche to gaze over the Baltic, before lunch at Cafe Niederegger: it does good sandwiches but its speciality is marzipan, which it even puts in the cappuccinos. On the journey north, the train runs on to a ferry for the 50-minute crossing to R\u00f8dbyhavn in Denmark. Then it\u2019s on to design and foodie heaven in Copenhagen, home to Designmuseum Danmark, with cutting-edge art, furniture, ceramic and digital design inspiration. In the evening, visit magical, fairy-lit Tivoli Gardens. Next day, in Gothenburg, the Museum of Art has a huge collection of Nordic paintings and sculpture and, south of the centre, Slottsskogen park has meadows and forests, and a cafe. In Oslo, visit the Vigeland Sculpture Park, with its 212 bronze and granite sculptures documenting the human condition. En route to Bergen, on the west coast, the train climbs to over 1,200 metres: you cross a mountain plateau called Hardangervidda and see waterfalls, cliffs and chasms. A sleeper takes you to Lillehammer, a pleasant lakeside town, and then it\u2019s on to compact, wonderful Trondheim, founded in 977 AD. Take a boat trip to the island of Munkholmen \u2013 formerly a fort, monastery and second world war anti-aircraft gun station. Back into Sweden, pause for lakeside relaxation in \u00d6stersund and visit Jamtli, its historic open-air museum. A must-visit in Stockholm is the Vasa Museum, home of a ship salvaged in 1628 and majestically preserved. For hipster vibes, scoot over to S\u00f6dermalm, an island within the city, and seek Bar Agrikultur in Nytorget. Speed back to Copenhagen and then on to Hamburg. Get up early for Altona fish market, which sells everything from sea creatures to fifth-hand junk \u2013 it\u2019s a wholesome recovery after a big night out in the Reeperbahn district, perhaps. Break your journey home in charming Antwerp, whose central railway station is often voted the most beautiful in the world.

Once in Ni\u0161, in southern Serbia, be sure to spend time at Holy Trinity cathedral, a curious mix of Byzantine, Islamic, Renaissance and baroque styles, replete with intricate frescoes. Onwards overnight into Bulgaria, via Sofia, you\u2019ll alight at Plovdiv, the oldest continually inhabited city in Europe. Eight thousand years after being founded, the city is 2019 European capital of culture. Don\u2019t miss one of the best-preserved amphitheatres in the world. Seven hours by sleeper later, you\u2019ll arrive in Istanbul. The historic centre, Sultanahmet, is a fabulous stew of wonders, such as the glorious Blue Mosque, with its 260 stained-glass windows. On the return journey westwards, Veliko T\u00e2rnovo in northern Bulgaria makes a good stop, not least for its wonderful handicraft market, Samovodska Charshiya. The train then heads north to Bucharest, home of the vast Palace of Parliament, the world\u2019s largest legislative building. From there, it\u2019s a long sleeper train journey to stunning Vienna, epicentre of cafe culture. Explore museums such as Haus der Musik with rooms dedicated to the Viennese composers, including Mozart, Beethoven and Strauss, and the sumptuous Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace, where Mozart performed aged six. Travel overnight to Venice, and seek out Gelateria Nico in Dorsoduro, which has been serving homemade ice-cream and its famous gianduiotto sundae since 1935. Just over two hours west by rail is Milan, whose magnificent Gothic Duomo took 500 years to build. See Da Vinci\u2019s The Last Supper, a fitting end before the EuroNight sleeper carries you home.

This trip spans eight countries \u2013 a massive dollop of European culture in one tour. Set out to reach Bordeaux before the sun sets, to celebrate the start of your trip with a glass and some charcuterie at wine bar La Ligne Rouge, overlooking the Garonne river, before an evening stroll along the Pont de Pierre, which was commissioned by Napoleon. Then it\u2019s over the Spanish border to San Sebasti\u00e1n in the Basque country, for pintxos and the splendid seafront walk between La Concha and Ondarreta beaches. Next, venture south to Madrid, where restaurant Mercado de la Reina is the spot for generous portions of elaborate tapas.

The comfortable NightJet sleeper train network connects Florence with pretty Salzburg. A network of ice caves 50km away in Werfen is a worthwhile jaunt. Prague, six hours\u2019 ride to the north, is something of a Gothic fairytale. Check out picturesque park Pet\u0159\u00ednsk\u00e9 Sady, Old Town Square and Prague Castle, which dates back to 870 AD. Travel overnight to Krak\u00f3w, a city that \u2013 as well as epic historical sites \u2013 has a buzzing bar scene and hip hangouts such as Forum Przestrzenie on the banks of the Vistula. Further north, in Warsaw, admire the view over the city from the 30th floor of the Palace of Culture and Science.

Another proposes targeting sales of the powerfully addictive drugs at those most at risk: men under 40. As the state of Oklahoma\u2019s multibillion-dollar lawsuit against Johnson &amp; Johnson has unfolded over the past month, the company has struggled to explain marketing strategies its accusers say dangerously misrepresented the risk of opioid addiction to doctors, manipulated medical research, and helped drive an epidemic that has claimed 400,000 lives over the past two decades. Johnson &amp; Johnson profited further as demand for opioids surged by buying poppy growing companies in Australia to supply the raw narcotic for its own medicines and other American drug makers. One expert witness at the forefront of combatting the epidemic, Dr Andrew Kolodny, told the court he had little idea about Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s role until he saw the evidence in the case. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to characterize Johnson &amp; Johnson as a kingpin in our opioid crisis,\u201d he said. Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general, Mike Hunter, is suing Johnson &amp; Johnson for billions of dollars for its alleged part in driving addiction and overdoses in his state in the first full trial of a drug maker over the opioid epidemic. But Hunter\u2019s lawsuit has put the wider industry in the dock, too, by laying out how opioid manufacturers worked together to drive up sales by using their huge resources to influence medical policy and doctor prescribing. Hunter said the strategy was motivated by the industry\u2019s \u201cgreed\u201d as profits surged. The case is being closely watched by a host of opioid makers, drug distributors and pharmacy chains facing more than 2,000 other lawsuits by communities across the country to see if a court is prepared to hold a pharmaceutical firm responsible for the worst drug epidemic in American history. Hunter accuses Johnson &amp; Johnson of joining with other companies to create a false narrative of an epidemic of untreated pain in the US to which opioids were the solution, in part by funding front organizations such as the American Pain Society. The strategy helped drive a surge in opioid prescribing as narcotic painkillers ballooned into a multibillion-dollar-a-year market.

At the core of its defense is the claim that the company was distributing drugs approved by federal agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration, and that it sold a relatively small amount of opioids in Oklahoma that cannot be tied to any specific overdoses. Hunter is painting his case on a much broader canvas by characterizing the company as working in coordination with its rivals to change the narrative around opioids to drive up prescribing across the country so that they all benefitted from a bigger market. Some of the most damning testimony has come from Dr Russell Portenoy, a pain specialist and influential early cheerleader for the wide prescribing of opioids who was a paid adviser to Johnson &amp; Johnson, Purdue and other drug makers. Portenoy told the court that painkiller manufacturers \u201cunderstated the risks of opioids, particularly the risk of abuse, addiction and overdose\u201d to boost sales.

The court was shown Janssen\u2019s 2012 business plan which said that \u201cspeaker programs often trigger first use\u201d of Duragesic. The Oklahoma case is closely watched by other drug firms being sued by towns, cities and counties in nearly 2,000 lawsuits combined in a single action in federal court in Ohio, known as the Multi District Litigation (MDL). Last week, lawyers for the plaintiffs in the MDL proposed that any compensation settlement cover every municipality and county in the US in order to deal with all potential lawsuits at once.

      "body": "<p>Jane Bown took this picture of schoolgirls on a day out at the tennis at Wimbledon for the front page of the <em>Observer</em> on 29 June 1952. It was the hottest day of the year, 85 degrees, and 200 people had been taken to the hospital tent at the tournament, having fainted. The girls were queuing up for ice creams in a break between matches. \u201cWimbledon does not mean only tennis to these girls,\u201d the caption noted. \u201cIt means also a chance to survey the adult world with the sensitive and critical eye of adolescence.\u201d</p> <p>Bown\u2019s own eyes never lost those latter qualities. She took this photograph in the third of her 65 years with the paper; she had already an instinct for the intimate life of a crowd. Her camera would have been drawn to the contrast between the girl in the Hollywood shades and the more conventionally bespectacled girl at her side; she would have inveigled her way into the perfect position to capture that small visual drama without commotion. The idea of \u201cteenagers\u201d had not yet been invented, but the girl\u2019s look offers a premonition of that cultural shift.</p> <p>Wimbledon was not quite so alive to the forces of change. That year <a href=\"https://www.tennisfame.com/hall-of-famers/inductees/frank-sedgman\" title=\"\">Frank Sedgman</a>, the dazzling Australian, won three titles \u2013 singles, doubles and mixed doubles. His triumphs were put down to the fact that he trained in a gym in the closed season, a seriousness that was considered a little unsporting by the All England Club. Sedgman\u2019s only reward for his efforts was a shopping voucher worth a few pounds. He turned professional later that year and was consequently unable to play again at the championships until after 1968, when Wimbledon finally changed its amateur-only rule. <strong> </strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Jane Bown took this picture of schoolgirls on a day out at the tennis at Wimbledon for the front page of the Observer on 29 June 1952. It was the hottest day of the year, 85 degrees, and 200 people had been taken to the hospital tent at the tournament, having fainted. The girls were queuing up for ice creams in a break between matches. \u201cWimbledon does not mean only tennis to these girls,\u201d the caption noted. \u201cIt means also a chance to survey the adult world with the sensitive and critical eye of adolescence.\u201d Bown\u2019s own eyes never lost those latter qualities. She took this photograph in the third of her 65 years with the paper; she had already an instinct for the intimate life of a crowd. Her camera would have been drawn to the contrast between the girl in the Hollywood shades and the more conventionally bespectacled girl at her side; she would have inveigled her way into the perfect position to capture that small visual drama without commotion. The idea of \u201cteenagers\u201d had not yet been invented, but the girl\u2019s look offers a premonition of that cultural shift. Wimbledon was not quite so alive to the forces of change. That year Frank Sedgman, the dazzling Australian, won three titles \u2013 singles, doubles and mixed doubles. His triumphs were put down to the fact that he trained in a gym in the closed season, a seriousness that was considered a little unsporting by the All England Club. Sedgman\u2019s only reward for his efforts was a shopping voucher worth a few pounds. He turned professional later that year and was consequently unable to play again at the championships until after 1968, when Wimbledon finally changed its amateur-only rule.",

The lakefront neighborhood, a mere 14 blocks north to south, is home to a Northwestern University campus and three hospitals. On a late spring day, teens toss footballs and volleyballs as joggers zig-zag with leashed dogs in tow. On a full-length track in front of a pair of highrise condominiums, Kate Gardner jogs. She can\u2019t muster one complaint about life in Streeterville, save for a few weeks of unseasonably cool weather.</p> <p>\u201cI know we\u2019re lucky to be here, and that other people in the city don\u2019t have it so good. It\u2019s totally unfair,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The different health outcomes are multifaceted and correlate to almost every socioeconomic factor. The median income in Streeterville is nearly $100,000 a year, according to the US census. In Englewood, smack dab in the center of Chicago\u2019s Southside, it\u2019s a quarter of that. More than 80% of Streeterville residents have a college degree, compared with 8.2% in Englewood.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the violence and the trauma it brings. Walking down 69th, Rashad stops to point.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s where, freshman year, my 14-year-old friend was killed,\u201d she says. \u201cA stray bullet went straight through the window while she was getting ready for school. And I have to walk past that block.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re constantly having to walk past these traumatic situations. You can literally look at the sidewalk where you\u2019ve once seen blood or people bleed out, and you have to go to school, you have to go to work.\u201d</p> <p>Englewood has long held a reputation as <a href=\"https://wgntv.com/2013/08/25/its-englewood-12-hours-in-one-of-chicagos-most-dangerous-neighborhoods/\">one of Chicago\u2019s most violent</a> neighborhoods. <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-met-chicago-englewood-violence-20171207-story.html\">According to the Chicago Tribune</a>, between 2000 and 2017 there were more than 4,800 shootings here.</p> <p>Erin Vogel, co-executive director of I Grow Chicago, an Englewood-based community nonprofit, says 100% of the children the group works with have lost someone they know to gun violence and have heard gunshots while in their home.</p> <p>\u201c93% of them have literally seen a shooting with their own eyes,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s a young man who I work with who just turned 15, and in his 13th year of life, five of his friends were murdered. He saw two of them.\u201d</p> <p>The violence, of course, drives down life expectancy and health outcomes. But health inequities also drive violence. Take lead poisoning. For decades, Englewood had one of the highest rates of residential lead contamination in the country. Research has shown that lead poisoning in children is associated with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/07/violent-crime-lead-poisoning-british-export\">dramatic spikes</a> in impulsiveness and aggression.</p> <p>\u201cIrreversible brain damage just because of where you live, and you\u2019re too poor to go anywhere else? It\u2019s not fair. You\u2019re cheating kids,\u201d said Rashad, now executive director of Imagine Englewood If, a community group founded largely to draw attention to the lead crisis.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t always this way.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a Mecca!\u201d exclaims lifelong resident Djanie Edwards, rattling through a list of vanished community anchors like the Sears store and the old Empress theatre. Everyone who remembers the community before the decay of the 1980s and 1990s points to the abandonment as perhaps the biggest change.</p> <p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t all these open lots everywhere, these were houses,\u201d Edwards says, at the headquarters of Resident Association of Greater Englewood (Rage), the only occupied building on its block. In seven lots, only two structures are standing.</p> <p>Edwards remembers a time before local jobs began to move overseas, like at the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/14/hillary-clinton-chicago-nabisco-factory-workers-job-cuts\"> Nabisco bakery</a> where Rashad\u2019s father worked most of his life. Unemployment opened the door to drugs, drugs fostered an environment of violence, the community fell into poor health and dysfunction.</p> <p>\u201cWhen cocaine hit there was such a rapid decline, and it affected individuals across the spectrum,\u201d said Rodney Johnson, whose family arrived in the community in 1966. He was one of many who left in the 1980s but he has now returned, in part to deploy his skills as a public health researcher.</p> <p>Johnson is one member of a team of \u201ccommunity health navigators\u201d who this week began conducting a door-to-door survey. One of the most pressing questions they\u2019re trying to answer is why there seems to be a disconnect between services that are actually available in the community and residents who do not use them.</p> <p>\u201cThe ironic thing is there are a lot of health resources available here,\u201d said Cecile De Mello of Teamwork Englewood, one of the community groups involved in the research. \u201cWe want to know what are the barriers to people taking advantage of care opportunities in the community.

      "body": "<p>A trade war followed by a currency war. Tariffs used as a protectionist weapon followed by attempts to secure a competitive advantage by exchange rate manipulation. That was the story of the 1930s and, the way things are shaping up, it could easily be the story of the 2020s as well.</p> <p>Consider the historical parallels. In 1930, the US Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley Act, which raised tariffs on imported goods. The next year, Britain became the first major country to come off the gold standard. <a href=\"https://economia.icaew.com/features/january-2015/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-pound\" title=\"\">Sterling quickly lost 25% of its value</a> against the US dollar, making British exports cheaper on world markets. But the full benefits were short-lived. Soon after being sworn in as president in 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt unpegged the dollar from gold, eroding Britain\u2019s advantage.</p> <p>In early 2018, Donald Trump announced that he was putting tariffs on imported aluminium and steel \u2013 the opening shot in a trade war that has seen the US and China engage in tit-for-tat action over the past year.</p> <p>Last week, the outgoing president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, dropped the clearest of hints that fresh stimulus to boost both growth and inflation in the eurozone was on the way. Financial markets had been slow to pick up on the change in the ECB\u2019s thinking, so Draghi reprised his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/26/euro-irreversible-mario-draghi-ecb\" title=\"\">\u201cwhatever it takes\u201d</a> speech in 2012 to make sure everybody got the message: interest rates will be cut and quantitative easing will be resumed.</p> <p>Draghi\u2019s comments had two immediate effects: the euro dropped like a stone against the dollar and Trump got extremely upset. The weaker euro, Trump said, would make it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/18/donald-trump-attacks-ecb-for-currency-manipulation\" title=\"\">\u201cunfairly easier\u201d</a> for the Europeans to compete against the US: \u201cThey have been getting away with this for years, along with China and others.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If one currency is depreciating, another currency must be appreciating</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As with Draghi, Trump\u2019s message could scarcely have been clearer. The US sees the EU as just as big a threat as China, and is prepared to open up a second front in the trade war. Within 36 hours, the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, had signalled that it too was planning to cut interest rates and the euro regained much of the ground it had lost after Draghi\u2019s intervention.</p> <p>Make no mistake, this has the potential to turn nasty. Trump was already agitated about the size of Germany\u2019s trade surplus with the US and has argued \u2013 correctly \u2013 that the eurozone\u2019s biggest economy has been aided in achieving this by a weak euro. Pushing down the value of the single currency still further was bound to rattle the president\u2019s cage.</p> <p>Under the rules that govern the dealings of the G7\u2019s group of central banks, countries are not allowed to deliberately devalue their currencies to secure a competitive advantage. So Draghi was obliged to say that the ECB was acting for purely domestic reasons.</p> <p>But this was casuistry. The eurozone is heavily export-dependent and has been hard hit by the slowdown in the global economy seen over the past year. Loosening monetary policy through lower interest rates and QE has the knock-on effect of making it easier for European exporters to win orders in tough times \u2013 and Draghi knows it.</p> <p>But if one currency is depreciating, another currency must be appreciating. The Japanese want a weak yen; the Chinese desire a competitive yuan; the Europeans are eager for the euro to be lower; and Trump is opposed to the idea of a stronger dollar. As was eventually understood in the 1930s, beggar-thy-neighbour currency devaluation is a zero-sum game that is extremely hard to win.</p> <h2>Bad taste left by cut-price 737 deal</h2> <p>The clear Paris airshow showstopper was news that British Airways\u2019 owner, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/18/british-airlines-parent-iag-reveals-plans-buy-200-boeing-737-max-jets\" title=\"\">IAG, would buy 200 of Boeing\u2019s grounded 737 Max planes</a> \u2013 a move that infuriated rival Airbus, which had not been invited to tender for the IAG fleet expansion, and lifted Boeing from the doldrums. With the 737 Max yet to be certified safe to fly again, it came at a bargain price for IAG, substantially less than the $24bn the planes should notionally cost.</p> <p>The aircraft is grounded, lest we forget, because 346 passengers and crew lost their lives in two crashes. Investigators in Indonesia had already named one likely cause of the Lion Air disaster: MCAS, an anti-stall system that had been implemented because the aircraft had changed \u2013 but not changed enough, Boeing and regulators decided, to require the expensive retraining of pilots. But then came the next 737 Max crash, in Ethiopia.</p> <p>The world of aviation is full of businesses who like to say that safety is their number one priority \u2013 a pious pledge that is self-evidently not literally true. What is true is that for an individual airline to be seen to deliberately cut corners is commercially disastrous; even Ryanair, in the years when it revelled in its own negative publicity, would immediately stamp on any hint that its flights were in any way less safe than those of other airlines.</p> <p>But passenger confidence in modern aviation has been knocked, badly, by the latest disasters, and questions remain. British Airways\u2019 planes will be delivered years after the 737 Max returns to the skies, and the Paris deal remains a \u201cletter of intent\u201d rather than a firm order. For all that, there is a whiff of indecency about an arrangement that saves money for IAG at the cost of affirming the 737 Max\u2019s safety before the regulators have done so, and while passengers\u2019 remains still lie in a field in Ethiopia.</p> <h2>Will a climate divestment drive wake up the world\u2019s biggest polluters?</h2> <p>The UK\u2019s largest money manager is putting \u00a31 trillion where its mouth is. Last week Legal and General Investment Management <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/21/us-climate-crisis-legal-and-general-investment-management\" title=\"\">publicly shamed five of the world\u2019s worst climate villains</a>, in one of the City\u2019s most strident climate divestment drives yet.</p> <p>It will sweep these carbon-intensive companies, including US oil giant ExxonMobil, from 19 ethical funds representing \u00a35bn of environmentally conscientious investment. This is a fraction of L&amp;G\u2019s total financial heft, but the rest of its shareholder clout \u2013 it will retain investments in these companies in its other funds \u2013 will be used to vote against the boards of climate laggards at each successive AGM.</p> <p>L&amp;G calls this \u201cengagement with consequences\u201d. The money manager expects companies in the world\u2019s most polluting industries \u2013 fossil fuels, food retailing, agriculture and finance \u2013 to come clean on their carbon emissions and set targets to drive them down.</p> <p>The approach has been welcomed by green investment activists as an important weapon in the complex battle against climate breakdown.</p> <p>ExxonMobil is the first oil super-major to come under fire for failing to meet these basic demands.

      "bodyText": "A trade war followed by a currency war. Tariffs used as a protectionist weapon followed by attempts to secure a competitive advantage by exchange rate manipulation. That was the story of the 1930s and, the way things are shaping up, it could easily be the story of the 2020s as well. Consider the historical parallels. In 1930, the US Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley Act, which raised tariffs on imported goods. The next year, Britain became the first major country to come off the gold standard. Sterling quickly lost 25% of its value against the US dollar, making British exports cheaper on world markets. But the full benefits were short-lived. Soon after being sworn in as president in 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt unpegged the dollar from gold, eroding Britain\u2019s advantage. In early 2018, Donald Trump announced that he was putting tariffs on imported aluminium and steel \u2013 the opening shot in a trade war that has seen the US and China engage in tit-for-tat action over the past year. Last week, the outgoing president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, dropped the clearest of hints that fresh stimulus to boost both growth and inflation in the eurozone was on the way. Financial markets had been slow to pick up on the change in the ECB\u2019s thinking, so Draghi reprised his \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d speech in 2012 to make sure everybody got the message: interest rates will be cut and quantitative easing will be resumed. Draghi\u2019s comments had two immediate effects: the euro dropped like a stone against the dollar and Trump got extremely upset. The weaker euro, Trump said, would make it \u201cunfairly easier\u201d for the Europeans to compete against the US: \u201cThey have been getting away with this for years, along with China and others.\u201d As with Draghi, Trump\u2019s message could scarcely have been clearer. The US sees the EU as just as big a threat as China, and is prepared to open up a second front in the trade war. Within 36 hours, the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, had signalled that it too was planning to cut interest rates and the euro regained much of the ground it had lost after Draghi\u2019s intervention. Make no mistake, this has the potential to turn nasty. Trump was already agitated about the size of Germany\u2019s trade surplus with the US and has argued \u2013 correctly \u2013 that the eurozone\u2019s biggest economy has been aided in achieving this by a weak euro. Pushing down the value of the single currency still further was bound to rattle the president\u2019s cage. Under the rules that govern the dealings of the G7\u2019s group of central banks, countries are not allowed to deliberately devalue their currencies to secure a competitive advantage. So Draghi was obliged to say that the ECB was acting for purely domestic reasons. But this was casuistry. The eurozone is heavily export-dependent and has been hard hit by the slowdown in the global economy seen over the past year. Loosening monetary policy through lower interest rates and QE has the knock-on effect of making it easier for European exporters to win orders in tough times \u2013 and Draghi knows it. But if one currency is depreciating, another currency must be appreciating. The Japanese want a weak yen; the Chinese desire a competitive yuan; the Europeans are eager for the euro to be lower; and Trump is opposed to the idea of a stronger dollar. As was eventually understood in the 1930s, beggar-thy-neighbour currency devaluation is a zero-sum game that is extremely hard to win. Bad taste left by cut-price 737 deal The clear Paris airshow showstopper was news that British Airways\u2019 owner, IAG, would buy 200 of Boeing\u2019s grounded 737 Max planes \u2013 a move that infuriated rival Airbus, which had not been invited to tender for the IAG fleet expansion, and lifted Boeing from the doldrums. With the 737 Max yet to be certified safe to fly again, it came at a bargain price for IAG, substantially less than the $24bn the planes should notionally cost. The aircraft is grounded, lest we forget, because 346 passengers and crew lost their lives in two crashes. Investigators in Indonesia had already named one likely cause of the Lion Air disaster: MCAS, an anti-stall system that had been implemented because the aircraft had changed \u2013 but not changed enough, Boeing and regulators decided, to require the expensive retraining of pilots. But then came the next 737 Max crash, in Ethiopia. The world of aviation is full of businesses who like to say that safety is their number one priority \u2013 a pious pledge that is self-evidently not literally true. What is true is that for an individual airline to be seen to deliberately cut corners is commercially disastrous; even Ryanair, in the years when it revelled in its own negative publicity, would immediately stamp on any hint that its flights were in any way less safe than those of other airlines. But passenger confidence in modern aviation has been knocked, badly, by the latest disasters, and questions remain. British Airways\u2019 planes will be delivered years after the 737 Max returns to the skies, and the Paris deal remains a \u201cletter of intent\u201d rather than a firm order. For all that, there is a whiff of indecency about an arrangement that saves money for IAG at the cost of affirming the 737 Max\u2019s safety before the regulators have done so, and while passengers\u2019 remains still lie in a field in Ethiopia. Will a climate divestment drive wake up the world\u2019s biggest polluters? The UK\u2019s largest money manager is putting \u00a31 trillion where its mouth is. Last week Legal and General Investment Management publicly shamed five of the world\u2019s worst climate villains, in one of the City\u2019s most strident climate divestment drives yet. It will sweep these carbon-intensive companies, including US oil giant ExxonMobil, from 19 ethical funds representing \u00a35bn of environmentally conscientious investment. This is a fraction of L&amp;G\u2019s total financial heft, but the rest of its shareholder clout \u2013 it will retain investments in these companies in its other funds \u2013 will be used to vote against the boards of climate laggards at each successive AGM. L&amp;G calls this \u201cengagement with consequences\u201d. The money manager expects companies in the world\u2019s most polluting industries \u2013 fossil fuels, food retailing, agriculture and finance \u2013 to come clean on their carbon emissions and set targets to drive them down. The approach has been welcomed by green investment activists as an important weapon in the complex battle against climate breakdown. ExxonMobil is the first oil super-major to come under fire for failing to meet these basic demands. By contrast, European oil giants Shell and BP have avoided being named and shamed by agreeing to disclose their contribution to the world\u2019s growing carbon emissions, and setting targets to reduce them. So is big oil free to pollute, as long as it confesses its sins and vows to try harder? Not quite. L&amp;G insists these rules of engagement are already yielding powerful results. It plans to escalate its demands in the years ahead too; accepting responsibility for climate emissions is only the start. The fund admits that talk is meaningless without action, and engagement is meaningless without consequences. The question is whether this is enough to rouse the boards of the world\u2019s most polluting companies to urgent action before it is too late.",

He has consistently cited the era of racists like Strom Thurmond and James Eastland as a time of greater \u201cunity\u201d and \u201ccivility\u201d that we could learn lessons from. Back then, he has said, \u201cthe political system worked.\u201d Biden gave a warm and effusive eulogy for Thurmond at his 2003 funeral, saying it he had been \u201chonored\u201d to work with a man who once <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SG-clHmRqo0\">declared</a> that the \u201cnigger race\u201d would never be admitted to Southern institutions.</p> <p>Thurmond himself said that he had no regrets about his racist history, but Biden called him a \u201cspecial man\u201d of \u201cgrace\u201d and \u201chumility.\u201d Biden infamously worked with James Eastland on anti-busing legislation. Eastland was even worse than Thurmond. He degraded black soldiers who fought Hitler as physically and morally incompetent and said that \u201cracial separation was the correct, self-evident truth\u201d and the \u201claw of God\u201d.</p> <p>It might be surprising to hear Biden talk this way about figures who spent their lives trying to deny black citizens their basic rights. But from the time of his arrival in the Senate in 1973, Biden has held a romanticized view of Washington politics, one in which clashes of political interests are mere \u201cfriendly disagreements\u201d between people who are all fundamentally good. This view has allowed Biden to treat white supremacists as his friends. He has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/10/06/back-on-the-trail-bidens-message-rankles-the-left/?utm_term=.ad49a1b5637b\">expressed nostalgia</a> for the time when the Senate consisted almost entirely of white men who resolved their problems civilly over a meal.</p> <p>In an excellent<em> </em><a href=\"https://harpers.org/archive/2019/03/joe-biden-record/\">summary</a> of Biden\u2019s career in Harper\u2019s, Andrew Cockburn calls Biden the \u201chigh priest of the doctrine that our legislative problems derive merely from superficial disagreements, rather than fundamental differences over matters of principle\u201d, the sort who believes \u201cpolitical divisions can be settled by men endowed with statesmanlike vision and goodwill\u201d. Biden constantly talks about the need to \u201cend the divisive partisan politics that is ripping this country apart.\u201d He has distinguished himself from the \u201cpartisan\u201d Democrats by saying that he doesn\u2019t \u201cthink we should look on Republicans as our enemies\u201d.</p> <p>Indeed, his commitment to bipartisanship stretches so far that Biden has been willing to help Republicans defeat their Democratic opponents. Biden once <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/us/politics/biden-speech-fred-upton.html\">accepted</a> $200,000 to give a speech in support of Republican Fred Upton, who was in a difficult fight against a Democratic challenger.</p> <p>Biden has <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/05/17/remarks-vice-president-yale-university-class-day\">told</a> a story that explains his willingness to \u201ccross the aisle\u201d and maintain close relations with repulsive political figures. Once upon a time, he thought Jesse Helms (another vicious segregationist) was a bad person for opposing an early version of the Americans With Disabilities Act. He assumed Helms didn\u2019t care about disabled people. But then he found out that Helms himself had adopted a disabled son. Since then, Biden said:</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you\u2019re all smiles and flattery, you are not really committed to a set of progressive political values</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><em>Never once have I questioned another man\u2019s or woman\u2019s motive. Because when you question a man\u2019s motive, when you say they\u2019re acting out of greed, they\u2019re in the pocket of an interest group, et cetera, it\u2019s awful hard to reach consensus. It\u2019s awful hard having to reach across the table and shake hands.</em></p> <p>Nothing better captures the philosophy of the Washington insider. It explains why Biden made a perfect vice-president for Barack Obama. Obama\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2019/03/the-obama-boys\">political approach</a> was similarly based on the idea that \u201cour\u201d differences are minor compared to our similarities, and together we could set aside partisanship to <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2019/02/the-kind-of-policy-we-must-never-make-again\">privatize the school system</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Commission_on_Fiscal_Responsibility_and_Reform\">cut social security</a>.</p> <p>To a certain extent, this philosophy \u201cworks\u201d \u2013 Bill Clinton did manage to get his agenda passed, because his agenda was crime control, welfare reduction, the \u201cdefense of marriage\u201d. and bank deregulation. But while it eliminates \u201cdivision\u201d it also abandons the entire fight necessary to advance progressive change. You can be everybody in Washington\u2019s best buddy, or you can move the country toward justice, but you cannot do both. This is because there are powerful political figures standing in the way of justice, and the steps you need to take are going to alienate them. Biden\u2019s career is best understood as what happens when a person who is not actively evil decides to prioritize chumminess and conformity over taking difficult moral stands.</p> <p>From the very start, Biden was making indefensible compromises and standing up for what was wrong. In the 1970s, as Asher Smith has <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/04/joe-bidens-record-on-racial-integration-is-indefensible\">documented</a>, Biden opposed efforts to racially integrate the American school system. He lamented that busing \u201chas been an issue that has been in the hands of the racists, and we liberals have rejected because \u2018if George Wallace is for it, it must be bad\u2019.\u201d Biden proudly said that by breaking with other members of his party on the issue, \u201cI\u2019ve made it \u2014 if not respectable \u2013 I\u2019ve made it reasonable for longstanding liberals to begin to raise the questions I\u2019ve been the first to raise in the liberal community here on the [Senate] floor.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/19/joe-biden-segregationist-senators-criticism\">Biden clashes with 2020 rivals over his work with segregationist senators</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the 1980s, Biden <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/08/biden-crime-mass-incarceration-police-prisons\">became</a> a \u201ctough on crime\u201d Democrat. He wrote the first version of the notorious Clinton crime bill, even encouraging Clinton to \u201cmaintain crime as a Democratic initiative\u201d. Biden \u201cunblushingly cited his and Thurmond\u2019s leading role in enacting laws allowing for the execution of drug dealers convicted of homicide, and expanding the practice of civil asset forfeiture, law enforcement\u2019s plunder of property belonging to people suspected of crimes, even if they are neither charged nor convicted\u201d. He warned of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/07/politics/biden-1993-speech-predators/index.html\">predators on our streets</a>\u201d that were beyond hope of rehabilitation and simply needed to be cordoned off from the rest of society.</p> <p>Biden was deeply proud of his role in cracking down on crime; a staffer recalling him saying: \u201cWhenever people hear the words \u2018drugs\u2019 and \u2018crime,\u2019 I want them to think \u2018Joe Biden.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6aeef556d9c768d027e91f13def460f840eb18cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6aeef556d9c768d027e91f13def460f840eb18cb/0_0_3256_2384/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Biden with Obama at a presidential rally in August 2008.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"732\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Biden with Obama at a presidential rally in August 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: M. Spencer Green/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unfortunately, Biden\u2019s \u201cDC chumminess\u201d has characterized his entire career. He has long declined to take morally necessary stands that might alienate powerful people, preferring to be friends with \u201ceverybody.\u201d This is only possible, of course, because Biden has rarely had to encounter the people outside that \u201ceverybody\u201d \u2013 the Iraqis blown to pieces thanks to his Iraq war vote, the children thrown in prison thanks to his crime bill.</p> <p>The problem here is not Biden\u2019s \u201cbipartisanship\u201d. Sometimes you have to work with people whose values you find repellent. Finding points of common interest is basic political political pragmatism (see, for example, the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/12/12/676152310/senate-poised-to-vote-to-end-u-s-military-support-for-war-in-yemen\">bipartisan Yemen resolution</a> shepherded through the Senate by Bernie Sanders). The problem comes when you get so close to the powerful, and spend so long around them, that you cease to be disgusted by disgusting things. At this point, \u201cfriendliness\u201d just means a lack of moral seriousness. To be <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/bidens-cozy-relations-with-bank-industry-825\">chummy with banks</a> is to be cruel to bankrupt debtors. To be chummy with Mike Pence is to be cruel to LGBT people. There come times when you have to take a stand, when you have to give your answer to that old labor question: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XEnTxlBuGo\">Which Side Are You On?</a></p> <p>Biden has made it clear that he doesn\u2019t want to think in terms of sides. He tuts, \u201cFolks, that\u2019s not who we are\u201d when he \u201cgets criticized for saying anything nice about a Republican\u201d. Appeals to unity are always dishonest, however, because they are always selective. Can you unify the fossil fuel companies whose profits depend on destruction with the people who will actually suffer the consequences? It always turns out that somebody is excluded from consideration. In Biden\u2019s case, while he speaks lovingly about the patriotism of the rich, he\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mbpxx8/biden-trashes-millennials-in-his-quest-to-become-even-less-likable\">nothing but contemptuous</a> for indebted millennials:</p> <p><em>The younger generation now tells me how tough things are \u2014 give me a break. No, no, I have no empathy for it, give me a break.</em></p> <p>Ultimately, the Biden approach to politics is a bankrupt one. If you\u2019re all smiles and flattery, you are not really committed to a set of progressive political values. As Biden himself recently said to a room full of wealthy people, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2019/06/19/joe-biden-to-rich-donors-nothing-would-fundamentally-change-if-hes-elected/\">nothing would fundamentally change</a>\u201d if he was elected.</p> <p>But we do not need leaders who want to be everybody\u2019s friend, we need leaders who know who their friends are and in whose interest power needs to be exercised. You can\u2019t be everybody\u2019s chum.</p> <ul> <li><p>Nathan Robinson is the editor of Current Affairs, where a longer version of this article <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2019/03/everybodys-chum\">originally appeared</a></p></li> </ul>",

Biden once accepted $200,000 to give a speech in support of Republican Fred Upton, who was in a difficult fight against a Democratic challenger. Biden has told a story that explains his willingness to \u201ccross the aisle\u201d and maintain close relations with repulsive political figures. Once upon a time, he thought Jesse Helms (another vicious segregationist) was a bad person for opposing an early version of the Americans With Disabilities Act. He assumed Helms didn\u2019t care about disabled people. But then he found out that Helms himself had adopted a disabled son. Since then, Biden said: Never once have I questioned another man\u2019s or woman\u2019s motive. Because when you question a man\u2019s motive, when you say they\u2019re acting out of greed, they\u2019re in the pocket of an interest group, et cetera, it\u2019s awful hard to reach consensus. It\u2019s awful hard having to reach across the table and shake hands. Nothing better captures the philosophy of the Washington insider. It explains why Biden made a perfect vice-president for Barack Obama. Obama\u2019s political approach was similarly based on the idea that \u201cour\u201d differences are minor compared to our similarities, and together we could set aside partisanship to privatize the school system and cut social security. To a certain extent, this philosophy \u201cworks\u201d \u2013 Bill Clinton did manage to get his agenda passed, because his agenda was crime control, welfare reduction, the \u201cdefense of marriage\u201d. and bank deregulation. But while it eliminates \u201cdivision\u201d it also abandons the entire fight necessary to advance progressive change. You can be everybody in Washington\u2019s best buddy, or you can move the country toward justice, but you cannot do both. This is because there are powerful political figures standing in the way of justice, and the steps you need to take are going to alienate them. Biden\u2019s career is best understood as what happens when a person who is not actively evil decides to prioritize chumminess and conformity over taking difficult moral stands. From the very start, Biden was making indefensible compromises and standing up for what was wrong. In the 1970s, as Asher Smith has documented, Biden opposed efforts to racially integrate the American school system. He lamented that busing \u201chas been an issue that has been in the hands of the racists, and we liberals have rejected because \u2018if George Wallace is for it, it must be bad\u2019.\u201d Biden proudly said that by breaking with other members of his party on the issue, \u201cI\u2019ve made it \u2014 if not respectable \u2013 I\u2019ve made it reasonable for longstanding liberals to begin to raise the questions I\u2019ve been the first to raise in the liberal community here on the [Senate] floor.\u201d In the 1980s, Biden became a \u201ctough on crime\u201d Democrat. He wrote the first version of the notorious Clinton crime bill, even encouraging Clinton to \u201cmaintain crime as a Democratic initiative\u201d. Biden \u201cunblushingly cited his and Thurmond\u2019s leading role in enacting laws allowing for the execution of drug dealers convicted of homicide, and expanding the practice of civil asset forfeiture, law enforcement\u2019s plunder of property belonging to people suspected of crimes, even if they are neither charged nor convicted\u201d. He warned of \u201cpredators on our streets\u201d that were beyond hope of rehabilitation and simply needed to be cordoned off from the rest of society. Biden was deeply proud of his role in cracking down on crime; a staffer recalling him saying: \u201cWhenever people hear the words \u2018drugs\u2019 and \u2018crime,\u2019 I want them to think \u2018Joe Biden.\u2019\u201d Unfortunately, Biden\u2019s \u201cDC chumminess\u201d has characterized his entire career. He has long declined to take morally necessary stands that might alienate powerful people, preferring to be friends with \u201ceverybody.\u201d This is only possible, of course, because Biden has rarely had to encounter the people outside that \u201ceverybody\u201d \u2013 the Iraqis blown to pieces thanks to his Iraq war vote, the children thrown in prison thanks to his crime bill. The problem here is not Biden\u2019s \u201cbipartisanship\u201d. Sometimes you have to work with people whose values you find repellent. Finding points of common interest is basic political political pragmatism (see, for example, the bipartisan Yemen resolution shepherded through the Senate by Bernie Sanders). The problem comes when you get so close to the powerful, and spend so long around them, that you cease to be disgusted by disgusting things. At this point, \u201cfriendliness\u201d just means a lack of moral seriousness. To be chummy with banks is to be cruel to bankrupt debtors. To be chummy with Mike Pence is to be cruel to LGBT people. There come times when you have to take a stand, when you have to give your answer to that old labor question: Which Side Are You On? Biden has made it clear that he doesn\u2019t want to think in terms of sides. He tuts, \u201cFolks, that\u2019s not who we are\u201d when he \u201cgets criticized for saying anything nice about a Republican\u201d. Appeals to unity are always dishonest, however, because they are always selective. Can you unify the fossil fuel companies whose profits depend on destruction with the people who will actually suffer the consequences? It always turns out that somebody is excluded from consideration. In Biden\u2019s case, while he speaks lovingly about the patriotism of the rich, he\u2019s nothing but contemptuous for indebted millennials: The younger generation now tells me how tough things are \u2014 give me a break. No, no, I have no empathy for it, give me a break. Ultimately, the Biden approach to politics is a bankrupt one. If you\u2019re all smiles and flattery, you are not really committed to a set of progressive political values. As Biden himself recently said to a room full of wealthy people, \u201cnothing would fundamentally change\u201d if he was elected. But we do not need leaders who want to be everybody\u2019s friend, we need leaders who know who their friends are and in whose interest power needs to be exercised. You can\u2019t be everybody\u2019s chum. Nathan Robinson is the editor of Current Affairs, where a longer version of this article originally appeared",

Democrats, meanwhile, always seem a step behind. They\u2019re fighting the uphill battle to win back gerrymandered legislatures, and fighting partisan gerrymanders in the courts. Meanwhile, Hofeller and the Republican aim to change the entire paradigm yet again, with this shift to citizen voting-age population. Hofeller never intended to leave a digital smoking gun. He always cautioned against leaving any digital trail that could later haunt the Republican Party in court. \u201cThe e in email,\u201d he lectured, \u201cstands for eternal.\u201d But now that these digital files from the grave have shown the real motivation behind the census question and Republican gerrymanders, it\u2019s more important than ever for the courts to defend democracy - and the crucial notion of one person, one vote - against the pernicious efforts of determined partisans to entrench their own power, no matter the price to our nation\u2019s ideals.

      "body": "<p>There\u2019s something vertiginous about the speed with which the political climate has soured over the past decade. From an era of falling walls and blurred borders, of globalisation celebrated as an economic tide that would lift all ships, we are now witnessing a backlash of startling viciousness. Narratives of migration have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/16/nigel-farage-defends-ukip-breaking-point-poster-queue-of-migrants\" title=\"\">co-opted by rightwing politicians </a>and their media cheerleaders, who discard both facts and human rights in their efforts to conjure old fears of invasion and cultural subjugation. Literary responses to political crises generally take years to percolate through \u2013 JK Galbraith\u2019s definitive <em>The Great Crash, 1929</em> was published in 1955 \u2013 but such is the urgency of the present moment that already there are a host of books, both fiction and nonfiction, seeking to redress the narrative imbalance around the refugee crisis and immigration more broadly.</p> <p>Dina Nayeri\u2019s <strong>The Ungrateful Refugee</strong> is a work of astonishing, insistent importance. Like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/20/hisham-matar-english-books-are-often-overrated-it-is-boring-and-dangerous\" title=\"\">Hisham Matar</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/27/the-refugees-viet-thanh-nguyen-review\" title=\"\">Viet Thanh Nguyen</a>, Nayeri speaks firsthand of the refugee experience. She was born in Tehran in 1979, the year of the Islamic Revolution. Her mother was a proselytising Christian, and she soon found herself fleeing Iran for the Middle East, then Italy.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/15/return-to-refugee-camps-30-years-on-dina-nayeri\" title=\"\"> She was interned at Barba</a>, a camp in a dilapidated hotel near Rome.

Everyone has one, having just slipped out from the grip of a nightmare.\u201d This is a book full of revelatory truths, moments where we are plunged deeply and painfully into the quotidian experience of the refugee. Refugees are trapped in the perpetual present: \u201cThe future brings anxiety because you don\u2019t belong and can\u2019t move forward. The past brings depression, because you can\u2019t go home, your memories fade and everything you know is gone.\u201d She visits a tent in a Greek camp whose occupants maintain it scrupulously. \u201cIt seems heroic to me, every scavenged and scrubbed item, the toil to keep her family\u2019s dignity in this wasteland.\u201d She notices that instead of pictures, they have teddy bears pinned to the wall. In a place where they need blankets and schoolbooks, there is a surfeit of stuffed bears. \u201cThey overflow from the donation bins.

She recognises that the immediate migrant crisis is masking a deeper issue, the need to treat with dignity those to whom we offer refuge; not to demand assimilation, but to recognise the integrity of their otherness. \u201cRefugees have no agency,\u201d Nayeri says. \u201cOften, they are so broken, they beg to be remade into the image of the native.\u201d It is through writing that Nayeri has managed to \u201cundo the excesses of my assimilation\u201d. It\u2019s a powerful message about the need for such stories in a world that is suffering a collective failure of the sympathetic imagination, where political regimes and rabid rightwing media seek to portray migrants as an abstract, threatening mass, rather than a patchwork of individual lives.</p> <p>Ali Smith\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/19/spring-ali-smith-review\" title=\"\">luminous latest novel, </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/19/spring-ali-smith-review\" title=\"\">Spring</a></em>, draws deeply on her participation in <strong>Refugee Tales</strong>, <a href=\"http://refugeetales.org/\" title=\"\">a project launched in 2014 by the poet David Herd</a> to draw attention to the voiceless hordes trapped within Britain\u2019s byzantine immigration system.

Constantine gives voice to M, a traumatised child from Sierra Leone whose parents were killed in the civil war. M came to England, was adopted, grew to be a young man, fell in love, and worked hard to provide for his girlfriend, for her daughter. Then \u201ca clean white hand approaches and between thumb and finger takes hold of the end of a thread and delicately pulls.

In <strong>Our City</strong>, the historian and urban policy specialist Jon Bloomfield uses a collage of migrant voices to tell the story of the making of modern Birmingham. Bloomfield has carried out dozens of interviews across several generations of the city\u2019s migrant population; this is a book that speaks of the hope and courage of those who came to Birmingham in the 50s and 60s, when the UK government advertised in newspapers from Jamaica to Pakistan seeking workers for its burgeoning industrial enterprises. Bloomfield delves into each of the city\u2019s immigrant communities \u2013 those from Kashmir, from the Caribbean, from eastern Europe and China \u2013 as they live through the rise and fall of British industry, the closure of Longbridge and the other car plants that employed a huge proportion of Birmingham\u2019s workforce. In tight, energetic prose, Bloomfield shows how Birmingham\u2019s second and third-generation migrant population embraced the move to a service economy and now look forward to the future with optimism noticeably lacking elsewhere in the country.</p> <p>Jonathan Portes is an economist and academic who wrote a New Labour-commissioned study on the impact of immigration in Britain in 2001. In his short, sharp and compelling book <strong>What Do We Know and What Should We Do About Immigration?</strong>, he uses the fissures exposed by Brexit as an opportunity to carry out a historical survey of British attitudes to migrants, then to contemplate the current state of discourse in the country. The message of the book is clear \u2013 in a war of competing narratives, the line on immigration pedalled by the rightwing press cannot be allowed to stand. An ideological battle must be fought with facts and stories that counter the dominant representation of migrants as a threat to economic stability and societal cohesion.</p> <p>In telling the story of Britain\u2019s historical engagement with others, Portes draws on Robert Winder\u2019s consummate <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jun/12/history.highereducation\" title=\"\">Bloody Foreigners </a></em>(2004), demonstrating the cycles of openness and insularity that have ebbed, flowed and coexisted over the past millennium. It\u2019s evident, he says, that \u201cpolitical controversy over (and hostility to) immigration is anything but new\u201d. He notes that <em>The Merchant of Venice</em> was written at a time when Jews were still not officially allowed into England. He cites the 1884 novel <em>Simiocracy</em> by Conservative MP Arthur Brookfield, which imagines a future where the Liberal government keeps itself in power by extending the franchise to apes and importing millions of African gorillas. There\u2019s Oswald Mosley and the BUF, Enoch Powell and the rivers of blood, the Smethwick election of 1964, in which the Conservatives won on the strapline \u201cIf you want a nigger for a neighbour, vote Labour.\u201d Then we have Theresa May\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/10/immigration-bill-theresa-may-hostile-environment\" title=\"\"> \u201chostile environment</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/10/immigration-bill-theresa-may-hostile-environment\" title=\"\">\u201d,</a> the rise of Ukip, and Brexit.</p> <p>Alongside this insularity and xenophobia, Portes tells another story: one of a country that embraces others and is built on the labour of immigrants, from the waves of Protestant refugees in the wake of the Spanish Inquisition, to the Huguenots, the Irish, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/16/windrush-scandal-the-long-betrayal-archived-documents-david-olusoga\" title=\"\">Windrush generation</a>, east African Asians and those from Bangladesh and Pakistan. Portes notes that in the 16th century, there were immigration processing centres much like those we have now, where immigrants were \u201callotted to various areas for settlement\u201d. This was not a reflection of their undesirability, though, but rather \u201cthe need to take maximum advantage of this economic opportunity\u201d. Britain has always been a refuge for those fleeing political persecution \u2013 among them Garibaldi, Giuseppe Mazzini, Napoleon III, Victor Hugo, Karl Marx.</p> <p>The book draws on a great deal of evidence to prove that immigration contributes positively to the British economy. \u201cImmigrants do not take our jobs,\u201d writes Portes, \u201cnor do they make us poorer. Fears about the wider impact of immigration \u2013 on public services, crime or \u2018cohesion\u2019 \u2013 are overstated.\u201d One of the problems, he argues, is that it has been politically expedient for the Conservative government to commingle two separate issues \u2013 austerity and immigration, a \u201cshifting of the blame from political decisions on the allocation of resources to immigration\u201d. He cites several studies that illustrate the lack of correlation between Ukip support and local levels of immigration, but a high correlation between austerity-related spending cuts and rises in support for the party. Brexit and the concomitant rise in extremism, Portes claims, are the direct result of the government\u2019s attempts to rebalance the books in the wake of the financial crash. He ends on an upbeat note, claiming that \u201cpublic attitudes to immigration in the UK are at their most positive in decades\u201d.</p> <p>Despite the positivity of Bloomfield and Portes, it\u2019s hard to look at the regimes of Trump and Orb\u00e1n, the rise of Marine Le Pen and Nigel Farage, the persecution of minorities in Burma, Cameroon, Xinjiang and elsewhere, and not to feel that these are dark days we\u2019re living through, that we\u2019re less open, more inward-looking, less accepting of others than at any time in living memory. Nationalism, xenophobia, human rights, hospitality \u2013 these are both the stories we tell about ourselves and how we define ourselves in relation to others. It is these stories that shape the geopolitical world, that give us licence to welcome or reject those who come to us in need. One of the striking messages from this timely collection of books is that political systems are set up to treat people in general, rather than individually, and yet each story, each life, demands to be read, to be acknowledged, on its own particular terms. In ignoring them, we allow the story of immigration bellowed by the rightwing press and self-interested politicians to be the only story.</p> <p><em>\u2022 The Ungrateful Refugee </em>by Dina Nayeri is published by Canongate (\u00a316.99).

In ignoring them, we allow the story of immigration bellowed by the rightwing press and self-interested politicians to be the only story. \u2022 The Ungrateful Refugee by Dina Nayeri is published by Canongate (\u00a316.99).

Last week, Facebook unveiled its crypto plans in a <a href=\"https://libra.org/en-US/white-paper/#introducing-libra\" title=\"\">white paper</a>. It\u2019s called Libra and it is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency\" title=\"\">cryptocurrency</a>, that is to say, \u201ca digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses strong cryptography to secure financial transactions, control the creation of additional units and verify the transfer of assets\u201d.</p> <p>Like bitcoin, then? Er, not exactly. Like bitcoin, Libra does use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain\" title=\"\">blockchain technology,</a> but thereafter the two currencies part company. Whereas the value of bitcoin oscillates like Boris Johnson\u2019s promises, Libra is supposed to be a low-volatility currency that will let its users buy things or send money to people with very low fees. It will be backed by reserves managed by a nonprofit organisation,called the <a href=\"https://libra.org/en-US/association/\" title=\"\">Libra Association</a>, which gives the token real-world value and oversees the governance of the blockchain technology that powers it.</p> <p>This organisation is made up of members who pay an entrance fee of at least $10m to join, which gives them one vote on the governing council and entitles them to a share (proportionate to their investment) of the dividends from interest on the Libra reserve into which users pay their fiat (ie traditional) currencies when buying Libras. Current members of the association include the usual suspects such as Mastercard, PayPal and Visa, five venture capitalist firms, Vodafone and some oddballs such as Uber and outfits you\u2019ve never heard of but which presumably were able to fork out the entrance fee. The association also signs up businesses that are prepared to accept Libra for payment.</p> <p>Here\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to work. You cash in your hard-earned pounds, euros, dollars etc into the Libra reserve, which then \u201cmints\u201d an equivalent amount of Libras (at the prevailing exchange rate). If you decide to cash out by returning your Libras, they are \u201cburned\u201d and you get the equivalent back in pounds, euros, dollars, etc. So all of the available Libras at any point in time remain in circulation, backed by the reserves held by the association. And, in theory at least, you can always get your real money back at an exchange rate that corresponds roughly with that of the basket of currencies held by the reserve.</p> <p>So far, so very unlike bitcoin. And although Facebook came up with the idea \u2013 in theory at least \u2013 it doesn\u2019t control the Libra. It only has one vote on the association council. This is shrewd, given that nobody in their right mind would trust anything controlled by the Zuckerberg empire.</p> <p>The underlying concept of the Libra is breathtakingly ambitious. It is to use the scale and network power of Facebook (which currently has 2.2 billion users) to enable anybody in the world to use a currency that enables them to pay for things and send money in a frictionless manner within \u2013 and across \u2013 territorial boundaries.</p> <p>It\u2019s a bit like PayPal for everyone, including the 1.7 billion of our fellow humans who haven\u2019t a hope in hell of getting a bank account.

Because, while progress has been made, the initiative has been overly reliant on a conventional economic approach that has prioritised city growth, trickle down and property investment-led regeneration. If this policy intervention is to survive, it needs to evolve into a meaningful programme of change. Here in the north, people need to see a change in who holds power, a change that brings economic prosperity for all northerners, and change that creates a fairer region in which to live and work. If Westminster fails to support this change, it will only exacerbate the sense of political and social disconnection that continues to make people feel not just left behind but kept behind. A better north is possible, but it needs a new approach. It cannot simply be about replicating a \u201cnew London in the north\u201d that will simply import the capital\u2019s economic problems \u2013 northerners demand and deserve better. So, five years on from its launch, the northern powerhouse must think beyond big city growth in isolation and recognise the potential of smaller towns, cities and rural areas. And it needs to be driven by northern leaders, with access to real resources, rather than by Westminster. Done right, it could be the means by which to realise the north of England\u2019s huge economic and human potential and would benefit other regions and the UK as a whole. \u2022 Sarah Longlands is director of thinktank IPPR North",

Such an option would make maintaining our historic church no longer automatically most easily achieved through destruction.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.harlemonestop.com/organization/430/all-saints-catholic-church\">All Saints</a>, between 129th and 130th Streets on Madison Avenue, is the most architecturally significant church in Harlem. Deconsecrated and closed in preparation for sale, it is about to meet its fate.</p> <p>All Saints was completed early in the 1900s but it was designed more than 20 years earlier, the final church by James Renwick, architect of St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in midtown. In distinction to the French Gothic convention of St Patrick\u2019s, All Saints is Renwick\u2019s homage to the Italian Gothic, as popularized by John Ruskin.</p> <p>Were St Patrick\u2019s, or Temple Emmanuel, or the Metropolitan Opera, or the New York Public Library about to be stripped of all architectural and decorative elements of identity and distinction, would New Yorkers or elected officials sit by? Would they even fail to comment?</p> <p>Some might say that as a cultural landmark, All Saints hardly rises to the level of such places. That would be understandable. In America, virtually nothing black can hope to be as esteemed or revered as a comparable white institution or landmark. Class counts too. The mostly Irish immigrants who built All Saints are not likely to be accorded the same importance as the mostly well-to-do Irish who built St Patrick\u2019s.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Think of amazing restaurants and studios abroad made from disused churches, decorated by amazing windows and frescoes</p> <footer> <cite>Barry Bergdoll, Columbia University</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>All Saints is made from brick and terracotta, not Sing Sing marble.

As entire blocks are cleared for condominiums, displacement is just so much collateral damage. But there are black leaders assisting in this violation. In the fight for Harlem\u2019s heritage and soul, they are the enemy within. Nearly every two months, another church is lost. From 96th to 155th Streets, an estimated 350 properties are owned by churches. According to the Manhattan borough president, Gale Brewer, a study in progress considers these structures as the mayor might: as 5m sq ft of development rights, potentially translated into 5,600 two-bedroom apartments. In Harlem, some truths are universally acknowledged. Local politicians are manipulated from downtown; a deal has been made in the dark to sacrifice black Harlem, its legacy and people, to provide convenient housing for the better off. Everyone knows the gap between black wealth and white is at a ratio of 100:1. Everyone knows new residents are bound to be white. More obscure is how for each landmark recognized in Harlem there are five in Greenwich Village, where three-quarters of buildings are designated versus about 10% uptown. Attempts to excuse this disparity amount to victim blaming. Sure, Jane Jacobs took down Robert Moses\u2019 proposed superhighway that would have split the Village in two. But 30 years earlier, unsung Harlem preservationists led by Dr Louis T Wright and architect Vertner Woodson Tandy also wrangled with the all-powerful planning tsar \u2013 and won. \u201cWhen [Moses] focused on destroying Stanford White\u2019s brainchild, an elegant enclave of houses know as Strivers\u2019 Row, in 1935, to build a housing project, the black press and homeowners hollered like hell and were victorious,\u201d said Valerie Jo Bradley, president of Save Harlem Now! \u201cOur built environment, our history of striving for excellence, is every bit as good as anything in the Village. We are deserving of the same comprehensive preservation they have. Harlem is too important, so that\u2019s our goal.\u201d \u2018A bar and a church\u2019 Little more than a century ago, Harlem was transformed. Churches, synagogues, theaters and brownstones were repurposed and along with a few new structures and innumerable remodeled store fronts became black houses of worship. More than a place to meet God, they were places to meet each other, combinations of employment agency, settlement house, dating service, social club and credit union. It was said there was \u201ca bar and a church on every Harlem corner\u201d. They were the chief glory of the neighborhood, places for praising the almighty with awe-inspiring fashion, oratory and music. Expressive of abiding faith, Harlem churches proclaimed African American humanity. Today, there is not one that would not be more valuable as the base of a condo tower. \u201cIt seems as if everyone sees a big payday,\u201d said Brewer. \u201cThis condo takeover may seem attractive but we\u2019re working with residents to identify a better tactic that\u2019s more sustaining and sustainable \u2026 We are working to allow air rights to be transferred far more widely.\u201d Imee Jackson is a lifelong Harlemite who belongs to Grace Congregational church, which is soon to be razed. \u201cNo one is forcing us,\u201d she said. \u201cBlack parishioners, treating preachers like infallible ambassadors from Jesus, are just giving our churches away.\u201d The United Methodist church of New York has profited by destroying two churches. Two more await demolition. Carey King, a Harlem activist, said of the endangered Metropolitan Community church: \u201cThe new owner, Round Square Builders, paid the bishop $16m. They bought the lot where the church stands as well as the 45 East 126th Street brownstone and are planning an eight-story building with a parking garage underneath. They say they hope to make it as contextual as possible. Their architects are DXA Studio. \u201cThe church retains ownership of the parish house and empty lot next door. Demolition is to be complete by September \u2026 The fate of this Gothic revival relic by Rembrandt Lockwood, from 1872, is sealed.\u201d A loose coalition \u2013 with which I\u2019m associated \u2013 is trying to save Metropolitan Community. Two people in this group tried to get the Landmarks Preservation Commission to landmark the church as an anchor to a historic district, but without success. The congregation, for its part, will never see any of the money. [See footnote] Nearby, St Martin\u2019s is famous for its outstanding carillon, dedicated by both Queen Juliana of Holland and Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. Uniquely, with its merged sister congregation, St Lukes, the church owns its parish buildings. But now the Rt Rev Andrew ML Dietsche, episcopal bishop of New York, has taken charge. The city building department approved services in the parish hall while work ensues but church authorities decided to close St Martin\u2019s regardless. Recently, at a sidewalk service outside the shuttered church, erstwhile choirmaster and organist Malcolm Merriweather asked: \u201cWhy in Harlem is there no provision for landmarked not-for-profits to transfer air-rights profitably, anywhere across an entire neighborhood, as is possible in the new rezoning district called Midtown East? Such an option would make maintaining our historic church no longer automatically most easily achieved through destruction.\u201d All Saints, between 129th and 130th Streets on Madison Avenue, is the most architecturally significant church in Harlem. Deconsecrated and closed in preparation for sale, it is about to meet its fate. All Saints was completed early in the 1900s but it was designed more than 20 years earlier, the final church by James Renwick, architect of St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in midtown. In distinction to the French Gothic convention of St Patrick\u2019s, All Saints is Renwick\u2019s homage to the Italian Gothic, as popularized by John Ruskin. Were St Patrick\u2019s, or Temple Emmanuel, or the Metropolitan Opera, or the New York Public Library about to be stripped of all architectural and decorative elements of identity and distinction, would New Yorkers or elected officials sit by? Would they even fail to comment? Some might say that as a cultural landmark, All Saints hardly rises to the level of such places. That would be understandable. In America, virtually nothing black can hope to be as esteemed or revered as a comparable white institution or landmark. Class counts too. The mostly Irish immigrants who built All Saints are not likely to be accorded the same importance as the mostly well-to-do Irish who built St Patrick\u2019s. All Saints is made from brick and terracotta, not Sing Sing marble. It was built in a far shorter time. Nonetheless, the architectural critic Montgomery Schuyler deemed it aesthetically superior. Black, white, rich, poor, full, nearly empty: by almost every metric the two Renwick churches, uptown and downtown, represent a uniquely American dichotomy of disparity. But church and cathedral are equal. This ought not be overlooked as a consequence of arbitrary and racist devaluation. Barry Bergdoll, a historian who lives in Harlem and teaches at Columbia, made a plea for the beauty and value of All Saints to be maintained in whatever comes next: \u201cThink of all the amazing restaurants and design studios abroad made from disused churches, still decorated by amazing windows and frescoes filled with religious scenes and iconography.\u201d Ann-Isabel Friedman, who heads the New York Landmarks Conservancy Sacred Sites Program, said: \u201cA provision to protect exceptional interiors in historic houses of worship must be provided once they no longer have a religious function.\u201d David Levering Lewis of New York University, dean of African America scholars and the author of When Harlem Was in Vogue, said: \u201cIt\u2019s regrettable that the integrity of this landmark must give way in the maw of a real estate deal.\u201d \u2018Across 125th Street\u2019 In Harlem, many other enterprises seem hellbent on a kind of cultural suicide. \u201cWhether churches or venerable institutions, the record of collusion with gentrification is endless,\u201d said Dr Kay Samuels, a community activist. \u201cAt least two black-owned, Harlem-centered developers are responsible for destroying several historic properties. BRP Development demolished the Renaissance Ballroom, after Abyssinian Development promised the community to restore it. It was proposed as a rental building, but surprise, now it\u2019s condos. \u201cBOS Development purchased and destroyed the 1893 edifice of the Church of the Master. Again, for luxury condos. Child\u2019s Memorial Church of God in Christ, where Ossie Davis, officiating at Malcolm X\u2019s funeral, said: \u2018He was our black shining prince, who loved us so, he gave his life for us\u2019 \u2026 I was just shocked when that got torn down. The developer promised members there the moon but then got into a little \u2018spot\u2019, so it\u2019s only an empty lot now. \u201cHarlem Hospital, that\u2019s just as bad. We are talking about magnificent Georgian revival-style buildings, English bond brickwork and limestone with steel structures, from the early 1930s. And all the people in charge can think of is to raze them, claiming that keeping them, adapting them into affordable, much-needed hospital staff housing, would add $26m to whatever they did. Yeah, right!\u201d Even the Studio Museum In Harlem is in danger. A late 19th-century building by notable architects, remolded by acclaimed black designer J Max Bond, it is about to give way to British \u201cstarchitect\u201d David Adjaye\u2019s latest project. No one seems concerned that what will be lost formed the backdrop of Harlem\u2019s greatness, or that what will come is by design an alien intrusion, unrelated to surroundings or history. \u201cNor is anyone bothered that area architects of color, who seldom see so prestigious a commission, were yet again passed over for an outsider,\u201d said Alan Berman, a Harlem architect. \u201cThe same situation is at play across 125th Street.\u201d There, the National Urban League is erecting its new headquarters. Devised by white architects, this project for the nation\u2019s oldest civil rights group has displaced local businesses. Ironically, 50 years ago the league secured discounted commercial spots for locals when a new state office building went up. Speaking of irony, from 1920 to 1937 the best place blacks could stay in Harlem was not the elegant and luxurious Hotel Theresa, which opened in 1913. As at the best restaurants and nightclubs, black patrons were refused. So Alain Locke, Louis Armstrong, Satchel Page and Nancy Cunard, the English aristocrat who took a black lover, all stopped instead at the three-story Hotel Olga. Now, the Rev Al Sharpton seems \u2013 a request for comment was not returned \u2013 on the verge of agreeing to level this forlorn shrine and replace it with his civil rights museum, a laudable enterprise but one meant to sit within a 50-storey condo tower. Despite the urging of community board 10 and groups like Save Harlem Now!, the landmarks commission has taken no action. \u201cIt\u2019s not right,\u201d said Cordell Cleare, a district leader and city council contender. \u201cSome dismiss landmarks as a triviality. But whatever celebrates that black people built this country, despite being held back, that\u2019s fantastic!\u201d \u2022 Michael Henry Adams is an architectural-cultural historian and historic preservation activist who lives in, lectures on and conducts tours of Harlem. He is the author of Harlem, Lost and Found: An Architectural and Social history, 1765-1915 and the forthcoming Homo Harlem: and Gay Life in the African American Cultural Capital, 1915-1995 \u2022 This article was amended on 25 June 2019. The author\u2019s participation in local efforts to save Metropolitan Community church has been made clear, and a paragraph criticizing inaction by the Landmarks Preservation Commission over this church, corrected. The criticisms were mistakenly attributed to Carey King when they should have been (and now are) in the author\u2019s voice. Carey King notes she has had \u201cno dealings with the commission regarding the creation of a historic district\u201d linked to Metropolitan Community, and no internal knowledge of the church congregation\u2019s finances.",

Indeed, among many sections of the UK population, declines have set in. Hence the meeting, organised by the British Society for Population Studies, which has been organised so delegates can use data \u2013 to be released this week by the Office for National Statistics \u2013 to update their life expectancy projections.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a perfect storm,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/danny-dorling\" title=\"\">Danny Dorling</a>, professor of social geography at Oxford University, who has organised the London meeting. \u201cOur faltering life expectancy rates show we have now got the worst trend in health anywhere in western Europe since the second world war. To achieve that, we must have made a lot of bad decisions,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Statisticians first noticed in 2013 that rises in life expectancy in the UK had begun to slow down. Gradually, the graph \u2013 which been rising for decades \u2013 flattened out until, a few years ago, it started to decline for<strong> </strong>increasing numbers of people. The elderly, the poor and the newborn were worst affected. For example, life expectancies for those over 65 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/mar/07/life-expectancy-slumps-by-five-months\" title=\"\">have dropped by more than six months</a>.</p> <p>The trend now causes considerable concern among doctors who view life expectancy figures as barometers of the health of Britain. From this perspective, the nation is sickening \u2013 and a host of different factors have been put forward as explanations.</p> <p>One frequently made claim is that humans have simply reached the peak of longevity. \u201cLife expectancy cannot be expected to increase forever,\u201d Robert Courts, a Tory MP, told the Commons recently.</p> <p>Many statisticians point out, however, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/17/life-expectancy-rising-finland-uk-scandinavia\" title=\"\">life expectancy has continued to rise</a> \u2013 well above UK levels \u2013 in many other places, including Hong Kong, mainland China, Japan and Scandinavia. Other factors must be involved, they state.</p> <p>For its part, the Department of Health initially claimed that flu epidemics, triggered by harsh winters, were killing the weak and elderly, raising mortality rates and reducing life expectancies. But this idea is dismissed by Dr Lucinda Hiam, an honorary research fellow at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.</p> <p>\u201cI was working as a GP during this time and didn\u2019t notice a dramatic increase in flu among patients coming into my practice,\u201d she said. In fact, it has been shown that five of the seven winters between 2011 and 2017 had above-average temperatures, making them unlikely triggers of flu epidemics.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the Department of Health persisted with the idea for some time. \u201cWhen my colleagues and I first questioned the strength of impact that flu was having in increasing deaths, and suggested the role of the cuts should be explored, we were dismissed by health officials,\u201d Hiam said. \u201cBut since then the evidence of flu being solely responsible has largely evaporated.\u201d</p> <p>Instead, Dorling, Hiam and many other epidemiologists argue that life expectancy started to decline in Britain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/aug/19/bad-news-is-were-dying-earlier-in-britain-down-to-shit-life-syndrome\" title=\"\">as a direct result of the austerity measures imposed by the Tory-led government in 2010</a>. These cutbacks \u2013 which removed more than \u00a330bn from welfare payments, housing subsidies and social services over the past eight years \u2013 were some of the most severe made by any nation after the 2008 financial crisis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"041646433c3192b74382e46b092904e3100f7f02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/041646433c3192b74382e46b092904e3100f7f02/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Professor Danny Dorling\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Professor Danny Dorling: \u2018We have now got the worst trend in health anywhere in western Europe since World War Twothe second world war.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And once imposed, they triggered dramatic reductions in funding for social care, meals on wheels, rural bus services, NHS spending, numbers of health visitors and many other services. These in turn contributed to increased numbers of early deaths of vulnerable people, it is argued.</p> <p>\u201cLife expectancies started to stall just after the austerity cuts were introduced,\u201d said Hiam. \u201cThat alone does not prove the latter was the trigger for the former. However, no other plausible suggestion has since survived scrutiny, so it is hard not to conclude austerity cuts are involved.\u201d</p> <p>In the case of care for the elderly, the link looks especially persuasive. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/06/the-guardian-view-on-funding-social-care-break-the-tax-taboo\" title=\"\">Funding for social care for the elderly </a>had already been at breaking point for decades and recent austerity cuts only compounded the crisis,\u201d says Tom Gentry, senior health and care policy manager for Age UK.</p> <p>Previously the only individuals who had contact with many lonely, isolated old people were social and community care workers. Then came the cuts, which led to a dramatic reduction in this last line in defence of the elderly.</p> <p>\u201cToday, there is often no one who is talking to those elderly folk or spotting when they have stopped eating or noticed that are not moving around or are having balance problems. Then they fall over, lie there for days before being found and are then readmitted to hospital where they have to be given more serious interventions than would otherwise have been the case. Inevitably that will mean shortened lives.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this year, the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries said it now expects men aged 65 to die at 86.9 years, down from its previous estimate of 87.4 years, while women who reach 65 are likely to die at 89.2 years, down from 89.7 years. In other words, the life expectancy of people entering pension age has been cut by six months.</p> <p>This has implications not just for our health services but for our pensions industry. \u201cThe recent lowering of improvements in life expectancies has already had consequences,\u201d said Cobus Daneel, of the actuarial body, the Continuous Mortality Investigation. \u201cInsurance companies have been releasing money because it is realised they may not have to pay out as much to pay future pensions as previously expected. Of course, life expectancies still have room to get better in future\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Insurance companies have been releasing money because it is realised they may not have to pay out as much to pay future pensions.</p> <footer> <cite>Cobus Daneel, actuary</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the same time, the government has plans to put up the state pension age to 68 and has floated the idea of increasing it to 70. Now it may be forced to backtrack as increases in life expectances stall. \u201cThe increase to age 68 is only scheduled to come in between 2037 and 2039 and I would expect there will now have to be a further review before they are implemented,\u201d added Daneel.</p> <p>Last week the former health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, admitted that some cuts in social care funding imposed by the Conservative government \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/20/hunt-and-johnson-the-policies-personal-style-and-their-pasts\" title=\"\">did go too far</a>\u201d. However, the Department of Health continues to reject any link between those cuts and drops in life expectancies. \u201cWe are taking action to help people live longer and healthier lives,\u201d said a spokesman. \u201cCancer survival is at a record high, while smoking rates and teenage pregnancies are at an all-time low.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, the connection between austerity and dwindling life expectancy is hard to shake off, says David Walsh, of the Glasgow Centre for Population Health. The city once had some of the worst life expectancy rates in the western world \u2013 for example in the central area of Calton, a place blighted by poor housing, illness, high smoking rates, and violence.</p> <p>Inhabitants suffered high death rates linked to drug and alcohol abuse and suicides. As a result, at the beginning of the 21st century, the male life expectancy in Calton at birth was 54, one of the worst figures in the UK. Glasgow subsequently made major efforts to improve death rates in Calton but is now watching life expectancies slide back towards their old levels.</p> <p>\u201cI think it is pretty clear that austerity is to blame,\u201d says Walsh. \u201cWe have taken away these people\u2019s safety nets.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2019-06-22T13:41:12/embed.html\" data-alt=\".\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2019-06-22T13:41:12/embed.html\">.</a> </figure>  <p>The grim future facing these young adults was summed up by Sir Michael Marmot, professor of epidemiology at University College London. \u201cIf you were to go to a young man growing up in Calton who is doing drugs and alcohol and smoking and is unemployed and is unemployable and say to him: \u2018Look, you really shouldn\u2019t smoke.\u2019 Well, you wouldn\u2019t get far with him and, in any case, he might be quite rational for not making long-term plans because he does not have a long-term future.\u201d</p> <p>On top of the health impacts on the elderly and the deprived, there has also been a worrying change in infant mortality rates \u2013 as was acknowledged last week by the Office for National Statistics.

      "bodyText": "In a few days, a team of researchers, statisticians and geographers will gather at University College London to tackle an issue of increasing concern for doctors and health experts. They will investigate why many UK citizens are now living shorter, less healthy lives compared with the recent past. The emergence of faltering life expectancy in Britain has caused particular alarm because it reverses a trend that has continued, almost unbroken, for close to 100 years. Over this period, lives have lengthened continuously, blessing more and more British people with the gift of old age. But now that increase has come to a halt, statisticians have discovered. Indeed, among many sections of the UK population, declines have set in. Hence the meeting, organised by the British Society for Population Studies, which has been organised so delegates can use data \u2013 to be released this week by the Office for National Statistics \u2013 to update their life expectancy projections. \u201cIt is a perfect storm,\u201d says Danny Dorling, professor of social geography at Oxford University, who has organised the London meeting. \u201cOur faltering life expectancy rates show we have now got the worst trend in health anywhere in western Europe since the second world war. To achieve that, we must have made a lot of bad decisions,\u201d he said. Statisticians first noticed in 2013 that rises in life expectancy in the UK had begun to slow down. Gradually, the graph \u2013 which been rising for decades \u2013 flattened out until, a few years ago, it started to decline for increasing numbers of people. The elderly, the poor and the newborn were worst affected. For example, life expectancies for those over 65 have dropped by more than six months. The trend now causes considerable concern among doctors who view life expectancy figures as barometers of the health of Britain. From this perspective, the nation is sickening \u2013 and a host of different factors have been put forward as explanations. One frequently made claim is that humans have simply reached the peak of longevity. \u201cLife expectancy cannot be expected to increase forever,\u201d Robert Courts, a Tory MP, told the Commons recently. Many statisticians point out, however, that life expectancy has continued to rise \u2013 well above UK levels \u2013 in many other places, including Hong Kong, mainland China, Japan and Scandinavia. Other factors must be involved, they state. For its part, the Department of Health initially claimed that flu epidemics, triggered by harsh winters, were killing the weak and elderly, raising mortality rates and reducing life expectancies. But this idea is dismissed by Dr Lucinda Hiam, an honorary research fellow at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \u201cI was working as a GP during this time and didn\u2019t notice a dramatic increase in flu among patients coming into my practice,\u201d she said. In fact, it has been shown that five of the seven winters between 2011 and 2017 had above-average temperatures, making them unlikely triggers of flu epidemics. Nevertheless, the Department of Health persisted with the idea for some time. \u201cWhen my colleagues and I first questioned the strength of impact that flu was having in increasing deaths, and suggested the role of the cuts should be explored, we were dismissed by health officials,\u201d Hiam said. \u201cBut since then the evidence of flu being solely responsible has largely evaporated.\u201d Instead, Dorling, Hiam and many other epidemiologists argue that life expectancy started to decline in Britain as a direct result of the austerity measures imposed by the Tory-led government in 2010. These cutbacks \u2013 which removed more than \u00a330bn from welfare payments, housing subsidies and social services over the past eight years \u2013 were some of the most severe made by any nation after the 2008 financial crisis. And once imposed, they triggered dramatic reductions in funding for social care, meals on wheels, rural bus services, NHS spending, numbers of health visitors and many other services. These in turn contributed to increased numbers of early deaths of vulnerable people, it is argued. \u201cLife expectancies started to stall just after the austerity cuts were introduced,\u201d said Hiam. \u201cThat alone does not prove the latter was the trigger for the former. However, no other plausible suggestion has since survived scrutiny, so it is hard not to conclude austerity cuts are involved.\u201d In the case of care for the elderly, the link looks especially persuasive. \u201cFunding for social care for the elderly had already been at breaking point for decades and recent austerity cuts only compounded the crisis,\u201d says Tom Gentry, senior health and care policy manager for Age UK. Previously the only individuals who had contact with many lonely, isolated old people were social and community care workers. Then came the cuts, which led to a dramatic reduction in this last line in defence of the elderly. \u201cToday, there is often no one who is talking to those elderly folk or spotting when they have stopped eating or noticed that are not moving around or are having balance problems. Then they fall over, lie there for days before being found and are then readmitted to hospital where they have to be given more serious interventions than would otherwise have been the case. Inevitably that will mean shortened lives.\u201d Earlier this year, the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries said it now expects men aged 65 to die at 86.9 years, down from its previous estimate of 87.4 years, while women who reach 65 are likely to die at 89.2 years, down from 89.7 years. In other words, the life expectancy of people entering pension age has been cut by six months. This has implications not just for our health services but for our pensions industry. \u201cThe recent lowering of improvements in life expectancies has already had consequences,\u201d said Cobus Daneel, of the actuarial body, the Continuous Mortality Investigation. \u201cInsurance companies have been releasing money because it is realised they may not have to pay out as much to pay future pensions as previously expected. Of course, life expectancies still have room to get better in future\u201d At the same time, the government has plans to put up the state pension age to 68 and has floated the idea of increasing it to 70. Now it may be forced to backtrack as increases in life expectances stall. \u201cThe increase to age 68 is only scheduled to come in between 2037 and 2039 and I would expect there will now have to be a further review before they are implemented,\u201d added Daneel. Last week the former health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, admitted that some cuts in social care funding imposed by the Conservative government \u201cdid go too far\u201d. However, the Department of Health continues to reject any link between those cuts and drops in life expectancies. \u201cWe are taking action to help people live longer and healthier lives,\u201d said a spokesman. \u201cCancer survival is at a record high, while smoking rates and teenage pregnancies are at an all-time low.\u201d Nevertheless, the connection between austerity and dwindling life expectancy is hard to shake off, says David Walsh, of the Glasgow Centre for Population Health. The city once had some of the worst life expectancy rates in the western world \u2013 for example in the central area of Calton, a place blighted by poor housing, illness, high smoking rates, and violence. Inhabitants suffered high death rates linked to drug and alcohol abuse and suicides. As a result, at the beginning of the 21st century, the male life expectancy in Calton at birth was 54, one of the worst figures in the UK. Glasgow subsequently made major efforts to improve death rates in Calton but is now watching life expectancies slide back towards their old levels. \u201cI think it is pretty clear that austerity is to blame,\u201d says Walsh. \u201cWe have taken away these people\u2019s safety nets.\u201d The grim future facing these young adults was summed up by Sir Michael Marmot, professor of epidemiology at University College London. \u201cIf you were to go to a young man growing up in Calton who is doing drugs and alcohol and smoking and is unemployed and is unemployable and say to him: \u2018Look, you really shouldn\u2019t smoke.\u2019 Well, you wouldn\u2019t get far with him and, in any case, he might be quite rational for not making long-term plans because he does not have a long-term future.\u201d On top of the health impacts on the elderly and the deprived, there has also been a worrying change in infant mortality rates \u2013 as was acknowledged last week by the Office for National Statistics. It reported that in 2017, there were 3.9 deaths per 1,000 live births in the UK. In 2016, there were 3.8. \u201cInfant mortality had been reducing since the 1980s and reached an all-time low in 2014. But since then the rate has increased every year,\u201d said Vasita Patel, a senior research officer at the ONS. \u201cThe one in 2017 is significantly higher than the one in 2014.\u201d To explain this alarming increase in infant mortality, Dorling blames a host of factors: \u201cFewer midwives, an overstrained ambulance service, general deterioration of hospitals, greater poverty among pregnant women and cuts that mean there are fewer health visitors for patients in need \u2013 all these factors are involved.\u201d The crucial point is that health statistics tells us something fundamental about how well a society is doing, says Marmot. \u201cWhen you see significant differences in life expectancy rates, that is telling us something particularly important about how well society is distributing its benefits.\u201d According to Marmot, a former president of the World Medical Association, a person with a university degree in Britain has a longer life expectancy than a school leaver with A-levels who in turn will do better than someone who did not sit A-levels. \u201cThe higher your income the longer you live,\u201d he states. \u201cSimilarly, the higher the status of your occupation, the longer your life expectancy.\u201d Equally, the lower the step on the socio-economic ladder that a person stands on, the more dependent they are likely to be on help or support from local authorities.

We should be investing significantly in health and social care like the rest of Europe. Its social policies are better for health and long life than American social policies.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In his 32 years of farming, Steve Fourez says he\u2019s almost never been so late planting corn and soybean crops on the 500 acres he farms in east-central Illinois.</p> <p>Normally by the start of May he\u2019s finished planting corn, and soybeans are seeded soon after. This year, Fourez said, he wrapped up planting on 6 June, as cold, grey and rainy weather kept him idle. Fourez\u2019s experience is playing out across the corn belt, a deeply fertile agricultural region stretching roughly from Ohio to Nebraska.</p> <p>Planting is so tardy that the US Department of Agriculture\u2019s June 28 acreage report, an annual survey of what crops farmers planted this year, will take on heightened importance.</p> <p>Mike Zuzolo, the president of Global Commodity Analytics and Consulting, said: \u201cThis planting-delay issue, because of what states it has affected, will make the planted acreage report \u2026 historically important for market direction.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/07/indiana-farmers-storms-trump-tariffs\">Storm-battered Indiana farmers fear new Trump tariff tempest</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mike Tannura, the founder of T-Storm Weather, a weather forecasting service that focuses on agriculture, said the timeframe between June last year and June this year represents the wettest in the corn belt in 125 years, as the jet stream has largely stayed put, affecting precipitation patterns. \u201cWe\u2019re crushing all kinds of rainfall records,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Farmers\u2019 planting woes pushed corn prices at the Chicago board of trade to five-year highs, with the December contract \u2013 which reflects this year\u2019s planted acreage \u2013 trading around $4.50 a bushel. Market-watchers say grain markets are setting up for a volatile summer for prices.</p> <p>The late start to the season adds insult to injury for farmers, who have wrestled with several years of low prices because of bumper harvests and slowing demand because of the US-China trade war.</p> <p>The agriculture department is already trimming its acreage and production estimates for this fall\u2019s corn harvest. In mid-June it knocked off 3m acres from its initial 2019 planting forecast of 92.8m acres, bringing it to 89.8m; and cut the national yield estimate by 10 bushels per acre to 166 bushels per acre, which Zuzolo said is unprecedented.</p> <p>Estimates for additional cuts range from another 2m to 3m acres. This year\u2019s total drop will probably exceed the previous prevented-planted acreage record of 3.6m set in 2013.</p> <p>For the acreage report, USDA surveys farmers in the first two weeks of June about how much they actually planted, and the most recent weekly crop progress report as of 17 June showed 96% of the corn crop in the ground nationally. Usually it\u2019s 100% by now.</p> <p>Ken Morrison, the editor of market newsletter <a href=\"https://www.morrisononthemarkets.com/\">Morrison on the Markets</a>, said he thinks traders are overestimating how much USDA will cut in the acreage report, since farmers had incentives to plant until mid-June to collect crop insurance payments.</p> <p>There\u2019s some speculation the significant delays may make the 27 June data less accurate. Morrison suggested USDA may re-survey farmers at the end of July and give an updated figure in the monthly August crop production report, noting there is some precedent to this.</p> <p>What makes this year so serious is where the farmers are having trouble. Illinois is the second largest corn-growing state, and farmers there were only 88% done as of 17 June, when normally more than half complete planting in the first week of May. Shawn Hackett, the president of agricultural consulting firm Hackett Financial Advisors, said to see Illinois farmers this far behind is shocking.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1fca9bc3779c8f2bef9f23c6dc407a3f88e092af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1fca9bc3779c8f2bef9f23c6dc407a3f88e092af/0_56_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The scene in Sheffield, Illinois.

You just can\u2019t have Illinois miss production. It\u2019s some of the best ground in the country,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Krista Swanson, a west-central Illinois farmer, had to reseed some land and still left about 40 acres unplanted. She said the late planting means a host of problems for growing crops: pollination in hot weather reduces yield, abundant topsoil moisture creates a shallow root structure which leaves crops at risk of dry weather or toppling over, and plants mature late.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really a domino effect,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Harvest will be delayed until mid-October, causing farmers to race against time to avoid frost killing the crop. Tannura said even normal frost dates could be a problem, let alone an early frost.</p> <p>While corn prices are at five-year highs, farmers may not really benefit. It\u2019s too early to estimate production, so they can\u2019t make forward sales to take advantage of current values, Zuzolo and Hackett said. A poor macroeconomic environment also bites, as trade wars soften demand, the global economy is slowing, the US dollar is stronger and there\u2019s ample feed-wheat supplies available to livestock producers. Even though corn supplies could tighten significantly, Hackett doesn\u2019t expect a repeat of 2012 when the corn futures prices hit $8 a bushel in a similar supply scenario.</p> <p>\u201cIn this environment, it\u2019s not $8.

      "bodyText": "In his 32 years of farming, Steve Fourez says he\u2019s almost never been so late planting corn and soybean crops on the 500 acres he farms in east-central Illinois. Normally by the start of May he\u2019s finished planting corn, and soybeans are seeded soon after. This year, Fourez said, he wrapped up planting on 6 June, as cold, grey and rainy weather kept him idle. Fourez\u2019s experience is playing out across the corn belt, a deeply fertile agricultural region stretching roughly from Ohio to Nebraska. Planting is so tardy that the US Department of Agriculture\u2019s June 28 acreage report, an annual survey of what crops farmers planted this year, will take on heightened importance. Mike Zuzolo, the president of Global Commodity Analytics and Consulting, said: \u201cThis planting-delay issue, because of what states it has affected, will make the planted acreage report \u2026 historically important for market direction.\u201d Mike Tannura, the founder of T-Storm Weather, a weather forecasting service that focuses on agriculture, said the timeframe between June last year and June this year represents the wettest in the corn belt in 125 years, as the jet stream has largely stayed put, affecting precipitation patterns. \u201cWe\u2019re crushing all kinds of rainfall records,\u201d he said. Farmers\u2019 planting woes pushed corn prices at the Chicago board of trade to five-year highs, with the December contract \u2013 which reflects this year\u2019s planted acreage \u2013 trading around $4.50 a bushel. Market-watchers say grain markets are setting up for a volatile summer for prices. The late start to the season adds insult to injury for farmers, who have wrestled with several years of low prices because of bumper harvests and slowing demand because of the US-China trade war. The agriculture department is already trimming its acreage and production estimates for this fall\u2019s corn harvest. In mid-June it knocked off 3m acres from its initial 2019 planting forecast of 92.8m acres, bringing it to 89.8m; and cut the national yield estimate by 10 bushels per acre to 166 bushels per acre, which Zuzolo said is unprecedented. Estimates for additional cuts range from another 2m to 3m acres. This year\u2019s total drop will probably exceed the previous prevented-planted acreage record of 3.6m set in 2013. For the acreage report, USDA surveys farmers in the first two weeks of June about how much they actually planted, and the most recent weekly crop progress report as of 17 June showed 96% of the corn crop in the ground nationally. Usually it\u2019s 100% by now. Ken Morrison, the editor of market newsletter Morrison on the Markets, said he thinks traders are overestimating how much USDA will cut in the acreage report, since farmers had incentives to plant until mid-June to collect crop insurance payments. There\u2019s some speculation the significant delays may make the 27 June data less accurate. Morrison suggested USDA may re-survey farmers at the end of July and give an updated figure in the monthly August crop production report, noting there is some precedent to this. What makes this year so serious is where the farmers are having trouble. Illinois is the second largest corn-growing state, and farmers there were only 88% done as of 17 June, when normally more than half complete planting in the first week of May. Shawn Hackett, the president of agricultural consulting firm Hackett Financial Advisors, said to see Illinois farmers this far behind is shocking. \u201cYou look at the state and you go, \u2018holy mackerel\u2019. You just can\u2019t have Illinois miss production. It\u2019s some of the best ground in the country,\u201d he said. Krista Swanson, a west-central Illinois farmer, had to reseed some land and still left about 40 acres unplanted. She said the late planting means a host of problems for growing crops: pollination in hot weather reduces yield, abundant topsoil moisture creates a shallow root structure which leaves crops at risk of dry weather or toppling over, and plants mature late. \u201cIt\u2019s really a domino effect,\u201d she said. Harvest will be delayed until mid-October, causing farmers to race against time to avoid frost killing the crop. Tannura said even normal frost dates could be a problem, let alone an early frost. While corn prices are at five-year highs, farmers may not really benefit. It\u2019s too early to estimate production, so they can\u2019t make forward sales to take advantage of current values, Zuzolo and Hackett said. A poor macroeconomic environment also bites, as trade wars soften demand, the global economy is slowing, the US dollar is stronger and there\u2019s ample feed-wheat supplies available to livestock producers. Even though corn supplies could tighten significantly, Hackett doesn\u2019t expect a repeat of 2012 when the corn futures prices hit $8 a bushel in a similar supply scenario. \u201cIn this environment, it\u2019s not $8. I\u2019m just speculating, but maybe $6 gets the job done right now,\u201d he said.",

My eardrums will never been the same. Keep America great.\u201d</p> <p>This week it will be the Democrats\u2019 turn to search for a magic sentence. Twenty candidates, each vying to make Trump the first one-term president since George HW Bush, will line up over two nights for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/14/democratic-candidates-debate-sanders-harris-and-biden-will-spar-in-two-night-event\">the party\u2019s first primary debates </a>in Miami. All will be keen to avoid a campaign-ending gaffe; all will be keen to deliver a \u201czinger\u201d that goes viral and can rival the potency of \u201cMake America great again\u201d.</p> <p>Among the oldest candidates in the field is Joe Biden, 76, whose pitch has been described by sceptics as \u201cMake America 2016 again\u201d \u2013 a restoration of the Obama presidency, when Biden served as deputy. But the youngest contender, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/22/south-bend-mayor-presidential-candidate-2020\">Pete Buttigieg,</a> the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has stressed the need to look forwardly, saying pointedly: \u201cThere is no such thing as an honest politics that revolves around the word \u2018again\u2019.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>With \u2018Keep America great\u2019 the important point is silent: it means keep America great for straight white men</p> <footer> <cite>Neil Sroka</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Neil Sroka, a spokesperson for the progressive group Democracy for America, said: \u201c\u2018Make America great again\u2019 was clear and very much in line with the bigotry that underlay both the Trump campaign and administration. The slogan did something Trump is unable to to do: keep the loud part quiet and keep the quiet part loud. With \u2018Keep America great\u2019 the important point is silent: it means keep America great for straight white men.</p> <p>\u201cThe key for Democrats is to articulate a bold, inclusive people\u2019s vision of the country that is easy for people to understand and is as effective as \u2018Make America great again\u2019 in that is says something quietly \u2013 that is, it\u2019s for all of us. We\u2019re going to need everyone to beat the kind of hate-filled campaign Trump is going to run.\u201d</p> <p>The first Democrat to enter the race was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/13/john-delaney-don-quixote-american-dream-president-2020\">former congressman John Delaney</a>, nearly two years ago. Other candidates have been campaigning and fundraising for months. But for millions of Americans, this week\u2019s debates will fire the starting gun in earnest.

Is Trump such a uniquely awful singularity that the party should play safe and stay in the centre? Can they contemplate nominating yet another ageing white male? Is this election about turning out the base or reaching out to independents and disaffected Republicans? Or has Trump changed everything?</p> <p>The candidates\u2019 podium positions will reflect their standings in polls as of 12 June. Elizabeth Warren and former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas will be centre stage on the first night, giving Warren, who has been surging, a real chance to shine. On night two, Biden and Bernie Sanders will be in the middle, flanked by rivals including Buttigieg and Kamala Harris.</p> <p>It will be a particular test for Biden, whose runs for president in 1988 and 2008 crashed and burned and who has been described as a \u201cgaffe machine\u201d.

But like in any tennis match, one unforced error, even two unforced errors, would not necessarily lose the match<em>. </em>Biden was just talking about his ability to go outside of his comfort zone and maybe get a little bit too comfortable saying that.\u201d</p> <p>Clyburn has been <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/rep-james-e-clyburn-under-the-spotlight-after-a-week-fraught-with-controversy/2019/06/20/845e4c72-91ff-11e9-aadb-74e6b2b46f6a_story.html?utm_term=.a25d613f62b3\">described as the \u201ckingmaker\u201d</a> in South Carolina, the first southern state to vote. \u201cJust from the reports I\u2019m getting, people are telling me that Biden is performing exceptionally well,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has a tremendous reservoir of goodwill here in the state.\u201d But Biden has to be \u201cat the top of his game\u201d in the debates, he added.</p> <p>Indeed, Biden will be the primary target for his fellow debaters. <a href=\"https://eppc.org/author/henry_olsen/\">Henry Olsen,</a> a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center thinktank in Washington, said: \u201cHe\u2019s a 76-year-old taking incoming from his left, right and centre for two hours under hot television lights. He\u2019s not had that for 20 years. All it takes is one tired moment at 10.35pm and that\u2019s the story. There\u2019a s high possibility of it happening.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/democratic-candidates-poll-the-win-calculus-shapes-democratic-2020-field/\">A recent CBS News poll</a> found that the ability to beat Trump is the most important consideration for Democratic voters (78%), ahead of new policy ideas (40%) and changing Washington (31%). During the debates, Trump will loom large.</p> <p>Olsen said: \u201cThe ideal Democrat will have the personality where Trump\u2019s attacks would seem crazy or just bounce off. Biden\u2019s isn\u2019t that. Amy Klobuchar would be that sort of person. Cory Booker could be.</p> <p>\u201cThe Democratic base can only get you so far. To win, you have to do well among disaffected suburban Republicans and blue-collar former Democrats. Ideally, you would not want a strongly progressive platform because that gives Trump something to run against. You want something like the 2018 midterms campaign: House Democrats ran on bland, vanilla issues and won. But I don\u2019t know if the progressive wing is willing to let them do that.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018None of them has the star power of Trump\u2019</h2> <p>Ever since John F Kennedy outshone a clammy and unshaven Richard Nixon, whose pale suit fared poorly on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/26/presidential-debates-nixon-kennedy-1960\">black and white television in 1960,</a> election campaign debates have also been about charisma and dominating the small screen \u2013 a place where Trump feels at home.</p> <p><a href=\"https://deanofstudents.umich.edu/profile/aaron-kall\">Aaron Kall,</a> director of debate at the University of Michigan, said: \u201cViewers do think about that: who could hold their own on a debate stage with President Trump? Biden, given his stature, gravitas and experience as vice-president, would be able to hold it, but he definitely doesn\u2019t have the star quality. If there\u2019s anyone with that \u2018it factor\u2019 quality, I would say it\u2019s Buttigieg.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump's not all that comfortable with good news.

Democrats will also struggle to match the sheer razzamatazz of a Trump rally, a now familiar blend of rock concert, sports fixture, political pantomime and, in the view of critics, a bath in in rancid nostalgia.</p> <p>Just as the \u201cMake America great again\u201d slogan is widely seen as harking back to the 1950s \u2013 a nation of idyllic suburbia for white people and Jim Crow laws for African Americans \u2013 so the soundtrack of Trump rallies is full of booming golden oldies with resonant lines. On Tuesday there was the Rolling Stones , Luciano Pavarotti (Nessun dorma, or \u201cNone shall sleep\u201d), Frank Sinatra (My Way), the musical Cats (Memory) and Queen, whose song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04854XqcfCY\">We are the Champions</a> contains the Trumpian lyric: \u201cNo time for losers.\u201d</p> <p>Equally fitting, the rally was held in a sports stadium and served up a matchday blend of fun, menace and tribalism: fans wearing team colours, performing the Mexican wave, cheering their team and booing the opposition.

Should the insurgent turned incumbent stick with \u201cMake America great again\u201d (Maga), which he characterised as \u201cprobably and possibly the greatest theme in the history of politics\u201d? Or should he switch to \u201cKeep America great\u201d? It was the latter that that turned the stadium into a cauldron of noise. \u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry, Maga Country, but that wasn\u2019t too close,\u201d the president said on Tuesday night. \u201cI thought you had it won, and then I heard this cheer. My eardrums will never been the same. Keep America great.\u201d This week it will be the Democrats\u2019 turn to search for a magic sentence. Twenty candidates, each vying to make Trump the first one-term president since George HW Bush, will line up over two nights for the party\u2019s first primary debates in Miami. All will be keen to avoid a campaign-ending gaffe; all will be keen to deliver a \u201czinger\u201d that goes viral and can rival the potency of \u201cMake America great again\u201d. Among the oldest candidates in the field is Joe Biden, 76, whose pitch has been described by sceptics as \u201cMake America 2016 again\u201d \u2013 a restoration of the Obama presidency, when Biden served as deputy. But the youngest contender, Pete Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has stressed the need to look forwardly, saying pointedly: \u201cThere is no such thing as an honest politics that revolves around the word \u2018again\u2019.\u201d Neil Sroka, a spokesperson for the progressive group Democracy for America, said: \u201c\u2018Make America great again\u2019 was clear and very much in line with the bigotry that underlay both the Trump campaign and administration. The slogan did something Trump is unable to to do: keep the loud part quiet and keep the quiet part loud. With \u2018Keep America great\u2019 the important point is silent: it means keep America great for straight white men. \u201cThe key for Democrats is to articulate a bold, inclusive people\u2019s vision of the country that is easy for people to understand and is as effective as \u2018Make America great again\u2019 in that is says something quietly \u2013 that is, it\u2019s for all of us. We\u2019re going to need everyone to beat the kind of hate-filled campaign Trump is going to run.\u201d The first Democrat to enter the race was former congressman John Delaney, nearly two years ago. Other candidates have been campaigning and fundraising for months. But for millions of Americans, this week\u2019s debates will fire the starting gun in earnest. The line-up is historically diverse, including six women, six people of colour and a gay man. Democratic voters are wrestling with myriad push and pull factors. Is Trump such a uniquely awful singularity that the party should play safe and stay in the centre? Can they contemplate nominating yet another ageing white male? Is this election about turning out the base or reaching out to independents and disaffected Republicans? Or has Trump changed everything? The candidates\u2019 podium positions will reflect their standings in polls as of 12 June. Elizabeth Warren and former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas will be centre stage on the first night, giving Warren, who has been surging, a real chance to shine. On night two, Biden and Bernie Sanders will be in the middle, flanked by rivals including Buttigieg and Kamala Harris. It will be a particular test for Biden, whose runs for president in 1988 and 2008 crashed and burned and who has been described as a \u201cgaffe machine\u201d. Last week, for example, he recalled the \u201ccivility\u201d of racial segregationists he worked with in the Senate. \u201cHe never called me \u2018boy,\u2019 he always called me \u2018son\u2019,\u201d he said of one of them, citing a racist term and earning a sharp rebuke from other candidates. James Clyburn, who is African American and the majority whip in the House of Representatives, said on Friday: \u201cIt was an unforced error that hopefully he won\u2019t make too many of. But like in any tennis match, one unforced error, even two unforced errors, would not necessarily lose the match. Biden was just talking about his ability to go outside of his comfort zone and maybe get a little bit too comfortable saying that.\u201d Clyburn has been described as the \u201ckingmaker\u201d in South Carolina, the first southern state to vote. \u201cJust from the reports I\u2019m getting, people are telling me that Biden is performing exceptionally well,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has a tremendous reservoir of goodwill here in the state.\u201d But Biden has to be \u201cat the top of his game\u201d in the debates, he added. Indeed, Biden will be the primary target for his fellow debaters. Henry Olsen, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center thinktank in Washington, said: \u201cHe\u2019s a 76-year-old taking incoming from his left, right and centre for two hours under hot television lights. He\u2019s not had that for 20 years. All it takes is one tired moment at 10.35pm and that\u2019s the story. There\u2019a s high possibility of it happening.\u201d A recent CBS News poll found that the ability to beat Trump is the most important consideration for Democratic voters (78%), ahead of new policy ideas (40%) and changing Washington (31%). During the debates, Trump will loom large. Olsen said: \u201cThe ideal Democrat will have the personality where Trump\u2019s attacks would seem crazy or just bounce off. Biden\u2019s isn\u2019t that. Amy Klobuchar would be that sort of person. Cory Booker could be. \u201cThe Democratic base can only get you so far. To win, you have to do well among disaffected suburban Republicans and blue-collar former Democrats. Ideally, you would not want a strongly progressive platform because that gives Trump something to run against. You want something like the 2018 midterms campaign: House Democrats ran on bland, vanilla issues and won. But I don\u2019t know if the progressive wing is willing to let them do that.\u201d \u2018None of them has the star power of Trump\u2019 Ever since John F Kennedy outshone a clammy and unshaven Richard Nixon, whose pale suit fared poorly on black and white television in 1960, election campaign debates have also been about charisma and dominating the small screen \u2013 a place where Trump feels at home. Aaron Kall, director of debate at the University of Michigan, said: \u201cViewers do think about that: who could hold their own on a debate stage with President Trump? Biden, given his stature, gravitas and experience as vice-president, would be able to hold it, but he definitely doesn\u2019t have the star quality. If there\u2019s anyone with that \u2018it factor\u2019 quality, I would say it\u2019s Buttigieg.\u201d But he added: \u201cNone of them has the star power of Trump or is going to get 20,000 people at a rally.\u201d That is what the president pulled off last week in Orlando, Florida. Democrats will also struggle to match the sheer razzamatazz of a Trump rally, a now familiar blend of rock concert, sports fixture, political pantomime and, in the view of critics, a bath in in rancid nostalgia. Just as the \u201cMake America great again\u201d slogan is widely seen as harking back to the 1950s \u2013 a nation of idyllic suburbia for white people and Jim Crow laws for African Americans \u2013 so the soundtrack of Trump rallies is full of booming golden oldies with resonant lines. On Tuesday there was the Rolling Stones , Luciano Pavarotti (Nessun dorma, or \u201cNone shall sleep\u201d), Frank Sinatra (My Way), the musical Cats (Memory) and Queen, whose song We are the Champions contains the Trumpian lyric: \u201cNo time for losers.\u201d Equally fitting, the rally was held in a sports stadium and served up a matchday blend of fun, menace and tribalism: fans wearing team colours, performing the Mexican wave, cheering their team and booing the opposition. When the crowd hollered \u201cLock her up!\u201d about Hillary Clinton, Trump\u2019s 2016 opponent, it was like the muscle memory of football fans chanting about a long retired player. \u201cBuild that wall!\u201d is an evergreen favourite too. And Trump himself peddled nostalgia, not only for an America that never was, but for the alleged glories of 2016. His rambling speech of nearly an hour and half recycled the same old populist themes, tropes and falsehoods, from Clinton-bashing to fearmongering about immigration, and offered few policy proposals. When Trump stayed on script and touted his accomplishments (economic growth, low unemployment, conservative judges), he seemed a little flat and the crowd felt it, but when he aired grievances (\u201cWe went through the biggest witch hunt in political history\u201d) and went on the attack against the media (\u201cThat is a lot of fake news back there\u201d), he became fired up, an ageing rocker playing his greatest hits. Democrats are \u201ca radical leftwing mob\u201d, Trump said. \u201cA vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism, and the destruction of the American dream \u2026 This election is not merely a verdict on the amazing progress we\u2019ve made. It\u2019s a verdict on the un-American conduct of those who try to undermine our great democracy and undermine you.\u201d His base, which was overwhelmingly white, lapped it up as they wore T-shirts that included the legends \u201cMake liberals cry again\u201d and \u201cFuck your feelings\u201d. Bill Galston, a former adviser to President Bill Clinton, said: \u201cTrump\u2019s not all that comfortable with good news. He is much happier on the attack with a clearly identified foe at the tip of his spear. That is his default mode. He defines himself against adversaries and gets strength from an oppositional stance. The core of his support are for him because he shares their antipathies. He\u2019s the only leader in their lifetime who has given full, unabashed voice to those antipathies.\u201d Asked how a Democrat can combat the upcoming tidal wave of hate and mendacity, Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, said: \u201cMr Trump\u2019s principal weakness is himself. The issue in 2020 is going to be at least as much his character and conduct as president as it will be about substantive differences.\u201d Democrats\u2019 central theme, he suggested, could be an echo of George W Bush\u2019s pledge to \u201crestore honor and dignity\u201d after the scandals of the Clinton years. Nasty, brutish and long There is no doubt Trump faces an uphill struggle. He is the only president in the history of Gallup polling never to crack 50% approval. Yet he made fools of the pundits and pollsters last time, in the electoral college at least, and last week\u2019s rally was a formidable show of strength from his base. Trump raised $24.8m in less than 24 hours \u2013 far more than any Democrat. Tom Tancredo, a former Republican congressman from Colorado, predicted: \u201cI believe he will win and he will win fairly handily. Part of the Democratic base can only be satisfied by the most radical brand. They\u2019re all leftwing loonies but some are more loony than others. Biden is probably the least loony but, because of that, I think he\u2019ll have almost no chance of making it.\u201d The Orlando rally made clear that Trump will redouble his efforts to mobilise core support and make little effort to claim to govern for all Americans. All the signs point to 2020 being a repeat of 2016 but even more nasty, brutish and long, less \u201cKeep America great\u201d than \u201cHello darkness, my old friend\u201d. Democrats are anxious to go high and find a candidate who, like Bill Clinton or Obama, whips up huge enthusiasm. The debates will offer a glimpse of alternative futures. Sroka said: \u201cYou\u2019ll see people ask not just for an alternative to Trump but what kind of country do we want to live in after Trump? Do we want to live in a country that retains the policies that contributed to the rise of Trump or one that deals with the preconditions that allowed it to happen?\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Xi Jinping might possibly agree next weekend on further steps to bring down China\u2019s trade imbalance with the US, giving Donald Trump a face-saving way of ending his trade war. But Xi won\u2019t agree to change China\u2019s economic system. Why should he? The American economic system is focused on maximizing shareholder returns. And it\u2019s achieving that goal: on Friday, the S&amp;P 500 notched a new all-time high. But average Americans have seen no significant gains in their incomes for four decades, adjusted for inflation. China\u2019s economic system, by contrast, is focused on maximizing China. And it\u2019s achieving that goal. Forty years ago China was still backward and agrarian. Today it\u2019s the world\u2019s second-largest economy, home to the world\u2019s biggest auto industry and some of the world\u2019s most powerful technology companies. Over the last four decades, hundreds of millions of Chinese people have been lifted out of poverty. The two systems are fundamentally different. At the core of the American system are 500 giant companies headquartered in the US but making, buying and selling things all over the world. Half of their employees are non-American, located outside the US. A third of their shareholders are non-American. These giant corporations have no particular allegiance to America. Their only allegiance and responsibility is to their shareholders. They\u2019ll do whatever is necessary to get their share prices as high as possible \u2013 including keeping wages down, fighting unions, reclassifying employees as independent contractors, outsourcing anywhere around world where parts are cheapest, shifting their profits around the world wherever taxes are lowest, and paying their top CEOs ludicrous sums. At the core of China\u2019s economy, by contrast, are state-owned companies that borrow from state banks at artificially low rates. These state firms balance the ups and downs of the economy, spending more when private companies are reluctant to do so. They\u2019re also engines of economic growth making the capital-intensive investments China needs to prosper, including investments in leading-edge technologies. China\u2019s core planners and state-owned companies will do whatever is necessary both to improve the wellbeing of the Chinese people and become the world\u2019s largest and most powerful economy. Since 1978, the Chinese economy has grown by an average of more than 9% per year. Growth has slowed recently, and American tariffs could bring it down to 6% or 7%, but that\u2019s still faster than almost any other economy in the world, including the US. The American system relies on taxes, subsidies and regulations to coax corporations to act in the interest of the American public. But these levers have proven weak relative to the overriding corporate goal of maximizing shareholder returns. Last week, for example, Walmart, American\u2019s largest employer, announced it would lay off 570 employees despite taking home more than $2bn courtesy of Trump and the Republican corporate tax cuts. Last year, the company closed dozens of Sam\u2019s Club stores, leaving thousands of Americans out of work. At the same time, Walmart has plowed more than $20bn into buying back shares of its own stock, which boosts the pay of Walmart executives and enriches wealthy investors but does nothing for the economy. It should be noted that Walmart is a global company, not adverse to bribing foreign officials to get its way. On Thursday it agreed to pay $282m to settle federal allegations of overseas corruption, including channeling more than $500,000 to an intermediary in Brazil known as a \u201csorceress\u201d for her ability to make construction permit problems disappear. Across the American economy, the Trump tax cut did squat for jobs and wages but did nicely for corporate executives and big investors. Instead of reinvesting the savings into their businesses, the International Monetary Fund reports that companies used it to buy back stock. But wait. America is a democracy and China is a dictatorship, right? True, but most Americans have little or no influence on public policy \u2013 which is why the Trump tax cut did so little for them. That\u2019s the conclusion of professors Martin Gilens of Princeton and Benjamin Page of Northwestern, who analyzed 1,799 policy issues before Congress and found that \u201cthe preferences of the average American appear to have only a minuscule, near-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy\u201d. Instead, American lawmakers respond to the demands of wealthy individuals (typically corporate executives and Wall Street moguls) and of big corporations, those with the most lobbying prowess and deepest pockets to bankroll campaigns. Don\u2019t blame American corporations. They\u2019re in business to make profits and maximize their share prices, not to serve America.

The factory will eventually employ about 1,000 people, which is a real bonus for the area \u2013 it\u2019s not far from Ford\u2019s Bridgend engine plant, which is due to close next September with the loss of 1,700 jobs. St Athan is a 90-acre, former MoD site. As well as the DBX, its future models will include the electric Rapid E and a zero-emission luxury Lagonda. Aston Martin has been road testing its SUV in the surrounding area \u2013 locals have grown used to spotting the heavily camouflaged car, but the distinctive front grille means it couldn\u2019t be mistaken for any other brand. Up to 5,000 a year will be built and most will be sold to Chinese buyers. Lucky them. Email Martin at martin.love@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter@MartinLove166",

Unsurprisingly, analogies to the current situation are emphasized, however subtly, throughout Wineapple\u2019s book. The author writes that \u201cthe highly unlikeable President Johnson was impeached \u2026 by men who could no longer stand his arrogance and bigotry, his apparent abuse of power, and most recently his violation of law.\u201d She notes the contrast between the \u201cmoral verdict\u201d against Johnson and the question of whether he had committed illegal actions that would justify removal from office. She highlights \u201cthe president\u2019s morbid sensitivity, his need for absolute loyalty, and his wariness\u201d. In case the analogy is not sufficiently clear, she titles one chapter \u201cResistance\u201d. Yet Johnson was acquitted by one vote. Was he guilty? The evidence seems indisputable. The secretary of war, Edwin Stanton, had been fired in violation of the Tenure of Office Act. As Stevens asked, \u201c[I]f this direct attempt of the president to violate a law made by the Congress of the United States doesn\u2019t render him liable to be impeached, what does?\u201d But the article on which Johnson was most nearly convicted was the catch-all 11th article, which accused him of offenses including violations of the separation of powers but also of autocratic actions and other behavior inconsistent with the office.

In making the attempt, highlighting the plight of African Americans and defending the powers of Congress, impeachment \u201chad not succeeded, but it had worked\u201d. One suspects this book \u2013 as well as Alexander Hamilton\u2019s Federalist Paper 65 \u2013 may be on Speaker Pelosi\u2019s nightstand.",

Faced with the reality that the Brexit they presented to voters was only ever a fantasy, they have joined Nigel Farage in clamouring for a \u201cclean\u201d Brexit \u2013 in other words, crashing out of the EU. This has resonated with Conservative members: more than half say they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jan/04/most-tory-members-would-choose-no-deal-over-may-brexit-plan\" title=\"\">prefer no deal</a> to the withdrawal agreement. The two remaining Tory leadership candidates, Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, have been shamelessly playing to this crowd; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/20/hunt-and-johnson-the-policies-personal-style-and-their-pasts\" title=\"\">even Hunt</a> has said he would countenance no deal.</p> <p>Of course, no such \u201cclean\u201d break from the EU exists. Britain is not legally prepared for a no-deal Brexit: at a minimum, the government needs to get at least <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/europe/government-prepared-no-deal/\" title=\"\">five more bills</a> through parliament. Britain would need to re-establish its independent status as a member of the WTO, not necessarily straightforward if other WTO members try to <a href=\"http://www.ictsd.org/opinion/nothing-simple-about-uk-regaining-wto-status-post-brexit\" title=\"\">extract concessions</a>. And the UK\u2019s negotiating position with the EU would be significantly weakened: once we have left, a new transitional agreement would likely require unanimous agreement from EU states, including national and regional parliaments, rather than the qualified majority required for the <a href=\"https://ukandeu.ac.uk/explainers/article-218-the-new-article-50/\" title=\"\">withdrawal agreement</a> under article 50.</p> <p>A no-deal Brexit will have destructive economic and political consequences for the country. The <a href=\"https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-8397#fullreport\" title=\"\">government\u2019s forecast</a> is that it would depress GDP between 7.7% and 9.3% over a 15-year period and it is the least affluent areas of the nation that will be hit worst in terms of jobs and growth. Moreover, a no-deal Brexit risks the breakup of the UK; it would <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-47170711\" title=\"\">increase the pressure</a> for a vote on Irish unity and fuel the campaign for Scottish independence. This does not seem to worry the Conservative members who will select our next prime minister. One poll last week suggests they are so ideological about Brexit that they are happy to countenance significant economic damage, the breakup of the union and the <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/06/18/most-conservative-members-would-see-party-destroy\" title=\"\">destruction of their own party</a> in order to see it happen. Johnson is currently expected to secure a comfortable victory among them, despite the fact that 40% believe he cannot be trusted to tell the truth.</p> <p>It has never been clearer that the Tories cannot be trusted on Brexit. In failing to rule out no deal, both Johnson and Hunt seem entirely unperturbed about its impact on the least affluent areas of the country. Why would they be, when they have been part of a government happy to load the burden of austerity on to low-income families with children?</p> <p>But last week, Jeremy Corbyn yet again refused to move Labour to a position of unambiguous support for a referendum on any Brexit deal, and a commitment Labour would campaign for Remain, despite the views of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/19/labour-mps-warn-corbyn-not-to-commit-to-second-brexit-referendum\" title=\"\">overwhelming majority</a> of party members. And while Labour remains racked by its own Brexit divisions, the Conservatives will continue to evade scrutiny for the damage they seem all too willing to wreak on Britain.</p>",

This has resonated with Conservative members: more than half say they prefer no deal to the withdrawal agreement. The two remaining Tory leadership candidates, Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, have been shamelessly playing to this crowd; even Hunt has said he would countenance no deal. Of course, no such \u201cclean\u201d break from the EU exists. Britain is not legally prepared for a no-deal Brexit: at a minimum, the government needs to get at least five more bills through parliament. Britain would need to re-establish its independent status as a member of the WTO, not necessarily straightforward if other WTO members try to extract concessions. And the UK\u2019s negotiating position with the EU would be significantly weakened: once we have left, a new transitional agreement would likely require unanimous agreement from EU states, including national and regional parliaments, rather than the qualified majority required for the withdrawal agreement under article 50. A no-deal Brexit will have destructive economic and political consequences for the country. The government\u2019s forecast is that it would depress GDP between 7.7% and 9.3% over a 15-year period and it is the least affluent areas of the nation that will be hit worst in terms of jobs and growth. Moreover, a no-deal Brexit risks the breakup of the UK; it would increase the pressure for a vote on Irish unity and fuel the campaign for Scottish independence. This does not seem to worry the Conservative members who will select our next prime minister. One poll last week suggests they are so ideological about Brexit that they are happy to countenance significant economic damage, the breakup of the union and the destruction of their own party in order to see it happen. Johnson is currently expected to secure a comfortable victory among them, despite the fact that 40% believe he cannot be trusted to tell the truth. It has never been clearer that the Tories cannot be trusted on Brexit. In failing to rule out no deal, both Johnson and Hunt seem entirely unperturbed about its impact on the least affluent areas of the country. Why would they be, when they have been part of a government happy to load the burden of austerity on to low-income families with children? But last week, Jeremy Corbyn yet again refused to move Labour to a position of unambiguous support for a referendum on any Brexit deal, and a commitment Labour would campaign for Remain, despite the views of the overwhelming majority of party members. And while Labour remains racked by its own Brexit divisions, the Conservatives will continue to evade scrutiny for the damage they seem all too willing to wreak on Britain.",

      "body": "<p><strong>State Bicycle Co 4130 Road<br>Price</strong> \u00a3549.99, <a href=\"https://www.statebicycle.co.uk/\">statebicycle.co.uk</a><br><strong>Frame</strong> steel<br><strong>Gears</strong> 8 speed<br><strong>Sizes</strong> 49cm to 62cm</p> <p>About 20 years ago I went for my first \u201cproper\u201d bike ride. I borrowed a knackered old frame from a friend and rather randomly set my sights on Tunbridge Wells, mostly because it was about 40 miles from where I lived and there was a direct train back home.</p> <p>It ended in disaster. I had three punctures, broke a pedal and ended up walking for miles along the hard shoulder of the A21. Finally, I reached a pub and had to call my wife to ask her to fetch me. To this day I don\u2019t know how I managed to make such a meal of a ride I can now do in my sleep.</p> <p>There was one bright spot, however. After my second puncture, as I was sitting on a grass verge considering my options (I\u2019d only brought one spare patch), two riders in their 70s stopped. They were from <a href=\"http://pengecycleclub.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Penge Cycling Club</a> in southeast London. One fixed my wheel, while the other opened his flask and shared out homemade flapjacks. I rode on with them for a few miles, enjoying their stories \u2013 they had more than 100 years of cycling derring-do between them \u2013 and struggling to keep up with the effortless cadence of their wiry old legs. They were an inspiration and I still think of them when I head out towards Tunbridge Wells \u2013 and I always salute the grass bank where they came to my aid.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I always salute the grass bank where they came to my aid</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I also think of them when I see a classic steel bike like this one from the <a href=\"https://www.statebicycle.co.uk/\">State Bicycle Co</a>. The brand was launched a decade ago by three cycle-crazy mates from Arizona. That\u2019s about as far as you can get from Penge, but those two OAPs would have loved this bike. They\u2019d appreciate its slim frame, flat top tube, traditional 60s colour scheme and those lovely tan-walled tyres.</p> <p>State made its name building hip, urban, single-speed and fixed-gear bikes \u2013 beards, tattoos and an obsession with beer brewing are almost mandatory. The 4130, however, is a big departure. It\u2019s the first time the company has added gears to one of its bikes. The 8-speed drivetrain shifts using a down-tube lever. It\u2019s a durable, low-maintenance option that also harks back to the way vintage bikes were built. The single chain ring is in a natural, old-school aluminium finish. The Penge pensioners told me that back in their heyday, when your gear shifters were always mounted on the down tube, it was common for opponents to ride dirty by leaning over and flicking you out of gear during hill races, which meant a dramatic and often dangerous loss of momentum. It wasn\u2019t all sepia-tinted romance back in the day.</p> <p>The 4130 has more vintage-inspired details on its brake levers, hubs, pad holders and saddle. But the bike also considers the needs of modern riders. There are lugs for racks and mudguards, and room to fit wider 32mm tyres as used on gravel bikes for better comfort and stability.</p> <p>For anyone wanting to get into riding on a modern bike that comes packed with classic charm, the 4130 is an affordable and rewarding choice. But remember, whatever the era, you won\u2019t get far without a couple of spare tubes and a flapjack in your pocket.</p> <h2>Cool kit</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5c8f610d6cdffad02704f7f0fdc1e33434bed071\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c8f610d6cdffad02704f7f0fdc1e33434bed071/0_340_3200_3621/884.jpg\" alt=\"icebreker Men\u2019s Tech-Lite Crewe Cook Crest, \u00a365, www.icebreaker.com (adventure)\" width=\"884\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Wear it more, but wash it less.

      "bodyText": "State Bicycle Co 4130 Road Price \u00a3549.99, statebicycle.co.uk Frame steel Gears 8 speed Sizes 49cm to 62cm About 20 years ago I went for my first \u201cproper\u201d bike ride. I borrowed a knackered old frame from a friend and rather randomly set my sights on Tunbridge Wells, mostly because it was about 40 miles from where I lived and there was a direct train back home. It ended in disaster. I had three punctures, broke a pedal and ended up walking for miles along the hard shoulder of the A21. Finally, I reached a pub and had to call my wife to ask her to fetch me. To this day I don\u2019t know how I managed to make such a meal of a ride I can now do in my sleep. There was one bright spot, however. After my second puncture, as I was sitting on a grass verge considering my options (I\u2019d only brought one spare patch), two riders in their 70s stopped. They were from Penge Cycling Club in southeast London. One fixed my wheel, while the other opened his flask and shared out homemade flapjacks. I rode on with them for a few miles, enjoying their stories \u2013 they had more than 100 years of cycling derring-do between them \u2013 and struggling to keep up with the effortless cadence of their wiry old legs. They were an inspiration and I still think of them when I head out towards Tunbridge Wells \u2013 and I always salute the grass bank where they came to my aid. I also think of them when I see a classic steel bike like this one from the State Bicycle Co. The brand was launched a decade ago by three cycle-crazy mates from Arizona. That\u2019s about as far as you can get from Penge, but those two OAPs would have loved this bike. They\u2019d appreciate its slim frame, flat top tube, traditional 60s colour scheme and those lovely tan-walled tyres. State made its name building hip, urban, single-speed and fixed-gear bikes \u2013 beards, tattoos and an obsession with beer brewing are almost mandatory. The 4130, however, is a big departure. It\u2019s the first time the company has added gears to one of its bikes. The 8-speed drivetrain shifts using a down-tube lever. It\u2019s a durable, low-maintenance option that also harks back to the way vintage bikes were built. The single chain ring is in a natural, old-school aluminium finish. The Penge pensioners told me that back in their heyday, when your gear shifters were always mounted on the down tube, it was common for opponents to ride dirty by leaning over and flicking you out of gear during hill races, which meant a dramatic and often dangerous loss of momentum. It wasn\u2019t all sepia-tinted romance back in the day. The 4130 has more vintage-inspired details on its brake levers, hubs, pad holders and saddle. But the bike also considers the needs of modern riders. There are lugs for racks and mudguards, and room to fit wider 32mm tyres as used on gravel bikes for better comfort and stability. For anyone wanting to get into riding on a modern bike that comes packed with classic charm, the 4130 is an affordable and rewarding choice. But remember, whatever the era, you won\u2019t get far without a couple of spare tubes and a flapjack in your pocket. Cool kit Wear it more, but wash it less.

The onus is on the cruise industry to work with the local governments wherever big ships dock.</p> <p>In the rush to make money out of the current cruise boom, surely those benefiting should not just be the happy cruisers and the postcard sellers but the whole community.

I first noticed Lowry when I was a boy growing up in the early 60s in Stockport, one of his favourite locations for his paintings. Seeing some prints in a cafe, I suddenly realised that these were pictures of the places and people where I lived. To see my community celebrated in art was, and remains, an emancipatory experience.</p> <p>I must disagree with Vanessa Thorpe when she says Lowry saw beauty in the city. Apart from the melancholy that seeps through his paintings, they are exercises in the detached observation of the social reality of the industrial scene, not exercises in aesthetic contemplation.</p> <p>Adrian Noble, the film\u2019s director, is right that there are still some vestiges of snobbery in the art world about Lowry. If you are popular, northern, working class and your art is understandable, they don\u2019t really know what to make of you. In 2013, Tate Britain finally had a retrospective that was well received. At the curator\u2019s talk at the end of the show, all was going well until the concluding comments that they had \u201ceven had people from the north coming down in coaches to see it\u201d. <br><strong>Bob Gaunt</strong><br>Mytholmroyd, West Yorks<br></p> <h2>Ken\u2019s story is not all pants<br></h2> <p>Rachel Cooke expresses doubts about one part of Ken Livingstone\u2019s childhood story: \u201cLivingstone makes a lot of his hardscrabble beginnings: one pair of socks and one pair of pants used to have to last all week, or so he says\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/16/ken-livingstone-labour-brexit-antisemitism\" title=\"\">Interview</a>, New Review).

The rise in demand for cruising is being fuelled by an industry intent on getting as many eggs as possible out of its new golden goose. Cruise liners are really just floating, all-inclusive resorts, a model of tourism notorious for keeping as much profit as possible in house or, in this case, onboard. Companies have little inclination to work with the local authorities on encouraging their clients to spend on shore, let alone consider how their presence is really affecting the communities they spend a few brief hours with. The onus is on the cruise industry to work with the local governments wherever big ships dock. In the rush to make money out of the current cruise boom, surely those benefiting should not just be the happy cruisers and the postcard sellers but the whole community. Otherwise we will be seeing many more banners like those already in Barcelona and Venice saying \u201cGo home\u201d, not \u201cwelcome\u201d. Alison Stancliffe Newcastle upon Tyne A leader with empathy, please It\u2019s troubling to read that 86% of people polled recently say that the UK needs a strong leader (\u201cDivided, pessimistic, angry: survey reveals bleak mood of pre-Brexit UK\u201d, News). Voters in 1930s Germany were thinking the same thing when they chose Hitler. What we really need is a leader with intelligence, empathy and flexibility, not attributes that would describe Boris Johnson, unless someone mistook a mixture of Latin and self-serving guile for intelligence, or, indeed, any of the other Conservative candidates, one of whom will soon be foisted on us as prime minister by a tiny minority of the population. Karin Barry London W10 I share the eminent statesman Kenneth Clarke\u2019s alarm at the conduct of the governing party as it selects a new leader \u2013 \u201ca tragic farce\u201d \u2013 but note that he makes no connection between this national impasse and the cruel and economically unnecessary austerity policies, for which he voted as a Conservative MP, that led to it. Dr Sebastian Kraemer London SW2 Falling in love with Lowry I was pleased to read about the film being made about LS Lowry (\u201cWill Lowry film propel the man and his town into art world\u2019s top rank?\u201d, News). I first noticed Lowry when I was a boy growing up in the early 60s in Stockport, one of his favourite locations for his paintings. Seeing some prints in a cafe, I suddenly realised that these were pictures of the places and people where I lived. To see my community celebrated in art was, and remains, an emancipatory experience. I must disagree with Vanessa Thorpe when she says Lowry saw beauty in the city. Apart from the melancholy that seeps through his paintings, they are exercises in the detached observation of the social reality of the industrial scene, not exercises in aesthetic contemplation. Adrian Noble, the film\u2019s director, is right that there are still some vestiges of snobbery in the art world about Lowry. If you are popular, northern, working class and your art is understandable, they don\u2019t really know what to make of you. In 2013, Tate Britain finally had a retrospective that was well received. At the curator\u2019s talk at the end of the show, all was going well until the concluding comments that they had \u201ceven had people from the north coming down in coaches to see it\u201d. Bob Gaunt Mytholmroyd, West Yorks Ken\u2019s story is not all pants Rachel Cooke expresses doubts about one part of Ken Livingstone\u2019s childhood story: \u201cLivingstone makes a lot of his hardscrabble beginnings: one pair of socks and one pair of pants used to have to last all week, or so he says\u201d (Interview, New Review). Can I assure you that for working-class boys in London during the 50s and 60s that was standard issue. It is why our teachers were so keen for us to have a weekly swimming lesson.

Or to put it another way, it\u2019s completely nuts. Alongside a list of steaks, another of street food, a third of mussels (five different ways, in three different sizes), salads, flatbreads, sauces and more than a dozen sides, there\u2019s also a bunch of ramen. There\u2019s no reason why the good people of Guernsey shouldn\u2019t have access to ramen, but it does make the kitchen seem very eager to please.</p> <p>Look, here\u2019s the specials menu: three <em>plats du jour</em> at \u00a313 each, a main course, a whole turbot to share for \u00a365, and three nibbles. We get one of these: scallop \u201cbeards\u201d, the frilly skirts cut away when the meat is liberated from the shell, floured and deep-fried to golden and served with a bowl of punchy rouille.

But the key to the <a href=\"https://octopusgsy.co.uk/menu\" title=\"\">menu</a> here lies in the middle, where there\u2019s a list entitled Crab Shack, offering oysters, whole crabs, lobster and various fish of the day served in ways many and various.

We choose the spicy bouillabaisse jus with fennel and chorizo with both whole crab and lobster to share, for what, at \u00a349, is good value. The waiter asks us if we\u2019d like a bigger lobster. I ask him how much. Instead of answering he returns with a tea towel-covered tray and pulls it back to reveal two fine, blue-grey creatures, claws twitching. He points to the bigger one.

They say it\u2019s for one or two, but it could easily feed three. There is an ocean-deep broth that is nothing like either a bouillabaisse or a jus, but is spiced and ripe with tomato and chilli and the liquor the best shellfish offers up as it meets its end. We pull the meat from the lobster and crab, our shells heaping up in the bucket before us. We dig around for scallops and prawns, and suck the debris off the mussel shells. It\u2019s completely engrossing, a single dish which for some is worth not only its own price, but also that of a flight.

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison\u2019s government is reigniting its campaign to bring back legislation enabling it to deregister unions, using the controversy surrounding Victorian CFMMEU boss John Setka as a launch pad. In an interview with the Australian Financial Review last week, Christian Porter, who has responsibility for industrial relations in Morrison\u2019s new cabinet, said he believed the Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union should be deregistered over what he called an \u201cextraordinarily high standard of unlawful activity\u201d. The government lost the fight to pass its \u201censuring integrity\u201d bill in the last parliament, which would have given the federal court the power to fine and eventually deregister organisations found \u201cunlawful\u201d. Deregistered organisations would lose bargaining privileges and workplace entry rights, as well as their tax exempt status. Union officials could also be individually targeted, and lose their status through federal court rulings, under the legislation. Speaking to Sky News on Sunday, the assistant treasurer, Michael Sukkar, agreed with Porter that the CFMMEU should be deregistered and demanded the Labor party support the government\u2019s legislation, in order for it to pass. \u201cThe Labor party could assist the CFMMEU and other rogue organisations reform themselves and improve their performance and improve they way they operate within the law by actually putting some pressure on them,\u201d Sukkar said. \u201cI think there is a very good argument to be made that says if you don\u2019t deregister organisations like the current CFMMEU then which organisation would ever qualify to be deregistered?\u201d Anthony Albanese\u2019s call to expel Setka from the Labor party when its national executive meets early next month set off a firestorm of responses from within the union movement, which has accused the Labor leader of attempting to meddle in union affairs. Setka will return to court this week on charges including using a carriage service to harass a woman. Labor\u2019s national executive will meet on 5 July to discuss Setka\u2019s on-going membership of the party and it is likely to accept the political leadership\u2019s call to cancel his membership.

The Victorian branch of the CFMMEU and other members of the Victorian left have demanded public shows of support for Setka, as well as threats to cut off financial and in-kind support to the Labor party. Union leaders in support of Setka have also demanded an investigation into leaks from the CFMMEU national executive, as well as threats to no longer recognise the traditional demarcation lines within the union movement, for those organisations that have joined McManus\u2019s call for Setka to step aside.

      "bodyText": "Labor\u2019s senior leadership is doubling down on the claim $200,000 a year no longer represents the \u201ctop end of town\u201d. The shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said Labor\u2019s priority remained on helping to pass increased tax offsets for low and middle-class workers but echoed his leader\u2019s comments that a $200,000 wage was \u201caspirational\u201d and not necessarily wealthy. Anthony Albanese first made the comment to Sky News on Friday, when discussing Labor\u2019s position on the stage three of the government\u2019s tax plan, which would put someone earning $45,000 on the same tax rate as someone earning $200,000. In an interview with the ABC on Sunday, Chalmers agreed that a worker on $200,000 a year was not the \u201ctop end of town\u201d. \u201cFirst of all, we accept that some of the language that we used in the last term, and I used in the last term, didn\u2019t strike the right chord in the Australian community,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do acknowledge that. The second point that Anthony is making there is that if you\u2019re on a good wicket in this country, we say \u2018good on you\u2019. That is a good thing. \u201cWe want more people doing well. We want more people earning more and looking after their families. We want more people finding themselves on a good wicket in the workplace. \u201cThat is, in essence, what Labor is all about. The government talks about aspiration as a sort of marketing term that they learned from a focus group. \u201cFor Labor, aspiration is about opportunity. And providing more opportunity for more people is our reason for being in the Labor party. And that means better jobs, better wages, better training \u2013 all of those things which actually give life to the aspirational instinct that people have in this country.\u201d After an election campaign based on inequality, Labor has pivoted its message, in an attempt to nullify the government\u2019s \u201cclass warfare\u201d attack lines, while finalising its position on the government\u2019s legislation, which the Coalition intends on putting through as an \u201call or nothing deal\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t regard someone who\u2019s earning $200,000 a year as being from the top end of town,\u201d Albanese said on Friday. \u201cI regard many people, of course in trades, many people who are earning a good living, who work.

What it\u2019s a question of though is, in terms of the economic policy that\u2019s required, my concern is the government is looking at tax, but what\u2019s their policy on wages?\u201d In 2017, the ABS reported, Australia\u2019s median weekly pay was just over $1,000 a week. The government needs Labor to agree to pass through its entire tax cut in order to avoid striking deals with the Senate crossbench, with both One Nation and Centre Alliance hesitating over the third stage of the $158bn package, of which $95bn hits the budget in 2024. Labor\u2019s shadow cabinet will meet on Monday to discuss its position, with the conversation split between allowing the package to pass through to ensure the tax cuts for lower and middle income earners, and continuing to resist the third stage. \u201cOur highest priority is to get money into the hands of workers, and flowing through an economy which desperately needs it,\u201d Chalmers said. He said the government\u2019s highest priority seemed to be the third stage of the plan that does not come in for another five years. \u201cWe want to know what that would mean for the budget and what that would mean for the economy, and the information that they don\u2019t want to provide us,\u201d Chalmers said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge outlay of money ... so, I think that the Australian people expect us to get all of the information, to have the proper consultations and considerations before we come to a final view.\u201d The assistant treasurer, Michael Sukkar, repeated the government\u2019s claim it has a mandate to pass the entire tax plan, and maintained it would not be splitting the bill to ease its passage. \u201cA plan like this all hangs together,\u201d Sukkar told Sky News. \u201cThe Labor party wants to cherrypick one or the other parts of the plan which they did before the election and they have been rebuffed by the Australian people.\u201d The Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe, who could announce another interest rate cut when his central bank board meets on 2 July, has urged parliament to use fiscal policy to help lift a slowing economy.

On one side, the sun is eclipsed by a vast warehouse and sagging palm trees lean over the four courts where Barty spent her childhood lobbing balls back and forward.

Barty identifies strongly as Indigenous Australian \u2013 \u201cmy heritage is really important to me\u201d.</p> \n<p>Retired tennis champion and Channel Nine sports broadcaster Todd Woodbridge first met Barty when he was running development programs for Tennis Australia. \u201cShe came on to our radar around 11 or 12,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat stood out at that particular time was her ability to have soft hands and be creative with the tennis, not just whacking a ball aimlessly. There was already that intuition of a crafty player. She always had what I call a placid nature. What she has been blessed with is having parents who have handled her almost perfectly, supported her and guided her, and kept pressure away from her as much as possible.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1f8fdaa1cb95a3c3ad743fe926687d0e2a3ae2a2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f8fdaa1cb95a3c3ad743fe926687d0e2a3ae2a2/0_329_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ashleigh Barty at Roland Garros with the French Open 2019 trophy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ashleigh Barty at Roland Garros with the French Open 2019 trophy.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Like any elite athlete, Barty has sacrificed her childhood and teenage years to the game \u2013 to endlessly hitting the ball over the net, to the thousands of hours of training, to being a perfectionist. By 14, she had been chosen for international tours, but was lonely and homesick, phoning home from Europe in tears, too young to be so far away from family. One year she was home for only 27 days. At 15, she won Junior Wimbledon, Overwhelmed by the attention, she bolted home, where she faced more fanfare. \u201cIt was crazy\u201d <a href=\"https://www.playersvoice.com.au/the-special-one-our-sister-ash/2/#j7FGy4ekV3w6SdUR.97\">say her sisters</a> of the people waiting to greet her at the airport.</p> \n<p>The satisfaction of being so good at the game had gotten lost in the celebrity and media frenzy, the pressure, the expectations.

When you have a few losses, your self-worth is examined and that becomes really challenging for a teenager or someone in their early 20s.

Barty took medication for depression for two years and consulted a therapist, learning to open up.</p> \n<p>During that time, Andy Richards, coach of the Brisbane Heat cricket team, heard that she had joked about taking up cricket, and gave her a call. \u201cWe had a chat and a coffee and went and hit some balls. She was a bowling machine, she hit 150 balls and probably mistimed five or six. She had never played before. She fitted into the squad very quickly and easily.</p> \n<p>\u201cShe was honest and open about her struggles. She got obsessed with the training and we would have to tell her she didn\u2019t have to come in and hit balls everyday. She said I just want to play a sport that has got a stick in it.</p> \n<p>\u201cShe is a freak,\u201d Richards says.</p> \n<p>Her 18 months with Brisbane Heat was a time of healing for Barty, a chance to live a normal life, to grow. She got to take back some of those teenage years she had missed. After a game, the girls would go out for a beer, something she had never done before. \u201cShe found out what it meant to have friends, and teammates\u201d says Richards. At the beginning, he invited her to a camp, \u201cin a gully where we did a lot of night hiking and crawling through mud. I have got a video of her neck deep in mud, with a massive smile on her face\u201d.</p> \n<p>In her spare time, Barty would coach tennis students along with Joyce, sometimes hinting at opening her own tennis school.</p> \n<p>\u201cI thought she would never go back to tennis, I thought that was it,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/breakfast/french-open-champion-ash-bartys-father-reflects-on-her-rise/11201370\">Robert Barty said recently.</a> We never raised it, and one day we came home and there were four boxes of tennis balls on the front door step. And that was Ash going back to tennis.\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vphoIbmHiI\">Later she would say</a> she had \u201cmissed the ebbs and flows, the emotions you get from winning and losing, they are unique. When you put yourself out on a line, you become vulnerable and try and do things that no one ever thinks of.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/21/ashleigh-barty-andy-murray-wimbledon\">Ashleigh Barty sorry she had to reject Andy Murray\u2019s Wimbledon offer</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Woodbridge believes that \u201cbuying that time bought confidence and experience\u201d for Barty.</p> \n<p> Her comeback is the stuff of sporting legend. When she returned to the game in June 2016, she was unranked. She started again at the bottom, playing constantly at minor events across the world, sweating for every point. Within six months, she had gained a ranking of 325. From then on, her ascendancy was supersonic \u2013 she was mowing down the world\u2019s most celebrated and seeded players. \u201cI can still remember 12 months ago when she cracked the top hundred, she sent a text. Josie wondered if she would ever be seeded,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/breakfast/french-open-champion-ash-bartys-father-reflects-on-her-rise/11201370\">Robert has said.</a></p> \n<p>It was only three years after she walked away from tennis that Barty won the French Open, in a straight sets victory, becoming world No 2 \u2013 48 years after her hero Goolagong did the same. This time, the girl from Springfield embraced it. This time \u2013 at the right time \u2013 all the different parts of Ash Barty fell perfectly into place.</p> \n<p>Kieran Gibbs, a sports coordinator at South West Indigenous Network, is a Githabul and Kooma man who has known Barty since she played cricket. He now works with her as a national Indigenous tennis ambassador and told Guardian Australia \u201cshe is really shy, quite reserved, quiet \u2013 a really simple relaxed, just-goes-about-her-business type person\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cPart of our culture is genuine respect and respecting your elders and respecting your other mob. It is about remembering who you are, and what you are and displaying that every day. Ash is showing who we are to the world.\u201d</p>",

Springfield, south-west of Brisbane, is Australia\u2019s first privately built city, and the country\u2019s largest master-planned community. This carefully organised, middle-class world of family homes is where Ashleigh Barty grew up in warm winter sun, surrounded by straggly Australian bush. And it\u2019s where tennis\u2019s golden girl \u2013 now just one win away from becoming world No 1 \u2013 still lives, five minutes from her parents. Her father, Robert, works in the government and is a Ngaragu Indigenous Australian on his maternal side; her mother, Josie, the daughter of English immigrants, is a radiographer. Robert was an amateur golf champion in the 80s. It was a typical Australian household, where the sporting activities of the children were central to family life. And it became apparent early that this youngest daughter was something else. Barty was only four when she found an old squash racket and started bashing balls against the garage wall for hours. Her father rang the local coach Jim Joyce at West Brisbane Tennis Centre. \u201cHe said \u2018we don\u2019t take them until they are eight\u2019,\u201d Robert has said. \u201cWe went down and he threw her a ball and she whacked it over his head. She kept doing that until he said \u2018you can come back next week\u2019. He said she had it written all over her face.\u201d West Brisbane Tennis Centre is a small oasis in a sprawling industrial landscape, with tankers and trucks thundering down the road outside. At a gate there is a sign saying \u201cOpen 7 Days\u201d. Usually Joyce can be seen on the courts, patiently coaching energetic children in sun visors. But now he\u2019s on his way to Wimbledon. On one side, the sun is eclipsed by a vast warehouse and sagging palm trees lean over the four courts where Barty spent her childhood lobbing balls back and forward. Because she was, and is, small, Joyce devised a game that was varied and creative \u2013 techniques that remain integral to her game today. \u201cHer focus and concentration were just incredible\u201d Joyce has said. By the age of nine, she was playing against 15-year-old boys, and by 15 she was playing against adults. While Joyce worked with her prodigious skill, he also gave her another kind of foundation, that of being a decent human being. Robert told the ABC: \u201cJim had four criteria, to be a nice person, to have fun, to be respected and respect others, and if you can play tennis after that it would be a bonus.\u201d As she won tournament after tournament and trophy after trophy, Robert and Josie echoed Joyce with their own values. \u201cHer tennis achievements are obvious but we are most proud of the way she conducts herself, in tennis and in life,\u201d Robert says now. \u201cThe way Ash treats her family, her friends, her team and anyone around her is a reflection of what a wonderful girl she is.\u201d When they were teenagers, Barty and her sisters embraced their Indigenous background, learning about the Ngaragu people and registering with the clan. Barty identifies strongly as Indigenous Australian \u2013 \u201cmy heritage is really important to me\u201d. Retired tennis champion and Channel Nine sports broadcaster Todd Woodbridge first met Barty when he was running development programs for Tennis Australia. \u201cShe came on to our radar around 11 or 12,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat stood out at that particular time was her ability to have soft hands and be creative with the tennis, not just whacking a ball aimlessly. There was already that intuition of a crafty player. She always had what I call a placid nature. What she has been blessed with is having parents who have handled her almost perfectly, supported her and guided her, and kept pressure away from her as much as possible.\u201d Like any elite athlete, Barty has sacrificed her childhood and teenage years to the game \u2013 to endlessly hitting the ball over the net, to the thousands of hours of training, to being a perfectionist. By 14, she had been chosen for international tours, but was lonely and homesick, phoning home from Europe in tears, too young to be so far away from family. One year she was home for only 27 days. At 15, she won Junior Wimbledon, Overwhelmed by the attention, she bolted home, where she faced more fanfare. \u201cIt was crazy\u201d say her sisters of the people waiting to greet her at the airport. The satisfaction of being so good at the game had gotten lost in the celebrity and media frenzy, the pressure, the expectations. Moving to Melbourne, Barty kept training for another year, sliding into depression \u2013 until she just couldn\u2019t do it anymore. Says Woodbridge: \u201cEverything relates to a win and loss. When you have a few losses, your self-worth is examined and that becomes really challenging for a teenager or someone in their early 20s. Because you think you are failing and that causes huge anxiety.\u201d Barty had always been the sort of person to internalise, according to her sisters, and now she withdrew completely. Her mentor and role model Australian tennis legend Evonne Goolagong Cawley sent her a text telling her it was a good decision and to go fishing. It was a tremendous relief. When the dazzling prodigy walked away from tennis, no one understood more than her father. \u201cWhen she decided to finish tennis, we knew she was struggling, but we didn\u2019t realise how much she didn\u2019t like the attention and the limelight. We said \u2018OK you have got to be happy darl, we are here to support you through the whole process\u2019.\u201d Robert said he too had suffered from manic depression and might have passed it on to his daughter. Barty took medication for depression for two years and consulted a therapist, learning to open up. During that time, Andy Richards, coach of the Brisbane Heat cricket team, heard that she had joked about taking up cricket, and gave her a call. \u201cWe had a chat and a coffee and went and hit some balls. She was a bowling machine, she hit 150 balls and probably mistimed five or six. She had never played before. She fitted into the squad very quickly and easily. \u201cShe was honest and open about her struggles. She got obsessed with the training and we would have to tell her she didn\u2019t have to come in and hit balls everyday. She said I just want to play a sport that has got a stick in it. \u201cShe is a freak,\u201d Richards says. Her 18 months with Brisbane Heat was a time of healing for Barty, a chance to live a normal life, to grow. She got to take back some of those teenage years she had missed. After a game, the girls would go out for a beer, something she had never done before. \u201cShe found out what it meant to have friends, and teammates\u201d says Richards. At the beginning, he invited her to a camp, \u201cin a gully where we did a lot of night hiking and crawling through mud. I have got a video of her neck deep in mud, with a massive smile on her face\u201d. In her spare time, Barty would coach tennis students along with Joyce, sometimes hinting at opening her own tennis school. \u201cI thought she would never go back to tennis, I thought that was it,\u201d Robert Barty said recently. We never raised it, and one day we came home and there were four boxes of tennis balls on the front door step. And that was Ash going back to tennis.\u201d Later she would say she had \u201cmissed the ebbs and flows, the emotions you get from winning and losing, they are unique. When you put yourself out on a line, you become vulnerable and try and do things that no one ever thinks of.\u201d Woodbridge believes that \u201cbuying that time bought confidence and experience\u201d for Barty. Her comeback is the stuff of sporting legend. When she returned to the game in June 2016, she was unranked. She started again at the bottom, playing constantly at minor events across the world, sweating for every point. Within six months, she had gained a ranking of 325. From then on, her ascendancy was supersonic \u2013 she was mowing down the world\u2019s most celebrated and seeded players. \u201cI can still remember 12 months ago when she cracked the top hundred, she sent a text. Josie wondered if she would ever be seeded,\u201d Robert has said. It was only three years after she walked away from tennis that Barty won the French Open, in a straight sets victory, becoming world No 2 \u2013 48 years after her hero Goolagong did the same. This time, the girl from Springfield embraced it. This time \u2013 at the right time \u2013 all the different parts of Ash Barty fell perfectly into place. Kieran Gibbs, a sports coordinator at South West Indigenous Network, is a Githabul and Kooma man who has known Barty since she played cricket. He now works with her as a national Indigenous tennis ambassador and told Guardian Australia \u201cshe is really shy, quite reserved, quiet \u2013 a really simple relaxed, just-goes-about-her-business type person\u201d. \u201cPart of our culture is genuine respect and respecting your elders and respecting your other mob. It is about remembering who you are, and what you are and displaying that every day. Ash is showing who we are to the world.\u201d",

The story we\u2019ve been told is that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-election-2019\">Coalition\u2019s win</a> means that \u201cAustralian voters\u201d have rejected Labor\u2019s radical plan for reform of the tax-and-spend system, confirming that Australians prefer stability and incremental change.</p> <p>Yet if one in 50 (2%) had voted the other way the pundits would have junked this narrative and told us, with great authority, that by endorsing Labor\u2019s vision \u201cAustralian voters\u201d showed they\u2019re ready to embrace change.</p> <p>One in 50 could have switched to Labor if Clive Palmer had decided to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/28/the-sixty-million-dollar-man-how-clive-palmer-is-funding-his-own-political-resurrection\">spend his $60m</a> on a new house instead of an election. Or if Labor had chosen a more credible leader. Or if, a week before election day, a minister had been outed cheating on his expenses. Yet such a random event would then have caused the pundits to offer a sharply different analysis of the state of Australian society.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2018/oct/13/dear-progressives-craig-kelly-abbott-and-trump-are-making-you-their-stooge\">Dear progressives: Craig Kelly, Abbott and Trump are making you their stooge | Simon Black</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Poring over the seats won and lost, analysts have observed that many people voted against their economic interests, both at the lower end and the upper end. Some electorates dominated by low- and middle-income households, especially in the regions, voted conservative even though they would have gained from Labor\u2019s plan to rebalance the tax system to benefit low-income households. Many in the wealthiest electorates shifted to Labor even though their taxes would be higher.</p> <p>It\u2019s a phenomenon <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2018/06/05/why-people-vote-against-their-economic-interests\">noted</a> a few years ago in the US. Donald Trump promised huge tax cuts for the rich and no change to a desperately unfair health system, yet millions of Americans on the margins voted for him. Trump duly delivered on his promises and they still support him.</p> <p>Labor\u2019s inability to attract enough votes has been blamed on its unduly complicated message. Some say its marketing misfired. People were confused and so voted against their own interests. The answer is a simpler message marketed more effectively, and by a leader who is more relatable. And Labor must cut back on the promises of improving the tax-and-welfare system because voters could not understand it, or because they are prey to scare campaigns.</p> <p>In other words, they blame confusion for voters\u2019 irrational behaviour. But it\u2019s more plausible that those who vote against their economic interests are as rational as other voters; it\u2019s just that they don\u2019t behave according to the pundit\u2019s mental model \u2013 in which economic interests guide rational voting behaviour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"89a7c034596bb2bd181f34c1ad409a7d87dfa0ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89a7c034596bb2bd181f34c1ad409a7d87dfa0ac/0_0_4500_2830/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump addresses a campaign rally in 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"629\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump\u2019s message was: \u2018You\u2019re losing the world you know, the one that gives you a firm identity, and I will bring it back.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For these citizens voting is less about economics than about culture. They are voting to protect a culture, that is, a social environment and way of life made up of values, behaviours and symbols that accord with their sense of who they are and where they fit. Those in wealthy suburbs who vote against their economic interests by supporting Labor or the Greens are also voting for culture; in their case, they want to <em>change</em> it.</p> <p>The argument that \u201cmoney doesn\u2019t buy happiness\u201d is typically attributed to the comfortable middle classes, but it can apply at the other end too. At the lower end, those who vote against their economic interests might be worse off under a conservative government, but they will <em>feel</em> better because of the psychic wages they receive from knowing their anxieties are being recognised and addressed. These psychic wages compensate for any decline in material living standards.</p> <p>Progressives often have trouble understanding that culture can trump economics and around the world they are losing elections because the power of culture is growing while they continue to speak the old language. Culture now matters more than class, which is a dilemma for progressives in the cities who support the class interests of low-income people in the regions but represent a culture that many in the regions resent.</p> <h2><strong>The state of culture</strong></h2> <p>The message of Donald Trump\u2019s slogan \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d was: \u201cYou\u2019re losing the world you know, the one that gives you a firm identity, and I will bring it back.\u201d In Australia, it\u2019s the same sentiment that the Coalition, with the help of shock jocks and conservative commentators, has been exploiting, not least with its attacks on political correctness and defence of \u201creligious freedom\u201d.</p> <p>In regional Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania, where Labor performed very badly, the culture many identify with is a nostalgic, inward-looking one resentful towards the cities. One Nation attracted the votes of this cohort and channelled them to the Liberal and National parties.</p> <p>It should be remembered that low-income electorates in the big cities still voted solidly for Labor. But over the last decades a new kind of voter has emerged, one driven by cultural anxiety, who no longer feels that Australia is the country he or she grew up in. And it\u2019s not.</p> <p>It\u2019s partly due to immigration, a situation created by John Howard as much as anyone else when he allowed a huge increase in the rate of migration, making parts of Australia\u2019s cities feel alien. Feeling like \u201ca stranger in my own country\u201d is perhaps stronger among those who look on from elsewhere rather than those living in it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3a55f0ddcf4f728bf9a562974f5789d3c42c0e20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a55f0ddcf4f728bf9a562974f5789d3c42c0e20/0_269_5468_3282/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Latham backed by Pauline Hanson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Latham \u2013 \u2018the most articulate spokesman for the alienated white working class\u2019 \u2013 backed by Pauline Hanson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joel Carrett/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the New South Wales Labor leader Michael Daley was forced out of office for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/mar/19/michael-daley-claims-asian-workers-taking-young-peoples-jobs-in-sydney\">saying</a> that \u201cour kids\u201d are fleeing Sydney and being replaced by Asian immigrants with PhDs, in many parts of Australia people felt he spoke to their anxieties \u2013 even those who can\u2019t stomach the race-baiting of Pauline Hanson.</p> <p>The most articulate spokesman for the alienated \u201cwhite working class\u201d is Mark Latham, who arguably foreshadowed the Trump model. Speaking after the election, on Sky After Dark, he bitterly <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XXUc-gdao4\">denounced</a> the inner-city lefty elites in defence of those who \u201chate the idea of a Plibersek, a Wong, a Keneally patronising and condescending and constantly inferring there\u2019s something wrong with working people and only these elites know how working people should run their lives\u201d. (Like One Nation, Latham has a woman problem.)</p> <p>Les Murray is their poet. Success heaped accolades and money on Murray but it could never wipe away the seething resentment he felt at being looked down upon by the elites. \u201cIt\u2019s my mission,\u201d he said, \u201cto irritate the hell out of the eloquent who would oppress my people.\u201d \u201cHis people\u201d are the everyday people, the real people who they set themselves against the intellectual, the pompous, the fake. And so they vote for regional candidates who, from the cities, appear to be comical buffoons because they are buffoons who speak their language.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The heatwaves are not going to stop and the scientists are not going to change their minds</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The rise of the culture of resentment filled a gap left by the decline of traditional working-class culture, one that the working class could identify with and be proud of. The demise of Australia\u2019s working-class culture was due mainly to the decline of manufacturing, with global shifts in the division of labour. It was hastened by the Hawke-Keating government\u2019s industrial accords, which marginalised trade unions as activist organisations and eroded the political emotion on which the ALP was founded, solidarity. When Bob Hawke <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuMNJ-MyTWk\">sang</a> Solidarity Forever at the 2012 Australian Council of Trade Unions conference it was mere nostalgia, a wistful dirge for a time when the workers could be inspired by the sentiment.</p> <p>Without an effective trade union movement, the Labor party has lost its ballast. Yet the past clings on in the form of Anthony Albanese and the power of union bosses in the factions. When unionists \u201cbetray\u201d the party by supporting the conservatives, as mining and forestry workers have, aren\u2019t they only reflecting the society of self-interest that Labor governments as much as conservative ones created with their free market reforms?</p> <p>If Labor is to build a constituency based on socially and environmentally progressive ideas then it has to aim to win government not by splitting the difference between culturally backward-looking voters in regional Queensland and forward-looking voters in the cities, but by winning progressive voters in traditional Liberal party seats.</p> <p>That means no longer buying into the demonisation of the Greens, who are its natural allies in building a progressive future. After all, the Greens\u2019 platform shows stronger commitment to social justice than Labor\u2019s does, and Labor\u2019s climate change policy is now (at last) based on the science and therefore close to the Greens\u2019 one.</p> <h2>Yellow vests</h2> <p>Of course, the politics of the election were more complicated than I have presented them. But the argument I am making points to a profound underlying trend in Australian society. Identity politics among the young has been excoriated by commentators on the right; but identity politics is thriving in the bush. Just ask Barnaby Joyce.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"56d35b52f5c7c6c5fc94b05adf91926273167160\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56d35b52f5c7c6c5fc94b05adf91926273167160/0_0_4377_2906/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A stall holder hands his pineapple hat to Scott Morrison during a visit to Flemington markets in Sydney\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The yellow vest symbolises the common man; putting it on is a protest against his invisibility.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s no accident that the hi-vis jackets our political leaders donned at every campaign photo op are also the uniform of the <em>gilets jaunes</em> protesters in France.

The yellow vest symbolises the common man; putting it on is a protest against his invisibility.</p> <p>It was a movement sparked by rising fuel taxes among those who depend on their vehicles. They were not opposed to action on climate change as such but objected to having to be the ones to pay the price for it.

It reached its sharpest point in the election campaign when Bob Brown\u2019s convoy of Adani protesters arrived to a hostile reception in Clermont in north Queensland.</p> <p>This <em>was</em> the climate change election. The climate question had moved from the margins to the mainstream for the first time. It wasn\u2019t enough to push Labor over the line but, for a growing proportion of the electorate, perhaps now a third, and much higher among young people, it is the compelling issue that will not go away because the heatwaves are not going to stop and the scientists are not going to change their minds.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/10/populists-rise-progressives-radical-right\">Populists are on the rise but this can be a moment for progressives too | Chantal Mouffe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The historical forces are moving, and it would be foolish for the Labor party to pull back now.

Global warming was no longer a scientific and environmental issue but a cultural one. Prominent conservatives including Sarah Palin shifted from supporting action to cut emissions to denouncing global warming as a liberal plot.</p> <p>From a situation in which there was little difference between Republican and Democratic voters on the need to take action, within a few years of 2009 a wide gulf had opened up, to the point where in 2016 a man who dismissed climate science as a Chinese hoax was elected president. When Trump ridiculed climate change his people understood who the targets were \u2013 Al Gore, Hillary Clinton and the know-it-alls in the east coast cites.</p> <h2><strong>Metrophobia</strong></h2> <p>The conservatives who imported climate science denial to Australia saw their actions <a href=\"https://meanjin.com.au/blog/love-in-a-hot-climate-the-horrible-mess-of-climate-change-politics/\">explicitly</a> as part of their culture war. </p> <p>When climate change was sucked into the culture wars two worldviews faced each other uncomprehendingly.

      "bodyText": "This is the first piece in \u2018Next left: where to now for Australian progressives?\u2019, a new series on what the election result means for the progressive side of politics and the path forward Political commentators reflexively overinterpret election results. The story we\u2019ve been told is that the Coalition\u2019s win means that \u201cAustralian voters\u201d have rejected Labor\u2019s radical plan for reform of the tax-and-spend system, confirming that Australians prefer stability and incremental change. Yet if one in 50 (2%) had voted the other way the pundits would have junked this narrative and told us, with great authority, that by endorsing Labor\u2019s vision \u201cAustralian voters\u201d showed they\u2019re ready to embrace change. One in 50 could have switched to Labor if Clive Palmer had decided to spend his $60m on a new house instead of an election. Or if Labor had chosen a more credible leader. Or if, a week before election day, a minister had been outed cheating on his expenses. Yet such a random event would then have caused the pundits to offer a sharply different analysis of the state of Australian society. Poring over the seats won and lost, analysts have observed that many people voted against their economic interests, both at the lower end and the upper end. Some electorates dominated by low- and middle-income households, especially in the regions, voted conservative even though they would have gained from Labor\u2019s plan to rebalance the tax system to benefit low-income households. Many in the wealthiest electorates shifted to Labor even though their taxes would be higher. It\u2019s a phenomenon noted a few years ago in the US. Donald Trump promised huge tax cuts for the rich and no change to a desperately unfair health system, yet millions of Americans on the margins voted for him. Trump duly delivered on his promises and they still support him. Labor\u2019s inability to attract enough votes has been blamed on its unduly complicated message. Some say its marketing misfired. People were confused and so voted against their own interests. The answer is a simpler message marketed more effectively, and by a leader who is more relatable. And Labor must cut back on the promises of improving the tax-and-welfare system because voters could not understand it, or because they are prey to scare campaigns. In other words, they blame confusion for voters\u2019 irrational behaviour. But it\u2019s more plausible that those who vote against their economic interests are as rational as other voters; it\u2019s just that they don\u2019t behave according to the pundit\u2019s mental model \u2013 in which economic interests guide rational voting behaviour. For these citizens voting is less about economics than about culture. They are voting to protect a culture, that is, a social environment and way of life made up of values, behaviours and symbols that accord with their sense of who they are and where they fit. Those in wealthy suburbs who vote against their economic interests by supporting Labor or the Greens are also voting for culture; in their case, they want to change it. The argument that \u201cmoney doesn\u2019t buy happiness\u201d is typically attributed to the comfortable middle classes, but it can apply at the other end too. At the lower end, those who vote against their economic interests might be worse off under a conservative government, but they will feel better because of the psychic wages they receive from knowing their anxieties are being recognised and addressed. These psychic wages compensate for any decline in material living standards. Progressives often have trouble understanding that culture can trump economics and around the world they are losing elections because the power of culture is growing while they continue to speak the old language. Culture now matters more than class, which is a dilemma for progressives in the cities who support the class interests of low-income people in the regions but represent a culture that many in the regions resent. The state of culture The message of Donald Trump\u2019s slogan \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d was: \u201cYou\u2019re losing the world you know, the one that gives you a firm identity, and I will bring it back.\u201d In Australia, it\u2019s the same sentiment that the Coalition, with the help of shock jocks and conservative commentators, has been exploiting, not least with its attacks on political correctness and defence of \u201creligious freedom\u201d. In regional Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania, where Labor performed very badly, the culture many identify with is a nostalgic, inward-looking one resentful towards the cities. One Nation attracted the votes of this cohort and channelled them to the Liberal and National parties. It should be remembered that low-income electorates in the big cities still voted solidly for Labor. But over the last decades a new kind of voter has emerged, one driven by cultural anxiety, who no longer feels that Australia is the country he or she grew up in. And it\u2019s not. It\u2019s partly due to immigration, a situation created by John Howard as much as anyone else when he allowed a huge increase in the rate of migration, making parts of Australia\u2019s cities feel alien. Feeling like \u201ca stranger in my own country\u201d is perhaps stronger among those who look on from elsewhere rather than those living in it. When the New South Wales Labor leader Michael Daley was forced out of office for saying that \u201cour kids\u201d are fleeing Sydney and being replaced by Asian immigrants with PhDs, in many parts of Australia people felt he spoke to their anxieties \u2013 even those who can\u2019t stomach the race-baiting of Pauline Hanson. The most articulate spokesman for the alienated \u201cwhite working class\u201d is Mark Latham, who arguably foreshadowed the Trump model. Speaking after the election, on Sky After Dark, he bitterly denounced the inner-city lefty elites in defence of those who \u201chate the idea of a Plibersek, a Wong, a Keneally patronising and condescending and constantly inferring there\u2019s something wrong with working people and only these elites know how working people should run their lives\u201d. (Like One Nation, Latham has a woman problem.) Les Murray is their poet. Success heaped accolades and money on Murray but it could never wipe away the seething resentment he felt at being looked down upon by the elites. \u201cIt\u2019s my mission,\u201d he said, \u201cto irritate the hell out of the eloquent who would oppress my people.\u201d \u201cHis people\u201d are the everyday people, the real people who they set themselves against the intellectual, the pompous, the fake. And so they vote for regional candidates who, from the cities, appear to be comical buffoons because they are buffoons who speak their language. The rise of the culture of resentment filled a gap left by the decline of traditional working-class culture, one that the working class could identify with and be proud of. The demise of Australia\u2019s working-class culture was due mainly to the decline of manufacturing, with global shifts in the division of labour. It was hastened by the Hawke-Keating government\u2019s industrial accords, which marginalised trade unions as activist organisations and eroded the political emotion on which the ALP was founded, solidarity. When Bob Hawke sang Solidarity Forever at the 2012 Australian Council of Trade Unions conference it was mere nostalgia, a wistful dirge for a time when the workers could be inspired by the sentiment. Without an effective trade union movement, the Labor party has lost its ballast. Yet the past clings on in the form of Anthony Albanese and the power of union bosses in the factions. When unionists \u201cbetray\u201d the party by supporting the conservatives, as mining and forestry workers have, aren\u2019t they only reflecting the society of self-interest that Labor governments as much as conservative ones created with their free market reforms? If Labor is to build a constituency based on socially and environmentally progressive ideas then it has to aim to win government not by splitting the difference between culturally backward-looking voters in regional Queensland and forward-looking voters in the cities, but by winning progressive voters in traditional Liberal party seats. That means no longer buying into the demonisation of the Greens, who are its natural allies in building a progressive future. After all, the Greens\u2019 platform shows stronger commitment to social justice than Labor\u2019s does, and Labor\u2019s climate change policy is now (at last) based on the science and therefore close to the Greens\u2019 one. Yellow vests Of course, the politics of the election were more complicated than I have presented them. But the argument I am making points to a profound underlying trend in Australian society. Identity politics among the young has been excoriated by commentators on the right; but identity politics is thriving in the bush. Just ask Barnaby Joyce. It\u2019s no accident that the hi-vis jackets our political leaders donned at every campaign photo op are also the uniform of the gilets jaunes protesters in France. The gilets jaunes are raging against the wealthy cities and the smug elites that live in them. The yellow vest symbolises the common man; putting it on is a protest against his invisibility. It was a movement sparked by rising fuel taxes among those who depend on their vehicles. They were not opposed to action on climate change as such but objected to having to be the ones to pay the price for it. And they\u2019d been anxiously watching boats carrying Syrians and Africans arrive on Europe\u2019s shores. The gilets jaunes complain: \u201cWe no longer count in our own country.\u201d A movement with no platform and no leaders, it\u2019s a manifestation driven by resentment at the apparent complacency of those prosperous cities, and the rage is concentrated, as if by a magnifying glass, on Emmanuel Macron. In Australia too, the electoral power of culture is most intense in the struggle over how to respond to climate change. It reached its sharpest point in the election campaign when Bob Brown\u2019s convoy of Adani protesters arrived to a hostile reception in Clermont in north Queensland. This was the climate change election. The climate question had moved from the margins to the mainstream for the first time. It wasn\u2019t enough to push Labor over the line but, for a growing proportion of the electorate, perhaps now a third, and much higher among young people, it is the compelling issue that will not go away because the heatwaves are not going to stop and the scientists are not going to change their minds. The historical forces are moving, and it would be foolish for the Labor party to pull back now. In Britain, the House of Commons declared a climate emergency. In the US, Democratic party presidential contenders have transcended Barack Obama\u2019s cautious strategy and are lining up to announce strong climate policies. After all, in a land of climate science denial, which half of science do you ditch to find the middle ground? The conservatives turned climate change into a cultural battle. When the Tea Party emerged in 2009, it did not take long, backed by Fox News and the Koch brothers, before climate change was added to the toxic brew of sins attributed to \u201cthe liberal elite\u201d. Global warming was no longer a scientific and environmental issue but a cultural one. Prominent conservatives including Sarah Palin shifted from supporting action to cut emissions to denouncing global warming as a liberal plot. From a situation in which there was little difference between Republican and Democratic voters on the need to take action, within a few years of 2009 a wide gulf had opened up, to the point where in 2016 a man who dismissed climate science as a Chinese hoax was elected president. When Trump ridiculed climate change his people understood who the targets were \u2013 Al Gore, Hillary Clinton and the know-it-alls in the east coast cites. Metrophobia The conservatives who imported climate science denial to Australia saw their actions explicitly as part of their culture war. When climate change was sucked into the culture wars two worldviews faced each other uncomprehendingly. Those of an inward-looking and nativist disposition could argue that Australia shouldn\u2019t cut its emissions because it will make no difference to the world; those with an outward-looking temperament insist that we are global citizens as well as Australians and must accept our responsibilities. Conservative politicians in regional Australia have been stoking a kind of metrophobia, playing up resentments against \u201ccity elites\u201d and enlarging myths about latte-sipping sophisticates sneering at their backwardness. Environmentalists occupy the central place in this demonology. They refer not to \u201cthe Greens\u201d but to \u201cthe inner-city Greens\u201d. The demonisation of the Greens reached scandalous proportions in March when rightwing politicians and Murdoch commentators responded to the massacre of innocents by a neo-Nazi in Christchurch by denouncing \u201cextremists from the right and the left\u201d. There are no extremists of the left. To equate trespassing by animal rights activists to mass murder is grotesque and deeply offensive to the victims. Besides, animal rights activists are not environmentalists, as the conflicts over culling prove. The deniers who have taken over the Liberal and National parties are a radical fringe but they now dominate conservative politics. The moderates are afraid of them. Among the public, explicit denial of the science is the preoccupation of a small minority, perhaps 10%. But a larger portion shares the deniers\u2019 antipathy towards environmentalism, and nowhere more so than in regional Queensland and Tasmania, where Labor lost the election. On the surface, the Adani mine is about jobs, but beneath it the mine has become the foremost symbol of the cultural rift between the regions and the cities. The anti-Adani convoy brought this cultural conflict starkly into view. If it\u2019s not irrational to vote for culture over economics, it makes no sense to vote to protect a culture that is being overwhelmed by unstoppable natural forces. Climate activists of all kinds see the issue not so much as one of science (that\u2019s settled), nor of economics (we should make the transition whatever the cost) but of moral obligation. They identify themselves as standing for the survival of humankind and the natural world. They cannot allow the Adani mine to go ahead because it is the symbol of the end of the world. What\u2019s going to happen to us? The deniers have been returned to office, led by a man who gleefully rubbed a lump of coal in the faces of the opposition. The prime minister has handed responsibility for cutting Australia\u2019s emissions to Angus Taylor, a man who appears to reject climate science and the facts about Australia\u2019s problems in meeting its Paris targets. The appointment is a brazen two-finger salute to all those who take global warming science seriously. Then there is Matt Canavan. The minister for resources sees it as his duty to promote coal as vigorously as he can, including allocating public subsidies for the construction of new coal-fired power plants. Building new coal plants isn\u2019t about economics or good energy policy; all of the experts and all of the energy industry executives agree it\u2019s reckless. The banks won\u2019t go near it. Canavan has castigated industry for supporting a transition out of coal. For Canavan, Taylor and Morrison, building a new coal-fired power plant would be a decisive win in their war against environmentalism. Winning the culture war is much more important than their commitment to the free market. But they can only hold back the tide for so long.

Their feelings of dread are based on solid scientific facts, reinforced by experience each time a heatwave scorches the streets, autumn will not come, fire razes a forest that\u2019s not supposed to burn, and the Great Barrier Reef limps on to its final death. It\u2019s the future of politics in Australia. \u2022 Clive Hamilton is professor of public ethics at Charles Sturt University in Canberra",

      "bodyText": "Of all the bizarre sideshows on the 2019 federal election trail, the pantomime around electric cars had to be one of the strangest. Scott Morrison argued that Labor\u2019s plan for 50% electric vehicles by 2030 would \u201cruin the weekend\u201d and the Liberal party paid for Facebook ads claiming Labor would confiscate tradies\u2019 Hilux utes. Meanwhile, all the world\u2019s big car manufacturers are busy getting on with electrifying their model ranges. But while things are changing, buying an EV is still a big leap. Guardian Australia spoke to experts about the options. What kind of price tag am I looking at? The price tag is still the biggest deterrent. Mike Sinclair, the editor of carsales.com.au, says things are improving \u2013 there are several models below $50,000, but prices are likely to fall further over the next few years. \u201cJust by critical mass, the cost of the vehicles will moderate but they won\u2019t become cheap,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd there will be more choice, which will inevitably make the market a bit more competitive.\u201d There are about a dozen models of pure EVs on the market in Australia from manufacturers including Hyundai, Kia, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Mercedes-Benz, Renault and Tesla, priced from $46,000 to well over $100,000. Recharging at superfast charging stations takes less than 30 minutes, or they can be charged overnight at home. That\u2019s a big change from a decade ago when, in 2006, the Guardian\u2019s then editor Alan Rusbridger bought an electric car in the UK that resembled something that Noddy would drive through Toyland. It was made mostly of plastic, had a top speed of about 45km/h, a range of 48km, just enough room for two small adults and cost \u00a39,000 ($18,000). EVs are now fast and luxurious in comparison \u2013 they can seat a family comfortably and have ranges measured in hundreds of kilometres. But there are only about 6,000 on Australia\u2019s roads. Will EVs get cheaper? And when? In the absence of government policy aimed at boosting uptake (the election campaign demonstrated the Coalition isn\u2019t keen to go down that road), the number of EVs on the road will shift substantially only when they approach price parity \u2013 selling for the same price or cheaper than the combustion-engined equivalent. Bloomberg New Energy Finance is relatively bullish about how long that will take. In 2017, it forecast that the crossover point was in 2026. Its 2019 analysis has this happening in 2022. While its projections are optimistic, the International Energy Agency and oil companies such as BP are predicting this will take place before 2030. A Deloitte report released in January put the tipping point at 2024. The falling cost of batteries is driving that optimistic outlook. For many years, electric vehicle batteries were said to account for half the car\u2019s total cost, but that figure has dropped dramatically. In 2015, the battery represented about 57% of the cost, in 2019 it was 33% and by 2025 Bloomberg NEF predicts it will be only 20%. Should I buy now or wait? This depends largely on personal circumstances and the reality is that more than half of all Australians buy used cars, rather than new, so for them it\u2019s not yet an option.
