The plant is owned by the Japanese chemical company Denka, which purchased it from DuPont in 2015. Barber, the leader of the Poor People\u2019s Campaign movement and one of the high-profile voices in the Moral Mondays movement, described conditions in Reserve as \u201ctragic \u2026 immoral \u2026 evil\u201d in an article for the Guardian published earlier this month. You can watch a live stream of events here: The town hall in New Orleans, at the First Presbyterian church, will feature a roundtable discussion with Robert Taylor, president of the Concerned Citizens of St John; Wilma Subra, a chemist and technical adviser with Louisiana Environmental Action Network; Sharon Lavigne, director of Rise St James; Ruhan Nagra, executive director of the University Network for Human Rights; Larry Sorapuru, councilman-at-large for Saint John Parish; and the Rev Barber. Barber will travel to Saint John Parish on Saturday morning to visit residents of Reserve and observe the Denka plant up close.",

So when I did get a start I was keen to start putting the foot down and take the opportunity because that doesn\u2019t come along very often. It was nice to be able to cash in.\u201d</p> <p>The match was all-but decided in the first three overs of England\u2019s reply: the home side sinking to 12 for three as the openers, Danni Wyatt and Amy Jones, departed without scoring, looking to slog, while Tammy Beaumont then toed a catch to Alyssa Healy behind the stumps.</p> <p>A brave effort from the No 6, Lauren Winfield, selected for the first time this series, was followed by a 12-ball 25-run cameo from Laura Marsh; both came too late to make much difference to a day that had been all about Lanning.</p> <p>This was supposed to have been England\u2019s prime opportunity to turn the series on its head: on 14 previous occasions, they had never lost a match here where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/26/rowdy-england-fortress-the-perfect-venue-to-start-final-leg-of-womens-ashes\" title=\"\">the crowds are so partisan and raucous</a> that it has earned the moniker \u201cFortress Chelmsford\u201d.

From there, with Lanning entering the fray, it was all systems go: Anya Shrubsole hit out of the attack as her first over went for 16 runs, while the early switch to spin failed to stem the flow \u2013 Sophie Ecclestone punished for nearly 11 an over.</p> <p>Along the way Lanning was ably supported by Beth Mooney, who hit a 28-ball half-century, and Ash Gardner, who smashed the biggest six of the innings off a disgruntled Shrubsole.</p> <p>Some have questioned whether undergoing major shoulder surgery 18 months ago has stymied Lanning\u2019s international dominance.

      "bodyText": "In a show of utter dominance Australia ground England\u2019s hopes of drawing this Ashes series firmly into the dust, the visitors smashing their record T20 total while Meg Lanning racked up an unbeaten 133 from 63 balls to break her own record for the highest individual score in the format. England, by contrast, could manage just the same number of runs as Lanning as they fell to a 93-run defeat, their worst in T20. \u201cIt was a pretty sweet victory,\u201d Lanning said. \u201cWe came here to win the Ashes outright and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done.\u201d \u201cI hit the ball as well I have for a long time,\u201d she added. \u201cI was getting some starts but getting out all the time \u2013 that was annoying me. So when I did get a start I was keen to start putting the foot down and take the opportunity because that doesn\u2019t come along very often. It was nice to be able to cash in.\u201d The match was all-but decided in the first three overs of England\u2019s reply: the home side sinking to 12 for three as the openers, Danni Wyatt and Amy Jones, departed without scoring, looking to slog, while Tammy Beaumont then toed a catch to Alyssa Healy behind the stumps. A brave effort from the No 6, Lauren Winfield, selected for the first time this series, was followed by a 12-ball 25-run cameo from Laura Marsh; both came too late to make much difference to a day that had been all about Lanning. This was supposed to have been England\u2019s prime opportunity to turn the series on its head: on 14 previous occasions, they had never lost a match here where the crowds are so partisan and raucous that it has earned the moniker \u201cFortress Chelmsford\u201d. This time the sell-out crowd sounded anything but, sinking into themselves as they searched in vain for something to cheer. Kate Cross\u2019s first over, with Healy skying the fifth ball of the innings to Nat Sciver at midwicket, was as good as it got for the home crowd. From there, with Lanning entering the fray, it was all systems go: Anya Shrubsole hit out of the attack as her first over went for 16 runs, while the early switch to spin failed to stem the flow \u2013 Sophie Ecclestone punished for nearly 11 an over. Along the way Lanning was ably supported by Beth Mooney, who hit a 28-ball half-century, and Ash Gardner, who smashed the biggest six of the innings off a disgruntled Shrubsole. Some have questioned whether undergoing major shoulder surgery 18 months ago has stymied Lanning\u2019s international dominance. This performance showed that she is back with a vengeance, the Australian captain smashing seven sixes with such ease that one feels her shoulder surgeon should use the videotape of this innings to advertise his services to future clients. Lanning\u2019s half-century took 24 balls to acquire: 27 balls later came the three-figure milestone, brought up in style with yet another six smashed over deep square-leg. As any statistician will tell you, numbers have to be contextualised. Lanning\u2019s previous T20 century had been against Ireland, ranked 10th: perhaps the most astonishing thing about Friday\u2019s display was that it was against a side who, after reaching the final of the World T20 eight months ago, can lay claim to being the second-best T20 team in the world. They did not look it: even Wyatt, England\u2019s best fielder, was gifting boundaries in the deep, while Beaumont made the fatal error of dropping Lanning at point, a mistake that cost 48 runs. \u201cWe haven\u2019t played anywhere near our potential,\u201d Heather Knight, the England captain, said. \u201cThe girls are disappointed, it\u2019s been a tricky few weeks for us \u2013 we\u2019ve lost a bit of belief and confidence.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get back to the way we know we can play.

      "bodyText": "My favourite photo of my friend John is the one I took just after smearing a lipstick kiss on his cheek. In it, he has turned to the camera, toothy grin exposed and eyes wild, caught out in surprise. John died in 2012. He had skin cancer that went into remission but later metastasised and came back in his brain, eight tumours at once. He was 25. April 24 was the seventh anniversary of his death. For the first few years, my friends and I held events to mark the date. We floated paper cranes into Canberra\u2019s Lake Burley Griffin or assembled in houses where we Blu-tacked photos of him on to the wall behind the drinks table, mingling awkwardly.

In a wide-ranging interview, Marape outlined a vision for his country, to leave behind a history of wasted opportunities and squandered resources, and move towards a healthy and educated nation free of violence. In May, after Scott Morrison led the Coalition to an election victory , Pacific leaders urged him to do more on climate change, saying Australia was \u201clagging behind\u201d. Marape, who is completing his first official visit to Australia this week, said he would \u201cnot be silenced\u201d on environmental responsibility. \u201cWe can have our resources but we must have it in an environmentally-friendly manner, so that we leave planet earth to the next generation not in the form we\u2019ve inherited but a better form.

He said he and Morrison had negotiated Australia\u2019s assistance in improving health care. PNG also continues to have some of the world\u2019s worst rates of family and sexual violence, and last week 18 people were massacred in the highlands village of Karida. The murders of mainly women and children were an escalation of worsening tribal violence which shocked the country. Marape denied there was a cultural tolerance of violence in PNG, warningperpetrators they would face prosecution, and said revenge attacks and traditional systems of compensation as a response to violence had to end. \u201cI\u2019ve made it absolutely clear on every occasion I\u2019m asked this question, that whether it\u2019s domestic violence or violence generally in society, culture and custom will not be a place to hide,\u201d he said. PNG police have historically been underresourced, with investigative officers and specialised family violence units effectively grounded because they can\u2019t pay for petrol to attend a crime.

The newly-formed Centre for Public Integrity has brought together a powerful collection of former judges, lawyers, and integrity experts to push for a strong federal anti-corruption body, champion donations and lobbying reform, and protect Australia\u2019s various accountability institutions, including the media. In an interview with Guardian Australia, the centre\u2019s chair, former New South Wales court of appeal judge Anthony Whealy, said one of its chief concerns was preventing the restriction of public interest journalism in the name of national security. The freedoms of whistleblowers and the media have come under attack in a series of recent prosecutions \u2013 including of Witness K, Bernard Collaery, Richard Boyle and David McBride \u2013 and through police raids on the ABC and the Canberra home of News Corp reporter Annika Smethurst. Whealy said he had never seen such a concerted pursuit of whistleblowers and journalists in Australia. He also feared national security would be used to justify mounting prosecutions in secret \u2013 a prospect he said would offend principles of open justice and discourage public interest reporting. \u201cJust as we see with the Bernard Collaery and Witness K trial, where national security is being raised as a reason for shrouding the proceedings in secrecy, I would suspect that if any proceedings are brought against the ABC and Annika Smethurst, that they would then be subject of national security orders to try and stop any proceedings in the public arena,\u201d Whealy said. \u201cFirst of all that would offend the principle of open justice. It would also be unfairly using a label \u2013 \u2018national security\u2019 \u2013 to stifle public information with a view to deterring whistleblowers and journalists from coming forward again.\u201d Australia\u2019s approach to whistleblowing is at odds with other western democracies. The United States, for example, rewards whistleblowers for coming forward. Labor promised a whistleblower rewards scheme if elected, a proposal the Coalition labelled \u201cwacky\u201d. Instead, Australia prosecutes whistleblowers such as Richard Boyle, the tax office employee who revealed aggressive approaches to debt collection that were driving small business owners to the brink. Whealy said the legal protections had failed to adjust to shifting community perceptions of whistleblowers. \u201cThe public feeling is very different now.

Sports Direct says it will enter into a mediation process with the tax authorities and it is \u201cless than probable\u201d that it will have to pay penalties.</p> <h2>House of Fraser</h2> <p>The state of House of Fraser, bought out of administration in August, is laid bare. Ashley expresses regret about buying the business and warns that some of the chain\u2019s problems are \u201cnothing short of terminal in nature\u201d. There is a warning that some of the group\u2019s 54 stores may have to close, as Ashley praises landlords and local authorities for their efforts in trying to save branches. He adds: \u201cWe do believe there could be a bright future for House of Fraser\u201d but then admits that his decision might have been different with hindsight. \u201cIf we had the gift of hindsight, we might have made a different decision in August 2018.\u201d</p> <h2>Debenhams</h2> <p>The statement explains at length the disappointment that a 29.9% stake in Debenhams was wiped out this year by the store <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/09/debenhams-is-taken-over-by-lenders-mike-ashley-loses-sta\">collapsing into administration in April</a>.

However, the big four accounting firms do not appear likely to take on Sports Direct\u2019s work soon. The statement says: Deloitte is conflicted because it does the company\u2019s tax compliance and advisory work; KPMG also believes it has conflicts of interest; EY has \u201csome reluctance\u201d because it ran the administration of House of Fraser; PwC has a \u201creluctance to engage\u201d because of Sports Direct\u2019s ownership structure.</p> <h2>UK retail</h2> <p>Ashley\u2019s statement warns that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/25/uk-retailers-record-longest-period-of-falling-sales-in-eight-years\">overall retail industry is in \u201cdire straits\u201d</a> and cautions that company voluntary arrangements \u2013 a cost-cutting procedure \u2013 are being used as \u201ccarte blanche\u201d to penalise creditors and landlords, while leaving healthy retailers at a disadvantage. \u201cThe more successful retailers [are] subsidising the rotten ones,\u201d he says.</p> <h2>Regulators</h2> <p>Ashley argues that financial advisers are not regulated properly, particularly those that operate in the field of company restructurings. Advisers should be \u201cnamed and shamed\u201d for implementing strategies that wipe out stakeholders. He then urges the Financial Conduct Authority, the City watchdog, to offer voluntary drug tests for the CEOs and CFOs of listed companies in case they are blackmailed and make bad decisions. \u201cHaving such undisclosed personal issues could lead to blackmail and force CEOs and CFOs to make decisions based on saving their own skin and potentially reducing shareholder value,\u201d he says.</p> <h2>Overall outlook for the group</h2> <p>The state of House of Fraser makes it impossible to forecast profitability, Ashley adds. \u201cOur acquisition of House of Fraser \u2026 has led to significant uncertainty as to the future profitability of the group as a whole, albeit not impacting the going concern assessment of the group.\u201d The statement is also gloomy about the core Sports Direct business, revealing that underlying profits slipped by 4.7% to \u00a3264.7m. With so many variables at play, the company says it will not be issuing any profit guidance for next year, but some guidance may be issued with the company\u2019s half-year results.</p>",

      "bodyText": "If they have not already managed to evade a police dragnet, Bryer Schmegelsky, 18, and Kam McLeod, 19, are believed to be stumbling around the unforgiving terrain that surrounds the remote Canadian town of Gillam. Police believe the two fugitives are still close to the sprawling settlement of about 1,300 residents dotted across 2,000 square km. They are not thought to have a vehicle, and there is only one road in and out of town. \u201cOur last confirmed sighting is in Gillam area, so that\u2019s where we are now,\u201d said Julie Courchaine, a spokeswoman for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on Friday afternoon. So Schmegelsky, 18, and McLeod, 19, are mostly probably stumbling through the wilds around the northern Manitoba town, amid swampland and thick forests of prickly black spruces and dense tamarack. In the region\u2019s brief summer, sandflies and other biting insects make the most of the warmth by exploding in population and feeding on black bears, wolves and humans. \u201cIf they are wandering around in the bush, they couldn\u2019t have picked a worse time,\u201d the deputy mayor of Gillam, John McDonald, told the Canadian Press. Courchaine said it was possible the pair had changed their appearance and somehow made their way out of the area, but for now the focus of the manhunt is more than 2,000km from the roadside in British Columbia where the odyssey began in a spasm of violence that ended three lives. Schmegelsky and McLeod were this week charged in absentia with one count of second-degree murder in the case of Leonard Dyck, 64, a botanist who taught at the University of British Columbia. They are also suspects in the double murder of Lucas Fowler, 23, an Australian living in British Columbia, and US citizen Chynna Deese, 24, who flew out from her home in North Carolina to join him on a road trip to Alaska in a powder-blue van. Fowler and Deese had met in Croatia in 2017. Two years later, their romance turned into the \u201cworst ever love story\u201d, in the words of Fowler\u2019s father, when they were found shot dead on a remote Canadian highway. Days later, Schmegelsky and McLeod were named as suspects in that crime, and a hunt was launched across the northern reaches of Canada\u2019s prairie provinces. Eventually, the burned-out remains of a car the pair had taken were found near the Bird reserve on Fox Lake Cree nation, three provinces away. The RCMP descended on the nearby town of Gillam, bringing tracker dogs and hi-tech equipment to aid in their search. The manhunt has attracted attention from across the English-speaking world. The scale and duration of the search is thought unparalleled in Canada\u2019s recent history \u2013 which might go some way to explaining the intense interest in this case. Then there is the fact that the suspects and their victims are all white. No such manhunt has ever been launched after the murder or disappearance of dozens of Indigenous women along British Columbia\u2019s infamous Highway of Tears, which is located about 1,000km away. It\u2019s a long way from where the two childhood friends set off: Port Alberni, British Columbia, a city of about 18,000 on Vancouver Island. Like many small British Columbia towns, Port Alberni runs on resource extraction \u2013 in this case, forestry \u2013 an industry whose stability has declined dramatically since the 1980s. Several years ago the town was named Canada\u2019s worst place to live, a ranking based on a range of factors including high crime rates, high unemployment and poor weather. Port Alberni is the kind of place that many leave, and after saving up money by working at the local Walmart, Schmegelsky and McLeod did just that. According to Schmegelsky\u2019s father, he didn\u2019t have a licence, so when they left town on 12 July, McLeod was probably driving the red and grey pickup that would be found burned out just south of the town of Dease Lake, some days later. Some parts of their route are known: they would have had to take a ferry to leave the island, for instance. But other things make little sense. According to Schmegelsky\u2019s grandmother Carol Starkey, they were heading to Whitehorse, the Yukon capital, where two young men would not have much trouble finding work. Starkey told a Vancouver Island newspaper that she received a call from her grandson a few days after they left, saying the pair had reached Whitehorse but would be leaving again. Driving straight, with good conditions, the route would have taken at least a full 24 hours on the road. It remains unclear why \u2013 or if \u2013 they reached Whitehorse only to turn around almost immediately and head 650km to Liard River Hot Springs provincial park, where Fowler and Deese were believed to have been killed on July 14 or 15.

The newspaper also reported that Schmegelsky had sent photographs of Nazi paraphernalia to an online friend and espoused far-right views. On Wednesday, Alan Schmegelsky gave an interview to the Canadian Press in which he said he thought his son was making a last stand. McLeod\u2019s family has refrained from making many statements, saying through a local reporter on Wednesday that they are trying to understand what happened and still hoping McLeod will \u201ccome home to us safely so we can all get to the bottom of this story\u201d.

The points scoreline across all formats is 2-10 Australia\u2019s way, meaning England can only close the gap to 6-10 at best. And that looks unlikely given the gulf between the teams tonight. England were shellshocked from the second over, when Beth Mooney went after them with four boundaries in no time. Lanning very quickly matched her, then passed her, and while Mooney fell for a fifty, Lanning powered on to the biggest hundred in this format of the women\u2019s game. <br></p> <p>Australia\u2019s biggest ever score was never a realistic chance for England to chase, and predictably they lost early wickets trying to hit out. From then, even the slight chance was gone. England have been exposed in all three formats now in this series, and there will be reviews, recriminations and restructures once this series is done. <br></p> <p>Records and jubilation for the Australians though. Oh, they\u2019re having fun. All that firepower does make you wonder if they couldn\u2019t have given that Test match a better shake, though...

Welcome to sunny Essex, home of a lot of things that I don\u2019t know about because I\u2019m not from Essex.

These have a bit more riding on them than you might expect after England got pantsed in the 50-over games and was nowhere near the mark in the Test match. But by virtue of escaping with a draw, they can still tie this series on points 8-8.</p> <p>Three T20 games, 2 points each, and a 2-8 scoreline at present.</p> <p>They need a clean sweep. Australia meanwhile gave up a lead in the last series to tie it 8-8 and they <em>do not want to do that again.</em> So both teams are going to come out today desperate to win. Should be fun.<br></p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it, there\u2019ll be no party-spoiling draws of the series this year. The points scoreline across all formats is 2-10 Australia\u2019s way, meaning England can only close the gap to 6-10 at best. And that looks unlikely given the gulf between the teams tonight. England were shellshocked from the second over, when Beth Mooney went after them with four boundaries in no time. Lanning very quickly matched her, then passed her, and while Mooney fell for a fifty, Lanning powered on to the biggest hundred in this format of the women\u2019s game. Australia\u2019s biggest ever score was never a realistic chance for England to chase, and predictably they lost early wickets trying to hit out. From then, even the slight chance was gone. England have been exposed in all three formats now in this series, and there will be reviews, recriminations and restructures once this series is done. Records and jubilation for the Australians though. Oh, they\u2019re having fun. All that firepower does make you wonder if they couldn\u2019t have given that Test match a better shake, though... For now, they\u2019re bringing their Harlem Globetrotters show to Hove on Sunday to do more unspeakable things to England. We\u2019ll be there. 20th over: England 133-9 (Brunt 29, Cross 0) Kate Cross is nowhere near the last ball, wide outside off. A dot to finish, and England avoid being bowled out, but that\u2019s about all they can take out of tonight. Marsh gone, but she took a bit of paint off Schutt before she went! Twice she goes huge over the leg side, heaving the fuller balls away. Nice contact, the first goes into the crowd, the second is fingertipped over by Gardner. But that\u2019s where it ends, Marsh stepping across to try to lap over fine leg, and gloving the ball down onto her stumps. 19th over: England 117-8 (Brunt 29, Marsh 9) Brunt drives a couple on the loft, Marsh drives four out through cover. Still a healthy response from the crowd to each boundary. 18th over: England 108-8 (Brunt 26, Marsh 3) Last rites. Marsh gets a couple to cover, then a single to keep strike. She got a good piece of the pull shot, Ecclestone. Sounds good off the bat, soars a long way. But the boundary is long, and Gardner is tucked right inside the boundary line\u2019s pocket. Catch-o. 17th over: England 104-7 (Brunt 25, Ecclestone 2) Australia staying on spin. Brunt sweeps a couple from Molineux, then they work singles. The hundred is up, but they\u2019re going to lose by over a hundred tonight. Good grief. 16th over: England 99-7 (Brunt 21, Ecclestone 1) Two singles from the over. Previous wicket post, for reference. I don\u2019t want no Shrubs. A Shrub is a girl can\u2019t get no runs off me. Walking cross to the off side to a ball that slides, time to holler at the (umpire). 15th over: England 97-6 (Brunt 18) Last ball of the over again! Winfield gets a ball on leg stump, tries to flip it over fine leg like Mooney did, but fine leg is back. Wareham takes the comfy catch. Three singles and a wicket from Schutt\u2019s over, giving nothing away as she so often does. 14th over: England 94-5 (Winfield 32, Brunt 18) Well, at least Lauren Winfield is having some fun out there. She\u2019s been left out of the games so far, but nails a couple more boundaries on the sweep against Molineux. 13th over: England 81-5 (Winfield 23, Brunt 16) \u201cCatch that!\u201d Alyssa Healy keeps saying, but it keeps not being caught. Winfield slices a couple of shots away behind point and lands them safely for two. Then chips out in front of deep midwicket but pitches there too. Brunt dances at Kimmince and drives four through cover. Got it. They get 10, though the required rate is 21. 12th over: England 71-5 (Winfield 18, Brunt 11) Katherine Brunt out there, powerful bowler and powerful striker. Loves to bat. Uses her feet to get back to Wareham and pull a couple, then pound four over midwicket. Then jumps the other way to open up the off side and slap four through point. Quality batting. 11th over: England 58-5 (Winfield 16) Oh dear again. A soft catch. Trying to turn to leg last ball of a quiet over, and Sciver gets the leading edge back to Australia\u2019s off-spinner. Plopped into her hands. Donk. \u201cA steep ol\u2019 fall,\u201d writes Matthew Dony with exquisite timing. \u201cI just had to go back and check the dates. Surely the West Indies series was, like, 18 months or so ago. It can\u2019t possibly have been last month. Can\u2019t have been.\u201d 10th over: England 54-4 (Sciver 26, Winfield 14) Sciver hits Kimmince lightly enough to leg that they\u2019re able to get back for two. Rotates strike, and Winfield skips down to drive beautifully between mid-off and cover, splitting them for four. Nine from the over again. Just the... 173 from 60 balls to get. 9th over: England 45-4 (Sciver 22, Winfield 9) Georgia Wareham\u2019s leg-breaks now, and Winfield comes down to pop one over mid-on for four. Assorted singles, nine from the over, and it would normally be a good one but it leaves England needing 17 per over from here. If you\u2019re English and need cheering up, here\u2019s something nice from the boundary line. 8th over: England 36-4 (Sciver 19, Winfield 3) Australia electric on the rope, twice saving what would have been Sciver boundaries. Once flicking Molineux down to fine leg, once advancing to clear mid-off. Sciver is doing her best but she\u2019s a lone hand waving amongst empty waves. 7th over: England 30-4 (Sciver 14, Winfield 2) Delissa Kimmince on to bowl. She has two weapons: accuracy and changes of pace. Really hard to get her away with all her slower balls. Dot balls coming up, several in a row, and that brings the pressure to swing. Winfield tries, and skews the ball high and straight. Mooney has a long way to get around from mid-on and has to dive backwards at the last second. Gets hands to it but can only parry it in front to save runs, but not take the catch. England need 15 an over. 6th over: England 30-3 (Sciver 13, Winfield 1) Lauren Winfield at six, the former opener. Sciver tries to shake off the run out by pulling another boundary. About 30 more of those and England might be back in it. Calamity to calamity. Sciver whips a boundary from Jonassen, but then tries a single to midwicket, hit hard enough for Mooney to steady, aim, and fire to Healy who whips the striker\u2019s bails off. 5th over: England 18-3 (Knight 3, Sciver 4) Australia are absolutely buzzing. Twice the English bats drive straight and would expect to get through for four, but twice there\u2019s a big dive that stops the ball in the ring. Perry should have Knight lbw, hit on the back leg, but the umpire says no for height. Incorrect call. Then Perry draws the edge, and Lanning nearly pulls off a blinder at slip, diving to her right and an inch off the turf. 4th over: England 14-3 (Knight 1, Sciver 2) Schutt continues being unplayable. Two singles from the over. Simon McMahon emails in. \u201cEngland\u2019s decision to have a bowl looking about as good as Nasser\u2019s at Brisbane in 2002.\u201d Poor old Nasser. I\u2019ve argued this before, but... if he\u2019d batted then they would have got smashed as well, but no one would have blamed the toss. Confirmation bias, y\u2019all. 3rd over: England 12-3 (Knight 0, Sciver 1) Needing about 13 an over to win, I\u2019m going out on a limb to say England won\u2019t be winning this one. Hoo boy. When it\u2019s not going your way, it\u2019s going somewhere else. Tammy Beaumont, who has just clipped a beautiful boundary from a no-ball, then failed to score off the free hit. She gets a ball that would be a wide if she left it. But needing this many runs she\u2019s not in a headspace to leave anything. Has a go, and it nicks the outer edge of the toe end of her bat through to the keeper. 2nd over: England 6-2 (Beaumont 0) Last ball of the over, and this time it\u2019s Jones for a duck. Beaumont came in and picked up a couple, Jones got a leg bye, then tries to belt the last ball over mid-on and fails. Megan Schutt the bowler, and she was swerving it through the air like The Fast and the Furious. 1st over: England 1-1 (Jones 0, Beaumont 0) One extra from the first over and they\u2019re chasing 227. Nuff said. It was always a big chance. England had to come out swinging, but Perry did as well. Utterly hooping the ball away from Wyatt. She couldn\u2019t lay bat on three, then the only run of the innings came from one that swung so much it became a wide. So eventually Wyatt just has a huge hoick, big outside edge, and Gardner at deep third runs it to dive and catch. A bit of correspondence from readers: Villani is in the T20 squad Ravi, she just wasn\u2019t around earlier while she was with Australia A. The Sixers women\u2019s team have the highest score in either men\u2019s or women\u2019s Big Bash, so this is well above standard I reckon Sarah. Nice to hear from you. And an email from Ben Foster: \u201cSophie Ecclestone should probably be a bit lower-key in her celebrations when she bowls someone hoicking to cow when the score is 200 after 18 overs.\u201d Can\u2019t argue. TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX. Yeeeeeesh. A couple of years ago Danni Wyatt made a brilliant ton and England chased about 170 in Canberra. That win seemed stunning at the time. They\u2019ll need something truly meteoric to come back tonight. Heather Knight won the toss, elected to chase, and then conceded Australia\u2019s highest ever score in this format, as well as the highest individual score. Meg Lanning has had enough of mucking about for 40s and 50s, and did something about it. That was exhilarating. 11.3 runs per over across the innings. If you\u2019re wondering about the bowling figures, it\u2019s best not to ask. Kate Cross the most economical at 9.33 and a wicket across her three overs. Shrubsole 50 runs from three. Marsh 36 from three, Brunt 40 from four. Ecclestone again tried with 2 for 42 from four, with a few near misses.  Carnage!  20th over: Australia 226-3 (Lanning 133, Perry 7) Katherine Brunt to be the last fowl in this shooting gallery. Perry takes a single. Brunt bowls a sloppy full toss. Lanning wallops it over cover for four, and... Meg Lanning has the highest score in Women\u2019s T20 Internationals! A couple of players (including her) had made 126 before, but now she\u2019s left that in the dust. She mis-hits her next ball over point but it lands short of the sweeper. Perry slaps four through deep third, then takes a run. Lanning has one last shot, a slower ball cutter from Brunt, heaved across the line to square leg, and sharp running from Perry lets Lanning finish on 133 unbeaten. 19th over: Australia 212-3 (Lanning 125, Perry 1) Sciver unexpectedly quietens things. First Lanning middles one straight to short fine. Then leaves a very wide ball that is just inside the tram tracks and not a wide. Then absolutely nails a cover drive, but only a single to the sweeper. What a waste. Speaking of, Perry creams a straight hit, but it demolishes the non-striker\u2019s stumps. She follows up with a single square. Two runs from five balls in the penultimate over? Can she finish it off? Um. No. (Hint: it involves, Lanning, long-off, and six.) 18th over: Australia 204-3 (Lanning 118) Got one, but too little too late. Gardner has already belted two boundaries from the over by the time she misses one. Tries to go across the line when she would have been safer hitting straight, as Ecclestone darts one through last ball of the over. Perry will come in next. Interesting. 17th over: Australia 194-2 (Lanning 117, Gardner 18) A couple of cuts are saved by Wyatt diving at backward point, but in between times Lanning lifts a huge hit over midwicket for six! She is absolutely flying tonight! We haven\u2019t seen her at her best since her shoulder injury, but this is it. Unleashed by the format, she\u2019s flown all night. Deandra Dottin and Danni Wyatt were the only players with two T20 centuries in women\u2019s cricket. Now Lanning joins them. It\u2019s the fourth-fastest ever, and the fastest by an Australian. Lanning isn\u2019t done though. A filthy full toss lets her flick through fine leg. A ball pitched up lets her drive through mid-on, square of the close fielder but straight of the sweeper. All class. And the last ball is brutal, clubbed straight, nearly taking out the cameraman up on the gantry. Monster hit. This is some performance. 16th over: Australia 174-2 (Lanning 97, Gardner 18) Lanning nudges Sciver for a single, then it\u2019s the Ash Gardner show. Belts back for a second run after nudging square. Pulls a four viciously. Then lifts a lofted drive for six! This is incredible stuff from Australia. 15th over: Australia 161-2 (Lanning 96, Gardner 6) She can\u2019t quite get the fastest T20I hundred, Lanning, but she can get one of the top few. Could be on track for the biggest score too, it\u2019s 126. She nails another cut from Brunt for four, then gets a glove on one down the leg side to deflect that to fine leg. 14th over: Australia 150-2 (Lanning 87, Gardner 5) Kate Cross to bowl, and nearly has Lanning caught at backward point. Did that carry to Beaumont or bounce just in front? I didn\u2019t entirely catch it. Either way, it\u2019s hit the ground at some point, and that\u2019s what matters to the umpire. Gardner finishes the over with a fat edge for four. Just so you don\u2019t think that we\u2019ve seen tonight is normal, Beth Mooney\u2019s 50 was the 15th fastest in this format, and Meg Lanning\u2019s was equal 6th. 13th over: Australia 143-2 (Lanning 85, Gardner 0) Oh, dear. Did Danni Wyatt hit her head tonight? A second shocker in the outfield concedes a boundary, even less explicable than the last. Wyatt just got down to stop Lanning\u2019s hard sweep, then let it bounce off her body and over the rope. Gardner has been promoted in the order. Didn\u2019t England need that. Mooney advances, looks to loft over mid-on, but there\u2019s extra bounce and she hits it high to mid-off. Winfield steadies to take a good catch. 12th over: Australia 136-1 (Mooney 53, Lanning 79) What did I say about a softer ball? Laura Marsh has got to go, decides Lanning. A full toss to start the over helps, belted over midwicket for six. A half-volley follows, and instead of going straight Lanning plays a similar shot for six more! Marsh drags down, of course she does, and Lanning dips to nail the pull shot for four! And after a couple of singles, Marsh is so worried about Lanning that she bowls short again, and a carbon copy shot follows. The over costs 22, and the run rate is over 11. 11th over: Australia 114-1 (Mooney 52, Lanning 58) The ball maybe getting softer, because it\u2019s not quite pinging off the bat like it has been. Sciver is bowling her mediums and there\u2019s a stumping review as Lanning is beaten, and nearly dragged her foot out while looking for a run before realising that Jones had taken the ball behind the stumps. Jones takes the bails but Lanning\u2019s awareness was good enough to keep her toe back with some serious circus stretching despite her weight falling forward. Finally Lanning does find the fence, timing her cut shot perfectly after previously mistiming a similar shot for one. 10th over: Australia 106-1 (Mooney 47, Lanning 50) I guess they\u2019ve blown up. The run rate down to 10.6 per over as Laura Marsh bowls a set of off-breaks conceding five singles. 9th over: Australia 101-1 (Mooney 47, Lanning 50) Clearly Dennis Hopper has had a hand in this. \u201cOnce the team goes above 11 an over, the bomb is armed. If it drops below 11 an over...\u201d Shrubsole bowls, what would ordinarily be a good ball just outside the off stump, but Lanning opens the face and deflects it from a very deliberate nick through third for four! Then swings harder at the next ball, driving square for four more. Takes a single, then Mooney gets a dross toss and slaps it away through backward point for another boundary. Jeepers. The ton is up in nine overs. 8th over: Australia 87-1 (Mooney 42, Lanning 41) I don\u2019t want to take credit for this, but Meg Lanning did give me an icy and deeply unimpressed stare after the Taunton Test when I said in the press conference that it had been a drab and boring finish. And now she\u2019s walked in here today singing \u2018Let Me Entertain You.\u2019 Ok, I do want to take credit. This is all me. Laura Marsh has a go, and Lanning skips down again to drive her through cover for four! Lanning 41 off 21 at the end of the over, Mooney 42 off 22. 7th over: Australia 78-1 (Mooney 40, Lanning 31) The runs aren\u2019t flowing, they\u2019re pouring! Lanning punches four behind point, then rotates strike. Cross dishes up a half-volley next up, and Mooney swings sweetly through the line of that and lifts it over long-on for six. Lanning\u2019s six was a bit dinky, not quite timed, but Mooney\u2019s takes off. She follows it up by going off-side, threading the gap between cover in the circle and the deep sweeper to find another four! Make that 11 an over. 6th over: Australia 62-1 (Mooney 29, Lanning 29) Sorry Soph, but Lanning has come to play. Ecclestone bowled wonderfully well with a sore shoulder in the Test match and she\u2019s one of the brightest talents in the world, but she\u2019s being belted today. Lanning on the march, first driving four over cover, then lifting six over long on, before sweeping four though square. Ouch, ouch, ouch. They\u2019re going at 10 an over! 5th over: Australia 48-1 Mooney 29, Lanning 15) Mooney! She\u2019s so good when she\u2019s in form like this. Steps across her stumps does the left-hander, and picks up Brunt\u2019s ball from a leg stump line to flip-pull it over short fine leg. One bounce over the rope! That was some serious timing. Gorgeous. That\u2019s the first ball. After a few singles, she bookends the over with a square drive for four behind point. This is some strokemaking. 4th over: Australia 38-1 (Mooney 20, Lanning 14) The early wicket was what they wanted, but it hasn\u2019t slowed Australia. And England\u2019s fielding isn\u2019t helping. First Beaumont at backward point misreads the spin from Lanning\u2019s cut, allowing a single. Then Wyatt at deep cover makes a real hash of one, sprinting around to cut off Lanning\u2019s cut shot, but running too far and then losing her feet completely as she tries to slam on the brakes. It gets through for four, then Lanning cuts the last ball and gets a thick top edge for four more! Ecclestone has bowled a good over of left-arm spin there and it\u2019s gone for 11 runs. 3rd over: Australia 27-1 (Mooney 18, Lanning 5) Brunt manages to get things under control, tightening up until the final ball when she bowls on the pads and Lanning glances four. Sighs (and possibly stronger responses) erupt. 2nd over: Australia 21-1 (Mooney 17, Lanning 0) Jeepers. Beth Mooney has come to play. A few internet issues here, apologies, we\u2019ve been held up a minute. But Mooney hasn\u2019t. Pulls out the full bag of tricks. Bang goes the cut behind point. Then classier with the midwicket clip, then the on-drive. She\u2019s got all the shots, and proves it by nicking four to deep third. It\u2019s a scoring area in this format. Four boundaries in the over! 1st over: Australia 5-1 (Mooney 1, Lanning 0) Healy gone fifth ball of the over after whacking a four, and England have the early running. Early breakthrough! Huge for England, Healy is so dangerous off the top of a T20. She goes for a big one, gets a top edge, and Sciver is able to make excellent ground up in the circle and take the catch tumbling back. I\u2019ve got the XIs for you now. Australia going first. Perry gets a promotion from the World T20 setup, and Gardner is up the order after batting in the tail in the Test. Australia bat deep today with Kimmince all the way down at 10. Australia Healy Mooney Lanning Perry Gardner Haynes Molineux Jonassen Wareham Kimmince Schutt I have no idea how England will line up, because they have four openers and the team sheet they\u2019ve given us is helpfully filled out with 1 to 11 down the page, not by actual batting order. Unless Kate Cross is suddenly a first drop and Sophie Ecclestone second. Think not. Will Beaumont and Winfield come in down at 5 or 6, or has Wyatt\u2019s successful run at the top come to an end? England Jones Wyatt Beaumont Winfield Knight Sciver Brunt Marsh Ecclestone Shrubsole Cross The decision is Heather Knight\u2019s. They\u2019ll bowl first. Interesting given Australia\u2019s batting depth. I would have thought putting pressure on them under lights might be the go. But in this format, sides do like knowing what the pitch is doing and what their required run rate is. You know I always want to hear from you. Hit the classic old email button using geoff.lemon@theguardian.com, or the tweetphone using @GeoffLemonSport. The big news is that Sarah Taylor is out \u2013 a recurrence of her mental health issues meant she decided she\u2019s not in the right headspace to play. She hasn\u2019t looked it in her last few matches, so it\u2019s a sensible call on her part. Also the young bowling all-rounder Mady Villiers got a call-up. England squad Amy Jones, Danni Wyatt, Heather Knight *, Laura Marsh, Katherine Brunt, Georgia Elwiss, Natalie Sciver, Mady Villiers, Tammy Beaumont, Fran Wilson, Lauren Winfield, Anya Shrubsole, Kate Cross, Sophie Ecclestone Australia squad: Elyse Villani, Alyssa Healy, Meg Lanning *, Rachael Haynes, Ash Gardner, Delissa Kimmince, Ellyse Perry, Nicola Carey, Nicole Bolton, Beth Mooney, Jess Jonassen, Megan Schutt, Tayla Vlaeminck, Georgia Wareham, Sophie Molineux Hello again. Welcome to sunny Essex, home of a lot of things that I don\u2019t know about because I\u2019m not from Essex. Chelmsford is the ground, where Goochy used to prowl with Salim Malik and Mark Waugh in the 1980s. Today it hosts the first of three Women\u2019s Ashes T20s. These have a bit more riding on them than you might expect after England got pantsed in the 50-over games and was nowhere near the mark in the Test match. But by virtue of escaping with a draw, they can still tie this series on points 8-8. Three T20 games, 2 points each, and a 2-8 scoreline at present. They need a clean sweep. Australia meanwhile gave up a lead in the last series to tie it 8-8 and they do not want to do that again. So both teams are going to come out today desperate to win. Should be fun.",

Outside the ground they keep on grinning and hugging and laughing. There\u2019s Joe gazing up at the Kenny Dalglish stand. You know who he\u2019s thinking about. Finally they see the pitch and Joe has to stop and hold his head and take a breath, and by this stage, no I\u2019m not crying, you are, I\u2019m just looking out of the window and being quiet for a bit. It really is worth a watch. And please don\u2019t tell me about Starbucks\u2019s sponsorship, or indeed about the concerns over Rwanda\u2019s current regime, which have their place too. It\u2019s just that Redemption isn\u2019t about these things. It\u2019s about the actual power, the actual magic of this global sport; something that has been owned and styled by the corporate arm but which has within it an unmapped, unmonetised sense of hope.",

      "body": "<p>Let\u2019s start with a public health announcement. Sometimes laughing is better than banging your head on a desk. I confess I chuckled after picking up the Australian on Thursday <a href=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/morrisons-next-quiet-revolution-is-to-reform-public-service/news-story/3980f0642f27aed8723582fee253e731\">and reading</a> that Scott Morrison wanted the federal bureaucracy to become more responsive to better serve the quiet Australians.</p> <p>Just in case you missed it, and you may well have, Canberra\u2019s most senior public servants had already been treated to <a href=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/scott-morrison-pledges-to-address-bureaucratic-blockages-to-policy-delivery/news-story/8bad176704fc870f5d44b780e8127a23\">a very similar homily</a> shortly after the Coalition won the election in May.</p> <p>The prime minister used one of his early picture opportunities to engage in some vigorous-sounding talk about congestion-busting in the bureaucracy, and setting clear performance targets \u2013 the clear instruction being to get your service delivery to the public right, and crack on with implementing our agenda.</p> <p>I wondered at the time whether any of the senior officials lined up for their public remonstrance had the temerity to ask Morrison, once the summoned television cameras had left the cabinet suite: \u201cWell, what agenda are we implementing prime minister? Did you happen to bring it with you?\u201d</p> <p>I suspect they were far too polite to name check the elephant in the room.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/23/scott-morrison-warns-coalition-mps-that-election-win-did-not-give-them-a-blank-cheque\">Scott Morrison warns Coalition MPs that election win did not give them a 'blank cheque'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In any case, my purpose here is not to be gratuitous, because it is completely reasonable for a prime minister to have high expectations of his officials, and it\u2019s also reasonable for us all to ask whether the federal bureaucracy remains fit for purpose in the digital age, which will doubtless be considered in a forthcoming review headed by former Telstra chief David Thodey.</p> <p>The purpose in beginning with Morrison and his finger-wagging at the mandarins is to work through some of the basic contrasts of the week. Having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/04/tax-cuts-pass-senate-in-full-as-labor-backs-down\">passed the income tax cuts in the last sitting period</a>, the new parliamentary week from Morrison\u2019s perspective was supposed to be a simple and satisfying exercise. Let\u2019s call the objective, \u201cheads we win, tails we win\u201d.</p> <p>The business of the week was drought assistance, a national security bill, and a union bill. Labor would either oppose the measures, and be castigated as useless and possibly dangerous in their obstruction, or it would support the bills, and be cast as weak for bowing to the government\u2019s agenda.</p> <p>It was wedge week, in other words. We were supposed to be back to the comforting simplicity of the election campaign: \u201clook at those bozos\u201d \u2013 but with less time on the Townsville Strand declaring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2019/apr/16/federal-election-2019-tax-health-labor-liberal-coalition-morrison-shorten-politics-live?page=with:block-5cb565e88f0852bbb93b8d8a#block-5cb565e88f0852bbb93b8d8a\">if you vote for Bill Shorten you\u2019ll get Bill Shorten.</a></p> <p>So thinking through our contrasts, we had Morrison\u2019s muscular \u201cget on with it shiny bums\u201d rhetoric to the public servants. Playing alongside that we had back to the future in the parliament.</p> <p>In the parliamentary theatre, Morrison wants to point the finger at Labor to buy himself time to work out what he wants to do substantively for the coming term (or, more pertinently, make a calculation about how much he can do, given he didn\u2019t seek a mandate from voters to do very much).</p> <p>As getting-through-the-day strategies go, this is logical enough. Sadly for Morrison, Operation Whack Out the Wedge encountered a couple of crosswinds.</p> <p>One was Angus Taylor, and the eminently reasonable <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/25/government-tries-to-fend-off-angus-taylor-inquiry-with-lobby-group-letter\">questions that won\u2019t go away</a> about the energy minister\u2019s meetings with officials on endangered grasslands, and the possible intersection with his farming interests. The other inconvenience was the ideas boom under way in his own ranks.</p> <p>Coalition MPs are deeply grateful to find themselves still in government. Most of them didn\u2019t expect to be. But given Morrison\u2019s self-professed 18 May miracle has conferred power and opportunity, a number of them don\u2019t want to waste it. Government MPs have policy ideas, and they want to be able to pursue them.</p> <p>That basic dynamic explains the internal breakouts about superannuation, Newstart and nuclear power.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/feb/14/labor-rebukes-coalition-for-siding-with-greens-on-opt-out-superannuation-life-insurance\">Labor rebukes Coalition for siding with Greens on opt-out superannuation life insurance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the ideas boom (fuelled in part by the onset of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/24/new-liberal-senator-backs-indigenous-voice-to-parliament-in-maiden-speech\">maiden speech season</a>) met an immovable object in this week\u2019s Coalition party room, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/23/scott-morrison-warns-coalition-mps-that-election-win-did-not-give-them-a-blank-cheque\">Morrison advised colleagues to be good boys and girls</a>, and work on their ideas inside party processes, rather than treat political life as a rolling seminar.</p> <p>Several MPs were pretty miffed with this feedback for a couple of reasons. The first was that some of the ideas brokers and fellow travellers see other colleagues going free range without much apparent blowback. In fact, sometimes the free-rangers are rewarded for allegedly bad behaviour if they need to be accommodated or neutralised for whatever reason. Call this the default perversity of public life.</p> <p>The second element is an underlying current of frustration that has bubbled away inside the government for a long time. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/05/governments-empty-agenda-has-been-hidden-in-plain-sight-but-reserve-bank-has-made-it-clear-its-time-to-act\">I noted a couple of Saturdays ago</a> the vacancy of the Coalition\u2019s policy agenda over the past couple of terms has been largely concealed from public view, hidden in plain sight, in part because Labor has been prepared to style itself as a government in exile \u2013 constructing a program, conducting substantial policy debates.</p> <p>It\u2019s a tough report card perhaps, but a fair one given the record since 2013, to observe that the Abbott/Turnbull/Morrison governments have lurched between bouts of regicide and managerialism without facing much criticism for their collective lack of imagination as policymakers and purveyors of serious reform.</p> <p> Similar views get expressed privately within the government: a pressing sense that the Coalition is in power, but both time and opportunity are being wasted.</p> <p>So, to put it simply, the current tensions are about a prime minister wanting time and space to chart his own course, and a group of colleagues who know that three-year parliamentary terms are short, and building a public constituency to do something hard takes time. Australia is not standing still, waiting patiently for the Coalition to find sufficient internal equilibrium to be able to move forward.</p> <p>It\u2019s also moot, of course, whether the various ideas doing the rounds are good ones. I can\u2019t fathom why Liberals scratch away relentlessly at superannuation, or why Liberals and Nationals viscerally opposed to carbon pricing would want to reopen a nuclear energy debate, given that\u2019s where that debate inexorably leads. But as the prime minister is fond of saying, you\u2019ve got to have a go to get a go.</p> <p>Given we started with the public servants, I\u2019m inclined to hand the last word to Martin Parkinson, who confirmed this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/25/scott-morrisons-former-chief-of-staff-phil-gaetjens-handed-top-public-service-role\">he would finish up as the secretary of Morrison\u2019s department</a> (the event that triggered round two of the public schooling of public servants).</p> <p>The outgoing secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, who has served a Labor government at war with itself and a Liberal government at war with itself \u2013 a grim spectacle chewing up more than a decade of his public service \u2013 noted that Australia was falling behind in terms of global productivity.</p> <p>Parkinson has an impeccable poker face, so perhaps it\u2019s just me who heard a droll little aside when he observed neutrally that \u201cfor whatever reason\u201d, Australia\u2019s productivity performance is just not keeping up.</p> <p>Hmm, I don\u2019t know. Can anyone think what that reason might be? Might we have a stab? Could it be that officials have spent a decade or so working up policies that get legislated and scrapped, or binned before they can even be legislated as a consequence of the revolving door of prime ministers and culture war supplanting facts and evidence \u2013 the legacy of Australia\u2019s deranged dance of hyper-partisanship? Could it be that?</p> <p>I think Sir Humphrey would have approved of the locution.</p>",

The prime minister used one of his early picture opportunities to engage in some vigorous-sounding talk about congestion-busting in the bureaucracy, and setting clear performance targets \u2013 the clear instruction being to get your service delivery to the public right, and crack on with implementing our agenda. I wondered at the time whether any of the senior officials lined up for their public remonstrance had the temerity to ask Morrison, once the summoned television cameras had left the cabinet suite: \u201cWell, what agenda are we implementing prime minister? Did you happen to bring it with you?\u201d I suspect they were far too polite to name check the elephant in the room. In any case, my purpose here is not to be gratuitous, because it is completely reasonable for a prime minister to have high expectations of his officials, and it\u2019s also reasonable for us all to ask whether the federal bureaucracy remains fit for purpose in the digital age, which will doubtless be considered in a forthcoming review headed by former Telstra chief David Thodey. The purpose in beginning with Morrison and his finger-wagging at the mandarins is to work through some of the basic contrasts of the week. Having passed the income tax cuts in the last sitting period, the new parliamentary week from Morrison\u2019s perspective was supposed to be a simple and satisfying exercise. Let\u2019s call the objective, \u201cheads we win, tails we win\u201d. The business of the week was drought assistance, a national security bill, and a union bill. Labor would either oppose the measures, and be castigated as useless and possibly dangerous in their obstruction, or it would support the bills, and be cast as weak for bowing to the government\u2019s agenda. It was wedge week, in other words. We were supposed to be back to the comforting simplicity of the election campaign: \u201clook at those bozos\u201d \u2013 but with less time on the Townsville Strand declaring if you vote for Bill Shorten you\u2019ll get Bill Shorten. So thinking through our contrasts, we had Morrison\u2019s muscular \u201cget on with it shiny bums\u201d rhetoric to the public servants. Playing alongside that we had back to the future in the parliament. In the parliamentary theatre, Morrison wants to point the finger at Labor to buy himself time to work out what he wants to do substantively for the coming term (or, more pertinently, make a calculation about how much he can do, given he didn\u2019t seek a mandate from voters to do very much). As getting-through-the-day strategies go, this is logical enough. Sadly for Morrison, Operation Whack Out the Wedge encountered a couple of crosswinds. One was Angus Taylor, and the eminently reasonable questions that won\u2019t go away about the energy minister\u2019s meetings with officials on endangered grasslands, and the possible intersection with his farming interests. The other inconvenience was the ideas boom under way in his own ranks. Coalition MPs are deeply grateful to find themselves still in government. Most of them didn\u2019t expect to be. But given Morrison\u2019s self-professed 18 May miracle has conferred power and opportunity, a number of them don\u2019t want to waste it. Government MPs have policy ideas, and they want to be able to pursue them. That basic dynamic explains the internal breakouts about superannuation, Newstart and nuclear power. But the ideas boom (fuelled in part by the onset of maiden speech season) met an immovable object in this week\u2019s Coalition party room, when Morrison advised colleagues to be good boys and girls, and work on their ideas inside party processes, rather than treat political life as a rolling seminar. Several MPs were pretty miffed with this feedback for a couple of reasons. The first was that some of the ideas brokers and fellow travellers see other colleagues going free range without much apparent blowback. In fact, sometimes the free-rangers are rewarded for allegedly bad behaviour if they need to be accommodated or neutralised for whatever reason. Call this the default perversity of public life. The second element is an underlying current of frustration that has bubbled away inside the government for a long time. I noted a couple of Saturdays ago the vacancy of the Coalition\u2019s policy agenda over the past couple of terms has been largely concealed from public view, hidden in plain sight, in part because Labor has been prepared to style itself as a government in exile \u2013 constructing a program, conducting substantial policy debates. It\u2019s a tough report card perhaps, but a fair one given the record since 2013, to observe that the Abbott/Turnbull/Morrison governments have lurched between bouts of regicide and managerialism without facing much criticism for their collective lack of imagination as policymakers and purveyors of serious reform. Similar views get expressed privately within the government: a pressing sense that the Coalition is in power, but both time and opportunity are being wasted. So, to put it simply, the current tensions are about a prime minister wanting time and space to chart his own course, and a group of colleagues who know that three-year parliamentary terms are short, and building a public constituency to do something hard takes time. Australia is not standing still, waiting patiently for the Coalition to find sufficient internal equilibrium to be able to move forward. It\u2019s also moot, of course, whether the various ideas doing the rounds are good ones. I can\u2019t fathom why Liberals scratch away relentlessly at superannuation, or why Liberals and Nationals viscerally opposed to carbon pricing would want to reopen a nuclear energy debate, given that\u2019s where that debate inexorably leads. But as the prime minister is fond of saying, you\u2019ve got to have a go to get a go. Given we started with the public servants, I\u2019m inclined to hand the last word to Martin Parkinson, who confirmed this week he would finish up as the secretary of Morrison\u2019s department (the event that triggered round two of the public schooling of public servants). The outgoing secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, who has served a Labor government at war with itself and a Liberal government at war with itself \u2013 a grim spectacle chewing up more than a decade of his public service \u2013 noted that Australia was falling behind in terms of global productivity. Parkinson has an impeccable poker face, so perhaps it\u2019s just me who heard a droll little aside when he observed neutrally that \u201cfor whatever reason\u201d, Australia\u2019s productivity performance is just not keeping up. Hmm, I don\u2019t know. Can anyone think what that reason might be? Might we have a stab? Could it be that officials have spent a decade or so working up policies that get legislated and scrapped, or binned before they can even be legislated as a consequence of the revolving door of prime ministers and culture war supplanting facts and evidence \u2013 the legacy of Australia\u2019s deranged dance of hyper-partisanship? Could it be that? I think Sir Humphrey would have approved of the locution.",

In: Cameron Bancroft, who has not played for any Australian team since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/mar/28/steve-smith-david-warner-banned-one-year-cricket-australia-ball-tampering\" title=\"\">his ball\u2011tampering ban in 2018</a>. Out: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/01/centuries-for-joe-burns-and-travis-head-put-australia-in-control\" title=\"\">Joe Burns, who made 180 in Australia\u2019s most recent Test match</a>, and 133 a couple of weeks ago for Australia A in the warm-ups.</p> <p>That is not banging the door down, that is camping in the front room for so long that you legally own the house by squatters\u2019 rights. You can question the value of a hundred against an overmatched Sri Lanka, but the same Sri Lanka flew to South Africa a week later to smash them in two Tests. It is the same match where Marcus Harris and Marnus Labuschagne could not make a run between them. Burns dug the team out of a hole those players made at 28 for three, helping add 376. It was not easy at the time.</p> <p>But selectors always wanted Bancroft back. In Australian cricket circles he is considered the unluckiest of the ball-tampering trio; a junior bystander dragged into the mess. He is also a personal favourite of the national coach, Justin Langer, who coached Bancroft\u2019s entire pre-Test career at Western Australia and comforted him on returning home distraught from South Africa.</p> <p>The national men\u2019s team and the top level of management want to consign the tampering story to the past, even though plenty of questions are yet unanswered. Essential to that consignment is breaking the link between the episode and the players. The only method is to get them playing again, building them a more recent cricketing history than that day at Newlands.</p> <p>A nightmare scenario would be if Warner and Smith made comebacks but Bancroft never performed well enough to be picked again. The ghost of his career would haunt theirs, a stub lopped off at eight Tests. So a Bancroft comeback as soon as possible was essential. Even if he is left out at a later date, he will have had his second chance, his subsequent chapter. Cape Town will not be the formal end of his Test career.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Picking Bancroft has its merits. He has been scoring in England, with two centuries among 726 runs for Durham this season, though if the quality of Burns\u2019s runs is under question then second division county cricket is also liable. The main justification from Hohns was Bancroft\u2019s unbeaten 93 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/23/ashes-arms-race-australians-playing-each-other\" title=\"\">in the intra-squad warm-up this week at Southampton</a>, comfortably the highest score on a pitch doing plenty.</p> <p>Hohns may not have meant to let slip that Bancroft was the first choice to partner opener David Warner. \u201cWe\u2019re very comfortable with the form of Marcus Harris. He had a wonderful season back home \u2013 so he probably got the nod over Burns in that area.\u201d The implication is that Burns and Harris vied for one place.</p> <p>Burns has made four centuries in 16 Tests. Bancroft, Harris and fellow squad pick Labuschagne have never made one between them in 19 Tests.</p> <p>Burns has been dropped five times, three of them shortly after big scores and twice after one-off appearances. Once again, after hammering away, he has been told to keep banging on that same old door.</p> <p>If the roles were reversed and Burns\u2019s record belonged to a player that selectors really wanted, then surely it would have been enough. Once again, the door is most useful for getting slammed shut on frankness about decisions.</p>",

Out: Joe Burns, who made 180 in Australia\u2019s most recent Test match, and 133 a couple of weeks ago for Australia A in the warm-ups. That is not banging the door down, that is camping in the front room for so long that you legally own the house by squatters\u2019 rights. You can question the value of a hundred against an overmatched Sri Lanka, but the same Sri Lanka flew to South Africa a week later to smash them in two Tests. It is the same match where Marcus Harris and Marnus Labuschagne could not make a run between them. Burns dug the team out of a hole those players made at 28 for three, helping add 376. It was not easy at the time. But selectors always wanted Bancroft back. In Australian cricket circles he is considered the unluckiest of the ball-tampering trio; a junior bystander dragged into the mess. He is also a personal favourite of the national coach, Justin Langer, who coached Bancroft\u2019s entire pre-Test career at Western Australia and comforted him on returning home distraught from South Africa. The national men\u2019s team and the top level of management want to consign the tampering story to the past, even though plenty of questions are yet unanswered. Essential to that consignment is breaking the link between the episode and the players. The only method is to get them playing again, building them a more recent cricketing history than that day at Newlands. A nightmare scenario would be if Warner and Smith made comebacks but Bancroft never performed well enough to be picked again. The ghost of his career would haunt theirs, a stub lopped off at eight Tests. So a Bancroft comeback as soon as possible was essential. Even if he is left out at a later date, he will have had his second chance, his subsequent chapter. Cape Town will not be the formal end of his Test career. Picking Bancroft has its merits. He has been scoring in England, with two centuries among 726 runs for Durham this season, though if the quality of Burns\u2019s runs is under question then second division county cricket is also liable. The main justification from Hohns was Bancroft\u2019s unbeaten 93 in the intra-squad warm-up this week at Southampton, comfortably the highest score on a pitch doing plenty. Hohns may not have meant to let slip that Bancroft was the first choice to partner opener David Warner. \u201cWe\u2019re very comfortable with the form of Marcus Harris. He had a wonderful season back home \u2013 so he probably got the nod over Burns in that area.\u201d The implication is that Burns and Harris vied for one place. Burns has made four centuries in 16 Tests. Bancroft, Harris and fellow squad pick Labuschagne have never made one between them in 19 Tests. Burns has been dropped five times, three of them shortly after big scores and twice after one-off appearances. Once again, after hammering away, he has been told to keep banging on that same old door. If the roles were reversed and Burns\u2019s record belonged to a player that selectors really wanted, then surely it would have been enough. Once again, the door is most useful for getting slammed shut on frankness about decisions.",

Its main Sports Direct chain was also struggling against a backdrop of tough trading conditions, with weak underlying sales.</p> <p>In the 38-page document, which at various points descended into Ashley\u2019s personal rants about the failings of \u201cself-interested\u201d City advisers, the company said:</p> <ul> <li><p>It had received a \u20ac674m tax bill from the Belgian authorities that relates to products that had been routed internally via Belgium.</p></li> <li><p>House of Fraser\u2019s financial problems could be \u201cterminal\u201d with more store closures likely.</p></li> <li><p>In a frank admission, Ashley indicated that he regretted the House of Fraser deal: \u201cIf we had the gift of hindsight we might have made a different decision in August 2018.\u201d</p></li> <li><p>Its finance director Jon Kempster is stepping down in September, the third senior departure in recent weeks.</p></li> <li><p>The chief executives and finance directors of listed companies should have voluntary drug tests so as to avoid blackmail.</p></li> </ul> <p>Some analysts fear that the colourful deal-maker has taken on too much in the last 18 months, after a buying spree that has seen the \u00a33.7bn group acquire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/30/fears-for-uk-jobs-as-sports-direct-buys-up-evans-cycles\">Evans Cycles</a>, the furniture business <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/01/mike-ashley-adds-sofa-com-to-his-high-street-empire-sports-direct\">Sofa.com</a>, and Game Digital, as well as House of Fraser.</p> <p>The company\u2019s results were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/15/sports-direct-delays-results-amid-house-of-fraser-woes\">originally due to be released on 18 July</a>, but publication was postponed when Sports Direct admitted that the complexities of its House of Fraser takeover and tighter regulatory scrutiny of its auditor, Grant Thornton, due to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/10/watchdog-finds-work-of-patisserie-valerie-auditor-unacceptable\">its role in the Patisserie Valerie collapse</a>, were making the financial results more complicated to prepare.</p> <p>Throughout Friday, Sports Direct set several new deadlines for the publication of its results \u2013 a routine process that for listed companies happens at 7am \u2013 only for them to miss them until after the market had closed. Neil Wilson, an analyst at share trading platform Markets.com, described the delays as a \u201ctotal and utter shambles\u201d.</p> <p>Wilson said the delays showed a total disregard for shareholders: \u201cIt not only raises questions about the haphazard way in which the investor relations and finance teams are run \u2026 it raises a question about whether Ashley will ultimately take the company private.\u201d</p> <p>The hefty tax bill was the biggest upset in the figures as it is the equivalent of several years of annual profits. The tax shock came as the group said it could not put a figure on its future profitability because of the disastrous buyout of the House of Fraser chain, which lost \u00a31m a week in the year to the end of April. Profits for the overall group were up 5% at \u00a3142.3m for the year to April, but that was at the bottom end of expectations.</p> <p>Even before the tax demand came to light, the chaotic day had hit the company\u2019s share price, which closed down nearly 4% at 234p.

      "bodyText": "Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct has warned that its House of Fraser chain has \u201cterminal\u201d problems as the company revealed it had been hit with a bombshell \u20ac674m (\u00a3605m) tax bill from the Belgian authorities. In an extraordinary statement issued 10 hours late \u2013 and after the stock exchange had closed \u2013 the maverick businessman laid bare the state of his retail empire. The billionaire chief executive, who also owns Newcastle United, said that the desperate state of the House of Fraser chain, which the group bought out of administration in 2018, had created \u201csignificant uncertainty\u201d as to the future profitability of the entire group. Its main Sports Direct chain was also struggling against a backdrop of tough trading conditions, with weak underlying sales. In the 38-page document, which at various points descended into Ashley\u2019s personal rants about the failings of \u201cself-interested\u201d City advisers, the company said: It had received a \u20ac674m tax bill from the Belgian authorities that relates to products that had been routed internally via Belgium. House of Fraser\u2019s financial problems could be \u201cterminal\u201d with more store closures likely. In a frank admission, Ashley indicated that he regretted the House of Fraser deal: \u201cIf we had the gift of hindsight we might have made a different decision in August 2018.\u201d Its finance director Jon Kempster is stepping down in September, the third senior departure in recent weeks. The chief executives and finance directors of listed companies should have voluntary drug tests so as to avoid blackmail. Some analysts fear that the colourful deal-maker has taken on too much in the last 18 months, after a buying spree that has seen the \u00a33.7bn group acquire Evans Cycles, the furniture business Sofa.com, and Game Digital, as well as House of Fraser. The company\u2019s results were originally due to be released on 18 July, but publication was postponed when Sports Direct admitted that the complexities of its House of Fraser takeover and tighter regulatory scrutiny of its auditor, Grant Thornton, due to its role in the Patisserie Valerie collapse, were making the financial results more complicated to prepare. Throughout Friday, Sports Direct set several new deadlines for the publication of its results \u2013 a routine process that for listed companies happens at 7am \u2013 only for them to miss them until after the market had closed. Neil Wilson, an analyst at share trading platform Markets.com, described the delays as a \u201ctotal and utter shambles\u201d. Wilson said the delays showed a total disregard for shareholders: \u201cIt not only raises questions about the haphazard way in which the investor relations and finance teams are run \u2026 it raises a question about whether Ashley will ultimately take the company private.\u201d The hefty tax bill was the biggest upset in the figures as it is the equivalent of several years of annual profits. The tax shock came as the group said it could not put a figure on its future profitability because of the disastrous buyout of the House of Fraser chain, which lost \u00a31m a week in the year to the end of April. Profits for the overall group were up 5% at \u00a3142.3m for the year to April, but that was at the bottom end of expectations. Even before the tax demand came to light, the chaotic day had hit the company\u2019s share price, which closed down nearly 4% at 234p. The company told a half-empty meeting of analysts late on Friday night that the demand had come in at \u201cthe 11th hour\u201d. It said it would respond to the requests for information and appeared optimistic that it could fight off the bill. In a stark warning that will worry House of Fraser staff, who have already endured a year of uncertainty following the takeover last August, Ashley said the retailer was struggling to make some stores work even when it was paying landlords no rent at all. So far, just five stores have closed, leaving 54 still trading, but Ashley said it had discovered problems that were \u201cnothing short of terminal in nature\u201d. \u201cOn a scale out of 5, with 1 being very bad and 5 being very good, House of Fraser is a 1,\u201d Ashley said, in characteristically blunt language. \u201cThere are still a number of stores which are currently paying zero rent and that are still unprofitable, and unfortunately this is not sustainable.\u201d The billionaire is a controversial figure in the City. He famously resorted to a game of spoof to settle a \u00a3200,000 legal bill and a court case revealed the billionaire\u2019s penchant for extreme drinking competitions, one of which ended with him vomiting into a fireplace. In a bizarre aside, Ashley made a case for City regulators to ask senior management to take voluntary drug tests, his rationale being that personal issues could lead to blackmail and senior managers making decisions based on \u201csaving their own skin\u201d. He also lashed out at regulators who he said did not have sufficient teeth to prevent self-interested City professionals like lawyers and accountants taking actions that were \u201cabsolutely not in the best interests of their clients and other relevant stakeholders\u201d so that they could earn big fees. Shares in the retail group, in which Ashley is the biggest shareholder, with a stake of almost 62%, have fallen in value by more than 40% in the past year, as analysts became increasingly concerned that the company was struggling to integrate the new business. Ashley\u2019s behaviour had also been erratic as he fought a bitter and ultimately unsuccessful battle for control of Debenhams. The businessman is also embroiled in a bust-up with Goals Soccer Centre, the five-a-side pitch operator whose shares dived after the company admitted that it had underpaid VAT. As Ashley struggles to turn around House of Fraser, Sports Direct has also been struck by the departure of several key executives, including Ashley\u2019s long-term lieutenant, Karen Byers. The departure of finance director John Kempster was also unexpected.",

Leazott says the seal wasn\u2019t intended for a wide audience but since the switch became public his line of T-shirts emblazoned with it has sold out and he\u2019s been scrambling to fulfil more orders. \u201cIt\u2019s cool people are buying this, that\u2019s great and all,\u201d Leazott said. \u201cI am so tickled in the most petty way possible that the president of the United States, who I despise, stood up and gave a talk in front of this graphic. Whoever put that up is my absolute hero.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Take 10 paces back and ask yourself, what just happened? Only when you appreciate what the Conservative party has just done can you begin to consider how Labour, and the other opposition parties, should respond. Indeed, the clearer the Tory move becomes, the more obvious the duty of the opposition.</p> \n<p>Two months ago, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/27/eu-elections-tories-and-labour-savaged-as-voters-take-brexit-revenge\" title=\"\">Tories were crushed</a> in the European elections, their vote share reduced to just 9%. Their problem was that a rival had emerged, making a much clearer pitch on the great question of the age, namely Brexit. Beaten by Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party, the Conservatives reacted swiftly. They dumped a leader deemed insufficiently full-throated on Brexit, replacing her with one whose message is unambiguous. Boris Johnson has now taken office and appointed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/24/boris-johnson-takes-his-revenge-and-sacks-over-half-the-cabinet\" title=\"\">new cabinet</a> that leaves no doubt on Brexit: the new government is fully committed not only to leaving the European Union, but to leaving on 31 October with or without a deal \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/25/brexit-boris-johnson-britain-will-leave-eu-31-october-do-or-die\" title=\"\">do or die</a>\u201d.</p> \n<p>The result is that the Conservatives are ready to face an early election \u2013 so ready, in fact, that the Johnson consigliere and Vote Leave mastermind Dominic Cummings has already <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rowlsmanthorpe/status/1154153775541751810\" title=\"\">launched 554 personalised advertisements</a> on Facebook, apparently rerunning the mass data-harvesting exercise that so shaped the 2016 referendum. The Tories will seek from the electorate either a reward for having delivered Brexit with a deal, or a mandate for delivering Brexit without one \u2013 depending on the resistance they encounter in the coming weeks from Brussels and what the Brexiters call the \u201cremainer parliament\u201d. (The former scenario points to an election in the spring, the latter suggests the autumn.)</p> \n<p>They will head into that campaign confident that they have consolidated the leave vote fully behind Johnson. After all, they will have shot Farage\u2019s fox: why vote for him when you can get the same product from the Tories? Failing that, Johnson could forge an electoral pact with Farage, as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/708d5bee-aefa-11e9-8030-530adfa879c2\" title=\"\">reportedly urged</a> by that ever more active intruder in British politics, Donald Trump. Either way, the story of the last two months is the story of Tory determination never to split the leave vote again, and to ensure those who want Britain out of the EU have a clear and obvious vehicle to climb into.</p> \n<p>Labour\u2019s story could be the mirror image. It too was trounced in May, its vote share reduced to just 14%. Like the Conservatives, it saw a rival emerge, one able to make a much clearer pitch on Brexit. In fact, several rivals emerged \u2013 the Lib Dems, the Greens, the SNP and Plaid Cymru \u2013 all offering an undiluted commitment to staying in the EU. Taken together, and in most cases separately, they did better than Labour.</p> \n<p>If Labour were minded to fight Tory fire with fire, it would know what to do. Labour would now burst the Lib Dem and Green balloons as decisively as the Tories sought to neutralise Farage. It would dump a leader who is insufficiently full-throated on Brexit and replace him with one as unambiguously for remain as Johnson is for leave. It would be ready for that early election, armed with a Brexit stance everyone could understand.</p> \n<p>Instead, there is now a curious asymmetry in British politics. The leave vote is consolidating before our very eyes, while the remain vote is hopelessly fragmented. Given the nature of our electoral system, and with the next election set to be dominated by Brexit, that hands the advantage to Johnson and to the Brexit cause.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b70e0d3460346bc96cdb8d496333455cf6f47816\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b70e0d3460346bc96cdb8d496333455cf6f47816/0_177_5314_3189/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson in the House of Commons\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The new government is fully committed not only to leaving the European Union, but to leaving on 31 October with or without a deal, \u201cdo or die\u201d.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xinhua/Barcroft Media</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The question, then, is clear. Should Labour ape the Tories and declare itself wholly on one side of what is now the great dividing line in British politics?</p> \n<p>There will be costs. Just as Johnson\u2019s hard-right cabinet will repel liberal Conservatives and Tory remainers \u2013 perhaps driving both into the arms of Jo Swinson and the Lib Dems \u2013 so a wholeheartedly remain Labour party could lose its leave voters. It would be a realignment, with the two main parties no longer divided on the traditional lines of class allegiance, nor even right versus left, but leave versus remain.</p> \n<p>Plenty of Labour MPs tremble at that prospect, either because they think they\u2019ll lose their seats, in the Midlands or the north of England, or because they feel that the historic bond between Labour and the working class will be sundered.

      "bodyText": "Take 10 paces back and ask yourself, what just happened? Only when you appreciate what the Conservative party has just done can you begin to consider how Labour, and the other opposition parties, should respond. Indeed, the clearer the Tory move becomes, the more obvious the duty of the opposition. Two months ago, the Tories were crushed in the European elections, their vote share reduced to just 9%. Their problem was that a rival had emerged, making a much clearer pitch on the great question of the age, namely Brexit. Beaten by Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party, the Conservatives reacted swiftly. They dumped a leader deemed insufficiently full-throated on Brexit, replacing her with one whose message is unambiguous. Boris Johnson has now taken office and appointed a new cabinet that leaves no doubt on Brexit: the new government is fully committed not only to leaving the European Union, but to leaving on 31 October with or without a deal \u201cdo or die\u201d. The result is that the Conservatives are ready to face an early election \u2013 so ready, in fact, that the Johnson consigliere and Vote Leave mastermind Dominic Cummings has already launched 554 personalised advertisements on Facebook, apparently rerunning the mass data-harvesting exercise that so shaped the 2016 referendum. The Tories will seek from the electorate either a reward for having delivered Brexit with a deal, or a mandate for delivering Brexit without one \u2013 depending on the resistance they encounter in the coming weeks from Brussels and what the Brexiters call the \u201cremainer parliament\u201d. (The former scenario points to an election in the spring, the latter suggests the autumn.) They will head into that campaign confident that they have consolidated the leave vote fully behind Johnson. After all, they will have shot Farage\u2019s fox: why vote for him when you can get the same product from the Tories? Failing that, Johnson could forge an electoral pact with Farage, as reportedly urged by that ever more active intruder in British politics, Donald Trump. Either way, the story of the last two months is the story of Tory determination never to split the leave vote again, and to ensure those who want Britain out of the EU have a clear and obvious vehicle to climb into. Labour\u2019s story could be the mirror image. It too was trounced in May, its vote share reduced to just 14%. Like the Conservatives, it saw a rival emerge, one able to make a much clearer pitch on Brexit. In fact, several rivals emerged \u2013 the Lib Dems, the Greens, the SNP and Plaid Cymru \u2013 all offering an undiluted commitment to staying in the EU. Taken together, and in most cases separately, they did better than Labour. If Labour were minded to fight Tory fire with fire, it would know what to do. Labour would now burst the Lib Dem and Green balloons as decisively as the Tories sought to neutralise Farage. It would dump a leader who is insufficiently full-throated on Brexit and replace him with one as unambiguously for remain as Johnson is for leave. It would be ready for that early election, armed with a Brexit stance everyone could understand. Instead, there is now a curious asymmetry in British politics. The leave vote is consolidating before our very eyes, while the remain vote is hopelessly fragmented. Given the nature of our electoral system, and with the next election set to be dominated by Brexit, that hands the advantage to Johnson and to the Brexit cause. The question, then, is clear. Should Labour ape the Tories and declare itself wholly on one side of what is now the great dividing line in British politics? There will be costs. Just as Johnson\u2019s hard-right cabinet will repel liberal Conservatives and Tory remainers \u2013 perhaps driving both into the arms of Jo Swinson and the Lib Dems \u2013 so a wholeheartedly remain Labour party could lose its leave voters. It would be a realignment, with the two main parties no longer divided on the traditional lines of class allegiance, nor even right versus left, but leave versus remain. Plenty of Labour MPs tremble at that prospect, either because they think they\u2019ll lose their seats, in the Midlands or the north of England, or because they feel that the historic bond between Labour and the working class will be sundered. For them, a Labour party of the pro-remain cities and university towns, supported mainly by graduates, just wouldn\u2019t be Labour any more. One seasoned MP also urges colleagues to look at the map. The electoral geography means that leave accounts for disproportionately more Commons seats than remain, and leavers often live in marginal seats that Labour needs to win.

As things stand there is no sign that Labour plans to make a shift to clarity equivalent to that undertaken by the Tories. On the contrary, this week saw another round of official denials that Labour is a \u201cremain party,\u201d as well as yet more confusion over whether and when Labour would back a second referendum. This is the void into which the unequivocally remain parties can step and flourish, the Lib Dems and Greens offering themselves as a natural home for those who wish to see Britain stay in the European Union. The response of the online Corbynite army has been to attack Swinson in order to deter any wavering Labourites from defecting. The alternative course would be to offer those voters what Swinson is offering: implacable opposition to Brexit. Instead they seem to believe that you catch more flies with vinegar than with honey when it\u2019s usually the other way around.

But note the warm words with which Caroline Lucas greeted Swinson\u2019s victory, full of talk of \u201creaching out across party lines\u201d. Because that\u2019s the other way to take on the unified forces of leave: a remain alliance of Lib Dems and Greens, reinforced in Scotland and Wales by the anti-Brexit SNP and Plaid.

The decline comes against a backdrop of falling prosecutions and a row about the amount of sensitive personal information requested from alleged victims of rape. Why has the charge rate for rape fallen? The charge or summons rate for rape fell to one in 65, or 1.5%, of all cases reported to the police in England and Wales in 2018/19, according to the latest figures published by the Home Office. The figure has dropped steeply since 2015/16, when one in seven, or 13.7%, of all cases resulted in a charge or summons. Numerous factors have contributed to the decline. More cases are not assigned an outcome or are stalling because of evidential difficulties, such as when a suspect has not been identified or a victim no longer wishes to continue with an investigation. The cases are also complex to investigate and an increasing amount of digital evidence is being requested from complainants. Last year, more than half of all rape cases took more than 100 days to assign an outcome. A charge or summons is one of the steps in proceeding to a trial. Even if a suspect is charged a case may be dropped; and if it proceeds to court a conviction is less likely than it was a decade ago. Are more rapes being reported? The number of rapes being reported to the police has increased from 35,847 in 2015/16 to 57,882 in 2018/19. The rise has been attributed to more victims coming forward in the light of high-profile historical abuse cases and the #MeToo movement. However, the number of rapes recorded by police is far lower than the estimated number of rapes that occur each year. According to figures from a report carried out in 2013, around 97,000 rapes take place in England and Wales every year. Why is it so difficult to get a conviction for rape? Rape is a notoriously difficult crime to prosecute primarily because it comes down to the question of consent, often in a situation where there are only two people. In these cases evidence beyond the word of the victim or defendant is seen as central to building a strong case. Digital evidence requested from complainants, such as data, location information and texts from phones, is time-consuming to investigate. However, even when cases proceed to trial conviction rates differ between age groups. Conviction rates for men aged 18-24 are among the lowest: fewer than a third of prosecutions brought against young men result in a conviction. What are rape victims being asked to disclose? Rape victims may be asked to disclose sensitive personal details when reporting a rape. This can include all digital evidence held on their phone or laptops. An investigation by the Guardian revealed that police may also ask for a wide range of other records from victims at the time of reporting a rape. This can include sensitive personal records including medical, counselling, social services, mental health and education records. Unless there is full disclosure of digital and other personal records, police may drop a case or the CPS may refuse to proceed.",

      "bodyText": "Only one in 65 rape cases reported to police result in suspects being summonsed or charged, a Guardian analysis of the latest crime figures has revealed. The most recent Home Office statistics highlight an alarming decline in rape prosecutions in England and Wales over recent years amid increasingly acrimonious rows over the disclosure of evidence and suggestions that CPS prosecuting policies changed. The drop is particularly dramatic at a time when victims are reporting more attacks. Four years ago one in seven or 14% of cases led to a suspect being charged or summonsed \u2013 a total of 4,908 in 2015-16. Last year fewer than one in 65 reports of rape (1.5%) resulted in a charge or a summons, for a total of only 886 in 2018-19. The extent of the fall emerged as separate Ministry of Justice figures showed that victims of sexual assault were being forced to wait longer to secure justice in the crown court. In response to a question by the shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, MoJ statistics revealed the average waiting time between a defendant\u2019s not guilty plea in magistrates court and a crown court trial has stretched to seven months in sexual offence cases. That is a four-week rise since 2011. In some areas the delays are longer. Complainants in Leeds crown court now wait more than twice as long (43.1 weeks) than they did in 2011 (17.8 weeks). Burgon told the Guardian: \u201cThese are deeply troubling figures. Victims of sexual offences should not have to wait so long for their day in court.

Today is beautifully set up, with aspirant GC contenders knowing they\u2019re running out of road this year. They have a very real need to get a wiggle on.</p> \n  <p>A couple of blips aside, Julian Alaphilippe has looked utterly at home in yellow since first donning it after stage 8, and unless yesterday\u2019s struggles over the Galibier left him more sapped than it appeared, one or more of the chasing pack need to pull out something memorable. <br><br>Alaphilippe\u2019s descending prowess could push them to even bigger efforts on today\u2019s climbs \u2013 yesterday\u2019s fightback on the downhill was a soil-yourself piece of riding by the Frenchman, as he rounded parked motorhomes so tightly on hairpin bends that you feared someone had convinced him they\u2019re all holograms. It may take a career-pinnacle up-and-down effort from the likes of Egan Bernal, Geraint Thomas and Thibaut Pinot to go into Saturday with any chance still remaining.<br><br>Bernal goes into today his closest challenger, as he lies 1min 30 behind the Frenchman, defending champion Thomas is five seconds behind his Ineos teammate in third. Steven Kruijswijk is at 1:47, three seconds ahead of Pinot. </p> \n  <p>Eyes suddenly look beyond Emanuel Buchmann (2:14) in sixth to see if Nairo Quintana can repeat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/25/it-was-geraints-decision-says-egan-bernal-after-attack-on-col-du-galibier\">yesterday\u2019s trick</a> with the altitude holding no fears and a deficit that\u2019s suddenly down to 3:54 from a previously-unlikely 9:30. If the Colombian makes a break for it early on, expect mayhem behind. He jumped from 12th to seventh yesterday. <br><br>First to the top of the Iseran gets the Souvenir Henri-Desgrange, the award handed out for those leading the way over the Tour\u2019s biggest climb each year. Point of order: Quintana won it last year after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jul/25/geraint-thomas-tour-de-france-yellow-jersey-chris-froome-stage-17\">a superb climb up Col du Portet</a>.</p> \n  <p>Good morning folks.

It\u2019s rarely used in the race, and still less frequently at the key point in a stage. It will make it hard for a break to stay away, but teams will fire any domestiques with any strength left up the road to support their leaders later \u2013 Movistar particularly like this tactic \u2013 and the finish will be about who of a very select group has anything left on the short climb to Tignes. Egan Bernal might be the best candidate depending on Ineos\u2019s tactics.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/06/tdf_stage_19/giv-3902cfFvkR9IncgE/\" data-alt=\"Tour de France stage 19\"> \n   <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/06/tdf_stage_19/giv-3902cfFvkR9IncgE/\">Tour de France stage 19</a> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-26T10:44:44.931Z\">at 11.44am BST</time></p> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "The official results are in, with Bernal leading Alaphilippe by 48 seconds. Here\u2019s Jeremy Whittle\u2019s race report: We\u2019re still waiting for official confirmation of the new standings, but Egan Bernal has been awarded the yellow jersey. Time to wrap things up here, but stay tuned for Jeremy Whittle\u2019s race report, and more reaction on our website. We\u2019ll see you tomorrow, right? Here are those provisional standings again: 1 Egan Bernal 2 Julian Alaphilippe +45sec 3 Geraint Thomas +1min 03 4 Steven Kruijswijk +1:15 5 Emanuel Buchmann +1:42 Ineos team principal Sir Dave Brailsford said he had mixed feelings about taking the yellow jersey in such circumstances but it had always been his team\u2019s plan to be aggressive on the day. \u201cFortune favours the brave at the end of the day,\u201d said Brailsford. \u201cWe were always going to take today on and I thought the guys rode really well, to be honest. \u201cThomas and Bernal had a plan \u2013 G went first and then Egan went over the top. \u201cWe were hoping to get to the descent in that situation, and then who knows what would have happened. \u201cWe don\u2019t control the weather. In one way, I\u2019m really happy but in another way, I\u2019m still really concerned for everyone else out there.\u201d Asked if the weather had helped his team win the Tour, as now seems likely, Brailsford replied: \u201cIt didn\u2019t. No, we\u2019ll win the Tour de France because of how we ride.\u201d (credit: PA Media) We\u2019re still waiting on those official general classification standings. Once we have them, you\u2019ll have them. The jerseys have now been handed out at a ceremony in Tignes \u2026 The aforementioned mudslide, incidentally \u2026 Re 17:05, this in from Jack Lee \u2026 DEAD DEAD FAST? What, like this you mean?\u201d Another question in the inbox: Does anyone understand the rationale behind no stage winner and no combativity prize but everything else being awarded? Or is it just me that finds this confusing? My assumption is that this is to factor in the possibility that riders were holding back their biggest effort for the finish. Kind of like the DLS method in cricket, where it takes in the idea that sides are likely to pick up the pace and aggression towards the end of their innings. I\u2019m not sure the organisers will go for it at 48 hours\u2019 notice, but here\u2019s Fraser Innes\u2019s stage 21 suggestion \u2026 RACE IT LIKE THE HAMMER SERIES Set the riders off with the gaps they have between them in such a way that the first man over the line will win the GC. As reported by AP: I gave it all, I don\u2019t have any regret,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been beaten by stronger than me.\u201d Marc Madiot, the manager of Groupama-FDJ, said: Safety is the first priority and the decision to stop the stage seemed to be the only decision to make,\u201d he said. \u201cImagine that the race had continued and a rider had plunged into a ravine.\u201d Ian Davis has a point of order \u2026 Would all those suggesting that the last stage is raced properly like to explain how a short, flat stage is going to affect the GC classifications. If one of the riders pedalled DEAD, DEAD FAST? From the Tour de France site: \u201cThe time bonuses at Col d\u2019Iseran are taken into account. Here are the provisional overall standings\u201d 1 Egan Bernal 2 Julian Alaphilippe +45sec 3 Geraint Thomas +1min 03 4 Steven Kruijswijk +1:15 5 Emanuel Buchmann +1:42 I\u2019m still getting emails with names of 30-year-old films. It was still Ghostbusters II. I\u2019m sorry. It just was. Such an exciting weekend ahead now, on the back of all this, as Andrew (and many others) suggest \u2026 The organisers show their working re: the decision \u2026 1 Egan Bernal 2 Simon Yates +5sec 3 Warren Barguil +41 4 Laurens De Plus +50 5 Steven Kruijswijk = 6 Geraint Thomas = 7 Emanuel Buchmann = 8 Vincenzo Nibali = 9 Richie Porte +1:18 10 Gregor M\u00fchlberger = 11 Wout Poels +1:50 12 Damiano Caruso = 13 Alejandro Valverde = 14 Julian Alaphilippe +2:07 15 Rigoberto Uran +2:30 Wiggins on Eurosport: \u201cI can\u2019t see Bernal losing the race from here.\u201d Meanwhile, Reuters report: Unofficial timings give Bernal a lead of 45 seconds going into Saturday\u2019s final mountain stage, as he seeks to become the first Colombian to win the Tour. Team Ineos sports director Nicolas Portal said: \u201cWe had the race in our hands and Egan would have liked to ride the last climb but the riders\u2019 safety comes first, ASO [organisers] did a great job. \u201cWe wanted to smash it today and the guys were super-motivated. It would have been ideal if the race could have continued because even if he had reduced the gap in the descent, Julian would have suffered in the last ascent.\u201d Very unofficial GC standings \u2026 1 Bernal 2 Alaphilippe 3 Thomas There will be no bonus handed out for the stage win, and no Most Aggressive Rider award. Still no word on whether the mountain climb time bonuses will be applied. This in from Jonathan Pe\u00f1a on the email\u2026 Regardless on whether it was good for him or not, it\u2019s good for us. Now we have a TDF final of sorts to look forward to. Does not get much better than that. John Cook \u2026 Here\u2019s an idea \u2013 race Paris! I think that the best way to handle this situation is to make the stage into Paris an actual race. Of course it breaks tradition, but also it\u2019s an extra 128km that might help sort out this messy stage. Quick PA report of where things are \u2026 The official Tour rolling report is now saying: \u201cDistinctive jerseys will be presented on stage \u2013 yellow and white to Egan Bernal, polka dot jersey to Romain Bardet and green jersey to Peter Sagan.\u201d Interesting conflicts of opinion in my inbox regarding whether the early finish is good or bad for Alaphilippe. Rob Hicky \u2026 Surely this could work out ok for Alaphilippe? While he might (and it\u2019s a big ask) have caught the Thomas group on the descent, given his struggles going up the climb before that then he\u2019d surely have been lost on the final climb and dropped out of the podium places altogether? Hugh Molloy \u2026 Alaphilippe was going to lose 5-10 minutes up the final climb. None of this \u201cunlucky\u201d narrative, he was toast if the stage had gone full distance. But Kenneth Ross \u2026 Completely ridiculous. Alaphilippe was robbed. They need to re-race the section they didn\u2019t race today on Sunday. Move Sunday\u2019s ceremonial ride into Paris to Monday. No one who seriously cares about this race cares about the final stage anyway. Apparently there was no official time checkpoint at the top of Iseran, where the stage results will be taken from. With every second crucial, they are rightly taking their time over publishing official standings. They\u2019re obviously biased, but have a point \u2026 Bradley Wiggins, speaking on Eurosport, is suggesting they could have continued through, or resumed following the affected area. There is a case to be made for neutralising the race, and then continuing afterwards. The perilous descent, and the speeds involved, surely played a part in the decision. The organisers needed to get them to stop riding as soon as possible. It\u2019s such a hard one, and the fallout will be fascinating. It\u2019s a decision that could cost Alaphilippe the Tour \u2013 you have to feel for him. I say again, he was almost freefalling down the mountain. Imagine if he\u2019d fallen round one of the hairpins, and then later found the downhill wasn\u2019t even technically part of the race. License to Kill \u2013 no Jonathan Pena and Jan \u201c40 guesses\u201d Karremans. Sea of Love \u2013 no, Adolfo Prieto. The War of the Roses \u2013 sorry, Brian Goecke. \u201cI really hope it\u2019s Blind Fury what with Rutger Hauer\u2019s passing\u201d \u2013 awwww, apologies Matthew Atkinson. I kind of wish it had been now. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade? Soz Matt Fulford. \u201cGhostbusters\u201d, asks Tom Cox. Ghostbusters? 1989? \u201cGhostbusters 2\u201d, offer Dave Rotheram and Carlos Benitez. HALLELUJAH! Congrats Dave and Carlos, and apologies for anything else you can see in my brain. There had been a landslide as a result of the weather, too. The more we see the road conditions, the worse it all looks. Make absolutely no mistake whatsoever \u2013 the organisers have made the correct decision here. It\u2019s horrible, desperate luck for Alaphilippe, but the riders were rightly kept well away from all this. They\u2019re still untangling this, and meanwhile Eurosport are showing images of a snowplough shovelling thick slush from the road. It\u2019s definitely for the best that nobody was travelling at speed while that was coming down, or this could have been a much grimmer read. *cough, cough, cough, cough corner* 38km to go, **Simon**, not Sean Yates. Apologies. There was a race going on and several dozen people pummelling me with the names of 80s films. \u201cWeekend at Bernal\u2019s\u201d \u2013 kudos to Craig Secor for the wordplay. Still no. Ridiculous swing of weather over the two days, incidentally. It was 40C at points of yesterday\u2019s stage. Meanwhile: Parenthood Road House Born on the Fourth of July Weekend at Bernie\u2019s (\u201cNot very Guardian\u201d \u2013 Thomas Atkins) The Abyss \u201cThe Delinquents starring the one and only Kylie\u201d Tango and Cash Turner and Hooch Drugstore Cowboy Dead Calm See No Evil, Hear No Evil Crimes and Misdemeanors Electric Blue 29 (\u201ca more underground, art house-style film\u201d \u2013 Jon Cowderoy My Left Foot (\u201cin honour of Pinot\u2019s problems\u201d \u2013 Daniel Hellerman) All incorrect. I\u2019m starting to worry I\u2019ve got my years wrong. Oooh \u2013 Uncle Buck. Didn\u2019t think of that. Sorry Eric S \u2013 nope. The riders are easing on down what was set to be a manic plunge. Hard not to feel a bit robbed of what could have been a stunning spectacle. It\u2019s a huge blow for Alaphilippe. Unclear at this stage if the time bonuses from the Col d\u2019Iseran will stand \u2013 we\u2019ll let you know. It\u2019s such a good result for Bernal, however they work it out. From the TV pictures, it looks completely understandable. It\u2019s apparently several inches of hail on the road. Christian Prudhomme is currently taking pelters from riders as he passes them to relay the news. Egan Bernal is going to take yellow. This will take some untangling \u2013 stay with us. And no it\u2019s not Steel Magnolias, dammit. WHAT? Really? Eh? Further ahead it looks like thick snow on the road, but it\u2019s actually hail. Alaphilippe is distraught at hearing the news \u2013 they\u2019ll be taking the results from the top of the Col d\u2019Iseran. He was flying down the descent, and all for naught. Ridiculous drama. 30km to go: points and time bonuses from the big climb 1 Egan Bernal, 40pts, 8sec time bonus 2 Simon Yates, 30, 5sec bonus 3 Warren Barguil, 24, 2sec bonus Willem Van Gemert says Black Rain. Appropriate, but no. Jan Karremans has had way too many guesses, but all wrong so far. My Left Foot and Look Who\u2019s Talking are valiant attempts, mind. Several guesses for The Punisher. Haven\u2019t seen it. Any good? \u201cLean On Me. Obvious really,\u201d says Maurice Murphy. Not strong, sadly. 36km to go: Alaphilippe was 34sec behind Bernal on the virtual standings as the Colombian went over the top, over two mins behind on the stage. But now Alaphilippe is descending. This could be a sight to see. 38km to go: Time bonus for Bernal for reaching the summit first. He leads the stage, with Sean Yates behind. Thomas is now part of a chase group of four, along with Kruijswijk, Buchmann and Le Plus. It\u2019s not The Little Mermaid or Back To The Future II. Or Field of Dreams, or Honey I Shrunk The Kids. Stop guessing When Harry Met Sally and Dead Poets Society. It\u2019s not those. 38.5km to go: Alaphilippe is now in deficit. Seven seconds behind. This is a superb effort from Bernal. 39km to go \u2013 1.6km left to the Roof of the Tour: Bernal is NINE seconds behind Alaphilippe on the virtual GC. Thomas now just 32sec. Remember, it is raining later in the course, and there\u2019s a big descent coming up. 39.5km to go: I\u2019ve just received 16 emails, all naming films from 1989. Bear with me \u2013 both Bernal and Thomas are now well within a minute of Alaphilippe on the virtual GC. 42km to go: Absolute bedlam on the climb. I\u2019m still not clear who the Ineos team leader is \u2013 Bernal initially stayed on Alaphilippe\u2019s shoulder while Thomas rode away, before realising he could move away from him with ease. Steven Kruijswijk is in touch, and the yellow jersey holder is leaking time. But is it enough? We\u2019ve seen slow-mo images of Alaphilippe grimacing already this week, and then look what happened. 43.4km to go: Thomas make a move. It\u2019s a big effort from the Welshman. Alaphilippe is struggling to keep pace. Landa\u2019s leaving him behind too. There\u2019s still 5.5km of Iseran for him to contend with. It\u2019s a huge moment for the defending champion. Jack Lee \u2013 it\u2019s not Bill &amp; Ted\u2019s Excellent Adventure. Robert Hillier \u2013 not Do The Right Thing either. Not Dead Poets Society James Ferguson. Yellow card to Emmanuel Grieve for naming three: Turner and Hooch, Pet Semetary, The Burbs. All thankfully wrong. 44km to go: And then there were two. Dylan van Baarle was the third prong of the Ineos trio, and his work at the front of the peloton is done. The division of labour is now 13 up front, a straggler in Michael Woods, and now just 13 in the group around Alaphilippe. 46km to go: Ineos are pushing at the front of the peloton. Thomas and Bernal are there as part of an Ineos trident. AG2R La Mondiale\u2019s Matthias Frank initially tried to break clear, but to no avail \u2013 his stablemate Bardet is still knocking around, however. TV pictures of Alaphilippe showed him rocking slightly in the saddle before calming. We\u2019re still waiting for a decisive move. 49km: Up, up and away \u2026 time to climb. And here\u2019s me thinking the little bump over the A road on Route 51 was a bit troublesome. Meanwhile, Joseph Trivers is offering varying numbers of thumbs up for more films from 1989 \u2026 Batman \u2013 always had a soft spot for it due to Prince\u2019s soundtrack, and Danny Elfman\u2019s score. I suspect I\u2019m not alone. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, Her Lover \u2013 another fine film score too, this time from Michael Nyman I\u2019m going to keep posting these until someone names the 1989 film I currently have in my head. 50km to go: full intermediate sprint result \u2026 1 Alexey Lutsenko 20 points 2 Tony Gallopin 17 3 Warren Barguil 15 4 Vincenzo Nibali 13 5 Andrey Amador 11 6 Simon Yates 10 7 Gorka Izagirre 9 8 Rigoberto Uran 8 9 Pello Bilbao 7 10 Michael Woods 6 11 Laurens De Plus 5 12 Dylan van Baarle 4 13 Dan Martin 3 14 Patrick Konrad 2 15 Giulio Ciccone 1 Peter Sagan is safely in the yellow jersey group, presumably swapping Panini stickers and telling NSFW jokes. 54km to go: Col d\u2019Iseran coming up. Lots of refuelling, team pep talks, a little bit of sitting back in the saddle going on. Brave faces all round, but some telling deep breaths being taken too. Rain is on the horizon too. Eeeeek. Never mind the climb, the descent could make or break the whole thing for the main players. 58km to go: intermediate sprint fun. An unexpectedly lively fight for the line. Alexey Lutsenko won it by a short helmet ahead of Gallopin, Barguil, Nibali and Amador. More points were handed out a little earlier while I was trying to remember what films came out in 1989 \u2026 61km to go: Big names still safely in the peloton. Bardet, who looked to be suffering earlier as he fell off the back, is safely among the yellow jersey group. Seven of the top eight in the GC standings (Pinot the absentee) are still riding with Alaphilippe around them \u2013 that means Bernal, Thomas, Kruijswijk, Buchmann, Quintana and Landa Meana. Uran and Valverde, who began today in ninth and 10th, are still in the lead group. Adam Yates has just fallen from the back of the peloton. 63km to go: Just the one chase group now as the five merge. Ineos\u2019 Jonathan Castroviejo is currently at the head of the peloton, which is now 1:47 off the front. At this stage that gap is much less significant than the climbs that lie ahead. 64km to go: The field fragments. There are now three groups ahead of the peloton. The leaders now number 21, with stragglers forming two chase groups behind. Aru, Kreuziger, Bettiol, De Gendt and Gesbert are those currently riding \u2018tween front and yellow. 66km to go: Official word on Pinot from Groupama-FDJ. The strapping was on a muscular injury that it was hoped would improve overnight. It evidently hasn\u2019t. And thus: sad toodles to Thibaut. 67km to go: Mollema is blowing. Fighting to the lead group has taken its toll and he\u2019s currently riding an entirely different race to those around him. Richard Donallon writes: What do you think the chances of a Bergal/Thomas duo attack, too risky? If they run ahead, leave it to the two of them for a sprint finish for who leads the team \u2026 As you can tell, I\u2019m a bit of a dreamer. It would be the outcome Ineos fans want, whilst maintaining the newly unpredictable nature of this tour? I think the final climb is going to be mesmerising with this in mind. My suspicions for most of the race have been split evenly between suspecting Thomas isn\u2019t in the form he needs, and waiting for him to explode for a huge effort on one of the mountain stages. There\u2019s little clue of a team hierarchy on the stage yet, which is interesting. 69km to go: More final day thoughts \u2026 71km to go: keep an eye on Uran and Valverde. EF Education First\u2019s Uran isn\u2019t the Colombian most thought would be prominent today, but these are the only two of the top 10 GC riders in the main group. The peloton had dropped to 75sec behind, but with the leaders riding into a headwind, it\u2019s now down to 54sec. Expect that to grow again for a spell as the peloton find the wind brushing their ears. Cort\u2019s lead evaporated almost as quickly as it opened up. 73km to go: A couple more names to report in the lead group \u2013 Bauke Mollema (Trek-Segafredo) and Michael Matthews (Sunweb). Which I only realised as Matthews dropped off the back. He\u2019s wincing, suddenly. Cort is having a go at the front. He\u2019s opened up a 14sec gap. 78km to go: The peloton edges back. Now back to a lovely round minute back from the lead group. On the final stage protocol front, lots of correspondence regarding the 1989 Tour, which ended with an individual time-trial into Paris, out of which Greg LeMond emerged victorious. As with most things from the late-80s, feels like a different world now. An age thing, of course, but is the gap from 1989 to today really the same as that from 1959 to then? The Gap from Ben Hur to Lethal Weapon 2 \u2026 the same as from When Harry Met Sally and Hobbs and Shaw. Sorry, there\u2019s a race happening \u2026 80km to go: The lead group now features 26 riders. Here\u2019s who\u2019s up front, now 62sec ahead of yellow jersey group \u2026 Dylan van Baarle (Ineos) Patrick Konrad (Bora-Hansgrohe) Tony Gallopin (AG2R-La Mondiale) Vincenzo Nibali and Damiano Caruso (Bahrain-Merida) S\u00e9bastien Reichenbach (Groupama-FDJ) Alejandro Valverde, Marc Soler and Andrey Amador (Movistar) Pello Bilbao, Gorka Izagirre, Magnus Cort and Alexey Lutsenko (Astana) Laurens De Plus (Jumbo-Visma) Rigoberto Uran, Alberto Bettiol and Michael Woods (EF Education First) Simon Yates (Mitchelton-Scott) Dan Martin and Fabio Aru (UAE Team Emirates) Giulio Ciccone (Trek-Segafredo) Jesus Herrada (Cofidis) Guillaume Martin (Wanty-Groupe Gobert) Roman Kreuziger (Dimension Data) Warren Barguil and Elie Gesbert (Ark\u00e9a-Samsic) 84km to go: Valuable points for Damiano Caruso. At the top of Mont\u00e9e d\u2019Aussois, the Bahrain-Merida rider took five points. He started the day in third place in the KOM standings. 86km to go: Pinot is off his bike. It\u2019s over. He was almost 5min behind the leaders, and after an arm round the shoulder from a Groupama teammate, he\u2019s done. A sad, sad end to what had been an excellent campaign for the home hope. 89km to go: Pinot is in tears. This is hard to watch. He had a brief spell of trying to fight back, but he\u2019s lost a further 30 secs and it seems hideously unlikely that he\u2019s reaching the finish line today. Meanwhile, Zakarin is off his bike \u2013 mechanical problems have necessitated a change. He\u2019s off again and fighting back to Alaphilippe\u2019s group. 90km to go: the breakaway quartet has been reeled in. There\u2019s now a sizeable bunch of 25 at the front of the race. The peloton is 47sec back. Bradley Wiggins is tracking Pinot\u2019s disintegration well off the back of the peloton for Eurosport. The problem seems to be with the Frenchman\u2019s knee. He\u2019s now 3:30 behind the leaders. 92km to go: Pinot briefly had to stop completely to receive more help. He\u2019s off again, but it looks ominous for the home hope. Don\u2019t forget, he started the stage fifth in GC. Not the biggest of his problems, but his sunglasses look slightly skew-whiff to me as well. 93km to go: Pinot\u2019s receiving attention from a medical support car. Looks like a dressing on his left-thigh is being replaced. He tries to ride off, but away, but looks seriously uncomfortable. He\u2019s off again, but seemingly going backwards. Bardet, meanwhile, has fought back to the peloton, and up ahead there\u2019s a 19-strong chase group. Peloton is now at 53sec back. 96km to go: Bardet is labouring to keep with the yellow jersey group. The polka-dot holder is a surprise struggler. Alaphilippe\u2019s mob are now down to a group of 40. Two riders have gone down round a hairpin bend \u2013 Sergio Henao among them. Both are thankfully up and racing again. 100km to go: the leading quartet are on the descent. Now the stage is on. The peloton fragments as some take a well-earned breather while several put the hammer down to make some ground back. Bradley Wiggins reports some sad-looking faces at the back of the peloton, and there are much more severe climbs still to come today. Meanwhile, Richard Simpson isn\u2019t one for tradition \u2026 Apart from adding in jumps, I can\u2019t think of anything better than watching the first-placed rider, coasting into Paris drinking a glass of champagne for photographers being horrified as the second placed rider bursts past, gets a jump and wins the tour. I\u2019d buy that man\u2019s T-shirt. 102km to go: Riders are gradually feeling the heat at the back of the peloton, and it\u2019s going to be a long day for some. Gap to the front now \u2013 with the same quartet still working hard together \u2013 is just 21secs. Meanwhile Barguil and Gallopin have broken away to try and bridge the gap as the first summit approaches. 104km to go: Another chase group tries to develop. Fabio Aru is prominent. Wellens shows interest too. Nah. Swallowed up again. But the gap to the front is now down to 27secs. 106km to go: The peloton reels in the chase group. The gap to the front is closing, now just 33secs, and the gradual climb is curbing ambitions from those wanting to bridge the gap behind. 108km to go: The chase group becomes a quintet, then an octet. Politt and Rosskopf are joined by Perichon, King, Sicard, Gesbert, Quintanilla and Haga. The main players are yet to make a move, and until that changes, it\u2019s great news for Alaphilippe. 110km to go: Joey Rosskopf has moved up to give Politt a hand. This chase group is now 25secs off the front, with the peloton a further 16 back. 111km to go: Gap is now 39 seconds. Nils Politt is on his own betwixt peloton and breakaway. Mark Ballard asks something that, coincidentally, is an annual argument in the Guardian office that we\u2019ve already had once this morning \u2026 Can you help settle a family argument please? If it was close after Saturday is there any way that the Paris stage would be GC raced rather than a procession? I (aged 41.5) think it wouldn\u2019t be due to history and convention but my Dad (aged 71 and some) reckons it could be \u2026 Imagine being in charge of selling kit for a team that breaks the tradition. 118km to go: Vincenzo Nibali\u2019s on the move. He\u2019s joined by Dan Martin, Jesus Herrada and Pello Bilbao Lopez de Armentia. It\u2019s a pretty convincing break from this quartet \u2013 the gap is 17 seconds and rising. 122km to go: Three riders attempt to burst clear, but the break fails to have a decisive air and the peloton \u2013 for now \u2013 looks largely unconcerned. 124km to go: Tim Wellens looks a reluctant breakaway leader, looking round to see who\u2019s around him. He\u2019s happy to give way and it\u2019s a predictably tentative start. On the weather front, much, much, much kinder temperatures for the riders today. It\u2019s looking like a steady 21C in Tignes through to the finish, but \u2013 interestingly \u2013 raining. Will be fascinating to see if slick roads play a part on the descents. Christian Prudhomme is waving his flag. Stage 19 is now under way. Strap in folks. Alaphilippe looks utterly at ease, chatting with green jersey holder Peter Sagan as the riders prepare for the rollout. A lovely reception from the fans and locals in Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne as the easy 4.8km begins. Declan Clark writes: I don\u2019t want this Tour to end \u2026 Not just because it\u2019s been the most beguiling, exciting and wide-open editions in years, but also because to me, the end of Le Tour is the end of the summer, autumn\u2019s chilly dawn being heralded by the start of the football season next weekend. True, La Vuelta is still to come \u2026 but that\u2019s a bit like being deserted by your teenage sweetheart, and her trying to get her rather dowdy friend to go out with you instead. It just isn\u2019t the same. The desolation outweighs the attempt at consolation. If anyone with Photoshop skills fancies mocking up a Vuelta preview poster with that as the tagline, absolutely feel free. And indeed, Brailsford is giving nothing away. Speaking to Eurosport, the Team Ineos manager says: We came in here wanting to win it \u2013 we still want to win it. There comes a point in time where it\u2019s all or nothing. The person who\u2019s willing to die the most is going to win it. The one who\u2019s turning himself inside-out is Alaphilippe. We want to win. This is coming down to a man-on-man GC battle. There\u2019s six guys fighting it out, and two of those are from the same team. We\u2019ve got to make that count. And so, to the Team Ineos question. Bernal outclimbed and outfought Thomas yesterday, and goes into today with a five-second advantage over the defending champion. So who is the de facto team leader for the remainder of the race? Dave Brailsford told French broadcasters yesterday: \u201cWe will discuss this between ourselves \u2013 we are going to decide tonight. For me, there is no difference of level between the two. They are two good climbers.\u201d Word is the decision has been made, and I\u2019m sure the team will let the riders show the outcome rather than pre-announcing. Bradley Wiggins, speaking on Eurosport, thinks Thomas should be The Man. It\u2019s going to be fascinating, as the Welshman has had the air of a man clinging on for several days. Is there a huge effort in him, given how lightly he raced in preparation for this year\u2019s Tour? Europop? 90s alt-rock? Dinosaurs? Where\u2019s the live cycling (q: two different emailers) We\u2019re just under half an hour from the start of today\u2019s racing, folks. Jonathan Dando writes: I love this Tour \u2026 it\u2019s brilliant. For the first time in years it feels like it\u2019s about the \u2018sport\u2019. There isn\u2019t anyone in the top 10 I would not like to see win. We all want to see a French winner, just for the love of the event, but who would complain if we also see a Colombian or Welsh winner? Despite all the money it\u2019s still the only event/sport which lets the fans in. People want to get dressed up as a polka-dot sperm to run up the hill with the cyclists. I would love to see that in football. Oh my days. Can you imagine polka-dot-clad sperm running up and down the line with the officials at the football? Make it happen Uefa. And you didn\u2019t think I\u2019d missed that surname, did you? Did you really? I\u2019ll be less obvious and give you a version of the original though \u2026 Quick reminder of yesterday\u2019s events \u2026 Geraint Thomas chased a fierce attack by his Team Ineos teammate Egan Bernal, yet still lost second place overall to the Colombian as the tension in the Tour de France ramped up another notch and the unflappable Julian Alaphilippe again clung on to his overall lead. Bernal, widely tipped for victory before the Tour began, was finally unleashed by Team Ineos in the thin air on the approach to the 2,642-metre summit of the Col du Galibier as his fellow Colombian Nairo Quintana rode clear on his own to a third career stage win in the Tour. \u201cIt was Geraint\u2019s decision,\u201d Bernal said of his attack. \u201cHe asked me to attack to try to move the race and tried to come with me but when he saw the other guys on his wheel he just stayed with them. But I attacked because he asked me to attack.\u201d Jeremy Whittle\u2019s full report here \u2026 Jakob Mathiszig-Lee is first into the inbox today \u2026 I have a night shift tonight which is great because it means i have the whole of today to watch what should be an amazing stage. Here on Guardian sport there is occasionally a pleasing wefting of early sport and late shift. It can be a beautiful thing. Sorry, do continue \u2026 Think there\u2019s going to be some fireworks from pretty early on today after Alaphilippe showed some uphill weakness yesterday. Head says Bernal is wearing yellow in Paris but would very much like to see Julian hold on to it today so i can see how half of France fits on to roadside of the final climb tomorrow. He\u2019s not that fussed about yellow. Literally gave it away yesterday before giving interviews (beautiful moment, incidentally) \u2026 Now I won\u2019t lie to you, the first minute of this video may be a slight slog if hi-NRG Europop isn\u2019t your bag. But from 1:01 \u2026 oh mama \u2026 1 Julian Alaphilippe (Fr) Deceuninck-QuickStep 75hrs 18mins 49sec 2 Egan Bernal (Col) Ineos +1:30 3 Geraint Thomas (GB) Ineos +1:35 4 Steven Kruijswijk (Ned) Jumbo-Visma +1:47 5 Thibaut Pinot (Fr) Groupama-FDJ +1:50 6 Emanuel Buchmann (Ger) Bora-Hansgrohe +2:14 7 Nairo Quintana (Col) Movistar +3:54 8 Mikel Landa (Sp) Movistar+4:54 9 Rigoberto Uran (Col) EF Education First +5:33 10 Alejandro Valverde (Sp) Movistar +5:58secs 11 Richie Porte (Aus) Trek-Segafredo +6:30 12 Warren Barguil (Fr) Arkea Samsic +7:47 13 Guillaume Martin (Fr) Wanty-Gobert +15:11 14 Fabio Aru (It) UAE Team Emirates +16:21 15 Roman Kreuziger (Cz) Dimension Data +17:00 Selected others 19 Daniel Martin (Ire) UAE Team Emirates +34:23 27 Adam Yates (GB) Mitchelton-Scott +49:35 33 Nicolas Roche (Ire) Sunweb +1hr:05:40 And so, the Tour hits the roof. This year\u2019s toppermost peak arrives, the Col de l\u2019Iseran, 2,770m above sea level, for the literal highlight of the first of two remaining mountain stages. Today is beautifully set up, with aspirant GC contenders knowing they\u2019re running out of road this year. They have a very real need to get a wiggle on. A couple of blips aside, Julian Alaphilippe has looked utterly at home in yellow since first donning it after stage 8, and unless yesterday\u2019s struggles over the Galibier left him more sapped than it appeared, one or more of the chasing pack need to pull out something memorable. Alaphilippe\u2019s descending prowess could push them to even bigger efforts on today\u2019s climbs \u2013 yesterday\u2019s fightback on the downhill was a soil-yourself piece of riding by the Frenchman, as he rounded parked motorhomes so tightly on hairpin bends that you feared someone had convinced him they\u2019re all holograms. It may take a career-pinnacle up-and-down effort from the likes of Egan Bernal, Geraint Thomas and Thibaut Pinot to go into Saturday with any chance still remaining. Bernal goes into today his closest challenger, as he lies 1min 30 behind the Frenchman, defending champion Thomas is five seconds behind his Ineos teammate in third. Steven Kruijswijk is at 1:47, three seconds ahead of Pinot. Eyes suddenly look beyond Emanuel Buchmann (2:14) in sixth to see if Nairo Quintana can repeat yesterday\u2019s trick with the altitude holding no fears and a deficit that\u2019s suddenly down to 3:54 from a previously-unlikely 9:30. If the Colombian makes a break for it early on, expect mayhem behind. He jumped from 12th to seventh yesterday. First to the top of the Iseran gets the Souvenir Henri-Desgrange, the award handed out for those leading the way over the Tour\u2019s biggest climb each year. Point of order: Quintana won it last year after a superb climb up Col du Portet. Good morning folks. What a day we have in store. Uphill for the first (gulp) 89km, this stage is about one climb, the Col de l\u2019Is\u00e9ran, the \u201croof of the Tour\u201d at 2,770m above sea level. It\u2019s rarely used in the race, and still less frequently at the key point in a stage. It will make it hard for a break to stay away, but teams will fire any domestiques with any strength left up the road to support their leaders later \u2013 Movistar particularly like this tactic \u2013 and the finish will be about who of a very select group has anything left on the short climb to Tignes. Egan Bernal might be the best candidate depending on Ineos\u2019s tactics.",

      "body": "<p>Bryan Magee, who has died aged 89, was hardly a typical member of the political class of the late 20th century. A polymath and a compulsive communicator, he was a bestselling author (with more than 20 books to his name), an award-winning broadcaster and \u201ctelly don\u201d, a philosopher, authority on Richard Wagner, and for a decade an MP, for Labour and the SDP.</p> <p>In 1978 he presented a 15-part series for the BBC, Men of Ideas, in which he interviewed contemporary philosophers about their work, including Isaiah Berlin, AJ Ayer, Noam Chomsky and Iris Murdoch, and won a Royal Television Society award. He followed this a decade later with The Great Philosophers (1987), also for BBC2, featuring him in conversation with major scholars about historical figures in western philosophy from Plato to Wittgenstein. Transcripts of both series were published in book form. </p> <p>Magee regarded philosophy, because it tackled questions about the purpose of life, as the most important subject. He also wanted to rescue it from the excessive professionalism of academia and the barren approaches of logical positivism and linguistic analysis. His book Modern British Philosophy (1971) was based on his BBC Radio 3 series Conversations with Philosophers (1970-71); The Story of Philosophy (1998) covered the ideas of philosophers over 2,500 years; and his Confessions of a Philosopher (1997) was a successful mix of autobiography and analysis. As a popular writer on philosophy, he had a gift for making complex ideas accessible and interesting to the general reader; his many books and television programmes were never exercises in dumbing down.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b0e4eb3d65f6af315fbd2171b23eec8ec6b57c76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0e4eb3d65f6af315fbd2171b23eec8ec6b57c76/0_0_2159_2077/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bryan Magee\" width=\"1000\" height=\"962\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bryan Magee was sustained by visiting appointments at various Oxbridge colleges, and universities including Harvard, Yale, London and Sydney.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eamonn McCabe/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His interest in ideas seemed in part a journey of self-discovery. In his 70s, he wrote two acclaimed memoirs of his childhood in Hoxton, east London; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jun/29/biography.highereducation\" title=\"\">Clouds of Glory (2004)</a> won the JR Ackerley prize for autobiography and was followed by Growing Up in a War (2007). He published a third volume, Making the Most of It, in 2018. A complicated man, he was almost solipsistic in his determination to concentrate on what interested him at the time, a trait that could strike friends as insensitive. But he was also stimulating company, delighting in gossip, others\u2019 as well as his own.</p> <p>Magee was shaped by his childhood in east London in the 1930s. During the second world war he was evacuated to rural Market Harborough in Leicestershire. When he returned, much of Hoxton had been flattened by German bombs. He had a close relationship with his father, Frederick, a man of little education but with a love of culture, who ran a clothing shop. Bryan acquired a passion for theatre and classical music from him; his mother, Sheila (nee Lynch), veered between indifference and opposition to her son\u2019s interests. From Frederick, Bryan also absorbed a love of Wagner and leftwing political views.</p> <p>Encouraged by his father, the bright cockney boy won a London county council scholarship to Christ\u2019s Hospital in Sussex. This ancient public school transformed his life. After school he did national service with the Intelligence Corps and then went to Keble College, Oxford, where he read history, graduated with a second, and gained another with a one-year course in philosophy, politics and economics. While at Oxford he published a volume of verse, Crucifixion and Other Poems (1951), and became president of the Oxford Union in 1953. He and his peers, including William Rees-Mogg, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/dec/04/jeremy-thorpe\" title=\"\">Jeremy Thorpe</a> and Michael Heseltine, expected to become masters of the universe. </p> <p>He then took up a teaching post in Sweden, where he made a short marriage to Ingrid S\u00f6derlund, with whom he had a daughter, Gunnela. After his divorce he had several relationships but never remarried. Back at Oxford he began and abandoned a doctorate in philosophy and then spent a year on a study trip to Yale in the US. There he met and was influenced by the philosopher Susanne K Langer, who introduced him to Kant and Schopenhauer. To read the works in the original, Magee learned German, which gave him a niche in Britain, where few philosophers had studied the language.</p> <p>For a period he taught philosophy at Balliol College but found linguistic philosophy, then in vogue at Oxford, too much like logic-chopping. He also objected to the requirements of teaching to a syllabus and recommending secondary reading on philosophy.</p> <p>If academia was not for him, an academic base was. He was sustained for much of his life by visiting appointments at various Oxbridge colleges, and high\u2013ranking universities including Harvard, Yale, London and Sydney. For many years he held a visiting appointment at King\u2019s College London, specialising in the history of ideas, first as honorary senior research fellow (1984-94) and then visiting professor until 2000.</p> <p>His was a life of the mind, including music and theatre, and he wrote music criticism for many publications, including the Listener, making a profession out of his hobby.

      "bodyText": "Bryan Magee, who has died aged 89, was hardly a typical member of the political class of the late 20th century. A polymath and a compulsive communicator, he was a bestselling author (with more than 20 books to his name), an award-winning broadcaster and \u201ctelly don\u201d, a philosopher, authority on Richard Wagner, and for a decade an MP, for Labour and the SDP. In 1978 he presented a 15-part series for the BBC, Men of Ideas, in which he interviewed contemporary philosophers about their work, including Isaiah Berlin, AJ Ayer, Noam Chomsky and Iris Murdoch, and won a Royal Television Society award. He followed this a decade later with The Great Philosophers (1987), also for BBC2, featuring him in conversation with major scholars about historical figures in western philosophy from Plato to Wittgenstein. Transcripts of both series were published in book form. Magee regarded philosophy, because it tackled questions about the purpose of life, as the most important subject. He also wanted to rescue it from the excessive professionalism of academia and the barren approaches of logical positivism and linguistic analysis. His book Modern British Philosophy (1971) was based on his BBC Radio 3 series Conversations with Philosophers (1970-71); The Story of Philosophy (1998) covered the ideas of philosophers over 2,500 years; and his Confessions of a Philosopher (1997) was a successful mix of autobiography and analysis. As a popular writer on philosophy, he had a gift for making complex ideas accessible and interesting to the general reader; his many books and television programmes were never exercises in dumbing down. His interest in ideas seemed in part a journey of self-discovery. In his 70s, he wrote two acclaimed memoirs of his childhood in Hoxton, east London; Clouds of Glory (2004) won the JR Ackerley prize for autobiography and was followed by Growing Up in a War (2007). He published a third volume, Making the Most of It, in 2018. A complicated man, he was almost solipsistic in his determination to concentrate on what interested him at the time, a trait that could strike friends as insensitive. But he was also stimulating company, delighting in gossip, others\u2019 as well as his own. Magee was shaped by his childhood in east London in the 1930s. During the second world war he was evacuated to rural Market Harborough in Leicestershire. When he returned, much of Hoxton had been flattened by German bombs. He had a close relationship with his father, Frederick, a man of little education but with a love of culture, who ran a clothing shop. Bryan acquired a passion for theatre and classical music from him; his mother, Sheila (nee Lynch), veered between indifference and opposition to her son\u2019s interests. From Frederick, Bryan also absorbed a love of Wagner and leftwing political views. Encouraged by his father, the bright cockney boy won a London county council scholarship to Christ\u2019s Hospital in Sussex. This ancient public school transformed his life. After school he did national service with the Intelligence Corps and then went to Keble College, Oxford, where he read history, graduated with a second, and gained another with a one-year course in philosophy, politics and economics. While at Oxford he published a volume of verse, Crucifixion and Other Poems (1951), and became president of the Oxford Union in 1953. He and his peers, including William Rees-Mogg, Jeremy Thorpe and Michael Heseltine, expected to become masters of the universe. He then took up a teaching post in Sweden, where he made a short marriage to Ingrid S\u00f6derlund, with whom he had a daughter, Gunnela. After his divorce he had several relationships but never remarried. Back at Oxford he began and abandoned a doctorate in philosophy and then spent a year on a study trip to Yale in the US. There he met and was influenced by the philosopher Susanne K Langer, who introduced him to Kant and Schopenhauer. To read the works in the original, Magee learned German, which gave him a niche in Britain, where few philosophers had studied the language. For a period he taught philosophy at Balliol College but found linguistic philosophy, then in vogue at Oxford, too much like logic-chopping. He also objected to the requirements of teaching to a syllabus and recommending secondary reading on philosophy. If academia was not for him, an academic base was. He was sustained for much of his life by visiting appointments at various Oxbridge colleges, and high\u2013ranking universities including Harvard, Yale, London and Sydney. For many years he held a visiting appointment at King\u2019s College London, specialising in the history of ideas, first as honorary senior research fellow (1984-94) and then visiting professor until 2000. His was a life of the mind, including music and theatre, and he wrote music criticism for many publications, including the Listener, making a profession out of his hobby. Relationships were a potential distraction from his interests (\u201cI was never prepared to sacrifice my writing\u201d); he once said he had never fallen in love and was closer to the philosophers he studied than to his friends. He made slow progress in his ambition to become a Labour MP. He fought the safe Conservative seat of Mid Bedfordshire in the 1959 general election and in a byelection the following year. It was another 14 years before he was returned for Leyton, north-east London, in February 1974. In the interim he kept busy by becoming a successful presenter on the current affairs television programme This Week, providing an earnest and progressive standpoint on topics including independence in Africa, and social issues such as prostitution, abortion and homosexuality (the last leading to a book, One in Twenty, in 1966). He also presented a TV series called Arguments (1973), in which he debated issues with leading figures. In this period he wrote an excellent short book on Karl Popper (1973), which did much to extend appreciation of Popper\u2019s views about politics. Neither Harold Wilson nor James Callaghan considered Magee ministerial material (his ambition was to be minister for the arts) and he continued to broadcast and write, including a novel, Facing Death (1977).

His Aspects of Wagner (1968) was followed by Wagner and Philosophy (2000). Ultimate Questions (2016) was a personal meditation on the meaning of life. He lived alone in Oxford, near Wolfson College, where he was a fellow, moving into a nursing home in his last years. He is survived by Gunnela, three grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. \u2022 Bryan Magee, philosopher, writer and politician, born 12 April 1930; died 26 July 2019 \u2022 This article was amended on 28 July 2019.

Sensing the ball was about to come loose from the back of the scrum, as Mr Johnson might put it, he told the Spectator magazine that the Conservatives were finished if they continued to be seen as defenders of the rich and, particularly, the privileged. He argued that \u201cthe wealth gap has been allowed to get too big\u201d and is now \u201coutrageous\u201d. His post-mortem assumed that Mr Cameron was politically a dead man walking and about to be felled in a living standards election. Not for the first time, Mr Johnson\u2019s timing failed him.</p> <p>Mr Cameron won. Mr Johnson had to wait another four years before he got his chance to run the country. His instincts, however, were right. The Tories <a href=\"https://lordashcroftpolls.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MIND-THE-GAPS-LORD-ASHCROFT-POLLS-APRIL-2019.pdf\" title=\"\">are seen as \u201cfor themselves\u201d</a>, \u201cout of touch\u201d and for rich families and pinstriped City workers.

Yet Mr Johnson campaigned to become Tory leader on a platform of <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14212\" title=\"\">tax cuts for the rich</a> combined with a staunch defence of bankers. He was <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-donations/boris-johnson-smashes-record-for-most-money-raised-by-uk-politician-idUKKCN1UC1U7\" title=\"\">bankrolled</a> by billionaires and hedge fund managers. Mr Johnson\u2019s outreach to the rich was understandable given that six out of seven of the voters he was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-48395211\" title=\"\">canvassing</a> do not believe that government should redistribute income from the better-off to those who are less well-off.

      "bodyText": "One the eve of the 2015 election, one that most pollsters thought David Cameron would not win, Boris Johnson gave perhaps the most interesting and insightful interview of his career. Sensing the ball was about to come loose from the back of the scrum, as Mr Johnson might put it, he told the Spectator magazine that the Conservatives were finished if they continued to be seen as defenders of the rich and, particularly, the privileged. He argued that \u201cthe wealth gap has been allowed to get too big\u201d and is now \u201coutrageous\u201d. His post-mortem assumed that Mr Cameron was politically a dead man walking and about to be felled in a living standards election. Not for the first time, Mr Johnson\u2019s timing failed him. Mr Cameron won. Mr Johnson had to wait another four years before he got his chance to run the country. His instincts, however, were right. The Tories are seen as \u201cfor themselves\u201d, \u201cout of touch\u201d and for rich families and pinstriped City workers. Voters don\u2019t look at the Conservatives and see themselves. Yet Mr Johnson campaigned to become Tory leader on a platform of tax cuts for the rich combined with a staunch defence of bankers. He was bankrolled by billionaires and hedge fund managers. Mr Johnson\u2019s outreach to the rich was understandable given that six out of seven of the voters he was canvassing do not believe that government should redistribute income from the better-off to those who are less well-off. That explains why Mr Johnson has backed the Laffer curve, a discredited theory that claims lower tax rates for the rich will lead to higher tax revenues. Now Mr Johnson is in office. He has fired up the grassroots. His problem is that he will at some point soon have to go to the polls and fish for votes from leave-voting sections of society.

The French economist Thomas Piketty has a simpler explanation \u2013 that the EU was part of the dynamics that drove inequality on a global scale. Mr Piketty claims the EU was \u201cbased on competition between countries, on fiscal and social dumping in favour of the most mobile economic actors and functions objectively to the benefit of the most privileged\u201d. The idea that the EU is part of a project that has worked against the interests of the poor has been carefully cultivated on the extreme ends of the left and right. What neither side will admit is that domestic policy was not mobilised in the last few decades to ensure that international competition did not create too many losers. Mr Johnson will not assuage the anger felt in Britain by simply making people better off. Once inflation is taken into account, average earnings are \u00a35 less per week today than in April 2008.

      "body": "<p>Apple contractors regularly hear confidential medical information, drug deals, and recordings of couples having sex, as part of their job providing quality control, or \u201cgrading\u201d, the company\u2019s Siri voice assistant, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>Although Apple does not explicitly disclose it in its consumer-facing privacy documentation, a small proportion of Siri recordings are passed on to contractors working for the company around the world. They are tasked with grading the responses on a variety of factors, including whether the activation of the voice assistant was deliberate or accidental, whether the query was something Siri could be expected to help with and whether Siri\u2019s response was appropriate.</p> <p>Apple says the data \u201cis used to help Siri and dictation \u2026 understand you better and recognise what you say\u201d.</p> <p>But the company does not explicitly state that that work is undertaken by humans who listen to the pseudonymised recordings.</p> <p>Apple told the Guardian: \u201cA small portion of Siri requests are analysed to improve Siri and dictation. User requests are not associated with the user\u2019s Apple ID. Siri responses are analysed in secure facilities and all reviewers are under the obligation to adhere to Apple\u2019s strict confidentiality requirements.\u201d The company added that a very small random subset, less than 1% of daily Siri activations, are used for grading, and those used are typically only a few seconds long.</p> <p>A whistleblower working for the firm, who asked to remain anonymous due to fears over their job, expressed concerns about this lack of disclosure, particularly given the frequency with which accidental activations pick up extremely sensitive personal information.</p> <p>Siri can be accidentally activated when it mistakenly hears its \u201cwake word\u201d, the phrase \u201chey Siri\u201d. Those mistakes can be understandable \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-44701007/gavin-williamson-interrupted-by-siri-during-commons-statement\">a BBC interview about Syria was interrupted by the assistant last year</a> \u2013 or less so. \u201cThe sound of a zip, Siri often hears as a trigger,\u201d the contractor said. The service can also be activated in other ways. For instance, if an Apple Watch detects it has been raised and then hears speech, Siri is automatically activated.</p> <p>The whistleblower said: \u201cThere have been countless instances of recordings featuring private discussions between doctors and patients, business deals, seemingly criminal dealings, sexual encounters and so on. These recordings are accompanied by user data showing location, contact details, and app data.\u201d</p> <p>That accompanying information may be used to verify whether a request was successfully dealt with. In its privacy documents, Apple says the Siri data \u201cis not linked to other data that Apple may have from your use of other Apple services\u201d. There is no specific name or identifier attached to a record and no individual recording can be easily linked to other recordings.</p> <p>Accidental activations led to the receipt of the most sensitive data that was sent to Apple. Although Siri is included on most Apple devices, the contractor highlighted the Apple Watch and the company\u2019s HomePod smart speaker as the most frequent sources of mistaken recordings. \u201cThe regularity of accidental triggers on the watch is incredibly high,\u201d they said. \u201cThe watch can record some snippets that will be 30 seconds \u2013 not that long but you can gather a good idea of what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes, \u201cyou can definitely hear a doctor and patient, talking about the medical history of the patient. Or you\u2019d hear someone, maybe with car engine background noise \u2013 you can\u2019t say definitely, but it\u2019s a drug deal \u2026 you can definitely hear it happening. And you\u2019d hear, like, people engaging in sexual acts that are accidentally recorded on the pod or the watch.\u201d</p> <p>The contractor said staff were encouraged to report accidental activations \u201cbut only as a technical problem\u201d, with no specific procedures to deal with sensitive recordings. \u201cWe\u2019re encouraged to hit targets, and get through work as fast as possible. The only function for reporting what you\u2019re listening to seems to be for technical problems. There\u2019s nothing about reporting the content.\u201d</p> <p>As well as the discomfort they felt listening to such private information, the contractor said they were motivated to go public about their job because of their fears that such information could be misused. \u201cThere\u2019s not much vetting of who works there, and the amount of data that we\u2019re free to look through seems quite broad. It wouldn\u2019t be difficult to identify the person that you\u2019re listening to, especially with accidental triggers \u2013 addresses, names and so on.</p> <p>\u201cApple is subcontracting out, there\u2019s a high turnover. It\u2019s not like people are being encouraged to have consideration for people\u2019s privacy, or even consider it. If there were someone with nefarious intentions, it wouldn\u2019t be hard to identify [people on the recordings].\u201d</p> <p>The contractor argued Apple should reveal to users this human oversight exists \u2013 and, specifically, stop publishing some of its jokier responses to Siri queries. Ask the personal assistant \u201care you always listening\u201d, for instance, and it will respond with: \u201cI only listen when you\u2019re talking to me.\u201d</p> <p>That is patently false, the contractor said. They argued that accidental triggers are too regular for such a lighthearted response.</p> <p>Apple is not alone in employing human oversight of its automatic voice assistants. In April, Amazon was revealed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/11/amazon-staff-listen-to-customers-alexa-recordings-report-says\">to employ staff to listen to some Alexa recordings</a>, and earlier this month, Google workers were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/11/google-home-assistant-listen-recordings-users-privacy\">found to be doing the same with Google Assistant</a>.</p> <p>Apple differs from those companies in some ways, however. For one, Amazon and Google allow users to opt out of some uses of their recordings; Apple offers no similar choice short of disabling Siri entirely. <a href=\"https://www.counterpointresearch.com/global-smartwatch-shipments-grew-48yoy-q1-2019-one-three-apple-watch/\">According to Counterpoint Research</a>, Apple has 35% of the smartwatch market, more than three times its nearest competitor Samsung, and more than its next six biggest competitors combined.</p> <p>The company values its reputation for user privacy highly, regularly wielding it as a competitive advantage against Google and Amazon. In January, it bought a billboard at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/09/google-sundar-pichai-privacy-apple-facebook-data\">announcing that</a> \u201cwhat happens on your iPhone stays on your iPhone\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Apple contractors regularly hear confidential medical information, drug deals, and recordings of couples having sex, as part of their job providing quality control, or \u201cgrading\u201d, the company\u2019s Siri voice assistant, the Guardian has learned. Although Apple does not explicitly disclose it in its consumer-facing privacy documentation, a small proportion of Siri recordings are passed on to contractors working for the company around the world. They are tasked with grading the responses on a variety of factors, including whether the activation of the voice assistant was deliberate or accidental, whether the query was something Siri could be expected to help with and whether Siri\u2019s response was appropriate. Apple says the data \u201cis used to help Siri and dictation \u2026 understand you better and recognise what you say\u201d. But the company does not explicitly state that that work is undertaken by humans who listen to the pseudonymised recordings. Apple told the Guardian: \u201cA small portion of Siri requests are analysed to improve Siri and dictation. User requests are not associated with the user\u2019s Apple ID. Siri responses are analysed in secure facilities and all reviewers are under the obligation to adhere to Apple\u2019s strict confidentiality requirements.\u201d The company added that a very small random subset, less than 1% of daily Siri activations, are used for grading, and those used are typically only a few seconds long. A whistleblower working for the firm, who asked to remain anonymous due to fears over their job, expressed concerns about this lack of disclosure, particularly given the frequency with which accidental activations pick up extremely sensitive personal information. Siri can be accidentally activated when it mistakenly hears its \u201cwake word\u201d, the phrase \u201chey Siri\u201d. Those mistakes can be understandable \u2013 a BBC interview about Syria was interrupted by the assistant last year \u2013 or less so. \u201cThe sound of a zip, Siri often hears as a trigger,\u201d the contractor said. The service can also be activated in other ways. For instance, if an Apple Watch detects it has been raised and then hears speech, Siri is automatically activated. The whistleblower said: \u201cThere have been countless instances of recordings featuring private discussions between doctors and patients, business deals, seemingly criminal dealings, sexual encounters and so on. These recordings are accompanied by user data showing location, contact details, and app data.\u201d That accompanying information may be used to verify whether a request was successfully dealt with. In its privacy documents, Apple says the Siri data \u201cis not linked to other data that Apple may have from your use of other Apple services\u201d. There is no specific name or identifier attached to a record and no individual recording can be easily linked to other recordings. Accidental activations led to the receipt of the most sensitive data that was sent to Apple. Although Siri is included on most Apple devices, the contractor highlighted the Apple Watch and the company\u2019s HomePod smart speaker as the most frequent sources of mistaken recordings. \u201cThe regularity of accidental triggers on the watch is incredibly high,\u201d they said. \u201cThe watch can record some snippets that will be 30 seconds \u2013 not that long but you can gather a good idea of what\u2019s going on.\u201d Sometimes, \u201cyou can definitely hear a doctor and patient, talking about the medical history of the patient. Or you\u2019d hear someone, maybe with car engine background noise \u2013 you can\u2019t say definitely, but it\u2019s a drug deal \u2026 you can definitely hear it happening. And you\u2019d hear, like, people engaging in sexual acts that are accidentally recorded on the pod or the watch.\u201d The contractor said staff were encouraged to report accidental activations \u201cbut only as a technical problem\u201d, with no specific procedures to deal with sensitive recordings. \u201cWe\u2019re encouraged to hit targets, and get through work as fast as possible. The only function for reporting what you\u2019re listening to seems to be for technical problems. There\u2019s nothing about reporting the content.\u201d As well as the discomfort they felt listening to such private information, the contractor said they were motivated to go public about their job because of their fears that such information could be misused. \u201cThere\u2019s not much vetting of who works there, and the amount of data that we\u2019re free to look through seems quite broad. It wouldn\u2019t be difficult to identify the person that you\u2019re listening to, especially with accidental triggers \u2013 addresses, names and so on. \u201cApple is subcontracting out, there\u2019s a high turnover. It\u2019s not like people are being encouraged to have consideration for people\u2019s privacy, or even consider it. If there were someone with nefarious intentions, it wouldn\u2019t be hard to identify [people on the recordings].\u201d The contractor argued Apple should reveal to users this human oversight exists \u2013 and, specifically, stop publishing some of its jokier responses to Siri queries. Ask the personal assistant \u201care you always listening\u201d, for instance, and it will respond with: \u201cI only listen when you\u2019re talking to me.\u201d That is patently false, the contractor said. They argued that accidental triggers are too regular for such a lighthearted response. Apple is not alone in employing human oversight of its automatic voice assistants. In April, Amazon was revealed to employ staff to listen to some Alexa recordings, and earlier this month, Google workers were found to be doing the same with Google Assistant. Apple differs from those companies in some ways, however. For one, Amazon and Google allow users to opt out of some uses of their recordings; Apple offers no similar choice short of disabling Siri entirely. According to Counterpoint Research, Apple has 35% of the smartwatch market, more than three times its nearest competitor Samsung, and more than its next six biggest competitors combined. The company values its reputation for user privacy highly, regularly wielding it as a competitive advantage against Google and Amazon. In January, it bought a billboard at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas announcing that \u201cwhat happens on your iPhone stays on your iPhone\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>A month into 2016, two men were dining one evening in Rotorino, an Italian restaurant in Kingsland Road, Hackney. It rapidly became clear that one of those at the table was deeply distracted, taking regular calls and going outside into darkness for 10 minutes at a time to remonstrate. Each time he returned, he was more contemptuous. An operation was under way to remove him from his job. He started blaming dysfunctional idiots. The name Bernard Jenkin came up a lot. As the punctuated evening wore on, and his linguine rapidly cooled, the dishevelled figure popping up and down from the table gradually relaxed, telling his patient companion he thought it was going to be OK. \u201cThe donors are going to see them off.\u201d</p> <p>It was probably the most concerted effort of many that have been made to marginalise Dominic Cummings from British politics, on this occasion his leadership of the Vote Leave campaign in particular. If it had succeeded, it is quite possible the leave campaign, instead offering a one-dimensional message about immigration, would have lost. But history turned a different page.</p> <p>Now Boris Johnson has decided to appoint Cummings to Downing Street, a brilliantly kept secret that his new adviser will have adored. It propels possibly one of the most controversial and fascinating figures in British politics right into the heart of government. He has a chance to finish what he started back in 2016. The era of lobbing bricks from the sidelines is over.</p> <p>The unique aspect of Cummings is that he is so many different things at once. He has a fascination with strategic long-term challenges akin to that of Oliver Letwin. He has base campaigning instincts to rival Steve Bannon, and a similar contempt for Whitehall systems failure to Louise Casey, Tony Blair\u2019s antisocial behaviour tsar. But in one respect he is completely unmatched: his ability to conduct feuds, or to put it another way, put into practice his highly developed theory about achieving change in unresponsive bureaucracies.</p> <p>For Cummings, corners exist only to be cut and orthodoxies to be challenged.</p> <p>David Cameron, bewildered by the endless incoming fire from the education department during Cummings\u2019s period as a special adviser under Michael Gove, famously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jun/18/david-cameron-dominic-cummings-career-psychopath\">described him as a \u201ccareer psychopath\u201d</a>. Bizarrely the two never met.</p> <p>Equally Nick Clegg, a figure of risible contempt to Cummings, found himself under a ceaseless barrage over a proposal on free school meals. \u201cDreamed up on the back of a cigarette packet\u201d was his most friendly description of the policy. Clegg said Cummings had \u201canger management problems\u201d. Even the chief inspector of schools Sir Michael Wilshaw, once seen as a scourge of teaching mediocrity, was derided by Cummings as out of his depth and insufficiently radical.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5768500614ab58419ced8becfa86ea5929579b6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5768500614ab58419ced8becfa86ea5929579b6a/0_0_724_434/500.jpg\" alt=\"Gove and Cummings in 2012.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gove and Cummings in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Scarff/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gove, polite to a fault, would often feign ignorance of his adviser\u2019s methods, but knew full well the dark arts that Cummings deployed to get his master\u2019s way. It was only after Cummings \u2013 no longer in Gove\u2019s employ \u2013 in one of his highest-octane outbursts called Cameron \u201ca sphinx without a riddle\u201d, his chief of staff Ed Llewellyn a sycophant and his director of communications Craig Oliver clueless, that Gove felt obliged to distance himself. The caustic character assassination was Cummings at his best.</p> <p>His voluminous writing, if it is not bogged down in eugenics, mathematics or causation theory, specialises in a fin de si\u00e8cle absurdity. \u201cAs the black flags of Isis fly and Putin seeks to break Nato, William Hague poses for the cameras with Angelina [Jolie] and Cameron\u2019s closest two advisers stick with the only thing they know \u2013 a 10-day planning horizon (at best) of feeding the lobby (badly) and changing tack to fit the babbling commentariat (while blaming juniors for their own failings).\u201d</p> <p>Now, as he knows full well, there is no one left to blame, but himself. He will act as the interface between Gove and Boris Johnson.</p> <p>Despite predictions that Gove would be put in charge of a major government department, such as Communities, he has instead been put into the Cabinet Office, the government engine room. The Cummings-Gove diarchy is back in harness, preparing for no-deal Brexit, and possibly an early election. The team that brought free schools and expansion of Blairite academies in the face of what they dismissed as \u201cthe blob\u201d are now going to get ready to cut the umbilical cord with the single market.</p> <p>The ministerial civil service code will not quite be chucked in the bin, but it is not likely to be the most heavily thumbed manual in the months ahead.</p> <p>It is not just that Cummings hates individual civil servants \u2013 Olly Robbins and the deceased Lord Heywood were particular objects of his ire \u2013 he hates the whole Northcote-Trevelyan civil service system and believes it is one of Britain\u2019s decrepit institutions that will most benefit from Brexit. \u201cIt keeps out great people, it hoards power to a small number of people who are increasingly crap. And the management of the whole thing is increasingly farcical, like that of any closed bureaucracy keeping its perks. It cannot manage public services, it cannot deal with counter-terrorism. It\u2019s programmed to fail \u2013 and it does.\u201d Brexit, he told the journalist Tim Shipman, \u201cwould force people to think about these things rather than being in the brain dead stupor they have been in the last 20 years where Whitehall just thinks about being in a Brussels meeting\u201d.</p> <p>The temptation will be to see Cummings as the next Steve Hilton, the modernising free-thinking guru to Cameron who arrived in Downing Street in 2015, only to leave spent and defeated after two years. The two men after all share the same betes noires: distant, unaccountable power, thick-witted rules, many from Europe, gold plated by slovenly bureaucrats. Cummings views Europe as like the Ming dynasty: it dwindled because it cut itself off from outside influence.</p> <p>The problem in Hilton\u2019s case was, in the words of Giles Wilkes, then a Liberal Democrat adviser, that he developed \u201cpolicies doomed to dissolve on contact with the world they hoped to change\u201d. He became a \u201cfizzing catherine wheel of chaotic political force spiralling through Whitehall. Prejudices formed in a blink threatened entities that had stood firm for years.\u201d It emerged that Hilton knew more about marketing than about the free market.</p> <p>But Cummings is very different to Hilton, much more directed, focused and target-driven. He has also been around the Conservative party scene much longer. He will have written a plan, not a vision, even if the timing was not perfect, since he had to delay a minor operation to be ready to go into No 10.</p> <p>So what drove him to return? One friend says he simply did not go into government after the Vote Leave triumph because his wife, Mary Wakefield, had just had their baby (during the referendum) and she pretty much forbade him.</p> <p>He could often be seen in the morning outside his local cafe with his baby. Occasionally, if it was hot or indeed very cold, he sat with a scarf over his head, bent double over a book. Anna Karenina, maths and Bismarck are his three obsessions.</p> <p>Wakefield remains a very close friend of Johnson from when he edited the Spectator, but Cummings was not in the loop when Gove decided first time round to have a tilt at the leadership, an event that soured the Johnson-Gove relationship for nearly a year. His child was a few months old, and his energies elsewhere. Now he thinks the risk of a Corbyn government is high if the Tory party opts for a soft Brexit.</p> <p>So will he survive, given the enemies he has made? Cummings\u2019s caustic pen, and tongue, can also hide his true character. \u201cHe is also the first person to say if he doesn\u2019t know something. He has a gentle manner. Truly modest. A good listener. He is very keen to find brilliance in unusual places,\u201d says one friend. \u201cHe is neither hierarchical nor deferential.

      "bodyText": "A month into 2016, two men were dining one evening in Rotorino, an Italian restaurant in Kingsland Road, Hackney. It rapidly became clear that one of those at the table was deeply distracted, taking regular calls and going outside into darkness for 10 minutes at a time to remonstrate. Each time he returned, he was more contemptuous. An operation was under way to remove him from his job. He started blaming dysfunctional idiots. The name Bernard Jenkin came up a lot. As the punctuated evening wore on, and his linguine rapidly cooled, the dishevelled figure popping up and down from the table gradually relaxed, telling his patient companion he thought it was going to be OK. \u201cThe donors are going to see them off.\u201d It was probably the most concerted effort of many that have been made to marginalise Dominic Cummings from British politics, on this occasion his leadership of the Vote Leave campaign in particular. If it had succeeded, it is quite possible the leave campaign, instead offering a one-dimensional message about immigration, would have lost. But history turned a different page. Now Boris Johnson has decided to appoint Cummings to Downing Street, a brilliantly kept secret that his new adviser will have adored. It propels possibly one of the most controversial and fascinating figures in British politics right into the heart of government. He has a chance to finish what he started back in 2016. The era of lobbing bricks from the sidelines is over. The unique aspect of Cummings is that he is so many different things at once. He has a fascination with strategic long-term challenges akin to that of Oliver Letwin. He has base campaigning instincts to rival Steve Bannon, and a similar contempt for Whitehall systems failure to Louise Casey, Tony Blair\u2019s antisocial behaviour tsar. But in one respect he is completely unmatched: his ability to conduct feuds, or to put it another way, put into practice his highly developed theory about achieving change in unresponsive bureaucracies. For Cummings, corners exist only to be cut and orthodoxies to be challenged. David Cameron, bewildered by the endless incoming fire from the education department during Cummings\u2019s period as a special adviser under Michael Gove, famously described him as a \u201ccareer psychopath\u201d. Bizarrely the two never met. Equally Nick Clegg, a figure of risible contempt to Cummings, found himself under a ceaseless barrage over a proposal on free school meals. \u201cDreamed up on the back of a cigarette packet\u201d was his most friendly description of the policy. Clegg said Cummings had \u201canger management problems\u201d. Even the chief inspector of schools Sir Michael Wilshaw, once seen as a scourge of teaching mediocrity, was derided by Cummings as out of his depth and insufficiently radical. Gove, polite to a fault, would often feign ignorance of his adviser\u2019s methods, but knew full well the dark arts that Cummings deployed to get his master\u2019s way. It was only after Cummings \u2013 no longer in Gove\u2019s employ \u2013 in one of his highest-octane outbursts called Cameron \u201ca sphinx without a riddle\u201d, his chief of staff Ed Llewellyn a sycophant and his director of communications Craig Oliver clueless, that Gove felt obliged to distance himself. The caustic character assassination was Cummings at his best. His voluminous writing, if it is not bogged down in eugenics, mathematics or causation theory, specialises in a fin de si\u00e8cle absurdity. \u201cAs the black flags of Isis fly and Putin seeks to break Nato, William Hague poses for the cameras with Angelina [Jolie] and Cameron\u2019s closest two advisers stick with the only thing they know \u2013 a 10-day planning horizon (at best) of feeding the lobby (badly) and changing tack to fit the babbling commentariat (while blaming juniors for their own failings).\u201d Now, as he knows full well, there is no one left to blame, but himself. He will act as the interface between Gove and Boris Johnson. Despite predictions that Gove would be put in charge of a major government department, such as Communities, he has instead been put into the Cabinet Office, the government engine room. The Cummings-Gove diarchy is back in harness, preparing for no-deal Brexit, and possibly an early election. The team that brought free schools and expansion of Blairite academies in the face of what they dismissed as \u201cthe blob\u201d are now going to get ready to cut the umbilical cord with the single market. The ministerial civil service code will not quite be chucked in the bin, but it is not likely to be the most heavily thumbed manual in the months ahead. It is not just that Cummings hates individual civil servants \u2013 Olly Robbins and the deceased Lord Heywood were particular objects of his ire \u2013 he hates the whole Northcote-Trevelyan civil service system and believes it is one of Britain\u2019s decrepit institutions that will most benefit from Brexit. \u201cIt keeps out great people, it hoards power to a small number of people who are increasingly crap. And the management of the whole thing is increasingly farcical, like that of any closed bureaucracy keeping its perks. It cannot manage public services, it cannot deal with counter-terrorism. It\u2019s programmed to fail \u2013 and it does.\u201d Brexit, he told the journalist Tim Shipman, \u201cwould force people to think about these things rather than being in the brain dead stupor they have been in the last 20 years where Whitehall just thinks about being in a Brussels meeting\u201d. The temptation will be to see Cummings as the next Steve Hilton, the modernising free-thinking guru to Cameron who arrived in Downing Street in 2015, only to leave spent and defeated after two years. The two men after all share the same betes noires: distant, unaccountable power, thick-witted rules, many from Europe, gold plated by slovenly bureaucrats. Cummings views Europe as like the Ming dynasty: it dwindled because it cut itself off from outside influence. The problem in Hilton\u2019s case was, in the words of Giles Wilkes, then a Liberal Democrat adviser, that he developed \u201cpolicies doomed to dissolve on contact with the world they hoped to change\u201d. He became a \u201cfizzing catherine wheel of chaotic political force spiralling through Whitehall. Prejudices formed in a blink threatened entities that had stood firm for years.\u201d It emerged that Hilton knew more about marketing than about the free market. But Cummings is very different to Hilton, much more directed, focused and target-driven. He has also been around the Conservative party scene much longer. He will have written a plan, not a vision, even if the timing was not perfect, since he had to delay a minor operation to be ready to go into No 10. So what drove him to return? One friend says he simply did not go into government after the Vote Leave triumph because his wife, Mary Wakefield, had just had their baby (during the referendum) and she pretty much forbade him. He could often be seen in the morning outside his local cafe with his baby. Occasionally, if it was hot or indeed very cold, he sat with a scarf over his head, bent double over a book. Anna Karenina, maths and Bismarck are his three obsessions. Wakefield remains a very close friend of Johnson from when he edited the Spectator, but Cummings was not in the loop when Gove decided first time round to have a tilt at the leadership, an event that soured the Johnson-Gove relationship for nearly a year. His child was a few months old, and his energies elsewhere. Now he thinks the risk of a Corbyn government is high if the Tory party opts for a soft Brexit. So will he survive, given the enemies he has made? Cummings\u2019s caustic pen, and tongue, can also hide his true character. \u201cHe is also the first person to say if he doesn\u2019t know something. He has a gentle manner. Truly modest. A good listener. He is very keen to find brilliance in unusual places,\u201d says one friend. \u201cHe is neither hierarchical nor deferential. But alongside that, he makes no apology for brutal political judgments. He doesn\u2019t think his job is to take the pay cheque and be pleasant \u2013 he is there to bring about change. He hates bullshitters.\u201d He is also not an establishment type. The Spectator annual party is not his scene, even if by necessity he knows his way around the donor class. He may be a disruptor, almost anarchist, but he also takes public service seriously. \u201cWhen working in government for the first time he he taught himself maths to A-level and then degree level in order to properly process info and understand concepts of uncertainty in modelling. He\u2019s also behind the push for maths in specialist schools,\u201d says another friend. \u201cHe brought in physicists to help Vote Leave properly crunch data. Such people will be involved in his plan for any general election. He will via Vote Leave have a huge bank of very helpful data of how people said they would vote in the referendum and how they did vote and therefore how they could behave in the next general election.\u201d It is too early to say whether Cummings is a short-order chef \u2013 contracted to get the UK out of the EU and then provide Johnson with a parliamentary majority \u2013 or is inside No 10 for a long haul. But even if it is only the former, he will have changed the UK forever.",

Police had fought to keep Gobbo\u2019s name a secret, but her identity came to light in March, after it was ruled to be in the public interest.</p> <p>Gobbo had represented major criminal figures in Melbourne at a time when the police were under huge pressure to bring an end to gangland violence. Her exposure as a police informant has rocked Victoria\u2019s justice system and prompted a royal commission inquiry.</p> <p>On Friday, Orman\u2019s conviction for helping to plan the 2002 shooting of Victor Peirce and acting as a driver for the hitman who carried it out was overturned. The prosecution\u2019s case had relied heavily on the word of another of Gobbo\u2019s clients. She had arranged for the witness to testify against Orman.</p> <p>\u201cMs Gobbo\u2019s conduct subverted Mr Orman\u2019s right to a fair trial, and went to the very foundations of the system of criminal trial,\u201d the court said in its judgment.</p> <p>Appeal judges found that Orman had suffered a \u201csubstantial miscarriage of justice\u201d due to the actions of Gobbo, having spent more than a decade behind bars for a murder he always denied. A successful petition for mercy pushed Orman to the head of the appeal court\u2019s queue of her clients, including some of Australia\u2019s biggest-name gangsters.</p> <p>State and federal prosecutors have told 40 people their convictions might have been tainted by Gobbo\u2019s connection to their case. Tony Mokbel, who was jailed in 2012 for masterminding a drug-trafficking operation, is one of four with appeal applications outstanding.</p> <p>Rob Karam and Zlate Cvetanovski, who were also convicted of drug offences, have launched appeals from prison. </p> <p>\u201cMany people will think I have come out of prison bitter and angry. I haven\u2019t,\u201d Orman said after his release. He was swamped by family, friends and supporters following the court declaration that there would be no retrial.</p> <p>Orman said he now wants to spend time with family, including his partner, who has stood by him the whole time. \u201cWe have our time now, and I look forward to our future together,\u201d he said. He also acknowledged the Peirce family, hoping they were receiving support and care after the decision.<br><br>\u201cI am sorry for your loss \u2026 I understand that this process will have been just as traumatic for you as it was for me.\u201d <br></p> <p>The acquittal opens the door for potentially costly compensation for those wrongly convicted of crimes linked to Gobbo. The state has forked out for wrongful convictions before, including in the case of the Melbourne man Farah Jama, who received $525,000 (\u00a3292,472) in 2010 for 18 months spent behind bars after a wrongful rape conviction.</p> <p>Orman had been sentenced to 20 years in prison and would have had another two years to serve before becoming eligible for parole.<br><br>A royal commission is investigating police use of Gobbo as an informer. Hearings are due to resume on Tuesday. Lawyers for Gobbo declined to comment.</p> <p>The premier of Victoria, Daniel Andrews, said there were safeguards, checks and balances to ensure that the scandal surrounding Gobbo never happens again.</p>",

      "bodyText": "More than a dozen of Australia\u2019s most high-profile criminals could have their convictions quashed after their lawyer was revealed to be a police informant. At the end of the first trial related to the \u201cLawyer X\u201d informant scandal, Faruk Orman was freed on Friday after serving 12 years in jail for the killing of a Melbourne crime figure. The trial formed part of a dispute that has resulted in a number of convictions being called into question due to the actions of the lawyer Nicola Gobbo. Last year, court documents revealed that the then unidentified barrister \u2013 dubbed Lawyer X \u2013 had worked as an informant for Victoria police between 2005 and 2009. Police had fought to keep Gobbo\u2019s name a secret, but her identity came to light in March, after it was ruled to be in the public interest. Gobbo had represented major criminal figures in Melbourne at a time when the police were under huge pressure to bring an end to gangland violence. Her exposure as a police informant has rocked Victoria\u2019s justice system and prompted a royal commission inquiry. On Friday, Orman\u2019s conviction for helping to plan the 2002 shooting of Victor Peirce and acting as a driver for the hitman who carried it out was overturned. The prosecution\u2019s case had relied heavily on the word of another of Gobbo\u2019s clients. She had arranged for the witness to testify against Orman. \u201cMs Gobbo\u2019s conduct subverted Mr Orman\u2019s right to a fair trial, and went to the very foundations of the system of criminal trial,\u201d the court said in its judgment. Appeal judges found that Orman had suffered a \u201csubstantial miscarriage of justice\u201d due to the actions of Gobbo, having spent more than a decade behind bars for a murder he always denied. A successful petition for mercy pushed Orman to the head of the appeal court\u2019s queue of her clients, including some of Australia\u2019s biggest-name gangsters. State and federal prosecutors have told 40 people their convictions might have been tainted by Gobbo\u2019s connection to their case. Tony Mokbel, who was jailed in 2012 for masterminding a drug-trafficking operation, is one of four with appeal applications outstanding. Rob Karam and Zlate Cvetanovski, who were also convicted of drug offences, have launched appeals from prison. \u201cMany people will think I have come out of prison bitter and angry. I haven\u2019t,\u201d Orman said after his release. He was swamped by family, friends and supporters following the court declaration that there would be no retrial. Orman said he now wants to spend time with family, including his partner, who has stood by him the whole time. \u201cWe have our time now, and I look forward to our future together,\u201d he said. He also acknowledged the Peirce family, hoping they were receiving support and care after the decision. \u201cI am sorry for your loss \u2026 I understand that this process will have been just as traumatic for you as it was for me.\u201d The acquittal opens the door for potentially costly compensation for those wrongly convicted of crimes linked to Gobbo. The state has forked out for wrongful convictions before, including in the case of the Melbourne man Farah Jama, who received $525,000 (\u00a3292,472) in 2010 for 18 months spent behind bars after a wrongful rape conviction. Orman had been sentenced to 20 years in prison and would have had another two years to serve before becoming eligible for parole. A royal commission is investigating police use of Gobbo as an informer. Hearings are due to resume on Tuesday. Lawyers for Gobbo declined to comment. The premier of Victoria, Daniel Andrews, said there were safeguards, checks and balances to ensure that the scandal surrounding Gobbo never happens again.",

(See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/jul/26/boris-johnson-prime-minister-news-latest-set-up-national-policing-board-as-he-says-hiring-20000-more-officers-will-start-within-weeks-live-news?page=with:block-5d3af4fb8f0845f89e314d9a#block-5d3af4fb8f0845f89e314d9a\"> 2.37pm.) </a>But my colleague <strong>Severin Carrell</strong>, the Guardian\u2019s Scotland editor, points out (fairly) that I left out the Scottish dimension. He\u2019s sent me this.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Amidst all the talk of a snap election this autumn, it is unwise to ignore the likely scale of an Scottish National party \u201cwin\u201d in Scotland. All the recent polls show the SNP will romp home with a larger number of seats: not quite as high as the 56 out of 59 seats they won in 2015 but they\u2019re on course to easily surpass 40, leaving the other parties trailing.</p> <p>Those numbers will have significant impact on the prospects of both the Tories and Labour of winning a majority in the Commons, where the SNP is currently the third largest party.</p> <p>The SNP are <a href=\"http://whatscotlandthinks.org/questions/how-would-you-be-likely-to-vote-in-a-uk-general-election-asked-since-2017-gener#line\">currently polling at around 40% for a Westminster election. </a>Scottish Labour is in freefall under Richard Leonard\u2019s lacklustre leadership, and is now below 20% - as are the Scottish Tories. That makes it impossible for Labour to win the 20 seats in Scotland it needs to gain a Commons majority; indeed it will struggle to hold the seven it won in 2017.</p> <p>Now, we don\u2019t know how many centrist and anti-Boris pro-UK voters will switch to the Lib Dems (which did very well in Scotland in the European elections and now have a young, female Scottish leader) but it\u2019s quite possible the LDs will win a couple of more seats, more likely from the Tories in rural areas where farming will be heavily hit by a no deal Brexit. </p> <p>And with those polling numbers, it is hard to see the Scottish Tories holding onto their current tally of 13 Scottish seats: the conflicts and contradictions between Ruth Davidson, a strong soft-Brexiteer who has built the Tory renaissance by appealing to centrist voters, and Johnson are too significant.</p> <p>While there are pockets of strong pro-Brexit sentiment in Scotland, there are not enough pro-Brexit votes here to make the difference in first past the post seats other than in north east Scotland and, potentially, in the rural south west - areas where the Tories already have MPs. (It is also the case that with Johnson as Tory leader, the Brexit party has no chance of winning a Westminster seat in Scotland.)</p> <p>And if the SNP clean-up north of the border, the constitutional crisis over Brexit will be amplified by a constitutional crisis over Scottish independence.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-26T15:53:31.909Z\">at 4.53pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d3b1e818f0845f89e315056\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/kateconnolly\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-26T15:40:19.848Z\">4.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Angela Merkel</strong> has wished Boris Johnson \u201ca sure hand\u201d in his new role as British prime minister inviting him to visit Berlin in a telephone call.</p> <p>The German chancellor interrupted her summer break to speak to Johnson today, in a conversation which a spokeswoman said focussed on Brexit as well as future bilateral relations.</p> <p>The spokeswoman, Ulrike Demmer said Merkel \u201ccongratulated him on assuming his new office and wished him a sure hand in exercising the duties of this responsible task.\u201d</p> <p>Demmer said the leaders\u2019 conversation centred \u201caround the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union as well as efforts to deepen bilateral relations\u201d.</p> <p>She added that Johnson had accepted the invitation to visit Berlin.

itemprop=\"text\"><p><b>Andrew</b> \u2013 with all eyes on a possible vote of No Confidence as a way of stopping Boris Johnson as PM taking the UK out of the EU on No Deal:</p> <p>Given that a vote of

the date of the GE to be set <i>before</i> 31st October?</p> <p>It is the PM who advises the Queen to set the date \u2013 which is made by proclamation.</p> <p>As Johnson is PM what is to stop him,

explanation of the various rules that determine how much time must elapse between a no confidence vote in the Commons and a general election. Given that Labour has not tabled a no confidence motion for the first day back in September, it now seems impossible to have a general election before 31 October against the wishes of the government.</p> <p>Even if there were a no confidence vote on 3 September, as the note explains, the PM could set a later date for a general election.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-comment\" data-canonical-url=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/131416738\">  <div class=\"d2-comment-embedded\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Comment\"> <div class=\"d2-left-col\"> <a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3214745\" title=\"View Welshbloom\u2019s profile\"> <img class=\"d2-avatar\" src=\"https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/3214745\" height=\"40\" width=\"40\" alt=\"User avatar for Welshbloom\"> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-right-col\"> <div itemscope itemprop=\"author\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\"> <a class=\"d2-username\" href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3214745\" title=\"View Welshbloom\u2019s profile\" itemprop=\"url\"> <span itemprop=\"givenName\">Welshbloom</span> </a> </div> <div class=\"d2-permalink\"> <a class=\"d2-datetime\" href=\"https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/131416738\" title=\"Link to this comment\" itemprop=\"datePublished\">26 July 2019 10:53am</a> </div> <div class=\"d2-body\" itemprop=\"text\"><p>Andrew - could you please explain what Boris's thinking might be behind an autumn election, assuming it's planned to occur pre-Brexit? Much though Labour is in a fairly miserable position, aren't the Tories equally vulnerable to their vote being split by Brexit Party candidates standing everywhere? If the Remain factions do get themselves sorted enough to identify a single remain-friendly candidate in most consituencies, hasn't Boris got an awfully hard job on his hands to get a majority?</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <p>You\u2019re right. An autumn election would be huge gamble for Boris Johnson. The polls suggest the electorate is broadly split four ways - Tory, Labour, Lib Dems, Brexit party - and the Peterborough byelection showed how a Tory/Brexit party split can let Labour through.</p> <p>But - </p> <p>a) Johnson may be assuming that it is going to happen anyway, whether he wants one or not. As far as I can tell, the only parliamentary mechanism which would definitely stop a no-deal Brexit would be a no confidence vote. And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/18/brexit-latest-newst-commons-vote-no-deal-gauke-hints-he-may-rebel-ahead-of-knife-edge-vote-intended-to-stop-no-deal-prorogation-live-news?page=with:block-5d3072c38f08d0b6ca53318b#block-5d3072c38f08d0b6ca53318b\">the prorogation vote last week </a>suggests that in extremis there are enough Tory MPs who feel strongly about no-deal to ensure Boris Johnson would lose a vote like this. It is probably now too late to ensure an election before 31 October. (See above.) But it is possible that rebel Tories could try to force Johnson to delay Brexit (ie, ask for another article 50 extension) pending the result of the general election by promising to install Jeremy Corbyn as PM if he does not.</p> <p>b) The Brexit party bubble may be about to burst. Johnson has formed what looks like a Brexit party government, and it is possible that Brexit party support could start to evaporate over the next few weeks. Look at the Brexit party vote in yesterday\u2019s two council byelections: at 16% and 10%, it was well below what it is polling nationally.

Johnson began by declaring that he wanted to end the feud between Downing Street cat Larry, and his rival across the street at the Foreign Office, Palmerston, who famously do not get on. He then apparently suggested the idea of getting a dog - to cries of approval from the assembled staffers.

They did discuss Brexit.</p> <p>When the prime minister has these conversations with fellow leaders and the discussion moves onto Brexit, he will be setting out the same message which he delivered in the House of Commons yesterday and in his conversation with President Juncker.</p> <p>He wants to do a deal. He will be energetic in trying to seek that deal but the withdrawal Agreement has been rejected three times by the House of Commons. It is not going to pass. That means reopening the withdrawal agreement and securing the abolition of the backstop.</p> </blockquote> <p>The spokesman was repeatedly asked when talks with the EU on Brexit might resume. The spokesman said the UK was ready to engage in talks, but he also kept repeating the point about the need for the EU to accept the need to get rid of the backstop. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are clear-eyed about what needs to happen if we are going to be able to secure a deal which parliament can support. </p> </blockquote> <p>When asked if the UK would refuse to engage in fresh talks unless the EU agreed to change its stance on this point, the spokesman would not explicitly confirm that this was a precondition. But he did not deny it either, and he repeated the point about the current withdrawal agreement being unacceptable to the Commons.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson has formally added the title \u201cminister for the union\u201d to his job title, to stress his commitment to the union. </strong>This is a symbolic change that he promised during the leadership contest.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has told Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, that the EU must abandon the backstop if it wants to reach an agreement on Brexit with the UK. (See 3.51pm.) The two leaders spoke as Downing Street played down the prospect of Brexit talks with the EU reopening until Brussels agreed to drop the backstop. Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, has described Boris Johnson\u2019s approach to Brexit talks as putting the UK \u201con a collision course with the EU\u201d. The French government has warned Boris Johnson against playing games with the Irish border. Labour has called for Boris Johnson to dismiss a new Downing Street staff member who has praised the work of a far-right, anti-Islam politician, while anti-racism campaigners expressed alarm at her appointment. Sheffield Hallam MP, Jared O\u2019Mara, has announced he will be taking time out to deal with his mental health after his former aide accused him of being \u201cthe most disgustingly morally bankrupt person I have ever had the displeasure of working with\u201d. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Earlier, in response to a question from a reader, I posted a paragraph explaining why Boris Johnson might not be quite as fearful of an early general election as people generally think he should be. (See 2.37pm.) But my colleague Severin Carrell, the Guardian\u2019s Scotland editor, points out (fairly) that I left out the Scottish dimension. He\u2019s sent me this. Amidst all the talk of a snap election this autumn, it is unwise to ignore the likely scale of an Scottish National party \u201cwin\u201d in Scotland. All the recent polls show the SNP will romp home with a larger number of seats: not quite as high as the 56 out of 59 seats they won in 2015 but they\u2019re on course to easily surpass 40, leaving the other parties trailing. Those numbers will have significant impact on the prospects of both the Tories and Labour of winning a majority in the Commons, where the SNP is currently the third largest party. The SNP are currently polling at around 40% for a Westminster election. Scottish Labour is in freefall under Richard Leonard\u2019s lacklustre leadership, and is now below 20% - as are the Scottish Tories. That makes it impossible for Labour to win the 20 seats in Scotland it needs to gain a Commons majority; indeed it will struggle to hold the seven it won in 2017. Now, we don\u2019t know how many centrist and anti-Boris pro-UK voters will switch to the Lib Dems (which did very well in Scotland in the European elections and now have a young, female Scottish leader) but it\u2019s quite possible the LDs will win a couple of more seats, more likely from the Tories in rural areas where farming will be heavily hit by a no deal Brexit. And with those polling numbers, it is hard to see the Scottish Tories holding onto their current tally of 13 Scottish seats: the conflicts and contradictions between Ruth Davidson, a strong soft-Brexiteer who has built the Tory renaissance by appealing to centrist voters, and Johnson are too significant. While there are pockets of strong pro-Brexit sentiment in Scotland, there are not enough pro-Brexit votes here to make the difference in first past the post seats other than in north east Scotland and, potentially, in the rural south west - areas where the Tories already have MPs. (It is also the case that with Johnson as Tory leader, the Brexit party has no chance of winning a Westminster seat in Scotland.) And if the SNP clean-up north of the border, the constitutional crisis over Brexit will be amplified by a constitutional crisis over Scottish independence. Angela Merkel has wished Boris Johnson \u201ca sure hand\u201d in his new role as British prime minister inviting him to visit Berlin in a telephone call. The German chancellor interrupted her summer break to speak to Johnson today, in a conversation which a spokeswoman said focussed on Brexit as well as future bilateral relations. The spokeswoman, Ulrike Demmer said Merkel \u201ccongratulated him on assuming his new office and wished him a sure hand in exercising the duties of this responsible task.\u201d Demmer said the leaders\u2019 conversation centred \u201caround the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union as well as efforts to deepen bilateral relations\u201d. She added that Johnson had accepted the invitation to visit Berlin. He is expected to combine it with a visit to French president Emmanuel Macron. Political insiders in Berlin say the visit could take place as early as next week but no date has been announced. The arrival of Johnson in Downing Street has been met with a mix of bewilderment and defiance in Berlin, where he is often referred to, particularly in the boulevard press, as \u2018Brexit Boris\u2019. Berlin has repeatedly ruled out reopening Britain\u2019s withdrawal agreement with the EU, putting particular emphasis on its refusal to renegotiate the Northern Ireland back-stop unless a viable alternative is found. Here are some pictures from Boris Johnson\u2019s visit to West Midlands Police\u2019s learning and development centre. I have not found any pictures of people posing for selfies with him yet. This is from Sky\u2019s Sam Coates, who has obviously seen TV footage of Boris Johnson\u2019s walkabout this afternoon that has not been broadcast yet. This is from the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Harry Cole. My colleague Peter Walker, author of the excellent Bike Nation, approves. Downing Street has announced that six junior ministers (all parliamentary under secretaries of state) are saying in post. They are: Kevin Foster, a Welsh Office minister and Cabinet Office minister, and government whip Chloe Smith, a Cabinet Office minister Rebecca Pow, a culture minister Guy Opperman, a work and pensions minister Will Quince, another work and pensions minister Nusrat Ghani, a transport minister and government whip And here is the German read-out from the Boris Johnson/Angela Merkel call. This is from Ulrike Demmer, a German government spokeswoman. Boris Johnson has had a telephone call with Angela Merkel, the German chancellor. According to the Downing Street read-out, Merkel got exactly the same message about how the backstop must go that Emmanuel Macron received. (See 12.38pm.) A Number 10 spokesman said: The PM today received a call of congratulations from German chancellor Angela Merkel. They agreed to continue to strengthen our bilateral relationship, and to work together closely on foreign policy and security issues. On Brexit, the PM said that he would be energetic in reaching out as much as possible to try to achieve a deal, but he reiterated the message he delivered in the House of Commons yesterday: parliament has rejected the withdrawal agreement three times and so the UK must fully prepare for the alternative \u2013 which is to leave without a deal on October 31. He said the only solution that would allow us to make progress on a deal is to abolish the backstop. The PM and chancellor agreed to stay in contact. The pound has been falling in value this afternoon in the light of Simon Coveney\u2019s comments about Brexit (see 1.08pm), the BBC\u2019s Faisal Islam reports. It looks like Tobias Ellwood has been sacked. Ellwood, a defence minister, said at the weekend that a no deal Brexit could plunge the Tories into opposition for an awfully long period of time. But two days later he said he would not be resigning from government. Now he is out. He has posted this on Twitter. The final line of his tweet, \u201cSi vis pacem, para bellum\u201d, means \u201cIf you want peace, prepare for war\u201d. Whether that is a comment on defence spending, or on relations with Downing Street, remains to be seen. Ellwood was honoured for his bravery after he intervened to try to save the life of PC Keith Palmer, the police officer killed in the Westminster terror attack in 2017. Julian Smith, the new Northern Ireland secretary, has been visiting Derry. As the BBC reports, Smith was greeted by protesters from the Bloody Sunday Justice Campaign, as well as activists in favour of same-sex marriage and Irish language legislation. We\u2019ve had another instalment of the reshuffle. These are all parliamentary under secretary of state appointments, or the equivalent, which is the most junior level of minister. Sideway move Nadhim Zahawi moves from education to business. Staying put Kelly Tolhurst remains a business minister. John Glen remains economic secretary to the Treasury. Graham Stuart remains an international trade secretary. Victoria Atkins remains a Home Office minister and minister for women. Here are two questions from below the line that I\u2019ll answer up here because they raise issues of general interest. This Commons library briefing note has a good explanation of the various rules that determine how much time must elapse between a no confidence vote in the Commons and a general election. Given that Labour has not tabled a no confidence motion for the first day back in September, it now seems impossible to have a general election before 31 October against the wishes of the government. Even if there were a no confidence vote on 3 September, as the note explains, the PM could set a later date for a general election. You\u2019re right. An autumn election would be huge gamble for Boris Johnson. The polls suggest the electorate is broadly split four ways - Tory, Labour, Lib Dems, Brexit party - and the Peterborough byelection showed how a Tory/Brexit party split can let Labour through. But - a) Johnson may be assuming that it is going to happen anyway, whether he wants one or not. As far as I can tell, the only parliamentary mechanism which would definitely stop a no-deal Brexit would be a no confidence vote. And the prorogation vote last week suggests that in extremis there are enough Tory MPs who feel strongly about no-deal to ensure Boris Johnson would lose a vote like this. It is probably now too late to ensure an election before 31 October. (See above.) But it is possible that rebel Tories could try to force Johnson to delay Brexit (ie, ask for another article 50 extension) pending the result of the general election by promising to install Jeremy Corbyn as PM if he does not. b) The Brexit party bubble may be about to burst. Johnson has formed what looks like a Brexit party government, and it is possible that Brexit party support could start to evaporate over the next few weeks. Look at the Brexit party vote in yesterday\u2019s two council byelections: at 16% and 10%, it was well below what it is polling nationally. (See 9.59am.) If that were to happen, and with the remain vote fragmented between lots of parties that don\u2019t like or trust each other, Tory chances in an early election might be quite promising. Boris Johnson could be joined in Downing Street by a new companion - a pet dog, the Press Association reports. The prime minister is understood to have raised the prospect of bringing in man\u2019s best friend when he addressed staff in Number 10 for the first time. Johnson began by declaring that he wanted to end the feud between Downing Street cat Larry, and his rival across the street at the Foreign Office, Palmerston, who famously do not get on. He then apparently suggested the idea of getting a dog - to cries of approval from the assembled staffers. Insiders acknowledged that any new four-legged resident of Number 10 would have to get on with Larry, who was originally brought in by David Cameron to deal with the Downing Street mice. However a decision may be some way off. \u201cIt is a longer-term project,\u201d a source said. Downing Street has just announced a new tranche of ministerial appointments. Promotions George Freeman has been made minister of state at transport. He was a junior minister until 2016, but since then he has been on the backbenches. Annabel Goldie, a peer, has been made a minister of state at defence. She was a whip in the House of Lords. Lord Ashton of Hyde has been made chief whip in the Lords. He was a junior culture minister. Sideways moves Nick Hurd, who was a minister of state at the Home Office, has been made minister of state at the Northern Ireland Office. But he remains minister for London. Michael Ellis becomes solicitor general. He was a minister of state at transport. Staying put Lady Williams of Trafford remains minister of state at the Home Office and minister for equalities. Lord Ahmad remains minister of state at the Foreign Office. Lord Callanan remains minister of state at the Brexit department. This is what Simon Coveney, the Irish deputy prime minister, said this morning about how Boris Johnson has put the UK \u201con a collision course\u201d with the EU over Brexit. (See 11.56am.) Coveney said: The statements of the British prime minister yesterday in the House of Commons were very unhelpful to this process. He seems to have made a deliberate decision to set Britain on a collision course with the European Union and with Ireland in relation to the Brexit negotiations, and I think only he can answer the question as to why he is doing that. Coveney described Johnson\u2019s comments as \u201cvery bad from a Brexit negotiations perspective\u201d and said his approach \u201cis not the basis for an agreement\u201d. He went on: I think from a Brexit negotiating perspective, it was a very bad day yesterday, we will have to wait whether that message coming from London changes in the weeks ahead. Steve Baker, the Tory Brexiter and deputy chair of the European Research Group, has told the Evening Standard that he is is worried Boris Johnson will ask MPs to back \u201ca \u2018compromise\u2019 withdrawal agreement with a time limit on the backstop\u201d, Joe Murphy reports. Baker and his fellow ERG hardliners think only the complete removal of the backstop would be acceptable. In his Commons statement yesterday Johnson did say the backstop would have to go for good. He told MPs: If an agreement is to be reached it must be clearly understood that the way to the deal goes by way of the abolition of the backstop. Downing Street repeated this line this morning, also using the word \u201cabolition\u201d. (See 12.38pm.) But, for reasons that are perhaps understandable, some Tory MPs are perhaps worried that Johnson does not always mean what he says. Here is a full summary of the Downing Street lobby briefing. No 10 is playing down the prospect of Brexit talks with the EU reopening until Brussels agrees to drop the backstop. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said that Boris Johnson spoke to Emmanuel Macron, the French president, last night. Describing the call, the spokesman said: The purpose of the call was to congratulate the prime minister. They did discuss Brexit. When the prime minister has these conversations with fellow leaders and the discussion moves onto Brexit, he will be setting out the same message which he delivered in the House of Commons yesterday and in his conversation with President Juncker. He wants to do a deal. He will be energetic in trying to seek that deal but the withdrawal Agreement has been rejected three times by the House of Commons. It is not going to pass. That means reopening the withdrawal agreement and securing the abolition of the backstop. The spokesman was repeatedly asked when talks with the EU on Brexit might resume. The spokesman said the UK was ready to engage in talks, but he also kept repeating the point about the need for the EU to accept the need to get rid of the backstop. He said: We are clear-eyed about what needs to happen if we are going to be able to secure a deal which parliament can support. When asked if the UK would refuse to engage in fresh talks unless the EU agreed to change its stance on this point, the spokesman would not explicitly confirm that this was a precondition. But he did not deny it either, and he repeated the point about the current withdrawal agreement being unacceptable to the Commons. Johnson has formally added the title \u201cminister for the union\u201d to his job title, to stress his commitment to the union. This is a symbolic change that he promised during the leadership contest. The spokesman said Johnson confirmed this change to his job title at cabinet yesterday. The spokesman said that Johnson had \u201cpositive discussions\u201d on the phone last night with Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, Mark Drakeford, Wales\u2019s first minister, Arlene Forster, the leader of the DUP, and Michelle O\u2019Neill, the leader of Sinn Fein in Northern Ireland. Johnson stressed in those calls that he would be a prime minister for the whole of the UK, the spokesman said. Johnson has not received a congratulatory call from Donald Trump, the US president, since his arrival in Number 10, the spokesman confirmed. The spokesman said the government\u2019s fiscal targets for debt and borrowing are under review. The spokesman said there more minister of state appointments would be coming soon. After that Downing Street would start appointing the most junior ministers, he said. Number 10 hopes to get as many of those appointments as possible done today, the spokesman added. The spokesman was unable to say whether cabinet would meet on Tuesday next week. The French government has warned Boris Johnson against playing games with the Irish border after the new British prime minister demanded the ditching of the backstop, my colleague Daniel Boffey reports. At its regular briefing the European Commission also said that there are no meetings scheduled yet between the EU and Boris Johnson\u2019s government. The commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, spoke to Johnson on the phone yesterday, and said officials remain available should the UK wish to hold talks. But today the commission\u2019s spokeswoman, Natasha Bertaud, said: I have no further announcements in terms of timing or planning of that to announce today. She added that the commission noted Johnson\u2019s announcement that he would not nominate a UK commissioner for the incoming administration under Ursula von der Leyen, who is expected to take office on November 1, after the Brexit deadline. The EU\u2019s \u201cworking assumption\u201d was for an October 31 Brexit but if the UK was still in the EU on November 1 \u201cthis is a bridge that we will cross when we come to it\u201d, Bertaud said. David Mundell, who was sacked as Scottish secretary by Boris Johnson on Tuesday, has said he \u201cwill not shirk\u201d from challenging the new prime minister if his policies risk boosting calls for Scotland\u2019s independence. Mundell had been openly hostile to Johnson\u2019s leadership bid, making it widely known he feared his populist and at time jingoistic brand of politics, and his openness to a no deal Brexit, threatens the future of the UK. In a commentary piece for the Scottish edition of the Daily Mail, Mundell, who served as Scottish Office minister and then Scottish secretary for nine years, suggested he was hopeful that Johnson was listening to those anxieties and would act on them. Insisting he was willing to accept Johnson\u2019s assurances that the chances of a no deal Brexit \u201cwere a million to one against\u201d, his article was peppered to coded warnings. Mundell said Sturgeon wanted to ensure a no deal departure would be \u201cchaotic\u201d and boost independence. He went on: The new prime minister must work hard to ensure that does not happen. Having listened carefully to everything he has had to say over the past few weeks, I\u2019m hopeful ... I take the prime minister at his word, but I made clear that I see my role as a backbench MP as holding him to account on his commitment to the union \u2013 and I will not shirk from doing so. These are from my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll, who has been following Simon Coveney, the Irish deputy prime minister\u2019s, meeting with the new Northern Ireland secretary, Julian Smith, at Stormont. I\u2019m just back from the Downing Street lobby briefing. Here are the three main lines No 10 is playing down the prospect of Brexit talks with the EU reopening until Brussels agrees to change the backstop. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman did not explicitly say there would be no negotiations this summer, but, when asked if the UK was requesting talks, he repeatedly said that the EU would have to accept the need for the withdrawal agreement to change before there would be any point in the two sides meeting. Boris Johnson set out his views in a conversation with Emmanuel Macron, the French president, last night. Johnson has formally added the title \u201cminister for the union\u201d to his job title, to stress his commitment to the union. This is a symbolic change that he promised during the leadership contest. Johnson has not received a congratulatory call from Donald Trump, the US president, since his arrival in Number 10, the spokesman confirmed. I will post a full summary soon. Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the US House of Representatives, has restated her view that congress will not pass a UK-US trade deal if Boris Johnson\u2019s government puts the open border between Ireland and Northern Ireland at risk, the Irish Times reports. Pelosi said: We made it clear in our conversations with senior members of the Conservative party earlier this year that there should be no return to a hard border on the island. That position has not changed. Any trade deal between the US and Great Britain would have to be cognisant of that. I\u2019m off to the Number 10 lobby briefing now. I will post again after 11.30am. Some figures in the Boris Johnson camp are pushing back against the conventional media assumption, which has been fuelled by what Johnson has been doing and saying over the last 48 hours, that he is planning for an early general election. This is from the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth. And this is from the political blogger Guido Fawkes (real name - Paul Staines), who was actively campaigning for Johnson to become Tory leader. Good news for all those in Downing Street working on the reshuffle: Peter Bone, the outspoken Tory Brexiter, is available to serve. Bone, a serial rebel, is one of those MPs assumed at Westminster to be destined for a lifetime on the backbenches, but when he was asked on Sky\u2019s All Out Politics if he would take a job in Boris Johnson\u2019s government, he replied: Yeah, I would, actually. The odds of that are extremely unlikely. But I would, because I want to support Boris. I went up and down the country running the \u2018Back Boris\u2019 rallies to support him. He also said he was not concerned by the reports that his fellow hardline Brexiter Steve Baker turned down a job in government. He suggested that had more to do with Baker wanting to replace Nicky Morgan (back in cabinet now as culture secretary) as chair of the Commons Treasury committee than with Baker having doubts about Johnson\u2019s commitment to Brexit. According to Jim Pickard and Gillian Tett in today\u2019s Financial Times (paywall), Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, and some Donald Trump supporters in the US are backing a new group, World4Brexit, which is being set up to lobby for Brexit. Farage told the FT he was not convinced Boris Johnson will deliver Brexit. Mr Farage, speaking just before the fundraiser at the New York Athletic Club in Manhattan, said the donations would all be \u201cabove the board and legal\u201d. The cash would not go to political candidates and would be used to \u201cdig deep, find out who is really running the show\u201d, according to the fundraising documents ... Mr Farage said that W4B was still in a \u201cstart-up\u201d phase, and had been organised \u201cat the American end\u201d by Gerry Gunster, the American political strategist who in 2016 helped Leave.EU, the unofficial referendum campaign for the UK to leave the EU. Its fundraising literature said \u201cwe have donors from all across the United States and across the globe\u201d, and stressed that \u201call our money [raised] will follow the letter of the law in the eyes of the IRS\u201d. As a not-for-profit organisation, it can take donations ranging from $5 to $5,000. As Pickard says, World4Brexit is also making false claims about how much the billionaire philanthropist George Soros has donated to remain campaigns. There were three council byelections yesterday. Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party was putting up candidates for the first time in council byelections in two of the wards. They did not win, and instead the Lib Dems gained two seats. Britain Elects has the results. And here is the Press Association story. Simon Coveney, Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, is meeting the new Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith at 10am, in the first British-Irish engagement since Boris Johnson became prime minister. Smith is in Belfast this morning for his first round of meetings with parties at Stormont followed by a trip to Derry this afternoon. The former chief whip is said to have been the Democratic Unionist party\u2019s choice as new secretary of state as they have come to know him well in Westminster. The meeting with Coveney be the first opportunity for the two sides to discuss Brexit in the wake of Johnson\u2019s combative exchanges of the past 24 hours. Getting Stormont up and running again is a stated priority of Johnson. In an interview with ITV\u2019s Robert Peston a week ago he said \u201cideally you want Stormont up and running\u201d and the \u201cchain of command\u201d restored in region, which has been without devolved government for more than two years. On the Today programme this morning Bertie Ahern, who was Irish prime minister at the time of the Good Friday agreement said that Boris Johnson was being \u201cnot bright\u201d in trying to make 31 October a rigid deadline for Brexit. He told the programme: I just don\u2019t see how such a tight timescale - [it\u2019s] nothing to do with the determination, or skill, or ability, or anything - just to agree a whole new agreement, it\u2019s just very hard to see how that can be done by Halloween. Commenting on Johnson\u2019s claim that technology can provide an alternative to controls at the Irish border after Brexit, he said: I think we should all avoid trying to come up with simplistic solutions that this can all be done just by waving a hand or the stroke of a pen. It is complex, it is difficult, it is new, and I think forcing a deadline into that is not bright, and I put it no stronger than that. These are from Alan Travis, the Guardian\u2019s former long-serving home affairs editor, on the announcement about extra police officers. And this is from John Sutherland, a former police officer who blogs on policing. It\u2019s Boris Johnson\u2019s second full day in office and, in a move that will do nothing to quell suspicions that we\u2019ve already slipped into the early phase of a general election campaign, Johnson has announced that he will start the process of recruiting 20,000 extra police officers \u201cwithin weeks\u201d. Interestingly, he also says that he will set up a new national policing board to ensure that police forces do hire the extra officers needed. Here is an explanation from the news release. Chaired by the home secretary and bringing together key police leaders, it will hold the police to account for meeting this target and drive the national response to the most pressing issues that affect communities right across the country. The National Police Chiefs Council has put out a statement from its chairman, Martin Hewitt, welcoming the announcement, saying that having a new board will \u201cenable us work together to prioritise operational focus and investment in order to have the maximum impact in keeping the public safe.\u201d But in an interview on the Today programme the council\u2019s chief executive Mike Cunningham said that hiring the extra officers would not be straightforward. He explained: There are a wide variety of logistical challenges that come with the recruitment process ... Not just getting people through the doors, [but] the assessment process, the attraction, recruitment campaigns, the vetting, all of those sorts of logistical challenges, and then of course training people, making sure they are fit for the responsibilities that they have. And Labour says Johnson cannot be trusted to honour the promise he has made. In a statement Louise Haigh, the shadow policing minister, said: When it comes to policing, Boris Johnson simply cannot be trusted. He served in a government which promised to protect the police, then voted for brutal real-terms cuts. As mayor of London, he vowed to recruit thousands of officers, but police numbers fell on his watch. The damage caused by these broken promises and brutal cuts cannot be reversed and the know-how that thousands of experienced bobbies brought to the job is gone for good - at a time when we\u2019ve never needed it more. We should hear more from the prime minister himself later. Number 10 are holding a lobby briefing this morning, and Johnson is doing a visit in the Midlands in the afternoon. Parliament is in recess, and the Westminster diary is empty, but the reshuffle of junior ministers is continuing, and so we should get more names announced today. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news.

I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone.

On this, they are quite optimistic, pointing to Oliver Letwin telling the Commons on Thursday: \u201cI personally will certainly vote for any arrangement he makes for an orderly exit from the EU.\u201d They see an appetite from the anti-no deal camp for any deal at all, which will make trying to sell even a poor deal much easier. They also haven\u2019t all been ostracised from their one-nation caucus of MPs just for being in government. In fact, the remainer-ish ministers say they need the support of all their colleagues on the outside, as there just aren\u2019t enough of them to be able to do all the work. But there is bad blood between individuals: Amber Rudd has been chucked out of one of the main WhatsApp groups for her pivot to supporting the option of no deal in order to remain in government. Johnson also kept Rudd waiting for quite some time before confirming that she was staying in the Department for Work and Pensions, causing some of those colleagues to joke that her change of heart hadn\u2019t even worked. Some are still wondering whether they\u2019ll stay in the Tory party at all. This week Margot James \u2013 who resigned in the last days of the May government to vote for the latest attempt to stop the prime minister suspending parliament to force no deal through \u2013 told the Guardian she couldn\u2019t rule out leaving the Conservatives altogether after Johnson\u2019s \u201cmassive shift to the right\u201d. There is talk of a split even among those in government, though following the implosion of the nascent centrist Independent Group for Change party that formed this year, it\u2019s not clear where they would go. There is also confusion over whether this group of moderates will have a leader. It has been branded \u201cthe Gaukward squad\u201d, mainly because the pun on David Gauke\u2019s name sounds so good, but ex-chancellor Philip Hammond is also clearly keen to appear a leading figure. Plots in all parties often fail if there is tension over who is running the show, and the anti-no-deal gang face stiff competition for Johnson\u2019s attention from the equally grumpy European Research Group. They have the summer to get over their qualms about where they\u2019ve all ended up and get organised. Otherwise all of them will have to find hobbies considerably more consuming than going to the cricket and the odd dirty weekend. \u2022 Isabel Hardman is assistant editor of the Spectator and presenter of Radio 4\u2019s Week in Westminster",

      "body": "<p>The European Investment Bank has vowed to end its multibillion euro financing for fossil fuel projects by the end of next year in order to align its strategy with climate targets.</p> <p>The EU\u2019s lending arm has drafted plans, seen by the Guardian, which propose cutting support for energy infrastructure projects which rely on oil, gas or coal by barring companies from applying for loans beyond the end of 2020.</p> <p>The EIB said its focus on long-term investments means that it must align with the Paris Agreement which aims to cap global heating at 1.5C above 1990 levels by cutting greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>\u201cThis transition will be profound. Solidarity is required to ensure that potentially vulnerable groups or regions are supported,\u201d the EIB report said.</p> <p>The lender said it will set up an energy transitions fund to support projects which help EU member states to transition to a cleaner economy. In the past the EIB has funded fossil fuel projects including the Trans Adriatic gas pipeline and oil storage facilities in Cyprus.</p> <p>The crackdown on fossil fuel lending comes amid growing pressure on financial institutions to cut their exposure to high-carbon projects.</p> <p>Last month 80 civil society organisations and academics <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/12/worlds-biggest-sovereign-wealth-fund-to-ditch-fossil-fuels\">published an open letter to the EIB</a> calling on the bank to end its fossil fuel financing, which topped \u20ac2.4bn (\u00a32.1bn) in 2018.</p> <p>The letter, which was coordinated by the campaign group Counter-Balance, accused the bank of \u201clagging behind the science\u201d underpinning the climate crisis.</p> <p>The UK has also come under criticism for increasing its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/27/uk-spent-nearly-2bn-on-fossil-fuel-projects-overseas-last-year\">support for fossil fuel projects by </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/27/uk-spent-nearly-2bn-on-fossil-fuel-projects-overseas-last-year\">11-fold to almost \u00a32bn last year</a> through the agency UK Export Finance. The agency\u2019s funding for renewable energy developers fell at the same time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alex Doukas, from environmental campaigner Oil Change International, said: \u201cThe EIB\u2019s proposal to end financing for fossil fuels by 2020 is a massive step forward in climate leadership. With this move, the world\u2019s largest multilateral lender is now poised to leave oil, gas and coal in the past.</p> <p>\u201cThe EU member states who control the bank must now stand behind the EIB\u2019s ambitious climate vision, and other financial institutions should quickly follow suit to stop funding fossils,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Colin Roche, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth Europe said the proposal is \u201ca crack of light in the darkness\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhile the EU and national governments are floundering as the planet burns, the EU\u2019s public bank has made the brave, correct and just proposal to stop funding fossil fuel projects. We are now urging the European Investment Bank\u2019s board to endorse this step forward, and ensure there are no loopholes for fossil fuel funding.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The European Investment Bank has vowed to end its multibillion euro financing for fossil fuel projects by the end of next year in order to align its strategy with climate targets. The EU\u2019s lending arm has drafted plans, seen by the Guardian, which propose cutting support for energy infrastructure projects which rely on oil, gas or coal by barring companies from applying for loans beyond the end of 2020. The EIB said its focus on long-term investments means that it must align with the Paris Agreement which aims to cap global heating at 1.5C above 1990 levels by cutting greenhouse gas emissions. \u201cThis transition will be profound. Solidarity is required to ensure that potentially vulnerable groups or regions are supported,\u201d the EIB report said. The lender said it will set up an energy transitions fund to support projects which help EU member states to transition to a cleaner economy. In the past the EIB has funded fossil fuel projects including the Trans Adriatic gas pipeline and oil storage facilities in Cyprus. The crackdown on fossil fuel lending comes amid growing pressure on financial institutions to cut their exposure to high-carbon projects. Last month 80 civil society organisations and academics published an open letter to the EIB calling on the bank to end its fossil fuel financing, which topped \u20ac2.4bn (\u00a32.1bn) in 2018. The letter, which was coordinated by the campaign group Counter-Balance, accused the bank of \u201clagging behind the science\u201d underpinning the climate crisis. The UK has also come under criticism for increasing its support for fossil fuel projects by 11-fold to almost \u00a32bn last year through the agency UK Export Finance. The agency\u2019s funding for renewable energy developers fell at the same time. Alex Doukas, from environmental campaigner Oil Change International, said: \u201cThe EIB\u2019s proposal to end financing for fossil fuels by 2020 is a massive step forward in climate leadership. With this move, the world\u2019s largest multilateral lender is now poised to leave oil, gas and coal in the past. \u201cThe EU member states who control the bank must now stand behind the EIB\u2019s ambitious climate vision, and other financial institutions should quickly follow suit to stop funding fossils,\u201d he said. Colin Roche, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth Europe said the proposal is \u201ca crack of light in the darkness\u201d. \u201cWhile the EU and national governments are floundering as the planet burns, the EU\u2019s public bank has made the brave, correct and just proposal to stop funding fossil fuel projects. We are now urging the European Investment Bank\u2019s board to endorse this step forward, and ensure there are no loopholes for fossil fuel funding.\u201d",

The time gaps at the summit of the giant Col de l\u2019Iseran, which the Colombian crossed first, were then reflected in the overall standings, with Bernal awarded the race lead. \u201cThere was no way through,\u201d the Tour director, Christian Prudhomme, said. \u201cThey could not pass that.\u201d After the flood waters receded, the results showed that Bernal leads Alaphilippe by 48 seconds and his Ineos teammate Geraint Thomas by 1min 16sec. Eventually presented with the yellow jersey at the planned finish in Tignes, the Colombian bowed his head and wept. \u201cIt\u2019s just incredible,\u201d Bernal said. \u201cThere is a hard stage tomorrow with lots of tough climbing but I will now do everything that I can to hold on to this jersey until the race finishes in Paris.\u201d But Bernal admitted he had initially ignored the race neutralisation. \u201cI heard some words in English but I didn\u2019t really understand what they were saying,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise that they wanted us to stop. I asked them to repeat what they were saying in Spanish and it was only then that I really understood what was actually going on. \u201cI was feeling really good and when they said that I had to stop I told them: \u2018No, I\u2019m not going to.\u2019 But then they explained to me that I was the race leader and would be in the yellow jersey. I couldn\u2019t believe it and I still don\u2019t believe it. I\u2019m so happy.\u201d \u201cIt was dangerous,\u201d Dave Brailsford said of the neutralisation. \u201cWhen I saw the landslide and people running away, that was nothing to do with sport. My dad\u2019s a mountain guide. That kind of thing is dangerous.\u201d Marc Madiot, manager of Thibaut Pinot\u2019s Groupama FDJ team, agreed. \u201cThe safety of the riders is the first priority,\u201d he said. \u201cImagine if one, two or three of them had crashed and ended up in a ravine or in hospital. Then what?\u201d But Bernal was not the only rider in tears. There was a funereal atmosphere among the crowds in Tignes, more to do with Thibaut Pinot\u2019s dramatic abandonment, than the extreme weather conditions on the descent from the Iseran. Pinot\u2019s hopes of a yellow jersey ended earlier in the stage, as the Frenchman ground to a halt on the Mont\u00e9e d\u2019Aussois, crying his eyes out, and left the race. A muscle tear in his left thigh brought an end to the Frenchman\u2019s race as the gnawing fear among all French fans that his body might let him down yet again became a reality. Pinot started the stage to Tignes with his thigh strapped and had, according to his Groupama FDJ team, struggled to walk on the evening of the stage finish in Valloire. According to his sports director, Philippe Maudit, Pinot had banged the inside of his left thigh hard on the handlebars when avoiding a crash during the stage to Gap. \u201cThe pain just got worse. We thought, despite everything, he might be able to carry on but we knew it would be complicated if the race was hard,\u201d Maudit said. \u201cHe\u2019s been in pain since the start. It wasn\u2019t possible to keep riding.\u201d The fragility that caused Pinot to abandon the 2018 Giro d\u2019Italia with pneumonia, 48 hours from the finish, while third overall struck again. In seven Tour starts Pinot has finished only three. \u201cI did all I could,\u201d the Frenchman said. \u201cI believed I might have had a chance [of continuing] and that it would pass. But unfortunately it did not. I was convinced that I could possibly win the Tour but unfortunately now I will never know. It will be hard to get over this.\u201d As Pinot exited the race, the dizzying heights of the Iseran also put paid to Alaphilippe and his dream finally came to an end 38km from the finish when Bernal attacked to leave him behind. In a distance of a mere two kilometres, Bernal took back his deficit, and became the Tour\u2019s yellow jersey on the road. Even a spate of verbal self-flagellation by Alaphilippe, who swore and cursed at himself, as he struggled to keep pace, did nothing to help. Afterwards Thomas accepted his teammate\u2019s supremacy. \u201cThe main thing is we\u2019ve got the jersey in the team now,\u201d the defending champion said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a great position. We\u2019ve just got to go and finish the job off tomorrow. \u201cEgan\u2019s in yellow so the mainthing is he finishes the job. For sure he\u2019ll have a decent advantage over everyone else, so we\u2019ll fully support him now.\u201d",

Why? What is so important about the (often deeply unpleasant) human race that it needs to be continued past its evolutionary sell-by date? What gives us the right for permanence in a constantly changing universe? Any regrets about the extinction of life on Earth might be directed at non-human life, which has at least not accelerated its own demise.

Ofgem\u2019s regulation of Britain\u2019s energy networks has facilitated the huge expansion of renewable electricity generation over the last decade, and we are working with the government and other stakeholders to help decarbonise how we heat our homes, businesses and transport, particularly through electric vehicles. This month Ofgem published its new corporate vision, which set out our objective of helping decarbonise the economy at the lowest cost to consumers in support of the recently passed legislation enshrining in law the target of net zero carbon emissions for the UK by 2050. Ultimately government is responsible for setting the policy for the energy sector and proposing any changes to Ofgem\u2019s statutory framework. Dermot Nolan Chief executive, Ofgem \u2022 Ian McNicholas (Letters, 24 July) suggests we need a new home once this planet becomes uninhabitable for humans. Why? What is so important about the (often deeply unpleasant) human race that it needs to be continued past its evolutionary sell-by date? What gives us the right for permanence in a constantly changing universe? Any regrets about the extinction of life on Earth might be directed at non-human life, which has at least not accelerated its own demise. Let us not cry for the end of the human race, which exists in the blink of an eye compared with the lifespan and enormity of the universe. Given life popped up here, it will more than likely pop up elsewhere (if it has not already done so). Simon Lawton-Smith London \u2022 Elle Hunt raises valid points on rising temperatures (This isn\u2019t just a heatwave. It\u2019s an alarm call, 25 July) but there are worse concerns. As ice sheets melt, they reflect less solar energy, the exposed darker surfaces absorb more heat and previously frozen trapped gases escape. The effects spread to permafrost and could easily swamp even major reductions from human activities. If this seems over-pessimistic, consider how Arctic temperatures have recently soared despite few of the obvious sources of human emissions. One potential solution involves geoengineering to limit solar input above the poles, with some methods mimicking how debris from volcanic eruptions can block sunlight. I mentioned this option to the Department of Energy and Climate Change; they helpfully gave me more details of such methods but then, despite allowing fracking, told me the idea was too risky. Compared with what, I wonder? Iain Climie Whitchurch, Hampshire \u2022 I was glad to read that your editorial policy is now to refer to \u201cclimate emergency\u201d and not to \u201cclimate change\u201d (Open door, 17 June). Perhaps your picture editors could do the same and not use photographs of seaside fun or leisurely drinks on cafe terraces to illustrate articles about the unprecedented high temperature emergency facing us. While you\u2019re at it, you could drop the term \u201cheatwave\u201d with its benign associations of ice-creams and pub gardens.

Others accused of abuse were the former head of MI6 Sir Maurice Oldfield, the Labour peer Greville Janner and the former head of MI5 Sir Michael Hanley.</p> <p>He also fraudulently claimed \u00a322,000 in compensation for his false claims of abuse, using some of the money to put down a deposit on a Ford Mustang.</p> <p>When his story began to unravel, Beech \u2013 who admitted hoarding hundreds of child abuse images and secretly filming a teenager using the toilet in a separate case \u2013 fled to Sweden before being captured.

He told Beech he must serve half of his total sentence behind bars. The length of the sentence prompted gasps from the public gallery, while Beech stood motionless in the dock.</p> <p>In a powerful statement read on his behalf, 95-year-old Bramall \u2013 a former head of the British army \u2013 recalled the impact the \u201cmonstrous\u201d allegations had on him and his legacy.</p> <p>\u201cIn service of my Queen and country I have done all that has been required of me,\u201d Bramall said. \u201cI have suffered both physically and emotionally as a result and did so without regret or complaint. I thought I could be hurt no more. I can honestly say, however, I was never as badly wounded in all my time in the military as I have been by the allegations made by \u2018Nick\u2019 that formed the basis of Operation Midland.\u201d</p> <p>He pointed out how his elderly wife, who was confined to her bed with dementia at the time their home was raided in 2015, died without knowing he had been cleared.</p> <p>\u201cI had seen my home searched by the [Metropolitan police]; been accused of heinous sexual acts against children; been linked to people who were accused of murdering children; had my family approached by members of the press in search of information for the ongoing media frenzy; watched my children lose their mother and worry about the impact of these allegations on their father; and seen my wife pass not knowing that I had been cleared of all wrongdoing.\u201d</p> <p>The widow of the former home secretary Leon Brittan, who died in 2015 with the allegations still hanging over him, also revealed the pain of Beech\u2019s false claims, including how her children feared for her safety and that she had to hire security for her husband\u2019s burial.</p> <p>A statement read to the court on Lady Brittan\u2019s behalf by the prosecutor, Tony Badenoch QC, said: \u201cIn the last year of his life \u2013 and particularly in his last few months \u2013 he had to face, while desperately ill, a series of entirely false allegations and smears of the very worst kind.</p> <p>\u201cBefore he became the subject of heinous claims of child rape and murder by the man then known as \u2018Nick\u2019, he dealt courageously with various other entirely untrue claims of a sexual nature.</p> <p>\u201cI felt he was caught up in a totally unjustified witch hunt which took its toll on both him and me. The impact of these dreadful allegations on the entire global network of anyone caught up in such matters is indescribable, incalculable and unending.\u201d</p> <p>Proctor, accused by Beech of child rape and murdering two boys, fought back tears as he read his statement to the court. The 72-year-old former Tory MP, who said he lost his home, job and was forced to move to Spain because of the false allegations, described how he had \u201cwounds that will never heal\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHis allegations, following the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) involvement, were the worst that can be made: that I was a serial child sexual murderer, torturer and abuser,\u201d Proctor said.</p> <p>\u201cI find it extraordinary that an institution which formerly I held in high regard, the MPS, allowed itself to lend weight to such false and incredible allegations.\u201d</p> <p>A statement on behalf of Heath\u2019s godson, Lincoln Seligman, was also read in court. It said the late Tory prime minister \u201cwas always as he remains wholly and categorically innocent of these depraved and wicked accusations\u201d.</p> <p>Seligman said the \u201cplainly ridiculous\u201d allegations against his godfather \u201ccast a dreadful stain on this country\u201d.</p> <p>He also criticised the Metropolitan police and politicians who \u201cshould be ashamed of themselves\u201d for giving credence to Beech\u2019s accusations. \u201cIt is unlikely this damage will ever be undone,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Daniel Janner QC \u2013 whose late father, the Labour peer Lord Janner, was also falsely accused by Beech \u2013 told the court: \u201cIt is impossible to get over the hurt which such ghastly alleged acts of violence have on a law-abiding family like mine. They are corrosive. They lie on the internet with ignorant people saying that there is no smoke without fire.</p> <p>\u201cWe loved our late father, he never harmed anybody in his whole life. He died an innocent man, he was a force for good and justice so we fight back and we will not stop.\u201d</p> <p>Badenoch told the court: \u201cIn this case, the defendant\u2019s conduct amounted to the cynical manipulation of the criminal justice system on an unprecedented scale.\u201d</p> <p>Collingwood Thompson QC, defending, argued that Beech had not made his allegations continuously, that rather than being sophisticated his claims were \u201cincredible\u201d, and there was never a \u201crealistic prospect\u201d of proceedings starting on the basis of them.</p> <p>Beech\u2019s 18-year sentence includes 15 years concurrently for the 12 counts of perverting the course of justice, plus 18 months consecutively for his fraudulent compensation claim. In addition, he was given 18 months consecutively in relation to a separate case in which he pleaded guilty earlier this year to four counts of making indecent photographs of children, one count of possessing indecent images of children and one count of voyeurism. He was given two months concurrently for breaching bail when he absconded to Sweden.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/22/met-police-condemned-over-handing-of-vip-paedophile-ring-inquiry-carl-beech-guilty\">Scotland Yard has come under fire over</a> its handling of the Operation Midland inquiry into Beech\u2019s claims, in which the detective leading the investigation described his account as \u201ccredible and true\u201d on TV news bulletins.</p> <p>The deputy Labour leader, Tom Watson, who met Beech and encouraged him to report his allegations to the police, has also faced scrutiny for his role. Beech told the trial that Watson was part of a \u201clittle group\u201d supporting him.</p> <p>Beech had told the Metropolitan police in 2014 that his stepfather, Raymond Beech, sexually abused him and begun ferrying him to parties when he was seven where he was raped by a group of high-profile men. His claims, pushed by the discredited Exaro news agency, made headline news and featured prominently on the BBC.</p>",

In a powerful statement read on his behalf, 95-year-old Bramall \u2013 a former head of the British army \u2013 recalled the impact the \u201cmonstrous\u201d allegations had on him and his legacy. \u201cIn service of my Queen and country I have done all that has been required of me,\u201d Bramall said. \u201cI have suffered both physically and emotionally as a result and did so without regret or complaint. I thought I could be hurt no more. I can honestly say, however, I was never as badly wounded in all my time in the military as I have been by the allegations made by \u2018Nick\u2019 that formed the basis of Operation Midland.\u201d He pointed out how his elderly wife, who was confined to her bed with dementia at the time their home was raided in 2015, died without knowing he had been cleared. \u201cI had seen my home searched by the [Metropolitan police]; been accused of heinous sexual acts against children; been linked to people who were accused of murdering children; had my family approached by members of the press in search of information for the ongoing media frenzy; watched my children lose their mother and worry about the impact of these allegations on their father; and seen my wife pass not knowing that I had been cleared of all wrongdoing.\u201d The widow of the former home secretary Leon Brittan, who died in 2015 with the allegations still hanging over him, also revealed the pain of Beech\u2019s false claims, including how her children feared for her safety and that she had to hire security for her husband\u2019s burial. A statement read to the court on Lady Brittan\u2019s behalf by the prosecutor, Tony Badenoch QC, said: \u201cIn the last year of his life \u2013 and particularly in his last few months \u2013 he had to face, while desperately ill, a series of entirely false allegations and smears of the very worst kind. \u201cBefore he became the subject of heinous claims of child rape and murder by the man then known as \u2018Nick\u2019, he dealt courageously with various other entirely untrue claims of a sexual nature. \u201cI felt he was caught up in a totally unjustified witch hunt which took its toll on both him and me. The impact of these dreadful allegations on the entire global network of anyone caught up in such matters is indescribable, incalculable and unending.\u201d Proctor, accused by Beech of child rape and murdering two boys, fought back tears as he read his statement to the court. The 72-year-old former Tory MP, who said he lost his home, job and was forced to move to Spain because of the false allegations, described how he had \u201cwounds that will never heal\u201d. \u201cHis allegations, following the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) involvement, were the worst that can be made: that I was a serial child sexual murderer, torturer and abuser,\u201d Proctor said. \u201cI find it extraordinary that an institution which formerly I held in high regard, the MPS, allowed itself to lend weight to such false and incredible allegations.\u201d A statement on behalf of Heath\u2019s godson, Lincoln Seligman, was also read in court. It said the late Tory prime minister \u201cwas always as he remains wholly and categorically innocent of these depraved and wicked accusations\u201d. Seligman said the \u201cplainly ridiculous\u201d allegations against his godfather \u201ccast a dreadful stain on this country\u201d. He also criticised the Metropolitan police and politicians who \u201cshould be ashamed of themselves\u201d for giving credence to Beech\u2019s accusations. \u201cIt is unlikely this damage will ever be undone,\u201d he added. Daniel Janner QC \u2013 whose late father, the Labour peer Lord Janner, was also falsely accused by Beech \u2013 told the court: \u201cIt is impossible to get over the hurt which such ghastly alleged acts of violence have on a law-abiding family like mine. They are corrosive. They lie on the internet with ignorant people saying that there is no smoke without fire. \u201cWe loved our late father, he never harmed anybody in his whole life. He died an innocent man, he was a force for good and justice so we fight back and we will not stop.\u201d Badenoch told the court: \u201cIn this case, the defendant\u2019s conduct amounted to the cynical manipulation of the criminal justice system on an unprecedented scale.\u201d Collingwood Thompson QC, defending, argued that Beech had not made his allegations continuously, that rather than being sophisticated his claims were \u201cincredible\u201d, and there was never a \u201crealistic prospect\u201d of proceedings starting on the basis of them. Beech\u2019s 18-year sentence includes 15 years concurrently for the 12 counts of perverting the course of justice, plus 18 months consecutively for his fraudulent compensation claim. In addition, he was given 18 months consecutively in relation to a separate case in which he pleaded guilty earlier this year to four counts of making indecent photographs of children, one count of possessing indecent images of children and one count of voyeurism. He was given two months concurrently for breaching bail when he absconded to Sweden. Scotland Yard has come under fire over its handling of the Operation Midland inquiry into Beech\u2019s claims, in which the detective leading the investigation described his account as \u201ccredible and true\u201d on TV news bulletins. The deputy Labour leader, Tom Watson, who met Beech and encouraged him to report his allegations to the police, has also faced scrutiny for his role. Beech told the trial that Watson was part of a \u201clittle group\u201d supporting him. Beech had told the Metropolitan police in 2014 that his stepfather, Raymond Beech, sexually abused him and begun ferrying him to parties when he was seven where he was raped by a group of high-profile men. His claims, pushed by the discredited Exaro news agency, made headline news and featured prominently on the BBC.",

The daily deluge of disinformation produced by RT and Sputnik is a vital component of the tactics that other authoritarian regimes are seeking to replicate.</p> <p>Monitoring and measuring the output of these state-controlled broadcasters is vital to understand how hostile nations are attempting to influence audiences around the world by utilising fake news, disinformation and propaganda. A detailed analysis of the output of state-controlled media often reveals a fundamental disparity between Russian-owned outlets in the UK and the rest of Europe when comparing them to established news organisations. The volume of coverage, framing of coverage, and average engagement with that coverage is, at times, widely disparate.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Their coverage of the European elections in May focused on the success of populist parties like the Brexit party</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I\u2019m the CEO of <a href=\"https://zincnetwork.com/work\">Zinc Network</a>, a communications agency that looks at social issues including disinformation and gets some of its funding from government contracts. Our research at the State Owned Media Analytics and Research programme has shown us that RT sometimes dedicates a disproportionate amount of time to pushing certain stories \u2013 such as the coup in Venezuela or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/21/brexit-party-steven-edginton-darroch-cables\" title=\"\">leaked memos</a> from the British ambassador about Donald Trump. Why does this matter? Audiences for these channels in the UK are relatively tiny. Their online reach is dwarfed by domestic news outlets such as the Guardian, Mail Online and others. But their influence, especially on key issues, often belies their size. For example, RT\u2019s coverage on the Venezuela coup attracted an average of 2,558 engagements (retweets, likes or shares) per online article, more than the BBC\u2019s 1,780 engagements per article.</p> <p>And evidence is mounting to suggest they routinely disseminate stories designed to sow division in the west and pursue the foreign policy goals of the governments that back them, consciously or otherwise. According to a report published by the Policy Institute at King\u2019s College London, (<a href=\"https://www.kcl.ac.uk/policy-institute/research-analysis/weaponising-news\" title=\"\">Weaponising </a><a href=\"https://www.kcl.ac.uk/policy-institute/research-analysis/weaponising-news\" title=\"\">news: RT, Sputnik and </a><a href=\"https://www.kcl.ac.uk/policy-institute/research-analysis/weaponising-news\" title=\"\">disinformation</a>), RT and Sputnik distributed no fewer than seven conspiracy theories about the Skripal poisoning. The report also found that claims made by Russian state media about the country\u2019s advanced weaponry were reported as fact in UK newspapers without verification. It is difficult to demonstrate the extent to which this influences public discourse, but measuring the online activity of state media is a useful way to start.</p> <p>The methodology employed by these news organisations poses a series of questions for policymakers. If they are being used to destabilise civil society and widen social fissures, then what is the right response? They devote a disproportionate amount of coverage to stories that claim to show the divisive effects of immigration. Their coverage of the European elections in May focused on the success of populist parties like the Brexit party, while for the most part ignoring a surge in support for the Greens and other non-traditional parties on the left. Why is it that state-controlled media portrayed the results as a populist backlash against the European project, which, according to this narrative, seeks to suppress national identities and usurp nation states? Does it matter that they encourage UK citizens to question the veracity or impartiality of the news they consume from traditionally reliable sources?</p> <p>None of this is new. Media organisations have always asserted the cultural values of the organisations that own or control them. Some argue that much of the output of the BBC World Service is an exercise in soft power.

      "bodyText": "The \u00a3200,000 fine handed out by Ofcom to the TV network RT (formerly Russia Today) for repeatedly breaching impartiality rules over its coverage of the Skripal poisoning is a powerful reminder of the tactics Russia employs to manipulate public opinion in the west. The daily deluge of disinformation produced by RT and Sputnik is a vital component of the tactics that other authoritarian regimes are seeking to replicate. Monitoring and measuring the output of these state-controlled broadcasters is vital to understand how hostile nations are attempting to influence audiences around the world by utilising fake news, disinformation and propaganda. A detailed analysis of the output of state-controlled media often reveals a fundamental disparity between Russian-owned outlets in the UK and the rest of Europe when comparing them to established news organisations. The volume of coverage, framing of coverage, and average engagement with that coverage is, at times, widely disparate. I\u2019m the CEO of Zinc Network, a communications agency that looks at social issues including disinformation and gets some of its funding from government contracts. Our research at the State Owned Media Analytics and Research programme has shown us that RT sometimes dedicates a disproportionate amount of time to pushing certain stories \u2013 such as the coup in Venezuela or the leaked memos from the British ambassador about Donald Trump. Why does this matter? Audiences for these channels in the UK are relatively tiny. Their online reach is dwarfed by domestic news outlets such as the Guardian, Mail Online and others. But their influence, especially on key issues, often belies their size. For example, RT\u2019s coverage on the Venezuela coup attracted an average of 2,558 engagements (retweets, likes or shares) per online article, more than the BBC\u2019s 1,780 engagements per article. And evidence is mounting to suggest they routinely disseminate stories designed to sow division in the west and pursue the foreign policy goals of the governments that back them, consciously or otherwise. According to a report published by the Policy Institute at King\u2019s College London, (Weaponising news: RT, Sputnik and disinformation), RT and Sputnik distributed no fewer than seven conspiracy theories about the Skripal poisoning. The report also found that claims made by Russian state media about the country\u2019s advanced weaponry were reported as fact in UK newspapers without verification. It is difficult to demonstrate the extent to which this influences public discourse, but measuring the online activity of state media is a useful way to start. The methodology employed by these news organisations poses a series of questions for policymakers. If they are being used to destabilise civil society and widen social fissures, then what is the right response? They devote a disproportionate amount of coverage to stories that claim to show the divisive effects of immigration. Their coverage of the European elections in May focused on the success of populist parties like the Brexit party, while for the most part ignoring a surge in support for the Greens and other non-traditional parties on the left. Why is it that state-controlled media portrayed the results as a populist backlash against the European project, which, according to this narrative, seeks to suppress national identities and usurp nation states? Does it matter that they encourage UK citizens to question the veracity or impartiality of the news they consume from traditionally reliable sources? None of this is new. Media organisations have always asserted the cultural values of the organisations that own or control them. Some argue that much of the output of the BBC World Service is an exercise in soft power. Like the overwhelming majority of its consumers, the BBC takes it for granted that democracy is a \u201cgood thing\u201d and seeks to promote it. But the BBC is publicly funded, not government-controlled \u2013 that is a clear distinction. Government might, and does, seek to exert pressure \u2013 but it cannot dictate an editorial line. The same cannot be said of Russia Today, China Daily, Iran\u2019s Press TV or the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRC), which operates in a democratic country that is becoming more illiberal by the day. States will always use all the tools at their disposal to protect their national interests and pursue foreign policy objectives. But if the modus operandi of state-controlled media is to delegitimise institutions and sources of authority in the eyes of a section of the wider public, undermine social cohesion by amplifying divisive voices, draw attention to examples of western hypocrisy, and promote narratives of fear and uncertainty, then how do we respond? Disinformation does not consist solely of fabricated news stories, Photoshopped images or wild conspiracy theories presented as fact. It is often more nuanced, more sophisticated \u2013 and more effective \u2013 than policymakers or the public realise. Only by monitoring and measuring their influence can we develop strategies to counter their growing power and reach. \u2022 Robert Elliott is the CEO of Zinc Network, a strategic communications agency tackling complex social issues, including disinformation",

His titles were won during the blown diffuser period of 2010-2011 and then when it was banned, Red Bull maintained their advantage by clever channelling of exhaust gasses in 2012-2013.

Admittedly The Man suggested your favourite satirical teatimely email attend an intensive comedy workshop during June, while muttering something about nobody wanting to read the same tired old gags every day, but to be honest The Fiver wasn\u2019t listening properly. It was too busy preparing for a couple of months sitting on the sofa, drinking Purple Tin and thinking about anything but football. There was some cricket on, see, and some tennis, plus a bit of cycling, and none of it was going to watch itself. So you can shove your four-week intensive comedy workshop! Hic! Naturally, The Fiver will be back in tip-top shape come the start of the season. In fact it could probably just wing it. But not everyone can switch the genius on and off so effortlessly.

I hope the victim is getting all the support she needs through this dreadful time. It is completely unacceptable that she has had suffer this awful behaviour,\u201d Millen-Bamford said. Gareth Arnold, O\u2019Mara\u2019s most recent communications chief, resigned using the MP\u2019s own Twitter account on Tuesday night, accusing him of failing his constituents and being \u201cselfish\u201d and \u201cdegenerate\u201d. Yet by Thursday afternoon O\u2019Mara appeared to have forgiven him, saying in his statement: \u201cTo my dear, old friend \u2013 the Noel to my Liam \u2013 Gareth: Thank you for sticking with me like I am sticking with you.\u201d O\u2019Mara was selected to stand as a Labour MP in the snap general election of June 2017 by Labour\u2019s national executive committee, bypassing local party members. By October 2017, he had been suspended over a string of homophobic and misogynistic tweets he had written before his election. In July 2018, he quit the party to stand as an independent and has accused Labour \u2013 and particularly Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 of bullying him. But Labour insisted the party had offered O\u2019Mara support. A spokesman said: \u201cWe take the welfare of our MPs very seriously and, while Jared is no longer a Labour MP, we are concerned for his welfare and we have continued to provide support to him, and will continue to do so.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s 1969, and Los Angeles doesn\u2019t look like it used to. Psychedelic flyers wallpaper the telephone poles advertising love-ins and happenings, dirty pictures have started getting proper red carpet premieres and storefronts tout ever-more-sophisticated TV sets. The strong, silent types that used to people the streets have been replaced by druggies and weirdos. Quentin Tarantino\u2019s latest film, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, wedges itself between a fading past and the future toward which it rapidly hurtles, training its camera on a few characters caught in the crossfire. The audience can perceive the vicissitudes of the years in a microcosmic form with just one moment, too, in the clothing, music and production design.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/18/quentin-tarantino-final-film-theories-rumors\">Quentin unchained: what will Tarantino's 10th and final film be?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>California set the scene for the social upheavals of the counterculture era, when surfaces offered a simple and immediate way to tell the establishment squares apart from the free-loving, free-spirited youth. These groups, the generational ideals they symbolize and their collision all hover around the film\u2019s central theme, with Tarantino triangulating the turning point between the old and new. He communicates these ideas through their choices in scenery, props and garb that identifies a person as a member of one cultural camp or the other. In the entertainment industry, where appearance means everything and being seen by the public as pass\u00e9 represents a fate worse than death, looking the part can mean the difference between success and failure.</p> <p>Rick Dalton, the journeyman actor portrayed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/22/leonardo-dicaprio-baikal-lake-siberia-instagram-appeals-to-save\">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>, worries he may have an image problem. A staple of TV serials during the 50s now facing obsolescence as tastes morph, he is scraping by on guest spots casting him as a novelty, a reference to himself. The film joins him as he prepares for once such gig, pairing a leather jacket the color of chocolate milk with a rotation of polyester turtlenecks. It\u2019s tough guy attire with a bit of actorly flair, precisely the sort of thing a man would wear to set to let his castmates know he\u2019s a performer, but he\u2019s no sissy. There\u2019s a thin gold chain to go with this ensemble, and one gets the sense that it\u2019s Rick\u2019s lone concession to the fashion trends drifting toward the flamboyant and ostentatious.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5cc8e11e7ae3aee88def0085f94014d45e8d6465\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5cc8e11e7ae3aee88def0085f94014d45e8d6465/0_0_1800_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Cooper/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rick gets a talking-to early on from a talent agent (Al Pacino) warning him that obscurity awaits unless he catches up with the times and jet-sets to Italy for a new career in so-called \u201cspaghetti westerns\u201d. He gives in near the end of the film\u2019s second act, at which point the script jumps ahead six months and finds Rick transformed. His sojourn in <em>cinema Italia</em> brings him into his own present; on the plane home, Tarantino drops in a glorious reveal shot panning up over Rick\u2019s newly grown sideburns and his neckerchief, announcing him as a new man with his finger on the pulse. He\u2019s adapting, and that starts with his image \u2013 he brings back a new Italian wife to his Hollywood home, the pride and joy that he sees as an un-severable tie to the A-list.</p> <p>For contrast with Rick\u2019s resistance to his own aging, Phillips outfitted the many hippies with loose, skimpy, skin-baring clothes to emphasize the unbothered freedom these burnouts enjoy. Rick barks that he hates hippies as he and his stunt double/driver/best pal, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), drive by a gaggle in tie-dye and denim. One of them gets more to do than the others, a smiley sexpot named Pussycat played by Margaret Qualley. She spends the film in mini denim shorts, a crocheted halter top and bare feet \u2013 Tarantino\u2019s camera, unsurprisingly, loves her. They rove around doing not much of anything, just selling LSD-dipped cigarettes and scouring dumpsters for free food. Their behavior baffles, frightens and enrages Rick.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELeMaP8EPAA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ELeMaP8EPAA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Tarantino\u2019s film draws a clear dichotomy between the old guard embodied by Rick and the kids coming up from behind, which leaves Cliff in a curious middle ground. He\u2019s a tougher character to read; aloof and easygoing, he\u2019s more amenable to hippies, while still a part of Rick\u2019s generation. Cliff starts the film embracing the new aesthetics, already having grown sideburns and rocking a Canadian tuxedo. But his most significant look, the <a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Once-Upon-A-Time-In...-Hollywood-Poster-0f6c.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;zoom=1&amp;resize=644,954&amp;ssl=1\">poster-friendly</a> one, deals him a faded T-shirt and open Hawaiian shirt to go with it. It\u2019s an emblem of taking it easy, of not caring about whether it comes off as tacky or cool. (Which, incidentally, is the key to pulling it off.) That\u2019s Cliff in a nutshell, drifting through his life and his time, more open-minded than his contemporaries and not entirely trustful of the young guns.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/21/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-review-tarantino-dazzling-dicaprio-pitt\">Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood review - Tarantino's dazzling LA redemption song</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood takes epochal changeover as its primary focus, clocking the beginning of one era as it kills the one that came before.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s 1969, and Los Angeles doesn\u2019t look like it used to. Psychedelic flyers wallpaper the telephone poles advertising love-ins and happenings, dirty pictures have started getting proper red carpet premieres and storefronts tout ever-more-sophisticated TV sets. The strong, silent types that used to people the streets have been replaced by druggies and weirdos. Quentin Tarantino\u2019s latest film, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, wedges itself between a fading past and the future toward which it rapidly hurtles, training its camera on a few characters caught in the crossfire. The audience can perceive the vicissitudes of the years in a microcosmic form with just one moment, too, in the clothing, music and production design. California set the scene for the social upheavals of the counterculture era, when surfaces offered a simple and immediate way to tell the establishment squares apart from the free-loving, free-spirited youth. These groups, the generational ideals they symbolize and their collision all hover around the film\u2019s central theme, with Tarantino triangulating the turning point between the old and new. He communicates these ideas through their choices in scenery, props and garb that identifies a person as a member of one cultural camp or the other. In the entertainment industry, where appearance means everything and being seen by the public as pass\u00e9 represents a fate worse than death, looking the part can mean the difference between success and failure. Rick Dalton, the journeyman actor portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio, worries he may have an image problem. A staple of TV serials during the 50s now facing obsolescence as tastes morph, he is scraping by on guest spots casting him as a novelty, a reference to himself. The film joins him as he prepares for once such gig, pairing a leather jacket the color of chocolate milk with a rotation of polyester turtlenecks. It\u2019s tough guy attire with a bit of actorly flair, precisely the sort of thing a man would wear to set to let his castmates know he\u2019s a performer, but he\u2019s no sissy. There\u2019s a thin gold chain to go with this ensemble, and one gets the sense that it\u2019s Rick\u2019s lone concession to the fashion trends drifting toward the flamboyant and ostentatious. Rick gets a talking-to early on from a talent agent (Al Pacino) warning him that obscurity awaits unless he catches up with the times and jet-sets to Italy for a new career in so-called \u201cspaghetti westerns\u201d. He gives in near the end of the film\u2019s second act, at which point the script jumps ahead six months and finds Rick transformed. His sojourn in cinema Italia brings him into his own present; on the plane home, Tarantino drops in a glorious reveal shot panning up over Rick\u2019s newly grown sideburns and his neckerchief, announcing him as a new man with his finger on the pulse. He\u2019s adapting, and that starts with his image \u2013 he brings back a new Italian wife to his Hollywood home, the pride and joy that he sees as an un-severable tie to the A-list. For contrast with Rick\u2019s resistance to his own aging, Phillips outfitted the many hippies with loose, skimpy, skin-baring clothes to emphasize the unbothered freedom these burnouts enjoy. Rick barks that he hates hippies as he and his stunt double/driver/best pal, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), drive by a gaggle in tie-dye and denim. One of them gets more to do than the others, a smiley sexpot named Pussycat played by Margaret Qualley. She spends the film in mini denim shorts, a crocheted halter top and bare feet \u2013 Tarantino\u2019s camera, unsurprisingly, loves her. They rove around doing not much of anything, just selling LSD-dipped cigarettes and scouring dumpsters for free food. Their behavior baffles, frightens and enrages Rick. Tarantino\u2019s film draws a clear dichotomy between the old guard embodied by Rick and the kids coming up from behind, which leaves Cliff in a curious middle ground. He\u2019s a tougher character to read; aloof and easygoing, he\u2019s more amenable to hippies, while still a part of Rick\u2019s generation. Cliff starts the film embracing the new aesthetics, already having grown sideburns and rocking a Canadian tuxedo. But his most significant look, the poster-friendly one, deals him a faded T-shirt and open Hawaiian shirt to go with it. It\u2019s an emblem of taking it easy, of not caring about whether it comes off as tacky or cool. (Which, incidentally, is the key to pulling it off.) That\u2019s Cliff in a nutshell, drifting through his life and his time, more open-minded than his contemporaries and not entirely trustful of the young guns. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood takes epochal changeover as its primary focus, clocking the beginning of one era as it kills the one that came before. My review out of the Cannes film festival focused on how the film fits into Tarantino\u2019s filmography as a palpably late-phase work, offering an artist getting along in years the chance to reflect on a world that\u2019s changing all around him. One could venture that he shares Rick\u2019s unease with his time, a sudden unfamiliarity with the terrain over which he once presided as king \u2013 the unsettling feeling of looking around and not recognizing anyone anymore. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is out in the US now and in the UK on 14 August",

She conceived a show that would pay tribute to the culture of historically black colleges and universities. Having just given birth to twins, she worked for months on the exacting choreography and arrangements. And she went on a demanding vegan diet that also eschewed sugar, carbs, dairy and alcohol. \u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d she says in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/18/homecoming-beyonce-review-documentary-is-a-triumphant-celebration\">behind-the-scenes documentary Homecoming</a>. This, we\u2019re given to understand, is a cautionary tale \u2013 she did not wake up like this. \u201cI definitely pushed myself further than I knew I could,\u201d she admits, \u201cand I learned a very valuable lesson: I will never, ever push myself that far again.\u201d</p> <p>Except that Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 along with an \u201cexercise physiologist\u201d and founding CEO of a \u201cplant-based lifestyle solutions company\u201d named Marco Borges \u2013 are now selling the diet she followed to prepare for her Coachella set. She has posted a video promoting the \u201cBeyonc\u00e9\u2019s Kitchen\u201d meal plan to her YouTube channel. It opens with footage from day one of her Homecoming preparations, the sight of her feet on the scale, weight 79.3kgs (12st7lb). In voiceover, she admits: \u201cEvery woman\u2019s nightmare \u2026 long way to go.

Borges tells her dancers about the power of vegetables. \u201cWhen you\u2019re eating plant-based, you will definitely have more energy.\u201d He gets a FaceTime call from Beyonc\u00e9: \u201cGuess who fits in the One Woman costume!\u201d she says, twirling in a sequinned bodice that reveals her taut, hourglass figure. \u201cThank you. It\u2019s a very big deal. She\u2019s coming back. I\u2019m coming back.\u201d</p> <p>For $14 a month, or $99 (\u00a379) a year, all this can be yours. Except it can\u2019t, because Beyonc\u00e9 is selling a lie. The performance of physical perfection is part of her job, and she has an expensive team of trainers, chefs and nannies to help her achieve it that isn\u2019t included in the subscription fee. This much we know. We also know that crash dieting seldom results in keeping weight off long-term, and that society\u2019s insistence on new mums losing \u201cpost-baby\u201d weight is nonsense. But when looking for any shred of information that might help one lose weight, reason is easily overruled.</p> <p>Aged nine, you can read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jacquelinewilson\">Jacqueline Wilson</a>\u2019s Girls in Love, about a teenager who worries she is overweight, and feel frustrated that Wilson doesn\u2019t give you the figures to measure yourself against. Age 12, you can feel soothed when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/helenfielding\">Helen Fielding</a> gives you that yardstick in Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary. Later, you understand why Wilson redacted the figures, and realise what Jones considered fat was nothing of the sort. Even when you know from a lifetime\u2019s experience the consequences of restrictive eating, you can still have your interest piqued by meeting someone who claims a juice \u201ccleanse\u201d really worked for them. You can know that muscles need time to repair following exercise, yet still work out twice a day on consecutive days in the hope of shedding an extra ounce.</p> <p>Beyonc\u00e9 is capitalising on this susceptibility. It\u2019s not the first time \u2013 in 2006, she discussed the extreme liquid diet she went on to prepare for a role in Dreamgirls, and it was a dangerously easy concoction anyone could knock up at home. Her new meal plan is less accessible, but her profiting from the tools of crash dieting suggests a woman grossly out of touch: exploiting impressionable fans by hawking them an unmatchable ideal, a move at odds with our contemporary insistence on body positivity \u2013 an ethos she has also stoked \u2013 and the evils of diet culture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bab9a04f14b91ca1514c39e92d658252127c61cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bab9a04f14b91ca1514c39e92d658252127c61cc/0_339_1957_1173/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I am still trying to understand what makes young women go to war with themselves\u2019 ...

Hearing her describe her weight as \u201cevery woman\u2019s nightmare\u201d is shocking. We are no longer supposed to talk about bodies that way. To aspire to thinness is equated with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/sep/03/diet-advice-and-tiny-seats-how-to-avoid-10-forms-of-fatphobia\">fatphobia</a>, lapsed feminism and shilling for the patriarchy. Even <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/magazine/weight-watchers-oprah-losing-it-in-the-anti-dieting-age.html\">Weight Watchers rebranded</a>, eliminating the language of dieting from its plans. It\u2019s the bad place. But so is feeling as if you don\u2019t live up to society\u2019s ideals, and still desiring thinness despite knowing it is ethically and medically suspect.</p> <p>I have spent my life stuck between the two, hating myself for wanting it and for never being able to achieve it. It is no comfort to learn that Beyonc\u00e9 feels the same way. \u201cShe\u2019s coming back, I\u2019m coming back,\u201d she says in the video, echoing the socially sanctioned lie that our lives can finally begin once we fit into those shorts stuffed down the back of the wardrobe.</p> <p>No matter how dispiriting, Beyonc\u00e9 verbalising her feelings is a start. Slowly, famous women are challenging these standards. \u201cI learned to stop hating every ounce of fat on my body,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a26628467/taylor-swift-30th-birthday-lessons/\">Taylor Swift wrote for Elle</a>. \u201cI worked hard to retrain my brain that a little extra weight means curves, shinier hair and more energy.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/florence-welch-on-addiction-and-sobriety\">In an essay for Vogue</a>, Florence Welch examined her eating disorder and tendency towards self-destruction. \u201cI am still trying to understand what makes young women go to war with themselves,\u201d she wrote.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/mar/06/sign-up-for-the-sleeve-notes-email\">Sign up for the Sleeve Notes email: music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s a battle on both fronts: an internal civil war, and an external resistance against the constant assault of messaging that valorises smallness, keeps women hungry to limit their potential and makes us complicit in promoting that message \u2013 spies in the house of self-love. On Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/dec/13/beyonce-album-first-review\">self-titled 2013 album</a>, she sang about the price of perfection, a standard fiercely instilled in her as a child by her domineering father. Uncomfortably, it\u2019s one that our idolatry may also have entrenched.</p> <p>Voices such as those of Welch and Swift can help us start to examine and unravel these dynamics, though it will never be a fair fight \u2013 self-loathing being the perpetual heavyweight to bantam optimism. Beyonc\u00e9 is the rare person who can overcome the noise of a growling stomach and conflicted mind to reach her full potential. For the rest of us, even clearing the mental path to get there will require a level of energy and determination that a restrictive diet simply can\u2019t provide, whatever Marco Borges says.</p>",

This, we\u2019re given to understand, is a cautionary tale \u2013 she did not wake up like this. \u201cI definitely pushed myself further than I knew I could,\u201d she admits, \u201cand I learned a very valuable lesson: I will never, ever push myself that far again.\u201d Except that Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 along with an \u201cexercise physiologist\u201d and founding CEO of a \u201cplant-based lifestyle solutions company\u201d named Marco Borges \u2013 are now selling the diet she followed to prepare for her Coachella set. She has posted a video promoting the \u201cBeyonc\u00e9\u2019s Kitchen\u201d meal plan to her YouTube channel. It opens with footage from day one of her Homecoming preparations, the sight of her feet on the scale, weight 79.3kgs (12st7lb). In voiceover, she admits: \u201cEvery woman\u2019s nightmare \u2026 long way to go. Let\u2019s get it.\u201d We see her dancing, doing battle ropes, sit-ups, intensive stretching and squatting in resistance bands. Borges tells her dancers about the power of vegetables. \u201cWhen you\u2019re eating plant-based, you will definitely have more energy.\u201d He gets a FaceTime call from Beyonc\u00e9: \u201cGuess who fits in the One Woman costume!\u201d she says, twirling in a sequinned bodice that reveals her taut, hourglass figure. \u201cThank you. It\u2019s a very big deal. She\u2019s coming back. I\u2019m coming back.\u201d For $14 a month, or $99 (\u00a379) a year, all this can be yours. Except it can\u2019t, because Beyonc\u00e9 is selling a lie. The performance of physical perfection is part of her job, and she has an expensive team of trainers, chefs and nannies to help her achieve it that isn\u2019t included in the subscription fee. This much we know. We also know that crash dieting seldom results in keeping weight off long-term, and that society\u2019s insistence on new mums losing \u201cpost-baby\u201d weight is nonsense. But when looking for any shred of information that might help one lose weight, reason is easily overruled. Aged nine, you can read Jacqueline Wilson\u2019s Girls in Love, about a teenager who worries she is overweight, and feel frustrated that Wilson doesn\u2019t give you the figures to measure yourself against. Age 12, you can feel soothed when Helen Fielding gives you that yardstick in Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary. Later, you understand why Wilson redacted the figures, and realise what Jones considered fat was nothing of the sort. Even when you know from a lifetime\u2019s experience the consequences of restrictive eating, you can still have your interest piqued by meeting someone who claims a juice \u201ccleanse\u201d really worked for them. You can know that muscles need time to repair following exercise, yet still work out twice a day on consecutive days in the hope of shedding an extra ounce. Beyonc\u00e9 is capitalising on this susceptibility. It\u2019s not the first time \u2013 in 2006, she discussed the extreme liquid diet she went on to prepare for a role in Dreamgirls, and it was a dangerously easy concoction anyone could knock up at home. Her new meal plan is less accessible, but her profiting from the tools of crash dieting suggests a woman grossly out of touch: exploiting impressionable fans by hawking them an unmatchable ideal, a move at odds with our contemporary insistence on body positivity \u2013 an ethos she has also stoked \u2013 and the evils of diet culture. But perhaps this is also Beyonc\u00e9 at her most human. Hearing her describe her weight as \u201cevery woman\u2019s nightmare\u201d is shocking. We are no longer supposed to talk about bodies that way. To aspire to thinness is equated with fatphobia, lapsed feminism and shilling for the patriarchy. Even Weight Watchers rebranded, eliminating the language of dieting from its plans. It\u2019s the bad place. But so is feeling as if you don\u2019t live up to society\u2019s ideals, and still desiring thinness despite knowing it is ethically and medically suspect. I have spent my life stuck between the two, hating myself for wanting it and for never being able to achieve it. It is no comfort to learn that Beyonc\u00e9 feels the same way. \u201cShe\u2019s coming back, I\u2019m coming back,\u201d she says in the video, echoing the socially sanctioned lie that our lives can finally begin once we fit into those shorts stuffed down the back of the wardrobe. No matter how dispiriting, Beyonc\u00e9 verbalising her feelings is a start. Slowly, famous women are challenging these standards. \u201cI learned to stop hating every ounce of fat on my body,\u201d Taylor Swift wrote for Elle. \u201cI worked hard to retrain my brain that a little extra weight means curves, shinier hair and more energy.\u201d In an essay for Vogue, Florence Welch examined her eating disorder and tendency towards self-destruction. \u201cI am still trying to understand what makes young women go to war with themselves,\u201d she wrote. It\u2019s a battle on both fronts: an internal civil war, and an external resistance against the constant assault of messaging that valorises smallness, keeps women hungry to limit their potential and makes us complicit in promoting that message \u2013 spies in the house of self-love. On Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s self-titled 2013 album, she sang about the price of perfection, a standard fiercely instilled in her as a child by her domineering father. Uncomfortably, it\u2019s one that our idolatry may also have entrenched. Voices such as those of Welch and Swift can help us start to examine and unravel these dynamics, though it will never be a fair fight \u2013 self-loathing being the perpetual heavyweight to bantam optimism. Beyonc\u00e9 is the rare person who can overcome the noise of a growling stomach and conflicted mind to reach her full potential. For the rest of us, even clearing the mental path to get there will require a level of energy and determination that a restrictive diet simply can\u2019t provide, whatever Marco Borges says.",

      "bodyText": "Homes in the south of England could face the country\u2019s first hosepipe ban since 2012 due to falling river water levels in Hampshire. Southern Water, which supplies 2.3 million customers, applied to the Environment Agency for a drought permit amid soaring temperatures across the UK this week. It said water levels in local rivers were low and likely to fall further after a dry winter and an even drier spring. Rainfall across the south and south-east was only three-quarters of the average recorded for winter. In May, there was less than 40% of average rainfall in Hampshire, Southern Water said. If the permit is granted, a temporary use ban may be introduced for parts of Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, one year after north-west England narrowly avoided a hosepipe ban after the longest heatwave since 1976. Privately owned Southern Water has applied for the permit because it hopes to be given permission to drain more than usual from the River Test in Hampshire, even though water levels are dwindling. If its request is successful, Southern Water would be obliged to ban the use of hosepipes to water lawns, or pressure washers to clean cars or patios, to avoid extra stress on the river\u2019s ecosystem.

      "body": "<p>Just a matter of days into his tenure in Downing Street, and it\u2019s clear Boris Johnson will have a very different approach to Theresa May. Here are 10 things we have learned so far.</p> <h2>No time for wets</h2> <p>Margaret Thatcher\u2019s first cabinet was well-stocked with Tory \u201cwets\u201d who were sceptical about her radical economic policies, and with whom she fought a series of running battles.</p> <p>With less than 100 days to go until the Brexit deadline, and after three years of bitter internecine wrangling at the top table in Downing Street, Johnson has decided to go all out \u2013 and that meant a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/25/boris-johnson-new-cabinet-prime-minister-ministerial-party-country\">wholesale purge</a> of any ministers who might harbour doubts.</p> <p>Quite a few Brexit wets \u2013 Philip Hammond, David Gauke and Rory Stewart \u2013 had already dispatched themselves into exile on the backbenches \u2013 but Johnson sent plenty more to join them. So much for his pledge to unify the party.</p> <h2>He isn\u2019t going to change his style</h2> <p>The Boris Johnson on display during the Conservative leadership campaign was more self-disciplined and less dishevelled than his colleagues were accustomed to.</p> <p>But since he clinched victory, his trademark attention-seeking quips have crept in once again \u2013 most jarringly, when he promised the audience at the results event in Westminster: \u201cDude, we\u2019re going to energise the country!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to change him,\u201d one senior aide shrugged afterwards.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s free-and-easy use of language has often landed him in trouble, but he defended his approach during the campaign, conceding that sometimes \u201cplaster comes off the ceiling\u201d because of his remarks \u2013 but \u201cI will continue to speak as directly as I can.\u201d</p> <h2>The first lady is on the team</h2> <p>Johnson\u2019s relationship with his partner, Carrie Symonds, had been in some doubt since the Guardian revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/21/police-called-to-loud-altercation-at-boris-johnsons-home\">police had been called</a> to the flat they shared after a raucous late-night row.</p> <p>Unlike Philip with Theresa May, Symonds did not accompany the new prime minister to Buckingham Palace for his audience with the Queen on Wednesday \u2013 but she was awaiting him outside No 10, alongside key members of his team.</p> <p>It has emerged that the pair recently bought a house in Camberwell \u2013 but the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman confirmed on Friday that Symonds would move into the Downing Street flat with Johnson next week.</p> <h2>All roads lead to an election</h2> <p>Even before Johnson\u2019s arrival in Downing Street, it was hard to see a route through the Brexit morass that did not end with the new prime minister going to the polls to ask for his own electoral mandate.</p> <p>But since he arrived in No 10, his resolutely tough rhetoric on the \u201canti-democratic\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/15/what-is-the-brexit-backstop\">Irish backstop</a> appears to have knocked out the \u201clipstick on a pig\u201d scenario, which would have seen him negotiate modest changes to Theresa May\u2019s deal and then bring it back to parliament.</p> <p>Instead, many MPs on both sides of the political spectrum believe he is now engaged in little more than a diplomatic charade, after which he will accuse Brussels of intransigence, and trigger a general election.</p> <p>The arrival of the Vote Leave strategist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/26/dominic-cummings-a-career-psychopath-in-downing-street\">Dominic Cummings</a> in Downing Street, and the inclusion of a string of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/25/boris-johnson-first-speech-as-pm-what-is-he-promising\">voter-friendly pledges</a> in Johnson\u2019s first speeches, only increased that speculation.</p> <h2>The old Vote Leave gang are back together</h2> <p>The impression of a campaign government has increased after Cummings\u2019 appointment was followed by the arrival of a series of other <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/24/boris-johnson-brexiters-government-no-one-else-to-blame\">Vote Leave alumni</a> into Downing Street.</p> <p>At least five former former Vote Leave staff are part of the new Downing Street team, including Johnson\u2019s two most senior communications advisers.</p> <p>And while Johnson\u2019s double act with Michael Gove in the campaign did not end well \u2013 Gove torpedoed Johnson\u2019s 2016 leadership bid by standing himself \u2013 Gove has also been brought onboard, put in charge of no-deal planning in a non-portfolio cabinet role.</p> <h2>He\u2019s not trying to placate Brussels</h2> <p>Johnson might have already exchanged personal phone numbers with the European commission boss, Jean-Claude Juncker, but that does not mean dates are in the diary for extensive official talks.</p> <p>The new PM\u2019s stance is that while he will be \u201cenergetic and front-footed\u201d in seeking a deal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/26/brexit-deadlock-as-no-10-insists-eu-must-scrap-backstop-before-talks\">talks can only begin</a> under the terms that the existing withdrawal agreement is torn up, including the Irish backstop.</p> <p>Given that the EU has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/26/france-warns-boris-johnson-not-to-play-games-with-irish-border\">repeatedly said this cannot happen</a>, it would seem to herald an impasse, one leading \u2013 unless blocked by the Commons \u2013 to a no-deal Brexit on 31 October.</p> <h2>He really, really wants us to believe in the bin bags</h2> <p>One of the standout moments in Rory Stewart\u2019s ill-fated campaign for No 10 was when he compared his rivals\u2019 defiant optimism about Brexit to a man trying to cram three bags of rubbish in in an impossibly-full dustbin while yelling, \u201cBelieve in the bin bags!\u201d</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s promise to prove \u201cthe doubters, the doomsters, the gloomsters\u201d wrong, and his claim that \u201cno one in the last few centuries has succeeded in betting against the pluck and nerve and ambition of this country\u201d, is in exactly that vein.</p> <p>In the House of Commons on Thursday, he was also keen to criticise

      "bodyText": "Just a matter of days into his tenure in Downing Street, and it\u2019s clear Boris Johnson will have a very different approach to Theresa May. Here are 10 things we have learned so far. No time for wets Margaret Thatcher\u2019s first cabinet was well-stocked with Tory \u201cwets\u201d who were sceptical about her radical economic policies, and with whom she fought a series of running battles. With less than 100 days to go until the Brexit deadline, and after three years of bitter internecine wrangling at the top table in Downing Street, Johnson has decided to go all out \u2013 and that meant a wholesale purge of any ministers who might harbour doubts. Quite a few Brexit wets \u2013 Philip Hammond, David Gauke and Rory Stewart \u2013 had already dispatched themselves into exile on the backbenches \u2013 but Johnson sent plenty more to join them. So much for his pledge to unify the party. He isn\u2019t going to change his style The Boris Johnson on display during the Conservative leadership campaign was more self-disciplined and less dishevelled than his colleagues were accustomed to. But since he clinched victory, his trademark attention-seeking quips have crept in once again \u2013 most jarringly, when he promised the audience at the results event in Westminster: \u201cDude, we\u2019re going to energise the country!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not going to change him,\u201d one senior aide shrugged afterwards. Johnson\u2019s free-and-easy use of language has often landed him in trouble, but he defended his approach during the campaign, conceding that sometimes \u201cplaster comes off the ceiling\u201d because of his remarks \u2013 but \u201cI will continue to speak as directly as I can.\u201d The first lady is on the team Johnson\u2019s relationship with his partner, Carrie Symonds, had been in some doubt since the Guardian revealed that police had been called to the flat they shared after a raucous late-night row. Unlike Philip with Theresa May, Symonds did not accompany the new prime minister to Buckingham Palace for his audience with the Queen on Wednesday \u2013 but she was awaiting him outside No 10, alongside key members of his team. It has emerged that the pair recently bought a house in Camberwell \u2013 but the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman confirmed on Friday that Symonds would move into the Downing Street flat with Johnson next week. All roads lead to an election Even before Johnson\u2019s arrival in Downing Street, it was hard to see a route through the Brexit morass that did not end with the new prime minister going to the polls to ask for his own electoral mandate. But since he arrived in No 10, his resolutely tough rhetoric on the \u201canti-democratic\u201d Irish backstop appears to have knocked out the \u201clipstick on a pig\u201d scenario, which would have seen him negotiate modest changes to Theresa May\u2019s deal and then bring it back to parliament. Instead, many MPs on both sides of the political spectrum believe he is now engaged in little more than a diplomatic charade, after which he will accuse Brussels of intransigence, and trigger a general election. The arrival of the Vote Leave strategist Dominic Cummings in Downing Street, and the inclusion of a string of voter-friendly pledges in Johnson\u2019s first speeches, only increased that speculation. The old Vote Leave gang are back together The impression of a campaign government has increased after Cummings\u2019 appointment was followed by the arrival of a series of other Vote Leave alumni into Downing Street. At least five former former Vote Leave staff are part of the new Downing Street team, including Johnson\u2019s two most senior communications advisers. And while Johnson\u2019s double act with Michael Gove in the campaign did not end well \u2013 Gove torpedoed Johnson\u2019s 2016 leadership bid by standing himself \u2013 Gove has also been brought onboard, put in charge of no-deal planning in a non-portfolio cabinet role. He\u2019s not trying to placate Brussels Johnson might have already exchanged personal phone numbers with the European commission boss, Jean-Claude Juncker, but that does not mean dates are in the diary for extensive official talks. The new PM\u2019s stance is that while he will be \u201cenergetic and front-footed\u201d in seeking a deal, talks can only begin under the terms that the existing withdrawal agreement is torn up, including the Irish backstop. Given that the EU has repeatedly said this cannot happen, it would seem to herald an impasse, one leading \u2013 unless blocked by the Commons \u2013 to a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. He really, really wants us to believe in the bin bags One of the standout moments in Rory Stewart\u2019s ill-fated campaign for No 10 was when he compared his rivals\u2019 defiant optimism about Brexit to a man trying to cram three bags of rubbish in in an impossibly-full dustbin while yelling, \u201cBelieve in the bin bags!\u201d Johnson\u2019s promise to prove \u201cthe doubters, the doomsters, the gloomsters\u201d wrong, and his claim that \u201cno one in the last few centuries has succeeded in betting against the pluck and nerve and ambition of this country\u201d, is in exactly that vein. In the House of Commons on Thursday, he was also keen to criticise the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 and quite a few of the MPs who asked questions of him \u2013 for being insufficiently optimistic, or resolute. But not all the Brexit Spartans are definitely onboard The head of the Brexit-ultra European Research Group, Jacob Rees-Mogg, might be safely in the cabinet, but that does not mean Johnson has all the die-hards on side. Steve Baker, one of their leading number, turned down a junior minister\u2019s role, saying he did not want to return to the \u201cpowerlessness\u201d of a previous role, while another, Mark Francois, has already warned Johnson his feet will be held to the fire in ditching all the current withdrawal agreement. The spending taps are now open (in theory) Johnson looks set to push ahead with the lavish spending plans outlined in his campaign, starting with a pledge to recruit 20,000 new police officers. Asked if the official policy is still to reduce the deficit, No 10 now says this is \u201cunder review\u201d. The important caveat is that many observers believe the spending and tax cut plans are aimed at an autumn election and might well never happen \u2013 particularly in the current parliament. There could be a No 10 dog Potentially bad news for Larry the Downing Street cat \u2013 or perhaps for the dog, given Larry\u2019s proven ability to defend his territory \u2013 but it seems there might be a new animal arriving. Addressing Downing Street staff, Johnson made a joke about improving relations between Larry and the Foreign Office cat, Palmerston, before asking, seemingly off the cuff, whether people would like a resident canine as well. Yes, came the shouted response. If it happens, we are told it will be a rescue dog, co-owned by Johnson and his partner, Carrie Symonds. There could even be two dogs if the chancellor, Sajid Javid, brings his family\u2019s dog with him.",

      "bodyText": "Pangloss or Cassandra: is the world economy doing just fine or about to seriously hit the buffers? The views of economists are varied, and the spread of opinion on what central banks should do about it is even broader. But like with the European Central Bank yesterday, hawks and doves alike have something to play with after today\u2019s US GDP release, which showed that the US economy slowed down, but slower than expected. The American consumer delivered the economy from further deceleration, but business investment fell. The mixed picture should leave the way open for the Federal Reserve to go ahead with rate cuts next week, economists said. James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, an investment bank, said: We expect the Federal Reserve to pull the trigger on a precautionary 25 basis point rate cut next Wednesday with a further 25 basis point move likely in September. The market continues to look for four rate cuts in total by the end of 2020, but we believe the catalyst for such action would have to be a significant ratcheting up in trade tensions. US President Donald Trump said on Friday that he was presiding over \u201cthe greatest Economy in US history\u201d, but ignored the GDP figures in favour of attacking usually friendly TV channel Fox News. The moderate slowdown helped US stock market indices to gains in early trading in New York. Alphabet and Twitter are among the big movers on US stock markets, after they posted better-than-expected earnings. In the UK Vodafone\u2019s decision to float its mobile masts division has seen shares rise by almost 10% \u2013 helping the broader FTSE 100 to a 0.65% gain as the trading day approaches its end. And there\u2019s still no Sports Direct announcement. What on earth could Mike Ashley be doing? Thanks for joining us for today\u2019s coverage of business, economics and the markets. I\u2019ll be back bright and early on Monday as we build up to the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England later in the week. JJ The US GDP figures might suggest that a Fed rate cut can\u2019t address the real problem holding back the world\u2019s biggest economy. Ronald Temple, head of US equities, Lazard Asset Management, said: Today\u2019s GDP report reaffirms the Fed narrative that the US consumer is in good shape, but business confidence has weakened. A Fed rate cut appears to be a done deal next week, but the unfortunate reality is that rate cuts will not resolve uncertainties over trade policy. And another angle: US President Donald Trump has so far kept his counsel this morning, but the figures do not appear to back up the rationale for his tax cuts. Business investment remained meagre in the quarter, suggesting the growth boost given by the cuts may be unsustainable. Wall Street gains at the opening bell after US GDP figures that had something for everyone. The Nasdaq is storming ahead, up by 0.7%, while the S&amp;P 500 opened up 0.37% and the Dow Jones industrial average was up by 0.1%. Meanwhile, we\u2019re not wanting to sound like a broken record, but Sports Direct has delayed its results yet again after that 2pm BST deadline came and went. The delay has left some in the City with a bit of time on their hands on a sultry Friday afternoon. We hear that the new deadline is 4pm BST. Maybe don\u2019t hold your breath. The Fed\u2019s Jerome Powell should make it a \u201cone-and-done\u201d rate cut next week, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. This economy is not broken, and it does not need Fed action to fix it (but it will get it). So much for the first half rollover in the US economy. Growth averaged 2.6% in the first half, slightly better than the 2.4% average for the previous five years, despite the end of the boost from the tax cuts and the manufacturing recession. It might be enough for the Fed to stick to its guns and follow through on the widely expected rate cut next week. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, said: This slowdown just about justifies a 25 basis point cut by the Fed next week, but the chances of a bigger 50 basis point reduction just receded further. Despite the weaker headline gain, consumption growth actually accelerated to 4.3% in the second quarter, from 1.1%. But business investment declined by 0.6%. It looks like it might be a Goldilocks US GDP release for Wall Street: not too hot, not too cold. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York (via Reuters), said: This is just what the market needed, not so soft that the economy is slowing down precipitously and not so strong that the Fed is going to reverse course. We expected bad earnings and bad GDP numbers, but an upside on both is something markets are going to embrace today. US stock market futures have given up some of their earlier gains, but still point to a rising tide on Wall Street. Futures prices are pointing to increases of about 0.3% on the S&amp;P 500, the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq. US economic growth slowed in the second quarter of 2019 as ongoing trade disputes and a global slowdown took their toll. But, writes the Guardian\u2019s Dominic Rushe, the decline was less than expected \u2013 thanks to a consumer spending spree \u2013 and the report showed signs that there is continuing momentum in the US\u2019s decade-long economic expansion. You can read the full report here: The inflation figure in the GDP data is fairly striking: it shows that consumer prices rose by an annual rate of 2.3%, according to the personal consumption expenditures price index, one of the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred measures of inflationary pressures. That represented a large jump from the 0.4% rate seen in the first quarter. The figures also confirmed that the US economy missed the 3% growth target set by US President Donald Trump for 2018. US GDP expanded by 2.9% during the calendar year, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said, despite Trump\u2019s unfunded tax cuts. The cuts were criticised for targeting wealthier Americans. Already the doubts over the pace of the Federal Reserve\u2019s purported plans to cut rates are coming through. Here\u2019s the Bureau of Economic Analysis\u2019s graph showing the US GDP growth slowdown. The 2.1% annualised rate of GDP growth was the second slowest since the end of final quarter of 2016 \u2013 but it may cause something of a headache for the US Federal Reserve given that it came in ahead of economists\u2019 expectations. The Bureau of Economic Analysis said: The deceleration in real GDP in the second quarter reflected downturns in inventory investment, exports, and nonresidential fixed investment. These downturns were partly offset by accelerations in PCE and federal government spending. US economic growth slowed to an annualised rate of 2.1% in the second quarter \u2013 although that was faster than the 1.8% economists had expected. The US Bureau of Economic Analysis previously reported annualised GDP growth of 3.1% in the first three months of the year. The Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policymakers had given signs that they think US growth is slowing, weighed down in part by the trade war between Donald Trump\u2019s White House and China. Investors have dialled back their bets on a shock and awe 0.5 percentage point cut from the Federal Reserve next week, says IG Group\u2019s senior market analyst, Joshua Mahony. A strong GDP print in 10 minutes could make the Fed less willing to cut interest rates as quickly as some expect. The US dollar hit a two-month high on Friday as investors awaited GDP figures which are expected to show a slowdown in the American economy. The dollar index, which measures its performance against a trade-weighted basket of currencies, hit a high of 97.938 on Friday, a level not seen since the end of May. While most investors are expecting the figures to confirm the Federal Reserve\u2019s intentions to cut interest rates \u2013 usually a negative for the dollar\u2019s value \u2013 the European Central Bank is also preparing to lower borrowing costs. The dollar edged up against the euro on Friday. With just over half an hour to go until US GDP data is released, Wall Street futures prices are pointing to gains on stock markets: the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average are both set to rise by 0.3% and the Nasdaq is set for a 0.4% gain. Amazon and Google owner Alphabet both posted mixed earnings results last night, but Twitter beat analyst forecasts in results published today. Reuters reported: Twitter posted better-than-expected second-quarter revenue on Friday and an uptick in daily users who see advertisements on the site, driven by changes to show users more relevant content, sending its shares up by 5% in pre-market trading. However, the company forecast third-quarter revenue below many Wall Street estimates and said revenue growth would lag the first two quarters, partly due to ending some older ad formats. The UK car industry lobby group has welcomed Boris Johnson as prime minister \u2013 and reminded him that it is implacably opposed to his key policy. Mike Hawes, the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said that a no-deal Brexit \u2013 an option backed by Johnson and several senior cabinet members \u2013 \u201cpresents an existential threat to our industry\u201d. Some extracts from the letter: Above all, we must ensure the sector continues to enjoy \u2013 without interruption \u2013 preferential trade with critical markets around the world, including the EU. [...] when automotive succeeds, so does the UK. We cannot, however, continue to deliver these benefits, or take advantage of new opportunities, if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. A no-deal Brexit presents an existential threat to our industry. We are highly integrated with Europe, and a no-deal Brexit would result in huge tariff costs and disruption that would threaten production, as well as further undermining international investors\u2019 confidence in the UK. We need a deal with the EU that secures frictionless and tariff free trade. No-deal Brexit is simply not an option. Russia\u2019s central bank has joined the global move to stimulate the economy: it just delivered a rate cut from 7.5% to 7.25%. There could be more rate cuts to come, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation warned, as \u201cthe weak dynamics of domestic and external demand\u201d weigh on inflation. The central bank has seen a \u201csignificant drop in annual export growth rates, including on the back of weaker external demand\u201d, it said in its latest monetary policy statement. Sports Direct has finally given us an update: we need to wait for another update. The company is still finalising its results, and will let us know the progress at 2pm BST. A reminder: markets close at 4:30pm BST. Shares seem unaffected: they are now up by 2.2% to put them among the top 10 gainers on the FTSE 250 index. Sports Direct shares have now risen by more than 1% for the day \u2013 despite there being no update on the results. Some eyebrows have been raised in the City and on Fleet Street amid the confusion. Sports Direct earlier said there would be an update at midday. A spokesman for the Institute of Directors, the business group that focuses on corporate governance, said: \u201cGood communication is at the heart of good corporate governance, and boards should always try to avoid sending a confusing message to shareholders.\u201d Morning trading has been somewhat more forgiving than yesterday\u2019s performance on European stock markets. Most major indices, with the exception of Italy, have gained. The FTSE 100\u2019s gains have been underpinned by Vodafone \u2013 shares now up by 9.4% \u2013 as investors lick their lips on a \u00a310bn+ pay day if it successfully floats its European mobile masts business. The battle between Santander and its former chief executive, Andrea Orcel, has already been fairly colourful. Now it has hit the courts and the fur is really flying. Orcel had been offered the top job at Santander last year but the bank changed its mind in January, saying it could not meet his pay demands, writes the Guardian\u2019s Rob Davies. Santander has now accused Orcel of \u201cdubious ethical and moral behaviour\u201d after he sued the bank for \u20ac100m (\u00a390m) when it withdrew an offer to make him chief executive. Orcel had already quit his job as head of the UBS investment bank. The bank accused Orcel, one of Europe\u2019s highest-profile bankers, of making secret recordings during the dispute. You can read the whole tale here: The UK\u2019s broadcasting regulator has fined the news channel RT \u00a3200,000 for \u201cserious failures\u201d to comply with rules on impartiality in relation to its coverage of multiple issues related to Russian foreign policy. RT, previously known as Russia Today, was censured by Ofcom over its coverage of the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury, the armed conflict in Syria, and the Ukrainian government\u2019s position on Nazism and its treatment of Roma Gypsies. Ofcom will make the channel broadcast a summary of the findings to its viewers. RT broke impartiality rules seven times in March and April 2018, Ofcom said. In its statement, the regulator said: Taken together, these breaches represented serious and repeated failures of compliance with our rules. We were particularly concerned by the frequency of RT\u2019s rule-breaking over a relatively short period of time. A statement from the RT press office (via agencies) said: \u201cIt is very wrong for Ofcom to have issued a sanction against RT on the basis of its breach findings that are currently under judicial review by the High Court in London. RT went to court over Ofcom\u2019s December findings against our network because we believe that they were reached in a manner contrary to the law and were wrong.\u201d Let\u2019s have a quick Brexit update: new prime minister Boris Johnson came into office promising a renegotiation of the terms of the withdrawal agreement with the EU. The response was, perhaps unsurprisingly, a short, sharp no. European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker told Johnson that the current deal is the only one on offer. While widely expected, if neither side compromises a no-deal Brexit could become more likely. The pound has duly weakened against the dollar and the euro. Sterling lost 0.1% against the euro and the US dollar, remaining near the two-year low levels hit at the start of last week as Johnson\u2019s Brexit rhetoric hardened. Juncker will remain in post until his successor Ursula von der Leyen takes over on 31 October \u2013 the same day that the UK is scheduled to leave the EU. A commission spokesperson said: President Juncker listened to what Prime Minister Johnson had to say, reiterating the EU\u2019s position that the withdrawal agreement is the best and only agreement possible \u2013 in line with the European council guidelines. You can follow today\u2019s Brexit news on the politics live blog with the Guardian\u2019s Andrew Sparrow here: Here is what markets expect from the Federal Reserve, based on futures prices reported by CME Group. The current target range is 2.25% to 2.5%, so the upshot is there is apparently a 100% chance of a cut. Some investors are covering themselves for that 50 basis point (0.5 percentage point) cut, but the consensus remains that a 25 basis point cut is the most likely. Note that this is the implied probability \u2013 investors have just occasionally been proven wrong in the past. However, others are less sure that the federal open markets committee (FOMC), that sets rates, will be so pessimistic. Seth Carpenter, an economist at UBS, expects annualised US GDP growth of 2.6% for the second quarter \u2013 slower than the start of the year but significantly above 1.9% consensus expectations. That could \u201cease the FOMC\u2019s concerns on the near-term outlook\u201d, he wrote. We believe that the pervasive pessimism at the June FOMC meeting was in part driven by softness in April data, especially as the softness followed relatively tepid growth in the first quarter. Much of that weakness has subsequently been erased either by outright revisions or by strong gains in the following months. The data are a clear risk to our expectation of a 50 basis point cut next week. However, [...] the core of the committee has consistently downplayed good data and focused on weakness. If US GDP growth does slow, as expected, then that could provide an obvious rationale for the Fed to cut rates on Wednesday. With a rate cut all but guaranteed, if traders\u2019 bets are any guide, it could also give the chance for Powell to give a dovish signal \u2013 in contrast to his counterpart in the ECB, Mario Draghi. Draghi\u2019s statements \u201cdisappointed\u201d markets yesterday, but Powell could take a different path, according to Viraj Patel, a global macro strategist at financial tech company Arkera. Looking ahead to US GDP later, it\u2019s all about the implications for the Federal Reserve. Jerome Powell appears to have put the US central bank on a path towards a rate cut on Wednesday next week, in a move which could mark the end of an extraordinary period of monetary and economic history. The last time the Fed cut its main interest rate, the federal funds rate, the US economy was at the start of the financial crisis. Since then central banks around the world have unleashed unprecedented rounds of economic stimulus. After a decade of growth (albeit rather insipid growth) more and more economists think we are approaching a turning point. Weak eurozone data has this week raised fears of a recession in Germany, with the manufacturing sector particularly at risk. Powell has highlighted that weakening growth outlook alongside trade tensions in his most recent dovish comments. Sports Direct\u2019s repeated results delay is starting to annoy people. There is a \u201ctotal lack of visibility \u2013 there is not yet an indication that there is a material problem with the numbers, although one can draw one\u2019s own conclusions,\u201d said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com. It\u2019s a total and utter shambles and betrays a number of problems at the business after Ashley embarked on his rather random acquisition spree. Above all it betrays a total disregard for shareholders. It not only raises questions about the haphazard way in which the investor relations and finance teams are run, but also could suggest a material problem with the numbers. Additionally it raises a question about whether Ashley will ultimately take the company private. And here is the full update on the Sports Direct shenanigans from the Guardian\u2019s Rob Davies: Sports Direct says there will be an update around midday. There must be a fair bit of scrambling going on behind the scenes. Its auditor is Grant Thornton, which is under pressure over its failure to spot alleged manipulation of the accounts of Patisserie Valerie. Sports Direct \u2013 still a member of the FTSE 250 index of mid-cap stocks \u2013 has a history of what some might describe as unusual corporate governance. You can read about some of the more colourful episodes in the company\u2019s history here: Sports Direct\u2019s results are still being finalised, according to an emailed statement. Sports Direct said it still plans to report its full-year results at some point today \u2013 a week later than initially planned. Shares are now down by 2.9%. Vodafone\u2019s gains today would put it on track for its best day since November, after it said it will spin off its mobile masts business \u2013 potentially earning it more than \u00a310bn. The move would create Europe\u2019s largest tower company, said chief executive Nick Read. Barclays has previously valued the business at \u20ac12bn (\u00a310.7bn). We believe there is a substantial opportunity to unlock the embedded value of our towers, and we have startedpreparations for a range of monetisation options over the next 18 months, including a potential IPO. Vodafone also said it was \u201cconfident on full-year guidance\u201d of adjusted earnings of between \u20ac13.8bn and \u20ac14.2bn. Robert Grindle, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said that a better growth outlook, better cash generation and the potential spin-off \u201cshould augur a material change in share price momentum\u201d for Vodafone. Pearson is jostling with telecoms company Vodafone to be the biggest riser on the FTSE 100, after the world\u2019s largest education company put out a solid set of results. Shares have bumped by more than 7% in early trading as investors welcomed signs of a turnaround after a dire run of results. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a good first half, with underlying growth across all divisions, as we start to benefit from accelerating our shift to digital,\u201d chief executive John Fallon said. We are on track to at least stabilise revenue this year and return the company to top line growth from 2020. The former owner of the Financial Times, whose cash cow was print textbooks, has come under pressure from the shift to digital in recent years, but now appears to believe that belated investments in new technology will start to pay off. Sports Direct shares are down by 1.5% in early trades \u2013 still no sign of their results from where we are sitting. The FTSE 100 has gained 0.1% at the open, helping European shares to a 0.1% increase, according to the Euro Stoxx 600 index. France\u2019s Cac 40 index has gained 0.2%, but Spain\u2019s Ibex has lost 0.2%. Germany\u2019s Dax benchmark was flat at the opening bell. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The last decade has not exactly been boom-time, but we might miss it when it\u2019s gone. Central bankers are doing their best to cushion the bumps as the global economy slows, with a new consensus around a new round of stimulus from the world\u2019s two most important central banks. Yet it will not all be a smooth ride. Asian stock markets fell this morning after the European Central Bank yesterday managed to sow some doubts about just how quickly it will move to support the eurozone economy. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index lost 0.45%, the broader Topix lost 0.4%, while shares on Australia\u2019s ASX 200 lost 0.36% and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index lost 0.4%. Only the Chinese stock markets bucked the trend. ECB president Mario Draghi balanced the message that rate cuts are coming with the assertion that the rate-setting governing council had not even discussed cutting rates at this week\u2019s meeting. That contradicted market bets that a July cut was a 50/50 proposition. However, the message was otherwise fairly clear: anything other than a rate cut at the September ECB meeting would be a shock. Economists will now spend the rest of the summer trying to read the runes of how big the cut will be, and what accompanying measures such as quantitative easing (the stimulative programme of bond buying) will be included. Ian Williams, an economist at stockbroker Peel Hunt, said: Draghi described the eurozone economic outlook as \u201cworse and worse\u201d, although he also suggested that the risk of a recession is \u201cpretty low\u201d. He explained that, despite growing employment and wages, external factors are weighing on growth through the second and third quarters; specifically trade uncertainties, a particular challenge for the manufacturing sector. So risks remain tilted to the downside. Hot on the heels of Draghi\u2019s dour assessment of the European outlook, the main economic event of the day will be the US GDP release coming at 1:30pm BST today. Economists on average expect an annualised growth rate of 1.9% for the second quarter, a significant slowdown from the previous quarter of 3.1%. If that does come to pass all eyes will be on Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter account to see whether the US President renews his attacks on the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell. Trump wants looser policy to support the economy, and his re-election prospects. Powell\u2019s Fed meets next week to discuss their latest monetary policy stance, with investors bets on interest rates implying a 100% chance that the central bank will loosen the monetary taps. This chart from a few days ago shows why: leading indicators appear to show the world\u2019s largest economy is weakening. On the corporate news front, a tetchy Sports Direct will report its full-year results at some point today \u2013 a week later than initially planned. The delay was prompted by the complex integration of House of Fraser as well as the \u201ccurrent uncertainty as to the future trading performance of this business\u201d, but this week the company said its figures would be within previousy expectations after all. Life is certainly never dull following the court of founder Mike Ashley.

This applies to those who might be considered all-rounders if their bowling is sufficiently effective, so It\u2019s not either spinners or speed merchants.

There\u2019s a lot of feeble lamenting of the moral damage that the perpetually outraged, witch-hunting mores of social media do to us all. But that is to neglect the worst of it - the shameful but undeniable frisson of pleasure when it happens to someone of whom we are rather fond (particularly when it\u2019s richly unjust).

I am not at all surprised that Root, Woakes, YJB and Moeen have struggled in this game. None of them will have that clarity that is so necessary. Joe Root - with his habit of tailing off in longer series - is, I think, particularly susceptible to this. I\u2019d also wonder about Trevor Bayliss and the coaching staff, too - nobody gives much thought to their state of mind.\u201d</p> <p>We seem to have learned the square root of bugger all from the 2013-14 crash (the psychological impact of which is fascinatingly demonstrated in <a href=\"https://www.theedgefilm.com/?utm_campaign=2062613657&amp;adgroupid=79927118367&amp;utm_content=364032204602&amp;utm_term=edge%20cricket%20film&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwyerpBRD9ARIsAH-ITn8rCw0x2iKIYnEoSUsH3pyjQw6xstAD1N-tcfdLuWuYJe09UcvfGUMaAlt3EALw_wcB\">the new film, The Edge</a>).

I reckon there could be some significant Dwight Yorke-ing around with some of this bunch never being able to climb the mountain again. It is not a criticism \u2013 even for elite sportsmen, you need unusual hunger and temperament to keep going and going. It was a great trip four-year trip though. On Root, he may not be a great captain, but he is a great batsman and I reckon the sheer volume of cricket he plays is catching up with him.\u201d</p> <p>It does seem especially hard for English teams to climb the mountain again.

Broad and Anderson are fixtures, irrespective of form (there have been several times in his career when Broad should have been sent back to his county to get some form back). Both Woakes and Curran are looking like shoo-ins (shoos-in?) for the foreseeable, so maybe it\u2019s time England admitted that the Root experiment is a bust, and give someone with a degree of tactical nous a go. Nothing to lose.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure I agree with that \u2013 Broad has been dropped at least twice in the last 18 months, while Woakes and Curran are nowhere near regulars. (Curran is also nine years old.) I would say the only bowler who <em>might</em><em> </em>be capable of playing every remaining Test this year is Jofra Archer. There is an argument you could be more flexible, and have a vice-captain like Jos Buttler who could step in when the captain is injured/rotated. But that\u2019s a pretty big can of worms, and we\u2019ve already got a few of those on our hands.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d3ada4d8f0845f89e314c3c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-26T10:48:38.064Z\">11.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>\u201cIf we were to try to formularise the productivity benefit </strong>(sounding like a consultant) of captaincy, I wonder what percentage it can account for?\u201d says Bill Hargreaves. \u201cI wonder if switching from Root (we love him but...) to Morgan would deliver 10%, on average, to the performance of the players - 10% to batting scores and 10% off bowlers runs per wicket? Would that be in the right ballpark? If so, it is surely the difference between a series lost and won? And they are the Ashes, we are thinking about! No brainer, to my mind.\u201d<br></p> <p>I\u2019m not sure you can quantify it easily \u2013 for example, Mike Brearley\u2019s captaincy had a spectacular impact on the performances of Sir Ian Botham, not so much on those of Phil Edmonds. You have to consider all sorts of things - Morgan\u2019s age, mental fatigue, dodgy back, modest first-class record (what impact would it have on the team if Morgan averaged 12 and was being slaughtered by the media, etc) and so on. </p> <p>If England are battered in the Ashes, I would have an informal chat with Morgan about it, but I suspect the last four years took a lot more out of him than we realised.

It\u2019s really quite simple. Ireland could win a Test match for the first time today, by beating England, at Lord\u2019s. Modern life is infected by hyperbole - I just had the tastiest dry toast of my entire <em>life - </em>but this, truly, would be one of the most unlikely victories in Test history. If Ireland pull it off, 26 July will join <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/mar/15/ireland-england-croke-park-dublin-2007-six-nations-brian-ashton-rugby-union-interview\">24 February</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/02/ireland-beat-england-cricket\">2 March</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/jun/10/golden-goal-ray-houghton-for-republic-of-ireland-v-england-1988\">12 June</a> as a de facto St Patrick\u2019s Day, burned into the memory as a cultural and religious celebration of stuffing the English.</p> <p>This match has been so life-affirming, not to mention surreal, that it could have been directed by David Lynch. Given all that has happened, it\u2019s easy to forget this is only the third day. England will resume on 303 for nine, a lead of 181, with Stuart Broad and Olly Stone aiming to slog the target past 200. There are no obvious demons in the pitch. If Ireland hold their nerve, they should win. But that, clich\u00e9 fans, is easier said than done.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-26T08:44:53.057Z\">at 9.44am BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a match report. I\u2019ll be off then. Bye! There\u2019s some discussion about whether Mazher Arshad\u2019s stat is actually true, positing that Laker and Lock took all the wickets against Australia in 1956, and that when Devon Malcolm took nine against South Africa in 1994 somebody probably got the other (it was Darren Gough). But on none of those occasions did only two England bowlers bowl in the innings, you see. Chris Woakes is chirpy: It was always going to be a little bit trick defending that score but I always felt confident we could knock them over. Still you\u2019ve got to do a professional job, and it\u2019s fair to say we did that. The World Cup was long and quite gruelling at times, and mentally and physically you feel a little bit drained, but then you\u2019ve got a Test match to get up for. You find something from somewhere, but then when you get 0 first innings and don\u2019t bowl as well as you\u2019d like, you\u2019ve got to dig deep. Joe Root is relieved: I knew that was a lot of runs on that surface. We\u2019ve been in this position before, against India at Edgbaston last year, so we knew we\u2019d been able to manage a similar scenario. I thought it was very important that we stayed calm, in control of what we wanted to do and asked the right questions, and we did exactly that today. It was very pleasing, especially with the ball and the way we managed certain pressure situations through the game. I thought we managed pretty well. It wasn\u2019t by any stretch the perfect game for us but sometimes that can be a really important part of your learning for a team, and I certainly think we\u2019ll take a lot from this game. Ultimately we found a way to win and that was very important. There was a lot of different pressures around this Test match and to come out in the way we did today and close it out was very impressive. It wasn\u2019t difficult to lift ourselves [after the World Cup]. It\u2019s been good for us to play in this game and to get the result that we have at the end of it. I thought Ireland were excellent throughout, I thought they bowled brilliantly in both innings. Today, I just thought we were excellent with the ball. William Porterfield is disappointed: That was one of those things. We knew things were going to be tough when the lights were on and theree was a bit of drizzle in the air, but we had to try to get through that and get to this stage, when the sun\u2019s out and the ball is 15 or 20 overs old and gone a bit softer. But fair play to the two lads, how they bold. They made it difficult. We knew we were going to dig deep, but they just kept challenging everything. Jack Leach is the player of the match: I think bowling three overs for 26 and I\u2019ve got man of the match, I didn\u2019t ever see that happening. I\u2019m very pleased, and glad we got the win. I found some form out there, I just took one ball at a time and tried to do a job for the team. I got into the 90s and I got nervous, and didn\u2019t really know how to go about things from there. I tried to not think about it but probably didn\u2019t stop thinking about it from there. In four Tests at Lord\u2019s, Chris Woakes has scored 274 runs at an average of 69 (career average 29) and taken 23 wickets at an average of 9.75 (career average 31). Rob Smyth\u2019s statsmanship there. The last time only two England bowlers bowled and shared 10 wickets in an innings of a Test was in 1924 when Arthur Gillian and Maurice Tate took ten against South Africa in Brimingham. Mazher Arshad\u2019s stats this time. This match will have produced a lot of stats. Here\u2019s a few more: Hmmmmm, vaguely... It\u2019s over. The bowling was excellent, the slip catching immaculate, the batting a fair way below par. And that\u2019s it! Tim Murtagh exhibits his full range of wild heaves and makes contact only once, getting two for his troubles on that occasion. Woakes eventually aims at leg stump; Murtagh gives himself a bit of room and completely misses! 15th over: Ireland 36-7 (McBrine 0, Murtagh 0) How Boyd Rankin survived that over is beyond me. Stuart Broad, one wicket from his own five-for and clearly desperate to get it before Woakes steals it off him, wheels out a string of zingers (and one loose one that whipped down the leg side), but somehow the ball keeps missing the bat, or missing the stumps. A wicket maiden, but he wanted two. The lowest Test total at Lord\u2019s is 47, achieved by New Zealand in 1958. Broad gets McBrine! Another classic of the genre, moving gently away, taking the edge and it\u2019s another good, low catch for Root. 14th over: Ireland 36-8 (McBrine 0, Murtagh 0) Hello everyone! Woakes\u2019 first ball is powered down the ground by Thompson; the only person on the field to move after the ball pinged off the bat was McBrine, who completed the run before turning and trudging back again. 59.5% of Ireland\u2019s runs have come from boundaries, and there have only been five of them. That\u2019s a five-for for Woakes! Nicely caught by Root at slip, low to his right. 13th over: Ireland 32-7 (Thompson 0, McBrine 0) That\u2019s it from me, Simon Burnton is waiting to be tagged in. Please email him or tweet @simon_burnton. Bye! Seven down, three to go. Adair becomes the latest man to be bowled through the gate while trying to drive. It was another superb seaming delivery from Broad, who had been pulled for six off the previous ball. Although it is ending in disappointment, Adair has had a fine Test debut. 12.3 overs: Ireland 26-6 (Thompson 0, Adair 2) Adair, beaten for pace as he tries to pull, is smacked in the grille by a Broad bumper. That means another break in play. 12th over: Ireland 26-6 (Thompson 0, Adair 2) Adair is beaten by three consecutive deliveries from Woakes. The ball is talking, and Ireland would rather it didn\u2019t. One from the over: 6-2-11-4. 11th over: Ireland 25-6 (Thompson 0, Adair 1) To the wise, a word: it\u2019s probably safe to make other plans for the fifth day of this summer\u2019s Ashes Tests. Kevin O\u2019Brien is the latest man to go, pinned in front by another superb nipbacker from Broad. Bah. 10th over: Ireland 24-5 (O\u2019Brien 4, Thompson 0) A double-wicket maiden for Woakes, who has figures of 5-2-10-4. Another Woakes stat: he averages 22 in home Tests, 62 away from home. Ach, this really is a shame. Ireland shouldn\u2019t be too hard on themselves, because England have bowled immaculately in very helpful conditions - similar to those in which the world\u2019s best team, India, made 107 and 130 a year ago. In four Lord\u2019s Tests, Chris Woakes has made his only Test century, his second highest Test score - and taken 21 wickets at an average of 10.80. Scratch that, he\u2019s taken 22 wickets at 10.32! Gary Wilson has been given out LBW on review. He pushed outside the line of another beautiful delivery that hit him around the line of off stump. It was given not out but England reviewed instantly, and successfully. Both wicketkeepers, Wilson and Bairstow, have bagged a pair. Stuart Broad has been blindsided by Chris Woakes, who is bowling masterfully in helpful conditions. He has his third wicket now, which McCollum snicking a drive to first slip. It was another lovely full-length delivery that moved away to take the edge; Root did the rest. 9th over: Ireland 24-4 (McCollum 9, O\u2019Brien 4) O\u2019Brien is okay to continue. 8.4 overs: Ireland 24-3 (McCollum 9, O\u2019Brien 4) O\u2019Brien, lunging from the crease, thick edges Broad along the ground for four. The next ball is a beautiful bouncer that smacks into the helmet, which means an impromptu drinks break while O\u2019Brien has a concussion test. He looks okay in the sense that he is walking and talking; I have no idea whether he is concussed. Here\u2019s more on the Australian Ashes squad. I see we\u2019ve gone for the news angle. 8th over: Ireland 20-3 (McCollum 9, O\u2019Brien 0) The weather may have saved England from humiliation. The lights are on, which means conditions are very tough for batting, and so far the challenge has been too great for Ireland. Woakes almost gets his third wicket when Kevin O\u2019Brien edges this far short of Root at first slip. \u201cWoah there!\u201d says Guy Hornsby. \u201cI love an English cricket existentialist crisis as much as the next OBOer, but while there\u2019s always infinite parallel universes of possibility (my favourite is the one where Mark Ealham led us to the 1999 World Cup final then invented T25 cricket) surely this is all way too close to the Ashes for anything meaningful. And while there\u2019s a risk of a shellacking due to out of form and/or shattered players, we\u2019re going to have to give it at least a couple of innings defeats before we get all 90s on it (NB. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll get all 90s on it.)\u201d Oh yes, agreed. The fact is that, by tonight, they will probably have won 10 of the last 13 Tests. They might drop Rory Burns, who looks in woeful touch, but the rest of the squad will probably be as expected. It\u2019ll be interesting to see which seamers are left out of the squad, never mind the team. Sam Curran and Olly Stone will probably miss out. The dream is dying for Ireland. {ail Stirling has gone second ball, cleaned up by Woakes. He was unsettled by the previous delivery, which trampolined absurdly from a length. The next ball was fuller, tempting Stirling into the drive, and it seamed back through the gate to hit the stumps. 7th over: Ireland 18-2 (McCollum 9, Stirling 0) Broad has figures of 4-2-7-1. It\u2019s been superb, aggressive stuff, which many on social media are calling the best spell of bowling in a Test match since Sir Curtly Ambrose at Trinidad in 1994. Broad gets a deserved first wicket, and I\u2019m pretty sure won\u2019t be his last. He has been harassing both batsmen, bowling with ferocious intent, and Balbirnie could not take the heat. He pushed at a good-length delivery that moved away off the seam to find the edge, and Root crouched to take a comfortable catch at first slip. 6th over: Ireland 15-1 (McCollum 7, Balbirnie 4) Balbirnie push-drives his first ball stylishly down the ground for four. He\u2019s the big wicket, I think, the man most likely to hit a matchwinning 91 not out. Later in the over he softens his hands to ensure an edge off Woakes falls well short of the cordon. Meanwhile, replays show that Broad LBW appeal would have been \u2018umpire\u2019s call\u2019. Aleem Dar thought about it for a while, too. \u201cThe Sky bods are picking their Ashes teams and see Vince and Malan as the solution to England being three down for nothing, and having a middle order of No7s,\u201d says Kevin Wilson. \u201cI don\u2019t imagine an Ashes series is the time to experiment and you probably have to go with what you know (two guys who\u2019ll average 27 and get a couple of fifties) but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve gone into an Ashes series since the bad old days with this little confidence (and I include the away series we were thrashed in!).\u201d I can\u2019t recall having less confidence in the batting \u2013 the lot, not just the top three \u2013 yet I still think England could win through bits-and-pieces batting and high-class bowling in favourable conditions. We say this every time, but the first Test is so important. If Australia win, on their bogey ground, things might get ugly. 5th over: Ireland 11-1 (McCollum 7, Balbirnie 0) McCollum survives another big LBW shout from a Broad nipbacker. This was closer, and Aleem Dar thought about it for a while. It was probably going to be umpire\u2019s call at best on height, and Root decides not review. Broad is bowling with the kind of furious purpose that evokes Sir Curtly Ambrose\u2019s rampage at Trinidad in 1994. No, I am not a giddy England fan comparing figures of 0-4 with those of 6-24; Broad\u2019s are far better. But there is a similar intent and, I suspect, a similar disgust at the possibility of a shock defeat. 4th over: Ireland 11-1 (McCollum 7, Balbirnie 0) \u201cI think the days of the specialist captain have long gone,\u201d says Mark Gillespie. \u201cThe pressure on a captain averaging 25 would very quickly be massive, even for someone as good as Morgan (for example).\u201d You might be right, given the state of the modern world. But if you look at the England batsmen since the start of the last Ashes, an average of 25 wouldn\u2019t be too far below par. Jonny Bairstow takes a marvellous one-handed catch to dismiss William Porterfield! He edged Woakes low between the keeper and first slip, and Bairstow plunged to his left to grab it just above the ground. That was similar to Alec Stewart\u2019s famous grab to dismiss Brian Lara at Lord\u2019s in 1995, although he didn\u2019t have to go quite as far across. And it wasn\u2019t Brian Lara. 3rd over: Ireland 11-0 (Porterfield 2, McCollum 7) Thanks for all your emails, which I\u2019m trying to read between pleas for mercy from my brain and eyes. Broad starts his second over with another absurd jaffa that beats Porterfield, who then survives an appeal for a catch at second slip after being hit on the thigh. McCollum also survives a big LBW appeal later in the over. It looked like it was missing leg to me, and Joe Root decides not to review. Replays show England would have lost a review had they gone upstairs. McCollum ends a difficult over for Ireland on a high note with a thumping cover drive for four. Eleven down, 171 to go. 2nd over: Ireland 6-0 (Porterfield 2, McCollum 3) A fine start for Ireland. The first ball of the mini-session, bowled by Woakes, is flicked confidently through midwicket for three by McCollum; the next is driven crisply for two more by Porterfield. It would have been four but for a spectacular sliding save from Denly. File under: \u2018If England win by one run...\u2019 \u201cAndy Donald\u2019s comment that \u2018an Ireland win here will be met with little more than amused curiosity in Ireland\u2019 is coming, as he says, from the perspective of a \u2018long time Ireland fan\u2019,\u201d says John Mee. \u201cI think myself that an Ireland win would have a big impact amongst those, like myself, who aren\u2019t as knowledgeable as he is. Hard to see how it would fail to encourage youngsters to take an interest in playing the game.\u201d Enough! It\u2019s time for some actual cricket. \u201cHello Rob,\u201d says Geoff Wignall. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about being not very good at journalism; The Guardian has always shown a sympathetic and accommodating approach. On the question of captaincy, one obvious answer is to allow Bairstow to identify the best available Yorkshireman. Otherwise, though his lack of recent runs is an issue I\u2019d like to borrow Livingstone\u2019s cap to throw into the ring.\u201d Whenever they do pick a new captain, I can\u2019t see them taking a flyer. It just doesn\u2019t happen anymore. The more I think about it \u2013 and I\u2019ve thought about little else these past 30 seconds \u2013 I\u2019m sure Buttler will be the next Test captain if there\u2019s a change this year. \u201cIt seems to be implicit in this captaincy discussion that we\u2019re going to get crushed in the Ashes,\u201d says Peter McLeod. \u201cWhat are the good reasons to think we will be? Or are we all just being tremendously English about the whole thing?\u201d Well, yes, that\u2019s the thing \u2013 by tonight they may have won 10 of the last 12 Tests. But most of the team look shattered, out of form, not good enough or all of the above. For all that, it wouldn\u2019t be a great surprise if England won the Ashes 4-1. \u201cRob,\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cRe Mr Wallace\u2019s views on bowlers as captains: it usually happens that when a bowler is appointed England captain, he doesn\u2019t bowl himself nearly as much as he used to play. This applies to those who might be considered all-rounders if their bowling is sufficiently effective, so It\u2019s not either spinners or speed merchants. If it\u2019s the latter, though, he\u2019s usually the senior pro. There\u2019s a case to be made for wicketkeepers as captains since he\u2019s the one to allocate bowling workloads, but also crack down on inaccuracy. Bowlers often pull their socks up a bit more in these cases.\u201d \u201cWho bats No5 and 6 for Australia from that squad?\u201d says Andrew Hurley. \u201cCan\u2019t figure out Carey being omitted..\u201d I suspect the team for the first Test will be something like: Warner, Harris, Khawaja, Smith, Labuschgne or Bancroft, Head, Paine, Cummins, Lyon and then two from Starc, Hazlewood and Pattinson. Play will resume at 12.30pm Nathan Lyon is of course in the Australian squad. I missed him out, because I am not very good at journalism. \u201cI seem to recall Glamorgan\u2019s Tony Lewis being selected to captain, as a new England player, an overseas tour,\u201d says Nigel. \u201cHe came back having averaged around 25. I don\u2019t think he played for England again. Was that a good move?\u201d Well, he averaged 38 and was left out after the first Test of the following summer. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a good move per se, just that I think it would be good for this particular team. There\u2019s no Alex Carey in the Australian squad, which will surprise a few people after his masterful batting during the World Cup. Paine (c), Bancroft, Cummins, Harris, Hazlewood, Head, Khawaja, Labuschagne, Lyon, M Marsh, Neser, Pattinson, Siddle, Smith, Starc, Wade, Warner. \u201cDear Rob,\u201d says Robert Wilson. \u201cThere have been two main pleasures in this really delightful match. First, this generation of Irish players getting their day in the sun after pulling off the fairly Sisyphean task of getting Test status was deeply satisfying. Must have all felt worth it and more on the evening of that first day (plus it gave the County Heads a lot of top quality We-Told-You-So opportunities in re the indefatigable Murtagh). \u201cAnd then it was not unsucculent to see you getting a bit of sledging from the OBO slips cordon yesterday on the subject of Bairstow. There\u2019s a lot of feeble lamenting of the moral damage that the perpetually outraged, witch-hunting mores of social media do to us all. But that is to neglect the worst of it - the shameful but undeniable frisson of pleasure when it happens to someone of whom we are rather fond (particularly when it\u2019s richly unjust). I truly wish I didn\u2019t find it funny but I do. Deeply.\u201d As somebody who (rather guiltily) finds nothing funnier than an animated loss of noggin, I know what you mean. Social media really is the gift that keeps on giving! \u201cWhat about Moeen Ali as captain?\u201d says Pete Mackelworth. \u201cI know there is the aspect of his \u2018pick-ability\u2019 and form, but he seems to be a thoughtful player and potentially someone who would bloom with the responsibility\u2026 on the other hand he may be just toooooo nice\u2026\u201d He has captained Worcestershire really impressively. But he\u2019s 32, and his form is too variable at the best of times. It\u2019s a no from me. The covers are coming off, though the umpires are yet to inspect. I think our Leather on Willow Predictor was a bit optimistic in suggesting play would resume at 12.15pm. \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Luke Dealtry. \u201cMike Atherton wrote the other day in an article about the 2005 Ashes, Jonathan Trott\u2019s burnout and the World Cup. \u2018The more I watch the game, the more I am convinced that a player\u2019s state of mind, the freshness of mind, is far more important that time in the middle, or overs under the belt.\u2019 I do think there are issues with Bayliss\u2019s approach to the longer game, but I\u2019m inclined to agree with PEC Mike about proven, high quality players. I am not at all surprised that Root, Woakes, YJB and Moeen have struggled in this game. None of them will have that clarity that is so necessary. Joe Root - with his habit of tailing off in longer series - is, I think, particularly susceptible to this. I\u2019d also wonder about Trevor Bayliss and the coaching staff, too - nobody gives much thought to their state of mind.\u201d We seem to have learned the square root of bugger all from the 2013-14 crash (the psychological impact of which is fascinatingly demonstrated in the new film, The Edge). On reflection, the schedule for this summer is on the sadistic side of negligent. That\u2019s one of the reasons I think the Test team might unravel in the next two months. It\u2019s a really important issue which hasn\u2019t been addressed despite multiple warnings. \u201cGood morning Rob,\u201d says Jonny Lewis. \u201cWe all know the pay-off for the World Cup is coming \u2013 possibly today, but definitely in The Ashes. I reckon there could be some significant Dwight Yorke-ing around with some of this bunch never being able to climb the mountain again. It is not a criticism \u2013 even for elite sportsmen, you need unusual hunger and temperament to keep going and going. It was a great trip four-year trip though. On Root, he may not be a great captain, but he is a great batsman and I reckon the sheer volume of cricket he plays is catching up with him.\u201d It does seem especially hard for English teams to climb the mountain again. Might do my dissertation on that. \u201cYou say the captain is generally a batsman \u2018because they are much more secure in the team\u2019,\u201d says Simon Wallace. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the case. Broad and Anderson are fixtures, irrespective of form (there have been several times in his career when Broad should have been sent back to his county to get some form back). Both Woakes and Curran are looking like shoo-ins (shoos-in?) for the foreseeable, so maybe it\u2019s time England admitted that the Root experiment is a bust, and give someone with a degree of tactical nous a go. Nothing to lose.\u201d I\u2019m not sure I agree with that \u2013 Broad has been dropped at least twice in the last 18 months, while Woakes and Curran are nowhere near regulars. (Curran is also nine years old.) I would say the only bowler who might be capable of playing every remaining Test this year is Jofra Archer. There is an argument you could be more flexible, and have a vice-captain like Jos Buttler who could step in when the captain is injured/rotated. But that\u2019s a pretty big can of worms, and we\u2019ve already got a few of those on our hands. \u201cIf we were to try to formularise the productivity benefit (sounding like a consultant) of captaincy, I wonder what percentage it can account for?\u201d says Bill Hargreaves. \u201cI wonder if switching from Root (we love him but...) to Morgan would deliver 10%, on average, to the performance of the players - 10% to batting scores and 10% off bowlers runs per wicket? Would that be in the right ballpark? If so, it is surely the difference between a series lost and won? And they are the Ashes, we are thinking about! No brainer, to my mind.\u201d I\u2019m not sure you can quantify it easily \u2013 for example, Mike Brearley\u2019s captaincy had a spectacular impact on the performances of Sir Ian Botham, not so much on those of Phil Edmonds. You have to consider all sorts of things - Morgan\u2019s age, mental fatigue, dodgy back, modest first-class record (what impact would it have on the team if Morgan averaged 12 and was being slaughtered by the media, etc) and so on. If England are battered in the Ashes, I would have an informal chat with Morgan about it, but I suspect the last four years took a lot more out of him than we realised. I think he\u2019ll become a T20 traveller. This is a lovely story from Kyle McCallan, the former Ireland spinner, on Sky Sports When Ireland were preparing for their runchase against Pakistan at the 2007 World Cup, the captain Trent Johnston walked round the dressing-room pointing at the players while asking some important questions: Do you want to be back delivering post on Monday? Do you want to be back in the classroom on Monday? Do you want to be back on the farm on Monday, Boyd Rankin? I don\u2019t want to be a carpet salesman on Monday! The covers are on, with no immediate prospect of a resumption. The Guardian\u2019s exclusive Leather on Willow Predictor reckons the players will be back on at 12.15pm. \u201cI\u2019ve always wondered why it has to be a batsman to captain the Test side,\u201d says Robbie Chedburn. \u201cI guess it would be tricky for a bowling captain to select themselves to bowl continuously. But if we could get over that, why not a Woakes or a Curran captain? England have to try something new! The last two captaincies have destroyed the form of our best two batsmen!\u201d One of the reasons is that batsmen are much more secure in the team. That was the case even before the schedule made rotation of bowlers essential. If England do change captain, there is no easy answer. I suspect the lesser evil would be Buttler as captain in Tests and ODIs, but that doesn\u2019t sit comfortably. 1.1 overs: Ireland 0-0 (Porterfield 0, McCollum 0) After seven deliveries of the Ireland innings, the umpires takes the players off the field. That\u2019s good news for Ireland, because batting looked very tough, and they will hope things are a bit easier when the weather improves after lunchtime. 1st over: Ireland 0-0 (Porterfield 0, McCollum 0) Broad starts around the wicket to the left-handed Porterfield, who is keen to leave as many deliveries as possible against the new ball. He has to play at one absolute jaffa that straightens spectacularly to beat the outside edge. A maiden to start the innings. \u201cRather than picking someone who \u2018looks like a captain\u2019 (do we really know much about Jos Buttler\u2019s tactical acumen) why not pick an actual captain?\u201d sniffs Gary Naylor. \u201cSomerset\u2019s Tom Abell had leadership thrust upon him at an early age and his form suffered, but he got through it and now gets the most out of himself and his team. Which is the desired outcome and not what\u2019s happening now.\u201d Well, I think we do know about Buttler, because he is one of the most intelligent batsmen in the world and that is usually transferrable. But I agree with the principle \u2013 England would be better off with a specialist captain, even if he averaged 25 with the bat, than trying to squash all the galacticos into the same team. It\u2019s Gerrardlamparditis, and it feels like the whole team needs a rethink. And yet, as I type, they\u2019ve won nine of their last 11 Tests. What\u2019s the rumpus? Stuart Broad will take the new ball. He has form for defending a lowish target in a Lord\u2019s Test, and he\u2019s surely England\u2019s likeliest matchwinner. The lights are on and it feels like a seriously good time to bowl. \u201cMaybe worth a review from Stone?\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cThere are probably one or two in the England dressing room who would have ...\u201d \u201cAs a long time Ireland fan, I genuinely appreciate the enthusiasm of your opening preamble,\u201d says Andy Donald. \u201cHowever, I don\u2019t think that enthusiasm will be shared by the large majority in Ireland. Giving Ireland Test status was a huge step, but it sometimes feels like a token gesture for screwing with the ODI and T20 World Cups. I think so much more can be done for smaller cricket playing nations and until then, an Ireland win here will be met with little more than amused curiosity in Ireland than anything impactful in the long term.\u201d We\u2019ve had a few emails along similar lines, which is surprising and a bit disappointing. Surely a win today would start to change that? Haha, what a start. Stuart Thompson has bowled Olly Stone with the first ball of the day, a beautiful inswinger that swerved through the gate and sent the leg stump flying. Ireland need 182 to win! The Ireland players stroll out to the middle. Tim Murtagh, as usual, is walking in that self-conscious, almost shifty manner, like somebody who thinks he\u2019s being watched. And he bloody is being watched, because he\u2019s been the star of the show. Play will start at 11.10am. In other words, any minute now. Thanks to Al Ferguson for providing the Test Match Special link. Here\u2019s Andrew Hurley, returning to a theme of yesterday\u2019s OBO. \u201cThere is a huge culture issue in the team... and here Bayliss is hugely at fault. His laissez-faire attitude fine for the ODI team as they had a strong and respected captain, but it doesn\u2019t work for the Test side. Their tendency to collapse is (from my expert psychological viewpoint!) linked to the culture. NZ rugby team have a \u2018no dickheads\u2019 policy - England Test cricket would do well to meditate on their culture with this in mind.\u201d Imagine if certain football teams adhered to that policy. \u201cI\u2019m really keen on a fresh start (regardless of the Ashes result) with Bayliss going and a new captain,\u201d says Neil Harris. \u201cRoot has to bat No3 and he has to get back to his best; relinquishing the captaincy can help this. Buttler captain, Stokes vice-captain. But who\u2019s the coach? There seems to be very little chat about this in the press.\u201d It sounds like there may be an interim coach for the winter, perhaps Chris Silverwood. It will probably take a while to get the team Ashley Giles wants, with a head coach and three assistants. The start will be delayed. The covers are on and there\u2019s some light rain falling. I don\u2019t think it will be too long before we receive the gift of Test cricket. \u201cIn Ireland\u2019s sporting history, maybe this will be seen as the realisation of \u2018The Test Dream\u2019,\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cBut I remember watching the Sopranos episode of the same name and thinking that season five, episode 11 was when the shark was deliberately being tempted into open waters in front of a ramp with some guy in an Evel Knievel suit and a bike to match revving up his motor preparing for the off. I hope for Ireland\u2019s sake this weird contrivance is more than a dream.\u201d What violin? (NB: clip is NSFW/contains adult language/FOR GOODNESS SAKE DON\u2019T SHOW IT TO THE WEANS) \u201cI agree with changing the captain,\u201d says Patrick Brennan. \u201cFor some reason it just doesn\u2019t seem to sit right with Joe Root. Results haven\u2019t been awful overall, but the ridiculous collapses are just happening too often for comfort. I\u2019d give serious consideration to making Stokes captain. Yes, he\u2019d have a heavy workload, but he\u2019s arguably turned into our most reliable (and sensible) batsman in the last six months. Buttler as ODI/T20 captain once Morgan wants to stop.\u201d I doubt Stokes will ever captain England after Bristol, except maybe in the odd tour match. Whether that\u2019s correct is another discussion. In truth, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d like him as captain anyway \u2013 his workload and commitment to every single delivery are already off the charts, and he is a brilliant unofficial leader. \u201cThis match has demonstrated how disrespectful it was to only give Ireland a four-day Test,\u201d says David Hopkins. \u201cSuggesting that they would need any more than two and a half days to beat England was frankly insulting.\u201d David Hopkins is here all week. It\u2019s a four-day week though. Pre-match reading \u201cWhat\u2019s the answer?\u201d says Matt Turland. \u201cObviously I\u2019ve not asked a question there, but this Test team\u2026 what\u2019s the answer? For me, I\u2019d definitely give Buttler the captaincy and bring Foakes back into the fold. Other than that, I don\u2019t really know anymore. Ali probably needs a bit of time away, Bairstow should probably be rotated out for a little while and Root should be made to bat at No3 but I don\u2019t really know anything, do I?\u201d Nobody does. Buttler as captain after the Ashes (if they lose) is a persuasive idea, but I worry about the workload as he is going to be the ODI captain sooner rather than later. I think England need to split the captaincy, but I\u2019m not sure how they do that. I fear that, by the end of the summer, all options will be on the table, including a surprise return to the Test captaincy for Chris Cowdrey. We may have a delayed start, as there has been heavy rain in St John\u2019s Wood this morning. The forecast is better from around midday, with the temperature expected to be 24 degrees. A little brisk. Hello. It\u2019s really quite simple. Ireland could win a Test match for the first time today, by beating England, at Lord\u2019s. Modern life is infected by hyperbole - I just had the tastiest dry toast of my entire life - but this, truly, would be one of the most unlikely victories in Test history. If Ireland pull it off, 26 July will join 24 February, 2 March and 12 June as a de facto St Patrick\u2019s Day, burned into the memory as a cultural and religious celebration of stuffing the English. This match has been so life-affirming, not to mention surreal, that it could have been directed by David Lynch. Given all that has happened, it\u2019s easy to forget this is only the third day. England will resume on 303 for nine, a lead of 181, with Stuart Broad and Olly Stone aiming to slog the target past 200. There are no obvious demons in the pitch. If Ireland hold their nerve, they should win. But that, clich\u00e9 fans, is easier said than done.",

      "body": "<p>Sapiens author Yuval Noah Harari has acknowledged that he authorised replacing criticism of Vladimir Putin with criticism of Donald Trump in the Russian edition of his bestseller, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, saying that Russian censors would not have allowed him to publish the original text.</p> <p>Earlier this week, <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/author-yuval-noah-harari-under-fire-removing-putin-criticism-russian-translation-new-book-1450676\">Newsweek reported</a> that the Russian translation of 21 Lessons blunted Harari\u2019s criticism of Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea in 2014. </p> <p>In English, the book says that \u201cwe are constantly told that we are living in a new and frightening era of \u2018post-truth\u2019\u201d, citing the annexation of the peninsula as an example.</p> <p>\u201cThe Russian government and President Putin personally denied several times that these were Russian troops and described them as spontaneous \u2018self-defence units\u2019 who acquired a uniform similar to the Russian [one] in local stores,\u201d writes Harari. \u201cWhen they made such rather ridiculous statements, Putin and his associates knew perfectly well that they were lying.\u201d</p> <p>But in the Russian edition, Harari uses Trump to make this point: \u201cAccording to estimates of the Washington Post newspaper, President Trump made more than 6,000 false public statements in the time after his inauguration.\u201d</p> <p>Harari said that he had approved revisions of all his books for different audiences.</p> <p>\u201cAs a thinker and author, I do my best to reach diverse audiences around the world. To enable my ideas and messages to easily reach people from various countries, over the years I have authorised and even initiated adaptations of all my books \u2026 The adaptations take into account different cultural, religious and political backgrounds. If I could, I would rewrite my books from scratch for each and every country, but I obviously cannot. When making adaptations, my guiding principle is to adapt the examples I use to explain my ideas, but never to change the ideas themselves,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIn Russia, I was warned that due mainly to two examples I use, which sharply criticise the Russian invasion of Ukraine, censorship will not allow the publication and distribution of the book. I therefore faced a dilemma. Should I replace these few examples and publish the book in Russia \u2013 or should I change nothing, and publish nothing?\u201d</p> <p>He said he chose to publish without the mention of the invasion, \u201cbecause it seemed to me important that the book\u2019s ideas should reach readers in Russia, especially as the book is still very critical of the Putin regime. The Russian translation warns readers about the dangers of dictatorship, corruption, homophobia and nationalist extremism. I don\u2019t support Russian censorship \u2013 I have to deal with it.\u201d</p> <p>But Harari added that while he had authorised some changes to the Russian translation, he had since learned of further, unauthorised revisions: \u201cI was told that where I speak of the Russian conquest of Crimea, \u2018conquest\u2019 was changed to \u2018re-attachment\u2019, and that where I speak about my husband, it was changed to \u2018partner\u2019. If this is true, I strongly object to all such unauthorised alterations, and I will do my best to correct them.\u201d</p> <p>Two years ago, the fantasy novelist VE Schwab <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/16/authors-fury-russian-censorship-gay-scene-schwab-shades-magic\">found that one of her scenes</a>, about the romantic relationship between two male characters, had been cut in Russia without her permission. Books featuring LGBT characters and storylines are regularly shrinkwrapped in Russia, following 2013\u2019s ruling banning the spreading of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/11/russia-law-banning-gay-propaganda\">propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations</a>\u201d among minors.</p>",

In English, the book says that \u201cwe are constantly told that we are living in a new and frightening era of \u2018post-truth\u2019\u201d, citing the annexation of the peninsula as an example. \u201cThe Russian government and President Putin personally denied several times that these were Russian troops and described them as spontaneous \u2018self-defence units\u2019 who acquired a uniform similar to the Russian [one] in local stores,\u201d writes Harari. \u201cWhen they made such rather ridiculous statements, Putin and his associates knew perfectly well that they were lying.\u201d But in the Russian edition, Harari uses Trump to make this point: \u201cAccording to estimates of the Washington Post newspaper, President Trump made more than 6,000 false public statements in the time after his inauguration.\u201d Harari said that he had approved revisions of all his books for different audiences. \u201cAs a thinker and author, I do my best to reach diverse audiences around the world. To enable my ideas and messages to easily reach people from various countries, over the years I have authorised and even initiated adaptations of all my books \u2026 The adaptations take into account different cultural, religious and political backgrounds. If I could, I would rewrite my books from scratch for each and every country, but I obviously cannot. When making adaptations, my guiding principle is to adapt the examples I use to explain my ideas, but never to change the ideas themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Russia, I was warned that due mainly to two examples I use, which sharply criticise the Russian invasion of Ukraine, censorship will not allow the publication and distribution of the book. I therefore faced a dilemma. Should I replace these few examples and publish the book in Russia \u2013 or should I change nothing, and publish nothing?\u201d He said he chose to publish without the mention of the invasion, \u201cbecause it seemed to me important that the book\u2019s ideas should reach readers in Russia, especially as the book is still very critical of the Putin regime. The Russian translation warns readers about the dangers of dictatorship, corruption, homophobia and nationalist extremism. I don\u2019t support Russian censorship \u2013 I have to deal with it.\u201d But Harari added that while he had authorised some changes to the Russian translation, he had since learned of further, unauthorised revisions: \u201cI was told that where I speak of the Russian conquest of Crimea, \u2018conquest\u2019 was changed to \u2018re-attachment\u2019, and that where I speak about my husband, it was changed to \u2018partner\u2019. If this is true, I strongly object to all such unauthorised alterations, and I will do my best to correct them.\u201d Two years ago, the fantasy novelist VE Schwab found that one of her scenes, about the romantic relationship between two male characters, had been cut in Russia without her permission. Books featuring LGBT characters and storylines are regularly shrinkwrapped in Russia, following 2013\u2019s ruling banning the spreading of \u201cpropaganda of non-traditional sexual relations\u201d among minors.",

It will remain in our consciousness, just as other protest movements of the past have done.\u201d</p> <p>The museum has also acquired a child\u2019s hi-vis jacket, worn during an XR protest, which will go on display at the V&amp;A\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/moc/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIveW2tcLS4wIVirHtCh2EjgclEAAYASAAEgJHaPD_BwE\">Museum of Childhood</a> as part of a display about how the movement has engaged with families, accompanied by a programme of workshops.</p> <p>Clive Russell, a member of XR\u2019s arts group, said the organisation was pleased the work could be seen for free alongside work by William Morris and other \u201cdesign activists\u201d of the past. </p> <p>\u201cThe climate and ecological emergency is the issue of our time, and art and design is crucial to our non-violent actions and communication,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe call on all artists and designers to think beyond the bullying constraints of commercial drudgery and join us in rebellion.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A year ago, the climate activist movement Extinction Rebellion did not even exist. Now, just nine months after its first public action, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London has acquired a number of artefacts associated with the group, saying the visual impact of its campaigns can be compared to that of the suffragettes. A green, blue and pink flag printed with the movement\u2019s distinctive extinction symbol, two printing blocks used by activists early in the campaign to make their own protest banners and an already rare pamphlet from the first print run produced by the group will join the V&amp;A\u2019s permanent collections as part of its \u201crapid response\u201d programme to put contemporary and newsworthy objects on display. The museum, which specialises in art and design, has also acquired digital artefacts including the website from which the symbol is freely available for anyone to use, and a downloadable file for 3D printers, allowing activists to create and immediately use their own printing block to create yet more banners, T-shirts and placards. Corinna Gardner, the senior curator of design and digital at the V&amp;A, said the collection recognised how effectively Extinction Rebellion (XR) had created a highly distinctive visual identity and harnessed open-source technology to enable DIY campaigning to spread rapidly across the globe. \u201cExtinction Rebellion\u2019s first public act was only in October last year, but it has become clear is that their acts of rebellion have a visual character and identity that is singular,\u201d she said. \u201cMy interest is how, through a really considered set of design choices, Extinction Rebellion have brought a joyous but also focused sense of purpose to their actions.\u201d From its adoption (with permission) of the highly recognisable extinction symbol first designed in 2011 by the London street artist ESP to its limited but \u201cpunchy\u201d colour palette and carefully worded slogans, she said the group had used design to galvanise concern for the climate emergency. As such, she said, its design approach stood in relation to the suffragettes, who similarly relied on a limited colour palette of green, white and purple to visually communicate their cause. \u201cThey have created a visual identity that those of us who are experiencing it will remember. It will remain in our consciousness, just as other protest movements of the past have done.\u201d The museum has also acquired a child\u2019s hi-vis jacket, worn during an XR protest, which will go on display at the V&amp;A\u2019s Museum of Childhood as part of a display about how the movement has engaged with families, accompanied by a programme of workshops. Clive Russell, a member of XR\u2019s arts group, said the organisation was pleased the work could be seen for free alongside work by William Morris and other \u201cdesign activists\u201d of the past. \u201cThe climate and ecological emergency is the issue of our time, and art and design is crucial to our non-violent actions and communication,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe call on all artists and designers to think beyond the bullying constraints of commercial drudgery and join us in rebellion.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, has described Boris Johnson\u2019s approach to Brexit talks as putting the UK \u201con a collision course with the EU\u201d. Johnson told Britain\u2019s parliament on Thursday the Irish border backstop had to be abolished or there would be no Brexit deal. \u201cThe statements of the British prime minister yesterday in the House of Commons were very unhelpful to this process,\u201d Coveney said after meeting the new Northern Ireland secretary in Belfast on Friday. \u201cHe seems to have made a deliberate decision to set Britain on a collision course with the European Union and with Ireland in relation to the Brexit negotiations, and I think only he can answer the question as to why he is doing that,\u201d Coveney said. He said Johnson\u2019s approach \u201cis not the basis for an agreement\u201d. \u201cI think from a Brexit negotiating perspective, it was a very bad day yesterday. We will have to wait whether that message coming from London changes in the weeks ahead,\u201d said Coveney. But after the first meeting with Julian Smith, the new Northern Ireland secretary, he also hinted at a breakthrough in talks about the devolved government, saying there was hope of a deal concluding in the coming weeks. Johnson\u2019s spokesman, meanwhile, has said the UK is ready to begin talks with the EU on Brexit, but is clear-eyed about what the basis for those discussions is. The Belfast meeting with Smith, the former chief whip, was the first British-Irish engagement since Boris Johnson became prime minister. The Irish border backstop is a central part of the withdrawal agreement and commits both sides to maintaining an invisible border on the island of Ireland should trade talks collapse. Johnson has said there were ways to achieve this other than by keeping Northern Ireland aligned with the republic and EU\u2019s regulations on customs and trading standards until a solution was found. However, Ireland is also concerned about intangibles such as peace and community relations on the border. Johnson\u2019s approach has been rebuffed by the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, in a phone call on Thursday. Coveney said there was a renewed sense of urgency about getting Stormont back up and running given the challenges the region faces in the coming months. He said there was hope that a deal could be concluded in the coming weeks to restore power two-and-a-half years after the Stormont assembly collapsed. Democratic Unionist party sources have said they are also hopeful of a breakthrough. The party\u2019s leader, Arlene Foster, has said she is keen to get the local institutions up and running again to get money and reforms flowing again on health and education.",

You might, for example, be of the view that white is white, ros\u00e9 pink and red red, but I\u2019ve unearthed a secret prejudice against two shades in particular.</p> <p>First, deep pink ros\u00e9s, which used to be common, especially in the days when ros\u00e9 was sneered at for being unmanly. The immediate reaction from producers was to make their ros\u00e9s more pink, but practically everyone has since reverted to the fashionable, pale, Proven\u00e7al style, and is also bottling it in magnums for chaps who are still a bit squeamish about being seen drinking the stuff. Yet there are deep-coloured ros\u00e9s such as tavel and cerasuolo (and appellations that produce only ros\u00e9) that have much more character and are better suited to drinking with barbecues and meat. One producer I visited recently, <a href=\"http://www.domainemaby.fr/?menu=vins&amp;smenu=C%F4tes%20du%20Rh%F4ne\" title=\"\">Domaine Maby in the Rh\u00f4ne</a>, makes two styles in adjacent vineyards: a lirac (now sold out), which is an on-trend baby pink; and a tavel (see below), which is deep crimson.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/mar/31/good-reds-from-bordeaux-that-wont-break-the-bank\">Good Bordeaux reds that won\u2019t break the bank</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The other unloved category is light reds. You may say: \u201cWhat about red burgundy?\u201d And that\u2019s true, but I think most people would rather have a deeper-coloured pinot from, say, Chile or Central Otago than the almost translucent red of a young mercurey or santenay \u2013 or what my red wine-loving neighbour disparagingly calls \u201cflippy-floppy reds\u201d. According to the Chilean wine producer Cono Sur, which has just bottled the comparatively light and widely available Bicicleta Pinot Noir with a label that changes colour when it\u2019s chilled, more than a third of consumers believe it\u2019s \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d to put red wine in the fridge.</p> <p>Then there are orange, or skin-contact, wines \u2013 that is, whites made in the same way as reds by leaving the juice in contact with the skins, which makes them go a much deeper colour than a pale, straw-coloured white such as pinot grigio \u2013 for 150 days in the case of the zibibbo in today\u2019s picks. I wouldn\u2019t say the prejudice was as great against these, but that\u2019s largely because not all wine drinkers are aware they even exist.

      "bodyText": "How much do you judge a wine by its colour? More than you think, I\u2019d suggest. You might, for example, be of the view that white is white, ros\u00e9 pink and red red, but I\u2019ve unearthed a secret prejudice against two shades in particular. First, deep pink ros\u00e9s, which used to be common, especially in the days when ros\u00e9 was sneered at for being unmanly. The immediate reaction from producers was to make their ros\u00e9s more pink, but practically everyone has since reverted to the fashionable, pale, Proven\u00e7al style, and is also bottling it in magnums for chaps who are still a bit squeamish about being seen drinking the stuff. Yet there are deep-coloured ros\u00e9s such as tavel and cerasuolo (and appellations that produce only ros\u00e9) that have much more character and are better suited to drinking with barbecues and meat. One producer I visited recently, Domaine Maby in the Rh\u00f4ne, makes two styles in adjacent vineyards: a lirac (now sold out), which is an on-trend baby pink; and a tavel (see below), which is deep crimson. The other unloved category is light reds. You may say: \u201cWhat about red burgundy?\u201d And that\u2019s true, but I think most people would rather have a deeper-coloured pinot from, say, Chile or Central Otago than the almost translucent red of a young mercurey or santenay \u2013 or what my red wine-loving neighbour disparagingly calls \u201cflippy-floppy reds\u201d. According to the Chilean wine producer Cono Sur, which has just bottled the comparatively light and widely available Bicicleta Pinot Noir with a label that changes colour when it\u2019s chilled, more than a third of consumers believe it\u2019s \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d to put red wine in the fridge. Then there are orange, or skin-contact, wines \u2013 that is, whites made in the same way as reds by leaving the juice in contact with the skins, which makes them go a much deeper colour than a pale, straw-coloured white such as pinot grigio \u2013 for 150 days in the case of the zibibbo in today\u2019s picks. I wouldn\u2019t say the prejudice was as great against these, but that\u2019s largely because not all wine drinkers are aware they even exist. But again, they do have something unusual to offer, namely a different, richer flavour profile. To me, these unloved colours have real virtues. I reckon deep-coloured ros\u00e9 would win over ros\u00e9 sceptics, while light reds, spurned though they might be by my neighbour, are a way of getting white-wine drinkers into reds. As with most things wine-related, you just need to keep an open mind. Four wines that look the business Cerasuolo d\u2019Abruzzo Contesa 2018 \u00a38.25 Wine Society, 13.5%.

In our uniquely tumultuous times there is no guarantee of either political success or failure, and pundits should be relentlessly reminded of this. Remember the hubris of May, and remember the nemesis that it met. Johnson\u2019s hard-right cheerleaders are currently intoxicated with triumphalism. But if Labour makes the right decisions now, a painful hangover may yet await. \u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",

Quitting the minute that album two of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/11/no-cities-to-love-sleater-kinney-best-albums-of-2015\">celebrated reunion</a> is complete seems like an odd move. We can only guess at the backstage drama, but if we study music\u2019s rich history of comebacks, can a band ever slot seamlessly back on track? The rock reunion story is as old as time: the wilderness was dark and tangled; the bassist has crippling Foxy Bingo debts and the singer\u2019s facing a ruinous sixth divorce settlement; everyone desperately needs this life-saving second shot to work, but there\u2019s no creative momentum or fresh identity; everyone\u2019s pulling in different directions. Take Kim Deal, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/06/black-francis-kim-deal-departure-the-pixies\">left the re-formed Pixies</a> to avoid tainting the legacy with new material, with subsequent Pixies albums bearing a Kim-shaped hole.</p> <p>Personal differences, too, never completely dissipate at the first whiff of a sizeable Festival Republic cheque. If you have ever got back with an ex you will know the pitfalls. Sure, they respect you now they\u2019ve stopped mainlining tequila and started paying you back that bail money, but they still hum Toploader in their sleep. Likewise, your old bandmates might have quit smack and had their egos punctured by failed solo careers, but once the comeback chips are cashed and the new album slog begins, the tiniest old niggle \u2013 the singer\u2019s aloof studio presence, the bus\u2019s rankling odour of 1993 \u2013 sets things back again.</p> <p>Some splits are so acrimonious that no amount of separate dressing rooms, limos or backstage meditation zones can heal the divide. The Verve\u2019s 1997 return was a powder keg of unresolved animosity, finally exploding after a year when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/richard-ashcroft\">Richard Ashcroft</a> lobbed a beer bottle at Nick McCabe\u2019s head; another go in 2007 saw a bust-up between Ashcroft and bassist Simon Jones after the very first gig. The 2006 East 17 reunion barely lasted one gig before it became clear, via a fist-fight, that not everybody involved was still resident at the house of love.</p> <p>Then there was Flowered Up guitarist Joe Maher who, according to drummer John Tovey, so messed up a major reunion show in 2005 that he was \u201ccarted out by St John Ambulance in a straitjacket\u201d. Actually, perhaps Weiss had the right idea after all.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Janet Weiss left the reunited Sleater-Kinney a brusque Dear John letter. \u201cThe band is heading in a new direction, it\u2019s time for me to move on,\u201d the drummer wrote, announcing she was leaving ahead of their new album The Center Won\u2019t Hold with the ultimate \u201cIt\u2019s not me, it\u2019s you\u201d. \u201cWe asked her to stay,\u201d came singer-guitarist Carrie Brownstein\u2019s response on Instagram, claiming Weiss loved the new album and describing the aftermath as \u201cwomen picking up the pieces\u201d. Traditional courtesy dictates that musicians either hand in their notice ahead of new album sessions, or at the end of a fractious promotional tour. Quitting the minute that album two of a celebrated reunion is complete seems like an odd move. We can only guess at the backstage drama, but if we study music\u2019s rich history of comebacks, can a band ever slot seamlessly back on track? The rock reunion story is as old as time: the wilderness was dark and tangled; the bassist has crippling Foxy Bingo debts and the singer\u2019s facing a ruinous sixth divorce settlement; everyone desperately needs this life-saving second shot to work, but there\u2019s no creative momentum or fresh identity; everyone\u2019s pulling in different directions. Take Kim Deal, who left the re-formed Pixies to avoid tainting the legacy with new material, with subsequent Pixies albums bearing a Kim-shaped hole. Personal differences, too, never completely dissipate at the first whiff of a sizeable Festival Republic cheque. If you have ever got back with an ex you will know the pitfalls. Sure, they respect you now they\u2019ve stopped mainlining tequila and started paying you back that bail money, but they still hum Toploader in their sleep. Likewise, your old bandmates might have quit smack and had their egos punctured by failed solo careers, but once the comeback chips are cashed and the new album slog begins, the tiniest old niggle \u2013 the singer\u2019s aloof studio presence, the bus\u2019s rankling odour of 1993 \u2013 sets things back again. Some splits are so acrimonious that no amount of separate dressing rooms, limos or backstage meditation zones can heal the divide. The Verve\u2019s 1997 return was a powder keg of unresolved animosity, finally exploding after a year when Richard Ashcroft lobbed a beer bottle at Nick McCabe\u2019s head; another go in 2007 saw a bust-up between Ashcroft and bassist Simon Jones after the very first gig. The 2006 East 17 reunion barely lasted one gig before it became clear, via a fist-fight, that not everybody involved was still resident at the house of love. Then there was Flowered Up guitarist Joe Maher who, according to drummer John Tovey, so messed up a major reunion show in 2005 that he was \u201ccarted out by St John Ambulance in a straitjacket\u201d. Actually, perhaps Weiss had the right idea after all.",

      "bodyText": "Labour has called for Boris Johnson to dismiss a new Downing Street staff member who has praised the work of a far-right, anti-Islam politician, while anti-racism campaigners expressed alarm at her appointment. Chloe Westley, who will lead Johnson\u2019s social media team at No 10, sent a now-deleted tweet in 2016 praising Anne Marie Waters as \u201ca hero\u201d. Waters, who has close links to the jailed anti-Islam activist Tommy Robinson, leads the far-right For Britain party. Waters co-founded the UK branch of the anti-Islam group Pegida alongside Robinson, has links to former BNP members and has described Islam as \u201cevil\u201d. She stood to be leader of Ukip before quitting the party to form For Britain. The party argues that the UK\u2019s Muslim population is causing a crisis, as it is growing rapidly and has beliefs that cannot be incorporated into a liberal democracy. Jon Trickett, the shadow cabinet office minister, said: \u201cIt is profoundly shocking that someone who holds these views should be at the heart of government. She should never have been appointed in the first place and Mr Johnson must now move swiftly to dismiss her.\u201d Matthew McGregor, the campaigns director of group Hope Not Hate, said: \u201cAnne Marie Waters leads a far-right party with virulent Islamophobia at its core. Calling her a hero was a serious error of judgment, as Westley later admitted. This appointment is deeply concerning.\u201d A Downing Street source confirmed Westley\u2019s appointment, but gave no further comment. However, a source close to Westley said she regretted the comment and that at the time she did not know Waters\u2019 beliefs, which she did not support or endorse, and believed were \u201creprehensible\u201d. Before the tweet was sent, Waters had been recorded while standing for Ukip in the 2015 general election calling for mosques to be closed and for a complete halt on all Muslim immigration to the UK. She was also barred by Ukip from standing for the party in the 2016 London assembly elections because of her role in Pegida. Westley has close links to the UK branch of Turning Point (TPUK), a pro-Donald Trump youth movement that has been accused in the US of anti-Islam views and connections to racism. She attended the first UK meeting of TPUK and is close to several of its members. The group has been backed by some Conservatives, among them Jacob Rees-Mogg and Priti Patel, both of whom are new members of the Johnson government. TPUK was co-founded by George Farmer, a Conservative donor and son of a Tory peer, who has been pictured socialising with Paul Joseph Watson, a senior editor at the far-right conspiracy theory website Infowars, and has frequently retweeted him. Farmer is no longer directly involved in TPUK. Farmer has called the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, a \u201cgrade A twat\u201d and a \u201cvirtue signalling cuck\u201d. In June, Westley appeared in a mock-comedy TPUK video called \u201cShit champagne socialists say\u201d. She moved to No 10 from the lobby group Taxpayers\u2019 Alliance, which claims to be an independent grassroots campaign representing British taxpayers but refuses to identify its donors. Last year, it emerged that the group, part of a rightwing network that promotes free-market capitalism around the world, received hundreds of thousands of dollars in overseas donations, including $100,000 originating from a billionaire-founded religious trust incorporated in the Bahamas. This week, Westley tweeted that she hoped a Johnson government would abolish the TV licence, start a \u201cbonfire of unnecessary quangos\u201d and launch a \u201cpro-freedom\u201d budget. Downing Street had no comment on the tweet. \u2022 This article was amended on 28 July 2019. An earlier version stated that TPUK is headed by George Farmer. This has been corrected.",

      "body": "<p>This week, the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-49084511\">British stunt performer Joe Watts</a> suffered a serious head injury on the set of the film Fast &amp; Furious 9, at Warner Bros Studios in Leavesden, Hertfordshire, after he reportedly fell 30ft (9 metres) from a balcony. He was airlifted to hospital and has been put in an induced coma. Production on the film was shut down, and the Health and Safety Executive is investigating.</p> <p>Stunt professionals are in high demand in the current climate of action-driven blockbuster films and increasing volumes of small-screen productions requiring cinema-standard action. Weary of unconvincing CGI and green-screen action, audiences are starting to want practical, unsimulated effects: humans doing spectacular stunts \u201cfor real\u201d. However, as the volume and complexity of stunts has grown, so has the risk factor.</p> <p>In Toronto last week, <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/titans-crew-member-killed-after-incident-at-special-effects-facility-1203272469/\">a special effects coordinator </a>on the television superhero series Titans died \u201cafter an accident which occurred at a special effects facility during the preparation and testing for an upcoming shoot\u201d, according to a Warner Bros statement. Warren Appleby was reportedly struck by a piece of a car that came off during the stunt test. In July 2017, the stunt performer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/24/amc-sued-wrongful-death-the-walking-dead-stuntman\">John Bernecker died from head injuries</a> on the set of The Walking Dead, in Georgia, after falling 20ft on to a concrete floor, missing a crash mat. A few months later, stunt rider <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/14/deadpool-2-motorcycle-stunt-death\">Joi \u201cSJ\u201d Harris was killed</a> when she lost control of her motorcycle on the streets of Vancouver while filming Deadpool 2. A former professional road racer, Harris was a novice stunt rider. The stunt required her to not wear a helmet.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s always pressure to do bigger, better stunts,\u201d says Ray Rodriguez, contracts manager for <a href=\"https://www.sagaftra.org/about/executive-staff/ray-rodriguez\">SAG-AFTRA</a>, the US union for screen actors, including stunt performers. \u201cIt is an ongoing escalation in terms of what is trying to be achieved, and I think that does have an effect on the level of danger. I also think the population of qualified stunt coordinators and stunt professionals has been stretched a little thin, just because of the level of demand. We do have concerns sometimes that we see stunt coordinators on set that don\u2019t have the type of r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that we are accustomed to seeing. It is an area of the industry where there has not been a lot of formal regulation.\u201d</p> <p>Alex Daniels, president of the <a href=\"https://www.stuntmen.com/stuntmens-association-of-motion-pictures/\">Stuntmen\u2019s Association</a> of Motion Pictures, based in Los Angeles, has similar concerns: while there have been vast improvements in safety compared with previous decades, the volume of stunts has also increased dramatically. \u201cIn the last 10 years, the number of stuntmen in Atlanta has grown from two or three dozen to nearly 1,000 because of the massive growth in volume of production in that region. What that has created is a situation of a greater number of stunt performers with less experience,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"edf87ef9a8eee96c87936e0582b90385d387aaa1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edf87ef9a8eee96c87936e0582b90385d387aaa1/76_170_2512_1509/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scene from Deadpool 2.

In May, shooting was suspended on the forthcoming 25th James Bond film after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/23/daniel-craig-surgery-ankle-bond-25\">Daniel Craig injured his ankle</a>. He slipped and fell while shooting a running scene in Jamaica, and had to be flown to the US for minor surgery. In August 2017, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/14/tom-cruise-injured-during-mission-impossible-6-shoot\">Tom Cruise broke his ankle </a>during a roof-jumping stunt in London for Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout. Production was halted for nine weeks, adding an estimated $80m to the film\u2019s budget.</p> <p>In the US, which has an estimated 3,000 stunt professionals, there is no central stunt body. The Stuntmen\u2019s Association is one of the largest of dozens of regional groups. It has 120 members, some of whom are semi-retired. Membership is by invitation.</p> <p>The picture is slightly different in the UK, says <a href=\"http://www.jimstunt.com/\">Jim Dowdall</a>, chair of the <a href=\"http://www.thebritishstuntregister.com/\">British Stunt Register</a> (BSR). Founded in 1973, the BSR prides itself on being the oldest and largest stunt association in the business. Dowdall, a veteran stunt performer, estimates the BSR has some 400 members in the UK, representing more than 90% of British stunt performers and coordinators.</p> <p>To qualify for the BSR, applicants are required to have spent a minimum number of days on a stage or film set and to be formally qualified in a minimum of six physical disciplines, including martial arts, horse riding, trampolining and stunt driving. \u201cIf you started from scratch, it would usually take two-and-half to three years,\u201d says Dowdall. \u201cAnd if you do succeed in getting on to the stunt register, there is no guarantee you\u2019re going to get a single day\u2019s work for the rest of your career. What you\u2019re getting is like a driving licence.\u201d</p> <p>The result of these exacting standards, says Dowdall, is that stunt safety in the UK is extremely high. \u201cThe kind of injury that Joe [Watts] has sustained this week is incredibly rare given the number of stunt days per year, which must run into the tens of thousands. But it\u2019s the one that goes wrong that everybody remembers,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The last such incident in the UK was in 2009, when David Holmes, a stunt double for Daniel Radcliffe on the Harry Potter films, <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/real-life-stories/harry-potter-stuntman-david-holmes-3279214\">injured his spine </a>and was left paralysed after a flying stunt went wrong. Dowdall points out that there has not been a British stunt fatality for nearly 20 years. According to a spokesperson for the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), \u201cthe film and broadcast industry in general has a lower incidence of RIDDOR [Reporting of Injuries, Diseases, Dangerous Occurrences Regulations] than many of the more \u2018traditional\u2019 industries\u201d. Since 2012, the HSE has investigated just six serious stunt-related accidents in the UK.</p> <p>The environment is collaborative, rather than competitive, Dowdall says. Bonds within the stunt community are strong, and knowledge is continually being shared, within the community and across the Atlantic, to improve safety. There are signs the US industry is adopting a more British approach. In 2018, SAG-AFTRA introduced new standards and practices for stunt coordinators, including mandatory basic training requirements, and a register of professionals who have carried out a minimum number of days of work.</p> <p>However, risk is still very much part of the territory. \u201cIt is not natural for a person to throw themselves out of a 30-storey building or roll down a flight of steps on fire,\u201d says Dowdall. \u201cBy definition, the word \u2018stunt\u2019 does not mean you can do something 100% safely, because then it is no longer a stunt.\u201d<br></p>",

      "body": "<p>Sunburn is an acute reaction in the skin after excessive overexposure to UV radiation. It causes direct damage to DNA, resulting in inflammation and the death of skin cells. Sunburn in childhood or adolescence can double the risk of developing melanoma skin cancer in later life, so it is crucial to avoid it.</p> <p>If you do become sunburnt, act quickly and get out of the sun. Cover up the affected areas with loose cotton clothes that allow your skin to breathe, and stay in the shade. Painkillers such as ibuprofen can help reduce inflammation and relieve the pain.</p> <p>Make sure you then cool your skin by applying a damp towel for 15 minutes, or take a bath or shower, keeping the temperature just below lukewarm. Make sure the shower has a gentle flow of water; if blisters are starting to develop, then a bath is preferable. Do not rub your skin with a towel, but gently pat it dry when you get out. Try not to pop blisters as this can lead to infection and scarring \u2013 they will settle by themselves after a few days.</p> <p>After the bath or shower, use an unperfumed lotion to soothe the skin. Aloe vera can also soothe and act as an anti-inflammatory. Sunburn can encourage fluid loss through the skin so make sure to drink plenty of water, which will prevent dehydration and help your body recover. Alcohol should ideally be avoided during this time as it will make dehydration worse. Treat your skin gently while it heals, and stay covered in the shade.</p> <p><em>Dr Anjali Mahto, a consultant dermatologist and a spokeswoman for the British Skin Foundation, was speaking to Ammar Kalia</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Sunburn is an acute reaction in the skin after excessive overexposure to UV radiation. It causes direct damage to DNA, resulting in inflammation and the death of skin cells. Sunburn in childhood or adolescence can double the risk of developing melanoma skin cancer in later life, so it is crucial to avoid it. If you do become sunburnt, act quickly and get out of the sun. Cover up the affected areas with loose cotton clothes that allow your skin to breathe, and stay in the shade. Painkillers such as ibuprofen can help reduce inflammation and relieve the pain. Make sure you then cool your skin by applying a damp towel for 15 minutes, or take a bath or shower, keeping the temperature just below lukewarm. Make sure the shower has a gentle flow of water; if blisters are starting to develop, then a bath is preferable. Do not rub your skin with a towel, but gently pat it dry when you get out. Try not to pop blisters as this can lead to infection and scarring \u2013 they will settle by themselves after a few days. After the bath or shower, use an unperfumed lotion to soothe the skin. Aloe vera can also soothe and act as an anti-inflammatory. Sunburn can encourage fluid loss through the skin so make sure to drink plenty of water, which will prevent dehydration and help your body recover. Alcohol should ideally be avoided during this time as it will make dehydration worse. Treat your skin gently while it heals, and stay covered in the shade. Dr Anjali Mahto, a consultant dermatologist and a spokeswoman for the British Skin Foundation, was speaking to Ammar Kalia",

      "body": "<h2>Monday</h2> <p>My passion for opera came about entirely by accident. It was late 1980 and my mother and sister had tickets to see Verdi\u2019s Otello. At the last minute, my mother fell ill and my sister asked whether I wanted to go in her place. My initial reaction was why on earth would I want to do that as I\u2019d only ever listened to pop music. But then she told me that the tickets had cost \u00a325 each \u2013 a small fortune back then \u2013 and I thought I\u2019d come along for the lig if nothing else. Within minutes of hearing Jon Vickers\u2019s opening Esultate I was hooked and by the end I knew I had found my perfect art form. Music, poetry and drama all combined into a gateway to the soul. Opera has been a constant in my life ever since. Much like therapy. And just as expensive. In the last couple of weeks I have been to see The Marriage of Figaro and La Fille du r\u00e9giment at the Royal Opera House and L\u2019arlesiana at Opera Holland Park. All three productions have been wonderfully staged and beautifully sung and I\u2019ve left each one believing \u2013 just momentarily \u2013 myself to be a little more hopeful and the world to be better than it really is. In such chaotic times when so much feels up for grabs, opera has never felt more necessary for my daily survival.

They couldn\u2019t have picked a better time and place, for downstairs there were so many classic pathologies on view in the form of Tory MPs waiting to crown their new leader, they could have easily have been mistaken as case studies who had been bussed in. One of the more unexpected Brexit bonuses that politicians seldom talk about is the increased levels of anxiety, despair and other neuroses among the general public. All of which has meant boom times for the nation\u2019s shrinks. My friend, Debby, who is a therapist, gets so many referrals she has to turn people away each week. Every cloud and all that. The actual coronation of Boris Johnson turned out to be a bizarre freak show masquerading as a jobs\u2019 fair with MPs elbowing each other out of the way to get in front of any passing journalist to declare their undying commitment to whatever they needed to commit undyingly to. When the actual announcement was made, everyone stood up and started clapping and roaring their approval. On and on the applause went. Because no one wanted to be the first person to be seen to stop. It was only sheer collective exhaustion that brought it to an end. The most disturbing sight, though, was Johnson\u2019s father, Stanley. Asked whether he felt proud, he replied that he did because the ambition had skipped a generation. It was as if a God-given birthright had been fulfilled. The sense of entitlement was breathtaking.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed63e1a8be7a4bc34fedb26748a5758b684a9437\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed63e1a8be7a4bc34fedb26748a5758b684a9437/0_84_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Hunt (left) and Boris Johnson react after Johnson is announced winner of the Conservative leadership race.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Hunt (left) and Boris Johnson react after Johnson is announced winner of the Conservative leadership race.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>After giving a speech outside Downing Street in which he claimed what was wrong with the United Kingdom was that half of us were too gloomy and needed to cheer up a bit \u2013 a strange way to unite the country, not least because there is nothing more guaranteed to make someone depressed than a delusional narcissist telling you to be happy \u2013 Boris Johnson went inside to appoint his cabinet. Not so much a reshuffle as an entire change of government. Never let it be said Johnson doesn\u2019t know how to hold a grudge. Out went the vaguely decent and moderately useless, and in came the completely venal and morally compromised. Imagine a cabinet so bad that even Chris Grayling, the Failures\u2019 Failure, chose to quit before he was sacked. A cabinet in which Gavin Williamson, who was allegedly sacked for leaking details of a national security council briefing, is reinstated as education secretary. In which the once pro-hanging Priti Patel, who was sacked for being less than candid about conducting her own private diplomacy with Israel, is put in charge of the country\u2019s security as home secretary. Still, there was an upside. After weeks of increasingly desperate brown-nosing, Matt Hancock did not get the promotion he craved. Instead he stayed at health. The most terrifying appointment was not even at cabinet level. Johnson has asked the former Vote Leave campaign director, Dominic Cummings, a man so toxic he can even fall out with himself, to be a senior adviser. Cummings may well have to restrict himself to No 10 though. Since he was found to be in contempt of parliament earlier in the year, he may struggle to get a Palace of Westminster pass.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6c278809045f9c53042d0f34cd6a313b61c8945\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6c278809045f9c53042d0f34cd6a313b61c8945/0_173_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson\u2019s at his first cabinet meeting as prime minister.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson\u2019s at his first cabinet meeting as prime minister.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: POOL New/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Thursday</h2> <p>One measure that Boris Johnson could introduce immediately to stop people like me being so gloomy is to install canned laughter speakers in every public place.

      "body": "<p>At 11.15am on a blustery spring morning, Lori Bennett stands on an exposed bluff on the remote south Atlantic island of St Helena, holding a gigantic, wobbling balloon. The wind is roaring, waves are churning up a swell and the sea air is charged with industrial hydrogen pumped from a nearby outhouse and used for blowing up the inflatable.</p> <p>The Met Office station manager, born in Northern Ireland and now living half a world away from his friends and family in Swindon, is a picture of calm in a drab boiler suit, old ski goggles and a flash hood he jokingly calls his \u201cStar Wars outfit\u201d. Moments later, he prepares to let the weather balloon slip from his fingers. Swinging it around, so that it lifts straight up rather than floating across the weather station car park, he is soon watching it jiggle steadily upwards before it disappears into the clouds.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been known to scare the life out of pilots,\u201d says Bennett, flipping his goggles off. \u201cBut out here in the middle of nowhere we don\u2019t get many planes.\u201d As well as launching the balloon in 45-knot winds that \u201ccan pull your arm off\u201d, Bennett\u2019s main worry is the hydrogen used to fill it. A spark of static could detonate the gas inside the warehouse and violently blow the doors clean off. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t walk away from that,\u201d he says, matter-of-factly.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It affects people\u2019s lives every day \u2013 we\u2019re the frontline in Atlantic forecasting</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Sometimes, it is easy to forget the lengths to which meteorologists go to bring us forecasts: telemetry instruments and synoptic codes don\u2019t really figure in the chitchat of TV weather presenters such as Carol Kirkwood and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/24/thomas-schafernaker-interview-weatherman-forecast-is-good-rhik-samadder\" title=\"\">Tomasz Schafernaker</a>. But as the climate crisis gains new urgency, our understanding of weather systems and patterns is more important than ever \u2013 and the weathermen working here are key to that. Among the last in the world to use such analogue methods as weather balloons, they are guardians of a dying art.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"143a1b403a25f3ad8833343d24ba619977e6ad69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/143a1b403a25f3ad8833343d24ba619977e6ad69/0_623_3750_4688/800.jpg\" alt=\"From left: Met Office weathermen Murray Henry, Marcos Henry and Lori Bennett.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left: Met Office weathermen Murray Henry, Marcos Henry and Lori Bennett.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Ormerod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Met Office has five other operational locations outside the UK (Antarctica, from October to April; Ascension Island and the Falkland Islands in the south Atlantic; Gibraltar and Cyprus), but none as unreachable as this tiny British overseas territory. The far-flung volcanic outpost doesn\u2019t just filter data into global forecasts to help predict whether your summer bank holiday will be a washout; it plays a vital role in tracking how our climate is changing over time. Added to that, the south Atlantic is a hotbed of geomagnetic activity \u2013 something many experts believe is a factor driving the climate emergency. Crammed into Bottom Woods station, little more than a humble portable at the end of the Earth, are complex instruments sounding a warning to anyone who will listen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1aa50bd68ed88ac96851d0c9ef18bd7e776071dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1aa50bd68ed88ac96851d0c9ef18bd7e776071dc/0_402_4198_5248/800.jpg\" alt=\"Launching the balloon at 11.15am.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Launching the balloon at 11.15am.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Ormerod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After precisely 90 minutes, Bennett\u2019s balloon reaches a height of 100,000ft (30,480m), where the air temperature hovers around -80C; the giant latex ball has stretched to the size of a two-storey house. It is used only once and will eventually burst somewhere on the edge of the stratosphere, but not before a mini weather station, known as a radiosonde and attached to the neck of the balloon, can relay back data on temperature, moisture, pressure, visibility and radiation. With Whitney Houston\u2019s One Moment In Time drifting out of the weather station\u2019s FM radio, it is the oddest science lesson you could imagine. Bennett sometimes imagines himself flying away with the blimp, he says, like the balloon salesman Carl Fredricksen and his cartoon house in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/oct/11/up-disney-pixar-film-review\" title=\"\">Disney\u2019s Up</a>: \u201cJust working in this quiet place gives me the freedom to dream.\u201d </p> <p>As the wind continues to whirl across the balloon launch site, the station manager introduces me to the rest of the team. <a href=\"http://sainthelenaisland.info/weather.htm\" title=\"\">St Helena\u2019s weather station</a> has been operational since September 1976.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Satellites only do so much. Honestly, there\u2019s still nothing as reliable as a land-based station</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Technical manager and islander Marcos Henry, 58, has been working at the station since leaving school at 16. He says the balloon procedure \u2013 one daily launch, always at 11.15am \u2013 is effectively the same as it was 43 years ago. The weather never stops, he says, although he notes that they used to launch two balloons a day, before cost-cutting measures started to bite. Sunday is now launch-free \u2013 and sometimes the four-man team are stretched.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7d3dfbf3cb05518070a1dc0f1c4391cdfc163b17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d3dfbf3cb05518070a1dc0f1c4391cdfc163b17/0_113_6480_3888/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hydrogen fills the balloon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hydrogen fills the balloon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Ormerod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today, Marcos is joined by 28-year-old Murray Henry, his island-born cousin, but not Garry Mercury, another (appropriately named) scientific observer; he is at the dentist with toothache. If there are any further staffing issues, one of the local binmen has been trained to act as a substitute. \u201cYou can\u2019t really put a value on what we do here,\u201d says Marcos, as a gritty light begins to spill through the clouds. \u201cWe have a collective responsibility to gather information, because it affects people\u2019s lives every day \u2013 we\u2019re the frontline in Atlantic forecasting.\u201d</p> <p>I follow the three men into the office, which is topped with VHF antennae and fortified with a clunky array of instruments, including a broken anemometer that once measured wind speed, an obsolete sunshine recorder and a bank of computers that transmit data back to Met Office HQ in Exeter. It feels like a place that exists in a different era. \u201cSatellites only do so much,\u201d says Marcos, with one eye on the readings coming in from the balloon. \u201cHonestly, there\u2019s still nothing as reliable as a land-based station.\u201d</p> <p>The St Helena unit is just one of 190 stations that make up the <a href=\"https://gcos.wmo.int/\" title=\"\">Global Climate </a><a href=\"https://gcos.wmo.int/\" title=\"\">Observing System</a> (GCOS), which is co-run by the UN, Unesco, the International Science Council and the World Meteorological Organisation to monitor activity in the Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere. As a key station in the south Atlantic, its data is vital for climatological studies, and its old-school methods have made the men unlikely rock stars on the island. \u201cEveryone wants to see the big balloon,\u201d says Bennett.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ace55631a48fe1e9faa0954ca84793d061a5f292\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ace55631a48fe1e9faa0954ca84793d061a5f292/0_341_5650_3390/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marcos Henry, adjusting a cable in the meteorological station\u2019s \u2018weather garden\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marcos Henry, adjusting a cable in the meteorological station\u2019s \u2018weather garden\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Ormerod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>St Helena is 5,000 miles from the problems of Brexit Britain, boasts black-sand beaches, Galapagos-like giant tortoises and all manner of indigenous birds. Yet that is mixed with reassuringly familiar snapshots of the UK: homes in the British overseas territory are decorated with pictures of the Queen, shops stocked with bottles of HP Sauce and cans of Irn-Bru.</p> <p>What also characterises the island is its topographical weirdness. With its odd mesh of rainforests and moon-like tablelands, the landscape changes abruptly from Yorkshire Dale to Jurassic Park, while the night skies are a blowout of frighteningly bright nebula. Small wonder Bennett \u2013 as well as Charles Darwin and Edmond Halley \u2013 fell for the place. As in the UK, there is plenty of talk about the weather, too.</p> <p>Have its forecasters noticed signs of the climate crisis? Bennett says he has little doubt. The wettest day since the weather station opened came last February, with 49mm of rain in just 24 hours. Marcos remembers a time growing up on the island when streams flowed freely; recently, they have dried and turned to dust. \u201cThere have been landslides and rock falls, too,\u201d he says. In the 90s, the island recorded 4,543mm of rain, a figure that soared to 5,148mm over the following decade. So far, from 2010 to this March, the weathermen have seen levels rocket beyond anything on record.</p> <p>One complex meteorological instrument under the team\u2019s watch is the Marvelesque <a href=\"https://www.cimel.fr/solutions/ce318-t/\" title=\"\">Sun Sky Lunar Multispectral Photometer</a>, which feeds into a global network to monitor pollutants in the atmosphere; growing levels are a clear indicator of how we need to change our habits. There is also an automated radionuclide station, which recently picked up nuclear particles from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/11/fukushima-toxic-soil-disaster-radioactive\" title=\"\">the Fukushima Daiichi disaster in 2011</a>, and continues to search for evidence of nuclear tests. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1916e93035f76504888de92e711a4fa359371675\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1916e93035f76504888de92e711a4fa359371675/0_454_3840_4800/800.jpg\" alt=\"An anemometer, which measures wind speed.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An anemometer, which measures wind speed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Ormerod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Across the island, in the air traffic control tower overlooking St Helena\u2019s airport, another Met Office scientist, Timothy Baker, is contemplating the same clouds. The meteorologist has been at his desk since 4am creating a forecast to ensure the safe arrival of the biweekly aircraft from Johannesburg, the island\u2019s principal connection with the outside world. (The airport opened for commercial flights in 2017.) His hope is that the bank of low stratus to the south will relent in time, otherwise the plane will have to turn around, 1,100 miles into its journey.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a complex place because of how quickly the weather can change,\u201d he says, as radio static from a console begins to cut through his words. \u201cFour seasons in one day? It\u2019s more like 12. It can flip from sunshine to thick fog within minutes. Sometimes, they can\u2019t see the fuel barrels on the apron [where planes are parked] from five metres.\u201d</p> <p>As I come to realise, the usual norms rarely apply here. Along with a colleague at Heathrow and a handful scattered around RAF bases, Baker is in the unusual position of being a weatherman embedded at an airport, working in tandem with the Bottom Woods team.

      "bodyText": "At 11.15am on a blustery spring morning, Lori Bennett stands on an exposed bluff on the remote south Atlantic island of St Helena, holding a gigantic, wobbling balloon. The wind is roaring, waves are churning up a swell and the sea air is charged with industrial hydrogen pumped from a nearby outhouse and used for blowing up the inflatable. The Met Office station manager, born in Northern Ireland and now living half a world away from his friends and family in Swindon, is a picture of calm in a drab boiler suit, old ski goggles and a flash hood he jokingly calls his \u201cStar Wars outfit\u201d. Moments later, he prepares to let the weather balloon slip from his fingers. Swinging it around, so that it lifts straight up rather than floating across the weather station car park, he is soon watching it jiggle steadily upwards before it disappears into the clouds. \u201cThey\u2019ve been known to scare the life out of pilots,\u201d says Bennett, flipping his goggles off. \u201cBut out here in the middle of nowhere we don\u2019t get many planes.\u201d As well as launching the balloon in 45-knot winds that \u201ccan pull your arm off\u201d, Bennett\u2019s main worry is the hydrogen used to fill it. A spark of static could detonate the gas inside the warehouse and violently blow the doors clean off. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t walk away from that,\u201d he says, matter-of-factly. Sometimes, it is easy to forget the lengths to which meteorologists go to bring us forecasts: telemetry instruments and synoptic codes don\u2019t really figure in the chitchat of TV weather presenters such as Carol Kirkwood and Tomasz Schafernaker. But as the climate crisis gains new urgency, our understanding of weather systems and patterns is more important than ever \u2013 and the weathermen working here are key to that. Among the last in the world to use such analogue methods as weather balloons, they are guardians of a dying art. The Met Office has five other operational locations outside the UK (Antarctica, from October to April; Ascension Island and the Falkland Islands in the south Atlantic; Gibraltar and Cyprus), but none as unreachable as this tiny British overseas territory. The far-flung volcanic outpost doesn\u2019t just filter data into global forecasts to help predict whether your summer bank holiday will be a washout; it plays a vital role in tracking how our climate is changing over time. Added to that, the south Atlantic is a hotbed of geomagnetic activity \u2013 something many experts believe is a factor driving the climate emergency. Crammed into Bottom Woods station, little more than a humble portable at the end of the Earth, are complex instruments sounding a warning to anyone who will listen. After precisely 90 minutes, Bennett\u2019s balloon reaches a height of 100,000ft (30,480m), where the air temperature hovers around -80C; the giant latex ball has stretched to the size of a two-storey house. It is used only once and will eventually burst somewhere on the edge of the stratosphere, but not before a mini weather station, known as a radiosonde and attached to the neck of the balloon, can relay back data on temperature, moisture, pressure, visibility and radiation. With Whitney Houston\u2019s One Moment In Time drifting out of the weather station\u2019s FM radio, it is the oddest science lesson you could imagine. Bennett sometimes imagines himself flying away with the blimp, he says, like the balloon salesman Carl Fredricksen and his cartoon house in Disney\u2019s Up: \u201cJust working in this quiet place gives me the freedom to dream.\u201d As the wind continues to whirl across the balloon launch site, the station manager introduces me to the rest of the team. St Helena\u2019s weather station has been operational since September 1976. Technical manager and islander Marcos Henry, 58, has been working at the station since leaving school at 16. He says the balloon procedure \u2013 one daily launch, always at 11.15am \u2013 is effectively the same as it was 43 years ago. The weather never stops, he says, although he notes that they used to launch two balloons a day, before cost-cutting measures started to bite. Sunday is now launch-free \u2013 and sometimes the four-man team are stretched. Today, Marcos is joined by 28-year-old Murray Henry, his island-born cousin, but not Garry Mercury, another (appropriately named) scientific observer; he is at the dentist with toothache. If there are any further staffing issues, one of the local binmen has been trained to act as a substitute. \u201cYou can\u2019t really put a value on what we do here,\u201d says Marcos, as a gritty light begins to spill through the clouds. \u201cWe have a collective responsibility to gather information, because it affects people\u2019s lives every day \u2013 we\u2019re the frontline in Atlantic forecasting.\u201d I follow the three men into the office, which is topped with VHF antennae and fortified with a clunky array of instruments, including a broken anemometer that once measured wind speed, an obsolete sunshine recorder and a bank of computers that transmit data back to Met Office HQ in Exeter. It feels like a place that exists in a different era. \u201cSatellites only do so much,\u201d says Marcos, with one eye on the readings coming in from the balloon. \u201cHonestly, there\u2019s still nothing as reliable as a land-based station.\u201d The St Helena unit is just one of 190 stations that make up the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), which is co-run by the UN, Unesco, the International Science Council and the World Meteorological Organisation to monitor activity in the Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere. As a key station in the south Atlantic, its data is vital for climatological studies, and its old-school methods have made the men unlikely rock stars on the island. \u201cEveryone wants to see the big balloon,\u201d says Bennett. St Helena is 5,000 miles from the problems of Brexit Britain, boasts black-sand beaches, Galapagos-like giant tortoises and all manner of indigenous birds. Yet that is mixed with reassuringly familiar snapshots of the UK: homes in the British overseas territory are decorated with pictures of the Queen, shops stocked with bottles of HP Sauce and cans of Irn-Bru. What also characterises the island is its topographical weirdness. With its odd mesh of rainforests and moon-like tablelands, the landscape changes abruptly from Yorkshire Dale to Jurassic Park, while the night skies are a blowout of frighteningly bright nebula. Small wonder Bennett \u2013 as well as Charles Darwin and Edmond Halley \u2013 fell for the place. As in the UK, there is plenty of talk about the weather, too. Have its forecasters noticed signs of the climate crisis? Bennett says he has little doubt. The wettest day since the weather station opened came last February, with 49mm of rain in just 24 hours. Marcos remembers a time growing up on the island when streams flowed freely; recently, they have dried and turned to dust. \u201cThere have been landslides and rock falls, too,\u201d he says. In the 90s, the island recorded 4,543mm of rain, a figure that soared to 5,148mm over the following decade. So far, from 2010 to this March, the weathermen have seen levels rocket beyond anything on record. One complex meteorological instrument under the team\u2019s watch is the Marvelesque Sun Sky Lunar Multispectral Photometer, which feeds into a global network to monitor pollutants in the atmosphere; growing levels are a clear indicator of how we need to change our habits. There is also an automated radionuclide station, which recently picked up nuclear particles from the Fukushima Daiichi disaster in 2011, and continues to search for evidence of nuclear tests. Across the island, in the air traffic control tower overlooking St Helena\u2019s airport, another Met Office scientist, Timothy Baker, is contemplating the same clouds. The meteorologist has been at his desk since 4am creating a forecast to ensure the safe arrival of the biweekly aircraft from Johannesburg, the island\u2019s principal connection with the outside world. (The airport opened for commercial flights in 2017.) His hope is that the bank of low stratus to the south will relent in time, otherwise the plane will have to turn around, 1,100 miles into its journey. \u201cIt\u2019s a complex place because of how quickly the weather can change,\u201d he says, as radio static from a console begins to cut through his words. \u201cFour seasons in one day? It\u2019s more like 12. It can flip from sunshine to thick fog within minutes. Sometimes, they can\u2019t see the fuel barrels on the apron [where planes are parked] from five metres.\u201d As I come to realise, the usual norms rarely apply here. Along with a colleague at Heathrow and a handful scattered around RAF bases, Baker is in the unusual position of being a weatherman embedded at an airport, working in tandem with the Bottom Woods team. Other airports rely solely on remote forecasts. On the day I leave, clouds are billowing over Diana\u2019s Peak, the mountain that looms to the west of the airport. The plane accelerates and all I can think of is the ends-of-the-Earth weathermen, enveloped in cloud, predicting sun patterns, rain showers and crosswinds. We have become so used to weather updates on TV, radio and phones that we have stopped seeing the act\u2019s grandeur.

He joins Whitehead and Jemisin as leading proponents of contemporary Afrofuturism, at a time when that movement is going mainstream \u2013 the film <em>Black Panther</em> took more than $1bn at the box office last year, and some of the world\u2019s biggest recording artists have adopted Afrofuturist stylings, from Rihanna and Beyonc\u00e9 to Janelle Mon\u00e1e. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What\u2019s happening is a shift in focus: Thompson is the\u00a0first African not living in the\u00a0US to win a\u00a0major SF/fantasy award</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In fact the movement, and black engagement with sci-fi, go back a long way. Samuel Delany has been writing sci-fi from the black experience since the 1960s (he\u2019s still going), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/27/funkadelic-10-of-the-best\" title=\"\">Funkadelic</a> were hymning their outer-space mothership in the 1970s, and the much missed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/mar/16/guardianobituaries.bookscomment\" title=\"\">Octavia Butler</a> wrote some of the most powerful sci-fi of the 1980s and 90s.

Writer Geoff Ryman, a former Clarke winner himself, points out that Thompson\u2019s success marks \u201cthe first time an African not living in the US has won a major sci-fi/fantasy award\u201d.</p> <p><em>Rosewater </em>is a distinctively African example of Afrofuturism: a portrait of Nigeria in 2066, extrapolated from the bustling and expanding society of today, but with its own distinctive flavour \u2013 intricate, sometimes hectic, spacious. Where white western cyberpunk tends to isolate its characters, gloomily alienated individuals moving through hi-tech future cities, Thompson\u2019s characters exist in vivid networks of kinship and friendship groups. The novel is as interested in protagonist Kaaro\u2019s love life (he is believably gauche in relation to his various objects of desire) as in his superhero skills. The far-fetched and the mundane rub shoulders in a distinctive and agreeable manner. Kaaro has employment as a kind of telepathic James Bond, but he also has a dull job in a bank. The alien incursion, around which the novel\u2019s titular city has been constructed, combines magic and science: healing the sick and bringing the dead back to zombie-life, but also provoking a hi-tech evolution in science.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"78000c808cbe340f1ff4b68e3f2a94c3e9727510\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78000c808cbe340f1ff4b68e3f2a94c3e9727510/0_0_2048_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Modern Marvel \u2026 Black Panther.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"527\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Modern Marvel \u2026 Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Chadwick Boseman and Danai Gurira in Black Panther.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marvel Studios</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thompson is the UK spokesperson for the <a href=\"http://www.africansfs.com/nommos\" title=\"\">Nommo awards</a>, set up to recognise excellence in African speculative fiction. He sees the current diversification of genre as driven by two main factors. \u201cSF is looking for new stories because of progressive thought, but also the need to avoid stagnation. Finding new ideas to feed audience appetites means looking everywhere, which in turn improves career prospects for marginalised creators. So [the Nigerian-American writer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/18/so-many-different-types-of-strange-how-nnedi-okorafor-is-changing-the-face-of-sci-fi\" title=\"\">Nnedi] Okorafor</a> happens, Jemisin happens, and <em>Black Panther</em> breaks the box office, because when you go looking, you find gold.\u201d Okorafor, award-winning author of the Binti trilogy, has recently had her work picked up for TV adaptation by HBO. \u201cWe persist not to entertain,\u201d says Thompson, \u201cbut because of an enduring love of genre, hence the Nommo awards, hence magazines like Omenana and Fiyah.\u201d</p> <p>Leila Abu el Hawa, director of the Kitschies, a prominent British prize for progressive sci-fi and fantasy, identifies other emerging voices. \u201cEvery year I\u2019m really excited by what we\u2019ll find coming from established authors and the new folk on the scene: <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Temi Oh</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/07/the-best-recent-science-fiction-review-roundup\" title=\"\">Agnes Gomillion</a>, Thompson and Justina Ireland to name a few.\u201d But she also recognises real inertia in the system. \u201cThese voices are not always easy to find, and the lack of diversity within publishing is endemic and not just limited to genre.

It is now a body of 170 published African writers, editors and publishers who nominate and vote for the Nommos. Ryman, who administers the awards, says the African Science Fiction and Fantasy reading group on Facebook has 3,500 members and is growing. \u201cIn the wake of the success of <em>Black Panther</em>, and the success of Africans like Thompson and Okorafor, almost every publisher now wants to be able to say they are open to speculative fiction by Africans. That can only be a good thing.\u201d</p> <p>But he qualifies his optimism: \u201cIf African writers are to end their dependency on being published in the west \u2013 and develop a big audience on the [African] continent \u2013 publishers here should consider hiring in African editors with experience in African Englishes and lives.

Rosewater is a distinctively African example of Afrofuturism: a portrait of Nigeria in 2066, extrapolated from the bustling and expanding society of today, but with its own distinctive flavour \u2013 intricate, sometimes hectic, spacious. Where white western cyberpunk tends to isolate its characters, gloomily alienated individuals moving through hi-tech future cities, Thompson\u2019s characters exist in vivid networks of kinship and friendship groups. The novel is as interested in protagonist Kaaro\u2019s love life (he is believably gauche in relation to his various objects of desire) as in his superhero skills. The far-fetched and the mundane rub shoulders in a distinctive and agreeable manner. Kaaro has employment as a kind of telepathic James Bond, but he also has a dull job in a bank. The alien incursion, around which the novel\u2019s titular city has been constructed, combines magic and science: healing the sick and bringing the dead back to zombie-life, but also provoking a hi-tech evolution in science. Thompson is the UK spokesperson for the Nommo awards, set up to recognise excellence in African speculative fiction. He sees the current diversification of genre as driven by two main factors. \u201cSF is looking for new stories because of progressive thought, but also the need to avoid stagnation. Finding new ideas to feed audience appetites means looking everywhere, which in turn improves career prospects for marginalised creators. So [the Nigerian-American writer, Nnedi] Okorafor happens, Jemisin happens, and Black Panther breaks the box office, because when you go looking, you find gold.\u201d Okorafor, award-winning author of the Binti trilogy, has recently had her work picked up for TV adaptation by HBO. \u201cWe persist not to entertain,\u201d says Thompson, \u201cbut because of an enduring love of genre, hence the Nommo awards, hence magazines like Omenana and Fiyah.\u201d Leila Abu el Hawa, director of the Kitschies, a prominent British prize for progressive sci-fi and fantasy, identifies other emerging voices. \u201cEvery year I\u2019m really excited by what we\u2019ll find coming from established authors and the new folk on the scene: Temi Oh, Agnes Gomillion, Thompson and Justina Ireland to name a few.\u201d But she also recognises real inertia in the system. \u201cThese voices are not always easy to find, and the lack of diversity within publishing is endemic and not just limited to genre. Things are changing, but slowly.\u201d Chair of the Clarke judges Andrew M Butler agrees: \u201cThe way we define SF, whether starting with Shelley or Verne or Wells or the pulps, is with white and predominantly male writers. We need new perspectives. That\u2019s part of the process of estrangement and familiarisation that great SF engages in.\u201d In 2015, Thompson took part in the discussions that established the African Speculative Fiction Society. It is now a body of 170 published African writers, editors and publishers who nominate and vote for the Nommos. Ryman, who administers the awards, says the African Science Fiction and Fantasy reading group on Facebook has 3,500 members and is growing. \u201cIn the wake of the success of Black Panther, and the success of Africans like Thompson and Okorafor, almost every publisher now wants to be able to say they are open to speculative fiction by Africans. That can only be a good thing.\u201d But he qualifies his optimism: \u201cIf African writers are to end their dependency on being published in the west \u2013 and develop a big audience on the [African] continent \u2013 publishers here should consider hiring in African editors with experience in African Englishes and lives. Then their efforts really will build on the success of people like Tade to provide a platform for African stories told by Africans.\u201d Ryman points to \u201cterrific novels by Africans\u201d such as Freshwater by Akwaeke Emezi, the story of a young Nigerian woman whose consciousness is fractured between different realities; The Raft by Fred Strydom, a high-concept meditation on memory and the nature of reality; Azotus, a sub-Saharan dystopia by Shadreck Chikoti; and Do You Dream of Terra-Two? by Temi Oh, a vibrant space adventure in which a young crew set out on a 23-year flight to a new world. But he acknowledges that the publishing world\u2019s centre of gravity remains western. \u201cAll the prizes and attention and impact come from being published in the west.\u201d Science fiction may be ahead of the curve, compared with some other genres. But it still has further to go. For now, however, the future looks bright.",

Sanjay Gour, co-owner with Nand Kishor of the <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">much-acclaimed Dastaan</a> in Epsom, Surrey (the pair previously ran the kitchens at the even more vaunted <a href=\"https://gymkhanalondon.com/\" title=\"\">Gymkhana</a> in London), goes a step further to stave off dry bread: \u201cPut the dough in a lightly greased bowl, apply a very thin layer of oil to the top and cover with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jul/12/clingfilm-alternatives-plastic-free-kitchen-aide\" title=\"\">clingfilm</a> \u2013 that will stop it from drying out and forming a skin.\u201d Like Gill, Gour gives his dough at least a 30-minute chill, but adds that it\u2019s advisable to leave the dough out to relax a little afterwards, so it\u2019s more pliable and easier to divide into balls.</p> <p>Gour says another possible cause of Lizzie\u2019s dry chapatis may be that she\u2019s dusting them with too much flour when shaping. \u201cObviously, you need <em>some</em> flour, because this dough sticks to just about anything, but if you use even a bit more than you need, it will dry out and you\u2019ll end up with dehydrated bread that\u2019s not at all nice to eat.\u201d If you\u2019re in any doubt as to how much is too much, give the chapatis a good shake or two when rolling, just to be on the safe side.</p> <p>Gill adds that if you can\u2019t get hold of chapati flour locally, you can make a pretty decent fist of it using plain or wholemeal instead. \u201cI did <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/23/20-best-vegetarian-recipes-part-1-ofm-chana-dal-ratatouille-romy-gill-jane-grigson\" title=\"\">a recipe for the Observer</a> a few years ago that\u2019s pretty foolproof.\u201d But, she adds, a different flour requires a different treatment: \u201cRather than refrigerating it, keep the dough at room temperature, because it does the opposite of chapati flour dough.\u201d</p> <p>Gill and Gour agree on another non-negotiable: brush one side of each cooked chapati with melted butter, then fold the bread over and cover with a tea towel. As Gill says, \u201cThis keeps them moist and soft, otherwise they\u2019ll be like cardboard before the whole batch is cooked.\u201d</p> <p>In India, many households make chapatis on a tava, or tawa \u2013 basically, a very flat, thin frying pan, often made of cheap steel or aluminium, designed for cooking all kinds of flatbreads, from chapatis to parathas and dosas (<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=tawa+pan+uk&amp;client=firefox-b-d&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=shop&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjGq4Cy9r7jAhUyrHEKHXA-BFUQ_AUIESgB&amp;biw=1744&amp;bih=1219\" title=\"\">you can pick one up online for as little as a fiver</a>) \u2013 but Gill says \u201ca basic pancake pan works just fine\u201d. Gour, however, prefers a flat griddle because, without the extreme heat of a professional hob, he reckons it\u2019s better for getting the requisite char and blistering. \u201cIf Lizzie\u2019s ever in Surrey,\u201d he says, \u201ctell her to pop over to Dastaan and we\u2019ll give her a quick lesson.\u201d I\u2019m no <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/derren-brown\" title=\"\">Derren Brown</a>, but somehow I foresee a fair few \u201cLizzies from Leeds\u201d dialling Gour\u2019s restaurant round about \u2026 now.</p> <p><em>Got a culinary dilemma?

Sanjay Gour, co-owner with Nand Kishor of the much-acclaimed Dastaan in Epsom, Surrey (the pair previously ran the kitchens at the even more vaunted Gymkhana in London), goes a step further to stave off dry bread: \u201cPut the dough in a lightly greased bowl, apply a very thin layer of oil to the top and cover with clingfilm \u2013 that will stop it from drying out and forming a skin.\u201d Like Gill, Gour gives his dough at least a 30-minute chill, but adds that it\u2019s advisable to leave the dough out to relax a little afterwards, so it\u2019s more pliable and easier to divide into balls. Gour says another possible cause of Lizzie\u2019s dry chapatis may be that she\u2019s dusting them with too much flour when shaping. \u201cObviously, you need some flour, because this dough sticks to just about anything, but if you use even a bit more than you need, it will dry out and you\u2019ll end up with dehydrated bread that\u2019s not at all nice to eat.\u201d If you\u2019re in any doubt as to how much is too much, give the chapatis a good shake or two when rolling, just to be on the safe side. Gill adds that if you can\u2019t get hold of chapati flour locally, you can make a pretty decent fist of it using plain or wholemeal instead. \u201cI did a recipe for the Observer a few years ago that\u2019s pretty foolproof.\u201d But, she adds, a different flour requires a different treatment: \u201cRather than refrigerating it, keep the dough at room temperature, because it does the opposite of chapati flour dough.\u201d Gill and Gour agree on another non-negotiable: brush one side of each cooked chapati with melted butter, then fold the bread over and cover with a tea towel. As Gill says, \u201cThis keeps them moist and soft, otherwise they\u2019ll be like cardboard before the whole batch is cooked.\u201d In India, many households make chapatis on a tava, or tawa \u2013 basically, a very flat, thin frying pan, often made of cheap steel or aluminium, designed for cooking all kinds of flatbreads, from chapatis to parathas and dosas (you can pick one up online for as little as a fiver) \u2013 but Gill says \u201ca basic pancake pan works just fine\u201d. Gour, however, prefers a flat griddle because, without the extreme heat of a professional hob, he reckons it\u2019s better for getting the requisite char and blistering. \u201cIf Lizzie\u2019s ever in Surrey,\u201d he says, \u201ctell her to pop over to Dastaan and we\u2019ll give her a quick lesson.\u201d I\u2019m no Derren Brown, but somehow I foresee a fair few \u201cLizzies from Leeds\u201d dialling Gour\u2019s restaurant round about \u2026 now.

      "bodyText": "Fosse/Verdon Sam Rockwell and Michelle Williams star as famed choreographer Bob Fosse and the woman often described as his muse, although in reality Gwen Verdon was as much an equal partner in their acclaimed work. This swaggering drama from US network FX traces their creatively fruitful working relationship, not to mention fractured marriage. Friday 2 August, 9pm, BBC Two Love Island: The Live Final After close to two months of bronzing, bed-hopping and endless utterances of the phrase \u201cIt is what it is\u201d, the dating show comes to a close. Who will succeed Dani and Jack as the winners, snaring some juicy brand partnerships in the process? Monday 29 July, 9pm, ITV2 Stacey Dooley: Face to Face With the Bounty Hunters The indefatigable Dooley explores one of the more lucrative businesses in the United States \u2013 that of the bail bondsman. How much money can be made by tracking down bail-skippers? And at what cost? From Wednesday 31 July, BBC Three Der Pass A bleak, snowy detective drama for the summer, this drama set on the Austrian-German border mines the \u201cjaded cop lumbered with a eager, naive junior colleague\u201d trope but places it in the world of ritual killings. Detective Gedeon and Ellie are dragged into a remote world of gruesome slaughter and archaic Alpine customs. Wednesday 31 July, 9pm, Sky Atlantic Pleasure Studies Canadian pop great Feist launches her own podcast but does so in an admirably ego-free way. The idea is that the stories here will find \u201cthe common ground under our common struggles\u201d. So Feist stays largely out of the picture, introducing guests and then leaving them to tell their own stories. The opening episode explores disappointment and how to deal with it. It\u2019s compassionate and uplifting fare. Podcast I Am the Night Chris Pine and India Eisley star in this intriguing new six-part drama, which works as both a commentary on race relations in 1940s America and an exploration of LA\u2019s most infamous cold case, the gruesome murder known as the Black Dahlia killing. Dark, atmospheric and menacing. Thursday 1 August, 9pm, Alibi This Is Football Football is not really a game that needs the hard sell. But this documentary series tells a mixture of stories \u2013 ranging from the magic of Messi to the role the game has played in Rwanda\u2019s post-genocide reconstruction \u2013 to get you in the mood for a new season that, barely believably, is almost upon us. From Friday 2 August, Amazon Prime Dear White People The provocative and intelligent campus comedy-drama returns for a third season. And with race relations in the US feeling more fraught by the week, it could hardly be more timely. Expect a new emphasis this time around, with gender politics being placed under the microscope and The Order beginning to flex its muscles. From Friday 2 August, Netflix Fear Is the Key One of the best of the many 60s and 70s Alistair MacLean adaptations, Michael Tuchner\u2019s taut thriller stars Barry Newman as a deep-sea salvage man hunting the villains (including Ben Kingsley) who shot down a plane containing his family. Nailbiting set-pieces include a courtroom breakout, a dizzying car chase and a sweaty final confrontation aboard a diving bell. Sunday 28 July, 10pm, Talking Pictures TV Ibiza: The Silent Movie After a debut at Glastonbury, Julien Temple\u2019s video essay on the history and meaning of the bacchanalian Mediterranean island heads to BBC Four. Made up of archive footage and dramatised re-stagings, it eschews dialogue for a banging house soundtrack curated by Fatboy Slim and is followed by Jeremy Deller\u2019s acid house history Everybody in the Place.

      "bodyText": "The French government has warned Boris Johnson against playing games with the Irish border after the new British prime minister demanded the ditching of the backstop. Am\u00e9lie de Montchalin, France\u2019s minister for European affairs, said both sides should avoid \u201cgames, gestures and provocations\u201d with just three months to go before the UK is due to leave the EU. De Montchalin said the French president, Emmanuel Macron, would hold talks with Johnson in France in the coming weeks but that the deal on the table would not be altered. \u201cIt has always been said that if the United Kingdom wants to leave the European Union and if they want to do it in an orderly way, what we have is the best agreement,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s two years of work between the teams of Michel Barnier in Brussels and the British teams\u2026point by point, pragmatically, realistically\u2026 \u201cWhat I would like to do in the coming weeks is that we can go through this stage and negotiate, calmly, calmly, (...) how we work afterwards. We want to work with [Boris Johnson] and most of all, we need it, it\u2019s a partner who will remain a partner after Brexit, it\u2019s a country that will remain very close to us\u2026 \u201cWhat is still to negotiate is the future relationship. We have to create a working relationship and not get into games, gestures and provocations.\u201d Johnson said earlier this week that he would not accept a deal that contains the \u201cundemocratic\u201d Irish backstop, the arrangement that would keep Northern Ireland under single market regulations and the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU until an alternative solution can be found to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. The prime minister has ordered Michael Gove to lead efforts to ramp up preparations for a no-deal exit this autumn if Brussels refuses to yield on the issue. But De Montchalin said adding red lines such as the \u201cdo or die\u201d exit date of 31 October \u201conly created tensions in diplomacy\u201d. There is a growing belief in Brussels that Johnson has no intention of negotiating with the EU, but is instead driving forward with a no-deal exit with the understanding that parliament will block him and it will be necessary to call a general election. Earlier in the day, one of the architects of the 1998 Good Friday agreement, the former Irish prime minister Bertie Ahern, expressed his concern about the danger of an accidental no-deal exit with potentially grave repercussions for peace. He said: \u201cI think we should all avoid trying to come up with simplistic solutions that this can all be done just by waving a hand or the stroke of a pen. \u201cIt is complex, it is difficult, it is new, and I think forcing a deadline into that is not bright, and I put it no stronger than that \u2026 I just don\u2019t see how such a tight timescale \u2013 [it\u2019s] nothing to do with the determination, or skill, or ability, or anything \u2013 just to agree a whole new agreement, it\u2019s just very hard to see how that can be done by Halloween.\u201d On Thursday, Johnson clashed with Jean-Claude Juncker, the outgoing European commission president, after demanding a renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement.

There\u2019s a freedom to this space that feels unpoliced by normal city rules. When I am kayaking they become an adventure playground, a way to get to part of the city you can\u2019t reach on foot. A place to meet fellows, human or otherwise, that you might not find elsewhere.</p> \n<p>The life down here is distinctly feral. There are men fishing, some for fish, some for metal. I\u2019ve seen a man using a huge magnet on a thick line of rope to trawl the canal floor for treasure. There\u2019s a trail of unwanted, rusting finds; a child\u2019s bike, a spanner, bolt cutter, a pulley, rod bars and what looks like a rotting safe, a screwdriver, endless bike locks and a horse shoe.

      "bodyText": "The roar of the road is receding with each step down and with it the light is changing; it is dancing, mirrored and then dappled in the ripples of the water. One layer down and the city has become an entirely different place. I, like many, am using the canal as a quiet cut-through. It smells different down here; there\u2019s the dankness of the water, for sure, but there\u2019s a wealth of green filtering the fumes from above. And the soundscape changes \u2013 song birds, the curious grunt of a bank of geese eyeing me and the dog warily, the lap of the water\u2019s edge and the groan of metal sidings that are there to repair the bridge. Today the canal is a shortcut to another part of the city, but the canals also represent an escape for me. There\u2019s a freedom to this space that feels unpoliced by normal city rules. When I am kayaking they become an adventure playground, a way to get to part of the city you can\u2019t reach on foot. A place to meet fellows, human or otherwise, that you might not find elsewhere. The life down here is distinctly feral. There are men fishing, some for fish, some for metal. I\u2019ve seen a man using a huge magnet on a thick line of rope to trawl the canal floor for treasure. There\u2019s a trail of unwanted, rusting finds; a child\u2019s bike, a spanner, bolt cutter, a pulley, rod bars and what looks like a rotting safe, a screwdriver, endless bike locks and a horse shoe. The archaeology of the canal in rusted orange. The horse shoe will no doubt date to the 18th century, when barges were towed by horses, ponies, donkeys and mules. The pulley from a warehouse loading bay and the bike locks symbolise something eternal about canals, they can hide a multitude of sins and secrets. The wildlife is feral, too, for however pretty and picturesque the towpath edge appears, fecund in dog roses and elder, thick with blackberries, buddleias and alders and waterlilies, it is also uncultivated, these wild things taking back the margins. Some are distinctly prosaic, dandelions and verges of selfheal, and others utterly unexpected \u2013 a bank of redcurrants dangling over the water, a thicket of figs full of fruit and an untamed apple orchard from thrown-away cores. This wild nature that sprouts from the cracks in the towpath and between the bricks in the bridges is in spite of us. For these are some of the most heavily polluted areas we\u2019ve created in cities. At the height of their construction in the 18th century, canals ran like trunk roads, zigzagging across the country, following natural contours but serving the greatest catchment area for trade purposes. You can roughly date a canal to pre- or post-1750s by whether it is narrow and meandering or ramrod straight and wide.

When the Guardian contacted SoCalGas with a request for comment on a story about Berkeley\u2019s natural gas ban, the utility did not respond. Instead SoCalGas appeared to have forwarded that request to C4Bes and a spokesperson for the group got in touch with a Guardian reporter. Still, C4Bes maintains that SoCalGas does not direct the group\u2019s position or activities. \u201cThe simple fact is that the gas company is one of 31, soon to be 32 board members. We have three officers, none of which are connected to the gas company, who steer the organization,\u201d said Jon Switalski, the executive director of C4Bes. \u201cWe\u2019ve received a lot of funding from a lot of other different sources. This is a very diversified coalition.\u201d SoCalGas and C4Bes don\u2019t deny the existence of the climate crisis. They promote the use of \u201cclean\u201d, \u201crenewable\u201d gas in the form of methane captured from dairies, wastewater treatment plants and landfills, and claim that using biogas in place of fossil gas would reduce emissions, and prove cheaper than full electrification. Earlier this year, SoCalGas announced a goal to replace 20% of its natural fossil gas supply with renewable gas as a step toward \u201cdecarbonizing the gas supply\u201d. Experts, including those who work in renewable gas and with C4Bes, say that simply won\u2019t work. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of folks who believe we can decarbonize the pipeline simply by replacing fossil natural gas with renewable gas,\u201d said the Dairy Cares executive director, Michael Boccadoro. \u201cI\u2019m not one of those people.\u201d Boccadoro is a C4Bes board member, but he does not agree with the organization\u2019s position on the potential for biogas, which is currently used mainly as trucking fuel. In the next five years, California is on track to have 120-140 dairy farm methane digesters capturing and harnessing fugitive, climate-warming methane \u2013 with the help of significant state grant funding. \u201cDairy biogas is way too expensive\u201d to use in homes or businesses, said Boccadoro \u2013 five to 10 times more expensive than fossil gas. According to emails obtained by the Climate Investigations Center, C4Bes and SoCalGas are aware of Boccadoro\u2019s \u201cimportant caveats\u201d, but continue to promote biogas as a better alternative to electrification. \u201cI am on record supporting this move by SoCalGas which will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the points made by Michael [Boccadoro] should be taken seriously and it deserves careful review,\u201d the chair, Matt Rahn, wrote in an email to C4Bes board members in March. Rahn also called for a \u201cfair, open, and transparent\u201d conversation about the future of renewable gas. In an interview, however, Switalski called Boccadoro\u2019s conclusions \u201cjust one individual\u2019s opinion\u201d. Switalski suggested that renewable gas could be subsidized like solar energy. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t pencil out and it doesn\u2019t make all that much sense from an environmental standpoint,\u201d said Boccadoro. \u201cIt\u2019s a pipe dream.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>I have been writing children\u2019s fiction for more than 10 years now, and still I would hesitate to define it; it is a slippery, various, quicksilver thing. But I do know, with more certainty than I usually feel about anything, what it is not: it is not exclusively for children. When I write, I write for two people, myself, age 12, and myself, now, and the book has to satisfy two distinct but connected appetites.</p> <p>My 12-year-old self wanted autonomy, peril, justice, food and above all a kind of density of atmosphere into which I could step and be engulfed. My adult self wants all those things, and also: acknowledgments of fear, love, failure. So what I try for when I write \u2013 failing often, but trying \u2013 is to put down in as few words as I can the things that I most urgently and desperately want children to know and adults to remember.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Children\u2019s books say: the world is huge. Hope counts for something, bravery will matter, wit, empathy, love will matter</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Those of us who write for children are trying to arm them for the life ahead with everything we can find that is true. And perhaps also, secretly, to arm adults against those necessary compromises and heartbreaks that life involves: to remind them that there are and always will be great, sustaining truths to which we can return.</p> <p>When you read a children\u2019s book, you are given the space to read again as a child: to find your way back, back to the time when new discoveries came daily and when the world was colossal, before your imagination was trimmed and neatened, as if it were an optional extra. But imagination is not and never has been optional: it\u2019s at the heart of everything, the thing that allows us to experience the world from the perspectives of others, the condition precedent of love itself. For that we need books that are specifically written to give the heart and mind a galvanic kick \u2013 children\u2019s books. Children\u2019s fiction necessitates distillation; at its best, it renders in their purest, most archetypal forms hope, hunger, joy, fear. Think of children\u2019s books as literary vodka.</p> <p>Above all, children\u2019s fiction spoke to me, and still speaks to me, of hope. The books say: look, this is what bravery looks like. This is what generosity looks like. They tell me, through the medium of wizards and sexy Jesus lions and talking spiders, that this world we live in is a world of people who tell jokes and work and endure. Children\u2019s books say: the world is huge. They say: hope counts for something, bravery will matter, wit, empathy, love will matter. These things may or may not be true. I hope that they are.</p> <p>WH Auden wrote, in an essay on Lewis Carroll: \u201cThere are good books which are only for adults, because their comprehension presupposes adult experiences, but there are no good books which are only for children.\u201d I would not suggest that adults read only, or even primarily, children\u2019s fiction. Just that there are some times in life when it might be the only thing that will do.</p> <h2>Five of the best children\u2019s books for adults<br></h2> <p><strong>The Paddington books by Michael Bond</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c97871cb789dc1f9535cb63f89dacf3424425145\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c97871cb789dc1f9535cb63f89dacf3424425145/0_114_1383_829/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paddington Takes the Test\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stories as parables \u2026 <em>Paddington Takes the Test.</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HarperCollins</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br> There\u2019s a vivid and obvious lesson in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/28/michael-bond-author-paddington-bear-interview-books-television-film\" title=\"\">Paddington</a>, about refuge. Paddington turns up at our door, with nothing to commend himself but his existence and his excellent hat, and we must take him in. We must cherish him, because he lives \u2013 and Michael Bond is telling us, like William Blake before him, that everything that lives is holy.</p> <p>But there\u2019s more: for Bond, I think, structure is a form of metaphor, and the stories can be read as parables. So each individual Paddington story usually has some kind of mishap: for instance, Paddington drops a sandwich; a man slips on it. Disaster! But then the man proves to be a burglar, and his stolen goods spill out at the bear\u2019s feet: triumph! The books tell us that if we zoom out we will see that inside each disaster there is a cog, propelling us towards potential goodness. Baked into the structure of the stories, small as they are, is Bond\u2019s colossal central truth: larger than the world\u2019s chaos are its miracles. Paddington asks us to trust, if only for a brief gasp, for the length of the book, in the world\u2019s essential nobility. The books are oxygen for those, like me, who doubt.</p> <p><strong>His Dark Materials trilogy by Philip Pullman</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82ac979326a49bdd58cdab19394e95c89eba32ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82ac979326a49bdd58cdab19394e95c89eba32ea/0_0_6144_4096/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dakota Blue Richards as Lyra, with Nicole Kidman, in The Golden Compass.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ferocious heroine \u2026 Dakota Blue Richards as Lyra, with Nicole Kidman, in The Golden Compass.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurie Sparham/New Line Cinema</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lyra, Pullman\u2019s ferocious heroine, one of the greatest ever written, a girl with quick wit and tooth-and-claw loyalty and a loose hand with the truth, voyages to the underworld.

      "bodyText": "I have been writing children\u2019s fiction for more than 10 years now, and still I would hesitate to define it; it is a slippery, various, quicksilver thing. But I do know, with more certainty than I usually feel about anything, what it is not: it is not exclusively for children. When I write, I write for two people, myself, age 12, and myself, now, and the book has to satisfy two distinct but connected appetites. My 12-year-old self wanted autonomy, peril, justice, food and above all a kind of density of atmosphere into which I could step and be engulfed. My adult self wants all those things, and also: acknowledgments of fear, love, failure. So what I try for when I write \u2013 failing often, but trying \u2013 is to put down in as few words as I can the things that I most urgently and desperately want children to know and adults to remember. Those of us who write for children are trying to arm them for the life ahead with everything we can find that is true. And perhaps also, secretly, to arm adults against those necessary compromises and heartbreaks that life involves: to remind them that there are and always will be great, sustaining truths to which we can return. When you read a children\u2019s book, you are given the space to read again as a child: to find your way back, back to the time when new discoveries came daily and when the world was colossal, before your imagination was trimmed and neatened, as if it were an optional extra. But imagination is not and never has been optional: it\u2019s at the heart of everything, the thing that allows us to experience the world from the perspectives of others, the condition precedent of love itself. For that we need books that are specifically written to give the heart and mind a galvanic kick \u2013 children\u2019s books. Children\u2019s fiction necessitates distillation; at its best, it renders in their purest, most archetypal forms hope, hunger, joy, fear. Think of children\u2019s books as literary vodka. Above all, children\u2019s fiction spoke to me, and still speaks to me, of hope. The books say: look, this is what bravery looks like. This is what generosity looks like. They tell me, through the medium of wizards and sexy Jesus lions and talking spiders, that this world we live in is a world of people who tell jokes and work and endure. Children\u2019s books say: the world is huge. They say: hope counts for something, bravery will matter, wit, empathy, love will matter. These things may or may not be true. I hope that they are. WH Auden wrote, in an essay on Lewis Carroll: \u201cThere are good books which are only for adults, because their comprehension presupposes adult experiences, but there are no good books which are only for children.\u201d I would not suggest that adults read only, or even primarily, children\u2019s fiction. Just that there are some times in life when it might be the only thing that will do. Five of the best children\u2019s books for adults The Paddington books by Michael Bond There\u2019s a vivid and obvious lesson in Paddington, about refuge. Paddington turns up at our door, with nothing to commend himself but his existence and his excellent hat, and we must take him in. We must cherish him, because he lives \u2013 and Michael Bond is telling us, like William Blake before him, that everything that lives is holy. But there\u2019s more: for Bond, I think, structure is a form of metaphor, and the stories can be read as parables. So each individual Paddington story usually has some kind of mishap: for instance, Paddington drops a sandwich; a man slips on it. Disaster! But then the man proves to be a burglar, and his stolen goods spill out at the bear\u2019s feet: triumph! The books tell us that if we zoom out we will see that inside each disaster there is a cog, propelling us towards potential goodness. Baked into the structure of the stories, small as they are, is Bond\u2019s colossal central truth: larger than the world\u2019s chaos are its miracles. Paddington asks us to trust, if only for a brief gasp, for the length of the book, in the world\u2019s essential nobility. The books are oxygen for those, like me, who doubt. His Dark Materials trilogy by Philip Pullman Lyra, Pullman\u2019s ferocious heroine, one of the greatest ever written, a girl with quick wit and tooth-and-claw loyalty and a loose hand with the truth, voyages to the underworld. At first, on meeting the harpies who guard the realm of the dead, she lies \u2013 tells them what she thinks they want to hear. The harpies go for her, dive\u2011bombing her and scraping at her skull with their talons. And so instead, she tells her own story: about pain, loss, hope and grubbiness, love and mistakes. The harpies listen. Lyra\u2019s companion asks why they did not attack, this time: \u201c\u2018Because it was true,\u2019 said No\u2011Name. \u2018Because she spoke the truth. Because it was nourishing. Because it was feeding us. Because we couldn\u2019t help it. Because it was true.\u2019\u201d The harpies make a bargain: if each soul has paid heed to the world and has a story to tell of it, and they tell it truly, they will be led through the darkness to the other side. Rigorous attention, wakefulness to the world\u2019s beauty, for Pullman, is what life demands of us. He has that in common with the philosopher Iris Murdoch, another writer I love, who decreed that attention was the foundation stone of love. We must learn, in Pullman\u2019s universe, to watch the world with intense and generous care. We must learn to tell stories, his books say, whether it comes naturally or not \u2013 because it is the best and sometimes the only way we have to exchange truth. Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak \u201cBut the wild things cried, \u2018Oh please don\u2019t go \u2013 we\u2019ll eat you up \u2013 we love you so!\u2019 \u201cAnd Max said, \u2018No!\u2019 \u201cThe wild things roared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth and rolled their terrible eyes and showed their terrible claws but Max stepped into his private boat and waved goodbye.\u201d There are as many interpretations of Where the Wild Things Are as there are people who have read it, and it means something very different when you are 30 from what it meant when you were three. I think it\u2019s about the ferocity of love; about how we devour each other, and are devoured. It\u2019s also about, I think, the stark strangeness of the world. Max returns home to find his dinner \u201cwas still hot\u201d. According to Sendak, his editors wanted him to cut or change that line, because it was impossible \u2013 or at least to edit it, to a more believable, \u201cand it was still warm\u201d. In an interview, he said: \u201c\u2018Warm\u2019 doesn\u2019t burn your tongue. There is something dangerous in \u2018hot\u2019 \u2026 Hot is the trouble you can get into. But I won.\u201d The world is, after all, rampantly strange. Children deserve books that are so too. One Dog and His Boy by Eva Ibbotson In a world that prizes a pose of exhausted knowingness, children\u2019s fiction allows itself the unsophisticated stance of awe. Eva Ibbotson escaped Vienna in 1934, after Hitler declared her mother\u2019s writing illegal; her work is full of an unabashed astonishment at the sheer fact of existence. In One Dog and His Boy, Hal, a child with everything he could wish for except love and care, releases five dogs from the cruel Easy Pets agency. He and his friend Pippa and the small sea of dogs go on the run to his grandparents\u2019 home. On the way, each dog finds the place in which they can be themselves; the Pekingese Li-Chee, who once guarded the temples of monks, lying at the feet of a girl in a foster home; Francine the poodle, a natural comedian, performing in a travelling circus. It\u2019s a story about finding your place and your people; about not pausing or doubting until you find them. It\u2019s also, like many of Ibbotson\u2019s books, a shot across the bow at an increasingly consumerist world; Hal\u2019s parents shower goods on him, \u201ca gift pack from Hamley\u2019s and another from Harrods \u2026 but in the whole of the house there was nothing that was alive\u201d. It\u2019s a sharp attack on the tide of acquisition that threatens to swamp us; to keep your neck above it, the book tells us, you must find something alive to love, be it beast or man, and hold on with both hands. Keep close, because the world will be cold, and frenetic and plastic, and only with each other will we make it. Peter Pan by JM Barrie I love Peter Pan for being so entirely itself, not a diluted version of some other, adult thing. It offers up to us its own defiant logic, for Neverland is the place of the free experiment of the imagination. \u201cOf course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John\u2019s, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingos flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it.\u201d And I love Peter himself: Peter is joy but he\u2019s also a threat: he\u2019s the id and the ego, the danger of being kidnapped by desire, he\u2019s dark and capricious.

He denies all the accusations.</p> <p>Started in 2004, Fox evolved the King Blues from a solo project to a hip-hop-influenced punk band. The group released four albums and received endorsements from the British chart-topping punk group Enter Shikari and Radio 1 before announcing their split in 2012.</p> <p>Fox produced a solo album in 2014 before starting a new version of the King Blues in 2016. Since regrouping, the five-piece have performed at festivals including Reading and Leeds, Download and Reeperbahn in Germany. They are known for their political lyrics and engagement.</p> <p>According to court claims seen by the Guardian, the women he is suing variously sent him a \u201cmenacing photograph and message\u201d, contacted his current partner about the claims, staged a protest at the band\u2019s performance and encouraged \u201cmilitant\u201d action against Fox.</p> <p>In the articles Fox was described as a \u201csexual predator\u201d, \u201cdomestic abuser\u201d and someone who turned \u201cthe feminism he raps about into a joke\u201d.</p> <p>Lawyers for Fox say the comments and actions amounted to a \u201ccampaign of harassment\u201d that was calculated to \u201ccause as much damage as possible to the claimant\u2019s [Fox\u2019s] reputation and music career\u201d.</p> <p>At a preliminary hearing in the high court last Tuesday, Julian Santos, counsel for Fox, told the court that \u201cintimate photos\u201d of his client had been uploaded on social media without his permission. \u201cWhile these delays [to the case] are experienced, the blogs remain online,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The judge, Mr Justice Julian Knowles, agreed that: \u201cThey are incredibly serious accusations. They have the potential to be immensely damaging.\u201d</p> <p>After the hearing Tamsin Allen, a solicitor at Bindmans law firm who represents three of the defendants, said: \u201cThe women all say they are speaking the truth and doing so to protect other people. There was no organised campaign: some of them had never met each other before the case.</p> <p>\u201cThe women felt it was in the public interest for them to speak out to warn vulnerable young women. That\u2019s why they have called their fundraising campaign \u2018Solidarity not Silence\u2019. They feel this claim is an attempt to silence them.\u201d</p> <p>The court claims say that, at one concert, a group of 10 protesters hoisted banners declaring: \u201cItch: Stop your abuse of women\u201d and \u201cCall it out\u201d. They were eventually escorted out by security guards.</p> <p>The documents also show a petition was started in order to pressure the 2000trees music festival to drop Fox\u2019s band from its lineup. At the Glastonwick festival in June 2016, one of the defendants, who is a musician, is said to have a delivered a \u201cseriously defamatory speech\u201d about him. That speech was then broadcast in a YouTube video.</p> <p>The articles or blogs amount to defamation, Fox\u2019s lawyers said, because they contain false allegations, for example, that he preyed on \u201cvulnerable and traumatised women\u201d, often those much younger than him, and that he kicked a pregnant partner in her abdomen. Another, it is claimed, falsely suggested he suffered from \u201csex and womanising addictions\u201d.</p> <p>As a result of the damaging claims, it is said, the band\u2019s promotional campaigns have been cut back and delayed. The women\u2019s action, Fox\u2019s lawyers said, \u201cheld itself out as a legitimate campaign to protect women whereas it\u2019s true purpose was to cause as much damage as possible to [his] reputation and as much distress and anxiety as possible\u201d.</p> <p>Fox has initiated legal action seeking aggravated damages for libel.

The case, which has reached the high court, is an example of the clash between Britain\u2019s defamation laws and the MeToo movement.

In the articles Fox was described as a \u201csexual predator\u201d, \u201cdomestic abuser\u201d and someone who turned \u201cthe feminism he raps about into a joke\u201d. Lawyers for Fox say the comments and actions amounted to a \u201ccampaign of harassment\u201d that was calculated to \u201ccause as much damage as possible to the claimant\u2019s [Fox\u2019s] reputation and music career\u201d.

On new track Prophet, it\u2019s easy to see why: pairing deep, breathy vocals with soulful, jazz-inflected production, the 20-year-old shows she has far outgrown internet hype.</p> <h2><strong>Sam Smith </strong><br><strong>How Do You Sleep?</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmYypVozQb4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PmYypVozQb4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>On the one hand, Sam Smith has the kind of properly good voice that can pull off any song in any style he chooses.

Face first \u2026 Recalling Japanese prints, it is all about the eyes and mouth. Against a mask of thick pale paint, her features are picked out in pink and lilac. She was recovering from illness at the time and, coupled with the tombstone-like inscription in the dramatic black backdrop, her face paint suggests makeup applied to corpses. Her own woman \u2026 Yet, looking away from her viewers \u2013 this painting was commissioned by the Finnish Art Society \u2013 she also exudes quiet authority: unknowable and rather beyond it all. Hold the light \u2026 While a keen fashion hound in life, here her clothes have a saintly austerity. Though she would enjoy another three decades as an acclaimed painter, Schjerfbeck had certainly suffered for her art. She was lame from childhood, and early poverty, bereavements, maternal disapproval and failed love affairs informed her outlook. Royal Academy of Arts, W1, to 27 October",

A Premium Battle Pass gives access to exclusive clothing and items.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is it so popular with kids?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>It's free, it's fun, and it has a very silly, offbeat sense of humour. While PUBG has a serious, realistic visual style, Fortnite: Battle Royale has very bright, almost cartoon-like graphics, as well as loads of ridiculous items and costumes, such as space suits and dinosaur outfits. Players can pull a variety of dance moves, and team up with a friend to compete as a duo or a squad. Participants can chat as they play using headsets and microphones.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there violence? And is it addictive?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Although Fortnite is a multiplayer shooter, it does not depict bloody violence. It takes lots of enjoyable gameplay concepts from more mature shooting games but places them in a non-threatening, non-realistic world. In terms of addictiveness, Fortnite contains nothing that makes it different from other action video games. It's more that the game contains many different elements \u2013 nice visuals, good shooting mechanics, an interesting building component and lots of support and interest from YouTubers \u2013 into one package that is free to download.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Several UK competitors will be present, including one of the favourites to win, Benjy \u201cBenjyfishy\u201d David Fish, who is competing in the Solo and Duo competitions for NRG Esports.

Up for grabs for the 100 qualifiers \u2013 many of whom are between 12 and 16 years old \u2013 is a total prize pot of $30m, the largest ever for an esports event. With more than 250 million players, Fortnite: Battle Royale has become one of the most popular video games in the world since its launch in 2017. The World Cup represents the title\u2019s entry into the lucrative world of professional games tournament circuits, where revenues are set to pass $1bn this year, due to exploding sponsorship, advertising and broadcast rights. Epic Games has arranged a three-day festival around the finals, with thousands of fans expected to attend. Saturday will see the Duos final with 50 teams of two competing, while Sunday features the Solo competition, pitching 100 players against each other. Both finals are played over six matches, with points awarded for match placement and number of kills. Winners of the Solo and Duo finals will receive $3m each. Competitors are coming from all over the world after winning a series of open, online heats, which also offered hundreds of thousands of dollars in prize money. There are no women among the finalists, and most competitors are under the age of 20. Many are part of professional gaming teams such as Faze, Envy and NRG, which provide managers and training facilities for star players. Several UK competitors will be present, including one of the favourites to win, Benjy \u201cBenjyfishy\u201d David Fish, who is competing in the Solo and Duo competitions for NRG Esports. The 15-year-old told ESPN that if he wins, he will buy a house for his family.

In the 1970s, \u201clezza\u201d was the worst thing anyone could say about you, and my mother described homosexuality as \u201cunnatural\u201d. I did everything I could to appear straight, hoping it was just a phase.</p> <p>By the time I hit 15, that hope was fading. Against my family\u2019s wishes, I became a born-again Christian, thinking it might help. The local church was a warm, kind community.

I would have to fast for three days and repent my attraction to girls. I didn\u2019t tell anyone about the exorcism; but I put immense weight on it and on the hope that it would help me lead a normal life.</p> <p>When I arrived at the pastor\u2019s house, there was a sombre atmosphere. The furniture had been pushed back, except for one wooden chair in the middle of the room. My pastor was there, with two male assistants and Sid, the exorcism expert. He was a tiny man who sometimes came to our church to pray for people with all sorts of maladies.</p> <p>Sid told me they would get the demon out, but this depended on my being repentant. If they failed, I would go to hell. All the men started praying in tongues. They held my shoulders, shaking me and shouting at the demon, commanding it, ironically, to \u201ccome out\u201d. I was crying because four men were shouting at me and also because of the years of anxiety, grief and loneliness I had suffered. It seemed to go on for hours. At one point, my pastor\u2019s wife appeared, with a pot of tea. Everything stopped, and I was grateful for the rest and the biscuits. Then Sid told everyone to drink up so they could have another go.</p> <p>After more of their shouting, I lunged forward and tried to strangle Sid, acting out what I thought they wanted to see. They shouted louder: \u201cIt\u2019s coming out, it\u2019s coming out!\u201d</p> <p>I think the exorcism took about two and a half hours. I asked Sid how it had gone. \u201cNot well,\u201d he said and told me that I had seven demons \u2013 and while they were praying, five more had come in. He said that I should get myself a boyfriend and start wearing more ladylike clothes. They looked sad and worried, and I was beyond despair. I decided to leave the church.</p> <p>In my third year of university, I spent a year abroad in Italy. On a retreat at a Catholic monastery, I resolved to become a nun; I would dedicate myself to God. I flew back to London to finish my degree, intending to return the following year to take my vows.</p> <p>On the day I was due to go back to Italy, I felt uneasy. I flipped open my Bible and it landed on a verse that said: \u201cHe walks in the way of his father David, neither turning to the left nor to the right.\u201d My interpretation was that I had to live in the real world, rather than run away and hide. I unpacked my suitcase.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/12/experience-i-tunnelled-under-the-berlin-wall\">Experience: I tunnelled under the Berlin Wall</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The fear that the devil was inside me, plus my internalised homophobia, kept me in the closet until I was in my late 40s. I was working as a teacher in London, but for one weekend every month I flew to Los Angeles to study for a master\u2019s in spiritual psychology. For two years I was surrounded by people who didn\u2019t care if I was gay or not; their only religion was authenticity. When the course ended, I thought: I can\u2019t be in the closet any more.

Sid told me they would get the demon out, but this depended on my being repentant. If they failed, I would go to hell. All the men started praying in tongues. They held my shoulders, shaking me and shouting at the demon, commanding it, ironically, to \u201ccome out\u201d. I was crying because four men were shouting at me and also because of the years of anxiety, grief and loneliness I had suffered. It seemed to go on for hours. At one point, my pastor\u2019s wife appeared, with a pot of tea. Everything stopped, and I was grateful for the rest and the biscuits. Then Sid told everyone to drink up so they could have another go. After more of their shouting, I lunged forward and tried to strangle Sid, acting out what I thought they wanted to see. They shouted louder: \u201cIt\u2019s coming out, it\u2019s coming out!\u201d I think the exorcism took about two and a half hours. I asked Sid how it had gone. \u201cNot well,\u201d he said and told me that I had seven demons \u2013 and while they were praying, five more had come in. He said that I should get myself a boyfriend and start wearing more ladylike clothes. They looked sad and worried, and I was beyond despair. I decided to leave the church. In my third year of university, I spent a year abroad in Italy. On a retreat at a Catholic monastery, I resolved to become a nun; I would dedicate myself to God. I flew back to London to finish my degree, intending to return the following year to take my vows. On the day I was due to go back to Italy, I felt uneasy. I flipped open my Bible and it landed on a verse that said: \u201cHe walks in the way of his father David, neither turning to the left nor to the right.\u201d My interpretation was that I had to live in the real world, rather than run away and hide. I unpacked my suitcase. The fear that the devil was inside me, plus my internalised homophobia, kept me in the closet until I was in my late 40s. I was working as a teacher in London, but for one weekend every month I flew to Los Angeles to study for a master\u2019s in spiritual psychology. For two years I was surrounded by people who didn\u2019t care if I was gay or not; their only religion was authenticity. When the course ended, I thought: I can\u2019t be in the closet any more. It was as if the lid came off. I quit my job and moved to LA, where I wrote a one-woman show based on my experiences called A Very British Lesbian, which I\u2019m taking to this year\u2019s Edinburgh Fringe. I\u2019m no longer religious. I do yoga, I light candles, I have a relationship with a higher power. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d call myself an activist, but the show is a rallying cry \u2013 not just for gay people, but for anybody who is living a muted life; because we\u2019re only here for a short time. \u2022 As told to Lisa Henderson Do you have an experience to share?

      "bodyText": "The mass eviction of asylum seekers in Glasgow by the private housing provider Serco has begun, the Guardian has learned. The action had been threatened for more than a year and is being challenged in the courts. The Scottish Refugee Council said it had been contacted by two men who were made destitute after the locks were changed at their accommodation and their property removed by Serco. Both men, an Iranian and an Iraqi, are working with immigration lawyers to see if a fresh asylum claim is possible. Earlier in July a coalition of refugee and housing charities, including Shelter Scotland, urged Serco to halt the evictions until litigation was completed, describing the plan to remove hundreds of refused asylum seekers as \u201cinhumane\u201d and warning that it would lead to a homelessness crisis in the city. The Scottish Refugee Council is concerned that Serco may be targeting isolated and vulnerable individuals; neither of the first two evictees were in contact with refugee services or aware of the possibility of obtaining a court order to halt their evictions. Serco first announced the plan to evict 300 asylum seekers in Glasgow \u2013 all of whom have been told they cannot stay in the UK \u2013 last July, but put the action on hold following widespread condemnation. The housing provider, whose contract with the Home Office runs out at the end of August, announced in June that it was restarting the plans, guaranteeing that no more than 30 people would be issued with lock-changing notices in any week, that tenants would be given at least 21 days\u2019 notice to make alternative arrangements, and that no children would be left homeless.

      "body": "<p>On the one hand, the massive imbalances of wealth within football are a terrible thing. On the other, they can lead to deliciously ludicrous morality tales. The hero is lured to a faraway kingdom by promises of unimaginable wealth and other heroes to hero around with. The hero heroes but perhaps not as heroically as some would like. Then the king decides he wants a new hero and that means this hero must leave. But this hero enjoys his luxurious life and does not want to go anywhere where there may be fewer other heroes to hero with and where the pillows may be less silken and the fairways less lush. Impasse ensues.</p> \n<p>This could be about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/09/neymar-psg-split-champions-league-ballon-dor-divorce-barcelona\" title=\"\">Neymar and Paris Saint-Germain</a> but it is about Gareth Bale and Real Madrid \u2013 and the fact the pattern repeats with such contrasting personalities suggests the problem is systemic rather than being about individuals. The culture of superclubs has led to a cult of superplayers and the problem with superplayers is that only superclubs and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/21/zinedine-zidane-says-gareth-bale-could-leave-real-madrid-in-a-matter-of-days-football\" title=\"\">Chinese franchises can afford them</a>. When one tires of the other, there are very few places for the superplayer to go.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/26/gareth-bale-set-to-join-china-jiangsu-suning-on-1m-a-week-contract-real-madrid-football\">Gareth Bale set to join Jiangsu Suning on \u00a31m-a-week contract \u2013 reports</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Even after the cruciate injury suffered by Marco Asensio this week,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/23/arsenal-real-madrid-friendly-gareth-bale\" title=\"\"> Bale probably will end up leaving Real this summer</a>, with it reported on Friday night that he is close to joining Chinese Super League side Jiangsu Suning on a \u00a31m per week contract. Bale is currently sitting on a deal worth \u00a3600,000 per week for the next three years. But none of that explains the bitterness that now exists between Bale on one side and Real\u2019s manager, Zinedine Zidane, and fans on the other.</p> \n<p>The argument that Bale has not integrated into Spanish life feels a little hollow. There are plenty of players who struggle with a new language who have been successful. And so what if he plays a lot of golf? There are many more damaging extracurricular activities that a footballer could indulge. Complaints about lifestyle tend to be symptomatic of a deeper dissatisfaction.</p> \n<p>Yet, on the face of it, Bale\u2019s time at Real has been a success.

      "bodyText": "On the one hand, the massive imbalances of wealth within football are a terrible thing. On the other, they can lead to deliciously ludicrous morality tales. The hero is lured to a faraway kingdom by promises of unimaginable wealth and other heroes to hero around with. The hero heroes but perhaps not as heroically as some would like. Then the king decides he wants a new hero and that means this hero must leave. But this hero enjoys his luxurious life and does not want to go anywhere where there may be fewer other heroes to hero with and where the pillows may be less silken and the fairways less lush. Impasse ensues. This could be about Neymar and Paris Saint-Germain but it is about Gareth Bale and Real Madrid \u2013 and the fact the pattern repeats with such contrasting personalities suggests the problem is systemic rather than being about individuals. The culture of superclubs has led to a cult of superplayers and the problem with superplayers is that only superclubs and Chinese franchises can afford them. When one tires of the other, there are very few places for the superplayer to go. Even after the cruciate injury suffered by Marco Asensio this week, Bale probably will end up leaving Real this summer, with it reported on Friday night that he is close to joining Chinese Super League side Jiangsu Suning on a \u00a31m per week contract. Bale is currently sitting on a deal worth \u00a3600,000 per week for the next three years. But none of that explains the bitterness that now exists between Bale on one side and Real\u2019s manager, Zinedine Zidane, and fans on the other. The argument that Bale has not integrated into Spanish life feels a little hollow. There are plenty of players who struggle with a new language who have been successful. And so what if he plays a lot of golf? There are many more damaging extracurricular activities that a footballer could indulge. Complaints about lifestyle tend to be symptomatic of a deeper dissatisfaction. Yet, on the face of it, Bale\u2019s time at Real has been a success. There have been injuries \u2013 72 games missed through 17 separate problems in his six years at the Bernab\u00e9u \u2013 but he has still managed 133 league starts. More than that, he has scored vital goals \u2013 three in Champions League finals, two of them vital game-changing strikes, and one of them arguably the greatest goal scored in a major final. Perhaps it is true Bale never quite got going in Spain, that there have been flashes and hints rather than sustained excellence, but equally there is more than enough material there to build a cult hero. There was enough for Real to offer him a six-year deal worth in excess of \u00a3150m in October 2016. The problem has perhaps been twofold: expectation and the absurd incoherence that so often afflicts Florentino P\u00e9rez\u2019s content generator. Bale arrived in 2013 for a world-record fee as the designated successor to the previous holder of that accolade, Cristiano Ronaldo. But not only was he never the new Ronaldo, the old Ronaldo turned out to be nowhere near obsolescence as it had appeared. That created an immediate tactical problem. Bale had excelled in his final season at Tottenham cutting in from the left but that was the space occupied by Ronaldo. Bale ended up playing mainly on the right, an awkward accommodation that immediately raised the question of why a club would pay world-record fees for two players who wanted to play in the same position. As Ronaldo aged and stripped back his role back, so the opportunities for Bale to play as he had at Spurs became increasingly limited. What he needed was a 4-3-3 with a centre-forward who got out of the way, creating space for him to accelerate into. What he got was a 4-4-2 that generated much of its width from full-back and demanded a more patient technical style from its midfielders. In six years, Real have spent around \u00a3300m on Bale in transfer fee and wages and yet have almost never played him in the role in which he impressed them. Which is not necessarily to paint Bale as a victim, particularly if there is substance to the rumours Zidane\u2019s increasingly militant stance has been prompted by Bale\u2019s truculence in the latter part of last season. It is not as though Bale seized the opportunity when Ronaldo had finally cleared out of the way. Equally, while he cannot be blamed for insisting his contract be honoured, there is something a little depressing that that seems more of a priority than using his talents at the highest possible level for the handful of seasons that remain for him as a player. It is surely not how the Bale of that famous childhood photo, clad in his Real replica shirt, grinning awkwardly and raising his fingers in a victory sign, hoped it would turn out. Fundamentally, though, this is a problem of Real\u2019s making: if you treat players like commodities, you cannot be surprised if they come to regard themselves as value-creation machines. The situation could be sad but really it is just silly: what actually, other than the dignity of the game, the dreams of children and the sense of sport as a noble pursuit in and of itself, has been lost?",

Protesters held up signs designed to look like customs notices and played tongue-in-cheek audio messages resembling in-flight safety instructions. Hong Kong has been gripped by nearly two months of demonstrations by residents calling for democratic reforms and the withdrawal of a controversial extradition bill. Clashes between protesters and police and other parties have become increasingly violent. Friday\u2019s demonstration against the government and police, who have been accused of colluding with triads (organised crime groups) to suppress protests, was also aimed at urging international visitors to pay attention to Hong Kong. A group of students held signs in English, Japanese, and Korean calling on \u201cinternational friends for help standing up to the Hong Kong government\u201d. Many held signs in red and white, designed to look like warning flags raised by police before firing on demonstrators, which said: \u201cTourist warning: do not trust the police or the government.\u201d Authorities are bracing for days of protests, as public anger towards the police and the government of the chief executive, Carrie Lam, reaches new heights. After an attack on commuters last Sunday by suspected organised crime groups left 45 people hospitalised, dozens of groups planned rallies and issued public petitions. On Saturday, demonstrators plan to rally in Yuen Long, in Hong Kong\u2019s New Territories, where last week\u2019s attack took place, in defiance of a police ban.

Lam last spoke to the public on Monday when she condemned the attack in Yuen Long but went on to criticise protesters for defacing the building of China\u2019s representative office in protests last weekend. In a ruling likely to add to protesters grievances, Hong Kong\u2019s appeal court on Friday overturned the conviction of two police officers previously found guilty of beating a protester in an alley during pro-democracy demonstrations in 2014. On Friday, Reuters reported that it had obtained a recording from an official from China\u2019s representative office calling on residents in Yuen Long to drive away protesters. \u201cWe won\u2019t allow them to come to Yuen Long to cause trouble,\u201d Li Jiyi, the director of the central government liaison\u2019s local district office said at a banquet for villagers in the New Territories, according to Reuters.

In a press briefing on Friday, the chief secretary for Hong Kong, Matthew Cheung Kin-chung, reminded demonstrators planning to go to Yuen Long that if their appeal was not accepted their actions would be illegal. He called on demonstrators to \u201cpeacefully and rationally\u201d express themselves, to \u201cstay away from violence\u201d and \u201crespect the life of the residents of Yuen Long\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>When Tonia Antoniazzi stood up in the House of Commons to talk about the risks of 5G, she admitted that \u201cinitiating a conversation \u2026 has had members of my own team and family telling me that it is all made up.\u201d But the Labour MP was undeterred, securing a debate in parliament and the support of a handful of Labour and SNP colleagues to ask about the \u201cunintended consequences\u201d of the latest upgrade to the nation\u2019s mobile phone network.</p> \n<p>The government\u2019s response \u2013 that there was no evidence of any risk, and that it anticipated \u201cno negative effects on public health\u201d \u2013 was, Antoniazzi said, \u201cfar from reassuring\u201d.</p> \n<p>Junk science is a fact of life. Between hyperbolic reporting of careful studies, careful reporting of hyperbolic studies and \u201ccommon sense\u201d dismissal of any studies at all, it is getting harder and harder for non-experts to separate reasonable concerns from medical misinformation.</p> \n<p>So as Britain\u2019s carriers lined up to launch their 5G networks this summer, they were expecting some resistance. Fears over the health effects of mobile telephony are widespread, ranging from fairly limited concerns about potential long-term risks of living or growing up in close proximity to masts, to claims of full-blown \u201celectromagnetic sensitivity\u201d, which supposedly manifests as a plethora of symptoms from headaches to immunodeficiencies.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"915f76c8-c4a7-47fb-a8bd-d4098bd7f6cc\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>5G is the next generation mobile phone network and it promises much higher connection speeds, lower latency (response times) and to be more reliable than the creaking&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/4g\">4G</a>&nbsp;networks we have now.</p>\n    <p>It will be much faster, with download speeds 5-10 times quicker than 4G to start with, meaning a movie will download in seconds rather than minutes. Over the next few years it should become even faster, as the technology matures. It will also have lower latency, the time it takes for something to happen: tap a link and the download will start faster.</p>\n    <p>But perhaps the most important thing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/5g\">5G</a>&nbsp;will immediately do for users is increase the carrying capacity of the masts, meaning more people can connect at the same time.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/samuel-gibbs\"><b>Samuel Gibbs</b></a>, <i>consumer technology editor&nbsp;</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But what greeted them wasn\u2019t just the same collection of alternative medicine proponents and anti-infrastructure nimbys who reliably oppose every new launch.</p> \n<p>\u201cWere we surprised by the existence of opposition? No,\u201d says EE\u2019s head of technology communications, Howard Jones. \u201cWere we surprised by the scale, and the organised nature of it? Yes \u2026 It\u2019s alarmist, very sensationalist and designed to scare.\u201d</p> \n<p>Jones is firm: there is absolutely no evidence that 5G, or any other part of the network, is dangerous. \u201cThe wavelengths that 5G uses and will use are all entirely safe and have been in research and testing for decades. It\u2019s a red herring to say it\u2019s a new technology and therefore hasn\u2019t been tested,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>To fully debunk the health fears around 5G is impossible: there is no consistent set of claims being made, few explicit studies being cited, and a surfeit of scientific terminology being used in ways that obscure rather than illuminate. Not a single expert the Guardian spoke to believed there was any reliable evidence of harm from 5G or any other part of the publicly licensed broadcast spectrum. And the carriers are emphatic that, in the words of Three UK, \u201cfrom a health and safety perspective, 5G deployment is no different to any other mobile technology \u2026 no harmful levels of radiation are emitted.\u201d</p> \n<p>But there are themes that recur again and again.</p> \n<p>At the far end of the range is belief that the 5G rollout is a vast mind control experiment, a successor to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra\">the CIA\u2019s MKUltra experiments</a>. There is the fear that 5G will result in a great increase in the number of masts, or the amount of energy sent over the radio spectrum, in a way that will prove harmful. There is a more general concern about the nature of \u201cmillimetre wave\u201d technology, which forms part of the 5G spectrum in some nations (although not, at present, the UK).</p> \n<p>There\u2019s a belief that the technology is untested, and that the subsequent rollout is in effect an experiment on the population at large. And then there\u2019s a generalised frustration at the fact that the whole thing feels like a <em>fait accompli</em>, presented to the public as an unstoppable force of nature, rather than a consultative process of negotiation.</p> \n<p>If there were a negotiation, sitting on the side of the opposition would be Martin Pall. A retired professor from Washington State University, <a href=\"https://www.mendeley.com/authors/7005344391/\">Pall\u2019s research interests</a> are practically an encyclopaedia of the medical counterculture, ranging from a novel take on the causes of chronic fatigue syndrome, tinnitus and heart failure to research on the risks of wifi, tanning salons and other emitters of electromagnetic fields.</p> \n<p>In a 90-page <a href=\"https://peaceinspace.blogs.com/files/5g-emf-hazards--dr-martin-l.-pall--eu-emf2018-6-11us3.pdf\">self-published document posted online</a> last May, Pall gave the rallying cry for the 5G opposition: \u201cPutting in tens of millions of 5G antennas without a single biological test of safety has got to be about the stupidest idea anyone has had in the history of the world,\u201d he wrote. That line has been widely quoted, everywhere <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/auo3hr/putting_in_tens_of_millions_of_5g_antennae/\">from the r/conspiracy subreddit</a> to the House of Commons, where <a href=\"https://www.theyworkforyou.com/whall/?id=2019-06-25a.294.0&amp;p=11661&amp;fbclid=IwAR0MsqEQ7WHokxGVU0H-5u8T6l5tDiIzRHLNDe94WauPg8uPUtwKoZ_Zj28\">Antoniazzi approvingly quoted</a> Pall to accuse the government of \u201csweeping the health concerns under the carpet\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe extremely inaccurate statements being made by certain MPs was disappointing,\u201d Jones said when I spoke to him after Antoniazzi\u2019s comments. \u201cI think you would expect better from people representing constituents. I would expect a higher standard of research to have been done.\u201d</p> \n<p>But the problem with calling for research is that it\u2019s very easy to research 5G\u2019s effects on health. Just Google \u201cis 5G bad for health\u201d and you\u2019ll find numerous articles confirming just that: \u201cWhy 5G cell towers are more dangerous \u2013 get the facts!\u201d, reads a headline on RadiationHealthRisks.com, on the first page of Google results. Just above that, an Eluxe Magazine article (\u201cFrightening frequencies: the dangers of 5G\u201d) presents a list of cherry-picked studies demonstrating various harms from various types of radio waves.</p> \n<p>But these fears are decades old. So why the specific panic about 5G? Everyone has a different answer. Scott Petty, Vodafone\u2019s chief technology officer, says that some of the misinformation stems from the US, where a particular form of 5G using a part of the radio spectrum known as millimetre wave or mmWave technology will be put into use.</p> \n<p>It hasn\u2019t been used in mobile phone networks before, largely because it\u2019s not particularly good at the job: as a high-frequency part of the spectrum, it\u2019s more easily blocked by things like trees or glass. When there\u2019s clear line of sight, it can carry more information than the parts of the spectrum now used for mobile phones, but not enough to make it worth the trade-off for Vodafone, Petty says.</p> \n<p>The use of mmWave has allowed some scary inferences to be drawn. The spectrum has previously been used for two other well-reported purposes: the body-scanners installed in airports over the last decade, and an experimental US weapon called the <a href=\"https://jnlwp.defense.gov/About/Frequently-Asked-Questions/Active-Denial-System-FAQs/\">Active Denial System</a>, which fires a high-powered beam at a target, creating a burning sensation.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s easy to see how that link can be spun into something fearful. But 5G is no more a weapon of war than a wifi router is a microwave oven \u2013 even though both those products use the same part of the spectrum, around the 2.4Ghz mark.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/21/5g-finally-launches-in-the-uk-but-is-it-really-worth-it\">5G finally launches in the UK \u2013 but is it really worth it?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The same flaws of mmWave that mean it\u2019s not being used in the UK have led to another line of concern: that in order to get around the problems, carriers will massively increase the number of masts they install. \u201cThat would be true if we only used mmWave,\u201d Petty says, \u201cbut no one is planning that. We will use approximately the same number as we already use for 2, 3 and 4G.\u201d</p> \n<p>And then there\u2019s more half-science. \u201cThe higher the frequency, the more dangerous the spectrum\u201d is, broadly, true: all ionising radiation lies at the extremely high frequencies. But between x-rays and mmWave lies quite a large part of the spectrum that people interact with all the time: visible light.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s easy for the British industry to dismiss concerns by pointing to mistakes about mmWave technology, but perhaps shortsighted, writes Peter Wingate-Saul, a chartered surveyor who has worked in the telecoms industry for more than 20 years. After all, \u201cyou probably will be using them sooner or later\u201d, so it\u2019s worth avoiding \u201cthe impression that there might be something suspect about them\u201d.</p> \n<p>EE\u2019s Jones has a bolder answer to why 5G misinformation is so widespread, citing a New York Times article that highlighted how popular scary stories about the technology had become on Russia Today. The paper <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/12/science/5g-phone-safety-health-russia.html\">noted that the American version of the channel</a> had run seven documentaries alleging 5G harms in 2019 alone, and argued that the move was part of an effort to hold the US back on rollout of the technology. Russia itself lags behind the pack but hopes to catch up.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is in and of itself a conspiracy theory, and yet there are points at which it appears quite credible,\u201d Jones says with a chuckle. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting take \u2013 that plays into the idea that it is more concerted than we have seen before.\u201d</p> \n<p>Then there\u2019s the technology effect. In recent years, a number of algorithm changes at Facebook have served to push users away from news and into private groups, where, as the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/a-privacy-focused-vision-for-social-networking/10156700570096634/\">wrote earlier this year</a>, they have \u201cthe freedom to be themselves and connect more naturally\u201d.</p> \n<p>But those groups frequently serve to amplify misinformation, by concentrating like-minded people together and excluding any potential corrective viewpoint. And so, if you search for 5G on Facebook, the suggested groups have a theme: \u201cHalt 5G in the South West\u201d, \u201c5G-MASS ACTION CAMPAIGN GROUP\u201d and \u201c5G - The Facts\u201d \u2013 illustrated with an image reading \u201c5G: Fried brains, anyone?\u201d</p> \n<p>Facebook has taken action against some kinds of medical misinformation on its site, acting to crack down on the more directly harmful spread of scaremongering over vaccines, but it is clear that the site\u2019s very structure supports the spread of these concerns.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe media landscape is now more suited to this kind of news,\u201d Jones says. \u201cThere is a growing scepticism of the mainstream media, there is the rise of the so-called \u201cindependents\u201d, and there is a lack of any real quality control. The viral nature of alarmist, extreme viewpoints is easier to catalyse than ever before. And the overall effect when there\u2019s a lack of trust from authority is that people will seek out other sources.\u201d</p> \n<p>But Wingate-Saul has a simpler proposition. The No 1 reason for objecting to base stations, he wrote in a presentation last month, is simply that \u201cwe were not even consulted\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf people are upset, they will perceive a thing as more dangerous \u2026 if people perceive a thing as dangerous, they will become upset,\u201d Wingate-Saul added. \u201cOnce people are upset, they become resistant to reason. Simply \u2018explaining the data\u2019 is not going to work. We are all immune to information we don\u2019t want to learn.\u201d</p> \n<p>So Wingate-Saul\u2019s advice to those seeking to avoid the fear is simpler. Engage with communities earlier, explain the technology and its constraints in simple non-technical terms, and \u201cpay close attention to aesthetic design and symmetry\u201d. If mobile phone masts are nicer, fewer people will be enraged by them, turn to the internet, and convince themselves they\u2019re dangerous.</p> \n<p>But it\u2019s probably too late for that to save the reputation of 5G. The rollout is progressing at full speed, and many more sites will be upgraded or installed over the coming months, creating more frustrated residents, and perpetuating the cycle further. Eventually, some will forget and move on, with just a nagging feeling that they ought to be concerned. Others will remain dedicated, until another spark ignites the movement again.</p> \n<p>Based on historical trends, we can expect to see 6G launched in the mid- to late 2020s, using a still higher part of the spectrum. And based on those same trends, we can expect opposition.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Tonia Antoniazzi stood up in the House of Commons to talk about the risks of 5G, she admitted that \u201cinitiating a conversation \u2026 has had members of my own team and family telling me that it is all made up.\u201d But the Labour MP was undeterred, securing a debate in parliament and the support of a handful of Labour and SNP colleagues to ask about the \u201cunintended consequences\u201d of the latest upgrade to the nation\u2019s mobile phone network. The government\u2019s response \u2013 that there was no evidence of any risk, and that it anticipated \u201cno negative effects on public health\u201d \u2013 was, Antoniazzi said, \u201cfar from reassuring\u201d. Junk science is a fact of life. Between hyperbolic reporting of careful studies, careful reporting of hyperbolic studies and \u201ccommon sense\u201d dismissal of any studies at all, it is getting harder and harder for non-experts to separate reasonable concerns from medical misinformation. So as Britain\u2019s carriers lined up to launch their 5G networks this summer, they were expecting some resistance. Fears over the health effects of mobile telephony are widespread, ranging from fairly limited concerns about potential long-term risks of living or growing up in close proximity to masts, to claims of full-blown \u201celectromagnetic sensitivity\u201d, which supposedly manifests as a plethora of symptoms from headaches to immunodeficiencies. But what greeted them wasn\u2019t just the same collection of alternative medicine proponents and anti-infrastructure nimbys who reliably oppose every new launch. \u201cWere we surprised by the existence of opposition? No,\u201d says EE\u2019s head of technology communications, Howard Jones. \u201cWere we surprised by the scale, and the organised nature of it? Yes \u2026 It\u2019s alarmist, very sensationalist and designed to scare.\u201d Jones is firm: there is absolutely no evidence that 5G, or any other part of the network, is dangerous. \u201cThe wavelengths that 5G uses and will use are all entirely safe and have been in research and testing for decades. It\u2019s a red herring to say it\u2019s a new technology and therefore hasn\u2019t been tested,\u201d he says. To fully debunk the health fears around 5G is impossible: there is no consistent set of claims being made, few explicit studies being cited, and a surfeit of scientific terminology being used in ways that obscure rather than illuminate. Not a single expert the Guardian spoke to believed there was any reliable evidence of harm from 5G or any other part of the publicly licensed broadcast spectrum. And the carriers are emphatic that, in the words of Three UK, \u201cfrom a health and safety perspective, 5G deployment is no different to any other mobile technology \u2026 no harmful levels of radiation are emitted.\u201d But there are themes that recur again and again. At the far end of the range is belief that the 5G rollout is a vast mind control experiment, a successor to the CIA\u2019s MKUltra experiments. There is the fear that 5G will result in a great increase in the number of masts, or the amount of energy sent over the radio spectrum, in a way that will prove harmful. There is a more general concern about the nature of \u201cmillimetre wave\u201d technology, which forms part of the 5G spectrum in some nations (although not, at present, the UK). There\u2019s a belief that the technology is untested, and that the subsequent rollout is in effect an experiment on the population at large. And then there\u2019s a generalised frustration at the fact that the whole thing feels like a fait accompli, presented to the public as an unstoppable force of nature, rather than a consultative process of negotiation. If there were a negotiation, sitting on the side of the opposition would be Martin Pall. A retired professor from Washington State University, Pall\u2019s research interests are practically an encyclopaedia of the medical counterculture, ranging from a novel take on the causes of chronic fatigue syndrome, tinnitus and heart failure to research on the risks of wifi, tanning salons and other emitters of electromagnetic fields. In a 90-page self-published document posted online last May, Pall gave the rallying cry for the 5G opposition: \u201cPutting in tens of millions of 5G antennas without a single biological test of safety has got to be about the stupidest idea anyone has had in the history of the world,\u201d he wrote. That line has been widely quoted, everywhere from the r/conspiracy subreddit to the House of Commons, where Antoniazzi approvingly quoted Pall to accuse the government of \u201csweeping the health concerns under the carpet\u201d. \u201cThe extremely inaccurate statements being made by certain MPs was disappointing,\u201d Jones said when I spoke to him after Antoniazzi\u2019s comments. \u201cI think you would expect better from people representing constituents. I would expect a higher standard of research to have been done.\u201d But the problem with calling for research is that it\u2019s very easy to research 5G\u2019s effects on health. Just Google \u201cis 5G bad for health\u201d and you\u2019ll find numerous articles confirming just that: \u201cWhy 5G cell towers are more dangerous \u2013 get the facts!\u201d, reads a headline on RadiationHealthRisks.com, on the first page of Google results. Just above that, an Eluxe Magazine article (\u201cFrightening frequencies: the dangers of 5G\u201d) presents a list of cherry-picked studies demonstrating various harms from various types of radio waves. But these fears are decades old. So why the specific panic about 5G? Everyone has a different answer. Scott Petty, Vodafone\u2019s chief technology officer, says that some of the misinformation stems from the US, where a particular form of 5G using a part of the radio spectrum known as millimetre wave or mmWave technology will be put into use. It hasn\u2019t been used in mobile phone networks before, largely because it\u2019s not particularly good at the job: as a high-frequency part of the spectrum, it\u2019s more easily blocked by things like trees or glass. When there\u2019s clear line of sight, it can carry more information than the parts of the spectrum now used for mobile phones, but not enough to make it worth the trade-off for Vodafone, Petty says. The use of mmWave has allowed some scary inferences to be drawn. The spectrum has previously been used for two other well-reported purposes: the body-scanners installed in airports over the last decade, and an experimental US weapon called the Active Denial System, which fires a high-powered beam at a target, creating a burning sensation. It\u2019s easy to see how that link can be spun into something fearful. But 5G is no more a weapon of war than a wifi router is a microwave oven \u2013 even though both those products use the same part of the spectrum, around the 2.4Ghz mark. The same flaws of mmWave that mean it\u2019s not being used in the UK have led to another line of concern: that in order to get around the problems, carriers will massively increase the number of masts they install. \u201cThat would be true if we only used mmWave,\u201d Petty says, \u201cbut no one is planning that. We will use approximately the same number as we already use for 2, 3 and 4G.\u201d And then there\u2019s more half-science. \u201cThe higher the frequency, the more dangerous the spectrum\u201d is, broadly, true: all ionising radiation lies at the extremely high frequencies. But between x-rays and mmWave lies quite a large part of the spectrum that people interact with all the time: visible light. It\u2019s easy for the British industry to dismiss concerns by pointing to mistakes about mmWave technology, but perhaps shortsighted, writes Peter Wingate-Saul, a chartered surveyor who has worked in the telecoms industry for more than 20 years. After all, \u201cyou probably will be using them sooner or later\u201d, so it\u2019s worth avoiding \u201cthe impression that there might be something suspect about them\u201d. EE\u2019s Jones has a bolder answer to why 5G misinformation is so widespread, citing a New York Times article that highlighted how popular scary stories about the technology had become on Russia Today. The paper noted that the American version of the channel had run seven documentaries alleging 5G harms in 2019 alone, and argued that the move was part of an effort to hold the US back on rollout of the technology. Russia itself lags behind the pack but hopes to catch up. \u201cIt is in and of itself a conspiracy theory, and yet there are points at which it appears quite credible,\u201d Jones says with a chuckle. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting take \u2013 that plays into the idea that it is more concerted than we have seen before.\u201d Then there\u2019s the technology effect. In recent years, a number of algorithm changes at Facebook have served to push users away from news and into private groups, where, as the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, wrote earlier this year, they have \u201cthe freedom to be themselves and connect more naturally\u201d. But those groups frequently serve to amplify misinformation, by concentrating like-minded people together and excluding any potential corrective viewpoint. And so, if you search for 5G on Facebook, the suggested groups have a theme: \u201cHalt 5G in the South West\u201d, \u201c5G-MASS ACTION CAMPAIGN GROUP\u201d and \u201c5G - The Facts\u201d \u2013 illustrated with an image reading \u201c5G: Fried brains, anyone?\u201d Facebook has taken action against some kinds of medical misinformation on its site, acting to crack down on the more directly harmful spread of scaremongering over vaccines, but it is clear that the site\u2019s very structure supports the spread of these concerns. \u201cThe media landscape is now more suited to this kind of news,\u201d Jones says. \u201cThere is a growing scepticism of the mainstream media, there is the rise of the so-called \u201cindependents\u201d, and there is a lack of any real quality control. The viral nature of alarmist, extreme viewpoints is easier to catalyse than ever before. And the overall effect when there\u2019s a lack of trust from authority is that people will seek out other sources.\u201d But Wingate-Saul has a simpler proposition. The No 1 reason for objecting to base stations, he wrote in a presentation last month, is simply that \u201cwe were not even consulted\u201d. \u201cIf people are upset, they will perceive a thing as more dangerous \u2026 if people perceive a thing as dangerous, they will become upset,\u201d Wingate-Saul added. \u201cOnce people are upset, they become resistant to reason. Simply \u2018explaining the data\u2019 is not going to work. We are all immune to information we don\u2019t want to learn.\u201d So Wingate-Saul\u2019s advice to those seeking to avoid the fear is simpler. Engage with communities earlier, explain the technology and its constraints in simple non-technical terms, and \u201cpay close attention to aesthetic design and symmetry\u201d. If mobile phone masts are nicer, fewer people will be enraged by them, turn to the internet, and convince themselves they\u2019re dangerous. But it\u2019s probably too late for that to save the reputation of 5G. The rollout is progressing at full speed, and many more sites will be upgraded or installed over the coming months, creating more frustrated residents, and perpetuating the cycle further. Eventually, some will forget and move on, with just a nagging feeling that they ought to be concerned. Others will remain dedicated, until another spark ignites the movement again. Based on historical trends, we can expect to see 6G launched in the mid- to late 2020s, using a still higher part of the spectrum. And based on those same trends, we can expect opposition.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cI\u2019ve come into contact with this idea of banter, which is really dressing up racism, sexism and homophobia. It\u2019s important for people in the sector to have the confidence to call out these things regardless of the impact, even if it means they might be ostracised at work.\u201d The woman who made this comment at the Institute for Fundraising\u2019s annual conference doesn\u2019t work in banking or sports. She works for a charity. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to people who feel that if they were to speak out they\u2019d be deemed as aggressive, or a problem, or not in line with their charity\u2019s aims,\u201d she says. \u201cI find it upsetting.\u201d Sexual harassment, racism and homophobia are as rife in the voluntary sector as anywhere else, according to charity activist Lucy Caldicott, who chaired the conference session on power and privilege. \u201cWe live in difficult, fractious times. Power is increasingly being focused in the hands of a few, while minorities have to scramble against one another,\u201d she says. \u201cYou might ask what\u2019s this got to do with fundraising. But the same issues of racism and sexual abuse that permeate the rest of society are here, too. We\u2019ve got to front up to that and work on it.\u201d Caldicott, a member of the Institute of Fundraising\u2019s advisory panel on diversity and inclusion, has been alarmed by the evidence she discovered when talking to fundraisers as part of the institute\u2019s research to inform its new diversity strategy. \u201cPeople were sharing their stories of sexual abuse, of racist abuse, of LGBT exclusion \u2013 and we think we\u2019re the good guys,\u201d she says. Sufina Ahmad, chair of the institute\u2019s equality panel, said the \u201csuccinct but ambitious\u201d plans would help make UK fundraising more equal, and address inequalities in the profession. This includes the underrepresentation of BME and disabled fundraisers, and LGBT fundraisers not always able to be open in the workplace. And while two-thirds of all charity and voluntary sector staff are women, less than a third of the chief executives at the UK\u2019s top 50 charities are women. Caldicott has direct experience of the issues. She describes trying to build professional relationships as a fundraiser with wealthy older men, who would ask if she was married. \u201cI had to assess whether to disclose that my partner is female and that it was she who put the wedding ring on my finger at our civil partnership,\u201d she says. The entire charity, voluntary and aid sector has been rocked over the past few years by scandals over sexual abuse, highlighted \u2013 but by no means confined to \u2013 Oxfam\u2019s sexual exploitation scandal in Haiti. The Charity Commission\u2019s recent damning report on the scandal found abuse far beyond Haiti and concluded the issues were endemic. But these issues aren\u2019t unique to Save the Children or Oxfam, wrote NGO worker and commentator Deborah Doane: \u201cSexual abuse is about money and power, and these are the key pillars on which the aid system has been built.\u201d Former international aid worker and Oxford councillor Shaista Aziz, one of the panellists at the session, agrees. She welcomes the conversations sparked by the #MeToo movement and by #AidToo, launched in 2017 to highlight sexual violence in the global aid sector. \u201cBut it\u2019s important to acknowledge who\u2019s missing from that conversation,\u201d Aziz points out. \u201cBlack women, women of colour from the southern hemisphere, are often unable or unwilling to disclose their experiences because they are easily identifiable.\u201d Aziz says her 15 years\u2019 work in international aid showed a clear separation between aid workers and the people they work with. \u201cVery rarely are the aid workers from the same background as the people they are working with,\u201d she comments. \u201cIt gives you a good idea of what privilege is, what power is, when people are automatically separated based on their race, and the colour of their passport \u2013 whether they come from so-called third world or developing countries.\u201d Aziz also highlights the personal toll of speaking up. \u201cI can\u2019t keep describing what\u2019s happened to me because it\u2019s just too exhausting,\u201d she says. Several session participants shared fears that speaking up could impact their career, and expressed frustration over the pace of change. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for people in the sector to have the confidence to call these things out,\u201d said one woman at the session. \u201cIt\u2019s great that these conversations are happening, and the speed with which they are happening \u2013 but why are they only happening now?\u201d",

It is a shame perhaps that he does not take us match by match through a typical Cardus season during his golden years between the wars, or compare more forensically his reports with those of other cricket journalists of the time; there is also the odd slip (MacLaren\u2019s \u201clast hurrah\u201d was not at Eastbourne but the following year at Wellington, as he took a majestic 200 not out off the New Zealand attack; Chamberlain returned with his infamous piece of paper not from Berchtesgaden but from Munich).

Then the breakdown in the spring of 1919, the inspired decision at the start of that summer\u2019s cricket season to give him some fresh air by sending him to Old Trafford to report on Lancashire\u2019s first peacetime match.

      "body": "<p>Bridget Riley should be illegal. After a few minutes in her<a href=\"https://www.nationalgalleries.org/exhibition/bridget-riley\"> sensational retrospective at the Scottish National Gallery</a> my perceptions were all over the place. Paintings were rocking and rolling through grand white salons, moving in waves, sending hills and troughs from their flat surfaces into three-dimensional space. One Riley makes you larger, one makes you small, and the rest of the Edinburgh art festival doesn\u2019t do anything at all.</p> <p>Riley is 88 but her art has never felt younger than it does in this scintillating exhibition. It\u2019s the display her art has long deserved \u2013 one that does justice to her experimental spirit and dazzling intelligence over six decades, without losing sight of the 1960s utopianism that is her enduring legacy. It refuses to plod along in chronological order. Instead, it starts with a brilliant spin through her fascination with the dappled optical art of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2010/apr/14/george-seurat-bathers-at-asnieres-art\">Georges Seurat</a>. In 1960 she painted Pink Landscape, a rural vista that bursts into a vibrating light show of separated spots of blue, pink and gold. No sooner have your eyes acclimatised to this unreal pointillism that they\u2019re being taken for a ride by the black and white visual trickery of 1961\u2019s Movement in Squares, whose mind-boggling array of narrowing rectangles, like a phantasmagorical chess board, sucks you into what feels like a fold in the fabric of reality.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7264c565fbd0016dc65ba460fa4e253a2a373db0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7264c565fbd0016dc65ba460fa4e253a2a373db0/0_0_900_909/495.jpg\" alt=\"Pink Landscape, 1960, by Bridget Riley.\" width=\"495\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pink Landscape, 1960, by Bridget Riley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bridget Riley 2019</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From there it\u2019s a rollercoaster of the mind \u2013 and why not? This is a festival. Let\u2019s go wild. Riley\u2019s black and white classics of the early 1960s melt into the stone-free walls of colour she painted later in the decade. As the pinks and greens remix in your head there\u2019s a staggering room full of drawings that reveals the intricate calculations behind her revolutionary effects.</p> <p>This is art that invades your very being. In 1976, when she painted Clepsydra, a warping wavelength of red, green and purple, Riley was still on her trip when the rest of the world had come down. That, of course, is because her art owes nothing to narcotics. Its joy comes from a pure embrace of visual experience. The paradox of this exhibition is that while you enjoy the sheer buzz coming off the walls you are never less than daunted by the discipline of this artist. Riley\u2019s big and open paintings have the austerity of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jun/02/mondrian-tortured-quest-for-spiritual-salvation-gemeentemuseum-hague\">Mondrian</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2013/may/16/barnett-newman-sublime-bargain-price\">Barnett Newman</a>. Any effect has to be created by her spare and simple means of abstract line and colour. And within those self-set rules she creates visions of Xanadu.</p> <p>It\u2019s a cold shock to step out of Riley\u2019s visionary dreamland into the anything but utopian world of 2019. In a side street in Edinburgh\u2019s Old Town, New Yorker <strong>Alfredo Jaar</strong> has put up a neon sign that simply quotes Samuel Beckett: \u201cI can\u2019t go on, I\u2019ll go on.\u201d This shrug of an artwork is depressing precisely because we know what he means. But is that all art can do \u2013 moan under the weight of it all?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"118a4b45c72a09c955a7b3909cfd8d19878b3fd5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/118a4b45c72a09c955a7b3909cfd8d19878b3fd5/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oomph \u2026 a tapestry from \u2018typical Essex woman\u2019 Julie Cope\u2019s Grand Tour by Grayson Perry, at Dovecot Studios.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oomph \u2026 a tapestry from \u2018typical Essex woman\u2019 Julie Cope\u2019s Grand Tour by Grayson Perry, at Dovecot Studios.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At least <strong>Grayson Perry</strong> puts some oomph into his satire. Dovecot Studios is showing a set of brightly coloured tapestries in which he tells the story of Julie Cope, a child of modern Britain, whose parents and their friends in 1970s Basildon are portrayed in rollicking Bruegel-like tableaus of kitsch facial hair and kipper ties. Everyone\u2019s got the same expression of manic desperation.</p> <p>Perry and Riley make a fascinating contrast. They both speed up Edinburgh\u2019s sobriety with chromatic quaaludes. However, where Riley committed herself in 1960 to an art of sublime abstraction, Perry tells tales and makes gags about \u2013 as he says of his character Cope \u2013 \u201caverage\u201d lives. That\u2019s why he\u2019s the one you know from TV. But in the end it\u2019s like going to a play that\u2019s not quite funny enough. You realise you are laughing for no reason.</p> <p>There\u2019s even less reason to climb Calton Hill, a lofty crag on which Edinburgh\u2019s old astronomical observatory hangs, for the art of <strong><a href=\"https://www.collective-edinburgh.art/programme/james-richards\">James Richards</a></strong>. It\u2019s a great idea to use this Acropolis of the north as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/nov/21/edinburgh-collective-art-gallery-city-observatory-calton-hill\">new home of art gallery Collective</a>, but it needs some good art, and Richards does not provide it. His sonic installation inside a circular domed chamber resolutely refuses to mean anything, although as hi-fi it\u2019s impressive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0dd3f05d5b9ad740db69366ced47c828ec4a6129\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0dd3f05d5b9ad740db69366ced47c828ec4a6129/0_0_5702_3842/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hong Kong artist Samson Young and his Real Music installation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"674\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grunts, taps and breaths \u2026 Hong Kong artist Samson Young and his Real Music installation at Talbot Rice Gallery.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s better sound art to be had at the <a href=\"https://www.trg.ed.ac.uk/\">Talbot Rice Gallery,</a> where Hong Kong composer and artist <strong>Samson Young</strong> shows a film of Cologne\u2019s Flora Symphony Orchestra playing Tchaikovsky\u2019s Fifth. But instead of its lush cascades of emotion you hear grunts, taps and breaths from wart-like objects on the carpeted floor. Young has edited out the music, so that we hear instead the physical actions of the players \u2013 the quiet underlay of noise as they put their lips to wind instruments or pick up violins. The fascinating thing is that you can still make sense of the performance.</p> <p>Young\u2019s art has a politics that\u2019s more focused than Jaar\u2019s miserable sign or Perry\u2019s scattergun hostility. A sequence of drawings follow a red line that marks the paths by which Hong Kong democracy protesters were recently dispersed. His work feels more urgent than <strong>Nathan Coley</strong>\u2019s inane text pieces installed in <a href=\"https://edinburghartfestival.com/whats-on/detail/commissions-programme-nathan-coley\">Parliament Hall</a>. And although <strong>David Batchelor</strong>\u2019s found-colour art at the <a href=\"https://www.inglebygallery.com/exhibitions/7132-david-batchelor-my-own-private-bauhaus/overview/\">Ingleby Gallery</a> is a witty enough game \u2013 his sculptures of paint-can lids with the contents stuck to them literally illustrate Frank Stella\u2019s demand for paint to look as good as it did in the can \u2013 his irony seems lacking in energy with those Riley ringing in your head.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"37e4305588402218574d205a71498ff63f9f5a34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37e4305588402218574d205a71498ff63f9f5a34/0_0_2636_3500/753.jpg\" alt=\"Bouteille et Verre sur un Table, 1912, by Pablo Picasso.\" width=\"753\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Victoriana \u2026 Bouteille et Verre sur un Table, 1912, by Pablo Picasso.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Succession Picasso/DACS, London 2018</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Batchelor is a kind of collagist, a gatherer of lovely fragments.

Ever seen Monty Python\u2019s Terry Gilliam in the same exhibition as Picasso? Maybe you have \u2013 but how about exhibiting the Baroque artist Pietro da Cortona with Jamie Reid\u2019s Never Mind the Bollocks? Aha, I can hear the curator say, you didn\u2019t see that one coming. This exhibition is a mad collage of collages. It even includes an \u201cartwork\u201d by Charles Dickens. In about 1860 he and his friend William Macready plastered a folding screen with cut-out reproductions of art.</p> <p>In other words, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/pablo-picasso\">Picasso</a> stuck a piece of newspaper to his 1912 still life Bottle and Glass on a Table, cutting and pasting it to form the body of the bottle \u2013 with a booze advert in the paper adding to the representational wit \u2013 he and his fellow cubist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2005/may/07/art1\">Georges Braque</a> were not \u201cinventing\u201d collage, as histories of modern art have it. They were just doing what Victorians had done before them. No wonder modern collage has so often feasted on Victoriana. Max Ernst\u2019s original cut-ups for his visual novels and Paul Eluard\u2019s picture of an elephant on the rampage in a Paris cafe go superbly well with the archaic early stuff here because these surrealist masterpieces were made by cannibalising old 19th century publications. That archaism survives in Peter Blake\u2019s 1962 masterpiece <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/blake-the-toy-shop-t01175\">The Toy Shop</a>, a pasted together treasury of childhood memories.</p> <p>Cut and Paste is huge fun, but I don\u2019t buy its thesis. That is because what matters is the idea that pasting paper can be art. To call every Victorian paper toy a collage is like saying anyone who used a snow shovel before <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prelude_to_a_Broken_Arm\">Duchamp nominated one as a readymade</a>, invented the readymade.</p> <p>Still, nostalgia is seductive. And out of old images might come a bit of the utopianism that glows in Riley\u2019s art. Glasgow dreamer Jim Lambie\u2019s Sticky Fingers is a psychedelic invocation of demon forces. He\u2019s collaged an intoxicating array of flowers from old paintings over a black and white photo. From out of the flowers peep Mick Jagger\u2019s feminine eyes. Lambie has been poking about in Riley\u2019s cabinet of colours, and he proves beauty can still mess with your head.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://edinburghartfestival.com/\">Various venues throughout Edinburgh until 25 August</a>.</p>",

For those who simply cannot get enough of superheroes, it puts a wicked spin on some now very familiar archetypes: the fierce warrior queen, the lickety-split speedster, the flag-draped mega-god walking among us. But if you are sick to the back teeth of billowing capes, The Boys also offers a sly corrective to our current era of blind hero worship by aiming some nasty kicks at their softest parts. It is gleeful, violent and blackly comic, a raucous rocket full of Kryptonite.</p> <p>The Boys takes place in a world where the so-called \u2018super-abled\u2019 are both real and omnipresent, dominating culture and commerce in a way that seems inevitable.

      "bodyText": "Superheroes are big business, literally, in Amazon\u2019s fantastical new comedy. The timing seems apt \u2013 The Boys touches down just as Avengers: Endgame has nudged past Avatar to become the most successful film of all time. For those who simply cannot get enough of superheroes, it puts a wicked spin on some now very familiar archetypes: the fierce warrior queen, the lickety-split speedster, the flag-draped mega-god walking among us. But if you are sick to the back teeth of billowing capes, The Boys also offers a sly corrective to our current era of blind hero worship by aiming some nasty kicks at their softest parts. It is gleeful, violent and blackly comic, a raucous rocket full of Kryptonite. The Boys takes place in a world where the so-called \u2018super-abled\u2019 are both real and omnipresent, dominating culture and commerce in a way that seems inevitable. The brightest and best are the Seven, a shiny supergroup represented by the blandly ominous Vought corporation and directed by calculating powerbroker Madelyn (Elisabeth Shue). These costumed paragons have been commercialised to an extent that even the Marvel merchandising machine might find a little distasteful. Between chat show appearances and energy-drink endorsements, the occasional bit of evil-doing is photogenically foiled, although Vought is also eyeing up some lucrative government defence contracts.

This memoir of the love affair that gave rise to the songs So Long, Marianne and Bird on a Wire is a tender, illuminating film, even if Ihlen\u2019s life turned out relatively uneventful.</p> <h2>The Chambermaid (15)</h2> <p><em>(Lila Avil\u00e9s, 2018, Mex) 102 mins</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7qeFD624U4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/D7qeFD624U4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>A counterpoint to the nostalgic fix of Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s Roma, this is another Mexican-made investigation of the role of the servant picking her way through a moneyed milieu. Gabriela Cartol gives a superbly low-key performance as the hotel worker trying to keep her head above water, while being ignored by the wealthy people she services.</p> <h2>The Great Hack (No cert)</h2> <p><em>(Karim Amer, Jehane Noujaim, 2019, US) 113 mins</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX8GxLP1FHo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iX8GxLP1FHo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The Observer\u2019s Carole Cadwalladr is the star turn in this doc about the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the ramifications of which we are still living with in the form of Brexit and the Trump presidency. This film does a fine job in explaining what the hell happened: how the data company extracted masses of information from millions of unwitting Facebook users, then used it for political propaganda. Cutting-edge film-making.</p> <h2>Varda By Agn\u00e8s (15)</h2> <p><em>(Agn\u00e8s Varda, 2019, Fra) 115 mins</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xOe2yRr6E8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4xOe2yRr6E8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Varda died earlier this year aged 90, and this charming lecture-cum-documentary is an excellent primer for anyone looking to understand her unique presence. As a film-maker, her achievements are clear, but it\u2019s her infectious enthusiasm and creativity that comes across most strongly here; a fine testament to a director whose latter-day popularity was much deserved.</p> <h2>The Lion King (PG)</h2> <p><em>(Jon Favreau, 2019, US) 118 mins</em></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TavVZMewpY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7TavVZMewpY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Despite some iffy reviews, the latest Disney has already become a bona-fide cultural phenomenon: as much for the Beyonc\u00e9-curated soundtrack as the photorealistic visuals. But there is something uninspired about this heavily CGI-ed rendering of a beautifully simple animated film.

Performances come from jazz quintet Ezra Collective, multigenre icon Neneh Cherry and Henry Wu, who will also be performing under his real name, Kamaal Williams. <br><em><a href=\"https://dice.fm/event/rmypr-naked-city-festival-27th-jul-beckenham-place-park-tickets\">Beckenham Place Park, Saturday 28 July</a></em></p> <h2>Lucinda Williams</h2> <p>Blighted by label woes, creative differences and even a tornado that threatened to destroy the tapes, Williams\u2019s lauded 1998 album Car Wheels on a Gravel Road almost didn\u2019t see the light of day. Here it\u2019s celebrated as part of a 20-year anniversary tour bringing her dusty Americana to the UK. <br><em>London, Saturday 27; Bristol, Sunday 28; Brighton, Monday 29 July; Holmfirth, <a href=\"https://www.lucindawilliams.com/tour\">Thursday 1; Birmingham, Friday 2; touring to 4 August</a></em></p> <h2>Wilderness</h2> <p>Sure, Wilderness festival offers up music, including Robyn\u2019s heart-busting electro-pop, Tom Odell\u2019s \u201cquite nice\u201d piano bothering and Groove Armada\u2019s Ford Mondeo dance, but the real star is its wellbeing offerings. Why not have an existential crisis at the Why Happiness Isn\u2019t the Answer workshop? Or test your core during Paddleboard Yoga? Anyone? <br><em><a href=\"https://www.wildernessfestival.com/\">Cornbury Park, nr Chipping Norton, Thursday 1 to 4 August</a></em><br></p> <h2>Father John Misty</h2> <p>There was a point when Father John Misty, AKA Josh Tillman, was everywhere, be it \u201cbeefing\u201d with Ryan Adams, writing songs with Lady Gaga or goading music news outlets with every Twitter bon mot. He seems to be focusing on the music more of late, with last year\u2019s God\u2019s Favorite Customer showcasing a more vulnerable, empathic, but no less egomaniacal troubadour. Expect a lot of between-song chat. <br><em><a href=\"http://fatherjohnmisty.com/#tour\">Kelvingrove Park, Glasgow, Friday 2 August</a></em></p> <p><em>MC</em></p> <h2>Prom 16: Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo</h2> <p>Africa\u2019s 18th- and 19th-century slave-trade diaspora to the US, Brazil and Cuba oppressed millions and it also transformed the way the world sang, danced, heard music and played it. For this late-night Proms concert, the west African vocalist Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo celebrates Africa\u2019s influence on her personal inspiration, the late Cuban salsa diva Celia Cruz. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.royalalberthall.com/tickets/proms/bbc-proms-2019/prom-16-angelique-kidjo/\">Royal Albert Hall, SW7, Tuesday 30 July</a></em></p> <p><em>JF</em></p> <h2><strong>Three of the best ... classical concerts</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6811b1f9c0d5a02c494101e85372a897be754e0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6811b1f9c0d5a02c494101e85372a897be754e0b/169_49_1682_1009/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grimeborn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grimeborn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Idil Sukan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Grimeborn</h2> <p>Amid the mainstream flim-flam of the summer\u2019s country-house opera, east London\u2019s alternative offers very different and much more unpredictable music theatre. As usual, the menu includes reworked and downsized repertory works \u2013 La Traviata, Das Rheingold, Die Fledermaus, Count Ory \u2013 alongside brand new operas, including Matt Geer\u2019s Sane and Sound and Noah Mosley\u2019s Aurora. There is also a double bill pairing Schoenberg\u2019s Pierrot Lunaire with Gillian Whitehead\u2019s Hotspur, and a rare opportunity to catch Amy Beach\u2019s chamber opera Cabildo. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.arcolatheatre.com/grimeborn/\">Arcola Theatre, E8 Monday 29 July to 7 September</a></em></p> <h2>Proms at \u2026 Battersea Arts Centre</h2> <p>Supplementing the main Albert Hall orchestral concerts, Proms at \u2026 takes in a series of alternative venues around London. Programme details for the visit to the newly reopened Battersea Arts Centre are still vague, but the performer-composers appearing include cellist Oliver Coates, electro-folkies Crewdson &amp; Cevanne and the unclassifiable Jennifer Walshe. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/events/e6hj6q\">Battersea Arts Centre, SW11, Saturday 27 July</a></em></p> <h2>LA Phil at Tynecastle</h2> <p>The music strand of the Edinburgh international festival is traditionally launched with a big event in the Usher Hall. This year, though, it kicks off at the home of Heart of Midlothian FC, with an outdoor concert by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and its conductor, Gustavo Dudamel. It is the first of their three appearances this year; later concerts include Mahler\u2019s Resurrection Symphony and John Adams\u2019s new piano concerto, but they begin with an evening of Hollywood scores by Korngold, Herrmann, Waxman and John Williams. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.eif.co.uk/whats-on/2019/laphil-tynecastle\">Tynecastle Park, Edinburgh, Friday 2 August</a></em></p> <p><em>AC</em></p> <h2><strong>Five of the best ... exhibitions</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"740c5adef12d2fd57207cb650f73b4d9f68bf12d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/740c5adef12d2fd57207cb650f73b4d9f68bf12d/0_0_1074_891/1000.jpg\" alt=\"L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"830\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 the Estate of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>David Batchelor</h2> <p>Found colour fascinates this Dundee-born flaneur of everyday beauty. Batchelor collects ordinary objects \u2013 a trolley, a box, a sign \u2013 that happen to use bright, distinctive colours. He arranges these neglected wonders to create sculpture that combines a formal delight in chromatic pattern with a raw sense of real life. A radiant artist. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.inglebygallery.com/exhibitions/7132-david-batchelor-my-own-private-bauhaus/overview/\">Ingleby Gallery, Edinburgh to 28 September</a></em></p> <h2>Cindy Sherman</h2> <p>The early self-portraits exhibited here by the renowned American artist of masquerade see her pose as a Hitchcockian character in black-and-white photographs that lovingly recreate the atmosphere of film noir. Sherman has gone on to remake herself in endless metamorphoses yet has rarely matched the poetry of these first works. <br><em><a href=\"http://www.stills.org/exhibition/current-exhibition/cindy-sherman-early-works-1975-80\">Stills Gallery, Edinburgh, to 6 October</a></em></p> <h2>Chihuly</h2> <p>The eye-popping glassworks of this extravagant sculptor use lurid colour and impossibly spun tendrils and tentacles to mirror the complexity of nature. It is dazzling to see such scale and intricacy in the most delicate of materials.

His artistic brilliance let him think in a unique way: for instance, the anatomical illustrations here are both beautiful and a milestone in knowledge.

If you are struggling to make a choice (there are roughly a million shows this year), the Traverse Theatre is always strong. It is staging five world premieres and has new and recent work from a host of brilliant playwrights, including Stef Smith, David Edgar, Cora Bissett and Kieran Hurley. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.edfringe.com/\">Various venues Sat to 25 August</a></em></p> <h2>Kiss Me Kate</h2> <p>Director Paul Hart has proved himself to be such a talent, and particularly good at sparky and modern-feeling musicals, so hopes are high for this. Cole Porter\u2019s witty, jazz-infused riff on The Taming of the Shrew features finger-clicking hits such as Too Darn Hot. Rebecca Trehearn and David Ricardo-Pearce lead the cast. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.watermill.org.uk/\">West Berkshire Playhouse: The Watermill, Newbury, to 21 September</a></em></p> <h2>The View UpStairs</h2> <p>This new musical draws on the 1973 arson attack on a gay bar in New Orleans, one of the most devastating attacks on the LGBT community. The story focuses on Wes, an aspiring fashion designer who buys an abandoned building in New Orleans and unearths its harrowing history. Book, music and lyrics are written by Max Vernon and this European premiere will star Tyrone Huntley (pictured), who dazzled as Judas in Jesus Christ Superstar. <br><em><a href=\"https://sohotheatre.com/shows/the-view-upstairs/\">Soho Theatre, W1, to 24 August</a></em></p> <h2>Mr Gum and the Dancing Bear: The Musical</h2> <p>The summer holidays have arrived, which means a spate of family-friendly openings. Amy Hodge\u2019s production is for ages seven-plus and is based on Andy Stanton\u2019s barmy book about a big friendly bear, some very brave kids and mean old Mr Gum. The show includes dancing and puppetry and the music is written by Jim Fortune, whose score for the National\u2019s Pericles had such heart and heat. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/mr-gum-and-the-dancing-bear\">National Theatre: Dorfman, SE1, to 31 August</a></em></p> <h2>There Is a Light That Never Goes Out</h2> <p>Talented theatre-makers James Yeatman and Lauren Mooney are behind Kandinsky\u2019s devised show, which draws on local history and incorporates letters, handbills and articles from the time. The drama, set in the 1800s, is about the luddite rebellion \u2013 an attempt by textile workers to challenge the rise of machinery and agitate for rights.

      "bodyText": "Five of the best \u2026 films Marianne &amp; Leonard: Words of Love (12A) (Nick Broomfield, 2019, US) 102 mins Veteran documentarist Broomfield has a walk-on role in this film about Marianne Ihlen and the relationship she had with singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen; he met her as a young wannabe film-maker in the early 70s. This memoir of the love affair that gave rise to the songs So Long, Marianne and Bird on a Wire is a tender, illuminating film, even if Ihlen\u2019s life turned out relatively uneventful. The Chambermaid (15) (Lila Avil\u00e9s, 2018, Mex) 102 mins A counterpoint to the nostalgic fix of Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s Roma, this is another Mexican-made investigation of the role of the servant picking her way through a moneyed milieu. Gabriela Cartol gives a superbly low-key performance as the hotel worker trying to keep her head above water, while being ignored by the wealthy people she services. The Great Hack (No cert) (Karim Amer, Jehane Noujaim, 2019, US) 113 mins The Observer\u2019s Carole Cadwalladr is the star turn in this doc about the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the ramifications of which we are still living with in the form of Brexit and the Trump presidency. This film does a fine job in explaining what the hell happened: how the data company extracted masses of information from millions of unwitting Facebook users, then used it for political propaganda. Cutting-edge film-making. Varda By Agn\u00e8s (15) (Agn\u00e8s Varda, 2019, Fra) 115 mins Varda died earlier this year aged 90, and this charming lecture-cum-documentary is an excellent primer for anyone looking to understand her unique presence. As a film-maker, her achievements are clear, but it\u2019s her infectious enthusiasm and creativity that comes across most strongly here; a fine testament to a director whose latter-day popularity was much deserved. The Lion King (PG) (Jon Favreau, 2019, US) 118 mins Despite some iffy reviews, the latest Disney has already become a bona-fide cultural phenomenon: as much for the Beyonc\u00e9-curated soundtrack as the photorealistic visuals. But there is something uninspired about this heavily CGI-ed rendering of a beautifully simple animated film. A possibly unnecessary remake. AP Five of the best ... rock &amp; pop Naked City festival Founded by brothers Danny and Kieran Clancy, AKA promoters Krankbrother, this new festival showcases the best in jazz, soul and dance, all in the lush environs of a former golf course in London\u2019s south-east suburbs. Performances come from jazz quintet Ezra Collective, multigenre icon Neneh Cherry and Henry Wu, who will also be performing under his real name, Kamaal Williams. Beckenham Place Park, Saturday 28 July Lucinda Williams Blighted by label woes, creative differences and even a tornado that threatened to destroy the tapes, Williams\u2019s lauded 1998 album Car Wheels on a Gravel Road almost didn\u2019t see the light of day. Here it\u2019s celebrated as part of a 20-year anniversary tour bringing her dusty Americana to the UK. London, Saturday 27; Bristol, Sunday 28; Brighton, Monday 29 July; Holmfirth, Thursday 1; Birmingham, Friday 2; touring to 4 August Wilderness Sure, Wilderness festival offers up music, including Robyn\u2019s heart-busting electro-pop, Tom Odell\u2019s \u201cquite nice\u201d piano bothering and Groove Armada\u2019s Ford Mondeo dance, but the real star is its wellbeing offerings. Why not have an existential crisis at the Why Happiness Isn\u2019t the Answer workshop? Or test your core during Paddleboard Yoga? Anyone? Cornbury Park, nr Chipping Norton, Thursday 1 to 4 August Father John Misty There was a point when Father John Misty, AKA Josh Tillman, was everywhere, be it \u201cbeefing\u201d with Ryan Adams, writing songs with Lady Gaga or goading music news outlets with every Twitter bon mot. He seems to be focusing on the music more of late, with last year\u2019s God\u2019s Favorite Customer showcasing a more vulnerable, empathic, but no less egomaniacal troubadour. Expect a lot of between-song chat. Kelvingrove Park, Glasgow, Friday 2 August MC Prom 16: Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo Africa\u2019s 18th- and 19th-century slave-trade diaspora to the US, Brazil and Cuba oppressed millions and it also transformed the way the world sang, danced, heard music and played it. For this late-night Proms concert, the west African vocalist Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo celebrates Africa\u2019s influence on her personal inspiration, the late Cuban salsa diva Celia Cruz. Royal Albert Hall, SW7, Tuesday 30 July JF Three of the best ... classical concerts Grimeborn Amid the mainstream flim-flam of the summer\u2019s country-house opera, east London\u2019s alternative offers very different and much more unpredictable music theatre. As usual, the menu includes reworked and downsized repertory works \u2013 La Traviata, Das Rheingold, Die Fledermaus, Count Ory \u2013 alongside brand new operas, including Matt Geer\u2019s Sane and Sound and Noah Mosley\u2019s Aurora. There is also a double bill pairing Schoenberg\u2019s Pierrot Lunaire with Gillian Whitehead\u2019s Hotspur, and a rare opportunity to catch Amy Beach\u2019s chamber opera Cabildo. Arcola Theatre, E8 Monday 29 July to 7 September Proms at \u2026 Battersea Arts Centre Supplementing the main Albert Hall orchestral concerts, Proms at \u2026 takes in a series of alternative venues around London. Programme details for the visit to the newly reopened Battersea Arts Centre are still vague, but the performer-composers appearing include cellist Oliver Coates, electro-folkies Crewdson &amp; Cevanne and the unclassifiable Jennifer Walshe. Battersea Arts Centre, SW11, Saturday 27 July LA Phil at Tynecastle The music strand of the Edinburgh international festival is traditionally launched with a big event in the Usher Hall. This year, though, it kicks off at the home of Heart of Midlothian FC, with an outdoor concert by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and its conductor, Gustavo Dudamel. It is the first of their three appearances this year; later concerts include Mahler\u2019s Resurrection Symphony and John Adams\u2019s new piano concerto, but they begin with an evening of Hollywood scores by Korngold, Herrmann, Waxman and John Williams. Tynecastle Park, Edinburgh, Friday 2 August AC Five of the best ... exhibitions David Batchelor Found colour fascinates this Dundee-born flaneur of everyday beauty. Batchelor collects ordinary objects \u2013 a trolley, a box, a sign \u2013 that happen to use bright, distinctive colours. He arranges these neglected wonders to create sculpture that combines a formal delight in chromatic pattern with a raw sense of real life. A radiant artist. Ingleby Gallery, Edinburgh to 28 September Cindy Sherman The early self-portraits exhibited here by the renowned American artist of masquerade see her pose as a Hitchcockian character in black-and-white photographs that lovingly recreate the atmosphere of film noir. Sherman has gone on to remake herself in endless metamorphoses yet has rarely matched the poetry of these first works. Stills Gallery, Edinburgh, to 6 October Chihuly The eye-popping glassworks of this extravagant sculptor use lurid colour and impossibly spun tendrils and tentacles to mirror the complexity of nature. It is dazzling to see such scale and intricacy in the most delicate of materials. Dale Chihuly\u2019s glass wonders make fine summer decorations for Kew, whose glasshouses full of palms and waterlilies are themselves a stupefying artistic joy. Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, Richmond, to 27 October Leonardo da Vinci The drawings of the scientist, inventor, engineer, architect, theatre designer and \u2013 oh yes \u2013 painter, who died 500 years ago, are a dazzling window on his mind. His artistic brilliance let him think in a unique way: for instance, the anatomical illustrations here are both beautiful and a milestone in knowledge. From the foetus in the womb to sketches of the end of the world, this is a sublime encounter with genius. The Queen\u2019s Gallery, Buckingham Palace, SW1, to 13 October L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy Moholy-Nagy was something of a Leonardo himself, experimenting with light and shadow to create an art for the machine age. In 1930, he made a device that whirrs around with lights going on and off to generate a spectacular shadow ballet. The same dramatic feel for contrasting light gives his photographs a stark strength. He has an eye for sports and spaces that lets him focus on the human machine.

As he sings on the title track: \u201cTell \u2019em Africa we done dying.\u201d The more pointed lines are saved for his fellow Nigerians: his musings on post-colonialism on Another Story are in pidgin English, a neat bit of cultural reclamation. That unfamiliarity, and his sensual, even rather muted music, may make it hard for him to cut through the noise of western pop culture \u2013 but this makes for a classy summer soundtrack.",

Training has been competitive.</p> <p>\u201cWe were in Colorado Springs for two weeks,\u201d says Scully, down the phone, \u201cand for the last two weeks we\u2019ve been here in Glendale. And so we\u2019ve had a pretty good block together. A lot of high-intensity fitness work, a lot of foundational work, building pieces we are going to need.\u201d</p> <p>Canada have <a href=\"https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/70704032/\">achieved more at World Cups</a> and results-wise the USA are still the junior partner in a rivalry that began in 1977. But in the <a href=\"http://stats.espnscrum.com/statsguru/rugby/stats/index.html?class=1;opposition=25;page=2;team=11;template=results;type=team;view=results\">last 10 Can-Am games</a>, the Eagles have taken an unprecedented nine wins and a draw. Much of that has to do with American rugby professionalising faster, with hiccups of course, first in one year of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jul/29/pro-rugby-denver-stampede-ohio-aviators\">PRO</a> and now with two of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/17/seattle-major-league-rugby-mlr\">Major League Rugby</a>. A highly successful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/28/mike-friday-usa-rugby-sevens-las-vegas?CMP=share_btn_tw\">sevens</a> operation means all home-based national players are paid to play, like those who go overseas.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Canada versus USA means something. We are fully expecting a brutal Test, no quarter given</p> <footer> <cite>Blaine Scully</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Not counting sevens players Madison Hughes, Martin Iosefo and Ben Pinkelman, Scully, a wing or full-back, is the only man in the pre-World Cup squad currently lacking a club. He spent two years in England with Leicester and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/48209087\">four in Wales with Cardiff</a> before coming home this summer. He won\u2019t be drawn on whether he\u2019s headed for MLR any more than he will predict another win over Canada.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s always a highly contested Test match,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I was first involved, we didn\u2019t win very often. We\u2019ve been fortunate in the last year or two. The challenge for us this summer is that this is the best Canadian team we\u2019ve played in a number of years because they\u2019ve had some availability challenges. Now their best players are here.</p> <p>\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s on the field, Canada versus USA means something. We are fully expecting a brutal Test, no quarter given by either side.\u201d</p> <p>Quite right. Every four years the World Cup comes around and teams gather their best players together. Canada, under the former Wales flanker Kingsley Jones, scraped into the draw <a href=\"https://www.rugbyworldcup.com/news/381786\">via the repechage</a> but they have a squad heavy with tournament experience.</p> <p>Scully has been to two World Cups, in New Zealand in 2011 as a product of <a href=\"https://www.dailycal.org/2019/05/05/no-1-cal-falls-to-no-2-life-in-rugby-national-championship/\">Cal Berkeley</a> and in England four years later as a seasoned pro. Now he\u2019s a veteran of eight games in two tournaments that have produced one win, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/sep/15/rugby-world-cup-russia-usa-live\">against Russia eight years ago</a>. There is a sense now that no American team has gone in stronger. The Eagles won nine times in 2018 including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/jun/18/usa-scotland-gary-gold-aj-macginty-major-league-rugby\">victory over Scotland in Houston</a>, their first over a tier-one team. But there have been stumbles since and whichever way you look at it, the draw is pitilessly hard.</p> <p>They will also be without a pitilessly hard player, the back-rower Samu Manoa, formerly of Northampton, Toulon and Cardiff. Now with the MLR-champion Seattle Seawolves he was named in Gold\u2019s training squad but then announced his Test retirement. Five years ago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jun/06/usa-eagles-scotland-houston-vern-cotter\">before another summer Test against the Scots</a>, Scully told the Guardian how much Manoa would be missed. The same applies now.</p> <p>\u201cObviously he had a hugely successful professional career overseas,\u201d Scully says, \u201cand everyone kind of makes those personal decisions whenever it\u2019s best for them. We first and foremost want him to be happy and healthy. It\u2019s unfortunate the timing didn\u2019t work out from a Rugby World Cup point of view, but we\u2019re grateful for his time that he spent with the Eagles.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"169669865fc33963af6e7189afe58a3fcfd56a76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/169669865fc33963af6e7189afe58a3fcfd56a76/0_236_4104_2462/1000.jpg\" alt=\"AJ MacGinty sets up a try for the flanker Hanco Germishuys during USA\u2019s win over Scotland last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">AJ MacGinty sets up a try for flanker Hanco Germishuys during USA\u2019s win over Scotland last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Gibson/Fotosport/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over games against Canada, Samoa and Japan in the Pacific Nations Cup, then another Test against the Canadians, who fills the hole left by Manoa will be one subplot to watch.

Training has been competitive. \u201cWe were in Colorado Springs for two weeks,\u201d says Scully, down the phone, \u201cand for the last two weeks we\u2019ve been here in Glendale. And so we\u2019ve had a pretty good block together. A lot of high-intensity fitness work, a lot of foundational work, building pieces we are going to need.\u201d Canada have achieved more at World Cups and results-wise the USA are still the junior partner in a rivalry that began in 1977. But in the last 10 Can-Am games, the Eagles have taken an unprecedented nine wins and a draw. Much of that has to do with American rugby professionalising faster, with hiccups of course, first in one year of PRO and now with two of Major League Rugby. A highly successful sevens operation means all home-based national players are paid to play, like those who go overseas. Not counting sevens players Madison Hughes, Martin Iosefo and Ben Pinkelman, Scully, a wing or full-back, is the only man in the pre-World Cup squad currently lacking a club. He spent two years in England with Leicester and four in Wales with Cardiff before coming home this summer. He won\u2019t be drawn on whether he\u2019s headed for MLR any more than he will predict another win over Canada. \u201cIt\u2019s always a highly contested Test match,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I was first involved, we didn\u2019t win very often. We\u2019ve been fortunate in the last year or two. The challenge for us this summer is that this is the best Canadian team we\u2019ve played in a number of years because they\u2019ve had some availability challenges. Now their best players are here. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s on the field, Canada versus USA means something. We are fully expecting a brutal Test, no quarter given by either side.\u201d Quite right. Every four years the World Cup comes around and teams gather their best players together. Canada, under the former Wales flanker Kingsley Jones, scraped into the draw via the repechage but they have a squad heavy with tournament experience. Scully has been to two World Cups, in New Zealand in 2011 as a product of Cal Berkeley and in England four years later as a seasoned pro. Now he\u2019s a veteran of eight games in two tournaments that have produced one win, against Russia eight years ago. There is a sense now that no American team has gone in stronger. The Eagles won nine times in 2018 including victory over Scotland in Houston, their first over a tier-one team. But there have been stumbles since and whichever way you look at it, the draw is pitilessly hard. They will also be without a pitilessly hard player, the back-rower Samu Manoa, formerly of Northampton, Toulon and Cardiff. Now with the MLR-champion Seattle Seawolves he was named in Gold\u2019s training squad but then announced his Test retirement. Five years ago, before another summer Test against the Scots, Scully told the Guardian how much Manoa would be missed. The same applies now. \u201cObviously he had a hugely successful professional career overseas,\u201d Scully says, \u201cand everyone kind of makes those personal decisions whenever it\u2019s best for them. We first and foremost want him to be happy and healthy. It\u2019s unfortunate the timing didn\u2019t work out from a Rugby World Cup point of view, but we\u2019re grateful for his time that he spent with the Eagles.\u201d Over games against Canada, Samoa and Japan in the Pacific Nations Cup, then another Test against the Canadians, who fills the hole left by Manoa will be one subplot to watch. How the MLR players perform will be another. None will lack for motivation, particularly with three Premiership picks \u2013 Saracens prop Titi Lamositele, Worcester hooker Joe Taufete\u2019e and Harlequins centre Paul Lasike \u2013 all coming back from injury. AJ MacGinty, the Sale fly-half, a vital cog in the machine, is fit. \u201cWe\u2019re obviously discussing the Rugby World Cup and everyone wants to be on that plane,\u201d Scully says, asked to look ahead to kick-off against England in Kobe on 26 September. \u201cBut in order for us to be in a position to do that we need to be focused on our training and these matches in the PNC.\u201d \u201cCertain elements of our game\u201d, he adds, must be \u201crock solid and foundational\u201d. Necessities for any minnow swimming with a big fish include a pack that can hold its ground and the best defence possible. In Scully\u2019s first World Cup, ceaseless tackling held Ireland to 22-10 in New Plymouth. In London in his second, a 64-0 thumping by South Africa was much tougher going. Head coach Gold is South African and so is defence coach Jaque Fourie, a World Cup-winning centre in 2007. Scully speaks highly of both. Fourie, he says, has \u201ca hugely successful pedigree as a player, and he\u2019s got a great intensity, and he has the respect of everyone involved because he\u2019s been there and done that in a lot of different ways. He\u2019s helping us all get better.\u201d",

Hopefully, it keeps building not just every four years [after a World Cup], but hopefully, it\u2019s every year.\u201d</p> <p>This would seem to be the NWSL\u2019s challenge. A month after the US won the Women\u2019s World Cup in 2015, Sky Blue FC attracted 5,547 for a game to Yurcak Field. But their average home attendance dropped in 2016, rose in 2017, then dropped again in 2018.</p> <p>Sky Blue FC have not qualified for the NWSL playoffs the last five years, and after undergoing a coaching change last month, are likely to keep that streak going.

      "bodyText": "Wednesday\u2019s match had been over for 20 minutes when hundreds of girls, holding posters and T-shirts and patiently standing at a rail that separated the bleachers from the pitch, spotted their favorite player and began to shout as one: Car-li! Car-li! Car-li! Car-li! Carli Lloyd, the 37-year-old captain of Sky Blue FC and a veteran of four Women\u2019s World Cups, would sign autographs and pose for selfies, because that is what she always does. There was a big difference, though: Lloyd\u2019s team had just played before a loud and rare sellout crowd. Sky Blue FC had expected a big crowd for the first home game since Lloyd returned from the Women\u2019s World Cup in France. But the grandstand at Yurcak Field, a soccer ground on the campus of Rutgers University, was filled with 5,003 fans, three times the size of an average turnout at home. \u201cThe biggest thing is just kind of making everybody aware that we do have a league,\u201d Lloyd said after the 1-0 loss to the Washington Spirit in the eight-team National Women\u2019s Soccer League. \u201cThere are a lot of people who have no idea that there is a National Women\u2019s Soccer League, a women\u2019s soccer league. There are some kids I had interactions with who had no idea that there\u2019s a league. That\u2019s a problem. We need to make sure everyone is aware.\u201d At the very least, many more people are buying tickets, even to a match involving Sky Blue FC, the NWSL team with the most outdated stadium, the poorest record (two wins, nine losses and two draws) and lowest average home attendance: 1,501 before Wednesday. The US team\u2019s success this summer appears to have changed that. The attendance for the four home teams (Utah, Chicago, Orlando and Washington) in the first match week with World Cup players back topped a combined 48,000, twice those clubs\u2019 combined previous season averages. \u201cI hope that it\u2019s not just kind of like a one-week thing,\u201d said Rose Lavelle, the 24-year-old Washington Spirit midfielder who scored a goal for the US in the World Cup final. \u201cI hope that people keep coming back and seeing this league is something special, and this league is very competitive. Hopefully, it keeps building not just every four years [after a World Cup], but hopefully, it\u2019s every year.\u201d This would seem to be the NWSL\u2019s challenge. A month after the US won the Women\u2019s World Cup in 2015, Sky Blue FC attracted 5,547 for a game to Yurcak Field. But their average home attendance dropped in 2016, rose in 2017, then dropped again in 2018. Sky Blue FC have not qualified for the NWSL playoffs the last five years, and after undergoing a coaching change last month, are likely to keep that streak going. Alyse LaHue, the interim general manager, has said the team is looking for a new home field. \u201cRutgers has been a great partner for years,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it\u2019s time for us to grow up.\u201d The NWSL has scored two enormous business deals post-World Cup, agreeing with ESPN to televise 14 of its games this year and swinging a multi-year sponsorship with Anheuser-Busch to make Budweiser the league\u2019s first official beer sponsor. LaHue has had ongoing discussions with potential sponsors for Sky Blue FC, but she acknowledged that large crowds like Wednesday\u2019s would help her cause. After a three-game road trip, Sky Blue FC will play six of their last eight games at home. Two of those games will be against the Chicago Red Stars, whose roster includes USWNT players Alyssa Naeher and Julie Ertz and Australia striker Sam Kerr. LaHue said advance sales for an August home match against Reign FC, who have the undoubted star of the World Cup, Megan Rapinoe, have been particularly strong. Sky Blue FC defender Estelle Johnson, a native of Fort Collins, Colorado, who played for Cameroon in the Women\u2019s World Cup, said, \u201cI think the key here is just to keep it going through the season.\u201d LaHue, who had been the general manager for five years for Chicago, is optimistic that the piggyback effect from the World Cup to the NWSL could be longer lasting than it was in 2015, calling the US victory \u201calmost a cultural moment for us and for women\u2019s sports\u201d. The stars of the 2019 US team, Rapinoe in particular, are bigger celebrities than they were in 2015, but they have also been engaged in a public effort to be paid as much as those who play for the much less successful US men\u2019s national team. \u201cWhat they\u2019ve done off the field will have repercussions that will last much longer than their victory,\u201d she said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about women\u2019s soccer anymore. It\u2019s a bigger conversation.\u201d So far, so good. Prior to Wednesday, LaHue thought the match against Reign FC would be the first sellout for Sky Blue FC. She expected a good turnout for the match against the Spirit, but there was a surprising game-day surge in individual and group ticket sales. \u201cI said, \u2018Holy cow, we\u2019re going to be out of tickets!\u2019 \u201c LaHue said, smiling. Because Rutgers has changed concessionaires, Sky Blue FC were also out of beer, an element as important to a soccer game as a scoreboard with replays \u2013 which Sky Blue FC do not have, either.

      "bodyText": "More than half of the Victorian rubbish usually handled by stricken recycling operator SKM will be sent to the tip after the company told 30 local councils it could no longer collect material from them. Victorian minister for the environment, Lily D\u2019Ambrosio, said other operators had the capacity to absorb about 40% of the approximately 300,000 tonnes of recycling handled by SKM every year, leaving about 180,000 tonnes destined for landfill. She said that a contingency plan put together by the Labor government and councils to deal with the crisis would increase the capacity of other operators to take on the extra load, but did not say how long it would be before no recycling was sent to landfill and refused to say how much the plan would cost or who would pay for it.

If you look at other lineups \u2013 with George Ezra at five or six festivals \u2013 this is something a bit different.\u201d</p> <p>The smaller festivals that have sprung up across the UK, both specialist events like Black Deer and what are called \u201csecondary festivals\u201d, have become a crucial part of the musical ecosystem in recent years. Festivals in provincial towns, often supported by local councils, rarely attract the buzziest young artists. But the biggest secondary festivals \u2013 such as <a href=\"https://www.victoriousfestival.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Victorious</a> in Portsmouth, the <a href=\"https://nbhdweekender.com/\" title=\"\">Neighbourhood Weekender</a> in Warrington, <a href=\"https://www.hitthenorthfestival.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Hit the North</a> in Newcastle, or any of the scores of events you see advertised as you drive around the country, often seeming to feature the Lightning Seeds and/or Razorlight \u2013 offer current bands the chance to reach new audiences, and to prolong their album campaigns.</p> <p>They can also score big names: Gloucester\u2019s 3,000-capacity <a href=\"https://www.barnonthefarm.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Barn on the Farm</a> secured George Ezra and Lewis Capaldi for its 10th anniversary earlier this month. They also provide a summer of money-making for heritage acts, and a leg-up for local groups. Yet they rarely feature in newspaper festival guides or in the music magazines: it is as if they operate in a separate universe.</p> <p>Take Victorious, headlined this year by Two Door Cinema Club, Rudimental and New Order \u2013 perfectly reasonable for a mid-level festival. Except Victorious isn\u2019t a mid-level festival. Its capacity of 90,000 puts it behind only Glastonbury and Download among UK events. What\u2019s more, it is cheap, with single-day prices ranging from \u00a325 to \u00a345, depending on when you buy. Early-bird buyers could get a ticket for the whole weekend for \u00a380, and even now you can get a weekend ticket, with camping, for \u00a3145 to see dozens of acts you have actually heard of.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09b5cb2860f9b37a6b485d8d3acf83ffea8f7dce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09b5cb2860f9b37a6b485d8d3acf83ffea8f7dce/0_310_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Audience members at Victorious in Portsmouth\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Secondary festivals\u2019, even those as big as Portsmouth\u2019s Victorious, attract a more diverse crowd than their better-known counterparts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Langford</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe started with a low ticket price and never wanted to jump up,\u201d the festival\u2019s director, Andy Marsh, says. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t want to bring in the Coldplays of this world and then have to charge \u00a3300 a ticket. It\u2019s a big family festival, too, so if you\u2019re bringing the kids, you don\u2019t want to be spending hundreds of pounds.\u201d</p> <p>And while you may look at the lineup of an event such as Victorious and think it was put together by repeatedly sticking a pin into the Guinness Book of Hit Singles, that\u2019s not the case. Just because secondary festivals aren\u2019t mounted for the people with clashfinder spreadsheets and an encyclopedic knowledge of Warp Records B-sides doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t carefully configured. The aim is to put on a festival at which almost anyone can find four or five things they want to see on any given day, and that means spending money on lots of artists with a handful of singalong hits, rather than piling it on headliners.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to weigh up how many tickets an act will sell compared with someone half the price,\u201d Marsh says of his booking strategy. \u201cVictorious is about people who\u2019ve maybe got a couple of kids now, but still want to go and enjoy a festival, whether it be for a day or an afternoon. That\u2019s our core demographic. We don\u2019t have dance tents, to keep the family atmosphere going.\u201d</p> <p>There are artists Marsh wouldn\u2019t book, even though he could afford them, because they might alter Victorious\u2019s brand as something for all the family. \u201cYou know they would sell tickets, but is it the right ticket? That could harm you for years to come,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Marsh maintains that the wider industry is now waking up to the opportunities secondary festivals provide, and how important they are to older artists, especially. That is backed up by James Sandom, who manages Kaiser Chiefs, Interpol, the Vaccines and Belle and Sebastian. He sees the events as crucial for growing the business of his artists. \u201cThese festivals offer an entry point for younger fans, or for people who don\u2019t necessarily want a full weekend of craft beers, luxury camping and leftfield music,\u201d he says. His bands play these festivals after a long album campaign when awareness has been built up, or before they release their next one, as somewhere they can road test new songs. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t drain the hard market\u201d \u2013 the regular cities a band would visit on tour \u2013 \u201cbecause they\u2019re often not in those catchment areas.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e88cf43974f2ff5759765be88859d09955605688\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e88cf43974f2ff5759765be88859d09955605688/0_287_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lewis Capaldi performing at Barn on the Farm, Gloucester\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lewis Capaldi performing at Barn on the Farm, Gloucester, this summer</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sandom says a headline slot at a big secondary event such as Victorious or the Neighbourhood Weekender pays the same as being third on the bill at a frontline festival.

In 2015, he was the subject of an internal investigation after he referred to a fellow councillor as a \u201cbeefcake\u2019\u2019 during a council debate. And earlier this week, during a council debate, he is reported to have compared a female councillor to an elephant, saying: \u201csome people have got more hide than Jessie the elephant and look like that\u201d, the Newcastle Herald reports. Clausen accused Robinson of \u201crelentless sexism and homophobic bullying\u201d, and called on him to resign. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be the openly gay deputy lord mayor of a community that had the highest \u2018yes\u2019 vote of any non-capital city in Australia,\u201d Clausen said in a statement. \u201cThe Newcastle I know is a welcoming and increasingly diverse community. \u201cSuch behaviour would simply not be tolerated in any other workplace. \u201cIf he cannot change his behaviour, Robinson should resign.\u201d He was responding to questions about Robinson\u2019s comments in his email to the Herald journalist. Guardian Australia has not seen a copy of the email, but in a phone interview Robinson read out its contents in full, then repeated the term a number of times. He then made several other homophobic remarks, while denying they were offensive. \u201cWhy should it be offensive?\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a fucking poof, you\u2019re a poof.\u201d When asked about allegations of sexism, Robinson said he had \u201cno problem with women\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>In the final pages of Colson Whitehead\u2019s forceful and tightly wrought novel, Millie, new partner to the main character, recalls: \u201cIt was hard to remember sometimes how bad it used to be \u2013 bending to a colored fountain when she visited her family in Virginia, the immense exertion white people put into grinding them down \u2013 and then it all returned in a rush, set off by tiny things, like standing on a corner trying to hail a cab \u2026 [and] by the big things, a drive through a blighted neighborhood snuffed out by that same immense exertion, or another boy shot dead by a cop.\u201d</p> <p>When I first came to live in Virginia four years ago, friends made jokes, with raised eyebrows, about how we were moving \u201cto the South\u201d. I didn\u2019t really worry, because to me Virginia didn\u2019t seem particularly southerly. Virginia wasn\u2019t Alabama, wasn\u2019t Florida \u2013 the setting for Whitehead\u2019s novel. Yet in Virginia, at the time of my birth, my parents (one white, one black) would have been forbidden to marry. Following Brown v Board of Education in 1954, Virginia successfully opposed desegregating schools for decades. A neighbour who lives in one of the older houses in the area told me that the deeds for his house contain a clause forbidding its sale to non-whites. \u201cUnenforceable today,\u201d he half smiled. His parents are immigrants from Pakistan.</p> <p>On trips further south, to Mississippi, Tennessee and Florida itself, I started to ask people in their 70s and older \u2013 not black people, but white people \u2013 what it was like to grow up in the era of segregation. I was curious to know how it felt to be able to order a black person to the back of the bus, have black people step aside for you in the street, to always sit in the best seats in the cinema. Those privileges had been lost in living memory, and yet much of the US treats the issue of segregation as if it belongs to ancient history. I have had these conversations with white people in South Africa, and yet every single American I talked to claimed not to be able to remember. One man told me that the town where he had been raised had been a \u201cprogressive\u201d sort of place, where these things didn\u2019t happen. Shortly after our conversation the New York Times ran a spread about a lynching that had taken place there in 1935, before my interlocutor\u2019s birth, but at a time when his parents certainly lived there. The victim\u2019s name was Elwood Higginbotham.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2c9c83982fdda0c4b99f7c299e50b3a8f188ba4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2c9c83982fdda0c4b99f7c299e50b3a8f188ba4/0_374_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colson Whitehead in New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colson Whitehead in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ramin Talaie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elwood is also the name of one of the protagonists of <em>The Nickel Boys</em>. Elwood Curtis grows up at the time of Brown v Board of Education, listening to the speeches of Martin Luther King and imbibing every word. Elwood\u2019s grandmother Harriet, who is raising him, is less convinced; not of the need for civil rights, for she takes part in the bus boycott once she\u2019s assured herself that everyone else is doing the same, but about sticking your head above the parapet. Whitehead has a gift for summarising the essence of a person\u2019s nature in a few lines: \u201cShe kept a sugarcane machete under her pillow for intruders, and it was difficult for Elwood to think that the old woman was afraid of anything. But fear was her fuel.\u201d</p> <p>Elwood works hard and gets good grades, attracting the attention of a new teacher at his school, who is also a civil rights activist and gets him into free classes at a coloured college south of Tallahassee. Hitchhiking there, Elwood picks the wrong driver from whom to accept a ride: \u201cWhen Rodney shook his hand, the rings on his fingers made Elwood wince.\u201d Rodney is a car thief and soon the pair are pulled over by police. And through this one small error of judgment, Elwood\u2019s life is changed when he is sent to a reform school called Nickel. There he is under the rule of superintendent Maynard Spencer, \u201cwho moved with a deliberate air, as if he rehearsed everything in front of a mirror \u2026 Spencer was fastidious with his dark blue Nickel uniform; every crease in his clothes looked sharp enough to cut, as if he were a living blade.\u201d </p> <p>According to Whitehead\u2019s acknowledgments page, <em>The Nickel Boys</em> was inspired by the true story of the Arthur G Dozier School for Boys in the small panhandle town of Marianna in Florida. After numerous reports and finally an investigation, including the excavation of a number of unmarked graves by a team of archaeology students in 2012, NPR reported that some<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2012/10/15/162941770/floridas-dozier-school-for-boys-a-true-horror-story\" title=\"\"> 81 boys had died there</a>. Dozier only closed its doors in 2011, and many of its former inmates are still only in their 60s. Although Whitehead is clear that Nickel, the characters and their stories are fiction, he has been true to many of the details of the Dozier regime: the brutal night-time beatings, in which boys were snatched from their beds and taken to a place called the White House, and the killings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96b89a31f1e982ec864daee2e533e664ede5175e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96b89a31f1e982ec864daee2e533e664ede5175e/0_74_1300_780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The grounds of the Boot Hill cemetery at the Dozier school.

For the most part this restraint adds to the book\u2019s impact, underlining the detachment with which the violence was enacted. There are other times, though, when Whitehead slides over key moments that would seem to beg for more detail: Elwood\u2019s conviction and sentencing, for example (we skip from the moment of his arrest to his incarceration), and another scene which I can\u2019t describe without spoiling the book, but which also left this reader wondering exactly how a seemingly inescapable moment unfolded. Instead of the violence, Whitehead homes in on the way in which every action fits into a fully orchestrated whole, which is why I would wish everyone, black or white, to read this novel. He demonstrates to superb effect how racism in America has long operated as a codified and sanctioned activity intended to enrich one group at the expense of another. Racism and white supremacy are the ideologies underpinning the economic exploitation of black people, once given legal force by Jim Crow laws. These laws put power into the hands of ordinary white people. A white person could have a black person arrested for \u201cbumptious contact\u201d \u2013 not giving way on the sidewalk, say. The system benefited ordinary white people, from the shopkeepers who resold the food supplies meant for the reform school boys, to the housewife who had her gazebo painted at no cost. Thus, ordinary white people were invested in sustaining the system, including what took place at schools like Nickel. For that was where black boys who did not submit early ended up.</p> <p>Elwood\u2019s best friend in Nickel is Turner, who seems to have learned the reality of survival faster than most. Turner was \u201csimultaneously at home in whatever scene he found himself and also seemed like he shouldn\u2019t have been there; inside and above at the same time; a part and apart. Like a tree trunk that falls across a creek \u2013 it doesn\u2019t belong and then it\u2019s never not been there, generating its own ripples in the larger current.\u201d Turner is affable, artful, cunning and kind; a boy who might have enjoyed the freewheeling adventures of a Huck Finn, if only he hadn\u2019t been born black. Turner isn\u2019t interested in Dr King\u2019s notion of how the world should work; instead, he is clear-eyed about how it does work and how it might work for him. At Nickel boys are supposed to be able to advance their release date through good behaviour, but nobody really knows how the system of merits and demerits works. With Turner\u2019s help, Elwood figures out that all that really matters are the whims of the white person in charge. Nickel is a microcosm of a corrupt world, in which the rule of law is meaningless and the real laws are unwritten.</p> <p>Last month the Washington Post reported a supreme court ruling that Mississippi prosecutors engaged in a \u201crelentless and determined effort\u201d to exclude African Americans from a jury considering the case of another African American (whose first name this time was coincidentally Curtis), thus denying him a fair trial. So far Curtis Flowers has been tried six times, going back to the 1990s.</p> <p>\u201cTheir daddies taught them how to keep a slave in line, passed down this brutal heirloom,\u201d writes Whitehead. \u201cThey waited for wayward boys in need of an attitude adjustment. They wait still, as long as the sons \u2013 and the sons of those sons \u2013 remember.\u201d In the American south, for both black and white people, the memories and the wait go on.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Aminatta Forna is the author of Happiness, published by Bloomsbury.

      "bodyText": "Former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett has accused a state Labor backbencher who kicked in a door at a Canberra hotel of misusing mental health as a reason for poor behaviour. Will Fowles smashed a door at the Abode hotel during a confrontation with staff over his luggage on Thursday morning. Police have questioned the MP for the Melbourne seat of Burwood but he has not been charged over the incident. Fowles has apologised for his behaviour, citing mental health and addiction issues and has vowed to foot the damage bill. Kennett, who founded beyondblue in 2000 to raise awareness of depression, was unsympathetic to Fowles\u2019 explanation. \u201cWhat I object to very much indeed is him using the coverall of a mental health illness in any way contributing to this act,\u201d Kennett told 3AW radio on Friday. \u201cMental health does not lead to acts of violence, criminality or antisocial behaviour, in a majority of cases. Alcohol and drugs do, but not mental health. I think this is an unacceptable use of mental health as an issue.\u201d The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, dismissed Kennett\u2019s comments and stood by his newly elected backbencher. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be easy to admit to the world you have a wide range of problems and he\u2019s done that,\u201d Andrews told reporters in Bendigo. Andrews said he hasn\u2019t spoken to the MP directly since the incident. \u201cIn the months and years ahead \u2013 as regrettable, as unacceptable as his conduct was in Canberra \u2013 hopefully he\u2019ll be able to look back \u2026 and say that was a turning point and he got the care and support and treatment he needed to turn his life around,\u201d he said. Asked if MPs should be drug and alcohol tested, Andrews said his government had unsuccessfully tried to introduce the measure in 2016 but couldn\u2019t get agreement in the parliament. Andrews noted his government had given empathy and respect to an MP on the other side of politics who had been experiencing personal problems and acknowledged politics can be a rough game. In a statement issued on Thursday afternoon, Fowles said his behaviour was unacceptable and he was \u201cdeeply ashamed\u201d of his actions. \u201cWhile there are reasons for it, there are no excuses,\u201d he said. \u201cI have, for a long time, been dealing with addiction and other mental health issues.

Razak, who denies any wrongdoing, lost a general election in May 2018, after the opposition capitalised on public mistrust of his government. The first expos\u00e9 on the scandal was by the website Sarawak Report in February 2015. The government reacted by banning the site, citing \u201cactivities detrimental to parliamentary democracy\u201d and \u201cspreading false news\u201d, according to its founder, British journalist Clare Rewcastle Brown. In July 2015, the Edge newspaper group published further stories on the fund. Days later, the Edge weekly was banned from publishing for three months under PPPA as the home ministry branded their coverage \u201cprejudicial or likely to be prejudicial to public order\u201d. \u201cIt is a situation where the government has so much power, to the point where really it\u2019s hard for journalists to do anything,\u201d said Steven Gan, editor-in-chief of independent news site Malaysiakini. \u201cIf this new government can implement those reforms, that will send us, hopefully, on a path where whoever is in power will not be able to do so much damage.\u201d Mahathir, who heads the Pakatan Harapan coalition, came to power promising several pro-democratic reforms, including greater press freedom. Reformers are cautiously optimistic. In 1987, during Mahathir\u2019s last tenure as prime minister, four newspapers were suspended during a mass crackdown on dissent. By 2001, the Committee to Protect Journalists had named Mahathir one of the 10 \u201cworst enemies of the press,\u201d a list that included Fidel Castro and Vladimir Putin. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that he really has had an epiphany and understands that he was brought to power on a pretty genuine democratic mandate,\u201d said Shawn Crispin, senior south-east Asia representative for CPJ. \u201cEyes wide open, because we remember very well who Mahathir was.\u201d Some argue the underlying conditions have changed in Malaysia, and that Mahathir\u2019s new political allies \u2013 if not the man himself \u2013 have the will to deliver. The proposed media council, which would resemble watchdogs like the UK\u2019s Independent Press Standards Organisation, would offer a first port of call for members of the public or government wishing to complain about news coverage. It would aim to raise ethical and journalistic standards across Malaysia. \u201cThe government wants to see a free press, free from fear of being sued in the court of law; free from being imposed with million-dollar penalties through the court processes,\u201d said Kadir Jasin, a retired newspaper editor now serving as Mahathir\u2019s media adviser. \u201cWhat we\u2019re looking for is that it will reduce the necessity to bring dissatisfaction with the media to the courts.\u201d Specific details, such as how much power the council should have, who will fund it, and who will sit on its committee, are yet to be decided.",

That\u2019s the news I heard.\u201d For all Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s well-documented hostility to indigenous rights, an aerial assault on the Amazon seems far-fetched. But campaigners believe that under Brazil\u2019s new administration indigenous communities face their most severe threat since military rulers bulldozed highways through the region nearly five decades ago, leaving behind a trail of death and environmental destruction. \u201cNot since the dictatorship have we lived through such a tough moment,\u201d said Jaime Siqueira, the head of the Indigenous Work Centre (CTI), a Brazilian NGO supporting indigenous communities fighting to defend their lands. Ewerton Marubo, a leader from the Javari Valley indigenous territory \u2013 an almost Portugal-sized hinterland sheltering Brazil\u2019s largest concentration of uncontacted tribes \u2013 said its 6,000 inhabitants were bracing for a new era of ruin. \u201cWe are in a situation of great danger. [Bolsonaro] is proving himself to be the number-one enemy of the indigenous,\u201d he said. On a steamy July evening, Ewerton was one of two dozen regional leaders gathered in Atalaia do Norte \u2013 the riverside portal to the Javari reserve \u2013 to discuss ways to defend it from the anticipated onslaught. Two days later caciques (chieftains) from the eight contacted tribes living in the region were due to hold an emergency summit at a village further west on the border with Peru. Like other indigenous territories in the Amazon, the Javari Valley \u2013 created in 1998 in an effort to protect its dwellers and their homes \u2013 has long suffered incursions from intruders seeking to cash in on its abundant natural resources. But as Bolsonaro ratchets up his anti-indigenous rhetoric and continues to dismantle Funai \u2013 the already chronically underfunded agency supposed to protect Brazil\u2019s 300-odd tribes \u2013 Javari leaders fear a dramatic deterioration. \u201cThe current government\u2019s dream is to exterminate the indigenous people so they can take our land,\u201d claimed Kevin Mayoruna, 39, a leader from Javari\u2019s Mats\u00e9s tribe who recently staged a protest in his village on the Jaquirana River.

Thousands of wildcat miners \u2013 apparently emboldened by Bolsonaro\u2019s repeated proclamations that indigenous territories were too big \u2013 have reportedly been pouring on to Yanomami lands near Brazil\u2019s border with Venezuela in search of gold. Further south in Rond\u00f4nia state, members of the Uru-eu-wau-wau tribe have been battling since January to keep armed land-grabbers off their 1.9m hectare reserve. But the stakes are particularly high in the Javari Valley, a balloon-shaped sweep of rainforests and rivers thought to house 16 \u201clost tribes\u201d living in voluntary isolation. For such groups \u2013 who can lack immunity to simple illnesses such as influenza \u2013 contact with outsiders can be fatal. Cristina Larra\u00edn, an Atalaia-based activist for the Indigenous Missionary Council (Cimi), said Javari\u2019s tribes were facing an intensifying assault from loggers, cattle ranchers, hunters, fishermen and wildcat goldminers, as well as oil companies over the border in Peru. Crippling budget cuts to Funai meant the agency had just 18 employees to stop intruders entering the 8.5m hectare enclave, and four other reserves further south. The agency \u2013 whose new Bolsonarian chief has horrified specialists \u2013 is so starved of resources that staff must buy anti-venom out of their own pockets before making perilous weeks-long missions into the Javari\u2019s snake-infested jungles. \u201cIt is an area the size of a country that is almost completely unprotected,\u201d Larra\u00edn said. \u201cI feel overwhelmed.\u201d Siqueira claimed Bolsonaro\u2019s \u201caggressive and condescending\u201d rhetoric towards Brazil\u2019s indigenous peoples had already given their \u201chistoric enemies\u201d the green light to accelerate their illegal advance into territories such as the Javari. \u201cIt\u2019s not just deforestation that has gone up in the Amazon [under Bolsonaro].

Being African American. Being physically challenged. And being assigned female. My mother told me those are three things that you\u2019re going to battle your whole life.\u201d</p> <p>His mother was right.

Bensimon began to transition in his 30s. A diminutive man with a neatly trimmed beard proudly wearing a sash proclaiming him \u201cMr Black Trans Kansas 2019\u201d, he now has a name reflecting his gender. He describes his mother as very supportive in recent years.</p> <p>But to this day, his Kansas birth certificate says that he is female.</p> <p>For Bensimon, having the state effectively deciding who and what he is was an intolerable position.

But you turn in that birth certificate and they\u2019re just like, \u2018Who is this?\u2019,\u201d said Bensimon.</p> <p>That is finally about to change in Kansas. Earlier this month, Governor Laura Kelly <a href=\"https://governor.kansas.gov/governor-applauds-action-that-clears-way-for-transgender-kansans-to-amend-sex-designation/\">said</a> it was time for the state \u201cto move past its outdated and discriminatory anti-transgender policy\u201d. After years of resistance to change by Republican governors, the Democrat elected to the state\u2019s top office last year withdrew opposition to a lawsuit by Bensimon and others seeking the right to say what is on their birth certificates.</p> <p>\u201cPeople say I\u2019m just trying to erase the past. No, I\u2019m not. But I can\u2019t play a role I\u2019m not meant to play. I\u2019m a bad actor,\u201d said Bensimon. \u201cIt\u2019s important. Maybe not for some people but it is for me.\u201d</p> <p>Omar Gonzalez-Pagan, a lawyer at Lambda Legal who has fought an array of cases on behalf of LGBT people, said Kelly\u2019s decision leaves only Ohio and Tennessee as the outliers in refusing to allow transgender people to amend the record of their birth (Gonzalez-Pagan has filed lawsuits against both remaining states).</p> <p>\u201cThe birth certificate is the quintessential document that is used for pretty much every aspect of your life. If you don\u2019t have a passport, the way you get employment is by showing your driver\u2019s licence and your birth certificate. Having a mismatch between your identity documents really exposes transgender people to discrimination when it comes to employment, education and everyday parts of their lives,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"11185ecfce7373cb1bb9afaa8e6cefaeaba39dd8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11185ecfce7373cb1bb9afaa8e6cefaeaba39dd8/0_0_3000_2161/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nyla Foster at home.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"720\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nyla Foster at home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Barrett Emke/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nyla Foster, who grew up in Kansas City where she works for a homeless charity, also took on the state.

That was the day I decided to come out,\u201d said Foster. Typically boys put on a wig or a skirt for laughs. Foster arrived at school in a bra and makeup, and with her hair styled.</p> <p>\u201cMy gender switch was very serious, it was very intentional. I looked like a natural girl. It wasn\u2019t comedic. It wasn\u2019t drag queen looking. It was very passable. Folks were confused. Gawking and staring. The administration said I was a disruption to the learning environment and escorted me home,\u201d she said.</p> <p>But Foster had broken a barrier and arrived at school the next day dressed the same way. \u201cI was sent home. Just leave. Eventually they suspended me and put me in an after-school programme, just me and a teacher. It was isolation basically. I was 14,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Foster describes that isolation as traumatising and said it contributed to a struggle to establish a normal life that at one point resulted in homelessness. Foster was able to change her driving licence but that wasn\u2019t good enough when applying for a job because it doesn\u2019t establish a right to live and work in the US. Without a passport, she was obliged to show her birth certificate.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I show a birth certificate that has my dead name that has a male sex on it, they are: \u2018Wait. Is this fraudulent? Is this real? Who is this person?\u2019 It\u2019s a piece of documentation that subjects me to discrimination. It outs me by having to present a document that I can\u2019t change,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Foster said forcible outing exposes her to harassment and violence.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s retraumatising. You never know who you\u2019re going to get. This is not a country where everyone\u2019s understanding, especially if you sound, act or look different. You\u2019re just subjected to how that person\u2019s going to respond,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s an epidemic of violence against trans women. Every time I walk out the house I put myself in danger.\u201d</p> <p>Two days after Kelly announced the policy change, an African American trans woman was found murdered on the Missouri side of Kansas City. The police said the circumstances were unclear but Brooklyn Lindsey, 32, appeared to have been shot in the face. Neighbours reported hearing an argument followed by gunfire in the middle of the night.</p> <p>The LGBT rights group the Human Rights Campaign has warned that the murder of transgender people is on the rise. Last year, one trans woman <a href=\"https://www.hrc.org/resources/violence-against-the-transgender-community-in-2019\">was killed every two weeks</a>, the majority of them black. This year, <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/27/texas-trans-black-women-murders-reality\">two murders within a fortnight</a> in Dallas have shaken the transgender community. One of the victims, Muhlaysia Booker, had been badly beaten a few weeks earlier in an attack described by Dallas\u2019s mayor, Mike Rawlings, as \u201cmob violence\u201d.</p> <p>Bensimon has turned his house in Topeka into a refuge for vulnerable younger transgender people, eight of whom live with him and call him dad. He said he feels particularly vulnerable to abuse and violence by other African Americans.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s horrible to say. A lot of times when I was in school and I was teased, it wasn\u2019t the white kids teasing me. It just wasn\u2019t. It was my own. That\u2019s where a lot of my non-acceptance comes from even today. I\u2019m very ashamed to say that. But it is what it is. It\u2019s true.

      "bodyText": "Luc Bensimon\u2019s mother knew early in her child\u2019s life that he would struggle. For a start, he was black in America. Then he was diagnosed with cerebral palsy on his right side, necessitating years of operations and physical therapy. But there was something else that Bensimon\u2019s mother only came to recognise years later: she assigned her son as female on his birth certificate because that is what his physical appearance told her. Bensimon, who is now 47, says he was \u201cborn with three strikes. Being African American. Being physically challenged. And being assigned female. My mother told me those are three things that you\u2019re going to battle your whole life.\u201d His mother was right. But for all the racism and physical struggle he endured, it is the fight to be recognised for who he is that has been the most demanding. \u201cI had a very strict religious upbringing. My uncle was a Baptist minister. My mom and my dad and I went to a Pentecostal church. My mom would dress me up for Easter in those ugly little dresses and I would just be angry,\u201d he said. Then there was puberty. \u201cI had to go get the training bra. I was just not OK with it. I guess my mom thought I was just rebelling and that was a teenage thing. So I told her in so many words that I\u2019m pretending to be something I\u2019m not comfortable being. My mom was, \u2018I\u2019m not OK with this\u2019,\u201d he said. Much has changed. Bensimon began to transition in his 30s. A diminutive man with a neatly trimmed beard proudly wearing a sash proclaiming him \u201cMr Black Trans Kansas 2019\u201d, he now has a name reflecting his gender. He describes his mother as very supportive in recent years. But to this day, his Kansas birth certificate says that he is female. For Bensimon, having the state effectively deciding who and what he is was an intolerable position. When he goes for a job, he\u2019s required to prove he is a US citizen. The birth certificate he has to give to HR outs him in what is all too often a hostile world. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the dead name [the name before transition] and then the gender. You might have been living for God knows how many years as the gender you were meant to be. But you turn in that birth certificate and they\u2019re just like, \u2018Who is this?\u2019,\u201d said Bensimon. That is finally about to change in Kansas.

      "body": "<p>James Lovelock has spent a lifetime pondering the forces that shape Earth. It was a pursuit that brought about his most famous creation: a view of the world where life maintains the conditions for life, which he niftily named Gaia theory.</p> <p>The hypothesis, as it was back then, was wholeheartedly embraced by the fledgling green movement of the 1970s.

It was a pursuit that brought about his most famous creation: a view of the world where life maintains the conditions for life, which he niftily named Gaia theory. The hypothesis, as it was back then, was wholeheartedly embraced by the fledgling green movement of the 1970s. But for Lovelock, who turned 100 on Friday, more pressing threats to the planet come from nature, not humans. In particular, he\u2019s worried about asteroids.

A ComRes survey for Christian Aid also found six out of 10 adults said the government was not doing enough about it and two-thirds agreed that Johnson should put the issue at the top of his agenda.</p> \n<p>Britain\u2019s heatwave this week demonstrated the urgency, said Laura Taylor from Christian Aid. The highest temperature recorded on Thursday was 38.1C in Cambridge. It is only the second time temperatures over 100F have been recorded in the UK, according to the Met Office. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/25/uk-railways-in-chaos-as-searing-heat-sparks-fear-of-derailed-trains\">Network Rail says disruption to services is likely to continue today</a> after delays caused by the threat that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/25/why-the-heatwave-is-disrupting-the-uk-railways\">rails could buckle in the heat</a> as well as sagging overhead lines.

Meanwhile the Stourbridge MP Margot James, who resigned as a minister to oppose a no-deal Brexit, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/26/tory-mp-margot-james-not-rule-out-quitting-party-massive-shift-right-brexit\">refused to rule out quitting the Conservative party</a> over concern that Boris Johnson\u2019s cabinet represents a \u201cmassive shift to the right\u201d. \u201cI still feel that he\u2019s been elected by the party and deserves a chance,\u201d said James, a former businesswoman. But if the manifesto was to leave without a deal, \u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t campaign for that\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a3e82956903e9ab802cc56dc41ebc0c38b28b61\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a3e82956903e9ab802cc56dc41ebc0c38b28b61/0_14_3557_2134/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margot James MP.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margot James MP.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>After Johnson appointed a series of rightwingers to his government, James raised concerns that some of the \u201cshady people\u201d around him and those who \u201cfunded the original referendum campaign\u201d would want to slash corporate taxes and regulations: \u201cThere is a cadre of owners of large private companies who want Brexit because they want a low-tax, low-regulation economy.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018Immoral and deeply flawed\u2019 \u2013 </strong>The US government has scheduled the execution of five death row federal inmates for December and January, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/25/death-penalty-capital-punishment-us-justice-department-resumes-executions\">first federal use of the death penalty in 16 years</a>, William Barr, the attorney general, has directed Hugh Hurwitz, acting head of federal prisons, to schedule the executions of five death-row inmates convicted of murdering children and elderly people. The executions are due to take place in the Terre Haute penitentiary in Indiana. They would use pentobarbital, a controversial lethal injection that often has to be mixed by a compounding pharmacy because no one else will supply it. Kamala Harris, a former prosecutor seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, wrote: \u201cLet me be clear: capital punishment is immoral and deeply flawed. Too many innocent people have been put to death. We need a national moratorium on the death penalty, not a resurrection.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Boat crossing disaster \u2013 </strong>Up to 150 people trying to cross the Mediterranean from Libya to Europe are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jul/25/up-to-150-people-may-have-died-in-shipwreck-off-libya-says-unhcr\">missing and feared drowned</a> after two boats capsized. Libya\u2019s coastguard said two boats carrying about 300 people capsized about 75 miles (120km) east of the capital, Tripoli, on Thursday. About 137 people were rescued and returned to Libya. Crossings to Europe usually peak in summer when the seas are calmer. European leaders have partnered with the Libyan coastguard and other Libyan forces to try and stop the crossings but rights groups say people seeking migration are left at the mercy of brutal armed groups or confined in squalid detention centres without adequate food and water. Judith Sunderland from Human Rights Watch said: \u201cInstead of taking responsibility themselves, EU countries have been propping up the Libyan coastguard without the resources or dedication to save lives at sea.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Judge alerted to mock-stabbing video \u2013 </strong>A teenager cleared of murdering his friend posted a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/26/boy-cleared-murder-sent-video-stabbing-motions-yousef-makki\">video of himself making stabbing motions</a> just hours after the acquittal. The 17-year-old boy, who can be referred to only as Boy A, admitted fatally stabbing Yousef Makki but successfully argued it was self-defence. Shortly after his acquittal the boy published a video of himself making a stabbing action and listening to drill music about \u201cshanks\u201d \u2013 slang for knives. The video was then sent by an unknown person to a member of Makki\u2019s family, causing them distress. The judge was alerted and Greater Manchester police has launched an investigation into the video.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>BA Cairo flights back on \u2013 </strong>British Airways is to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/26/british-airways-to-resume-flights-to-cairo-after-security-review\">resume flights to Cairo from today</a>, following a week\u2019s suspension over security concerns. Both BA and Lufthansa stopped flights last Saturday. The airlines, two of the biggest in Europe, gave little explanation. BA cited the \u201csafety and security of our customers and crew\u201d. In its travel advice for British nationals heading to Egypt, the Foreign Office warns: \u201cThere\u2019s a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation. Additional security measures are in place for flights departing from Egypt to the UK. You should cooperate fully with security officials at airports.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Fast track to moon \u2013 </strong>Nasa has decided that only the industrial corporation Northrop Grumman can supply it with an astronaut habitation module in time to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jul/25/nasa-fast-tracks-habitation-module-for-planned-moon-landing\">meet the White House\u2019s directive of landing humans on the moon again by 2024</a>. Usually it requests bids from industry but in this case decided it would take too much time. Northrop Grumman\u2019s habitation module will be based on its existing Cygnus cargo craft that currently supplies the International Space Station.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Climate crisis seen as more important Hello, Warren Murray here to help you get up on the news without breaking a sweat \u2026 Seventy-one percent of Britons believe climate change is more important in the long term than Brexit and should be a top priority for Boris Johnson\u2019s government. A ComRes survey for Christian Aid also found six out of 10 adults said the government was not doing enough about it and two-thirds agreed that Johnson should put the issue at the top of his agenda. Britain\u2019s heatwave this week demonstrated the urgency, said Laura Taylor from Christian Aid. The highest temperature recorded on Thursday was 38.1C in Cambridge. It is only the second time temperatures over 100F have been recorded in the UK, according to the Met Office. Network Rail says disruption to services is likely to continue today after delays caused by the threat that rails could buckle in the heat as well as sagging overhead lines. Large swaths of the UK have also experienced thunderstorms and lightning strikes related to the hot spell. They\u2019ve been baking on the continent too, of course \u2013 records of 42.6C have been reached in Paris, 40.4C in the Netherlands and 40.6C in Belgium. * * * \u2018Massive shift to the right\u2019 \u2013 There has been an embarrassing blip in Boris Johnson\u2019s plans after the leading Eurosceptic Steve Baker rejected a job on Boris Johnson\u2019s frontbench, saying he did not want to repeat the \u201cpowerlessness\u201d he felt as a junior minister under Theresa May. Meanwhile the Stourbridge MP Margot James, who resigned as a minister to oppose a no-deal Brexit, has refused to rule out quitting the Conservative party over concern that Boris Johnson\u2019s cabinet represents a \u201cmassive shift to the right\u201d. \u201cI still feel that he\u2019s been elected by the party and deserves a chance,\u201d said James, a former businesswoman. But if the manifesto was to leave without a deal, \u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t campaign for that\u201d. After Johnson appointed a series of rightwingers to his government, James raised concerns that some of the \u201cshady people\u201d around him and those who \u201cfunded the original referendum campaign\u201d would want to slash corporate taxes and regulations: \u201cThere is a cadre of owners of large private companies who want Brexit because they want a low-tax, low-regulation economy.\u201d * * * \u2018Immoral and deeply flawed\u2019 \u2013 The US government has scheduled the execution of five death row federal inmates for December and January, the first federal use of the death penalty in 16 years, William Barr, the attorney general, has directed Hugh Hurwitz, acting head of federal prisons, to schedule the executions of five death-row inmates convicted of murdering children and elderly people. The executions are due to take place in the Terre Haute penitentiary in Indiana. They would use pentobarbital, a controversial lethal injection that often has to be mixed by a compounding pharmacy because no one else will supply it. Kamala Harris, a former prosecutor seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, wrote: \u201cLet me be clear: capital punishment is immoral and deeply flawed. Too many innocent people have been put to death. We need a national moratorium on the death penalty, not a resurrection.\u201d * * * Boat crossing disaster \u2013 Up to 150 people trying to cross the Mediterranean from Libya to Europe are missing and feared drowned after two boats capsized. Libya\u2019s coastguard said two boats carrying about 300 people capsized about 75 miles (120km) east of the capital, Tripoli, on Thursday. About 137 people were rescued and returned to Libya. Crossings to Europe usually peak in summer when the seas are calmer. European leaders have partnered with the Libyan coastguard and other Libyan forces to try and stop the crossings but rights groups say people seeking migration are left at the mercy of brutal armed groups or confined in squalid detention centres without adequate food and water. Judith Sunderland from Human Rights Watch said: \u201cInstead of taking responsibility themselves, EU countries have been propping up the Libyan coastguard without the resources or dedication to save lives at sea.\u201d * * * Judge alerted to mock-stabbing video \u2013 A teenager cleared of murdering his friend posted a video of himself making stabbing motions just hours after the acquittal. The 17-year-old boy, who can be referred to only as Boy A, admitted fatally stabbing Yousef Makki but successfully argued it was self-defence. Shortly after his acquittal the boy published a video of himself making a stabbing action and listening to drill music about \u201cshanks\u201d \u2013 slang for knives. The video was then sent by an unknown person to a member of Makki\u2019s family, causing them distress. The judge was alerted and Greater Manchester police has launched an investigation into the video. * * * BA Cairo flights back on \u2013 British Airways is to resume flights to Cairo from today, following a week\u2019s suspension over security concerns. Both BA and Lufthansa stopped flights last Saturday. The airlines, two of the biggest in Europe, gave little explanation. BA cited the \u201csafety and security of our customers and crew\u201d. In its travel advice for British nationals heading to Egypt, the Foreign Office warns: \u201cThere\u2019s a heightened risk of terrorism against aviation. Additional security measures are in place for flights departing from Egypt to the UK. You should cooperate fully with security officials at airports.\u201d * * * Fast track to moon \u2013 Nasa has decided that only the industrial corporation Northrop Grumman can supply it with an astronaut habitation module in time to meet the White House\u2019s directive of landing humans on the moon again by 2024. Usually it requests bids from industry but in this case decided it would take too much time. Northrop Grumman\u2019s habitation module will be based on its existing Cygnus cargo craft that currently supplies the International Space Station. It will be part of the Lunar Gateway, a small space station in orbit around the moon that will act as a layover point for astronauts before they descend to the lunar surface. Today in Focus podcast: Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit cabinet This morning Jonathan Freedland talks about Boris Johnson\u2019s brutal cabinet reshuffle, which brings the members of the victorious Brexit campaign into the heart of government. And: Laura Snapes on the nominations for the Mercury music prize. Lunchtime read: Enslaved on a British cannabis farm Minh was 16 when he was kidnapped, raped and trafficked to the UK, then locked up and forced to grow cannabis. But when the police found him, he was treated like a criminal rather than a victim. Annie Kelly reports on the plight of hundreds of children trafficked from Vietnam every year and forced to work in hidden cannabis farms across the UK: small cogs in a vast criminal machine that supplies Britain\u2019s \u00a32.6bn cannabis black market. Sport Jack Leach said he now knew about the nervous nineties, after falling just eight runs short of a famous century as England\u2019s nightwatchman on day two of the Test against Ireland at Lord\u2019s. Geraint Thomas chased a fierce attack by his Team Ineos teammate Egan Bernal, yet still lost second place overall to the Colombian as the tension in the Tour de France ramped up another notch and the unflappable Julian Alaphilippe again clung on to his overall lead. Dave Brailsford has denied that Team Ineos have a growing disciplinary problem after his team\u2019s tactics were questioned and, for the second year running, one of his riders was kicked off the Tour for violent conduct. The Arsenal full-back Sead Kolasinac fought off two men wielding knives after he and his teammate Mesut \u00d6zil were attacked in north London. Everton have revealed the proposed designs for their new \u00a3500m stadium to be built on semi-derelict dockland in north Liverpool. And Cameron Bancroft has seemingly stormed into Australia\u2019s Ashes squad with an unbeaten match-winning knock of 93 that could result in him reuniting with David Warner at the top of the order for the first Test. Business The Trump administration has announced a compensation package for farmers hurt by the China trade war worth up to $16bn. Food producers, who have seen shipments to China slump amid the ongoing tit-for-tat dispute, will receive up to $160 per acre for affected crops. Google parent Alphabet has managed to record a profit of $9bn despite increased regulatory scrutiny, while inventor James Dyson has reportedly bought a second ultra-luxury home in Singapore. Alphabet\u2019s earnings were not enough to offset disappointing results elsewhere, sending Asian stocks down overnight. The FTSE100 is expected to open down as well, while the pound is at $1.245 and \u20ac1.116. The papers Boris Johnson and the heatwave dominate the front pages today, with papers featuring one or both stories as their leads. Among the papers splashing with the weather are the Daily Mail: \u201cBoiling point!\u201d and the Mirror: \u201cCool it\u201d. The Sun opts for both, with the headline: \u201cJohnsun\u201d alongside a highly disturbing image of the sun with the new prime minister\u2019s face, complete with fuzzy blond hair.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s quite common for movies \u2013 especially horror movies \u2013 to bolster their significance with a mid-trailer quote. You know, something like \u201cThis is the scariest film I have ever seen \u2013 Vanity Fair\u201d or \u201cThis film made me vomit blood into a child\u2019s lap \u2013 New York Times\u201d.</p> <p>Fred Durst\u2019s new film, The Fanatic, is no exception. Sixteen seconds into its new trailer, a quote arrives reading: \u201cYou are a fan. Without you I\u2019m nothing \u2013 Hunter Dunbar.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/24/see-you-soon-film-jenia-tanaeva\">Is See You Soon the most hilariously awful film of the year?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now, Hunter Dunbar isn\u2019t a movie reviewer I\u2019d heard of, so I Googled him. And it turns out that he isn\u2019t a reviewer at all. There are a few Hunter Dunbars in the world \u2013 one apparently works in the artificial intelligence field, another is something called a \u201cSalesforce architect\u201d \u2013 but none were responsible for the quote. Because Hunter Dunbar is the name of a character from The Fanatic.</p> <p>Let that sink in for a moment. Fred Durst made a horror film that goes out of its way to quote its own character in the trailer. But, oh, if that were the weirdest thing about The Fanatic.</p> <p>From the look of it, The Fanatic is every Bad Fan movie trope rolled into one. There are elements of Misery. There are elements of The King of Comedy. There are elements of One Hour Photo. There are elements of Patton Oswalt\u2019s decade-old dramatic curio Big Fan. A celebrity has a fan, the fan crosses a boundary, hijinks ensue. You have seen a million films like The Fanatic before. But at the same time it seems very, very unlikely that you have ever seen anything like The Fanatic. Because, to use a technical term, hoo boy.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRS6V8RXIKE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YRS6V8RXIKE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The most obvious place to start is casting, because The Fanatic stars John Travolta as the troubled fan. But maybe \u201cstars\u201d is the wrong term. Maybe \u201cis barely able to contain\u201d might be better, or \u201cgets eaten alive by\u201d. This is an interesting period for John Travolta, one destined to go down as his prosthetic era. After his turn in The People vs OJ Simpson, in which he played Robert Shapiro in the style of an alternate-reality David Gest, he appears to have grown fond of overhauling his look as dramatically as possible whenever he can. His John Gotti, for instance, ended up looking like what would happen if you let a child draw Donald Trump on an egg.</p> <p>But in The Fanatic, Travolta rolls the dice in a colossal way. His character, Moose, is a walking bundle of quirks and affectations that barely even register as human. He\u2019s wearing the wig of a man half his size. He\u2019s stooped and twitchy. He blinks like a man trying to gain secondary employment as a human staple gun. He stumbles around like a toddler with a poo-y nappy. It is acting you can see from space. The whole performance seems designed to be cut together for a celebratory Oscars highlight reel, without realising that it all takes place within <em>a horror movie directed by Fred Durst.</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"eac0b49b26936403078d041f861521810099fa03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eac0b49b26936403078d041f861521810099fa03/0_365_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fred Durst directing The Fanatic\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fred Durst directing The Fanatic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Douglas</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Travolta performance is what will draw the most attention to The Fanatic, but there are plenty of other grace notes if you look closely enough. Hunter Dunbar \u2013 the character, not the salesforce architect \u2013 is a Hollywood \u201caction hero\u201d who, if I\u2019ve got this right, is the star of a fictional film called Space Vampires. And, judging by the trailer, Hunter is also a celebrated author. At a signing, he sits in front of a poster for his autobiography that contains the quote \u201cA fascinating peek into the industry \u2013 Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, New York Times\u201d, leaving you convinced that three different newspapers gave the book an identical review.</p> <p>There\u2019s the shot of Hunter\u2019s award table, which contains what appear to be many novelty sex toys, each engraved with the words \u201cHunter Dunbar\u201d in the same font. There is, unless I am very much mistaken, a shot of a Hunter Dunbar voodoo doll carved out of butter. There\u2019s the ending, where Travolta staggers around with one of his eyes gouged out, possibly because he made the mistake of watching the rushes of his own film.</p> <p>If you\u2019d told me 20 years ago that John Travolta from The Thin Red Line would star in a film by Fred Durst from Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water, I would have told you to get out of of town. If you told me that now, I\u2019d still probably tell you to get out of town. But it happened, and The Fanatic exists, and wild horses couldn\u2019t stop me from watching it.</p> <ul> <li><p>The Fanatic is out in the US on 30 August with a UK date yet to be announced</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s quite common for movies \u2013 especially horror movies \u2013 to bolster their significance with a mid-trailer quote. You know, something like \u201cThis is the scariest film I have ever seen \u2013 Vanity Fair\u201d or \u201cThis film made me vomit blood into a child\u2019s lap \u2013 New York Times\u201d. Fred Durst\u2019s new film, The Fanatic, is no exception. Sixteen seconds into its new trailer, a quote arrives reading: \u201cYou are a fan. Without you I\u2019m nothing \u2013 Hunter Dunbar.\u201d Now, Hunter Dunbar isn\u2019t a movie reviewer I\u2019d heard of, so I Googled him. And it turns out that he isn\u2019t a reviewer at all. There are a few Hunter Dunbars in the world \u2013 one apparently works in the artificial intelligence field, another is something called a \u201cSalesforce architect\u201d \u2013 but none were responsible for the quote. Because Hunter Dunbar is the name of a character from The Fanatic. Let that sink in for a moment. Fred Durst made a horror film that goes out of its way to quote its own character in the trailer. But, oh, if that were the weirdest thing about The Fanatic. From the look of it, The Fanatic is every Bad Fan movie trope rolled into one. There are elements of Misery. There are elements of The King of Comedy. There are elements of One Hour Photo. There are elements of Patton Oswalt\u2019s decade-old dramatic curio Big Fan. A celebrity has a fan, the fan crosses a boundary, hijinks ensue. You have seen a million films like The Fanatic before. But at the same time it seems very, very unlikely that you have ever seen anything like The Fanatic. Because, to use a technical term, hoo boy. The most obvious place to start is casting, because The Fanatic stars John Travolta as the troubled fan. But maybe \u201cstars\u201d is the wrong term. Maybe \u201cis barely able to contain\u201d might be better, or \u201cgets eaten alive by\u201d. This is an interesting period for John Travolta, one destined to go down as his prosthetic era. After his turn in The People vs OJ Simpson, in which he played Robert Shapiro in the style of an alternate-reality David Gest, he appears to have grown fond of overhauling his look as dramatically as possible whenever he can. His John Gotti, for instance, ended up looking like what would happen if you let a child draw Donald Trump on an egg. But in The Fanatic, Travolta rolls the dice in a colossal way. His character, Moose, is a walking bundle of quirks and affectations that barely even register as human. He\u2019s wearing the wig of a man half his size. He\u2019s stooped and twitchy. He blinks like a man trying to gain secondary employment as a human staple gun. He stumbles around like a toddler with a poo-y nappy. It is acting you can see from space. The whole performance seems designed to be cut together for a celebratory Oscars highlight reel, without realising that it all takes place within a horror movie directed by Fred Durst. The Travolta performance is what will draw the most attention to The Fanatic, but there are plenty of other grace notes if you look closely enough. Hunter Dunbar \u2013 the character, not the salesforce architect \u2013 is a Hollywood \u201caction hero\u201d who, if I\u2019ve got this right, is the star of a fictional film called Space Vampires. And, judging by the trailer, Hunter is also a celebrated author. At a signing, he sits in front of a poster for his autobiography that contains the quote \u201cA fascinating peek into the industry \u2013 Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, New York Times\u201d, leaving you convinced that three different newspapers gave the book an identical review. There\u2019s the shot of Hunter\u2019s award table, which contains what appear to be many novelty sex toys, each engraved with the words \u201cHunter Dunbar\u201d in the same font. There is, unless I am very much mistaken, a shot of a Hunter Dunbar voodoo doll carved out of butter. There\u2019s the ending, where Travolta staggers around with one of his eyes gouged out, possibly because he made the mistake of watching the rushes of his own film. If you\u2019d told me 20 years ago that John Travolta from The Thin Red Line would star in a film by Fred Durst from Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water, I would have told you to get out of of town. If you told me that now, I\u2019d still probably tell you to get out of town. But it happened, and The Fanatic exists, and wild horses couldn\u2019t stop me from watching it. The Fanatic is out in the US on 30 August with a UK date yet to be announced",

      "bodyText": "The next Thor film \u2013 which stars Natalie Portman as a female embodiment of the Marvel superhero \u2013 will be filmed in Sydney after a multimillion dollar grant from the Australian government. Director Taika Waititi and actors Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson are also set to return for the follow-up film to 2017\u2019s Thor: Ragnarok, which was filmed in Queensland. Thor: Love and Thunder \u2013 the fourth in the franchise \u2013 will now move south to Fox Studios in Sydney, with production to start in March 2020. Last week, Waititi explained that the new film will be based on an existing comic book storyline where Portman\u2019s character of Dr Jane Foster takes up the powers and hammer of Thor after he is stripped of his abilities. The New Zealand director clarified that the character\u2019s superhero moniker would be Mighty Thor. On Friday it was confirmed the franchise would build on Waititi and Hemsworth\u2019s antipodean links by returning to Australia. Thor: Ragnarok, which was Waititi\u2019s Marvel debut and also starred Cate Blanchett alongside compatriot Hemsworth, was the first in the series to film in Australia. It comes after another newly unveiled Marvel film, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, was also booked to film in Sydney. The two will now be filmed back to back. Australia\u2019s federal arts minister, Paul Fletcher, and his New South Wales counterpart, Don Harwin, said they had lured Marvel to Sydney with a $24m grant, and the project would create 2,500 jobs and invest $178m into the Australian economy. \u201cAustralia has an ongoing relationship with Marvel Studios and I\u2019m very pleased they will return to our shores again next year,\u201d Fletcher said. \u201cThis announcement means Marvel Studios will be producing films in Sydney for the next few years,\u201d added Harwin. Marvel would also offer a trainee program for Australian actors and crew as part of the deal. Speaking to reporters in Sydney, Hemsworth said it \u201cfantastic\u201d to make another film in Australia with Waititi, Thompson and Portman. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting feeling after [Avengers] Endgame because it was like where do you go from there?

      "body": "<p>On an overcast June afternoon in a Scarborough park, Biffy Clyro\u2019s tech team are road-testing a new stage rig. Jumbo plastic water bowsers that can be ingeniously lit from within have been stacked to create an imposing wall. The vibe is <a href=\"https://youtu.be/gi_6iiGofeY\" title=\"\">a cross between Tetris and disaster relief</a>, which seems appropriate. To the army of fans that have helped propel the Scottish trio from convulsive rock outsiders to reliable arena-fillers, Biffy are a band that could save your life.</p> <p>Backstage, frontman Simon Neil is in a dressing room dotted with signifiers of touring healthiness: bananas, Berocca, even a plant or two. After years of witnessing Neil and the Johnston twins, James (bass) and Ben (drums), invariably perform stripped to the waist, it is almost disconcerting to see him in a sweater. He is off-duty, but animated, keen to talk about Biffy\u2019s unexpected detour into film. \u201cNot to sound like a wanker,\u201d says the 39-year-old, \u201cbut I\u2019d love to make a movie some day.\u201d</p> <p>In May, the band surprise-released <a href=\"https://youtu.be/X9XR15E4vZw\" title=\"\">Balance, Not Symmetry</a>, an eclectic soundtrack album that zigzags between fire-breathing rock and delicate piano instrumentals. The film of the same name premiered at the Edinburgh film festival last month and will go on general release in August. A collaboration with the Welsh indie film-maker <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jamiedadams1?lang=en\" title=\"\">Jamie Adams</a>, it follows American student Caitlyn \u2013 played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/14/blackkklansman-review-spike-lee-adam-driver-cannes-2018\" title=\"\">BlacKkKlansman\u2019s</a> Laura Harrier \u2013 as she attempts to complete her final year at Glasgow School of Art while coping with the death of her father. It is emotionally raw, but often pleasingly dreamy, with sequences where the soundtrack takes over while characters pursue emotional or hedonistic release.</p> <p>Adams approached the band in July 2017 with the idea of building a film around a bespoke Biffy album. Neil, the core songwriter, was intrigued but initially sceptical. \u201cI didn\u2019t want it to just be someone who was like \u2018Can we use your name and fans?\u2019, not that we\u2019re Beyonc\u00e9 or anything,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want it to be a musical, I didn\u2019t want to name the characters in the songs. I wanted the record to be its own thing. It had to exist by itself, as the movie has to exist by itself, but equally feeding into each other.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"358beb9e0da3c450225cb2a112c8d7211dc5c3b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/358beb9e0da3c450225cb2a112c8d7211dc5c3b5/0_139_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bria Vinaite and Laura Harrier in Balance, Not Symmetry.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bria Vinaite and Laura Harrier in Balance, Not Symmetry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Being roughly the same age, Adams and Neil had some overlapping tastes in films and music, but also discovered they had both lost their mothers in their early 20s. Discussing how they had coped \u2013 or not \u2013 became the crux of the story. \u201cWe kind of bonded over that,\u201d says Neil, wryly. \u201cLots of fun conversations about grief.\u201d With hindsight, they realised their artistic outlets had helped them grapple with the severe emotional fallout. \u201cWe already had a channel for it, and that\u2019s why, in the film, Caitlyn is a painter \u2013 she has this sort of bond with her art, like I have with music and Jamie has with film. It was really important that we kept that. Because if I hadn\u2019t had music, I\u2019d be a completely different person. I would have grieved differently.\u201d</p> <p>Neil was also intrigued by Adams\u2019s naturalistic approach of encouraging actors to improvise in the moment while working from a general plot outline. \u201cWe did about a dozen brainstorming sessions on the phone,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d send Jamie a tune and he\u2019d feed back what he was feeling about the music.\u201d In the end, Neil shares a writing credit on the film, which surprised but delighted him after what had been an intense six months. \u201cEverything we work on, you\u2019ve got to commit fully and almost feel like you\u2019re drowning,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re struggling with it all and then you come up for air and it suddenly makes sense, and I felt like that\u2019s what Jamie was doing too.\u201d</p> <p>Rewind to October 2018 and the Balance, Not Symmetry shoot is in full swing. A cavernous Glasgow arts venue has been re-dressed as a lecture hall and filled with a crowd of young student extras, with stars Harrier and Bria Vinaite, the breakout star of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/09/the-florida-project-review-sean-baker-walt-disney-world\" title=\"\">The Florida Project</a>, discreetly tucked into a middle row. Usually, you might expect to find a director coordinating shots from a nearby video village, but as the art lecture unfolds, Adams stalks behind his roving lead cameraman as if they are a two-man Navy Seal team.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c_fjm9KLCM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3c_fjm9KLCM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Adams has been a thrifty and prolific maker of improvised comedies with female leads \u2013 including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/12/wild-honey-pie-review\" title=\"\">Wild Honey Pie!</a>, which starred Jemima Kirke, and Alright Now with sometime Shield agent Cobie Smulders \u2013 but Balance, Not Symmetry is a return to his more dramatic roots. \u201cWhen I started out, I was trying to be like [Federico] Fellini, trying to be incredibly artistic,\u201d he says during a break between set-ups. \u201cI was 27 and had just had my first child and my wife said: \u2018Can you perhaps make films that might sell, maybe? Ones that people might watch?\u2019 So that\u2019s what set me down the road of comedy.\u201d</p> <p>Ever since his teens, Adams had been toying with the idea of making a movie that reflected and channelled an album. It was just a case of finding the right artist. In the end, it was his brother, a musician, who steered him back toward Biffy, a band Adams had been overwhelmed by when he first saw them in 2003. \u201cI really loved their music and I could tell how it could be exciting to create a film with this really epic sound supporting it.

      "bodyText": "On an overcast June afternoon in a Scarborough park, Biffy Clyro\u2019s tech team are road-testing a new stage rig. Jumbo plastic water bowsers that can be ingeniously lit from within have been stacked to create an imposing wall. The vibe is a cross between Tetris and disaster relief, which seems appropriate. To the army of fans that have helped propel the Scottish trio from convulsive rock outsiders to reliable arena-fillers, Biffy are a band that could save your life. Backstage, frontman Simon Neil is in a dressing room dotted with signifiers of touring healthiness: bananas, Berocca, even a plant or two. After years of witnessing Neil and the Johnston twins, James (bass) and Ben (drums), invariably perform stripped to the waist, it is almost disconcerting to see him in a sweater. He is off-duty, but animated, keen to talk about Biffy\u2019s unexpected detour into film. \u201cNot to sound like a wanker,\u201d says the 39-year-old, \u201cbut I\u2019d love to make a movie some day.\u201d In May, the band surprise-released Balance, Not Symmetry, an eclectic soundtrack album that zigzags between fire-breathing rock and delicate piano instrumentals. The film of the same name premiered at the Edinburgh film festival last month and will go on general release in August. A collaboration with the Welsh indie film-maker Jamie Adams, it follows American student Caitlyn \u2013 played by BlacKkKlansman\u2019s Laura Harrier \u2013 as she attempts to complete her final year at Glasgow School of Art while coping with the death of her father. It is emotionally raw, but often pleasingly dreamy, with sequences where the soundtrack takes over while characters pursue emotional or hedonistic release. Adams approached the band in July 2017 with the idea of building a film around a bespoke Biffy album. Neil, the core songwriter, was intrigued but initially sceptical. \u201cI didn\u2019t want it to just be someone who was like \u2018Can we use your name and fans?\u2019, not that we\u2019re Beyonc\u00e9 or anything,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want it to be a musical, I didn\u2019t want to name the characters in the songs. I wanted the record to be its own thing. It had to exist by itself, as the movie has to exist by itself, but equally feeding into each other.\u201d Being roughly the same age, Adams and Neil had some overlapping tastes in films and music, but also discovered they had both lost their mothers in their early 20s. Discussing how they had coped \u2013 or not \u2013 became the crux of the story. \u201cWe kind of bonded over that,\u201d says Neil, wryly. \u201cLots of fun conversations about grief.\u201d With hindsight, they realised their artistic outlets had helped them grapple with the severe emotional fallout. \u201cWe already had a channel for it, and that\u2019s why, in the film, Caitlyn is a painter \u2013 she has this sort of bond with her art, like I have with music and Jamie has with film. It was really important that we kept that. Because if I hadn\u2019t had music, I\u2019d be a completely different person. I would have grieved differently.\u201d Neil was also intrigued by Adams\u2019s naturalistic approach of encouraging actors to improvise in the moment while working from a general plot outline. \u201cWe did about a dozen brainstorming sessions on the phone,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d send Jamie a tune and he\u2019d feed back what he was feeling about the music.\u201d In the end, Neil shares a writing credit on the film, which surprised but delighted him after what had been an intense six months. \u201cEverything we work on, you\u2019ve got to commit fully and almost feel like you\u2019re drowning,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re struggling with it all and then you come up for air and it suddenly makes sense, and I felt like that\u2019s what Jamie was doing too.\u201d Rewind to October 2018 and the Balance, Not Symmetry shoot is in full swing. A cavernous Glasgow arts venue has been re-dressed as a lecture hall and filled with a crowd of young student extras, with stars Harrier and Bria Vinaite, the breakout star of The Florida Project, discreetly tucked into a middle row. Usually, you might expect to find a director coordinating shots from a nearby video village, but as the art lecture unfolds, Adams stalks behind his roving lead cameraman as if they are a two-man Navy Seal team. Adams has been a thrifty and prolific maker of improvised comedies with female leads \u2013 including Wild Honey Pie!, which starred Jemima Kirke, and Alright Now with sometime Shield agent Cobie Smulders \u2013 but Balance, Not Symmetry is a return to his more dramatic roots. \u201cWhen I started out, I was trying to be like [Federico] Fellini, trying to be incredibly artistic,\u201d he says during a break between set-ups. \u201cI was 27 and had just had my first child and my wife said: \u2018Can you perhaps make films that might sell, maybe? Ones that people might watch?\u2019 So that\u2019s what set me down the road of comedy.\u201d Ever since his teens, Adams had been toying with the idea of making a movie that reflected and channelled an album. It was just a case of finding the right artist. In the end, it was his brother, a musician, who steered him back toward Biffy, a band Adams had been overwhelmed by when he first saw them in 2003. \u201cI really loved their music and I could tell how it could be exciting to create a film with this really epic sound supporting it. Then we started talking properly and the fact that Simon had lost his mum too \u2026 it was after that chat that we really worked out how the story was going to work.\u201d While the two are very different in tone, the conceptual touchstone was Quadrophenia, the Who\u2019s 1973 rock-opera double-album, which would eventually become a film six years later. \u201cThe idea was always that the album would come out first,\u201d says Adams. \u201cSo fans will have heard the songs and have their own feelings about them and they bring all that when they come and see this new interpretation.\u201d What was it like getting to hear essentially his own personalised Biffy Clyro album? Adams grins. \u201cIt was very exciting,\u201d he says, \u201cbut when Simon finally sent me all of the music it put a bit of pressure on because then I had to deliver my end of it. He\u2019s one of those people in life who you meet and say: \u2018Oh my God, to be like you would be incredible but also quite scary.\u2019 He can\u2019t control the fact that he\u2019s full of ideas and brilliance and energy.\u201d Back in Scarborough, Neil has just absent-mindedly used the word \u201cchuffed\u201d to describe his feelings about the film being finished and briefly cannot get over how Partridge-esque he sounds. \u201cChuffed? Chuffed!\u201d He shakes his head and resets. \u201cProud. I\u2019m proud.\u201d Divorced from the movie, the Balance, Not Symmetry soundtrack sounds even more expansive than the usual batty-and-broiling Biffy album. \u201cThe music is really eclectic because, in grief, you\u2019re not just sad for a bit then angry for a bit, you feel a dozen different things every day,\u201d says Neil. \u201cSome days you feel very accepting, and then later on you can feel like you just want to fucking end it.\u201d Neil also credits Adams for pushing him out of his habitual discomfort zone. \u201cAt one point, Jamie was saying to me: \u2018This scene needs to have the feeling of a climax of joy\u2019 and most of my songs have real sorrow in them, even the happiest ones, so I had to consciously be a bit more joyful.\u201d Thankfully, the recording sessions also had some lighter moments. \u201cIt was one of our most fun times in the studio, our producer Adam Noble really committed to it, working day and night \u2013 we were throwing everything at him, from a ukulele to recording footsteps to screaming through a megaphone.\u201d The title was originally intended for a book Neil was half-working on, a phrase that had been rattling round his brain for years. \u201cIt\u2019s been a kind of a mantra for me, I say it myself when things aren\u2019t going to plan,\u201d he says. \u201cThings are never going to be perfect, it\u2019s about finding balance.

James McAvoy looks like he could be a long-lost Johnston brother. \u201cMcAvoy\u2019s a good shout,\u201d says Neil. \u201cBut just get him to do what he did in Split and play all three of us.\u201d \u2022 Balance, Not Symmetry is released in selected cinemas on 1 August; screenings on 1 August feature a Biffy Clyro acoustic set and cast Q&amp;A",

      "body": "<p>There are not many shows that can lay claim to changing the television landscape during their lifetime, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/orange-is-the-new-black\">Orange Is the New Black</a> (Netflix) is one of them. It was the third series ever commissioned by Netflix, after House of Cards and the now-forgotten Hemlock Grove, and the first that made the most of the idea that an audience might be hungry to see representations of itself. Its stories crossed lines of class, race, sexuality and gender and mixed up comedy and drama to such an extent that it confused awards judges. It made stars of its huge cast, and set the template for the modern age of binge-watching. In 2013, when we realised we could watch 13 episodes in a weekend, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/jul/30/watching-orange-is-the-new-black\">OITNB</a> figured out how to pace its stories according to overindulgence, rather than the traditional weekly drop-in.</p> <p>It exits with this, its seventh and final season: easily the best and most self-assured since its debut. While OITNB was always ambitious, it occasionally tripped over its own shoelaces. It dedicated a whole season to a three-day prison riot, which was a bold idea whose execution collapsed into a mess of confusion. One of the main criticisms the show has faced is that it is too depressing. Its warm wit makes you love characters, but then the show does cruel, terrible things to them. Yes, it\u2019s about incarcerated women, so it was never likely to be a cuddly rainbow explosion, but it is also entertainment, not a documentary about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/21/orange-new-black-piper-kerman-eric-holder\">penal reform</a> \u2013 and there proved to be an upper limit to how much suffering viewers could manage. My moment came when Taystee took the fall for the riot, meaning one of the show\u2019s most beloved characters was dealt the blow of a life sentence without parole. After the earlier <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jul/04/samira-wiley-margaret-atwood-handmaids-tale-orange-new-black\">death of Poussey</a>, the show\u2019s other most beloved character, it was a horror too far.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"299e55e789e86d0c3e7527bbc2a7f40a54233e46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/299e55e789e86d0c3e7527bbc2a7f40a54233e46/193_382_4113_2468/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Danielle Brooks as Taystee in Orange Is the New Black.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beloved character \u2026 Danielle Brooks as Taystee in Orange Is the New Black.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicole Rivelli/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the balance has been restored, just about. Series seven still has moments of gloom so gut-wrenching it is difficult to watch, but they feel earned rather than punitive. Characters who have long been in need of a plot have finally been given something to do again. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/jul/30/watching-orange-is-the-new-black\">Piper, our original \u201cTrojan horse\u201d</a>, is out on probation, and becomes a walking demonstration of the labyrinthine bureaucracy that makes life difficult, if not impossible, for recently released prisoners. Once again, she survives it, but only because she can call in favours from the society she was born into. The outside world is not as kind to others, such as Black Cindy. The show has always been very good at illustrating the reach of white, wealthy privilege.</p> <p>The outside world looms large here. There is a clever, light #MeToo storyline that is brave in the way it hands out its sympathies, making it all the more probing and thoughtful. Litchfield now has an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/23/immigration-detention-centers-nearly-empty-as-trump-claims-border-crisis\">immigration detention centre</a> attached to it, and if Piper thinks she\u2019s struggling in a tangle of barmy regulations, it has nothing on the sheer insanity of the mass detentions and deportations, which make a tidy profit for the corporation running the ship. (The show\u2019s anticapitalist streak has always been fun.) Phone calls must be paid for, but there is no money. The prisoners can\u2019t talk to their children, because they don\u2019t always know where their children are. They are thrown a lifeline in the form of Gloria and Red, who run the kitchen, and set up an underground legal network, one of the main threads that ties the season together.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiB1iv8DQcg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AiB1iv8DQcg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiB1iv8DQcg\">Watch a trailer for series 7</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The show mostly resists the temptation to say goodbye with a greatest hits tour, but it certainly gets the band playing some familiar tunes. It will be hard to find any fan with a complaint, given that all the favourites, and some surprises, get at least a little screen time, especially in the final episode. Even the chickens make a comeback. Not all of it works \u2013 Daya\u2019s evolution into ice-cold top dog is cartoonish, for example \u2013 but it never lacks heart. The season really belongs to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/oct/01/danielle-brooks-orange-new-black-color-purple-broadway-diversity-stereotypes\">Taystee</a>, who is struggling with the injustice of her sentence and the Sisyphean task of fighting it, and to Pennsatucky, trying to make something of her life inside.</p> <p>But for all of its crowdpleasing, its message is ultimately one of futility. There are small victories, and occasional triumphs, but mostly, the wheels just keep on turning the same way they always did. It is a bittersweet note to end on, but it is utterly true to itself, and Orange Is the New Black has always been that.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There are not many shows that can lay claim to changing the television landscape during their lifetime, but Orange Is the New Black (Netflix) is one of them. It was the third series ever commissioned by Netflix, after House of Cards and the now-forgotten Hemlock Grove, and the first that made the most of the idea that an audience might be hungry to see representations of itself. Its stories crossed lines of class, race, sexuality and gender and mixed up comedy and drama to such an extent that it confused awards judges. It made stars of its huge cast, and set the template for the modern age of binge-watching. In 2013, when we realised we could watch 13 episodes in a weekend, OITNB figured out how to pace its stories according to overindulgence, rather than the traditional weekly drop-in. It exits with this, its seventh and final season: easily the best and most self-assured since its debut. While OITNB was always ambitious, it occasionally tripped over its own shoelaces. It dedicated a whole season to a three-day prison riot, which was a bold idea whose execution collapsed into a mess of confusion. One of the main criticisms the show has faced is that it is too depressing. Its warm wit makes you love characters, but then the show does cruel, terrible things to them. Yes, it\u2019s about incarcerated women, so it was never likely to be a cuddly rainbow explosion, but it is also entertainment, not a documentary about penal reform \u2013 and there proved to be an upper limit to how much suffering viewers could manage. My moment came when Taystee took the fall for the riot, meaning one of the show\u2019s most beloved characters was dealt the blow of a life sentence without parole. After the earlier death of Poussey, the show\u2019s other most beloved character, it was a horror too far. But the balance has been restored, just about. Series seven still has moments of gloom so gut-wrenching it is difficult to watch, but they feel earned rather than punitive. Characters who have long been in need of a plot have finally been given something to do again. Piper, our original \u201cTrojan horse\u201d, is out on probation, and becomes a walking demonstration of the labyrinthine bureaucracy that makes life difficult, if not impossible, for recently released prisoners. Once again, she survives it, but only because she can call in favours from the society she was born into. The outside world is not as kind to others, such as Black Cindy. The show has always been very good at illustrating the reach of white, wealthy privilege. The outside world looms large here. There is a clever, light #MeToo storyline that is brave in the way it hands out its sympathies, making it all the more probing and thoughtful. Litchfield now has an immigration detention centre attached to it, and if Piper thinks she\u2019s struggling in a tangle of barmy regulations, it has nothing on the sheer insanity of the mass detentions and deportations, which make a tidy profit for the corporation running the ship. (The show\u2019s anticapitalist streak has always been fun.) Phone calls must be paid for, but there is no money. The prisoners can\u2019t talk to their children, because they don\u2019t always know where their children are. They are thrown a lifeline in the form of Gloria and Red, who run the kitchen, and set up an underground legal network, one of the main threads that ties the season together. The show mostly resists the temptation to say goodbye with a greatest hits tour, but it certainly gets the band playing some familiar tunes. It will be hard to find any fan with a complaint, given that all the favourites, and some surprises, get at least a little screen time, especially in the final episode. Even the chickens make a comeback. Not all of it works \u2013 Daya\u2019s evolution into ice-cold top dog is cartoonish, for example \u2013 but it never lacks heart. The season really belongs to Taystee, who is struggling with the injustice of her sentence and the Sisyphean task of fighting it, and to Pennsatucky, trying to make something of her life inside. But for all of its crowdpleasing, its message is ultimately one of futility. There are small victories, and occasional triumphs, but mostly, the wheels just keep on turning the same way they always did. It is a bittersweet note to end on, but it is utterly true to itself, and Orange Is the New Black has always been that.",

      "body": "<p>Matthew Macfadyen was idling on the stoop of his boutique Manhattan hotel last month when a man walked past and said warmly: \u201cI loved you in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/mar/18/billions-the-smartest-stupid-show-on-tv-damian-lewis-paul-giamatti\" title=\"\">Billions</a>.\u201d Macfadyen, at 44, is one of the handful of male British actors on US TV \u2013 among them Benedict Cumberbatch, Dominic West and the actor for whom Macfadyen was mistaken, Damian Lewis \u2013 whom to American eyes can appear indistinguishable. \u201cThank you!\u201d he replied, cheerfully. (Macfadyen is extremely polite, and inclined to be grateful for any recognition at all.) \u201cThen he came back two minutes later and said: \u2018<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/dec/14/the-50-best-tv-shows-of-2018-no-5-succession\" title=\"\">Succession</a>! So sorry.\u2019\u201d He roars with laughter.</p> <p>Tom Wambsgans, the role Macfadyen plays in Succession, is robustly against type. In the 14 years since he played Darcy to Keira Knightley\u2019s Elizabeth Bennett in <a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/pride-and-prejudice-2005\" title=\"\">Pride and Prejudice</a>, Macfadyen\u2019s career has leaned heavily towards period drama. He did <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/05/anna-karenina-review-keira-knightley\" title=\"\">Anna Karenina</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2009/sep/21/emmy-awards-little-dorrit-30-rock-mad-men\" title=\"\">Little Dorrit</a>. When the pilot script for Succession reached him, he had just played Mr Wilcox in the BBC adaptation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/12/howards-end-review-timely-careful-remake-class-race\" title=\"\">Howards End</a>. Tom, the ambitious, oleaginous husband to an Elisabeth Murdoch-type heiress was as far from these foppish roles as Macfadyen could get, a gift even before the show took off. \u201cI thought: \u2018I don\u2019t know if this is going to have a life and I don\u2019t know where the characters are going to go. But it\u2019s clever and farcically funny.\u2019\u201d At the very least, he thought, \u201cit\u2019ll show I can do an American accent\u201d.</p> <p>In the event, Succession was one of the breakout hits of last year; a smart, funny, compulsively watchable drama about Logan Roy, an ailing media plutocrat, played by Brian Cox, and his furiously competing adult children. It was created by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jul/29/succession-comedy-drama-tv-media-barons-jesse-armstrong\" title=\"\">Jesse Armstrong</a>, of Peep Show and The Thick of It, and combined the feel of a stately, prestige HBO show with the savage compound-swearing that is recognisable to anyone who loves Armstrong\u2019s work. \u201cIt\u2019s very caustic,\u201d says Macfadyen, \u201cwhich you recognise as a Brit.\u201d In spite of the show\u2019s American characters and setting, he is right when he says \u201cthere\u2019s a British sensibility to it\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ed0166dfb274b3b0a851b3e393e9ff0f8d023eae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed0166dfb274b3b0a851b3e393e9ff0f8d023eae/113_0_4527_2716/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Macfadyen with Sarah Snook in Succession\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Macfadyen with Sarah Snook in Succession.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We are in a restaurant in midtown Manhattan during the last days of Macfadyen\u2019s three-month stint filming the show\u2019s second season. At the end of the week, he is due to fly to Croatia to film episode 10 and then home to London to his family: his wife, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/feb/17/keeley-hawes-we-all-need-to-be-more-positive-thriller-suspense-traitors\" title=\"\">Keeley Hawes</a>, and their two children, Maggie and Ralph. The last time I saw Macfadyen, he was in New York filming season one of Succession and Hawes was in the UK riding out the fuss around her BBC drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/dec/18/best-tv-shows-2018-bodyguard\" title=\"\">Bodyguard</a>. Now, with Macfadyen\u2019s success in the US \u2013 albeit more muted than British hysteria around Bodyguard \u2013 their positions are reversed.</p> <p>\u201cIt was peculiar,\u201d he says, of the fuss surrounding his wife\u2019s show. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/04/richard-madden-bodyguard-rocketman-bullies-inner-fat-lad-miranda-sawyer\" title=\"\">Richard Madden</a> couldn\u2019t leave his house! There was a WhatsApp group in his street, with friends saying: \u2018It\u2019s bad today, stay in.\u2019 It was really bonkers.\u201d</p> <p>Succession is a vastly superior show and, along with the other actors, Macfadyen is excellent in it. As Tom, he plays a man of staggering venality and weakness who is nonetheless not wholly a monster. \u201cWhile on one level, they are all revolting and the rest of it, they\u2019re not amoral,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re doing their best with what they\u2019ve got. And it\u2019s a family, so instantly you\u2019ve got a hook.\u201d The occasionally ludicrous lengths to which characters go to achieve their aims are no more ludicrous, says Macfadyen, than real life. \u201cJust look at what\u2019s going on in the world now \u2013 people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/02/brexit-party-meps-turn-their-backs-european-anthem-ode-to-joy\" title=\"\">turning their backs in the European parliament</a>. If they put that in a show, you wouldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p> <p>Tom, he agrees, is \u201cdreadful. Excruciating. And joyful to play because he\u2019s so particular. I\u2019m flexing a muscle that I haven\u2019t flexed for a bit. We laugh a lot, me and Nick Braun who plays Greg [Logan Roy\u2019s pathetic grandnephew and the only person lower in the family food chain than Tom]. It\u2019s exquisite.\u201d</p> <p>And yet, he says: \u201cTom\u2019s quite sweet in some ways. He really does love [his screen wife] Shiv. And they have reached an arrangement about their modern, polygamous marriage, which he is manfully going along with. I think he\u2019d really like to, you know, just go and be a ski instructor or open a hotel in the west.\u201d</p> <p>In spite of almost 20 years of solid visibility on UK screens, Macfadyen is unfailingly modest about his achievements. You do something good and then you wait, he says, and often nothing of value comes along. \u201cI felt like I was treading water a little bit in the UK just before Howards End. I\u2019d done a show called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/oct/14/ripper-street-a-ridiculously-underrated-victorian-thriller\" title=\"\">Ripper Street</a>, in which I was a Victorian copper, which was lovely. But there were certain things I didn\u2019t want to do after that; I didn\u2019t want to do an ITV drama, or thriller. That sounds snobbish, but you know what I mean. So you wait for a play or a movie.\u201d</p> <p>One of the projects he said yes to was a movie with Benedict Cumberbatch called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/sep/10/the-current-war-review-benedict-cumberbatch-edison-toronto-film-festival-2017-tiff\" title=\"\">The Current War</a>, the story of Thomas Edison\u2019s race with George Westinghouse to \u201cput a star in a jar\u201d as Edison puts it in the movie, and be the first to provide the US with electricity. Macfadyen plays JP Morgan, who financed both men. It is a small, but satisfying, role in a gripping and beautifully shot movie that also tackles Edison\u2019s grief at the loss of his wife. Watching the movie, you are struck by a sense of precedent: that, 100 years from now, similar projects will be made about the race to own the internet.</p> <p>Macfadyen has yet to see the result. \u201cDoes it work?\u201d he says keenly. \u201cIs it interesting? It\u2019s quite a dry subject, if I\u2019m honest.\u201d He bursts out laughing. In fact, it does work and is oddly moving. The film is beautifully directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, and co-stars Nicholas Hoult as Nikola Tesla, the eccentric third participant in the race, who memorably died broke and alone in a hotel room in New York. Macfadyen is suitably pompous as Morgan, and Cumberbatch plays the kind of twitchy, mercurial character he has come to specialise in \u2013 his performance as Edison is recognisably in the vein of Sherlock and Patrick Melrose.</p> <p>The story of the race to invent electricity was never going to break box office records, but, for Macfadyen, it came down to finding interest in that particular period of history and the chance to work with a terrific team.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2be2a24dc021ab9d18ace7a74f8a8681a5030ccb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2be2a24dc021ab9d18ace7a74f8a8681a5030ccb/78_0_3295_1977/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Macfadyen, with MyAnna Buring, in Ripper Street\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Macfadyen, with MyAnna Buring, in Ripper Street.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI thought the script was good. I thought it would be fun \u2013 nice, prestigious, and with great people.\u201d And JP Morgan was an interesting character. \u201cHe had this enormous bulbous nose, and wouldn\u2019t let anyone photograph him. And he bailed out the economy, apparently. His house in London was kept staffed, and they made him a full breakfast every morning, in case he arrived unexpectedly. Then every morning, they cleared it away.\u201d</p> <p>Other movies in the pipeline are a cameo in <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/04/harvey-weinstein-assistant-movie-matthew-macfadyen-kristine-froseth-makenzie-leigh-kitty-green-1202591047/\" title=\"\">The Assistant</a>, a film based on a Harvey Weinstein-type character. \u201cIt\u2019s not pointed out that it\u2019s Weinstein, but it\u2019s obviously set in the bad old days of Miramax. I had one day\u2019s work as head of HR, and it was great. Good fun. I mean, not good fun; but a really clever script. Because all [the abuse] is in increments. What\u2019s awful about it is how banal it is. There is no point where you can have anyone up for anything.\u201d</p> <p>Last time we met, Macfadyen had talked about the disparity between his and his wife\u2019s experiences of the movie industry, from the fact \u201cthere are just less parts for women, and there\u2019s also a weird thing with women where you\u2019re the ingenue, and then there\u2019s a wasteland, and then you\u2019re Hedda Gabler\u201d, to the fact that \u201cmen are, by and large, paid more than women. I know this from Keeley \u2013 that the sort of excuse they\u2019ll use is: \u2018Well he\u2019s done a few American things.\u2019 And you think, well, no. It\u2019s not to do with that. It\u2019s cobblers.\u201d</p> <p>He never had direct experience of Weinstein himself. But he and Hawes intuitively resisted moving to Los Angeles and immersing themselves more fully in Hollywood. \u201cIt didn\u2019t seem like somewhere we wanted to live,\u201d he says. The family came out to visit him in New York in half-term, but this time the novelty had worn off. \u201cI\u2019ve found it quite tough, this time, being away,\u201d he says. \u201cPartly because I haven\u2019t gotten back as much as I did last time, but also I\u2019ve done all the walks; I don\u2019t need to buy any more jeans. And if I have more than three of four days off and I can\u2019t get back, I miss the kids.\u201d</p> <p>The virtue of doing a series such as Succession is that there is a six-month break between seasons, during which time it\u2019s conventional for actors to knock themselves out doing movie work or hustling for other high-profile projects. But after finishing season one of Succession, Macfadyen thought: sod it. \u201cKeeley found herself busy in a bonkers way, and we had building work, and I just took the kids away. It was amazing. I took them to France for the whole summer. Maggie\u2019s almost 15, and I was thinking: \u2018She\u2019s not going to put up with this for much longer,\u2019 so we went and it was just heaven. Nothing was coming in for me and I thought: \u2018Oh, fuck it, I\u2019m just going to go.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"37e352c8bb4dbf9662007b215e785de11bf92d21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37e352c8bb4dbf9662007b215e785de11bf92d21/478_192_2475_1484/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Macfadyen in The Current War.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Macfadyen as JP Morgan in The Current War.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dean Rogers</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In some ways, that kind of concentrated time with kids may be better than snatched hours at the end of the day. \u201cThat\u2019s what I say to myself when I spend weeks away and start to think: \u2018Oh, God.\u2019 But that summer was magic. And the rest of this year Keeley\u2019s busy and I\u2019ll be able to be there again. Being on their nerves.\u201d</p> <p>Season two of the show feels even more timely than the first. These days, the dysfunctional Roy family puts you less in mind of the Murdochs than the Trumps. \u201cThere\u2019s an absence of love, somewhere. And it all comes from daddy. They can\u2019t really, truly, have any proper confidence in themselves even though they\u2019re stuffed full of cash and can do anything.\u201d Yes, if you\u2019re raised by a narcissist, it\u2019s no wonder you turn out like Ivanka. \u201cOr those boys! Jesus Christ.\u201d</p> <p>The news depresses him. \u201cI don\u2019t know where to put my frustration. I get into a ball of fury about it, and then I don\u2019t know what to do with it. Someone said to me the other day, why aren\u2019t people protesting in the streets about the children at the border? People sort of shrug and say: \u2018What can you do?\u2019 You feel powerless. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/05/donald-trump-dictator-not-enough-laugh\" title=\"\">There was a brilliant article by Jonathan Freedland about how Trump wants to be a dictator</a>.

He laughs. \u201cKeeley was saying something like this the other day: what about finding a house in wherever? You need a well.\u201d</p> <p>The best thing about filming Succession, says Macfadyen, is that it\u2019s an ensemble piece and, for all its prestige, this takes the pressure off each individual actor. \u201cThere\u2019s a lovely feeling on set of it being like a play. We do these scenes, and it\u2019s curiously relaxing. Like with The Current War, you\u2019re [the only one on camera] with your fake moustache, and it\u2019s terrifying. It\u2019s just you, doing one line. It\u2019s much less frightening doing an eight-page scene with all these people in Succession because you have to pay attention to the other person. So you forget yourself. And then it gives you its own energy. Five pages in one take, ninja camera operators so that you never know if you\u2019re going to be on or if they\u2019re going to find you. It\u2019s exciting.\u201d</p> <p>Macfadyen\u2019s levity communicates the refreshing perspective that acting is really quite silly. Still, he says, when something is good it raises everyone up. \u201cI really think that. I went to see Andrew Scott doing Hamlet a while ago, and I felt proud to be an actor. It was a great production. And it was a beautiful performance, not the terrible idiocy that it sometimes seems, but\u201d \u2013 he looks surprised by his own conclusion \u2013 \u201cthrilling.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Current War is out in the UK on Friday 26 July</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Matthew Macfadyen was idling on the stoop of his boutique Manhattan hotel last month when a man walked past and said warmly: \u201cI loved you in Billions.\u201d Macfadyen, at 44, is one of the handful of male British actors on US TV \u2013 among them Benedict Cumberbatch, Dominic West and the actor for whom Macfadyen was mistaken, Damian Lewis \u2013 whom to American eyes can appear indistinguishable. \u201cThank you!\u201d he replied, cheerfully. (Macfadyen is extremely polite, and inclined to be grateful for any recognition at all.) \u201cThen he came back two minutes later and said: \u2018Succession! So sorry.\u2019\u201d He roars with laughter. Tom Wambsgans, the role Macfadyen plays in Succession, is robustly against type. In the 14 years since he played Darcy to Keira Knightley\u2019s Elizabeth Bennett in Pride and Prejudice, Macfadyen\u2019s career has leaned heavily towards period drama. He did Anna Karenina and Little Dorrit. When the pilot script for Succession reached him, he had just played Mr Wilcox in the BBC adaptation of Howards End. Tom, the ambitious, oleaginous husband to an Elisabeth Murdoch-type heiress was as far from these foppish roles as Macfadyen could get, a gift even before the show took off. \u201cI thought: \u2018I don\u2019t know if this is going to have a life and I don\u2019t know where the characters are going to go. But it\u2019s clever and farcically funny.\u2019\u201d At the very least, he thought, \u201cit\u2019ll show I can do an American accent\u201d. In the event, Succession was one of the breakout hits of last year; a smart, funny, compulsively watchable drama about Logan Roy, an ailing media plutocrat, played by Brian Cox, and his furiously competing adult children. It was created by Jesse Armstrong, of Peep Show and The Thick of It, and combined the feel of a stately, prestige HBO show with the savage compound-swearing that is recognisable to anyone who loves Armstrong\u2019s work. \u201cIt\u2019s very caustic,\u201d says Macfadyen, \u201cwhich you recognise as a Brit.\u201d In spite of the show\u2019s American characters and setting, he is right when he says \u201cthere\u2019s a British sensibility to it\u201d. We are in a restaurant in midtown Manhattan during the last days of Macfadyen\u2019s three-month stint filming the show\u2019s second season. At the end of the week, he is due to fly to Croatia to film episode 10 and then home to London to his family: his wife, Keeley Hawes, and their two children, Maggie and Ralph. The last time I saw Macfadyen, he was in New York filming season one of Succession and Hawes was in the UK riding out the fuss around her BBC drama Bodyguard. Now, with Macfadyen\u2019s success in the US \u2013 albeit more muted than British hysteria around Bodyguard \u2013 their positions are reversed. \u201cIt was peculiar,\u201d he says, of the fuss surrounding his wife\u2019s show. \u201cRichard Madden couldn\u2019t leave his house! There was a WhatsApp group in his street, with friends saying: \u2018It\u2019s bad today, stay in.\u2019 It was really bonkers.\u201d Succession is a vastly superior show and, along with the other actors, Macfadyen is excellent in it. As Tom, he plays a man of staggering venality and weakness who is nonetheless not wholly a monster. \u201cWhile on one level, they are all revolting and the rest of it, they\u2019re not amoral,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re doing their best with what they\u2019ve got. And it\u2019s a family, so instantly you\u2019ve got a hook.\u201d The occasionally ludicrous lengths to which characters go to achieve their aims are no more ludicrous, says Macfadyen, than real life. \u201cJust look at what\u2019s going on in the world now \u2013 people turning their backs in the European parliament. If they put that in a show, you wouldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d Tom, he agrees, is \u201cdreadful. Excruciating. And joyful to play because he\u2019s so particular. I\u2019m flexing a muscle that I haven\u2019t flexed for a bit. We laugh a lot, me and Nick Braun who plays Greg [Logan Roy\u2019s pathetic grandnephew and the only person lower in the family food chain than Tom]. It\u2019s exquisite.\u201d And yet, he says: \u201cTom\u2019s quite sweet in some ways. He really does love [his screen wife] Shiv. And they have reached an arrangement about their modern, polygamous marriage, which he is manfully going along with. I think he\u2019d really like to, you know, just go and be a ski instructor or open a hotel in the west.\u201d In spite of almost 20 years of solid visibility on UK screens, Macfadyen is unfailingly modest about his achievements. You do something good and then you wait, he says, and often nothing of value comes along. \u201cI felt like I was treading water a little bit in the UK just before Howards End. I\u2019d done a show called Ripper Street, in which I was a Victorian copper, which was lovely. But there were certain things I didn\u2019t want to do after that; I didn\u2019t want to do an ITV drama, or thriller. That sounds snobbish, but you know what I mean. So you wait for a play or a movie.\u201d One of the projects he said yes to was a movie with Benedict Cumberbatch called The Current War, the story of Thomas Edison\u2019s race with George Westinghouse to \u201cput a star in a jar\u201d as Edison puts it in the movie, and be the first to provide the US with electricity. Macfadyen plays JP Morgan, who financed both men. It is a small, but satisfying, role in a gripping and beautifully shot movie that also tackles Edison\u2019s grief at the loss of his wife. Watching the movie, you are struck by a sense of precedent: that, 100 years from now, similar projects will be made about the race to own the internet. Macfadyen has yet to see the result. \u201cDoes it work?\u201d he says keenly. \u201cIs it interesting? It\u2019s quite a dry subject, if I\u2019m honest.\u201d He bursts out laughing. In fact, it does work and is oddly moving. The film is beautifully directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, and co-stars Nicholas Hoult as Nikola Tesla, the eccentric third participant in the race, who memorably died broke and alone in a hotel room in New York. Macfadyen is suitably pompous as Morgan, and Cumberbatch plays the kind of twitchy, mercurial character he has come to specialise in \u2013 his performance as Edison is recognisably in the vein of Sherlock and Patrick Melrose. The story of the race to invent electricity was never going to break box office records, but, for Macfadyen, it came down to finding interest in that particular period of history and the chance to work with a terrific team. \u201cI thought the script was good. I thought it would be fun \u2013 nice, prestigious, and with great people.\u201d And JP Morgan was an interesting character. \u201cHe had this enormous bulbous nose, and wouldn\u2019t let anyone photograph him. And he bailed out the economy, apparently. His house in London was kept staffed, and they made him a full breakfast every morning, in case he arrived unexpectedly. Then every morning, they cleared it away.\u201d Other movies in the pipeline are a cameo in The Assistant, a film based on a Harvey Weinstein-type character. \u201cIt\u2019s not pointed out that it\u2019s Weinstein, but it\u2019s obviously set in the bad old days of Miramax. I had one day\u2019s work as head of HR, and it was great. Good fun. I mean, not good fun; but a really clever script. Because all [the abuse] is in increments. What\u2019s awful about it is how banal it is. There is no point where you can have anyone up for anything.\u201d Last time we met, Macfadyen had talked about the disparity between his and his wife\u2019s experiences of the movie industry, from the fact \u201cthere are just less parts for women, and there\u2019s also a weird thing with women where you\u2019re the ingenue, and then there\u2019s a wasteland, and then you\u2019re Hedda Gabler\u201d, to the fact that \u201cmen are, by and large, paid more than women. I know this from Keeley \u2013 that the sort of excuse they\u2019ll use is: \u2018Well he\u2019s done a few American things.\u2019 And you think, well, no. It\u2019s not to do with that. It\u2019s cobblers.\u201d He never had direct experience of Weinstein himself. But he and Hawes intuitively resisted moving to Los Angeles and immersing themselves more fully in Hollywood. \u201cIt didn\u2019t seem like somewhere we wanted to live,\u201d he says. The family came out to visit him in New York in half-term, but this time the novelty had worn off. \u201cI\u2019ve found it quite tough, this time, being away,\u201d he says. \u201cPartly because I haven\u2019t gotten back as much as I did last time, but also I\u2019ve done all the walks; I don\u2019t need to buy any more jeans. And if I have more than three of four days off and I can\u2019t get back, I miss the kids.\u201d The virtue of doing a series such as Succession is that there is a six-month break between seasons, during which time it\u2019s conventional for actors to knock themselves out doing movie work or hustling for other high-profile projects. But after finishing season one of Succession, Macfadyen thought: sod it. \u201cKeeley found herself busy in a bonkers way, and we had building work, and I just took the kids away. It was amazing. I took them to France for the whole summer. Maggie\u2019s almost 15, and I was thinking: \u2018She\u2019s not going to put up with this for much longer,\u2019 so we went and it was just heaven. Nothing was coming in for me and I thought: \u2018Oh, fuck it, I\u2019m just going to go.\u2019\u201d In some ways, that kind of concentrated time with kids may be better than snatched hours at the end of the day. \u201cThat\u2019s what I say to myself when I spend weeks away and start to think: \u2018Oh, God.\u2019 But that summer was magic. And the rest of this year Keeley\u2019s busy and I\u2019ll be able to be there again. Being on their nerves.\u201d Season two of the show feels even more timely than the first. These days, the dysfunctional Roy family puts you less in mind of the Murdochs than the Trumps. \u201cThere\u2019s an absence of love, somewhere. And it all comes from daddy. They can\u2019t really, truly, have any proper confidence in themselves even though they\u2019re stuffed full of cash and can do anything.\u201d Yes, if you\u2019re raised by a narcissist, it\u2019s no wonder you turn out like Ivanka. \u201cOr those boys! Jesus Christ.\u201d The news depresses him. \u201cI don\u2019t know where to put my frustration. I get into a ball of fury about it, and then I don\u2019t know what to do with it. Someone said to me the other day, why aren\u2019t people protesting in the streets about the children at the border? People sort of shrug and say: \u2018What can you do?\u2019 You feel powerless. There was a brilliant article by Jonathan Freedland about how Trump wants to be a dictator. And then you shrug and think: \u2018Oh, it\u2019ll be all right.\u2019\u201d He looks stricken. \u201cSame with climate change. You know, \u2018Someone will build a shield.\u2019 Or, \u2018Yeah, we\u2019ll seed clouds in the sky.\u201d Time to buy a house in Duluth, I suggest. He laughs. \u201cKeeley was saying something like this the other day: what about finding a house in wherever? You need a well.\u201d The best thing about filming Succession, says Macfadyen, is that it\u2019s an ensemble piece and, for all its prestige, this takes the pressure off each individual actor. \u201cThere\u2019s a lovely feeling on set of it being like a play. We do these scenes, and it\u2019s curiously relaxing. Like with The Current War, you\u2019re [the only one on camera] with your fake moustache, and it\u2019s terrifying. It\u2019s just you, doing one line. It\u2019s much less frightening doing an eight-page scene with all these people in Succession because you have to pay attention to the other person. So you forget yourself. And then it gives you its own energy. Five pages in one take, ninja camera operators so that you never know if you\u2019re going to be on or if they\u2019re going to find you. It\u2019s exciting.\u201d Macfadyen\u2019s levity communicates the refreshing perspective that acting is really quite silly. Still, he says, when something is good it raises everyone up. \u201cI really think that. I went to see Andrew Scott doing Hamlet a while ago, and I felt proud to be an actor. It was a great production. And it was a beautiful performance, not the terrible idiocy that it sometimes seems, but\u201d \u2013 he looks surprised by his own conclusion \u2013 \u201cthrilling.\u201d \u2022 The Current War is out in the UK on Friday 26 July",

The choice is to make baby boomers pay for their own care or tell the asset-poor younger generation that they will have to pay for Granny and Grandad\u2019s care through higher taxation. To sum up, Britain has a trade deficit problem, a London versus-the-rest problem, a debt problem, a housing problem and a care problem. The fact that Johnson has referenced some of them already indicates that he knows that they are there. All of them predate the EU referendum, gigantic wake-up call though that was. May realised that it was impossible to pretend that the Brexit vote hadn\u2019t happened, and promised to get Britain out of the EU while tackling the \u201cburning injustices\u201d which led to the leave vote. She did neither. In part, that was because attempting to deliver Brexit left no time to do anything else; in part, because structural economic problems required a complete rebooting rather than May\u2019s tinkering. Johnson wants to quicken the pace, making it clear that he intends to be tougher than May on Brexit and tougher than May on the causes of Brexit. Voters in Conservative-Labour marginals are his target. There is a paradox, though, in a cabinet that includes Thatcherite true believers such as Sajid Javid and Liz Truss boasting that it is qualified to deal with the economic distress which was such a big factor in the referendum result. The causes of Brexit lie not in leftwing economic policies but in Thatcher\u2019s scorched-earth wipeout of manufacturing in the 1980s and the austerity that targeted the weak and vulnerable after 2010. Being tough on the causes of Brexit means changing the culture of business so that it boosts investment. It means rethinking the role of the state so that Britain leads rather than follows in the fourth industrial revolution. It means spending more on infrastructure, especially in the north. It means a mass housebuilding programme. Put simply, it means doing stuff not normally associated with politicians who think the free market is always right. \u2022 Larry Elliott is the Guardian\u2019s economics editor",

But I won\u2019t be sipping it, or even letting any seep beneath my neoprene collar. I\u2019m chest deep in the water, walking the 15 metres (49 feet) of Rochdale canal where it bisects Manchester city centre, flanked by police divers Steve and Jags, searching methodically for anything of significance. Today we find no more than a black Marks &amp; Spencer stiletto, some fencing, a tyre, an umbrella, a cardigan and a couple of chairs that the canalside Rain Bar would probably like back. But the bread and butter for these divers from the north-west police underwater search and marine unit is finding bodies. This is the stretch of canal where, less than 18 months ago, 19-year old Charlie Pope fell to his death. The pathologist at the inquest said that on entering the icy water that March morning the student would probably have survived only a matter of minutes before cardiac arrest. It\u2019s also where, three months later, the underwater search team recovered the body of 19-year-old student Orlando Nyero.

Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage, Donald Trump, Narendra Modi, Jair Bolsonaro, Scott Morrison, Rodrigo Duterte, Matteo Salvini, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, Viktor Orb\u00e1n and a host of other ludicrous strongmen \u2013 or weakmen, as they so often turn out to be \u2013 dominate nations that would once have laughed them off stage. The question is why? Why are the technocrats who held sway almost everywhere a few years ago giving way to extravagant buffoons?</p> \n<p>Social media, an incubator of absurdity, is certainly part of the story. But while there has been plenty of good work investigating the means, there has been surprisingly little thinking about the ends. Why are the ultra-rich, who until recently used their money and newspapers to promote charisma-free politicians, now funding this circus? Why would capital wish to be represented by middle managers one moment and jesters the next?</p> \n<p>The reason, I believe, is that the nature of capitalism has changed. The dominant force of the 1990s and early 2000s \u2013 corporate power \u2013 demanded technocratic government. It wanted people who could simultaneously run a competent, secure state and protect profits from democratic change. In 2012, when Bremner made his complaint, power was already shifting to a different place, but politics had not caught up.</p> \n<p>The policies that were supposed to promote enterprise \u2013 slashing taxes for the rich, ripping down public protections, destroying trade unions \u2013 instead stimulated a powerful spiral of <a href=\"http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674979857\" title=\"\">patrimonial wealth accumulation</a>. The largest fortunes are now made not through entrepreneurial brilliance but through inheritance, monopoly and rent-seeking: securing exclusive control of crucial assets such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/17/housing-britain-landlord-tenants\" title=\"\">land and buildings</a> privatised utilities and intellectual property, and assembling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/09/elizabeth-warren-break-up-facebook-google-amazon\" title=\"\">service monopolies</a> such as trading hubs, software and social media platforms, then charging user fees far higher than the costs of production and delivery. In Russia, people who enrich themselves this way are called oligarchs. But this is a global phenomenon. Today corporate power is overlain by \u2013 and mutating into \u2013 oligarchic power.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d13f5435-d991-4408-9b16-49236f7bdce9\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gcEVvMPC088?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>What the oligarchs want is not the same as what the old corporations wanted.

      "bodyText": "Seven years ago the impressionist Rory Bremner complained that politicians had become so boring that few of them were worth mimicking: \u201cThey\u2019re quite homogenous and dull these days \u2026 It\u2019s as if character is seen as a liability.\u201d Today his profession has the opposite problem: however extreme satire becomes, it struggles to keep pace with reality. The political sphere, so dull and grey a few years ago, is now populated by preposterous exhibitionists. This trend is not confined to the UK \u2013 everywhere the killer clowns are taking over. Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage, Donald Trump, Narendra Modi, Jair Bolsonaro, Scott Morrison, Rodrigo Duterte, Matteo Salvini, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, Viktor Orb\u00e1n and a host of other ludicrous strongmen \u2013 or weakmen, as they so often turn out to be \u2013 dominate nations that would once have laughed them off stage. The question is why? Why are the technocrats who held sway almost everywhere a few years ago giving way to extravagant buffoons? Social media, an incubator of absurdity, is certainly part of the story. But while there has been plenty of good work investigating the means, there has been surprisingly little thinking about the ends. Why are the ultra-rich, who until recently used their money and newspapers to promote charisma-free politicians, now funding this circus? Why would capital wish to be represented by middle managers one moment and jesters the next? The reason, I believe, is that the nature of capitalism has changed. The dominant force of the 1990s and early 2000s \u2013 corporate power \u2013 demanded technocratic government. It wanted people who could simultaneously run a competent, secure state and protect profits from democratic change. In 2012, when Bremner made his complaint, power was already shifting to a different place, but politics had not caught up. The policies that were supposed to promote enterprise \u2013 slashing taxes for the rich, ripping down public protections, destroying trade unions \u2013 instead stimulated a powerful spiral of patrimonial wealth accumulation. The largest fortunes are now made not through entrepreneurial brilliance but through inheritance, monopoly and rent-seeking: securing exclusive control of crucial assets such as land and buildings privatised utilities and intellectual property, and assembling service monopolies such as trading hubs, software and social media platforms, then charging user fees far higher than the costs of production and delivery. In Russia, people who enrich themselves this way are called oligarchs. But this is a global phenomenon. Today corporate power is overlain by \u2013 and mutating into \u2013 oligarchic power. What the oligarchs want is not the same as what the old corporations wanted. In the words of their favoured theorist, Steve Bannon, they seek the \u201cdeconstruction of the administrative state\u201d. Chaos is the profit multiplier for the disaster capitalism on which the new billionaires thrive. Every rupture is used to seize more of the assets on which our lives depend. The chaos of an undeliverable Brexit, the repeated meltdowns and shutdowns of government under Trump: these are the kind of deconstructions Bannon foresaw. As institutions, rules and democratic oversight implode, the oligarchs extend their wealth and power at our expense. The killer clowns offer the oligarchs something else too: distraction and deflection. While the kleptocrats fleece us, we are urged to look elsewhere. We are mesmerised by buffoons who encourage us to channel the anger that should be reserved for billionaires towards immigrants, women, Jews, Muslims, people of colour and other imaginary enemies and customary scapegoats. Just as it was in the 1930s, the new demagoguery is a con, a revolt against the impacts of capital, financed by capitalists. The oligarch\u2019s interests always lie offshore: in tax havens and secrecy regimes. Paradoxically, these interests are best promoted by nationalists and nativists. The politicians who most loudly proclaim their patriotism and defence of sovereignty are always the first to sell their nations down the river. It is no coincidence that most of the newspapers promoting the nativist agenda, whipping up hatred against immigrants and thundering about sovereignty, are owned by billionaire tax exiles, living offshore.

In this offshore world, they contend, \u201cfinancialised and hypermobile global capital effectively is the state\u201d. Today\u2019s billionaires are the real citizens of nowhere. They fantasise, like the plutocrats in Ayn Rand\u2019s terrible novel Atlas Shrugged, about further escape. Look at the \u201cseasteading\u201d venture funded by PayPal\u2019s founder, Peter Thiel, that sought to build artificial islands in the middle of the ocean, whose citizens could enact a libertarian fantasy of escape from the state, its laws, regulations and taxes, and from organised labour. Scarcely a month goes by without a billionaire raising the prospect of leaving the Earth altogether, and colonising space pods or other planets. Those whose identity is offshore seek only to travel farther offshore.

I\u2019m not at the moment prepared to answer that question. If you\u2019d asked me that question six months ago it would have been completely unthinkable. One can posit all these Doomsday scenarios so I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m not going to answer the question.</p> \n<p>\u201cMost MPs are clear they would all support the government come what may. Then there is a very small minority in which they say there are circumstances in which they couldn\u2019t. I\u2019m kind of in between. I would find it very hard and I\u2019m hopeful that other means will be found.

      "bodyText": "Margot James, who resigned as a minister to oppose a no-deal Brexit, has expressed concern that Boris Johnson\u2019s cabinet represents a \u201cmassive shift to the right\u201d, and refused to rule out quitting the Conservative party. In an interview with the Guardian, the MP for Stourbridge said the new prime minister\u2019s decision to pack his top team with veterans of the leave campaign confirmed his single-minded focus on leaving the EU on 31 October come what may. \u201cThe best I can say is, I think we know where we are. Boris Johnson has been very decisive and very clear, and I know his start will go down very well with the people in my party who voted for him. And he\u2019s thrown down the gauntlet by creating a government which is a massive shift to the right, and to a hard Brexit,\u201d she said. James, a former businesswoman, was creative industries minister before quitting earlier this month to support an amendment making it harder for a new PM to prorogue parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit. She said she could not have served under Johnson, given his commitment to the 31 October deadline, and would not be able to stand again as a Conservative MP if he were to campaign on a no-deal platform at the election. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that I couldn\u2019t canvass for Boris if the policy platform sat OK with me. I still feel that he\u2019s been elected by the party and deserves a chance. Yes, I do feel that. And even though he didn\u2019t rise to the position of foreign secretary, maybe he will rise to the position of prime minister,\u201d she said. But if the manifesto was to leave the EU without a deal, \u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t campaign for that\u201d, she said. \u201cI\u2019m still hopeful he will get a deal, and he will get sufficient change to get it through parliament. But until he shows he\u2019s done that, the jury\u2019s out,\u201d she added. As Johnson appointed a series of rightwingers to his No 10 operation and cabinet, James also raised concerns that some of the \u201cshady people\u201d around him and some of those who \u201cfunded the original referendum campaign\u201d would want to take the administration in the direction of slashing corporate taxes and regulations. \u201cThere is a cadre of owners of large private companies who want Brexit because they want a low-tax, low-regulation economy,\u201d she said. James said any relaxation in the pace of deficit reduction should go towards funding public service priorities such as policing and social care rather than sweeping tax cuts. \u201cIt worries me about the country because I don\u2019t think they\u2019re the right policy goals,\u201d she said. The former business and media minister said there was no benefit to a no-deal Brexit, and criticised \u201carrogant politicians, most of whom have never been in business, or run a business, to think that they know better than the people running companies in this country\u201d. James is one of the senior Conservative MPs who resigned before Johnson took office and made clear they would fight a no-deal Brexit, saying she now felt freer to \u201cresist the Steve Baker vision of the world\u201d on a cross-party basis. The former chancellor Philip Hammond, ex-justice secretary David Gauke and former development secretary Rory Stewart were among those who made clear they would not serve under Johnson. They are expected to join the ranks of vocal rebels on the Tory backbenches. James denied earlier this week that she could be on the brink of defecting to the Liberal Democrats. But asked whether she could quit the party like Nick Boles, who is now an independent, she said: \u201cI am really going one month at a time now. My goal is to make sure we leave in an orderly way with a negotiated settlement. And the other goal is to make sure we do not leave as the legal default implies without a deal. \u201cI wish to achieve those goals with minimum damage to my party. A lot more colleagues are thinking more about what is in the national interest.\u201d James refused to say whether she was one of those Tory MPs \u2013 like Hammond and Dominic Grieve \u2013 who would countenance voting down a Johnson administration pursuing no deal, even if it could trigger a general election. Asked if she would face a difficult decision, she said: \u201cVery. I\u2019m not at the moment prepared to answer that question. If you\u2019d asked me that question six months ago it would have been completely unthinkable. One can posit all these Doomsday scenarios so I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m not going to answer the question. \u201cMost MPs are clear they would all support the government come what may. Then there is a very small minority in which they say there are circumstances in which they couldn\u2019t. I\u2019m kind of in between. I would find it very hard and I\u2019m hopeful that other means will be found. Most of all, I\u2019m hopeful most of all that Boris will tone down his Brexit policy.\u201d However, she said no one could predict whether the new PM was prepared to disappoint hardline Eurosceptics, to whom he has made a promise to scrap the backstop and strike a completely new deal with Brussels. \u201cBoris uses a lot of language. We don\u2019t know yet whether he is able to adjust his style, or whether he even wants to \u2013 but it\u2019s what my father would call \u2018loose talk\u2019. I think it comes from the war: \u2018Loose talk costs lives.\u2019 It\u2019s unsubstantiated, quickly backtracked from words, that sound good the moment you use them. His campaign has been full of that \u2013 and maybe he will change. So we don\u2019t know yet,\u201d she said. James said she believed about 25 Conservative MPs might be prepared to vote against no deal once resignations from Johnson\u2019s government were complete. And she was cryptic about the possibility of Tories joining Labour and Lib Dem MPs to form a government of national unity to avoid no deal, amid several reports that preliminary talks were already happening. \u201cI am aware I\u2019m on the record, so I\u2019m not going to comment on that,\u201d she said.",

      "body": "<p>It was still dark on the morning of 25 October 2013, when police smashed down the door of a seemingly empty two-floor house in a rural corner of Chesterfield. Once inside they found that their tip-off had been correct: the house, which at one time would have been a comfortable family home, was now a fully-functioning cannabis farm, complete with dozens of fully-grown cannabis plants, thousands of pounds\u2019 worth of lights and equipment, and one terrified Vietnamese boy.</p> <p>The boy had been asleep on a mattress in the living room when the police raid started. He had been jolted awake to the sound of loud banging and splintering wood as the front door gave way. The house, so long devoid of air and natural light, was suddenly flooded with flashlights and the noise of shouts and stamping boots. Minh (not his real name) scrambled backwards into a corner as he was surrounded by men in uniform asking him questions in English that he couldn\u2019t understand. \u201cI was very, very scared of these men,\u201d he recalled recently. \u201cBut then I let myself believe that maybe they had come to rescue me.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/aug/12/enslaved-on-a-british-cannabis-farm-the-plants-were-more-valuable-than-my-life-podcast\">Enslaved on a British cannabis farm: \u2018The plants were more valuable than my life\u2019 \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Minh was one of the hundreds of children trafficked from Vietnam every year and forced to work in hidden cannabis farms across the UK: small cogs in the vast criminal machine that supplies Britain\u2019s \u00a32.6bn cannabis black market. Children such as Minh are valuable assets for those who run cannabis farms: cheap, expendable, and easy to control and intimidate. They are smuggled overland from Vietnam to the UK, and trapped in a form of modern slavery that is now widespread across Britain.</p> <p><a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/749346/2018_UK_Annual_Report_on_Modern_Slavery.pdf\" title=\"\">Official estimate</a><a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/749346/2018_UK_Annual_Report_on_Modern_Slavery.pdf\" title=\"\">s</a> say around 13,000 individuals are trapped in some form of enslavement across the UK, and Vietnamese people make up the third-largest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/oct/18/nail-bars-car-washes-uk-slavery-problem-anti-slavery-day\" title=\"\">group of victims</a>, with more than half of them under 18. Over the last three years, the British government has identified 491 Vietnamese minors as potential child-trafficking victims, the majority of them teenage boys working in cannabis cultivation. These are only the ones who have been found. Thousands more are estimated to be working undetected in makeshift cannabis farms in suburban houses, empty flats, deserted warehouses and derelict industrial estates. Others are forced to work in nail bars, brothels and restaurants, or kept in domestic servitude behind the doors of private residences.</p> <p>Minh was 16 when he arrived in the UK. When he emerged from the back of a lorry somewhere near Dover in June 2013, he had no idea where he was or where he had been since he left Vietnam. He only knew he was here to work.</p> <p>His memories of the three months he spent locked in the house are fractured and distorted by the fear, loneliness and stress that consumed him. His only visitors were Vietnamese men who would appear at the house every few weeks to check he was looking after the plants properly. They barely talked to him, leaving boxes of frozen meat that he heated up in an old microwave in the kitchen. They always locked the door behind them when they left. Apart from that, he was always alone. Behind the blackout blinds, days merged into night and back to day. Inside, Minh sat in the dark and the filth. He was hungry all the time, and terrified his food would run out. After a few days, the sweet, thick stench of the cannabis buds was overpowering, making him sick with headaches and nausea. He knew he would be in terrible trouble if the plants died, so every day he carried buckets of water upstairs to the plants and mixed chemicals into the soil.</p> <p>Once, he says, he tried to get away, but was caught and brought back to the house, and was made to understand that he\u2019d be killed if he tried to escape again. \u201cIt was like another kind of world,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t really even feel human. I understood very quickly that the plants were more valuable than my life.\u201d</p> <p>The day of the police raid marked the end of Minh\u2019s enslavement and his liberation from his traffickers. But his ordeal was not over. Instead, Minh would find himself trapped in a system that treated him as a criminal rather than a victim. After being enslaved by drug gangs, he would be illegally incarcerated and violently assaulted while under the protection of the state. His fight for justice would lead to a landmark high court battle that raised painful and troubling questions about how the UK treats foreign children who have been trafficked and enslaved on British soil.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Minh was born in poverty in a small village in the south of Vietnam in the mid-1990s. His mother and father were smallholding farmers who grew just about enough rice to feed the three of them. By the time he was 16, Minh longed to get away. When his chance came to follow some friends to Ho Chi Min city, he took it. He has not seen his parents since.</p> <p>In Ho Chi Min, Minh says, he met up with friends and kicked around the city for a few days. They took him to a house full of much older men who he didn\u2019t know. The men told him that they knew he was poor and needed work, and asked if he would he like to go to the UK. It was no problem, they said, that Minh didn\u2019t have any money. He could pay them back when he started working.</p> <p>Minh didn\u2019t trust these men. He told them he wanted to go home. He looked to his friends for help, but they wouldn\u2019t meet his eye. He says he was then dragged into another room, punched and kicked to the ground, and beaten with sticks. For the next few days he was kept in the house and forced to give the men oral sex. He was repeatedly raped. By the time the men showed Minh a piece of paper that said he owed them \u00a320,000 for his passage to Europe, he was so terrified that he signed it. For extra insurance, the men told him they knew where his parents lived. If he didn\u2019t pay the money back, they would hurt them, too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"66d1781d4558c524dbef1f42045ab7b55d0164c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66d1781d4558c524dbef1f42045ab7b55d0164c6/0_0_2600_1560/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A police raid of a cannabis factory in a house in east London last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A police raid of a cannabis factory in a house in east London last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lewis Whyld/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So began Minh\u2019s journey towards the cannabis farm in Chesterfield. <a href=\"https://www.ecpat.org.uk/Handlers/Download.ashx?IDMF=2efc482a-f75c-471b-8373-8226f7609f58\" title=\"\">The route</a> he was taken on \u2013 overland across Russia, through eastern Europe to France and crossing to the UK in the back of a lorry \u2013 is the same that hundreds, if not thousands, of Vietnamese children take every year. Many of those making this journey have chosen to leave home, paying smugglers up to \u00a330,000 for their passage to the UK and the promise of work in the thriving Vietnamese diaspora when they arrive.</p> <p>Child-protection experts say the distinction between illegal migration and trafficking is a fragile one. \u201cI\u2019ve interviewed about 40 Vietnamese children who have travelled this route, and all of them without exception have been harmed and exploited on the way,\u201d says Mimi Vu, an anti-trafficking consultant. \u201cThere is this very deep-rooted belief that it is their filial responsibility to provide for their family, and that the debt is their burden to shoulder. It gives people who are looking to exploit and profit from them huge leverage.\u201d</p> <p>On his journey to the UK, Minh was passed from gang to gang, sleeping in a network of filthy apartments often crowded with other young Vietnamese boys and girls. He says he was beaten, starved and sexually assaulted. When Minh finally arrived in the UK, he knew no one, spoke no English, and he was frightened and in debt.</p> <p>\u201cThese are just the prime conditions for exploitation,\u201d says Vu. \u201cThe only people these kids know and can rely on by this point are their traffickers, who are in complete control of their lives.\u201d Within hours of arriving, many of these children disappear into an underground world of illegal work.</p> <p>The set-up that police found in Chesterfield \u2013 an empty property crudely converted into a cannabis farm using high-end but easily available growing technology, and one or two foreign \u201cgardeners\u201d \u2013 has been seen over and over again in cannabis busts nationwide. In 2014, the last year for which figures are available, <a href=\"https://www.npcc.police.uk/Publication/FINAL%20PRESS%20CULTIVATION%20OF%20CANNABIS%202.pdf\" title=\"\">police seized</a> a total of 276,676 cannabis plants at thousands of properties across the UK, with an estimated street value of \u00a362m. </p> <p>\u201cVietnamese kids have always been trafficked into illegal work, but cannabis is a perfect industry for their exploitation,\u201d says Vu. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to conceal someone in an empty house, the police see cannabis cultivation as a low priority, and if they do raid the house, the kid is usually too terrified to share anything worthwhile with them. And they\u2019ve broken the law, so they\u2019re likely to be seen as criminals first and victims second.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>When a confused and frightened Minh<strong> </strong>was interviewed at Chesterfield police station in October 2013, he didn\u2019t tell officers about how he had come to be in the cannabis house, or that he had been forced to look after the plants. \u201cThey didn\u2019t ask, so I didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I was allowed.\u201d</p> <p>Because he was 16, he was remanded into local authority care and told he would have to appear in front of a judge to answer criminal charges. There were no foster places available, so he was driven to a B&amp;B on the outskirts of Chesterfield by a social worker and told to wait for someone to tell him what to do next. But every time Minh thought about the police or going in front of a judge, he felt like his heart would explode with panic. The only people he knew in the UK \u2013 his traffickers \u2013 had told him that if the police found him they would put him in prison and never let him out again. They said that if he got the chance, he should run. So that\u2019s what he did.</p> <p>He left the B&amp;B with \u00a330 that the social worker had given him and took a bus to Sheffield. \u201cWhen I got off the bus, I was in a strange city,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I began to feel guilty about getting into trouble, so I tried to get back to the house, but by then I didn\u2019t know the way back.\u201d</p> <p>Minh wandered aimlessly around Sheffield for two days, sitting in parks, picking food out of bins and sleeping at the train station. Then, on the third day, while sitting on a park bench, he was approached by an older Vietnamese man who spoke kindly to him in his own language and offered him food and somewhere to stay. Minh remained with the man and his family, first in Sheffield and then in Liverpool, for more than two years. But this all changed in February 2016 when he was picked up during an immigration raid in Liverpool. When his records were checked and his outstanding cannabis cultivation charge was found, he was arrested again.</p> <p>This time, Minh told the police what had happened to him in the cannabis house in Chesterfield. They called the Home Office, who sent an immigration official to interview him. They immediately passed his details on to the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/human-trafficking-victims-referral-and-assessment-forms/guidance-on-the-national-referral-mechanism-for-potential-adult-victims-of-modern-slavery-england-and-wales\" title=\"\">National Referral Mechanism</a> (NRM), which identifies and offers protection to victims of human trafficking. A few days later, the Home Office said there were reasonable grounds to assume Minh had been a victim of slavery.</p> <p>At this point, his criminal charges should have been suspended, but the Crown prosecution service was never informed of the Home Office\u2019s decision. Minh\u2019s lawyer had no experience of trafficking cases and advised him to plead guilty. A month later, Minh\u2019s case went to court and he was convicted of cannabis production and sentenced to eight months at Glen Parva young offenders institution in Leicestershire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Being locked up again in Glen Parva had a catastrophic effect on Minh. Before it was closed in 2017, Glen Parva <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/05/young-offenders-institution-unsafe-chief-inspector-prisons-glen-parva\" title=\"\">was notorious</a> as one of the UK\u2019s worst places to be incarcerated. A few years before Minh arrived, conditions had been condemned by the government\u2019s Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) as \u201cdeplorable\u201d and a \u201ctoxic melting pot\u201d of gang rivalry, bullying and mismanagement. It was also, according to the IMB, dangerous, unsanitary and under-resourced.</p> <p>Minh, who at the time still spoke no English, was locked in his cell for up to 21 hours a day. He says he was bullied by both inmates and staff, denied food and racially abused. There were a number of other Vietnamese teenagers at Glen Parva, most of them on cannabis cultivation charges, but they were of little comfort to each other. \u201cWe were kept apart, and even when we saw each other, what did we have to say? All of us knew that nobody was coming to help us,\u201d says Minh.</p> <p>Four months into his eight-month sentence, Minh \u2013 who was acknowledged as a model prisoner by staff \u2013 was told he was about to be released. \u201cI thought I was going back to Liverpool,\u201d he says. But two days before he was to be released, Minh was told the Home Office had decided to detain him indefinitely under immigration powers.</p> <p>When he did leave, it was in the back of another prison van. In June 2016, he was taken from his cell in handcuffs, and would be held in a series of immigration detention centres for another 13 months.</p> <p>Under official Home Office guidelines, detention is deemed unsuitable for trafficking victims because it is recognised as a potentially replicating the isolation, submission and physical constriction that they suffered at the hands of their traffickers. Despite this, the first piece of research into this issue, which was based on responses to extensive freedom of information requests and published this month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jul/09/more-than-500-victims-of-trafficking-detained-in-2018-uk-study-finds\" title=\"\">estimated that</a> at least 507 victims of trafficking were in detention in prisons and immigration centres across the country in 2018.</p> <p>Now, six years after Minh was found at the cannabis farm in Chesterfield, Derbyshire police have acknowledged that serious errors were made that led to his being detained as a criminal. When the officers who conducted the raid found Minh, they should have followed official protocol and used a set of human-trafficking indicators to identify that he was a potential victim. </p> <p>Over the phone from Chesterfield, Det Insp Carl Chetwyn told me that Derbyshire police\u2019s approach and awareness of modern slavery has changed since 2013, especially after the establishment of the UK\u2019s Modern Slavery Act of 2015. \u201cI really believe that what happened to that individual in 2013 wouldn\u2019t happen now,\u201d said Chetwyn. Derbyshire police now have one of the UK\u2019s only dedicated modern slavery and trafficking units in their regional headquarters. \u201cIn a case like that, any child found inside a cannabis farm would and should be automatically taken out of that situation and given contact with social care and referred into the NRM,\u201d said Chetwyn. \u201cWe can\u2019t arrest our way out of this criminality.\u201d</p> <p>But across the UK, children found in cannabis farms are still being criminalised. \u201cTraining is so patchy that you have areas of good practice, but there are large parts of the UK where the police still don\u2019t know how to recognise child-trafficking,\u201d says Lynne Chitty, who is programme director for anti-trafficking charity <a href=\"https://love146.org/\" title=\"\">Love 146</a> and has run a safe house for child-trafficking victims in the south of England for 10 years. \u201cKids who should be protected are still being badly failed.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In March 2017, Kate Macpherson, a trainee lawyer with law firm Duncan Lewis, arrived at Brook House, a sprawling, low-rise immigration removal centre near Gatwick airport. Macpherson was there to assess a new client who had just been taken on by a senior colleague and had been identified as needing urgent assistance.</p> <p>Macpherson made her way through the security checks and met up with a translator, and together they walked to a small interview room at the back of the centre. Through the glass Macpherson saw a small, slight Vietnamese teenager sitting bent over at a table dressed in a T-shirt and tracksuit bottoms. It was Minh.</p> <p>Macpherson had interviewed other detainees in immigration detention before, but immediately saw that Minh was in extreme distress. He was pale and shaking, his body covered in a red raw rash. \u201cHe could barely communicate,\u201d she says. \u201cEven speaking Vietnamese to the translator, he was unable to answer very basic questions. His mind was all over the place. He couldn\u2019t make eye contact. He had completely withdrawn into himself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen I walked away from that first meeting I had this sense of real panic,\u201d she says. \u201cIt felt really very wrong to be leaving this very young and extremely vulnerable young person in an environment that was so clearly causing him immense pain and psychological stress. I understood enough from what he\u2019d told me that he was quite possibly a victim of trafficking.\u201d</p> <p>The next day, Macpherson\u2019s colleague at Duncan Lewis, Ahmed Aydeed, started to go through Minh\u2019s case notes. At 32, Aydeed is ambitious about using public law to force change in the UK\u2019s immigration system. He had already taken on more than a dozen clients who had been trafficked in the UK, but Minh\u2019s story stood out.</p> <p>Aydeed and Macpherson met with Minh multiple times over the next month, piecing together what had happened to him since he arrived in the UK. Even though Minh was slowly revealing his story, something about his case bothered Aydeed and Macpherson. \u201cWe just got the sense that something really terrible had happened to him in immigration detention that he wasn\u2019t disclosing,\u201d says Aydeed. It took them a few more weeks to gain Minh\u2019s trust before he could tell them what had happened.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"648172ae9960f724b5a78e257d963e8116742fd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/648172ae9960f724b5a78e257d963e8116742fd4/0_246_4096_2457/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Morton Hall Immigration Removal Centre in Lincolnshire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Morton Hall Immigration Removal Centre in Lincolnshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Heathcliff O'Malley/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Minh eventually described how, in October 2016, a few months after being transferred to Morton Hall immigration removal centre, he was attacked and sexually assaulted by another inmate, who trapped him in his cell and tried to rape him. Later that day, Minh and a friend saw his attacker in the dining hall and a scuffle broke out. When he was interviewed by staff about the commotion, Minh told them about the assault. Under their own policies, Morton Hall should have immediately launched an investigation and reported the attack to the police. But they did nothing.</p> <p>For Minh, the sexual assault did serious damage to his already fragile mental health. It was, he says, like a kind of death, triggering vivid and violent memories of being raped by his traffickers. \u201cIt just felt like my life was over. I just understood that I was not safe anywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cI was very scared of the other inmates and that something like this would happen again. I knew I couldn\u2019t trust the staff there to protect me.\u201d</p> <p>Aydeed experienced what he described as \u201ccold fury\u201d when he learned what had happened to his client in Morton Hall. \u201cThe attack had happened more than five months before we first met Minh, but nothing had been done to protect him,\u201d he says.</p> <p>When Minh\u2019s lawyers demanded an explanation from Morton Hall, the management initially said they hadn\u2019t considered the attack a serious incident, and that Minh \u201cdid not suffer as a result\u201d. Yet Minh had repeatedly told medical staff he was a victim of sexual and physical violence. He also told them he was experiencing relentless flashbacks. He often couldn\u2019t sleep, and when he did, he had violent nightmares about being hunted.</p> <p>\u201cWhat they had on their hands was someone who had repeatedly disclosed that he had experienced rape, trauma, abduction, trafficking and torture,\u201d says Aydeed. \u201cTheir failure to take this assault seriously was at best incompetence and at worst an indication of the culture of disbelief and disregard for the detainees in their care.\u201d</p> <p>The solicitors threatened legal action if the Home Office didn\u2019t reconsider Minh\u2019s case. On 12 May 2017, the Home Office formally identified Minh as a victim of modern slavery, yet still refused to release him from detention. When the solicitors demanded the Home Office open an investigation into his trafficking, the Home Office launched proceedings to deport him back to Vietnam, setting a removal date of 26 May. Minh was hours away from deportation when his solicitors got the removal orders against him quashed.</p> <p>\u201cThey just fought and fought us on his case,\u201d says Aydeed. \u201cEven when they had admitted that he had probably been illegally detained, even when they admitted that he was a victim of trafficking, they just would not release him. It was almost perverse.\u201d</p> <p>After Minh was identified as a victim of trafficking, Duncan Lewis commissioned an independent medical assessment. Dr Frank Arnold of Forrest Medico-Legal Services, a global specialist who helps document the experiences of victims of torture, visited Minh at Brook House. Afterwards, Arnold wrote a blistering report concluding that Minh\u2019s physical scars were consistent with a history of violent physical and sexual abuse, and that he was suffering from acute PTSD. He had, Arnold\u2019s report concluded, suffered considerably at the hands of both his traffickers and the UK government.</p> <p>\u201cDuring my time as anti-slavery commissioner, I saw child victims from Vietnam go through absolute hell,\u201d said Kevin Hyland, who worked at the Metropolitan police before becoming the UK\u2019s first anti-slavery commissioner in 2015, when the Modern Slavery Act was established. \u201cAnd then when they get pulled into our criminal justice system, it\u2019s as if they\u2019re entering this vast machine, where once you\u2019re inside it is almost impossible to change course. The Home Office ends up defending a position almost as if it\u2019s gone beyond the point where they can see people as human beings,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Other anti-trafficking experts have warned that many trafficking victims, who often have insecure immigration status, fell prey to the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/27/hostile-environment-anatomy-of-a-policy-disaster\" title=\"\">hostile environment</a>\u201d approach towards immigration adopted during Theresa May\u2019s time as home secretary.</p> <p>On the morning of 14 June 2017, Minh finally walked out of immigration detention and into a safe house arranged by the Salvation Army. It had been three years and eight months since he was escorted out of the cannabis house, imagining he had been rescued.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Meeting Minh today, it\u2019s hard to square the slight, softly spoken young man in his early 20s, in pressed blue jeans and trainers and tidy, gel-spiked hair, with the horrors that he has lived through. Yet often in our interviews his face slips, and you see the boy trapped among the plants in that airless, empty house six years ago.</p> <p>He says that after he was released from detention in 2017, he struggled to adapt. There were other young Vietnamese men in the safe house, but he sat in his room in a state of high anxiety thinking that someone was going to come and take him back to the detention centre.</p> <p>Rachel Thomas, a clinical psychologist specialising in complex mental health and trauma, was hired by Duncan Lewis to write a psychological assessment of Minh after he was released. Thomas has done similar assessments of scores of other trafficking victims, but vividly remembers her meetings with Minh at his safe house. She recalls him looking \u201csmall and slight and extremely young, much younger than his actual age, and very fragile\u201d.</p> <p>In her report, she writes: \u201cHis sleep is currently limited to about four hours a night. He is woken by nightmares about being attacked and chased. He is kept awake by intrusive memories of his experiences at the hands of his traffickers. They have become more intense and frequent since his detention, particuarly following the sexual abuse \u2026 during his stay at Morton Hall.\u201d</p> <p>During his assessment, Minh disclosed something he had also told Dr Frank Arnold: that after his failed escape from the cannabis house in Chesterfield, his traffickers had held him down, made a cut on his genitals and told him they had inserted a tracking device into his body. Thomas said that even if there was no tracking device, the psychological impact on the 16-year-old Minh had been immense: \u201cEven when he was in a safe place and had been recognised as a victim, he continued to believe that the traffickers were in ultimate control over his life,\u201d she says.</p> <p>After Minh\u2019s release from detention, Aydeed and the team at Duncan Lewis launched legal proceedings against both the Home Office and the Ministry of Justice for failing to protect Minh, and for failing to launch an investigation after the attempted rape at Morton Hall. Over the next 18 months, the team also pursued a separate judicial review against the Home Office. They argued that Minh was a victim of child trafficking, who had been systematically failed by the Home Office, which had criminalised and illegally detained their client over a four-year period, and then attempted to deport him back to Vietnam before a criminal investigation into his human trafficking had been concluded.</p> <p>For Minh, this battle for justice has been crucial in his own slow journey to some kind of recovery. \u201cAfter the incident at Morton Hall it was like I had split into two different people,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know who I am any more, but maybe there is a way to build a life for myself again. I used to talk a lot and laugh, and wanted to meet people and see things, but now I don\u2019t feel like that any more. When I look in the mirror, I see someone else there, someone I don\u2019t recognise, who is much older and who has been through awful things.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes, he says, he finds it strange to walk the streets and be surrounded by people who have no idea what he has survived. \u201cSince I left detention I have always felt scared, especially when I thought about how I was trying to fight the police and the Home Office,\u201d he says. \u201cIt would be easier to just leave it alone. But I have to try my best to get justice, to take back my life. I have to trust that things can be better.\u201d</p> <p>In June 2018, Minh won his judicial review against the Home Office. The government accepts that it illegally detained him in prison, and then under immigration powers in Glen Parva and in immigration detention. When Minh heard the news, he felt the pressure lift for the first time in months. \u201cWhen they admitted that what had happened to me was wrong and I had been treated unjustly, I think I really understood for the first time none of this was my fault.\u201d</p> <p>Then, on a cold morning in November last year, Minh received an ecstatic message from the team at Duncan Lewis. A court of appeal had quashed his conviction for cannabis cultivation. He was no longer a criminal in the eyes of the UK authorities. For Minh, this felt like a rebirth. Ever since he had been released from immigration detention, he had been trying to relearn how to live in the world, just going about the normal business of cooking food and washing clothes and getting through the day. \u201cBut all the time, the fact that I was a criminal was there, it felt like a black mark on my forehead,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I have a bit of peace, now I can learn how to be a good person in this society, and maybe be of help, be a useful person.\u201d Last month, Minh won \u00a385,000 in compensation from the Home Office and the Ministry of Justice for the illegal detention and failure to protect him in immigration detention.</p> <p>When asked to comment on his case, a government spokesperson said: \u201cThe welfare of vulnerable detainees is of the utmost importance, and we are carefully considering the implications of this case. We have made significant improvements in recent years, but \u2026 we are committed to going further and faster in exploring alternatives to detention, increasing transparency around it and improving the support available for vulnerable detainees.\u201d</p> <p>The final battle to get Minh leave to remain in the UK will be concluded in the next few months. He is convinced that if he is sent back to Vietnam there is a high chance he will be trafficked again, or killed by the same gang who forced him into debt bondage as a teenager. It is far from certain that Minh will be allowed to stay. Despite talking itself up as a global leader in the fight against modern slavery, the Home Office only grants 12% of trafficking victims leave to remain. A recent <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/janebradley/child-trafficking-victims-refused-uk\" title=\"\">investigation</a> by Buzzfeed UK found that the government approved only 16 out of 326 applications made by children officially recognised as victims of slavery who had requested discretionary leave to remain between April 2017 and the end of 2018.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/04/inside-the-21st-century-british-criminal-underworld\">Inside the 21st-century British criminal underworld</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Aydeed remains positive, and Minh wants to stay and try and build a life for himself in the UK, despite everything that has happened to him here.

      "bodyText": "It was still dark on the morning of 25 October 2013, when police smashed down the door of a seemingly empty two-floor house in a rural corner of Chesterfield. Once inside they found that their tip-off had been correct: the house, which at one time would have been a comfortable family home, was now a fully-functioning cannabis farm, complete with dozens of fully-grown cannabis plants, thousands of pounds\u2019 worth of lights and equipment, and one terrified Vietnamese boy. The boy had been asleep on a mattress in the living room when the police raid started. He had been jolted awake to the sound of loud banging and splintering wood as the front door gave way. The house, so long devoid of air and natural light, was suddenly flooded with flashlights and the noise of shouts and stamping boots. Minh (not his real name) scrambled backwards into a corner as he was surrounded by men in uniform asking him questions in English that he couldn\u2019t understand. \u201cI was very, very scared of these men,\u201d he recalled recently. \u201cBut then I let myself believe that maybe they had come to rescue me.\u201d Minh was one of the hundreds of children trafficked from Vietnam every year and forced to work in hidden cannabis farms across the UK: small cogs in the vast criminal machine that supplies Britain\u2019s \u00a32.6bn cannabis black market. Children such as Minh are valuable assets for those who run cannabis farms: cheap, expendable, and easy to control and intimidate. They are smuggled overland from Vietnam to the UK, and trapped in a form of modern slavery that is now widespread across Britain. Official estimates say around 13,000 individuals are trapped in some form of enslavement across the UK, and Vietnamese people make up the third-largest group of victims, with more than half of them under 18. Over the last three years, the British government has identified 491 Vietnamese minors as potential child-trafficking victims, the majority of them teenage boys working in cannabis cultivation. These are only the ones who have been found. Thousands more are estimated to be working undetected in makeshift cannabis farms in suburban houses, empty flats, deserted warehouses and derelict industrial estates. Others are forced to work in nail bars, brothels and restaurants, or kept in domestic servitude behind the doors of private residences. Minh was 16 when he arrived in the UK. When he emerged from the back of a lorry somewhere near Dover in June 2013, he had no idea where he was or where he had been since he left Vietnam. He only knew he was here to work. His memories of the three months he spent locked in the house are fractured and distorted by the fear, loneliness and stress that consumed him. His only visitors were Vietnamese men who would appear at the house every few weeks to check he was looking after the plants properly. They barely talked to him, leaving boxes of frozen meat that he heated up in an old microwave in the kitchen. They always locked the door behind them when they left. Apart from that, he was always alone. Behind the blackout blinds, days merged into night and back to day. Inside, Minh sat in the dark and the filth. He was hungry all the time, and terrified his food would run out. After a few days, the sweet, thick stench of the cannabis buds was overpowering, making him sick with headaches and nausea. He knew he would be in terrible trouble if the plants died, so every day he carried buckets of water upstairs to the plants and mixed chemicals into the soil. Once, he says, he tried to get away, but was caught and brought back to the house, and was made to understand that he\u2019d be killed if he tried to escape again. \u201cIt was like another kind of world,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t really even feel human. I understood very quickly that the plants were more valuable than my life.\u201d The day of the police raid marked the end of Minh\u2019s enslavement and his liberation from his traffickers. But his ordeal was not over. Instead, Minh would find himself trapped in a system that treated him as a criminal rather than a victim. After being enslaved by drug gangs, he would be illegally incarcerated and violently assaulted while under the protection of the state. His fight for justice would lead to a landmark high court battle that raised painful and troubling questions about how the UK treats foreign children who have been trafficked and enslaved on British soil. * * * Minh was born in poverty in a small village in the south of Vietnam in the mid-1990s. His mother and father were smallholding farmers who grew just about enough rice to feed the three of them. By the time he was 16, Minh longed to get away. When his chance came to follow some friends to Ho Chi Min city, he took it. He has not seen his parents since. In Ho Chi Min, Minh says, he met up with friends and kicked around the city for a few days. They took him to a house full of much older men who he didn\u2019t know. The men told him that they knew he was poor and needed work, and asked if he would he like to go to the UK. It was no problem, they said, that Minh didn\u2019t have any money. He could pay them back when he started working. Minh didn\u2019t trust these men. He told them he wanted to go home. He looked to his friends for help, but they wouldn\u2019t meet his eye. He says he was then dragged into another room, punched and kicked to the ground, and beaten with sticks. For the next few days he was kept in the house and forced to give the men oral sex. He was repeatedly raped. By the time the men showed Minh a piece of paper that said he owed them \u00a320,000 for his passage to Europe, he was so terrified that he signed it. For extra insurance, the men told him they knew where his parents lived. If he didn\u2019t pay the money back, they would hurt them, too. So began Minh\u2019s journey towards the cannabis farm in Chesterfield. The route he was taken on \u2013 overland across Russia, through eastern Europe to France and crossing to the UK in the back of a lorry \u2013 is the same that hundreds, if not thousands, of Vietnamese children take every year. Many of those making this journey have chosen to leave home, paying smugglers up to \u00a330,000 for their passage to the UK and the promise of work in the thriving Vietnamese diaspora when they arrive. Child-protection experts say the distinction between illegal migration and trafficking is a fragile one. \u201cI\u2019ve interviewed about 40 Vietnamese children who have travelled this route, and all of them without exception have been harmed and exploited on the way,\u201d says Mimi Vu, an anti-trafficking consultant. \u201cThere is this very deep-rooted belief that it is their filial responsibility to provide for their family, and that the debt is their burden to shoulder. It gives people who are looking to exploit and profit from them huge leverage.\u201d On his journey to the UK, Minh was passed from gang to gang, sleeping in a network of filthy apartments often crowded with other young Vietnamese boys and girls. He says he was beaten, starved and sexually assaulted. When Minh finally arrived in the UK, he knew no one, spoke no English, and he was frightened and in debt. \u201cThese are just the prime conditions for exploitation,\u201d says Vu. \u201cThe only people these kids know and can rely on by this point are their traffickers, who are in complete control of their lives.\u201d Within hours of arriving, many of these children disappear into an underground world of illegal work. The set-up that police found in Chesterfield \u2013 an empty property crudely converted into a cannabis farm using high-end but easily available growing technology, and one or two foreign \u201cgardeners\u201d \u2013 has been seen over and over again in cannabis busts nationwide. In 2014, the last year for which figures are available, police seized a total of 276,676 cannabis plants at thousands of properties across the UK, with an estimated street value of \u00a362m. \u201cVietnamese kids have always been trafficked into illegal work, but cannabis is a perfect industry for their exploitation,\u201d says Vu. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to conceal someone in an empty house, the police see cannabis cultivation as a low priority, and if they do raid the house, the kid is usually too terrified to share anything worthwhile with them. And they\u2019ve broken the law, so they\u2019re likely to be seen as criminals first and victims second.\u201d * * * When a confused and frightened Minh was interviewed at Chesterfield police station in October 2013, he didn\u2019t tell officers about how he had come to be in the cannabis house, or that he had been forced to look after the plants. \u201cThey didn\u2019t ask, so I didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I was allowed.\u201d Because he was 16, he was remanded into local authority care and told he would have to appear in front of a judge to answer criminal charges. There were no foster places available, so he was driven to a B&amp;B on the outskirts of Chesterfield by a social worker and told to wait for someone to tell him what to do next. But every time Minh thought about the police or going in front of a judge, he felt like his heart would explode with panic. The only people he knew in the UK \u2013 his traffickers \u2013 had told him that if the police found him they would put him in prison and never let him out again. They said that if he got the chance, he should run. So that\u2019s what he did. He left the B&amp;B with \u00a330 that the social worker had given him and took a bus to Sheffield. \u201cWhen I got off the bus, I was in a strange city,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I began to feel guilty about getting into trouble, so I tried to get back to the house, but by then I didn\u2019t know the way back.\u201d Minh wandered aimlessly around Sheffield for two days, sitting in parks, picking food out of bins and sleeping at the train station. Then, on the third day, while sitting on a park bench, he was approached by an older Vietnamese man who spoke kindly to him in his own language and offered him food and somewhere to stay. Minh remained with the man and his family, first in Sheffield and then in Liverpool, for more than two years. But this all changed in February 2016 when he was picked up during an immigration raid in Liverpool. When his records were checked and his outstanding cannabis cultivation charge was found, he was arrested again. This time, Minh told the police what had happened to him in the cannabis house in Chesterfield. They called the Home Office, who sent an immigration official to interview him. They immediately passed his details on to the National Referral Mechanism (NRM), which identifies and offers protection to victims of human trafficking. A few days later, the Home Office said there were reasonable grounds to assume Minh had been a victim of slavery. At this point, his criminal charges should have been suspended, but the Crown prosecution service was never informed of the Home Office\u2019s decision. Minh\u2019s lawyer had no experience of trafficking cases and advised him to plead guilty. A month later, Minh\u2019s case went to court and he was convicted of cannabis production and sentenced to eight months at Glen Parva young offenders institution in Leicestershire. Being locked up again in Glen Parva had a catastrophic effect on Minh. Before it was closed in 2017, Glen Parva was notorious as one of the UK\u2019s worst places to be incarcerated. A few years before Minh arrived, conditions had been condemned by the government\u2019s Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) as \u201cdeplorable\u201d and a \u201ctoxic melting pot\u201d of gang rivalry, bullying and mismanagement. It was also, according to the IMB, dangerous, unsanitary and under-resourced. Minh, who at the time still spoke no English, was locked in his cell for up to 21 hours a day. He says he was bullied by both inmates and staff, denied food and racially abused. There were a number of other Vietnamese teenagers at Glen Parva, most of them on cannabis cultivation charges, but they were of little comfort to each other. \u201cWe were kept apart, and even when we saw each other, what did we have to say? All of us knew that nobody was coming to help us,\u201d says Minh. Four months into his eight-month sentence, Minh \u2013 who was acknowledged as a model prisoner by staff \u2013 was told he was about to be released. \u201cI thought I was going back to Liverpool,\u201d he says. But two days before he was to be released, Minh was told the Home Office had decided to detain him indefinitely under immigration powers. When he did leave, it was in the back of another prison van. In June 2016, he was taken from his cell in handcuffs, and would be held in a series of immigration detention centres for another 13 months. Under official Home Office guidelines, detention is deemed unsuitable for trafficking victims because it is recognised as a potentially replicating the isolation, submission and physical constriction that they suffered at the hands of their traffickers. Despite this, the first piece of research into this issue, which was based on responses to extensive freedom of information requests and published this month, estimated that at least 507 victims of trafficking were in detention in prisons and immigration centres across the country in 2018. Now, six years after Minh was found at the cannabis farm in Chesterfield, Derbyshire police have acknowledged that serious errors were made that led to his being detained as a criminal. When the officers who conducted the raid found Minh, they should have followed official protocol and used a set of human-trafficking indicators to identify that he was a potential victim. Over the phone from Chesterfield, Det Insp Carl Chetwyn told me that Derbyshire police\u2019s approach and awareness of modern slavery has changed since 2013, especially after the establishment of the UK\u2019s Modern Slavery Act of 2015. \u201cI really believe that what happened to that individual in 2013 wouldn\u2019t happen now,\u201d said Chetwyn. Derbyshire police now have one of the UK\u2019s only dedicated modern slavery and trafficking units in their regional headquarters. \u201cIn a case like that, any child found inside a cannabis farm would and should be automatically taken out of that situation and given contact with social care and referred into the NRM,\u201d said Chetwyn. \u201cWe can\u2019t arrest our way out of this criminality.\u201d But across the UK, children found in cannabis farms are still being criminalised. \u201cTraining is so patchy that you have areas of good practice, but there are large parts of the UK where the police still don\u2019t know how to recognise child-trafficking,\u201d says Lynne Chitty, who is programme director for anti-trafficking charity Love 146 and has run a safe house for child-trafficking victims in the south of England for 10 years. \u201cKids who should be protected are still being badly failed.\u201d * * * In March 2017, Kate Macpherson, a trainee lawyer with law firm Duncan Lewis, arrived at Brook House, a sprawling, low-rise immigration removal centre near Gatwick airport. Macpherson was there to assess a new client who had just been taken on by a senior colleague and had been identified as needing urgent assistance. Macpherson made her way through the security checks and met up with a translator, and together they walked to a small interview room at the back of the centre. Through the glass Macpherson saw a small, slight Vietnamese teenager sitting bent over at a table dressed in a T-shirt and tracksuit bottoms. It was Minh. Macpherson had interviewed other detainees in immigration detention before, but immediately saw that Minh was in extreme distress. He was pale and shaking, his body covered in a red raw rash. \u201cHe could barely communicate,\u201d she says. \u201cEven speaking Vietnamese to the translator, he was unable to answer very basic questions. His mind was all over the place. He couldn\u2019t make eye contact. He had completely withdrawn into himself.\u201d \u201cWhen I walked away from that first meeting I had this sense of real panic,\u201d she says. \u201cIt felt really very wrong to be leaving this very young and extremely vulnerable young person in an environment that was so clearly causing him immense pain and psychological stress. I understood enough from what he\u2019d told me that he was quite possibly a victim of trafficking.\u201d The next day, Macpherson\u2019s colleague at Duncan Lewis, Ahmed Aydeed, started to go through Minh\u2019s case notes. At 32, Aydeed is ambitious about using public law to force change in the UK\u2019s immigration system. He had already taken on more than a dozen clients who had been trafficked in the UK, but Minh\u2019s story stood out. Aydeed and Macpherson met with Minh multiple times over the next month, piecing together what had happened to him since he arrived in the UK. Even though Minh was slowly revealing his story, something about his case bothered Aydeed and Macpherson. \u201cWe just got the sense that something really terrible had happened to him in immigration detention that he wasn\u2019t disclosing,\u201d says Aydeed. It took them a few more weeks to gain Minh\u2019s trust before he could tell them what had happened. Minh eventually described how, in October 2016, a few months after being transferred to Morton Hall immigration removal centre, he was attacked and sexually assaulted by another inmate, who trapped him in his cell and tried to rape him. Later that day, Minh and a friend saw his attacker in the dining hall and a scuffle broke out. When he was interviewed by staff about the commotion, Minh told them about the assault. Under their own policies, Morton Hall should have immediately launched an investigation and reported the attack to the police. But they did nothing. For Minh, the sexual assault did serious damage to his already fragile mental health. It was, he says, like a kind of death, triggering vivid and violent memories of being raped by his traffickers. \u201cIt just felt like my life was over. I just understood that I was not safe anywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cI was very scared of the other inmates and that something like this would happen again. I knew I couldn\u2019t trust the staff there to protect me.\u201d Aydeed experienced what he described as \u201ccold fury\u201d when he learned what had happened to his client in Morton Hall. \u201cThe attack had happened more than five months before we first met Minh, but nothing had been done to protect him,\u201d he says. When Minh\u2019s lawyers demanded an explanation from Morton Hall, the management initially said they hadn\u2019t considered the attack a serious incident, and that Minh \u201cdid not suffer as a result\u201d. Yet Minh had repeatedly told medical staff he was a victim of sexual and physical violence. He also told them he was experiencing relentless flashbacks. He often couldn\u2019t sleep, and when he did, he had violent nightmares about being hunted. \u201cWhat they had on their hands was someone who had repeatedly disclosed that he had experienced rape, trauma, abduction, trafficking and torture,\u201d says Aydeed. \u201cTheir failure to take this assault seriously was at best incompetence and at worst an indication of the culture of disbelief and disregard for the detainees in their care.\u201d The solicitors threatened legal action if the Home Office didn\u2019t reconsider Minh\u2019s case. On 12 May 2017, the Home Office formally identified Minh as a victim of modern slavery, yet still refused to release him from detention. When the solicitors demanded the Home Office open an investigation into his trafficking, the Home Office launched proceedings to deport him back to Vietnam, setting a removal date of 26 May. Minh was hours away from deportation when his solicitors got the removal orders against him quashed. \u201cThey just fought and fought us on his case,\u201d says Aydeed. \u201cEven when they had admitted that he had probably been illegally detained, even when they admitted that he was a victim of trafficking, they just would not release him. It was almost perverse.\u201d After Minh was identified as a victim of trafficking, Duncan Lewis commissioned an independent medical assessment. Dr Frank Arnold of Forrest Medico-Legal Services, a global specialist who helps document the experiences of victims of torture, visited Minh at Brook House. Afterwards, Arnold wrote a blistering report concluding that Minh\u2019s physical scars were consistent with a history of violent physical and sexual abuse, and that he was suffering from acute PTSD. He had, Arnold\u2019s report concluded, suffered considerably at the hands of both his traffickers and the UK government. \u201cDuring my time as anti-slavery commissioner, I saw child victims from Vietnam go through absolute hell,\u201d said Kevin Hyland, who worked at the Metropolitan police before becoming the UK\u2019s first anti-slavery commissioner in 2015, when the Modern Slavery Act was established. \u201cAnd then when they get pulled into our criminal justice system, it\u2019s as if they\u2019re entering this vast machine, where once you\u2019re inside it is almost impossible to change course. The Home Office ends up defending a position almost as if it\u2019s gone beyond the point where they can see people as human beings,\u201d he says. Other anti-trafficking experts have warned that many trafficking victims, who often have insecure immigration status, fell prey to the \u201chostile environment\u201d approach towards immigration adopted during Theresa May\u2019s time as home secretary. On the morning of 14 June 2017, Minh finally walked out of immigration detention and into a safe house arranged by the Salvation Army. It had been three years and eight months since he was escorted out of the cannabis house, imagining he had been rescued. * * * Meeting Minh today, it\u2019s hard to square the slight, softly spoken young man in his early 20s, in pressed blue jeans and trainers and tidy, gel-spiked hair, with the horrors that he has lived through. Yet often in our interviews his face slips, and you see the boy trapped among the plants in that airless, empty house six years ago. He says that after he was released from detention in 2017, he struggled to adapt. There were other young Vietnamese men in the safe house, but he sat in his room in a state of high anxiety thinking that someone was going to come and take him back to the detention centre. Rachel Thomas, a clinical psychologist specialising in complex mental health and trauma, was hired by Duncan Lewis to write a psychological assessment of Minh after he was released. Thomas has done similar assessments of scores of other trafficking victims, but vividly remembers her meetings with Minh at his safe house. She recalls him looking \u201csmall and slight and extremely young, much younger than his actual age, and very fragile\u201d. In her report, she writes: \u201cHis sleep is currently limited to about four hours a night. He is woken by nightmares about being attacked and chased. He is kept awake by intrusive memories of his experiences at the hands of his traffickers. They have become more intense and frequent since his detention, particuarly following the sexual abuse \u2026 during his stay at Morton Hall.\u201d During his assessment, Minh disclosed something he had also told Dr Frank Arnold: that after his failed escape from the cannabis house in Chesterfield, his traffickers had held him down, made a cut on his genitals and told him they had inserted a tracking device into his body. Thomas said that even if there was no tracking device, the psychological impact on the 16-year-old Minh had been immense: \u201cEven when he was in a safe place and had been recognised as a victim, he continued to believe that the traffickers were in ultimate control over his life,\u201d she says. After Minh\u2019s release from detention, Aydeed and the team at Duncan Lewis launched legal proceedings against both the Home Office and the Ministry of Justice for failing to protect Minh, and for failing to launch an investigation after the attempted rape at Morton Hall. Over the next 18 months, the team also pursued a separate judicial review against the Home Office. They argued that Minh was a victim of child trafficking, who had been systematically failed by the Home Office, which had criminalised and illegally detained their client over a four-year period, and then attempted to deport him back to Vietnam before a criminal investigation into his human trafficking had been concluded. For Minh, this battle for justice has been crucial in his own slow journey to some kind of recovery. \u201cAfter the incident at Morton Hall it was like I had split into two different people,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know who I am any more, but maybe there is a way to build a life for myself again. I used to talk a lot and laugh, and wanted to meet people and see things, but now I don\u2019t feel like that any more. When I look in the mirror, I see someone else there, someone I don\u2019t recognise, who is much older and who has been through awful things.\u201d Sometimes, he says, he finds it strange to walk the streets and be surrounded by people who have no idea what he has survived. \u201cSince I left detention I have always felt scared, especially when I thought about how I was trying to fight the police and the Home Office,\u201d he says. \u201cIt would be easier to just leave it alone. But I have to try my best to get justice, to take back my life. I have to trust that things can be better.\u201d In June 2018, Minh won his judicial review against the Home Office. The government accepts that it illegally detained him in prison, and then under immigration powers in Glen Parva and in immigration detention. When Minh heard the news, he felt the pressure lift for the first time in months. \u201cWhen they admitted that what had happened to me was wrong and I had been treated unjustly, I think I really understood for the first time none of this was my fault.\u201d Then, on a cold morning in November last year, Minh received an ecstatic message from the team at Duncan Lewis. A court of appeal had quashed his conviction for cannabis cultivation. He was no longer a criminal in the eyes of the UK authorities. For Minh, this felt like a rebirth. Ever since he had been released from immigration detention, he had been trying to relearn how to live in the world, just going about the normal business of cooking food and washing clothes and getting through the day. \u201cBut all the time, the fact that I was a criminal was there, it felt like a black mark on my forehead,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I have a bit of peace, now I can learn how to be a good person in this society, and maybe be of help, be a useful person.\u201d Last month, Minh won \u00a385,000 in compensation from the Home Office and the Ministry of Justice for the illegal detention and failure to protect him in immigration detention. When asked to comment on his case, a government spokesperson said: \u201cThe welfare of vulnerable detainees is of the utmost importance, and we are carefully considering the implications of this case. We have made significant improvements in recent years, but \u2026 we are committed to going further and faster in exploring alternatives to detention, increasing transparency around it and improving the support available for vulnerable detainees.\u201d The final battle to get Minh leave to remain in the UK will be concluded in the next few months. He is convinced that if he is sent back to Vietnam there is a high chance he will be trafficked again, or killed by the same gang who forced him into debt bondage as a teenager. It is far from certain that Minh will be allowed to stay. Despite talking itself up as a global leader in the fight against modern slavery, the Home Office only grants 12% of trafficking victims leave to remain. A recent investigation by Buzzfeed UK found that the government approved only 16 out of 326 applications made by children officially recognised as victims of slavery who had requested discretionary leave to remain between April 2017 and the end of 2018. But Aydeed remains positive, and Minh wants to stay and try and build a life for himself in the UK, despite everything that has happened to him here. For the first time, he is allowing himself to think about what he would like to do with the rest of his life. He is only 22. \u201cAll I can do is try to hope,\u201d he says. \u201cMy life didn\u2019t begin well, but that doesn\u2019t mean that it has to be like this for me any more.\u201d If you have come across someone who may be a victim of slavery, call the Salvation Army\u2019s confidential referral helpline on 0300 303 8151 \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

There was a chorus of \u201cS\u00ed\u201d, at least from the adults. Three of the four children in court dozed, slumped against their parents on the unforgiving wooden benches. They had been up for hours, having been summoned to a meeting point in Ju\u00e1rez at 4.30am. One five-year-old boy was lying on the carpet floor, softly singing as he played with a plastic water bottle. \u201cLet me ask it a different way,\u201d Mahtabfar said. \u201cIf anyone here is not afraid to return to Mexico, please raise your hand.\u201d No hands were raised. Most of the 16 people in court had made the long, frequently dangerous, journey from their homes in Central America, hoping to live in the United States. But upon arriving at the US-Mexico border, and attempting to apply for asylum, they had instead been ordered back across the Rio Grande River that forms the border here, to Ju\u00e1rez \u2013 one of the most dangerous cities in the world. This was the first hearing in a months-long process to determine whether they will be granted asylum in the US. It got off to an inauspicious start. The court\u2019s computer system was experiencing difficulties. After changing out the desktop computer at the judge\u2019s desk three times, the hearing was eventually switched to a different room. It was 10.30am, two hours behind schedule, before the session began. While they waited for a working computer, the people in court were kept under heavy security. To use the bathroom, each was escorted by security guards, there and back. They would be returned to Ju\u00e1rez immediately after the hearing. Their exile to wait in limbo in Mexico is the result of the Trump administration\u2019s controversial Remain in Mexico, or Migrant Protection Protocols policy, which has turned back tens of thousands of women, men and children since being introduced in March. With little money, these asylum seekers are forced to live in shelters, in abandoned properties or sometimes on the streets just south of the US border, in cities where immigrants have been sexually assaulted, kidnapped and murdered. On 17 July those in the court, a small, windowless room on the seventh floor of an austere building in downtown El Paso, were well aware of the danger in Ju\u00e1rez. Many were terrified of returning. One 24-year-old woman, wearing a grey T-shirt with her dark hair pulled back into a ponytail, sobbed as she pleaded with the judge to let her stay in the US. She was living in Ju\u00e1rez on her own, she said, and a group of men had been following her in recent days.

She, too, was in tears as she told the judge she was in danger in Mexico. \u201cI just wanted to tell you I have an affidavit from my family, who are American citizens,\u201d she said through the court translator. \u201cI am over here by myself in Mexico, and it is quite hard for me to be here by myself.\u201d Under Remain in Mexico, the judge told her: \u201cUnfortunately that is not possible.\u201d Both women were told they could have \u201ccredible fear\u201d interviews \u2013 essentially where a government official gauges how much danger they would be in if they returned to Mexico \u2013 but there were no guarantees. The interviews are not open to the press. The Guardian spent two days attending the El Paso federal immigration court, gaining an insight into the fear, confusion and, in some cases, incompetence, that the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies have led to on the US-Mexico border. Despite the well-documented, appalling conditions in some government detention centers north of the border, there was a stream of people pleading to taken into US custody. One woman, Mar\u00eda, said she was afraid to return to Ju\u00e1rez. Two men had been killed two blocks away from where she was staying. A Cuban man said five of his countrymen had been kidnapped in recent weeks. But some of the most harrowing stories coming to light were of the people who had not made it to court. On Wednesday, the attorney for a 19-year-old Honduran told Judge Nathan Herbert that the teenager was unable to make her court date because she had gone missing. The woman had attended court for her preliminary hearing on 22 May. She had told the judge she was afraid to return to Ju\u00e1rez, and was granted a credible fear interview. She was deemed not to be in danger, and was sent back to Mexico, with instructions to reappear in court in July. The 19-year-old has not been seen or heard from since. \u201cThe last contact was 22 May,\u201d immigration attorney John Moore said in court. Moore said the day she returned to Mexico was the last day she used WhatsApp, her primary mode of communication, and she never returned to the shelter where she had been staying. Despite hiring a private investigator, Moore had been unable to contact the sponsor the teenager had named in the US, or her family. The judge heard all this on Wednesday afternoon, then tried the 19-year-old\u2019s case in absentia anyway. She was refused entry to the US. Her bid for asylum was denied. In El Paso, where thousands of migrants have arrived in the past few months, few are able to find lawyers amid the chaos. Instead, many attempt to represent themselves \u2013 an almost impossible task, given that asylum application papers are legal documents that have to be filed in English, with supporting evidence also translated into English by a certified translator. Until recently, immigration advocates were allowed to speak to asylum seekers in court, before their cases are heard. They could explain what the hearing would entail \u2013 many migrants believe that on their first day in court they might be admitted to the US immediately, when in reality it is a months-long, arcane process \u2013 and advise them of their rights. But in an example of the on-the-hoof policy introduced in courts, that was abruptly stopped on 24 June. \u201cAll these people are at imminent risk of danger and I could be helping them with that, for free,\u201d said Taylor Levy, an immigration lawyer who was in court on Tuesday, and has previously represented immigrants in El Paso pro-bono. Levy said she was given no prior warning by court officials that she would no longer be able to talk to asylum seekers, until the day it happened. A week later, she was told she could no longer give out coloring books and crayons, something she had been doing for months to help occupy children while their parents pleaded their cases during the long hearings in court.

      "bodyText": "Eight members of the billionaire Sackler family who own Purdue Pharma, the maker of the controversial opioid prescription painkiller OxyContin, are being sued by multiple American cities, counties and states. Allegations in civil lawsuits include that \u201ceight people in a single family made the choices that caused much of the US opioid epidemic\u201d \u2013 via a \u201cdeadly, deceptive \u2026 illegal scheme\u201d. The family have long been lauded in philanthropy circles, and the Sackler name adorns top British and American museums, galleries and universities. But now their narcotics fortune, chiefly distributed via family foundations and trusts, is being shunned by a growing number of people, and despite strenuous denials of wrongdoing, their reputations and vast wealth are under threat. \u201cThey are responsible for addiction, overdose and death that damaged millions of lives,\u201d the Massachusetts attorney general, Maura Healey, has alleged in a ground-breaking lawsuit. Another massive lawsuit filed on behalf of 600 US cities and counties across 28 states coast to coast, and eight Native American tribes, alleges: \u201cThis nation is facing an unprecedented opioid addiction epidemic that was initiated and perpetuated by the Sackler defendants for their own financial gain.\u201d It adds that their Connecticut-based pharmaceutical firm Purdue Pharma \u201cinstructed patients and prescribers that signs of addiction are actually indications of untreated pain, such that the appropriate response is to prescribe even more opioids\u201d. The federal government reported there were 70,237 drug overdose deaths in the US in 2017. The death rate increased almost threefold from 1999 to 2017, and 130 people were dying daily from opioid-related overdoses. Who are the Sacklers under fire? Big picture: what are they accused of? According to various lawsuits, as owners and longtime directors of Purdue Pharma, the eight are accused of orchestrating and knowingly pushing deceptive practices at Purdue to boost sales of OxyContin while misleading prescribers and the public about the risks of addiction and death. They reaped profits while allegedly helping create \u201cthe worst drug crisis in American history,\u201d the Massachusetts state lawsuit says. It continues: \u201cThe Sacklers had the power to decide how addictive narcotics were sold. They hired hundreds of workers to carry out their wishes, and fired those who didn\u2019t sell enough drugs. They got more patients on opioids, at higher doses, for longer, than ever before [and] paid themselves billions.\u201d How much are they worth? The Sacklers reveal little. Forbes values this branch of the family at about $13bn. They own exclusive homes in London, New York, Beverly Hills and the Hamptons, and luxury estates in Connecticut, Texas and England. Who\u2019s suing them? Purdue Pharma is being sued by nearly every US state. And by almost 2,000 counties and cities gathered into a historic \u201cmulti-district litigation\u201d case in federal court in Cleveland, in which some of the complaints have been amended to include the family members alongside many corporate defendants, AKA \u201cbig pharma\u201d. The eight Sackler individuals are also being sued personally by Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Colorado and Connecticut. Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, West Virginia and Wisconsin are suing only Richard Sackler, and Utah is suing Richard and Kathe. The company and the family deny wrongdoing. What are the Sacklers saying? \u201cThese baseless allegations place blame where it does not belong for a complex public health crisis, and we deny them,\u201d the Mortimer and Raymond Sackler families have said in a statement. And they feel \u201cdeep and profound compassion\u201d for people struggling with addiction. Meanwhile, they are fighting the cases in court while also being involved in settlement talks. Key allegations All eight are accused collectively in lawsuits of: Directing Purdue Pharma aggressively to push deceptive OxyContin marketing materials to health care providers, aimed at getting \u201cmore and more patients on Purdue\u2019s drugs for longer and longer periods of time\u201d at high doses. Funding the Massachusetts General Hospital Purdue Pharma Pain Program and \u201can entire degree program\u201d at Tufts University in order, deceptively, \u201cto influence Massachusetts doctors to use its drugs\u201d. Additional allegations in lawsuits Against Richard, Jonathan, Kathe, Mortimer and Theresa Sackler: Some pill sales representatives reported to the above directors of Purdue their concerns that certain \u201ccore\u201d doctors were writing \u201cinappropriate\u201d prescriptions. But Purdue \u201cordered the reps to keep promoting opioids to these doctors anyway. Dozens of their patients overdosed and died.\u201d Against Richard, Jonathan, Kathe and Mortimer: In 1999, Richard Sackler became the chief executive of Purdue and Jonathan, Kathe, and Mortimer were vice-presidents when the company hired hundreds of sales representatives and \u201ctaught them false claims to use to sell drugs\u201d. Against Theresa alone: In May 2017, Purdue staff passed on advice that a reformulation of OxyContin was not a cost-effective way to prevent opioid abuse. \u201cTheresa Sackler asked staff what they were doing to fight back to convince doctors and patients to keep using the drug.\u201d She also served on the governance committee of Rhodes Pharma, a company owned by the Sacklers selling a generic version of OxyContin. Against Richard alone: At the launch party for OxyContin in 1996, Richard said the drug\u2019s debut \u201cwill be followed by a blizzard of prescriptions that will bury the competition.\u201d Amid increasing evidence of abuse of and addiction to the pills, Richard wrote in an email: \u201cWe have to hammer on the abusers in every way possible. They are the culprits and the problem. They are reckless criminals.\u201d In 2007 Richard applied for the patent and monopoly for a drug to treat opioid addiction, saying opioids are addictive, and referring to \u201cjunkies\u201d. Against Kathe alone: \u201cAs far back as the 1990s, Kathe Sackler knew that patients frequently suffer harm when high doses of an opioid are used for long periods of time.\u201d In 2014 Purdue discussed \u201cProject Tango\u201d, a secret plan to sell opioid addiction treatment, for profit. Kathe and staff \u201cwrote down what Purdue had publicly denied\u201d: that addictive opioids and opioid addiction are \u201cnaturally linked\u201d. They weighed becoming \u201can end-to-end provider\u201d. Project Tango never went ahead. Against Mortimer David Alfons Sackler alone: When Purdue sales projections showed OxyContin sales plateauing, \u201cMortimer demanded answers\u2026 about why sales would not grow.\u201d He believed the market \u201cshould grow\u201d, one lawsuit said. When Purdue staff at one point warned the Sacklers that prescribing was falling short of expectations and the family\u2019s quarterly payout from sales could fall from $320m to $260m, Mortimer \u201csharply objected and demanded answers from staff\u201d. Where do the cases go from here? The first trial in any of the cases where the Sacklers personally are being sued by US local or state government is likely to be in spring 2020 in a case involving New York state and most of the state\u2019s cities and counties and led by Suffolk county. The year 2019 emerged as a year of reckoning for the US opioid industry that had allegedly been gorging on profits: plaintiffs against the eight Sacklers multiplied; Purdue Pharma settled a case brought by Oklahoma, and the Sacklers personally contributed $75m despite not being defendants; another corporate defendant in that case, Johnson &amp; Johnson, went to trial; Insys became the first opioid maker to declare bankruptcy after bosses were convicted in criminal court; long-secret documents in the pivotal case in Ohio revealed in July how the industry deluged an unprepared American public with dangerous pain pills. Amid settlement talks, the Ohio case \u2013 the biggest civil trial in US history \u2013 will see the first of a series of trials begin in October. Past criminal case Purdue Pharma was prosecuted in federal court in 2007 and fined $600m for crimes involving misleading regulators, doctors and patients about the dangers of OxyContin. The Sacklers weren\u2019t charged, but one lawsuit notes: \u201cThe Sackler defendants voted to enter into a plea agreement that stated: \u2018Purdue is pleading guilty as described above because Purdue is in fact guilty.\u2019\u201d Leading institutions given money by eight Sacklers or via their charitable organisations Arts US Metropolitan Museum*, Guggenheim Museum*, Dia Art Foundation; Metropolitan Opera.

      "bodyText": "A group of young great white sharks has taken up residence along the central coast of California, enthralling beachgoers, residents, local media outlets and scientists. Marine biologists are working to understand why the sharks \u2013 the largest predatory fish in the world \u2013 have ventured up to California\u2019s Monterey Bay. The juvenile great whites typically reside in the balmy waters of southern California, near the US-Mexico border. But the fish have increasingly wandered north in the past few years, leading to frequent sightings in the Monterey Bay since 2014. Scientists suspect the warming temperatures of the ocean may play a role in the sharks surprising movements. \u201cWhite sharks are endotherms \u2013 they have a warmer internal temperature, which makes them more like mammals than fish,\u201d said Sal Jorgensen, a senior research scientist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium who studies white sharks in the Pacific Ocean. \u201cEspecially when they\u2019re first born, they have to stay in a Goldilocks temperature range that\u2019s not too hot and not too cold.\u201d Along with researchers at local universities, Jorgensen has been working to tag and track the white sharks, to better understand how these large, ancient marine predators are coping with a changing climate. He said warming ocean temperatures \u2013 driven by the climate crisis \u2013 could have attracted the sharks to regions that were previously too cold for comfort. Starting in 2013, a curious mass of warm water that scientists call \u201cthe Blob\u201d moved through the Pacific, triggering ripple effects throughout marine ecosystems. Years of El Ni\u00f1o that followed kept surface temperatures warm and likely tempted the sharks to stay on even longer \u2013 especially in a pocket of warmth near the famed surfing beaches of Santa Cruz, California. An abundance of fish likely kept the young predators well-fed and content. \u201cAnd we know that these sharks really imprint on an area,\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cOnce they have a favorite hunting area they return to that same spot year after year for decades.\u201d Fully matured sharks, who annually migrate 1,200 miles offshore to what\u2019s known as the White Shark Caf\u00e9, return to their coastal birthplaces in order to have children of their own. Jorgensen said he and other researchers are still working to confirm their hypotheses about how changing conditions are affecting shark behavior. They plan to closely watch the Monterey white sharks in the coming years and see if they\u2019ll stick around. \u201cIt is possible that this area could become a new birthing area,\u201d he said. The group of juveniles currently hunting in Monterey Bay has sparked a number of shark warnings. Local media outlets have sent reporters up in helicopters to document the group\u2019s movements. And tour boat companies are starting to offer shark-watching trips. \u201cI think there\u2019s this little kid inside a lot of us that gets so excited at the thought of seeing a real-life great white,\u201d said Megan Petersen, a naturalist who conducts tours for a charter boat company called Santa Cruz Whale Watching. \u201cIt seems like some of them are really curious about our boats \u2013 so they\u2019ll swim right up to the boat, just a few feet away,\u201d added Petersen, who started leading white shark expeditions earlier this month. \u201cThey\u2019re just breathtaking.\u201d Experts say the group poses little danger to humans. Adult white sharks, which can grow up to 20ft long, are apex predators that hunt marine mammals like sea lions and seals. Juveniles are less than half as big and feed exclusively on smaller fish and squid. \u201cSo they\u2019re generally not a threat to humans, and they\u2019re pretty docile,\u201d Petersen said. In fact, great whites are have been suffering from a major image problem, said Taylor Chapple, a marine biologist at Stanford University who in addition to researching sharks has been working to rehabilitate their reputation of being mindless killers. \u201cIn my mind, they\u2019re more majestic than scary,\u201d Chapple said. \u201cThey\u2019re sort of like those giant dog breeds \u2013 like Great Danes or something \u2013 they just saunter around the ocean. It\u2019s like they know their place in the world. They know what they\u2019re doing.\u201d Sharks have been roaming the seas for hundreds of millions of years, notes Jorgensen. \u201cWhen I began to realize that they are no longer the top predators \u2013 that humans are endangering them, even though we\u2019ve been on this earth for just a tiny flash of time, I felt I had to do something to understand them better and help them survive.\u201d It\u2019s not uncommon for the giant fish \u2013 which can live up to 70 years or more \u2013 to get tangled in fishing nets, or poached for their valuable fins. Overfishing could deplete their food sources and ocean pollution imperils their habitats. Various protections enacted since the mid-1990s in California have helped local white shark populations thrive, though scientists are still working out precise population sizes and trends. A 2011 study estimated that 219 adult great whites lived off the central California coast. The species is categorized as \u201cvulnerable\u201d on the IUCN Red List. \u201cI\u2019m cautiously optimistic that thanks to bans on net fishing, and other protections, their numbers are increasing,\u201d Jorgensen said. \u201cBut we know much less about what happens once they leave our sanctuaries.\u201d",

This week, the News Corp-owned cable TV company announced a partnership with the US on-demand streaming monolith under which Netflix access will be integrated into a new Foxtel subscription package. This will give new and renewing customers to the sport and drama package an initial six months of Netflix access for free, and will be incorporated into a new and apparently simplified user interface through its set-top box, to be rolled out over the coming months. <br><br>The dying gasps of a dinosaur content provider? Possibly. <a href=\"http://www.roymorgan.com/findings/8067-foxtel-netflix-pay-tv-subscription-tv-july-2019-201907230815\">Roy Morgan research this week</a> showed that 11.5 million Australians now have access to a Netflix subscription, while 5 million subscribe to Foxtel, and that the overlap between the two is 3 million people.</p> <h2>Lessons from Christchurch</h2> <p>The Australian Communications and Media Authority\u2019s final report on the broadcast of the Christchurch shooter\u2019s GoPro footage in news reports on the day of the terrorist attack, as expected, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jul/12/no-media-penalty-over-christchurch-shootings-live-stream-watchdog-suggests\">did not reprimand broadcasters</a> for airing the footage. But the final report did reveal a few interesting defences from the broadcasters who aired footage or still images from the attack.</p> <p>The ABC broadcast still images from the bodycam, with none including any images of victims. SBS showed excerpts from the footage including victims being shot at (but no gunshots could be seen hitting any victims).</p> <p>In footage on Seven, Nine, Ten and Sky News, Acma found that viewers could have understood that the people on screen had been shot but no footage of people being hit by gunfire was broadcast.</p> <p>In Sky News\u2019 defence, Foxtel said the footage had been used sparingly, and that it would not have been distressing for a substantial number of its viewers because most of them were adults. According to OzTam data provided to Acma, 84.7% of the channel\u2019s audience is aged over 55.</p> <p>Foxtel argued that the broadcast was in the public interest because of the public safety issues, the way social media platforms were used to broadcast such attacks, and to show \u201cthe presence of rightwing extremist activity in New Zealand and Australia\u201d.</p> <p>Similarly, Seven argued that 90% of its audience for the news was aged over 18. It said the footage had been carefully selected and was in the public interest.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that the attack was perpetrated on the basis of religious hate and intolerance also contributed strongly to the public interest element,\u201d it said. \u201cMuch debate in Australia is currently focused on whether the broader community is too tolerant of hate speech or is insufficiently alert to the dangers presented by rightwing organisations. The Christchurch terrorist attack engaged directly with these significant and profound cultural issues.\u201d</p> <p> Acma has said it will now consult television broadcasters about potential revisions to the code covering the broadcast of user-generated content, repetition of distressing footage and vision warnings.</p> <h2><strong>Are you sitting comfortably?</strong></h2> <p>ABC staff received a terse memo from management this week after listeners were greeted with dead air during news broadcasts four times during the weekend.</p> <p>In the memo to ABC Radio staff this week, newsreaders were asked to \u201censure they are sitting comfortable and relaxed\u201d in the chair \u201cwell before they go to air\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe had the ignominious situation over Friday and the weekend of four bulletins being missed by Radio News presenters,\u201d the memo stated. \u201cIn each case human error was to blame.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/24/the-attacks-on-bob-brown-for-opposing-a-windfarm-are-exhausting-and-hypocritical\">The attacks on Bob Brown for opposing a windfarm are exhausting and hypocritical | Richard Denniss</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cReaders should ensure they are sitting comfortable and relaxed in their studios well before they go to air, and their desk is set to their requirements.</p> <p>\u201cNews and the networks consider bulletins being missed, causing dead air, to be a very serious issue.

While Anderson\u2019s salary is not yet publicly available, in the 2017-18 financial year the previous MD, Michelle Guthrie, had a total remuneration package of $963,991 (according to the latest ABC annual report). A 2% rise on that figure would have been $19,280. For contrast, the prime minister of Australia\u2019s salary is $549, 000. In the 2017-18 financial year ABC executives took home $2m in bonuses, with one executive receiving a one-off $232,500. In June, Anderson disclosed to an all-staff meeting that that executive had been him. Last year, when he was on the board but not MD, his total remuneration package was $508,891. Anderson\u2019s near-$1m remuneration package was scheduled to rise under a decision by the remuneration tribunal, which decides the wages of top public servants. But he said he \u201cdid not think it appropriate\u201d, given that he has been in the role only for about three months. Strokes of hypocrisy Australian swimmer Mack Horton\u2019s podium protest against his Chinese rival Sun Yang touched off a local spat, after the Nine sports reporter Andrew Wu pointed out the alleged hypocrisy of praising an Australian for his anti-drugs stance while ignoring offences closer to home. The Australian picked up Wu\u2019s comment on the \u201csocial media platform Twitter\u201d (thanks for explaining) and the largely hostile response it received, implying it may have breached Nine\u2019s policy on what staff can and cannot say on social media. Wu followed up with a scathing piece in the SMH about the excuses Australia has made in the past for our own drug infractions (\u201cMy mum gave it to me. My coach gave it to me for a headache. We were told it was OK\u201d). But by Thursday, the Oz seemed to have had a change of heart, running an exclusive interview on the front page with Sun\u2019s \u201cAussie coach\u201d, Dennis Cotterell, lambasting the \u201chypocritical\u201d response from Australian swimmers to Horton\u2019s protest. Good that we can all agree there has been a good deal of hypocrisy in this case. If you can\u2019t beat them \u2026 Foxtel has revealed a plan to stop the haemorrhaging of subscribers to Netflix by awkwardly embracing the rival streaming service. This week, the News Corp-owned cable TV company announced a partnership with the US on-demand streaming monolith under which Netflix access will be integrated into a new Foxtel subscription package. This will give new and renewing customers to the sport and drama package an initial six months of Netflix access for free, and will be incorporated into a new and apparently simplified user interface through its set-top box, to be rolled out over the coming months. The dying gasps of a dinosaur content provider? Possibly. Roy Morgan research this week showed that 11.5 million Australians now have access to a Netflix subscription, while 5 million subscribe to Foxtel, and that the overlap between the two is 3 million people. Lessons from Christchurch The Australian Communications and Media Authority\u2019s final report on the broadcast of the Christchurch shooter\u2019s GoPro footage in news reports on the day of the terrorist attack, as expected, did not reprimand broadcasters for airing the footage. But the final report did reveal a few interesting defences from the broadcasters who aired footage or still images from the attack. The ABC broadcast still images from the bodycam, with none including any images of victims. SBS showed excerpts from the footage including victims being shot at (but no gunshots could be seen hitting any victims). In footage on Seven, Nine, Ten and Sky News, Acma found that viewers could have understood that the people on screen had been shot but no footage of people being hit by gunfire was broadcast. In Sky News\u2019 defence, Foxtel said the footage had been used sparingly, and that it would not have been distressing for a substantial number of its viewers because most of them were adults. According to OzTam data provided to Acma, 84.7% of the channel\u2019s audience is aged over 55. Foxtel argued that the broadcast was in the public interest because of the public safety issues, the way social media platforms were used to broadcast such attacks, and to show \u201cthe presence of rightwing extremist activity in New Zealand and Australia\u201d. Similarly, Seven argued that 90% of its audience for the news was aged over 18. It said the footage had been carefully selected and was in the public interest. \u201cThe fact that the attack was perpetrated on the basis of religious hate and intolerance also contributed strongly to the public interest element,\u201d it said. \u201cMuch debate in Australia is currently focused on whether the broader community is too tolerant of hate speech or is insufficiently alert to the dangers presented by rightwing organisations. The Christchurch terrorist attack engaged directly with these significant and profound cultural issues.\u201d Acma has said it will now consult television broadcasters about potential revisions to the code covering the broadcast of user-generated content, repetition of distressing footage and vision warnings. Are you sitting comfortably? ABC staff received a terse memo from management this week after listeners were greeted with dead air during news broadcasts four times during the weekend. In the memo to ABC Radio staff this week, newsreaders were asked to \u201censure they are sitting comfortable and relaxed\u201d in the chair \u201cwell before they go to air\u201d. \u201cWe had the ignominious situation over Friday and the weekend of four bulletins being missed by Radio News presenters,\u201d the memo stated. \u201cIn each case human error was to blame. \u201cReaders should ensure they are sitting comfortable and relaxed in their studios well before they go to air, and their desk is set to their requirements. \u201cNews and the networks consider bulletins being missed, causing dead air, to be a very serious issue. Make sure you\u2019re on top of it and avoid a problem.\u201d Believe the hype? When Nine announced its purchase of Fairfax last year, there were a lot of questions about how the marriage between two very different cultures would work. How would a flashy, ratings-obsessed commercial network gel with the more staid newsrooms at the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age? Would we see Kate McClymont on A Current Affair? Would Adele Ferguson be announced as the new host of The Block? Well, we\u2019re about to see the fruits of what is being teased as a blockbuster collaboration, with a joint investigation between Nine\u2019s flagship current affairs program 60 Minutes and the two newspapers airing this Sunday. In classic 60 Minutes fashion, they\u2019re not underselling the yarn. The promo, released online this week, promises that a \u201cmajor investigation\u201d is set to \u201crock the foundations of Australia\u201d. \u201cThree major organisations have uncovered a story so big it can\u2019t be missed.\u201d You wouldn\u2019t want to under-deliver on that sizzle.

The final report from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission on its 18-month inquiry into the impact of Google, Facebook and other platforms in Australia was released by the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, and the communications minister, Paul Fletcher, on Friday. The report makes 23 recommendations to force more regulation on Google and Facebook, and to improve media competition. A new digital platforms division of the ACCC would have responsibility to \u201clift the veil\u201d on the advertising markets and algorithms used by Facebook and Google, Frydenberg said. The division would be able to hold public inquiries covering five years and to compel companies to provide relevant information, the report said. ACCC chair Rod Sims told Guardian Australia the regulator was already well equipped to take on the work. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a tonne of expertise,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need PhDs in information technology, we recruit graduates from all fields and they have the ability to get right stuck into this. \u201cIf we need specialist help, we\u2019ll go get it.\u201d The inquiries would look at the supply of ad services, whether there is sufficient transparency over the prices charged, and whether there is enough competition in the market. The platforms will also be required to develop a code of conduct to ensure news businesses are treated fairly and transparently, and given early notifications about changes to news ranking.

The Privacy Act should be updated to give users greater control over their personal information, the ability to move the data from one company to another, to have the data destroyed, and to require greater levels of consent from users before personal information is collected, the report recommended. \u201cThere is no option other than to put in place the right regulatory and legislative regime to protect the public\u2019s privacy,\u201d Frydenberg said on Friday. \u201cWhat this report finds is that so much personal data is being collected without informed consent.\u201d Facebook was fined US$5bn ($7.2bn) this week for deceiving users over their ability to keep their data private, after the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The report also recommended the government implement the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission and introduce a statutory tort for serious invasions of privacy. Other recommendations include taxpayer funding for local journalism and media literacy organisations, and making donations to not-for-profit organisations engaging in public-interest journalism tax-deductible. The report did not call for the big tech companies to be broken up, but did recommend changes to merger law to force the companies to inform the ACCC about the impact future mergers would have on competition. Sims said this was to ensure that focus would be on meaningful changes in the immediate future. \u201cIf your dominant recommendation is break-up then all the focus is on that break-up. We want the focus to be on all the harms we have identified,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe that can work and be much more effective, than putting them off to the never-never while you wait five years for a break-up.\u201d He said even if, for example, Instagram and WhatsApp were broken up from Facebook, that there was no guarantee that those companies wouldn\u2019t then dominate their own markets. Sims said, however, that the report was the \u201cstart of a journey\u201d and divestment could not be ruled out in the future. Frydenberg said on Friday the government accepted the \u201coverriding conclusion\u201d of the report that reform was needed \u201cto better protect consumers, improve transparency, recognise power imbalances and ensure that substantial market power is not used to lessen competition in media and advertising services markets\u201d. He said the companies would have 12 weeks to respond to the report before the government did so. Google and Facebook\u2019s digital industry association has called for the recommendations to be run against an \u201cinnovation test\u201d to see how it would affect investment in technology and digital industry in Australia. \u201cWe\u2019re closely reviewing these recommendations to ensure they don\u2019t bring unintended consequences to all digital businesses and the choice of digital products available to Australian consumers,\u201d Digi managing director Sunita Bose said. \u201cA thriving technology sector means having large and small, local and global companies all alongside each other, creating an ecosystem where the calibre of employees, business opportunities and the choice of digital services available to Australians all increase.\u201d Sims said in response that innovation was not the dominant goal of the ACCC\u2019s report. \u201cIf your starting position is it is innovation first and all other considerations second, you are going to end up with a hell of a mess. \u201cOur judgement is if consumer privacy is getting invaded, then that is ultimately going to undermine innovation because consumers will withdraw from this world.\u201d The government plans to respond to the report in full by the end of this year. In the meantime, the ACCC plans to pursue Google and Facebook for potential breaches under Australian consumer and competition laws using its existing powers, Sims said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got five active investigations underway, which we will be pursuing.\u201d This could include cases brought against the tech giants by companies working within the Facebook or Google ecosystem that the platforms have taken action against. One of the cases the ACCC is currently investigating is the collapse of Australian startup Unlockd after Google threatened to remove the company from its app store for violating its terms of use. While a court injunction was granted to prevent the company being kicked off at the time, the news of the fight with Google made it difficult for the company to raise capital from investors, which the company claims led to its demise.

      "bodyText": "The previous day\u2019s rain has sweetened the track up to the old quarry, pink geraniums glowing from the green shade of saplings, but suddenly to my left is the gaping white hole in the dale\u2019s jaw: a pulled tooth of profit. Even so, these old workings, crude and ugly, are being gently colonised. A rock climber is making her elegant way, like a bronzed spider, up the white wall. And above her head, where the land lies back, are a few marginal acres, behind-the-sofa country, where nature has room to take her ease and stretch out a little. I follow the easy path to get there, round the side. The roar of traffic in the dale is replaced by the buzzy drone of insects working the drift of flowers reclaiming the mangled hillside: orchids, lady\u2019s bedstraw and marjoram, whose aromatic leaves I crush under my nose, red clover and St John\u2019s wort, willowherb, wild thyme, a patch of eyebright, and the dignified purple of meadow cranesbill. A carder bee, gingery in the sunshine, clings to the yellow folds of a bird\u2019s foot trefoil. There\u2019s a clump of musk mallow, the pale pink flowers at their best, freshly vibrant and delicate. One patch of ground, close to the quarry\u2019s boundary, is sheltered on three sides and, when I barge in, a cloud of meadow brown butterflies lifts into the air, scattering anxiously. Delighted, and a little ashamed, I then notice bright orange specks massing on the white flowers of a hogweed. These are common red soldier beetles (Rhagonycha fulva), a centimetre long with black antennae and a dark brown band at the tail, and they are doing what adult red soldier beetles mostly do for their short lives, which span the months of summer: copulating. Hence their popular name, the hogweed bonking beetle. Through a magnifying glass they become huge, like monsters. I notice the male\u2019s vast abdomen arched over the female beneath him. Then, in unison, their two heads swivel towards me and their antennae waggle, like disapproving eyebrows, as though to say: \u201cDo you mind?\u201d So I withdraw and leave the beetles and the butterflies to their hours in the sun.",

In February 2018 after meeting Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s husband, Richard Ratcliffe, Johnson\u2019s team briefed to the Sun that the owed money would be handed over to Iran, but disagreements in Whitehall meant it did not happen. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, is understood to have been so furious about the non-payment of the money and what he regarded as Foreign Office double dealing that it is claimed he washed his hands of the Zaghari-Ratcliffe case. Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s supporters say the briefing to the Sun was more damaging to her chances of release than Johnson\u2019s better-known mistake when he said she had been training journalists at the time of her arrest in Tehran. Her family say she was there on holiday. Supporters including her MP, Tulip Siddiq, have raised questions about the scale of the legal fees the UK is racking up in the debt dispute. The Ministry of Defence has supplied answers to Siddiq suggesting that the legal costs over 40 years were between \u00a332m and \u00a341m. Ministers argue that sanctions against Iran have to be respected whatever the diplomatic gains from handing over the money. The latest court case was about whether the MoD should pay interest on the debt accumulated in the period after the Iranian body to which the money is owed became subject to EU sanctions. The Sunday Times successfully applied for a secrecy order on the case to be lifted. The initial dispute centred on a 1970s defence deal between the Iranian defence ministry and International Military Services (IMS), a venture wholly owned by the MoD. IMS agreed a deal in 1971 to sell the shah of Iran more than 1,500 Chieftain tanks and armoured vehicles. The contracts were cancelled in February 1979 after the shah was deposed in a revolution. Iran had already paid for the undelivered tanks and demanded its money back.",

This is the latest in a series of pledges by banks and financial services companies that they will not support projects that mine or burn coal used for electricity generation, in line with the goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Activists said Suncorp\u2019s announcement meant there were now no Australian insurers willing to underwrite new thermal coal developments. Suncorp, which owns insurance brands AAMI and GIO, made headlines in February when it announced its half-year profit had slumped 45%, mainly because of extreme weather events in Sydney and Queensland. Its then chief executive, Michael Cameron, called on the government to make it compulsory for Australian businesses to adopt climate change action plans to prepare for natural disasters. In a statement on Friday, the $17bn company said climate change posed a financial and strategic risk but was also an opportunity. It said it had applied a shadow carbon price, assuming greenhouse gas emissions have a cost, to its investment decisions since 2017 and had recently expanded that across all its operations. \u201cThe practical outcome of this is that we have materially reduced our investment in fossil fuels, including thermal coal,\u201d an official said. \u201cWe will seek to increase exposure to businesses that have a positive environmental impact, including renewable energy generation and technology.\u201d Suncorp\u2019s competitor QBE said in March it would no longer insure new thermal coal projects and would stop underwriting existing operations from 2030. Market Forces, an activist group affiliated with Friends of the Earth, lodged a shareholder resolution this week asking Suncorp to set targets for phasing out all fossil fuels, including coal, oil and gas. Campaigner Pablo Brait said the company\u2019s announcement was significant. \u201cAny company wanting to run a coal-burning power station past 2030 will now be unable to get an Australian insurer to back it. [Energy companies] AGL and Origin might want to take note,\u201d he said. Brait called on Suncorp to go further. \u201cWithout action on oil and gas there is a risk that Suncorp ends up trading one massive climate risk for another over time,\u201d he said. Suncorp said in February its experience with extreme events had prompted it to increase its annual allowance for natural hazards by $100m and to buy another $200m of reinsurance cover. Market Forces said claims to Suncorp for flood, fire and cyclone damage had been $1.7bn more than the group had budgeted for over the past decade.",

      "bodyText": "The House passed a two-year budget deal negotiated by speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Trump supported the deal, but many Republicans opposed it. Trump once again called for rapper A$AP Rocky\u2019s release and criticized the Swedish prime minister for failing to intervene in the case. Despite Mueller\u2019s warning about ongoing Russian election interference, Senate Republicans have blocked a series of election security bills since the special counsel testified. Mitch McConnell argued that the bills were too partisan and that addressing election security must engage both parties. But Democrats slammed him for his inaction as the 2020 election looms. A few Democrats have come out in favor of impeachment since Mueller\u2019s testimony. But Nancy Pelosi has still shown no signs of backing an inquiry. Democratic presidential candidates slammed the Trump administration\u2019s decision to resume capital punishment after a 16-year lapse of the policy. The House oversight panel voted along party lines to authorize subpoenas of the Trump administration\u2019s nonofficial communications. And to cap off our day, a story about congresswoman Frederica Wilson of Florida, whose signature looks include an array of wonderfully colorful hats. Wilson is reconsidering her trademark style, according to The Miami Herald. Fear, not fashion, is the reason. Wilson, a 76-year-old Miami-Dade Democrat serving her fourth term in the House of Representatives, said she made the decision after an unsettling phone call to her homefollowing her visit \u2014 as part of a Democratic delegation that included Georgia Rep. John Lewis \u2014 to the Homestead detention center, where more than 1,300 undocumented migrant children are being held... The caller, she said, argued that the Border Patrol page was protected under the First Amendment and while he didn\u2019t directly threaten her, suggested that her hats made her easy to find. Wilson, subject of a not-so-subtle threat in late June, said she was shaken. She said from now on, whether she wears a hat or not will be dictated by the event and whether she\u2019s in a public setting or not. The caller\u2019s number was reportedly provided to the police, though no arrests have been made. Here\u2019s hoping the threats abate so when Congress is back in session in September, Wilson can return to the House floor in full style. Candidates and activists who have long been campaigning for a presidential debate centered around the climate crisis will be getting somewhat what they want. A Climate Forum on September 19 and 20 will be open to 2020 presidential candidates from both parties. The event will be hosted by Georgetown University\u2019s Institute of Politics and Public Service, in partnership with MSNBC and environmental news outlet Our Daily Planet. CNN will also be holding a Democratic town hall focused on the climate crisis a few days earlier, on September 4. Following the first Democratic debate in June, activists camped out in front of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s headquarters to demand a separate debate focused solely on climate change, complaining that fewer than 10 minutes of each two-hour debate were dedicated to discussing climate. Several journalists, including The Guardian\u2019s Emily Holden, agreed. DNC Chair Tom Perez has forbidden an official debate centered on climate change (though \u201cforums\u201d or a \u201ctown halls\u201d are be allowed), arguing that such a debate would favor candidates like Washington governor Jay Inslee, whose entire campaign is built around environmental issues. Billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer announced his detailed plan to address climate change today, as did senator Kirsten Gillibrand. Several other 2020 Democratic candidates, including Beto O\u2019Rourke, Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg and others have also released detailed plans. Other candidates, including Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, as well as Warren and Gillibrand are co-sponsors of the Green New Deal. The majority of candidates support the deal. Members of the House of Representatives wrapped up for six-week summer recess, a day earlier than originally scheduled, after a packed week that included the Mueller hearings yesterday and the passing of a budget deal today. Yet another Democratic representative \u2013 Katherine Clark of Massachusetts \u2013 came out in support of impeaching Trump. Clark is the vice chair of the House Democratic caucus. The Senate voted to approve Trump\u2019s pick to be the next chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Mark Milley. Milley is currently the chief of staff of the army. In his new position, he will serve as the top military adviser to the president. He will replace Joseph Dunford, who is retiring in the fall. Donald Trump is once again advocating for the rapper A$AP Rocky, who was charged with assault over a fight in Stockholm last month and has been held in custody since July 3. Swedish Prime Minister Stefan L\u00f6fven\u2019s office, in response to earlier entreaties by Trump to release the musician, said in a statement that he would not intervene in the case, noting that \u201cin Sweden everyone is equal before the law\u201d. A$AP Rocky, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, has insisted that he acted in self-defense. He posted videos on Instagram purporting to show the lead up to the confrontations, with two men who appear to be following the rapper and then attacking his security guard. Celebrities including Kim Kardashian West and Justin Bieber have rallied behind the rapper, with Kardashian West directly appealing to Trump to help free Mayers. Following the passage of the budget deal, Congress voted on an amendment, offered by Republican congressman Thomas Massie of Kentucky to change the title of the bill to read \u201cA bill to kick the can down the road, and for other purposes.\u201d It did not pass. The budget deal negotiated by the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, passed, 284-149. Sixty-five Republicans voted for the Trump-backed deal, and 132 voted against it. Some fiscally conservative Republican lawmakers balked at the deal, which raises spending by $320bn without a clear plan for reining in deficit or debt. But Democrats are celebrating the deal as a sign that the left and right can work together and compromise in order to stave off a government shutdown and prevent the country from defaulting on its debt. That\u2019s it from me today. I\u2019m turning the blog over to Maanvi Singh on the West Coast. Here is where the day stands so far. Despite Mueller\u2019s warning about ongoing Russian election interference, Senate Republican have blocked a series of election security bills since the special counsel testified. Mitch McConnell argued that the bills were too partisan and that addressing election security must engage both parties. But Democrats slammed him for his inaction as the 2020 election looms. A few Democrats have come out in favor of impeachment since Mueller\u2019s testimony. But Nancy Pelosi has still shown no signs of backing an inquiry. Democratic presidential candidates slammed the Trump administration\u2019s decision to resume capital punishment after a 16-year lapse of the policy. The House oversight panel voted along party lines to authorize subpoenas of the Trump administration\u2019s nonofficial communications. And the vote is underway now for the budget deal negotiated between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Pelosi. So stay tuned. The pro-Trump Republican looking to unseat representative Ilhan Omar is facing a felony charge for allegedly stealing from stores. Our colleague Jon Swaine reports: Danielle Stella was arrested twice this year in Minneapolis suburbs over allegations that she shoplifted items worth more than $2,300 from a Target and goods valued at $40 from a grocery store. ... In a series of text messages, Stella said: \u2018I am not guilty of these crimes. In this country I am innocent until proven guilty and that is the law.\u2019 She added: \u2018If I was guilty of crimes, I would never run for public office, putting myself in the public eye under a microscope to be attacked by all political sides.\u2019 ... She has accused Omar of being a criminal for advising immigrants how to avoid agents from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She said in a tweet that any representatives who fail to \u2018uphold the rule of law\u2019 should be ejected from office. Bill de Blasio responded in a pretty eye-popping way to Trump\u2019s accusation that the New York mayor and presidential candidate was not standing up for the city\u2019s police officers. Trump was reacting to viral videos that have emerged showing police officers getting doused with water as they respond to calls in the city. The president called on de Blasio to \u201cact immediately\u201d to the \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d behavior. De Blasio responded by noting that New York\u2019s crime rate has declined in recent years before making a jab about Trump\u2019s own record. Another Democratic presidential candidate, Amy Klobuchar, has put out a statement criticizing the Trump administration\u2019s decision to resume capital punishment after a 16-year lapse. \u201cI have opposed the death penalty from back in my time as a prosecutor,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cIt does not reduce crime, it is costly and it is discriminatory. ... I disagree with the president\u2019s decision.\u201d Fellow candidate Bernie Sanders earlier responded to the news by calling for abolishing the death penalty. \u201cThere\u2019s enough violence in the world,\u201d Sanders wrote on Twitter. \u201cThe government shouldn\u2019t add to it. When I am president, we will abolish the death penalty.\u201d It isn\u2019t just Russia: Twitter has shut down more than 7,000 phony accounts from Iran this year alone. Researchers say America is likely to see more foreign disinformation in the 2020 elections than ever before, as additional countries launch campaigns to influence the US electorate. The Washington Post reports: A short list of countries that host online influence operations with a history of meddling across borders includes Saudi Arabia, Israel, China, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela, researchers say. They say it\u2019s not often not clear exactly who runs these operations \u2014 whether it\u2019s the governments themselves or some other actors \u2014 but they typically echo the talking points of the ruling powers and back their geopolitical goals through tweets, posts and online videos. ... The influence operations in these countries, however, do not all share Russia\u2019s demonstrated preference for Trump and other Republicans. The Iranians, for example, typically oppose Trump in their disinformation messaging, criticizing his decision to pull the United States out of the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and administration policy on other issues, including Israel and the civil wars in Yemen and Syria, research shows. Another Democrat, representative Peter DeFazio, announced his support for launching an impeachment inquiry against Trump. \u201cI believe that the time has come for the Judiciary Committee to open a formal impeachment inquiry and collect the evidence necessary to build a strong case against President Trump,\u201d DeFazio said in a statement. \u201cHis presidency is a danger to our national security and a threat to our democracy.\u201d DeFazio\u2019s announcement brings the total number of House members supporting impeachment up to 95, according to a CNN count. The Oregon congressman is also the second Democrat, after Lori Trahan of Massachusetts, to back impeachment after special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s testimony. The confirmation process for Air Force general John E. Hyten to become the next vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff will advance despite sexual misconduct allegations against him. Hyten was nominated to become the military\u2019s No. 2 officer in April, but an Army colonel alleges he repeatedly made sexually abusive contact with her. Jim Inhofe, the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Hyten\u2019s confirmation hearing could occur as soon as next week. Inhofe met with Hyten today to discuss the allegations, which he denies. Members of the committee have also previously met with Hyten\u2019s accuser, and questions about her allegations are sure to dominate the hearing. Senate Republicans have twice blocked legislation aimed at strengthening US election security in the 24 hours since special counsel Robert Mueller warned that Russian election interference remains ongoing. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a single attempt. They\u2019re doing it as we sit here,\u201d Mueller said of Russia\u2019s efforts during his congressional testimony yesterday. \u201cAnd they expect to do it during the next campaign.\u201d But since he left the witness stand, Republican senators have blocked a House-backed bill and a separate trio of bills meant to beef up US election security. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell criticized the House bill as \u201cso partisan it received just one Republican vote over in the House,\u201d asserting that any election security proposal must be bipartisan. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer fired back against McConnell by accusing Republicans of having \u201cburied commonsense election security bills in their legislative graveyard.\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard is suing Google, accusing the search engine giant of stifling her free speech by briefly suspending her campaign\u2019s advertising account. The Hawaii congresswoman is seeking an injunction against Google, as well as damages of at least $50 million. Gabbard\u2019s complaints about the suspension seemed to eerily echo accusations from Republicans that Google discriminates against conservative voices. \u201cGoogle\u2019s discriminatory actions against my campaign are reflective of how dangerous their complete dominance over internet search is, and how the increasing dominance of big tech companies over our public discourse threatens our core American values,\u201d Gabbard said in a statement. \u201cThis is a threat to free speech, fair elections, and to our democracy, and I intend to fight back on behalf of all Americans.\u201d The company blamed the Gabbard campaign\u2019s brief suspension after the first Democratic debate on an automated system that flags unusual activity, asserting that they provide ad products \u201cwithout bias toward any party or political ideology.\u201d The Senate intelligence committee has released some of its findings from the panel\u2019s bipartisan investigation into Russian election interference. The first volume of the report includes many blacked-out redactions, but Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the panel, said he hoped the findings would \u201cprovide the American people with valuable insight into the election security threats still facing our nation and the ways we can address them.\u201d \u201cOur bipartisan investigation identified multiple problems and information gaps that hindered our ability to effectively respond and defend against the Russian attack in 2016,\u201d Democratic vice chairman Mark Warner added. \u201cI hope the bipartisan findings and recommendations outlined in this report will underscore to the White House and all of our colleagues, regardless of political party, that this threat remains urgent, and we have a responsibility to defend our democracy against it.\u201d The report\u2019s release comes one day after special counsel Robert Mueller emphasized in his congressional testimony that Russian election interference remains ongoing. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a single attempt. They\u2019re doing it as we sit here,\u201d Mueller said. \u201cAnd they expect to do it during the next campaign.\u201d A staffer for the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA was fired after it was discovered that Trump appeared at the group\u2019s event Tuesday in front of a doctored presidential seal that bore a resemblance to the Russian coat of arms. The fake seal showed a two-headed eagle, similar to the Russian Federation\u2019s state seal, holding a set of golf clubs in its talons. Turning Point USA said there was \u201czero malicious intent\u201d behind the use of the doctored seal, blaming the error on a haphazard Google search. \u201cWe\u2019re sorry for the mix-up and meant no disrespect to the White House or the President or the advance team,\u201d a Turning Point spokesperson said. A source said the now fired individual was told hours before the event that the team needed a presidential seal for the screen behind Trump, and the person \u201cdid the search and with the pressure of the event, didn\u2019t notice that it is a doctored seal.\u201d Representative Ilhan Omar, the Democratic congresswoman who was the subject of a \u201cSend her back\u201d chant at a Trump campaign rally, wrote a New York Times op-ed urging Americans to respond forcefully to the president\u2019s racist comments. Omar writes: The president\u2019s rally will be a defining moment in American history. It reminds us of the grave stakes of the coming presidential election: that this fight is not merely about policy ideas; it is a fight for the soul of our nation. The ideals at the heart of our founding \u2014 equal protection under the law, pluralism, religious liberty \u2014 are under attack, and it is up to all of us to defend them. ... The only way to push back is to be unequivocal about our values. It is not enough to condemn Mr. Trump\u2019s racism. We must affirmatively confront racist policies \u2014 whether the caging of immigrant children at the border or the banning of Muslim immigrants or the allowing of segregation in public housing. ... Today, democracy is under attack once again. It\u2019s time to respond with the kind of conviction that has made America great before. Representative Mark Meadows, a close ally of Trump\u2019s, said he did not think the president\u2019s tweet endorsing the budget deal would sway any members of the House Republican caucus. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe that we should bankrupt America,\u201d Meadows said, voicing conservatives\u2019 concerns about the bill raising federal spending by more than $300 billion. \u201cWe have a difference of opinion on this particular issue and one that\u2019s not going to change.\u201d Most House Republicans are expected to vote \u201cno\u201d on the proposal, which is expected to come up for a vote later today. But the bill could still pass with mostly Democratic support. Jeffrey Epstein has been placed on suicide watch after being found unconscious in his Manhattan jail cell with injuries to the neck. Epstein, who is in jail awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, told officials that he was beaten up and called a child predator, according to CNN. His injuries are reportedly not serious, but the Federal Bureau of Prisons has declined to comment on the matter. The divorce case of Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani has taken another dramatic turn, with the former New York mayor saying the prolonged split forced him to borrow $100,000 from a colleague. Giuliani said after a hearing in New York state court that he borrowed the six-figure sum from fellow Trump lawyer Marc Mukasey after his wife, Judith Giuliani, tied up a joint bank account. \u201cI had to borrow the money to pay taxes, because she was holding up the account,\u201d Giuliani said outside the Manhattan courtroom. \u201cI\u2019ll pay that back to him as soon as this is decided.\u201d Although Giuliani shouted at his wife\u2019s lawyer during a previous hearing, it was Judith who was chastised by the judge today for an outburst. When Giuliani\u2019s lawyer accused her of taking items from their New York condo that did not belong to her, Judith pounded the table and yelled, \u201cI did not!\u201d The judge replied, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tolerate any outbursts.\u201d The case is headed toward trial in January. Trump spoke to the president of the Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to congratulate him on his recent election, the White House said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump and President Zelenskyy discussed ways to strengthen the relationship between the United States and Ukraine, including energy and economic cooperation,\u201d a White House spokesperson said. \u201cBoth leaders also expressed that they look forward to the opportunity to meet.\u201d The House oversight committee has voted along party lines to authorize subpoenas for all White House work communications sent via personal email and cellphone. The panel asked the White House earlier this month for all communications sent via nonofficial means in their investigation of whether the Trump administration violated federal record-keeping laws. The request followed reports that some officials, including the president\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, had been communicating using personal email accounts and encrypted apps. After a heated debate between the panel\u2019s Republicans and Democrats on the issue, the committee voted 23-16 to authorize subpoenas. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to say this any differently: We have laws,\u201d Cummings said during the debate. \u201cAnd the laws say we keep official records.\u201d Republican representative Jim Jordan fired back that his Democratic colleagues were trying to \u201cgo after the emails of the first family in an attempt to create an appearance of some type of controversy.\u201d The passed resolution allows Cummings to subpoena records sent using nonofficial means, \u201cincluding text messages, phone-based message applications, or encryption software, that were not forwarded to the official accounts of the employees within 20 days.\u201d Here\u2019s where the day stands so far. The Justice Department announced it would resume capital punishment after a 16-year lapse of the policy. They have scheduled five executions of death-row inmates, with the first execution set for December 9. Nancy Pelosi has told House Democrats that they have to do their \u201cown thing\u201d when it comes to supporting an impeachment inquiry against Trump. It was reported after special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s hearing that the House speaker had pushed back against entreaties to launch impeachment proceedings. Most House Republicans are expected to oppose the budget deal negotiated between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Pelosi. Trump has encouraged his party\u2019s lawmakers to back the agreement, but a majority still seem inclined to vote \u201cno.\u201d That leaves the question of whether the president will actually sign a huge funding bill mostly backed by Democrats. And we\u2019re still watching this House judiciary committee hearing on the Trump administration\u2019s migrant family separation policy and the conditions of detention centers. Stay tuned. Trump just finished delivering remarks at a ceremony welcoming the new secretary of defense, Mark Esper. \u201cYou\u2019re going to do a great job. I have absolutely no doubt,\u201d Trump said of Esper. The former Republican staffer and lobbyist secured Senate confirmation earlier this week by a vote of 90-8. He will be the Pentagon\u2019s first permanent chief since Jim Mattis, who resigned over policy differences with Trump and left the Defense Department in January. Brian Hastings, Custom and Border Protection\u2019s chief of law enforcement operations, contradicted a report that a 3-year-old migrant girl was forced to choose which of her parents would remain with her in the United States while the other was sent back to Mexico. NPR reported earlier this month that a Honduran girl named Sofia was faced with the heart-wrenching choice at a Border Patrol holding facility in El Paso, Texas. \u201cThe agent asked her who she wanted to go with, mom or dad,\u201d Sofia\u2019s mother, Tania, said through an interpreter. \u201cAnd the girl, because she is more attached to me, she said mom. But when they started to take [my husband] away, the girl started to cry. The officer said, \u2018You said [you want to go] with mom.\u2019 \u201d But Hastings claimed during a House judiciary committee hearing that the child was not choosing which parent would be deported and which would remain in the United States. He said the whole family was sent back to Mexico but was briefly held in separate cells while they were processed at a detention center. According to Hastings, Sofia was only being asked which parent\u2019s cell she wanted to wait in. Only a fraction of the House Republican caucus is expected to support the budget deal negotiated by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House speaker Nancy Pelosi. Even though Trump has urged Republican lawmakers to back the two-year deal that would raise the debt ceiling and end harsh annual spending cuts, the party\u2019s House leadership expects most of its caucus to vote \u201cno\u201d on the deal. House minority whip Steve Scalise said Trump\u2019s supportive tweet \u201chelps\u201d build support within the caucus. But he added, \u201cWe\u2019ve heard from a lot of members who said they\u2019re voting \u2018No,\u2019 no matter what.\u201d The president has already said he backs the deal, but the idea of signing a massive funding bill mostly passed with Democratic support may make him reconsider. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has come out strongly against the Justice Department\u2019s announcement that it would resume capital punishment after a 16-year lapse of the policy. The California senator has a unique history on the issue. She has consistently opposed capital punishment, a position that has landed her in hot water more than once. Most notably, while Harris was serving as San Francisco\u2019s district attorney, she refused to seek the death penalty against the man eventually convicted of killing police officer Isaac Espinoza. The decision was lambasted by the law enforcement community and even some of Harris\u2019 fellow Democrats, such as senator Dianne Feinstein. A migrant child said she was \u201cbeaten and abused\u201d while detained at a facility in Clint, Texas. The alleged abuse occurred on March 12 and is still under investigation by the Customs and Border Protection\u2019s internal watchdog, NBC News reports. The allegation follows other accusations of abuse against migrant children, including an alleged sexual assault against a girl at a facility in Yuma, Arizona. House Democrats are expected to ask about the alleged abuse during a judiciary committee hearing on the Trump administration\u2019s migrant family separation policy and the conditions of detention centers. The hearing is already underway and can be watched live here. The US federal government has not executed a death-row inmate since 2003, when Louis Jones Jr. was put to death for the rape and murder of Pvt. Tracie Joy McBride. McBride was kidnapped from an Air Force base in Texas in 1995 and later beaten to death with a tire iron, a murder that Jones confessed to. Jones died by injection eight years later at the federal penitentiary near Terre Haute, Indiana, the same penitentiary where the Justice Department intends to carry out five more executions between December and January. The five executions scheduled by the Justice Department are set to take place between December 9 and January 15. The department noted the executions will take place at US Penitentiary Terre Haute, Indiana, adding that additional executions \u201cwill be scheduled at a later date.\u201d \u201cEach of these inmates has exhausted their appellate and post-conviction remedies, and currently no legal impediments prevent their executions,\u201d the Justice Department said in its statement. Presidential candidate Kirsten Gillibrand today rolled out what she is calling a \u201cclimate change moonshot\u201d to \u201csave our planet.\u201d The Democratic senator from New York said in a blog post that \u201cclimate change is the most serious threat to humanity today, and we need immediate and bold action to address it before it\u2019s too late.\u201d She said she would enact the Green New Deal and mobilize $10 trillion in public and private funding to neutralize America\u2019s share of the pollution heating the planet by 2050. The deadline aligns with other Democrats running for president, and the spending tops what most have proposed. Gillibrand wants to tax fossil fuel production to generate $100 billion annually for climate mitigation projects. She would put a price on carbon, requiring emitters to pay $52 per metric ton. The senator would also halt new fossil fuel leases on public lands and the outer continental shelf and invest $100 billion in preparing rural communities for the climate crisis. Her plan would require support from Congress. The Justice Department\u2019s noted in its statement about resuming capital punishment that the first person set to be executed belonged to a white supremacist group. \u201cDaniel Lewis Lee, a member of a white supremacist group, murdered a family of three, including an eight-year-old girl,\u201d the Justice Department\u2019s statement read. Lee was found guilty on three counts of murder, among other charges, in 1999. The department has set his execution for December 9. Trump has previously downplayed the growing threat of white nationalism and white supremacy. After a white supremacist attack on two mosques in New Zealand left 49 people dead in March, he was asked whether he considered white nationalism to be a rising threat around the world. \u201cI don\u2019t really,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a small group of people that have very, very serious problems.\u201d The Justice Department said in a statement that it would resume capital punishment after a nearly two-decade lapse on the policy. The statement noted that Attorney General William Barr has asked the director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons to schedule the executions of five death-row inmates convicted of murder, with the first planned for December 9. \u201cCongress has expressly authorized the death penalty through legislation adopted by the people\u2019s representatives in both houses of Congress and signed by the President,\u201d Barr said. \u201cThe Justice Department upholds the rule of law\u2014and we owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system.\u201d Nancy Pelosi told a CNN reporter that she has \u201cnever\u201d discouraged fellow House Democrats from supporting an impeachment inquiry against Trump and that they need to follow their own instincts on the matter. But reports started emerging last night that the House speaker had rebuffed efforts to launch impeachment proceedings after special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s testimony. Some House Democrats also have a deadline of the upcoming recess on their minds, according to CNN. They fear that the impeachment issue could lose momentum if it is not raised before the August recess. Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg is raising eyebrows with his hefty bill for private jet travel. The millennial mayor has spent $300,000 on private jets this year, more than any other Democratic presidential hopeful, the AP reports. Buttigieg\u2019s campaign defended the charter flights as a necessary expense, given its headquarters in South Bend, Indiana. \u201cWe are careful with how we spend our money, and we fly commercial as often as possible,\u201d a Buttigieg spokesperson said. \u201cWe only fly noncommercial when the schedule dictates.\u201d But his competitors seem to already be jumping on the potential gaffe. \u201cNo private planes for this campaign,\u201d Beto O\u2019Rourke said in a video posted to his campaign\u2019s YouTube channel on Monday. The pair of candidates may get a chance to spar over the travel issue next week. They are sharing the same stage on the first night of debates in Detroit. Ford, Honda, Volkswagen and BMW of North America have struck a deal with California to produce more fuel-efficient cars in the US. The agreement could undercut the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to relax gas mileage standards for American cars. The Washington Post reports: Mary D. Nichols, California\u2019s top air pollution regulator, said in an interview Wednesday that she sees the agreement as a potential \u2018olive branch\u2019 to the Trump administration and hopes it joins the deal, which she said gives automakers flexibility in meeting emissions goals without the \u2018massive backsliding\u2019 contained in the White House\u2019s current proposal. ... In a joint statement, the four companies said their decision to hash out a deal with California was driven by a need for predictability, as well as a desire to reduce compliance costs, keep vehicles affordable for customers and be good environmental stewards. Trump is up and tweeting about the two-year budget deal that would raise the debt ceiling and end painful annual spending cuts. The president\u2019s unequivocal endorsement should relieve House minority leader Kevin McCarthy and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell. When the deal between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House speaker Nancy Pelosi was announced, Trump said he was \u201cpleased\u201d with the agreement. But the lack of a full-throated endorsement worried some Republicans, particularly given a handful of conservatives\u2019 complaints about the deal. Trump\u2019s endorsement should quiet those concerns before Congress votes on the bill \u2014 assuming the president doesn\u2019t change his mind, which is always possible. Good morning, live blog readers! Washington is still processing everything we heard from special counsel Robert Mueller yesterday during his hearings before two House panels. But one (very important) person seems to have already reached a conclusion: Nancy Pelosi. The House speaker rebuffed judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler\u2019s entreaties to launch impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump during a closed-door meeting yesterday after Mueller\u2019s appearance. Pelosi called Nadler\u2019s idea to begin drafting articles of impeachment premature, standing by her insistence that the \u201cslow, methodical approach\u201d was the way to go. Pelosi is sure to be asked about her position on impeachment during a media availability later today. Here are a few other things the blog is keeping its eye on: Jeffrey Epstein was found unconscious in his Manhattan jail cell with injuries to the neck, the New York Post reports. The wealthy financier was denied bail last week and is awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges in New York. Puerto Rico\u2019s governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 announced he would resign effective 2 August, our colleague Oliver Laughland reports. Rossell\u00f3 has faced nearly two weeks of protests over misogynistic and homophobic comments he made in leaked text messages. US rapper A$AP Rocky has been charged with assault in Sweden. The artist has been in custody for more than three weeks following a fight in Stockholm late last month, and Trump has said he would reach out to Swedish authorities to discuss securing Rocky\u2019s release. The House judiciary committee will hold a hearing at 10 am EDT on migrant family separations and the conditions of migrant detention centers. The blog is covering all of that and more today. Stay tuned.",
