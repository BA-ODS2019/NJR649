Ron Daniels, chief executive of the UK Sepsis Trust, said increasing antibiotic resistance in the population and growing awareness of sepsis were factors in the figures.</p> <p>\u201cA decade or two ago, infections such as urinary tract infections would be controlled by simple antibiotics. Not so today,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cIf the antibiotic doesn\u2019t begin to control the infection, it may become more complicated \u2013 ideal breeding grounds for the onset of sepsis. A simple urinary tract infection could develop into a complex case in which the kidneys are also involved.\u201d</p> <p>NHS Digital data obtained by the Press Association shows that there were 350,344 recorded hospital admissions with a first or second diagnosis of sepsis in 2017/18, up from 169,125 three years earlier.

      "bodyText": "Hospital admissions in England for potentially deadly sepsis have more than doubled in three years. There were rises among all age groups, including the very young, prompting the head of the UK Sepsis Trust to warn parents that they need to be just as vigilant for sepsis as for meningitis. Sepsis is thought to kill 52,000 people a year in the UK. Ron Daniels, chief executive of the UK Sepsis Trust, said increasing antibiotic resistance in the population and growing awareness of sepsis were factors in the figures. \u201cA decade or two ago, infections such as urinary tract infections would be controlled by simple antibiotics. Not so today,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cIf the antibiotic doesn\u2019t begin to control the infection, it may become more complicated \u2013 ideal breeding grounds for the onset of sepsis. A simple urinary tract infection could develop into a complex case in which the kidneys are also involved.\u201d NHS Digital data obtained by the Press Association shows that there were 350,344 recorded hospital admissions with a first or second diagnosis of sepsis in 2017/18, up from 169,125 three years earlier. These included 38,401 admissions among children aged four and under, up from 30,981 in 2015/16. There were 48,647 admissions of children and young people under 24 in 2017/18, up 32% from 36,847 in 2015/16. \u201cWhat this means is that parents need to continue to be aware of meningitis, but to arguably be even more aware of sepsis, as it affects far more children and can be equally deadly,\u201d Daniels said. He said the ageing population also meant that more older people were suffering from sepsis than before. Daniels said \u201cinvasive healthcare\u201d on very young or very elderly people whose immune systems were compromised could increase the risk of infection. Any infection remaining under-treated increased the risk of sepsis developing. The Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM) has said a tool for tracking sepsis in children is not used as often as it should be, and A&amp;E departments are struggling to ensure that children suspected of having the condition are seen quickly enough and then reviewed by a senior doctor. An RCEM review found that while 92% of A&amp;Es had a tool to assess the risk of sepsis in children, it was used on average only 38% of the time. The lead author of the report, Francesca Cleugh, said the tools led to too many children with fever being placed in a high-risk category, \u201cwhich has limited their consistent use across emergency departments, as it leads to over-investigation and overuse of intravenous antibiotics, which contributes to antibiotic resistance\u201d. Parents who suspect sepsis are advised to go to A&amp;E. Symptoms can include looking mottled, bluish or pale, lethargy or difficulty in waking, feeling abnormally cold to the touch, breathing very fast, or having a seizure or a rash that does not fade. Other warning signs in adults and children include high or low temperatures, difficulty breathing, grunting, and showing no interest in usual activities.",

The decision to make the equipment compulsory follows complaints about the way in which rogue enforcement agents have entered properties and illegally seized possessions. In April, the justice select committee published a highly critical report on the industry, recommending the use of body-worn cameras so that a video record was kept of every visit. Aggressive behaviour, unnecessary home visits to drive up fees and threats to confiscate essential household items exempt from seizure were all recorded as common complaints. The justice minister Paul Maynard said: \u201cThe use of intimidation and aggression by some bailiffs is utterly unacceptable, and it is right we do all we can to tackle such behaviour. \u201cWhilst most bailiffs act above board, body-worn cameras will provide greater security for all involved \u2013 not least consumers who are often vulnerable.

The ministry said it wanted to ensure debt was collected in a fair and safe manner while those who failed to do so would be held to account.

Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said most school leaders worked \u201cextremely hard\u201d to support teachers in dealing with the behaviour of pupils and parents. \u201cIndeed, it is often members of leadership teams who bear the brunt of aggressive behaviour or excessive demands from parents. They certainly don\u2019t need a lecture from Ofsted about how to manage relationships with parents when this is something they do on a daily basis,\u201d Barton said. \u201cIt is vital that we support the wellbeing of teachers and leaders, and ensure that we retain the staff we need to give pupils an excellent education. Schools put a great deal of effort into this. However, Ofsted and the government are the source of much of the stress and anxiety on staff through an extremely high-pressure accountability system.\u201d The survey comes as the government is expected to announce a 2.75% pay rise for teachers in England, although nearly three-quarters of the \u00a3480m total rise is likely to come from existing school budgets. There will be a more generous deal for teachers in Wales, as the Cardiff government uses its devolved powers over pay for the first time. Newly-qualified teachers are to receive a 5% increase while the Welsh education minister, Kirsty Williams, has offered a 2.75% increase for the rest, above the 2.4% recommended by the independent Welsh pay review body.",

      "bodyText": "G4S made a gross profit of \u00a314.3m over a six-year contract running an immigration removal centre that faced allegations of abuse against detainees, the government spending watchdog has revealed. Brook House, near Gatwick airport, was the subject of a BBC Panorama expos\u00e9 in September 2017 in which it was alleged that officials mocked, abused and assaulted detainees. In March this year, the Commons home affairs committee asked the National Audit Office to investigate claims that G4S had been inaccurately reporting its activities in order to generate profits of up to 20% of revenues. The NAO found G4s made a gross profit of \u00a314.3m from its Brook House contract between 2012 and 2018, with gross profit rates of between 10% and 20% per year. The watchdog said 84 incidents of physical and verbal abuse identified from the Panorama footage were not classified as a contractual breach and did not lead to any significant penalties. It said G4S\u2019s profits fell when it started to spend more on delivering the contract after the Panorama broadcast. Yvette Cooper, the chair of the home affairs committee, said: \u201cFor G4S to be making up to 20% gross profits on the Brook House contract at the same time as such awful abuse by staff against detainees was taking place is extremely troubling. \u201cGiven that profits reduced when G4S had to increase staffing and training after the Panorama programme, this raises very serious questions about G4S\u2019s running of the centre to make higher profits whilst not having proper staffing, training, and safeguarding systems in place.\u201d She continued: \u201cWe asked the NAO to look into this contract because the Home Office would not give us complete information about it or about the way they were managing it.

      "bodyText": "The UK energy regulator is under fire for failing to prioritise the climate emergency as it draws up plans for Britain\u2019s energy system. Britain\u2019s biggest business group, the CBI, is concerned that Ofgem is relying on an outdated policy mandate to regulate the industry and set price controls. It insists that the regulator\u2019s statutory responsibilities must have climate action at its core or risk undermining the UK\u2019s climate targets by scuppering future investment in renewable energy. Under its existing remit, Ofgem is required to keep the government\u2019s climate policies in mind but its primary obligation is to protect the interests of energy consumers. The mandate has not been changed since 2011 after an update drafted within the Energy Act 2013 failed to materialise. The CBI said Ofgem had already sent \u201cnegative signals\u201d to investors by failing to prioritise the government\u2019s climate agenda when it sets new rules. \u201cWe believe that Ofgem should be supported with new statutory duties to enable prioritisation of decisions that promote clean growth and progress towards net zero, alongside fair competition and value for money to consumers,\u201d a CBI spokesman said. The warning echoes the committee on climate change, the government\u2019s official climate watchdog, which said last week that the UK would fail to cut carbon to net zero by 2050 unless all policymakers aligned with the goal. Chris Stark, the committee\u2019s chief executive, said it was concerned about Ofgem\u2019s mandate. \u201cIt would be very good for the regulator, and indeed for the government, to make it explicit that achieving net zero is within the regulator\u2019s basket of aims,\u201d he said. The regulator is facing fierce criticism from the industry over proposals to change the way it charges companies to use the national grid, which could deal a blow to renewable energy developers. Alan Whitehead, the shadow energy minister, said: \u201cI\u2019ve repeatedly asked the government to implement its own legislation to get this done but, contrary to all reason, they have declined. \u201cRenewable energy is central to the climate change challenge but Ofgem has not had a statutory obligation to promote the clean green power they\u2019ve been asking for.\u201d Aurora Energy, a consultancy, has said Ofgem\u2019s plans threaten to wipe out up to 6GW of new renewable energy investment. The new rules also risk delaying subsidy-free renewable energy projects by five years. \u201cIndustry is concerned about the impact this will have on securing the urgent investment needed in a range of low-carbon technologies,\u201d the CBI said. One industry source said energy companies had consistently raised the concerns with Ofgem directly but the regulator was \u201crefusing to listen\u201d. An Ofgem spokesman said the regulator had \u201cnever been issued a strategy and policy statement\u201d from the energy act. He said the policy paper went to consultation but was not issued, leaving Ofgem to rely on a policy mandate from 2011. The spokesman added that drafting a new mandate was \u201ca matter for government\u201d and declined to comment on whether Ofgem would ask ministers to overhaul its policy. Chris Skidmore, the interim energy minister, has said there \u201cis no obligation\u201d for the government to update Ofgem\u2019s mandate. He responded to a written parliamentary question from Whitehead last month and said Ofgem\u2019s principal legal duty was to consumers but the regulator must also \u201chave regard\u201d for environmental matters.

      "body": "<p>Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 22 July.</p> <h2>Top stories</h2> <p><strong>Peter Dutton has set up a showdown over temporary exclusion orders, which would enable him to prevent Australian foreign fighters from returning home </strong>for up to two years. Labor and Centre Alliance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/22/peter-dutton-sets-up-showdown-over-foreign-fighters-bill-amid-fears-of-overreach\">fear</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/22/peter-dutton-sets-up-showdown-over-foreign-fighters-bill-amid-fears-of-overreach\"> the laws go too far</a>. The parliament\u2019s joint security committee has recommended changes to Dutton\u2019s temporary exclusion bill, including judicial oversight. Labor will hold its shadow cabinet meeting later on Monday to consider its position on Dutton\u2019s foreign fighter bills, as well as the future drought fund bill the government plans on reintroducing to the parliament this week. Labor knocked back the legislation in the last parliament, concerned it would act as a \u201cslush fund\u201d for National party MPs, as well as take money from necessary infrastructure projects. In a speech late last week, Anthony Albanese said his party would back \u201cany number\u201d the government saw fit to attach to drought funding \u2013 as long as it could guarantee the money would not be taken from other funding pools.</p> <p><strong>The furore over Donald Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/21/trump-race-charlottesville-democrats-ilhan-omar-2020\">racist slurs against four Democratic congresswomen</a> has intensified, as the president stepped up his attacks</strong>, and posted far-right material online. Trump claimed in a tweet that he did not believe representatives Ayanna Pressley, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/20/ocasio-cortez-911-style-commission-migrant-family-separations\">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/21/ilhan-omar-minnesota-trump-the-squad-minneapolis\">Ilhan Omar</a> and Rashida Tlaib were<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/21/trump-racist-squad-democrats-omar-ocasio-cortez-tlaib-pressley\"> \u201ccapable of loving our country\u201d.</a> The allegation, made without evidence, was the latest in a series of grave attacks Trump has directed at the four ethnic-minority congresswomen, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/20/the-squad-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-ilhan-omar-democrats-trump\">hail from the left of the Democratic party</a> and have been sharply critical of his presidency. Trump supporters at a rally in North Carolina responded to his criticisms of Omar, who fled war in Somalia, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/17/trump-rally-send-her-back-ilhan-omar\">by chanting \u201csend her back\u201d</a>. Following widespread condemnation, Trump falsely claimed he had tried to halt the chants.</p> <p><strong>Ange McReynolds was 32 when she first asked one of her friends to \u201ccall up to ask for an escort\u201d. </strong>McReynolds, who has severe cerebral palsy, represented Australia at the 2000 Paralympics in the sport of boccia, which is similar to bocce. Still, in her words, she relies on others to do everything for her. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/22/we-are-sexual-beings-why-disability-advocates-want-the-ndis-to-cover-sexual-services\">The same goes for sex.</a> \u201cI would like to see the NDIS fund it, because some of us can\u2019t afford to see a sex worker,\u201d she says. The minister responsible for the national disability insurance scheme, Stuart Robert, last week declared that the idea the scheme might fund sexual services did not meet \u201ccommunity expectations\u201d. Robert was forced to wade into the issue after a woman in her 40s with multiple sclerosis won the right to have sexual therapy funding in her NDIS plan. Soon after the news broke, Robert said the agency would appeal to the federal court, a rare move that increases the likelihood of a precedent-setting decision.</p> <h2>World</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6bad9c9ab5cad76de769faa251f0f24261cbd1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6bad9c9ab5cad76de769faa251f0f24261cbd1a/0_168_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Riot police clash with anti-extradition demonstrators, after a march to call for democratic reforms in Hong Kong.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Riot police clash with anti-extradition demonstrators, after a march to call for democratic reforms in Hong Kong.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edgar Su/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Police and demonstrators have clashed after hundreds of thousands of anti-government protesters took to the streets of Hong Kong on Sunday, </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/21/hong-kong-mass-china-extradition-bill-demonstrations-protestors\">in the city\u2019s largest demonstration in recent weeks.</a></p> <p><strong>American eyes will be trained on Capitol Hill this week with Robert Mueller scheduled to testify on Russian election interference. </strong>His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/18/mueller-report-read-in-full-trump-russia-document-what-does-it-say\">448-page report</a> is said to contain \u201cvery substantial evidence that the president is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanours\u201d \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/21/mueller-report-trump-nadler-impeachment\">the benchmark for impeachment.</a></p> <p><strong>The UK defence minister, </strong>Tobias Ellwood, has rejected the charge that a British-flagged tanker seized by Iran in the Gulf could have been better protected, and said the priority for the UK must be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/21/uk-defence-minister-tobias-ellwood-rebuffs-criticism-over-tanker-seized-in-gulf-iran\">to de-escalate tensions.</a></p> <p><strong>Imran Khan is heading to Washington to meet Donald Trump on his first visit as Pakistan\u2019s prime minister</strong>.

From the Tesla X SUV, to the fully electric SEA truck, to the one-person, three-wheel Toyota iRoad. \u201cAs a driver, the first thing you notice is that there is no gearbox. Electric cars simply don\u2019t have them. You shift from park to drive to reverse by pressing a button. And when driving, most models use a fixed-ratio gear.

The seizure of a British tanker is inextricably linked to US pressure on Tehran.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Eleanor Ainge Roy bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 22 July. Top stories Peter Dutton has set up a showdown over temporary exclusion orders, which would enable him to prevent Australian foreign fighters from returning home for up to two years. Labor and Centre Alliance fear the laws go too far. The parliament\u2019s joint security committee has recommended changes to Dutton\u2019s temporary exclusion bill, including judicial oversight. Labor will hold its shadow cabinet meeting later on Monday to consider its position on Dutton\u2019s foreign fighter bills, as well as the future drought fund bill the government plans on reintroducing to the parliament this week. Labor knocked back the legislation in the last parliament, concerned it would act as a \u201cslush fund\u201d for National party MPs, as well as take money from necessary infrastructure projects. In a speech late last week, Anthony Albanese said his party would back \u201cany number\u201d the government saw fit to attach to drought funding \u2013 as long as it could guarantee the money would not be taken from other funding pools. The furore over Donald Trump\u2019s racist slurs against four Democratic congresswomen has intensified, as the president stepped up his attacks, and posted far-right material online. Trump claimed in a tweet that he did not believe representatives Ayanna Pressley, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib were \u201ccapable of loving our country\u201d. The allegation, made without evidence, was the latest in a series of grave attacks Trump has directed at the four ethnic-minority congresswomen, who hail from the left of the Democratic party and have been sharply critical of his presidency. Trump supporters at a rally in North Carolina responded to his criticisms of Omar, who fled war in Somalia, by chanting \u201csend her back\u201d. Following widespread condemnation, Trump falsely claimed he had tried to halt the chants. Ange McReynolds was 32 when she first asked one of her friends to \u201ccall up to ask for an escort\u201d. McReynolds, who has severe cerebral palsy, represented Australia at the 2000 Paralympics in the sport of boccia, which is similar to bocce. Still, in her words, she relies on others to do everything for her. The same goes for sex. \u201cI would like to see the NDIS fund it, because some of us can\u2019t afford to see a sex worker,\u201d she says. The minister responsible for the national disability insurance scheme, Stuart Robert, last week declared that the idea the scheme might fund sexual services did not meet \u201ccommunity expectations\u201d. Robert was forced to wade into the issue after a woman in her 40s with multiple sclerosis won the right to have sexual therapy funding in her NDIS plan. Soon after the news broke, Robert said the agency would appeal to the federal court, a rare move that increases the likelihood of a precedent-setting decision. World Police and demonstrators have clashed after hundreds of thousands of anti-government protesters took to the streets of Hong Kong on Sunday, in the city\u2019s largest demonstration in recent weeks. American eyes will be trained on Capitol Hill this week with Robert Mueller scheduled to testify on Russian election interference. His 448-page report is said to contain \u201cvery substantial evidence that the president is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanours\u201d \u2013 the benchmark for impeachment. The UK defence minister, Tobias Ellwood, has rejected the charge that a British-flagged tanker seized by Iran in the Gulf could have been better protected, and said the priority for the UK must be to de-escalate tensions. Imran Khan is heading to Washington to meet Donald Trump on his first visit as Pakistan\u2019s prime minister. Khan is burdened by the task of trying to mend relations mired in mutual distrust and restore financial support cut off by the US president, who suspended military aid worth $300m (\u00a3240m), after accusing Pakistan of not doing enough to fight extremism. Boris Johnson\u2019s hoped-for triumphant march into Downing Street this week is set to be dampened by a carefully timed series of resignations by senior ministers, who will retreat to the backbenches with a vow to thwart any moves towards a no-deal Brexit. Opinion and analysis \u201cA few weeks ago in western Sydney, I fanged around the Eastern Creek racetrack looking to kick the wheels of the electric car revolution,\u201d writes Naaman Zhou. \u201cA lot has been written on the viability of the electric car: the price, the availability, the range, the chargers. But this was solely about the driving experience, from the perspective of someone who has only ever driven petrol cars.\u201d Zhou tests six cars \u2013 from pure electric, to hydrogen fuel-cell, to petrol-hybrids. From the Tesla X SUV, to the fully electric SEA truck, to the one-person, three-wheel Toyota iRoad. \u201cAs a driver, the first thing you notice is that there is no gearbox. Electric cars simply don\u2019t have them. You shift from park to drive to reverse by pressing a button. And when driving, most models use a fixed-ratio gear. There is no clutch, no gearstick, no transmission.\u201d Iran is upping the ante in the Gulf but the UK must not take the bait, writes Sanam Vakil, a senior research fellow in the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House. The seizure of a British tanker is inextricably linked to US pressure on Tehran. Negotiation, not sanctions, is the answer. \u201cUnder siege from US sanctions and receiving limited tangible benefits from Europe, Tehran has chosen to up the ante and make the international community feel some of its pain,\u201d writes Vakil. \u201cBut if Iran continues to escalate it could provoke a greater European-US alignment than would be useful for itself \u2026 While Jeremy Hunt has warned Iran of \u201cserious consequences\u201d, it is important for the British response to be calibrated. Above all, the UK should avoid the temptation to align completely with Washington on Iran.\u201d Sport Australia have retained the Women\u2019s Ashes after a drawn Test with England on day four, however England can still draw the series with T20s still to play. Australia\u2019s Ellyse Perry is the main divide between the two sides, described as \u201cworld class with bat and ball and blessed with an absolute patience\u201d by the Guardian\u2019s Geoff Lemon. New Zealand have beaten Australia 52-51 to win Netball World Cup, as the Silver Ferns withstood a late fightback by Australia\u2019s Diamonds to win their first world title for 16 years. The Silver Ferns\u2019 success completed a recent revival after they had failed to medal for the first time at last year\u2019s Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast. Thibaut Pinot has exploded the status quo in the Tour de France, blowing both Geraint Thomas and Julian Alaphilippe off his back wheel in the Pyrenean mist, as Simon Yates took his second-stage win at the summit finish to stage 15 at Foix Prat d\u2019Albis.

Please do not add spoilers for later episodes in the series.</em></p> \n<p>When the season three tagline was revealed, we didn\u2019t think they meant \u2018blessed be the fight\u2019 in a literal sense \u2013 and yet here\u2019s June, taking off her wings just as a woman in a pre-Gilead age might have taken out her earrings before throwing down. We\u2019ve been waiting all season for her to take the fight to Gilead, but instead she finds herself taking her frustrations out on Ofmatthew, who, yes, is extremely punchable, yet whose piousness is probably the result of trauma and brainwashing.</p> \n<p>But at the end of the episode, as June\u2019s circle of handmaids drag her away from Ofmatthew and shield the scuffle from the Eyes, it is herself she\u2019s really furious with. Her cause is righteous, but her approach is dangerously reckless. As Commander Lawrence keeps reminding her, June is no genius tactician. She is a desperate woman, and people are getting hurt. In this episode, June\u2019s single-minded focus on seeing Hannah, just from a distance, has resulted in death, pain, and Hannah moving further out of her reach than ever. This week explored the ways Gilead forces people to compromise themselves. June\u2019s manipulations of the innocent Martha Frances and vulnerable Mrs Lawrence are some of the worst things we\u2019ve seen her do on the show \u2013 and all so she could smudge herself against the wall of Hannah\u2019s school. It\u2019s a small deed to warrant such a large punishment. \u201cWe saved you,\u201d Ofmatthew insists as Frances hangs. Ofmatthew has a very warped understanding of salvation.</p> \n<p>June and Mrs Lawrence\u2019s field trip taught us a little more about Mrs Lawrence, and her relationship with the Commander. She wanted children but he didn\u2019t, and besides, doctors were always adjusting her \u2018dosage\u2019. It seems she struggled with mental illness even before her husband become a mass-murderer by-proxy, and it strikes us that Gilead isn\u2019t the sort of regime that looks sympathetically on medication for mental illness. Poor Mrs Lawrence, cut adrift in the world, \u201ckeen on an adventure\u201d she\u2019s never quite up to.</p> \n<h2><strong>Canada</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a3e75a14ed46b0964a25b83ccc45a88eec601b4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a3e75a14ed46b0964a25b83ccc45a88eec601b4/0_200_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Moira helps Emily get her fighting spirit back.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Moira helps Emily get her fighting spirit back.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophie Giraud/Hulu</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Canada offers up some positivity this week, as Moira and Emily bond (\u201cHow do we not have any gay in common?!\u201d) and Moira helps Emily rediscover her fighting spirit after a demoralising interview with the same Swiss official who questioned June and the Waterfords last week.</p> \n<p>While most of Emily\u2019s violent actions in Gilead were carried out in a state of shock, she is fully in control now as she and Moira \u2018bird dog\u2019 a politician, and their subsequent holding cell feels more like triumph than punishment. The two women reflect on their actions in Gilead \u2013 hands up who else had forgotten that they were both cold-blooded killers? \u2013 and decide, reasonably, that they were justified. Murder is only murder on the outside; in Gilead, it is the only sort of justice they could get.</p> \n<h2><strong>Washington DC</strong></h2> \n<p>As everyone else is suffering and dying, the Waterfords are having a romantic mini-break in DC, taking in art galleries and balls, while Serena is house-hunting around \u2018unrestored\u2019 houses from before the revolution, where glasses of wine have been unfinished for years and a nursery is chillingly unoccupied. \u201cI think they were Baptists,\u201d Olivia Winslow says blithely as they admire the house\u2019s excellent proportions. Serena\u2019s guilt seems to have evaporated entirely under the approving glow of the Winslows. Does she even wonder what happened to the child that slept in that nursery before their parents became enemies of the state?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ff1a990a723cc1ac91d3f6000768e5728b79696\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ff1a990a723cc1ac91d3f6000768e5728b79696/0_151_2880_1728/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jarring ... the Waterfords dance as everyone else is suffering and dying.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jarring ... the Waterfords dance as everyone else suffers.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jasper Savage/Hulu</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The ball was a jarringly out-of-tone moment. Perhaps it was intended as a comment on the hypocrisy of those who impose theocratic rule only to flout it themselves in private, but Jezebels conveyed that more plausibly in season one. Olivia told Serena she was \u2018with friends\u2019 among this group of urbane wives, all trussed up at a ball Jane Austen would have rolled her eyes at. But Washington DC is a city that staples women\u2019s mouths shut, and where even the wives have to wear veils in public. Surely balls would be out of the question?</p> \n<h2><strong>The sound of music</strong></h2> \n<p>A music-light week, with only Every Single Night by Fiona Apple playing us out as June reels after her fight with Ofmatthew. The song includes the lyric: \u2018I just made a meal for both of us to choke on\u2019 \u2013 a fair assessment of the collateral damage June is racking up at this point.</p> \n<h2><strong>Under his eye</strong></h2> \n<p>\u2022 Is this the first time a TV show has had its viewers cheering someone choking a pregnant woman? Just as Moira and Emily mused on how Gilead changed their morals, perhaps it is having an effect on ours too. How else would we find ourselves itching to throttle a brainwashed pregnant woman, or hoping that Fred finds himself coerced into providing sexual favours in return for promotion?</p> \n<p>\u2022 Are the handmaid-assisted hangings a replacement for the stonings that were effectively boycotted in season one? If so, that\u2019s another bleakly minor victory for June.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"42ad171a-5e4c-40ca-bc10-8d3dbf7eaea2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n

      "bodyText": "Spoiler alert: this recap is for people watching The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, series three, on Channel 4 in the UK. Please do not add spoilers for later episodes in the series. When the season three tagline was revealed, we didn\u2019t think they meant \u2018blessed be the fight\u2019 in a literal sense \u2013 and yet here\u2019s June, taking off her wings just as a woman in a pre-Gilead age might have taken out her earrings before throwing down. We\u2019ve been waiting all season for her to take the fight to Gilead, but instead she finds herself taking her frustrations out on Ofmatthew, who, yes, is extremely punchable, yet whose piousness is probably the result of trauma and brainwashing. But at the end of the episode, as June\u2019s circle of handmaids drag her away from Ofmatthew and shield the scuffle from the Eyes, it is herself she\u2019s really furious with. Her cause is righteous, but her approach is dangerously reckless. As Commander Lawrence keeps reminding her, June is no genius tactician. She is a desperate woman, and people are getting hurt. In this episode, June\u2019s single-minded focus on seeing Hannah, just from a distance, has resulted in death, pain, and Hannah moving further out of her reach than ever. This week explored the ways Gilead forces people to compromise themselves. June\u2019s manipulations of the innocent Martha Frances and vulnerable Mrs Lawrence are some of the worst things we\u2019ve seen her do on the show \u2013 and all so she could smudge herself against the wall of Hannah\u2019s school. It\u2019s a small deed to warrant such a large punishment. \u201cWe saved you,\u201d Ofmatthew insists as Frances hangs. Ofmatthew has a very warped understanding of salvation. June and Mrs Lawrence\u2019s field trip taught us a little more about Mrs Lawrence, and her relationship with the Commander. She wanted children but he didn\u2019t, and besides, doctors were always adjusting her \u2018dosage\u2019. It seems she struggled with mental illness even before her husband become a mass-murderer by-proxy, and it strikes us that Gilead isn\u2019t the sort of regime that looks sympathetically on medication for mental illness. Poor Mrs Lawrence, cut adrift in the world, \u201ckeen on an adventure\u201d she\u2019s never quite up to. Canada Canada offers up some positivity this week, as Moira and Emily bond (\u201cHow do we not have any gay in common?!\u201d) and Moira helps Emily rediscover her fighting spirit after a demoralising interview with the same Swiss official who questioned June and the Waterfords last week. While most of Emily\u2019s violent actions in Gilead were carried out in a state of shock, she is fully in control now as she and Moira \u2018bird dog\u2019 a politician, and their subsequent holding cell feels more like triumph than punishment. The two women reflect on their actions in Gilead \u2013 hands up who else had forgotten that they were both cold-blooded killers? \u2013 and decide, reasonably, that they were justified. Murder is only murder on the outside; in Gilead, it is the only sort of justice they could get. Washington DC As everyone else is suffering and dying, the Waterfords are having a romantic mini-break in DC, taking in art galleries and balls, while Serena is house-hunting around \u2018unrestored\u2019 houses from before the revolution, where glasses of wine have been unfinished for years and a nursery is chillingly unoccupied. \u201cI think they were Baptists,\u201d Olivia Winslow says blithely as they admire the house\u2019s excellent proportions. Serena\u2019s guilt seems to have evaporated entirely under the approving glow of the Winslows. Does she even wonder what happened to the child that slept in that nursery before their parents became enemies of the state? The ball was a jarringly out-of-tone moment. Perhaps it was intended as a comment on the hypocrisy of those who impose theocratic rule only to flout it themselves in private, but Jezebels conveyed that more plausibly in season one. Olivia told Serena she was \u2018with friends\u2019 among this group of urbane wives, all trussed up at a ball Jane Austen would have rolled her eyes at. But Washington DC is a city that staples women\u2019s mouths shut, and where even the wives have to wear veils in public. Surely balls would be out of the question? The sound of music A music-light week, with only Every Single Night by Fiona Apple playing us out as June reels after her fight with Ofmatthew. The song includes the lyric: \u2018I just made a meal for both of us to choke on\u2019 \u2013 a fair assessment of the collateral damage June is racking up at this point. Under his eye \u2022 Is this the first time a TV show has had its viewers cheering someone choking a pregnant woman? Just as Moira and Emily mused on how Gilead changed their morals, perhaps it is having an effect on ours too. How else would we find ourselves itching to throttle a brainwashed pregnant woman, or hoping that Fred finds himself coerced into providing sexual favours in return for promotion? \u2022 Are the handmaid-assisted hangings a replacement for the stonings that were effectively boycotted in season one? If so, that\u2019s another bleakly minor victory for June.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s only episode two and already they are putting the \u201cdark\u201d into Poldark. Political intrigue and the murky hand of \u201cthe crown\u201d lent a Game of Thrones feel to this episode. But instead of the bouncing bosoms amply displayed on HBO, BBC budgetary constraints meant that instead we got the filthy soles of Tess Tregidden\u2019s Hobbit-like feet happily resting on Ross\u2019s dining table, much to Prudie\u2019s disgust. Ah well, we have to get our kicks where we can \u2013 especially as Aidan Turner\u2019s agent seems to have beaten the producers into submission regarding the bare chest activity. (Will we even glimpse a clavicle this series? I bet a sack of slaver\u2019s gold the answer is no.)</p> \n<p>This week was dominated by Creepy Spy Man, AKA the least discreet espionage presence since Grey Squirrel appeared behind a park bench on Dom Joly\u2019s Trigger Happy TV. And yet despite the fact that Creepy Spy Man was constantly following everyone at one pace behind virtually wearing a sign saying \u201cHello, I am following you\u201d, he was noticed only by Demelza. This series is going to be almost exclusively about conspiracy theories and vested interests. And with Ross dragged further into Irish Ned\u2019s case and Dr Enys dragged into defending the insane assassin, a pattern is indeed emerging: Ross is about to be stitched up like Irish Ned. Now Ross must spy on his best friend on behalf of the crown to win the favour of the crown towards his best friend. (Or something like that.)</p> \n<p>Things are not looking good for Evil George, even though he has now become Sir Evil George. From the viewer\u2019s point of view, it\u2019s good news: Elizabeth is back, more beautiful than ever. This is bad news for Sir Evil George, as Elizabeth can never really come back because she was killed off by the terrible tincture. Sir Evil George\u2019s Forsythesque chin strained ever further upwards as Ross sought once more to ask for money for Geoffrey Charles. \u201cBetween your inability to let her go and my \u2026 unfounded suspicions,\u201d he stammered. A wonderful micropause there, indicating that Sir Evil George knows that his suspicions are, in fact, amply founded, as the matching non-haircuts of Ross and Valentine prove.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0472ec8ef6409fe664cccaa6f140706881996ba5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0472ec8ef6409fe664cccaa6f140706881996ba5/0_286_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"God bless the fairy child of Drake and Morwenna!\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">God bless the fairy child of Drake and Morwenna!</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Hogan/BBC/Mammoth Screen</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Back in Cornwall, several storms were brewing. God bless the fairy child of Drake and Morwenna! \u201cShe do keep her distance still?\u201d There\u2019s nothing a cliffside ditty about an old couple can\u2019t cure, though. And soon, Drake was getting her to hold hands with him and talking to her by the fireside about hope and babies. \u201cIs it truly beyond recall?\u201d Probably. For it is said in the scriptures: once a woman has lived with the pig\u2019s-tail-buttocked vicar, all is lost.</p> \n<p>Other moments of note? I love it when they show Ross in parliament, shouting his oratory that no one wants to listen to. Meanwhile Cecily and Geoffrey Charles rival Morwenna and Drake for soppiness. They\u2019re so annoying I almost want the pretend-half-blind poet back. I did like Cecily reading Mary Wollstonecraft, though. God forbid anyone access the ravings of an educated woman. As for Mr Bannantine, he seemed to be hiding from his dialect coach. \u201cUtterrrrly!\u201d And when he was finally discovered, he had to be killed immediately for crimes against accents. Most of all, though, someone riddle me this: what is going on with the Kestrel of Doom? Has he eaten Horace the pug? (Yes, I realise it\u2019s a falcon or whatever. Be gone, ornithological pedants.)</p> \n<h2>Pewter tankard award for bonkers brilliance as supporting actor</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c358bea610aef667ec95b63566055c95aae31910\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c358bea610aef667ec95b63566055c95aae31910/0_286_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Enys always speaks his mind \u2013 even if the medical information he spouts would not remotely have been available in the 19th-century.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Enys always speaks his mind \u2013 even if what he spouts would not remotely be available in the 19th-century.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Hogan/BBC/Mammoth Screen</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Take the stand, Dr Enys (Luke Norris). This was most entertaining in its anachronistic wokeness. \u201cThe true character of insanity is not wild frenzy or raving madness but delusion.\u201d Dr Enys always speaks his mind and protects the underdog, even if the medical information he spouts would not remotely have been available in the early 19th-century. But thank goodness he is investigating the causes and treatments of insanity when so many people around seem to be afflicted. Dr Enys has always been useful in advancing both plot and characterisation and here he is playing a double role, examining the king\u2019s would-be assassin and giving us an insight into Sir Evil George\u2019s hallucinations. Plus, we know from previous series that he has had his own brushes with a) PTSD and b) grief after the loss of a child. It\u2019s a double whammy. Dr Enys is anxiety case study and mental health ally rolled into one. I enjoy his sincerity and his lovely face. We need a lot more Sindy Doll, though. </p> \n<h2>Classic Poldark lines</h2> \n<p>\u2022 \u201cSlave labour. Would that be a concern?\u201d \u201cWhy would it?\u201d He barely blinked. Vintage Sir Evil George.</p> \n<p>\u2022 \u201cYour mamma? I expect she was adorable.\u201d \u201cWould you like to see a picture?\u201d It\u2019s the Tinder date from hell.</p> \n<p>\u2022 \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me they\u2019ve formed an attachment.\u201d \u201cIt will not end well, I fear.\u201d Understatement of the century.</p> \n<p>\u2022 \u201cAnd then I bethought me, \u2018What is a marriage if we stand not together?\u2019\u201d \u2019T\u2019ain\u2019t right and t\u2019ain\u2019t proper to make up random olden day talk.

A cup of tea would be far less distracting.\u201d Translation: \u201cDo not punch the bad slave man in the face.\u201d \u201cCome and have a nice cuppa instead.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 \u201cRalph Hanson and George Warleggan, what could they possibly have in common?\u201d Er, an interest in being evil and owning slaves, perhaps?</p> \n<h2>Regulation reverse sexism bare chest moment</h2> \n<p>Some random swordplay with Irish Ned will not make up for the absence of topless scything. It was excellent swordplay, though. In desperation, we had to content ourselves with Tess Tregidden channelling the Single White Female wishes of every female in the land, ransacking Demelza\u2019s dressing-up box as she muttered: \u201c\u2019Tis not the only thing of hers do sit better on me \u2026\u201d</p> \n<h2>Next week</h2> \n<p>Another mining accident! We haven\u2019t had a mining accident in a while. Meanwhile, Sir Evil George is rapidly descending into madness \u2013 and he\u2019s got a gun. And just when we thought Morwenna could put her old life behind her, the pig\u2019s-tail-buttocked-vicar\u2019s mother is back to remind her of the horror of the pig\u2019s-tail-buttocked years.</p>

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s only episode two and already they are putting the \u201cdark\u201d into Poldark. Political intrigue and the murky hand of \u201cthe crown\u201d lent a Game of Thrones feel to this episode. But instead of the bouncing bosoms amply displayed on HBO, BBC budgetary constraints meant that instead we got the filthy soles of Tess Tregidden\u2019s Hobbit-like feet happily resting on Ross\u2019s dining table, much to Prudie\u2019s disgust. Ah well, we have to get our kicks where we can \u2013 especially as Aidan Turner\u2019s agent seems to have beaten the producers into submission regarding the bare chest activity. (Will we even glimpse a clavicle this series? I bet a sack of slaver\u2019s gold the answer is no.) This week was dominated by Creepy Spy Man, AKA the least discreet espionage presence since Grey Squirrel appeared behind a park bench on Dom Joly\u2019s Trigger Happy TV. And yet despite the fact that Creepy Spy Man was constantly following everyone at one pace behind virtually wearing a sign saying \u201cHello, I am following you\u201d, he was noticed only by Demelza. This series is going to be almost exclusively about conspiracy theories and vested interests. And with Ross dragged further into Irish Ned\u2019s case and Dr Enys dragged into defending the insane assassin, a pattern is indeed emerging: Ross is about to be stitched up like Irish Ned. Now Ross must spy on his best friend on behalf of the crown to win the favour of the crown towards his best friend. (Or something like that.) Things are not looking good for Evil George, even though he has now become Sir Evil George. From the viewer\u2019s point of view, it\u2019s good news: Elizabeth is back, more beautiful than ever. This is bad news for Sir Evil George, as Elizabeth can never really come back because she was killed off by the terrible tincture. Sir Evil George\u2019s Forsythesque chin strained ever further upwards as Ross sought once more to ask for money for Geoffrey Charles. \u201cBetween your inability to let her go and my \u2026 unfounded suspicions,\u201d he stammered. A wonderful micropause there, indicating that Sir Evil George knows that his suspicions are, in fact, amply founded, as the matching non-haircuts of Ross and Valentine prove. Back in Cornwall, several storms were brewing. God bless the fairy child of Drake and Morwenna! \u201cShe do keep her distance still?\u201d There\u2019s nothing a cliffside ditty about an old couple can\u2019t cure, though. And soon, Drake was getting her to hold hands with him and talking to her by the fireside about hope and babies. \u201cIs it truly beyond recall?\u201d Probably. For it is said in the scriptures: once a woman has lived with the pig\u2019s-tail-buttocked vicar, all is lost. Other moments of note? I love it when they show Ross in parliament, shouting his oratory that no one wants to listen to. Meanwhile Cecily and Geoffrey Charles rival Morwenna and Drake for soppiness. They\u2019re so annoying I almost want the pretend-half-blind poet back. I did like Cecily reading Mary Wollstonecraft, though. God forbid anyone access the ravings of an educated woman. As for Mr Bannantine, he seemed to be hiding from his dialect coach. \u201cUtterrrrly!\u201d And when he was finally discovered, he had to be killed immediately for crimes against accents. Most of all, though, someone riddle me this: what is going on with the Kestrel of Doom? Has he eaten Horace the pug? (Yes, I realise it\u2019s a falcon or whatever. Be gone, ornithological pedants.) Pewter tankard award for bonkers brilliance as supporting actor Take the stand, Dr Enys (Luke Norris). This was most entertaining in its anachronistic wokeness. \u201cThe true character of insanity is not wild frenzy or raving madness but delusion.\u201d Dr Enys always speaks his mind and protects the underdog, even if the medical information he spouts would not remotely have been available in the early 19th-century. But thank goodness he is investigating the causes and treatments of insanity when so many people around seem to be afflicted. Dr Enys has always been useful in advancing both plot and characterisation and here he is playing a double role, examining the king\u2019s would-be assassin and giving us an insight into Sir Evil George\u2019s hallucinations. Plus, we know from previous series that he has had his own brushes with a) PTSD and b) grief after the loss of a child. It\u2019s a double whammy. Dr Enys is anxiety case study and mental health ally rolled into one. I enjoy his sincerity and his lovely face. We need a lot more Sindy Doll, though. Classic Poldark lines \u2022 \u201cSlave labour. Would that be a concern?\u201d \u201cWhy would it?\u201d He barely blinked. Vintage Sir Evil George. \u2022 \u201cYour mamma? I expect she was adorable.\u201d \u201cWould you like to see a picture?\u201d It\u2019s the Tinder date from hell. \u2022 \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me they\u2019ve formed an attachment.\u201d \u201cIt will not end well, I fear.\u201d Understatement of the century. \u2022 \u201cAnd then I bethought me, \u2018What is a marriage if we stand not together?\u2019\u201d \u2019T\u2019ain\u2019t right and t\u2019ain\u2019t proper to make up random olden day talk. But \u2019tis Poldark so we be not a-worryin\u2019 about it. \u2022 \u201cLet us not treat our fellow diners to displays of martial arts.\u201d \u201cNo indeed! A cup of tea would be far less distracting.\u201d Translation: \u201cDo not punch the bad slave man in the face.\u201d \u201cCome and have a nice cuppa instead.\u201d \u2022 \u201cRalph Hanson and George Warleggan, what could they possibly have in common?\u201d Er, an interest in being evil and owning slaves, perhaps? Regulation reverse sexism bare chest moment Some random swordplay with Irish Ned will not make up for the absence of topless scything. It was excellent swordplay, though. In desperation, we had to content ourselves with Tess Tregidden channelling the Single White Female wishes of every female in the land, ransacking Demelza\u2019s dressing-up box as she muttered: \u201c\u2019Tis not the only thing of hers do sit better on me \u2026\u201d Next week Another mining accident! We haven\u2019t had a mining accident in a while. Meanwhile, Sir Evil George is rapidly descending into madness \u2013 and he\u2019s got a gun. And just when we thought Morwenna could put her old life behind her, the pig\u2019s-tail-buttocked-vicar\u2019s mother is back to remind her of the horror of the pig\u2019s-tail-buttocked years.",

      "body": "<p>Jeremy Corbyn has said Labour needs to \u201ceducate\u201d itself on antisemitism as his party launched an <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/no-place-for-antisemitism/\">educational webpage</a> that hopes to help drive the issue out of the party.</p> <p>Labour has provided members with \u201cbasic tools\u201d to call out antisemitic stereotypes and conspiracy theories in an attempt to defeat the problem. The materials, on the party\u2019s website, include guidance on how to avoid antisemitism when criticising Israel, and explanations of terms such as Zionism.</p> <p>In an email to members, Corbyn said the Labour movement needed to \u201ceducate ourselves and each other to better stand in solidarity with and unite all those facing oppression and discrimination. That\u2019s why we are launching education materials for our members and supporters to help them confront bigotry, wherever it arises.</p> <p>\u201cOver the coming months, the party will produce educational materials on a number of specific forms of racism and bigotry. Our first materials are on antisemitism, recognising that anti-Jewish bigotry has reared its head in our movement. Hatred towards Jewish people is rising in many parts of the world. Our party is not immune from that poison \u2013 and we must drive it out from our movement.\u201d</p> <p>He said the party must face up to the unsettling truth that \u201ca small number of Labour members hold antisemitic views and a larger number don\u2019t recognise antisemitic stereotypes and conspiracy theories\u201d.</p> <p>Corbyn said: \u201cThe evidence is clear enough. The worst cases of antisemitism in our party have included Holocaust denial, crude Jewish-banker stereotypes, conspiracy theories blaming Israel for 9/11 or every war on the Rothschild family, and even one member who appeared to believe that Hitler had been misunderstood.</p> <p>\u201cSo please engage with the materials we are producing, which will be placed on a page on our website, along with other resources, so our movement can be the strongest anti-racist force in our country.\u201d</p> <p>It comes before a challenging week for the leadership in which the shadow cabinet will meet to discuss antisemitism before Corbyn faces MPs at the parliamentary Labour party.</p> <p>The release of the webpage comes after Labour\u2019s main Jewish group, the Jewish Labour Movement, wrote to every member of the shadow cabinet urging them to show \u201creal resolve\u201d to end what it claims is institutional racism against Jews in the party.</p> <p>On Sunday, the first Westminster MP of Palestinian descent said the row over antisemitism was stifling discussion of Palestine. Layla Moran, a Lib Dem MP whose mother is Palestinian, said those in UK politics with antisemitic views should \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/21/talk-palestine-antisemitism-labour-mps-palestinian-statehood\">clear off from the Palestinian quest for freedom and justice</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Moran, the MP for Oxford West and Abingdon since 2017, said it was hard to write or talk about antisemitism and the Labour party\u2019s handling of it without descending into deep despair.</p> <p>She wrote: \u201cThis is having greater consequences than the Labour leadership can imagine. In particular, it is stifling the ability of commentators and decision-makers to talk sensibly about the real issues in Palestine.\u201d</p> <p>Describing herself as \u201ca British-Palestinian who believes in Israel\u2019s right to exist\u201d, Moran said she believed the controversy was making it harder to talk about Palestine and the peace process at a time when efforts for a genuine solution were being hampered by Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cone-sided\u201d plans. </p> <p>\u201cSo, to all the vile antisemites out there: clear off from the Palestinian quest for freedom and justice,\u201d she said. \u201cTake your odious Jew-hatred elsewhere and do not think for one second that your views help champion Palestinian rights.\u201d</p> <p>The webpage launch followed accusations by the Board of Deputies of British Jews that the party was \u201cletting off\u201d people accused of antisemitism, after a leaked draft of its disciplinary process showed that some members could avoid punishment in serious cases where they had apologised and agreed to undergo education.</p> <p>John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, told BBC Radio 5\u2019s Pienaar\u2019s Politics that he would accept the findings of an inquiry into antisemitism in Labour by the Equality and Human Rights Commission.</p> <p>He said: \u201cI want it quicker actually, I need it speeded up. Let\u2019s learn the lessons and then also work with the organisation to implement what recommendations they bring forward. On that basis I\u2019m hoping we\u2019ll get a clean bill of health but more importantly we can become much more effective at tackling not just antisemitism but racism, both in our party and society overall.\u201d</p> <p>He reiterated the message from the Labour leadership that the claim of some antisemites to represent Corbyn was not correct. He said: \u201cThe vast bulk of them are not Labour party members; some of them portray themselves as supporters of Jeremy Corbyn or myself. Let me make this absolutely clear to these vile creatures you do not do that in our name.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has said Labour needs to \u201ceducate\u201d itself on antisemitism as his party launched an educational webpage that hopes to help drive the issue out of the party. Labour has provided members with \u201cbasic tools\u201d to call out antisemitic stereotypes and conspiracy theories in an attempt to defeat the problem. The materials, on the party\u2019s website, include guidance on how to avoid antisemitism when criticising Israel, and explanations of terms such as Zionism. In an email to members, Corbyn said the Labour movement needed to \u201ceducate ourselves and each other to better stand in solidarity with and unite all those facing oppression and discrimination. That\u2019s why we are launching education materials for our members and supporters to help them confront bigotry, wherever it arises. \u201cOver the coming months, the party will produce educational materials on a number of specific forms of racism and bigotry. Our first materials are on antisemitism, recognising that anti-Jewish bigotry has reared its head in our movement. Hatred towards Jewish people is rising in many parts of the world. Our party is not immune from that poison \u2013 and we must drive it out from our movement.\u201d He said the party must face up to the unsettling truth that \u201ca small number of Labour members hold antisemitic views and a larger number don\u2019t recognise antisemitic stereotypes and conspiracy theories\u201d. Corbyn said: \u201cThe evidence is clear enough. The worst cases of antisemitism in our party have included Holocaust denial, crude Jewish-banker stereotypes, conspiracy theories blaming Israel for 9/11 or every war on the Rothschild family, and even one member who appeared to believe that Hitler had been misunderstood. \u201cSo please engage with the materials we are producing, which will be placed on a page on our website, along with other resources, so our movement can be the strongest anti-racist force in our country.\u201d It comes before a challenging week for the leadership in which the shadow cabinet will meet to discuss antisemitism before Corbyn faces MPs at the parliamentary Labour party. The release of the webpage comes after Labour\u2019s main Jewish group, the Jewish Labour Movement, wrote to every member of the shadow cabinet urging them to show \u201creal resolve\u201d to end what it claims is institutional racism against Jews in the party. On Sunday, the first Westminster MP of Palestinian descent said the row over antisemitism was stifling discussion of Palestine. Layla Moran, a Lib Dem MP whose mother is Palestinian, said those in UK politics with antisemitic views should \u201cclear off from the Palestinian quest for freedom and justice\u201d. Moran, the MP for Oxford West and Abingdon since 2017, said it was hard to write or talk about antisemitism and the Labour party\u2019s handling of it without descending into deep despair. She wrote: \u201cThis is having greater consequences than the Labour leadership can imagine. In particular, it is stifling the ability of commentators and decision-makers to talk sensibly about the real issues in Palestine.\u201d Describing herself as \u201ca British-Palestinian who believes in Israel\u2019s right to exist\u201d, Moran said she believed the controversy was making it harder to talk about Palestine and the peace process at a time when efforts for a genuine solution were being hampered by Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cone-sided\u201d plans. \u201cSo, to all the vile antisemites out there: clear off from the Palestinian quest for freedom and justice,\u201d she said. \u201cTake your odious Jew-hatred elsewhere and do not think for one second that your views help champion Palestinian rights.\u201d The webpage launch followed accusations by the Board of Deputies of British Jews that the party was \u201cletting off\u201d people accused of antisemitism, after a leaked draft of its disciplinary process showed that some members could avoid punishment in serious cases where they had apologised and agreed to undergo education. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, told BBC Radio 5\u2019s Pienaar\u2019s Politics that he would accept the findings of an inquiry into antisemitism in Labour by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. He said: \u201cI want it quicker actually, I need it speeded up. Let\u2019s learn the lessons and then also work with the organisation to implement what recommendations they bring forward. On that basis I\u2019m hoping we\u2019ll get a clean bill of health but more importantly we can become much more effective at tackling not just antisemitism but racism, both in our party and society overall.\u201d He reiterated the message from the Labour leadership that the claim of some antisemites to represent Corbyn was not correct. He said: \u201cThe vast bulk of them are not Labour party members; some of them portray themselves as supporters of Jeremy Corbyn or myself. Let me make this absolutely clear to these vile creatures you do not do that in our name.\u201d",

For example, scientists now say the unprecedented heat and wildfires across the northern hemisphere in 2018 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/northern-hemispheres-extreme-heatwave-in-2018-impossible-without-climate-change\">could not have occurred without human-induced climate change</a>\u201d. In Australia, the scorching summer of 2016-17 in New South Wales was <a href=\"https://www.climatecouncil.org.au/resources/angry-summer-report/\">made at least 50 times more likely by global heating</a>, linking it directly to climate change.</p>\n    <p>Hotter air can also carry more water vapour, meaning more intense rain and more flooding.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Another important factor in the northern hemisphere is the impact of changes in the Arctic. The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/27/climate-change-human-fingerprint-found-on-global-extreme-weather\">strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves</a> (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America.</p>\n    <p>When these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Most of the planet\u2019s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons. <a href=\"https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/another-unprecedented-tropical-cyclone-and-flooding-hits-mozambique\">Record-breaking cyclones hit Mozambique</a> in March and April. The deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/13/global-warming-made-hurricane-harvey-deadly-rains-three-times-more-likely-research-shows\">three times more likely by climate change</a>. Rising sea level also means storms cause more coastal damage.</p>\n    <p>Global heating does not influence all extreme weather \u2013 natural variability still exists. <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/mapped-how-climate-change-affects-extreme-weather-around-the-world\">Carbon Brief analysed more than 230 studies</a> and found 95% of heatwaves were made more likely or worse by climate change. For droughts, 65% were definitely affected by our hotter world, while the figure for floods was 57%. It is now undeniable that global heating is causing more extreme weather.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Andy Page, the chief Met Office meteorologist, said: \u201cAs we head into next week, temperatures will increase daily across much of England and Wales as hot air is drawn up from France and Spain.

      "bodyText": "Brooks Koepka was left frustrated by the slow play of his partner JB Holmes as he failed to rustle up his customary last-round finish. The world No 1 had won four of the last nine majors coming into Portrush but a spluttering final-round 74 \u2013 including four bogeys in the first four holes \u2013 left him tied for fourth overall with Lee Westwood on six under. And towards the end of the round, with the chances of winning his first Open title long gone, the American signalled his displeasure at Holmes\u2019s play by tapping his wrist in the direction of his officials. \u201cThere are a lot of slow guys out here, that\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve done it, especially when you\u2019ve got a walking official with you,\u201d Koepka said. \u201cI\u2019m ready to go most of the time. That\u2019s what I don\u2019t understand when it\u2019s your turn to hit, your glove is not on, then you start thinking about it, that\u2019s where the problem lies. \u201cIt\u2019s not that he takes that long. He doesn\u2019t do anything until his turn. That\u2019s the frustrating part.

He\u2019ll also want to avoid the stigma of shipping a big lead on the 20th anniversary of Jean van de Velde\u2019s infamous collapse at Carnoustie, <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/2019/7/17/20697305/golf-meltdown-jean-van-de-velde-1999-british-open\">the Frenchman having tossed away a five-shot, third-round advantage in 1999</a>. And then there\u2019s the incoming wind and rain, which could wreak unpredictable havoc.</p> <p><strong>Koepka, in hot pursuit, nearly tossed away a seven-stroke lead of his own at the PGA a couple of months ago, and was more than happy to spell out the dangers that lie ahead for Lowry.</strong> \u201cThe last time Shane had the lead at Oakmont we saw what happened. In links golf, all of a sudden you get a couple of bad bounces or get in a couple of bunkers. At Bethpage it went very quickly. Bad weather happened. The last 15 holes were very, very windy, especially that back nine.\u201d</p> <p><strong>If a steely-eyed operator like Koepka can feel the heat, anyone can, so nothing\u2019s certain.</strong> But hey. If Lowry keeps his cool like he did yesterday afternoon amid an emotional storm, and draws on his experience playing in a real one - let\u2019s be fair, he\u2019ll have played a fair few rounds in Irish wind and rain before - he\u2019ll take some catching. One way or another, it promises to be one of the most memorable days in the entire history of Irish golf. God speed, everyone, and may the best man drink liberally from the auld jug tonight.

      "bodyText": "And so the 148th Open Championship comes to a close. Golf\u2019s oldest and grandest tournament came back to Northern Ireland after a 68-year hiatus, and the Claret Jug will be staying on the island. All that\u2019s left to do is congratulate the magnificent Shane Lowry, offer commiserations to runner-up Tommy Fleetwood, point you in the direction of Ewan Murray\u2019s verdict, and post, for one last time, the leaderboard. Thanks so much for reading. -15: Lowry -9: Fleetwood -7: Finau -6: Westwood, Koepka -5: MacIntyre, Hatton, Willett, Fowler -4: Reed -3: Molinari, Lewis, Thomas, Noren, Rahm -2: Fox, Bjerregaard, Sabbatini, Park -1: Oosthuizen, Cink, Redman, Glover, Van Rooyen, Fitzpatrick, Smith, Stenson, Spieth, Rose E: Kisner, Simpson \u201cI can\u2019t wait to wake up tomorrow morning, and find out what it\u2019s going to feel like then. It\u2019s just going to be incredible!\u201d What a lovely quote that is. All the innocent, childlike joy of winning one of sport\u2019s most famous prizes, laid out bare. Lowry becomes the sixth Irish major champion, after Fred Daly (1947 Open), Padraig Harrington (2007 and 2008 Open, 2008 PGA), Graeme McDowell (2010 US Open), Rory McIlroy (2011 US Open, 2012 and 2014 PGA, 2014 Open) and Darren Clarke (2011 Open). Golf\u2019s an all-Ireland sport, so play nicely. And now Lowry, cradling the jug in his arms, talks to Sky. \u201cThis feels like an out-of-body experience. I was so calm coming down the last! I couldn\u2019t believe it. What a day. It was difficult out there, the weather was so hard. I wasn\u2019t going great during the middle of the round, but then I took a look at the leaderboard and saw everyone else was struggling, and then it became a two-horse race between me and Tommy. And that was good for me, I think, because I could focus on Tommy as far as I could. I told my caddie that I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about winning, but he said: stay with me, stay with me. And kept on my back. What a job he did. I can\u2019t wait to wake up tomorrow morning, and find out what it\u2019s going to feel like then. It\u2019s just going to be incredible!\u201d \u201cWith a score of 269, the winner of the gold medal, and the Champion Golfer of the Year, is Shane Lowry!\u201d The big man is introduced to the crowd, and he waves to the stands before taking receipt of the Claret Jug and hoisting it into the air. Then his speech. \u201cI love this place. It\u2019s one of my favourite places in Ireland. To be able to come up here and play in an Open Championship is great!\u201d Then he pauses and takes a breath before he thanks his mum and dad. \u201cThey sacrificed so much for me when I was younger, and I\u2019m so happy I can hand them this trophy tonight!\u201d His voice cracks, he wipes away a tear. He thanks his wife and daughter, it\u2019s so special that they\u2019re there. And lastly the fans. \u201cThank you so much! This one\u2019s for you!\u201d Not a dry eye in the house! Lowry\u2019s in the scorer\u2019s hut right now, bouncing off the walls. He doesn\u2019t know what to do with himself right now. \u201cThat was so stressful!\u201d he laughs. Not sure whether he was talking about that final round, checking his scorecard, or making his way through the crowds, because everyone wanted a piece of their hero. Anyway, everything\u2019s been checked and double-checked, and the presentation ceremony will take place in short order! There had been plenty of talk about an Irish champion being crowned here at Portrush this week. Most of it about Rory McIlroy. That wasn\u2019t to be. But few thought Shane Lowry - who missed the cut at the last four Opens - would take the prize here. Try to tell that story on Thursday morning, and most folk would have filed it alongside the tale of Finn MacCool building the Giant\u2019s Causeway with his bare hands. Here we are, though! And good lord, but it\u2019s been thoroughly deserved. That blistering outward run of 31 on Friday. Yesterday\u2019s course-record 63. And all the big shots, careful chips and ice-cool putts today, whenever they were required to steady the ship as he battled to land his maiden major. An Irish winner in Ireland is one of the great Open stories ... but let the record also state that this was one of the great Open performances as well. Sensational Shane! He very nearly drains a fairytale birdie putt. Not quite, but who cares?! He taps in for par. A final round of 72, and he\u2019s won the Open by six shots! The biggest margin of victory at the Open since Louis Oosthuizen triumphed by seven at St Andrews in 2010. He throws his arms into the air, embraces his caddie, then his wife Wendy, then his daughter Iris, then Tommy Fleetwood. An Irish champion in Ireland! The fairytale is written! Tommy Fleetwood lags his long birdie putt to a couple of feet. He cleans up for par, and a 74. He ends the week in second place ... his second runner-up finish in the majors ... and is rewarded with a lovely ovation. Next time, Tommy. But now he gives the stage over to Lowry. Fleetwood sends his second just off the back of the green. It should ensure he finishes second, a result he thoroughly deserves. But this is all about Lowry, who finds the green with his second, at which point Portrush erupts! He opens his arms out as wide as they can go, a celebration of triumph perhaps, though you can imagine he\u2019s trying to hug the atmosphere, throwing his arms around the world. This is one hell of a party already! The ole-ole-oles ring around the 18th, as he grins the widest grin. His partner flashes him a similarly sparkling smile, their daughter in her arms. Their eyes meet. The sweetest moment. He punches the air. He\u2019s about to win the Open! Lowry clips an iron down the fairway at 18. That\u2019s the last big job completed. He looks to the heavens and blows hard. Fleetwood follows him down. Up on the green, it\u2019s par for Koepka, who ends with a 74. He\u2019s tied for fourth, at-6, his worst showing at a major this year. ! But it\u2019s an embarrassing 16-over-par 87 for JB Holmes. A couple of sevens and a couple of sixes on the way back, having gone out in 41. Back in 46! He\u2019s +6, after starting the day just six off Lowry\u2019s lead. My, my, dear me. Two-putt pars again for Lowry and Fleetwood. As Ireland\u2019s hero makes his way to the 18th tee, through a tunnel of ecstatic supporters, he steadfastly refuses to take up any of the many high-five offers. He\u2019s taking nothing for granted. Unlike the R&amp;A engraver, who has already etched his name onto the Claret Jug! But fair\u2019s fair, Lowry has a six-shot lead. Jean van de Velde would have closed it out at Carnoustie in 1999 with a six-shot lead. -15: Lowry (17) -9: Fleetwood (17) Up on 18, Justin Rose signs for a thoroughly awful final round of 79. One of the pre-tournament favourites just never got going today. It\u2019s a 74 for Rickie Fowler, meanwhile, who did well to keep it together after spraying that opening drive out of bounds. He\u2019s -5, and it\u2019s another high finish at the Open without reward. One day, Rickie, one day. Lowry knows this is done. His face has betrayed his nerves a couple of times today: at the 1st and 2nd, then again during that mid-round run of bogeys. But he\u2019s found his neutral space again. An easy tee shot down 17, then a glorious swish into the heart of the green. Fleetwood\u2019s on in two as well, fine work after a wild drive, but this is all over now. An eerie silence descends on the 17th, almost as though the crowd are saving themselves for the big party at the 18th green. Mind you, it\u2019s all Lowry can do to stop himself from breaking into a premature grin! He\u2019s fighting it. He may as well not bother, though, because it won\u2019t be too long before he\u2019s crowned Champion Golfer! Two-putt pars for Shane Lowry and Tommy Fleetwood on 16. It\u2019s close now. So close. The crowds close in on Lowry as he makes his way to the 17th tee. It\u2019s a struggle for him to make his way through. The celebrations haven\u2019t quite started already, but folk are gearing up for a good time. Meanwhile Danny Willett is the latest player to feel the love of the Portrush crowd, as he finishes with a round of 73 at -5. But Brooks Koepka uncharacteristically yips a short one at 17, and he\u2019s back to -6. Very much a day to forget for the current PGA champion. -15: Lowry (16) -9: Fleetwood (16) -7: Finau (F) It\u2019s been a miserable day for an awful lot of players. Jordan Spieth shot 77, ending back at -1. Henrik Stenson finished with a trio of bogeys; a 76 that puts him down to -1. Also at -1, Cameron Smith, who shot 76 as well. And now Lee Westwood nearly drains a long birdie putt on 18, but it fails to drop, and his aborted fairytale ends with a disappointing 73. He\u2019s given a lovely warm reception, though, and he smiles broadly as he bows theatrically. He ends the week at -6, the sort of high finish few expected at the start of the week. Lowry clears another hurdle, as he carefully threads his tee shot at 16 onto the front of the green. No time for heroics now. Fleetwood needs a miracle now - even an outrageous hole-in-one wouldn\u2019t make the sort of gains he needs - but he can only send his tee shot just off the front left, and there are dramatic undulations between his ball and the hole. A simple two putts for Lowry, you\u2019d think, but a lot of work to do for Fleetwood for his par. Lowry strokes in his birdie putt! That\u2019s put an end to a difficult run of holes, and he must know this Open is his now. He clenches his fist and pumps the air, bending over with the intensity of the moment. All Fleetwood can do is par, and the Portrush gallery, literally dampened during the tempest, spiritually so as Lowry stumbled a little, erupt in excitement. This is on! It\u2019s really on now! -15: Lowry (15) -9: Fleetwood (15) -7: Finau (F), Koepka (16) And you fancy Shane Lowry is going to win one of these today! He clips a gorgeous wedge pin high at 15, and he\u2019ll have a look at birdie from ten feet or so. Fleetwood surely has to match him, but can only send his to 30 feet. He trudges up to the green with a drained expression on his face. It\u2019s not going to happen for him, unless something very strange and dramatic unfolds quite soon. Meanwhile birdie at the 18th for Jon Rahm, who smiles broadly at the end of a difficult 75. He ends his week at -3. Tony Finau nearly rakes in a monster on 18 for birdie. It doesn\u2019t drop, but he\u2019s signing for a level-par 71 to end the week at -7. He\u2019s the only one of the late starters not over par. So this\u2019ll be his second top-five finish in the majors this season, after Augusta, and consecutive top-ten finishes at the Open. You fancy he\u2019ll win one of these one day. Fowler can\u2019t make his birdie putt on 16. Such a shame after a lovely tee shot. Koepka birdies 15, his first of the day, and he joins Finau in third place at -7. And back on 15, Lowry and Fleetwood both find the fairway with their tee shots. -14: Lowry (14) -9: Fleetwood (14) -7: Finau (17), Koepka (15) -6: Westwood (17), Fowler (16) Rickie Fowler hits one of the shots of the week at Calamity, the long par-three 16th. A low fade that curls into the front of the green, ten feet to the right of the flag. Meanwhile back on 14, it\u2019s yet another bogey for Lowry, as he cradles his putt to the hole. No big problem, because Fleetwood has putted up from the bottom of the bank, and left himself a 15-footer for bogey. He really has to make it. He doesn\u2019t make it. It slides by the right of the cup. A double, he cups his face in disbelief, and the lead is five again - but now there\u2019s only four to play! Lowry so close now to realising his dream. -14: Lowry (14) -9: Fleetwood (14) A real poser for Fleetwood, who is chipping blind over the hillock, from an angle that takes the bunker on the other side into play. He tries to flip into the heart of the green, and finds the short stuff, but his ball topples off the right and into the swale. He hangs his head, knowing perhaps that the jig might be up. Especially as Lowry clips up to 15 feet. Not a gimme for par, but he\u2019s in match-play mode now. So long as he matches or betters Fleetwood\u2019s score, he\u2019ll be heel-kicking his way to the next tee. Birdie for Rickie Fowler on 15! Unfortunately it comes after a run of two bogeys and a double in five holes. Still, he\u2019s back to -6, and with the conditions doing a number on all the late starters, that\u2019s a precious shot in the pursuit of a high finish that\u2019ll make him feel a whole lot better once the sting of missing out on yet another major subsides. Lowry whisks a hot one out of the rough. It skitters hysterically through the green, and he\u2019s fairly fortunate that it stops in the first cut at the bottom of the swale. A few more inches, and he\u2019d be chipping up from the thick, tangled tat. Fleetwood meanwhile opts to go for the green from the sand, 134 yards away. It\u2019s short and right, and in some real bother behind a filthy hillock. Fleetwood pearls a 3-wood over 300 yards. Too good. It\u2019s into the bunker down the left of 14. Lowry tugs his tee shot into the thick rough down the same side, though his ball looks to be sitting OK. It\u2019s visible from a distance, anyway, which has to be a good sign. Alex Noren signs for a 74 after coming back in 38; he finishes at -3. Bogey for Lee Westwood at 16; he\u2019s -6. Meanwhile Xander Schauffele had an absolute nightmare today, out in 38, back in 40. His 78 won\u2019t improve his mood at the end of a week in which he feels he\u2019s been hung out to dry by the R&amp;A. He ends up at +2. Fleetwood\u2019s putt is huge in the context of this Open. You\u2019d think if he misses this, it\u2019ll steady Lowry\u2019s ship, which, while not yet rocking, has been gently swaying for the last 30 minutes or so. But in it goes. That turns the pressure back on Lowry, and though he makes his putt, it only just drops, threatening to turn left before the lip grabs the ball and swallows it down. Gulp. A couple of pars. But boy did they have to work for them. -15: Lowry (13) -11: Fleetwood (13) Fleetwood, down the bottom of the swale, opens the face of his wedge and goes full Mickelson. He delicately lobs up onto the green - there\u2019s not much of it to play with in front of the flag - and he leaves it ten feet short. Another must-make putt coming up, because Lowry splashes out from the wet sand to three feet. If this was match-play, it\u2019d be advantage Lowry. It sort of is match-play. Advantage Lowry, then. Fleetwood\u2019s tee shot at the par-three 13th bounds over the back of the green. Not great. Lowry meanwhile tugs his into a huge bunker to the left. Not ideal either, but it looks as though he\u2019s got a decent lie, and a splash out from sand is surely better than a chip up from the swale. What a perfectly paced putt by Shane Lowry! He rolls his ball 50 feet up the green, sending it to rest just to the left of the cup. So nearly a sensational birdie, but he\u2019d have taken two putts for his par. That suddenly puts a little bit of pressure on Fleetwood\u2019s eagle effort. He surely needs to go for it, but can\u2019t afford to trundle it way past. So he underhits it! It\u2019s two feet short! That is incredibly poor in the circumstances. Then again, it is a birdie in difficult conditions, and suddenly Lowry\u2019s lead is only - only! - four. Here\u2019s the top-ten countdown. -15: Lowry (12) -11: Fleetwood (12) -7: Finau (15), Westwood (14) -6: Willett (14), Fowler (13), Koepka (13) -5: MacIntyre (F), Hatton (F) -4: Reed (F) Now then. Lowry wedges in from 110 yards. It only just reaches the green. He\u2019s left with a long birdie putt up. Having made three bogeys in the last four holes, these are worrying times for Ireland\u2019s hero. Lowry chops back onto the fairway. The door slightly ajar for Fleetwood. And he sends a long iron into the heart of the green, allowing the camber on the left to bring his ball pin high to 30 feet. Meanwhile the JB Holmes horror show continues to unfold. He sends his second at 12 into awful muck at the back of the green, and though they find his ball, he\u2019s forced to take an unplayable. His second double bogey of the day, to go along with a triple, and having started at -10 this afternoon, he\u2019s tumbled in extremely ungainly fashion all the way down to level par. The crowd falls quiet, as they wonder whether the tide could be dramatically turning. On the par-five 12th, Fleetwood bashes a lovely drive down the middle. Lowry\u2019s tee shot sails off to the right and disappears into the freak kale. Much may depend on how both players respond to this position. Can Fleetwood parlay this advantage into something meaningful on the scoreboard? Or will Lowry escape from a tight spot and refuse to give ground? News of Lee Westwood, who you\u2019ll have noticed has slipped to -7. Bogeys at 11, 12 and now 13, and his week is beginning to unravel. Perhaps, having allowed himself to dream the unexpected dream, the will has now gone. After so many disappointments in the majors, you can kind of understand it. A little boost for Justin Rose, though. He\u2019d bogeyed 3, 6, 8, 9 and 11 to tumble down the rankings, but he strokes in a 20-footer on 12 to rise to -4. Back with the final pairing. Lowry and Fleetwood are both on the green in regulation, but both have long putts for birdie. Fleetwood\u2019s never looks like dropping, but he taps in for par. Lowry\u2019s takes off as it leaves the face of his putter, though, and speeds eight feet past the hole. He\u2019s left with a knee-knocker coming back. He pulls it left, perhaps his worst stroke of the week, and that\u2019s his fourth bogey of the day, his third in the last four. The lead is down to five, which looks like a done deal, but when you\u2019re chasing your first major, nothing is certain. -15: Lowry (11) -10: Fleetwood (11) -7: Finau (14), Willett (13), Westwood (13), Fowler (11) -6: Koepka (11) Up on 18, Patrick Reed ends with a level-par 71. He\u2019s -4 after his week\u2019s work. His playing partner Justin Thomas signs for a 72 and he\u2019s -3. Not looking too happy, either, after that triple on 17 cost him a few places. Henrik Stenson and Alex Noren take turns to bogey 14; they\u2019re both -4. And a bogey for Danny Willett on 13, and he\u2019s -7 again. With the wind up - and more rain heading this way, by all accounts - quite a few of the folk in the clubhouse will find themselves in very healthy positions come the end of play. Brooks Koepka struggles his way up 11. He nearly salvages the situation with a long par saver, but the ball stops a turn short. It\u2019s his first bogey since that horror four-bogey start, and he slips back to -6. He\u2019s having a shocker, though nothing compared to his playing partner JB Holmes, who at one point was spotted up the left of 11, his head barely poking out the top of the tall rough, squirting a wedge straight right and into the punters on the other side. He runs up a triple bogey, and clatters all the way down to -2. Lowry splits the fairway at 11. Fleetwood finds the semi-rough down the left. Meanwhile on 12, Westwood three-putts from distance, and he trudges off knowing all hopes of an unlikely fairytale are thoroughly extinguished now. Finau overshoots the green at the par-three 13th and it costs him a shot; he\u2019s -7 again. And a birdie for Willett, who snatches back the shot he\u2019d dropped at 11. -16: Lowry (10) -10: Fleetwood (10) -8: Willett (12), Westwood (12) -7: Finau (13), Fowler (11), Koepka (10) ... pulls his par putt to the left. \u201cIt was almost classic match-play,\u201d notes Laura Davies on Sky. She\u2019s not wrong. Lowry looked in a little bother there, but sunk his putt and turned all the pressure onto his opponent. And suddenly there are six shots in it again! That could have been the moment that sealed the deal for Lowry. -16: Lowry (10) -10: Fleetwood (10) Neither Lowry nor Fleetwood can find the fairway at 10. And neither can find the green in regulation. Fleetwood bumps his third up from the front to four feet, and will have great chance of saving his par. Lowry gives himself a bit of work to do by chunking a chip from a tufty bank just over the back. He\u2019s got a six-footer across a seriously sloping green. But in it goes! That\u2019s a brilliant putt in the circumstances, and suddenly the pressure\u2019s back on Fleetwood, who ... Tony Finau moves into fourth spot after birdie at 12. He\u2019s -8 and on course for his second top-five finish in this year\u2019s majors - he was tied fifth at Augusta - and consecutive top-ten finishes at the Open, having tied for ninth at Carnoustie last year. Danny Willett will soon join him, following bogey at 11 by nearly slam-dunking his approach into the cup at 12. He\u2019ll tidy up for a bounce-back birdie. Tyrrell Hatton threatened to challenge at times this week, but never quite maintained the required consistency. He\u2019s had a fine four rounds regardless, and signs today for a 69. He\u2019s in the clubhouse at -5, alongside Bob MacIntyre, and the pair are currently looking good for an invite back next year. Meanwhile the 2016 champ Henrik Stenson, who had stumbled out in 39, has since birdied 10 and now 13. He\u2019s -5. With some proper links weather having finally rocked up at this year\u2019s Open, just in time, a few players are moving backwards. Bogey for Finau at 11; he\u2019s -7. Willett follows bogey at 9 with another at 11; he\u2019s -7 too. A double for Fowler at 10; he\u2019s -7 and has just hooked his tee shot at 11 into green mince. And Thomas, who had been going along nicely, bogeys 13 then runs up a triple at 17 after losing a ball. He\u2019s -3. Lowry gives his putt a little bit too much on the left. That\u2019s back-to-back bogeys for the leader, and he turns in level-par 36. Fleetwood knocks in his par effort, and he turns in 37. Just (!) the five in it now. Meanwhile Westwood, who had birdied 10, hands the shot straight back at 11. -16: Lowry (9) -11: Fleetwood (9) -9: Westwood (11) Lowry demonstrates the importance of taking your medicine when you\u2019re in the jungle. He arrows his third from 140 yards to 15 feet, straight at the flag. A decent chance to save his par. And he\u2019ll want to make it, because Fleetwood clips a wedge up the big green and spins his ball to a halt a couple of feet from the flag. It should be a birdie. It should be. Lowry can only punch out from the rough. Fleetwood\u2019s lie isn\u2019t so bad, and he\u2019s able to lash an iron towards the green, though the wind is so strong, covering the distance is beyond him. The rain has stopped again, so that\u2019s something. Yet another bogey for JB Holmes, this time at 9. He\u2019s -5. His partner Brooks Koepka bangs a long par saver into the cup, and walks off smiling broadly. Having turned in 38 after that opening four-bogey salvo, he\u2019s out of this - he\u2019s -7 - but you sense that he\u2019s enjoying the challenge of these conditions. He\u2019s a born competitor. Having missed a short putt on the last hole, Lowry sends an iron into the deep rough down the right side of 9. He looks a little rattled after that bogey hit him out of nowhere. But if you must feel rattled, best it happens when you\u2019re six shots ahead. And it\u2019s not as though Fleetwood is threatening to launch any sort of charge. He follows him into the same patch of rough. Meanwhile scrub that bit about the weather easing off. The rain\u2019s suddenly back with a vengeance. The players clamber into their waterproofs en masse. Fleetwood\u2019s approach at 8 is a good 15 feet short of the flag. He can\u2019t save his par. But now it\u2019s Lowry\u2019s turn to let his opponent off with one, as he three-putts for a bogey of his own. Meanwhile up on 10, Westwood birdies, the reward for a lovely second guided in off the left-hand bank to eight feet. The weather\u2019s eased off a little, by the way. Thank goodness. -17: Lowry (8) -11: Fleetwood (8) -10: Westwood (10) -9: Fowler (9) Shank! The next time it happens to you, please remember it can happen to the best of them. And on 9, having been forced to chip back onto the fairway after finding trouble off the tee, Justin Rose smacks one off the hosel. Straight right. The 2013 US Open champion ends up with double bogey. He\u2019s -4, turning in five-over 41. A tempest is raging now. This is links golf! This is the Open! This is summer on these glorious isles! Good lord. Here\u2019s hoping the greens don\u2019t start collecting too much of this water. Fleetwood\u2019s all over the show from the tee. He sends another wild one into mutant cabbage, this time to the left of 8. He\u2019d just witnessed Lowry drive into a spot of trouble on the other side of the hole, so in his position that\u2019s inexcusable really. He\u2019s got little or no margin for error. Lowry, the pressure off, is able to whip an iron up towards the green ... and onto the front. A bit of a fortunate bounce left so he avoids some sand, but you earn your luck in this business. Then it\u2019s Fleetwood\u2019s turn, and all he can do is lash back out onto the fairway. So as things stand, he\u2019s six shots plus 100 yards behind. Rickie Fowler rolls in a long par saver on 8, managing to get up and down from a bunker. Lee Westwood bogeys 9 to turn in 35. They\u2019re both -9. Danny Willett - going round with Westwood, just as he did when he won the Masters - drops a shot at 9 too. He\u2019s -8. Justin Rose sheds yet another shot, his third of the day, at 8. Coming after bogeys at 3 and 6, he\u2019s -6. Fleetwood\u2019s third into 7 bleeds off to the right and is snaffled by the bunker front right. The sand is thick and wet - it\u2019s really pelting down now - and he can only get his ball out to ten feet. It\u2019s a must-make, because Lowry has chipped up to a similar distance, and he\u2019ll be putting for birdie. As the rain lashes around his lugs, he rolls in a brilliant par saver. But Lowry makes his as well, deserved reward for a hole played pretty much to perfection. Birdie, and suddenly he\u2019s leading the Open by six strokes with just 11 holes to go. This isn\u2019t over ... it\u2019s never over on the last day of a major until the final putt drops ... but it really is nearly over. Shane Lowry, who threatened to wobble on the first two holes but was let off the hook by Tommy Fleetwood\u2019s missed birdie putts, is in the middle of an imperial phase right now! -18: Lowry (7) -12: Fleetwood (7) -9: Willett (8), Westwood (8), Fowler (8) -8: Finau (9) -7: Koepka (7), Holmes (7) G-Mac signs off with bogey. It\u2019s a miserable closing 77, but the crowd care not a jot, and the 2010 US Open champion - the man who kick-started Northern Ireland\u2019s astonishing run of major-championship success - is afforded the reception his career richly deserves. He looks emotional as he stares off into the middle distance. He ends the week at +4. Not ideal, but at least he made it through to the end. What Rory and Darren would give for a moment like this. Serious bother for Fleetwood at the par-five 7th. He flays his drive into the really thick oomska down the right. \u201cGet a lie!\u201d he shouts impotently. He\u2019ll be happy enough to find his ball. Lowry meanwhile clacks his down the middle. Golf is a lot easier when you\u2019ve got a five-shot lead, rather than trying to close one down, last round of the Open notwithstanding. Fleetwood manages to locate his ball, and does extremely well to bash back out onto the fairway. He needs a spark, and quick. Especially as Lowry is just off the front of the green in two. We last saw Portrush-born Graeme McDowell making birdie at 1. It\u2019s been a bit of a miserable traipse around his home course since then. Bogeys at 8, 10, 11, 12 and 16. But now there\u2019s a huge smile on his face as he walks up the last, his people giving their hero a stunning reception as he returns home after a long, arduous 72-hole journey. It\u2019s a lovely moment, to file alongside the bittersweet reception Rory McIlroy received on Friday evening. Darren Clarke also, though is triple bogey slightly took the edge off that one. Birdies elsewhere to report. Justin Thomas - whose charge had seriously stalled with bogeys at 9 and 12 - picks one back up at 13. Alex Noren birdies 9; he turns in level-par 36 after bogey at 5. He\u2019s -6. Birdie for Tony Finau at 7, who has otherwise parred every hole through 8; he\u2019s -8. And the 2016 Masters champion Danny Willett\u2019s renaissance continues; he follows birdie at 2 with another at 7, and he\u2019s -9, in a tie for fourth with Rickie Fowler. The rain is beginning to come down hard now. The wind\u2019s whipping around as well. Lowry lags a putt through it all to three feet. He marks, struggles with his umbrella, watches Fleetwood stroke in the right-to-left slider that he simply had to make, then tidies up for his own par. That up-and-down might give Fleetwood a little succour ... because, my goodness, he needs it. -17: Lowry (6) -12: Fleetwood (5) This is beginning to look more and more like a cakewalk for Lowry. He finds the heart of 6 with yet another beautifully controlled iron. No heroics, just smart course management. Fleetwood, his nearest challenger, could be more than five adrift soon, because his tee shot at the par-three is weak, short and right. He chips up the big bank to eight feet, but he\u2019ll have another testing putt to sink, and his flat stick has been resolutely tepid so far this afternoon. The young prospect and etiquette firebrand Bob MacIntyre sinks a long putt at 18, and that\u2019s a fine closing round of 68. He\u2019s -5, the new clubhouse leader. Kyle \u2018Fore!\u2019 Stanley has ended the week at +2, for the record. A fair chance the 22-year-old Scot will have earned himself an invite for Sandwich next year, because he\u2019s currently tied for 12th. He only needs a couple of players above him to struggle coming home, and he\u2019ll be in the top ten, exempt from qualifying. JB Holmes is certainly doing his best to oblige, dropping his latest shot at 6. He\u2019s got two bogeys and a double to his name already, and has toppled down the standings to -6. Fleetwood can\u2019t make his eagle putt, but the birdie takes him back to where he started the day. In relation to par, anyway. In relation to the leader, he\u2019s still one shot further behind, because Lowry matches his birdie with a calm chip up to eight feet and another ice-cool putt. -17: Lowry (5) -12: Fleetwood (5) -10: Westwood (6) -9: Fowler (6) We mentioned Sergio earlier, just because. He\u2019s back home now, having shot 78. Oh dear. He ends the week +6, having clearly given up. Though I maintain the provisional he hit into 7, that didn\u2019t count because he then found his first ball, was one of the shots of the week. Justin Thomas runs up a six at 12. He slips back to -6. Bogey for Rose at 7 and he\u2019s -7, heading very much the wrong way. Fleetwood needs a response of his own. And so he nearly replicates Koepka\u2019s tee shot on 5. He\u2019ll be left with a 15-footer for eagle. Lowry\u2019s tee shot lands soft and doesn\u2019t reach the green. Once they\u2019ve teed off, the players in the group ahead - who stand aside as the ones following play up - take their putts. Par for Holmes, but Koepka rolls in his eagle effort to climb back to -7. He\u2019s started bogey-bogey-bogey-bogey-eagle. There\u2019s a fair chance he\u2019s never done that in his life before. What price going on a run like that in the final round of the Open Championship?! The momentum is back with Lowry now! Fleetwood rolls an excellent putt up to the cup on 4, but it stubbornly refuses to drop. It\u2019s a thin line between success and failure. And Lowry doesn\u2019t pass up his birdie chance. In it goes, up go the gallery, and suddenly the leader has a five-shot cushion! -16: Lowry (4) -11: Fleetwood (4) -10: Westwood (6) The cream always rises. And just after Brooks Koepka makes it a scarcely believable fourth bogey out of four holes, he whips an iron off the tee at the short par-four 5th. He sends his ball scampering into the green and turning towards the hole off the camber on the left. It\u2019s a stunning shot of textbook links brilliance, and he\u2019ll be left with a six-footer for eagle. Shane Lowry has definitely relocated his mojo. He sends a gentle draw into 4, sending his ball over the hillock guarding the pin and landing it eight feet short of the flag. That\u2019s glorious. Fleetwood\u2019s second is pin high, but a good 30 feet to the left. Here\u2019s Simon McMahon, apropos nothing: \u201cWhile we\u2019re reminiscing, my first set of golf clubs had hickory shafts, and included a gold - at least my dad told me it was gold - Julius Boros putter. Like most of us, I used to imagine that the tricky 12-foot right-to-left breaker on the final green of the local nine-hole course was for the Open. And like most of us, I quickly realised that serious golf was best left to the professionals. Which is why I now spend 16 days of the year emailing the HBH.\u201d Lowry looks to have settled after his shaky sorties up the first two holes. He creams a 3-wood down the middle of 4. The pressure\u2019s suddenly on Fleetwood, who must be ruing those two missed birdie putts on 1 and 2. A chance to really put his shoe on Lowry\u2019s neck. But the hunted escaped the hunter. Fleetwood does very well to follow Lowry down the fairway, avoiding the many bunkers in the road. Meanwhile on 5, birdie for Westwood, who like Fowler behind him has responded well to an opening-hole setback: birdies at 2, 3 and 5. He\u2019s -10, five off Lowry\u2019s lead and just one off Fleetwood in second. Two easy putts for Lowry to secure his par on 3. Fleetwood lobs up to six feet, a fine result from where he was, but he\u2019s left with a tester for par. It\u2019s straight, but the wind is whipping across the green. He sends it out left, and it\u2019s never coming back. The gap at the top is four again. \u201cJustin Rose recently pitched up in the promo for the unveiling of Chelsea\u2019s new away strip for the coming season,\u201d reports Ian Burch. \u201cAlong with Omid Djalili, Phil Daniels, Trevor Nelson and legendary Chelsea hard-man Ron \u2018Chopper\u2019 Harris, Justin has a brief cameo strolling along the King\u2019s Rd. Oddly enough Chopper used to own and run a golf course in Swindon. It would be nice to think that Chopper brought his attitude to playing the beautiful game to his role of managing a provincial golf course.\u201d -15: Lowry (3) -11: Fleetwood (3) -9: Westwood (4), Fowler (4) Fleetwood pushes his tee shot at the par-three 3rd just off the right of the green. Lowry finds the dancefloor, though his ball briefly teases him, rolling dangerously close to the roll-off area that would funnel it down a massive bank. Meanwhile it\u2019s three birdies in a row for Rickie Fowler, who rattles in a magical 15-footer on 4! He\u2019s -9! This is quite something from the Californian, who must wonder what he has to do to win a major title, and will have really felt the blow as his opening tee shot sliced out of bounds. A response that gives him every chance should Lowry and Fleetwood stumble. No birdie for Lowry. And for the second hole in a row, Fleetwood spurns the chance of cranking up the pressure on his opponent, as he lets his another birdie effort slip by. Bogey for Rose at 3; he\u2019s back to -8. Thomas\u2019s charge stalls with bogey at 9. He\u2019s still out in 33, but back to -7. And almost unbelievably, Koepka makes it three bogeys in the first three holes, and his chances are severely compromised now. He\u2019s -6. -15: Lowry (2) -12: Fleetwood (2) -9: Westwood (4) -8: Willett (4), Fowler (3), Rose (3), Holmes (3) -7: Thomas (10), Finau (4) -6: Frittelli (7), Spieth (6), Koepka (3) When Darren Clarke won the Open at Sandwich in 2011, he benefited from a huge stroke of good fortune in the final round. On the 9th, he thinned his second shot from rough down the left towards some fairway bunkers. Real trouble there. But instead of plugging into the sand, his ball hit a small incline just in front, kicked up over the trap, and whistled its way to the green. He parred, and the rest is history. So could this be a sign on 2? His fellow Irishman Shane Lowry doesn\u2019t connect well with his second shot from rough down the left towards a fairway bunker ... and it just clears. That allows him to wedge onto the green, from where he\u2019ll take a look at birdie from 12 feet. His partner Fleetwood will be doing the same after powering out of tall grass and wedging on himself. Koepka lobs up marvellously and nearly hits the flagstick. But his ball bounds 12 feet on. Big par putt coming back. He can\u2019t make it. Back-to-back bogeys for the major-championship specialist, and he\u2019s -7, his hopes quickly going in the same direction as the wind: south. Par for Holmes, who stays at -8. Belated news of birdie for Danny Willett at 2; he\u2019s -8. And another birdie for Rickie Fowler, the result of a glorious tee shot at 3 to ten feet! He\u2019s repaired all the damage made by his opening drive! He\u2019s -8 and simply refusing to buckle. You have got to love Rickie Fowler. To be fair, the Portrush punters certainly do. Koepka struggles his way up the par-five 2nd. He drives into sand, chips out, then sends an overly aggressive third through the green, down a bank, and into filth. Par will be a result from there. Back on the tee, neither Lowry nor Fleetwood can find the short grass, both going left, though Fleetwood is wilder. Already a sense that anything could happen this afternoon. Fleetwood hits a very tentative birdie putt, and it dies off to the right. He\u2019ll be happy with par, though. Especially as Lowry has dropped a shot. The leader still punches the air, though, because that bogey putt was missable. The crowd try their best to boost their man with another guttural roar. Meanwhile Fowler rebounds from his double-bogey start with birdie at 2, so he\u2019s back to -7 and fighting hard. -15: Lowry (1) -12: Fleetwood (1) -9: Westwood (3), Rose (2) Another shot goes for Jordan Spieth, this time at 4. He\u2019s going backwards, and at -6 is most likely done. Meanwhile a very nervous Lowry leaves his long par putt eight feet short. You can sense the anxiety in the crowd. And in the player. He\u2019ll be thinking about Oakmont right now, you can be sure of it. \u201cThe HBH is the only place we get references to Flann O\u2019Brien (At Swim Two Birds?) and pro-celebrity golf,\u201d writes Ewan Paton. \u201cAlso on the Irish theme, this brings back memories of a grumpy and probably hungover Alex Higgins hacking round Turnberry with Alliss, Tarby and Brucie.\u201d Don\u2019t forget Kenny Lynch. Westwood is in a spot of danger on the par-three 3rd, having shoved his tee shot down a bank to the right. He\u2019ll do well to get up and down ... and so he trundles a blind chip in! That\u2019s sent him back to -9, a huge stroke of luck that keeps him in the mix. Meanwhile back on 1, Lowry\u2019s splash out of sand bites in the middle of the green and spins back a few feet. He\u2019ll have a long putt to save his par. They\u2019re dropping like flies down the 1st. Brooks Koepka can\u2019t get up and down from the right of the 1st green, and he slips to +8. He\u2019s joined there by his partner JB Holmes, who ends up with double bogey after flying OB. And behind them, Shane Lowry can only lash from the rough into the face of the bunker guarding the front left of the green. His ball topples back in, and he\u2019ll have a tough up and down for par from there. Tommy Fleetwood cranks up the early pressure by fizzing a delightful low iron straight at the flag to ten feet. It\u2019s bedlam o\u2019clock! Shane Lowry, who in a few hours could become Ireland\u2019s fourth Open champion in the last dozen years, takes to the 1st tee along with Tommy Fleetwood. Both men get a wonderful reception, though you know which one gets the extra treatment. Fleetwood is up first, and has to wait for what will seem an absolute age until the clock ticks round to 1.47pm and he\u2019s announced. Swish swish swish with the iron. Eventually: \u201cThis is game number 37. On the tee from England ... Tommy Fleetwood.\u201d And we\u2019re off! Fleetwood clacks a nerveless iron down the middle. \u201cOn the tee, from the Republic of Ireland ... Shane Lowry!\u201d A sing-song delivery by the man from the R&amp;A. Lowry\u2019s opening shot isn\u2019t the best, hooked into the thick stuff down the left. Not the best contact. But it\u2019s not OB. So it\u2019s a double bogey for Fowler on 1. He clatters down the leaderboard in Rahmian fashion to -6. A poor tee shot at 3 costs Jordan Spieth the shot he\u2019d picked up at 2. He\u2019s where he started at -7. And par for Justin Rose at 1, so he remains at -9. The only man making any inroads at the top of the leaderboard is Justin Thomas, who is flinging the kitchen sink at this today. Birdies at 3, 4, 5 and now 7! He\u2019s zoomed up the standings to -8, which - just before the last group takes to the tee - means it\u2019s time for an update. -16: Lowry -12: Fleetwood -10: Holmes -9: Rose (1), Koepka -8: Thomas (7) Around with Alliss! Well that\u2019s me gone as well as David. There\u2019s a tear in my eye too. Memories of watching that with Dad on the old 14-inch Hitachi. A futuristic 70s number with touch buttons to change the channel. Love you, mate, see you on the other side. Ach. Ahem. Now then, we won\u2019t be going around with Rahm this afternoon, after he took two to get out of that bunker, and we\u2019ll not be bothering much with Lee Westwood either, who continues the downward momentum of yesterday afternoon by making bogey on the opening hole. Rahm is -5, Westy -7. Also buggered early doors: Rickie Fowler and JB Holmes, who send their opening drives out of bounds to the right and left respectively. It\u2019s all happening pretty much from the get-go! Scott mentioned the BBC\u2019s classic golf theme music earlier so, just before Shane Lowry completes his final warm-up, I\u2019ll counter with this from Terry Venables/Mike Yarwood hybrid Frank Mills. If this doesn\u2019t make you well up and yearn for a simpler time, you\u2019re better than me. While I dry my eyes, I\u2019ll hand back to Mr Murray to guide you through what should be a very special afternoon. It\u2019s a double bogey for Jon Rahm at 1. Paul Lawrie came from ten shots back to win in 1999 while the Spaniard started nine off the pace today, and perhaps one of the more likely candidates to pull off something ridiculous. That\u2019s surely gone now as he finds a snake rather than a ladder at the very first hole. Back to -5 and tied 14th. Jon Rahm, winner of two of the last three Irish Opens, is a hugely popular figure in these parts and the decibel levels spike as the Spaniard is announced on to the tee. A muscular swing of the club promotes a right old roar except his ball trickles rather apologetically into a bunker. Meanwhile, the hot man on the course is American Ryder Cup star Justin Thomas, who goes birdie-birdie-birdie at 3, 4 and 5 to jump to 7-under. The 2017 USPGA winner issued a paean to Portrush after seeing it for the first time earlier this week and the love affair continues to blossom as he schmoozes his way into the top ten. Francesco Molinari completes his reign as Open champion with a beautifully-executed round of 66. The Claret Jug will have to be handed back but the Italian has signed off in style today with three birdies and an eagle. He never threatened to repeat last year\u2019s Carnoustie heroics but a solid week nonetheless and he can now head for a flat white in \u2018Caffe Molinari\u2019, a popular spot in the heart of the Royal Portrush. Patrick Reed, who has the same unexpectedly dainty movements as Oliver Hardy, makes birdie at 2 to advance his score to 5-under. That makes up for the birdie opportunity the 2018 Masters champion missed at the par-5 2nd when he presumably gave a withering look to camera. But it\u2019s another fine mess for fellow American Andrew Putnam on Royal Portrush\u2019s early holes. Putnam needed six swishes on the 2nd yesterday and he makes double at his opening hole today. Hard boiled eggs and nuts. Pictures on Sky just now of a smiling Shane Lowry crossing the temporary bridge to the course. Hands in pockets, he looks like someone heading out for a four-ball with a few mates. Body language experts now discussing whether he looks too casual. Hello. While Scott pumps out a 5k followed by a series of weights and lunges, I\u2019ll take the baton. I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m watching the Met office\u2019s Royal Portrush weather forecast with the same steely-eyed focus that I used to reserve for taxi meters until Uber came along. Looking at the hourly updates, we have 80% chance of rain at 1pm and 2pm before that percentage drops to 20 for a couple of hours before picking up again. But those wind speeds look locked in at just under 20mph and could gust to 30mph. This is a test, as someone once said. The rain is beginning to come down. So I\u2019m off to find an umbrella. In the meantime, David Tindall, like a pint of plain, is your only man. See you again soon! It\u2019s about time Scotland had another golfer mixing it with the very best at the majors. Robert MacIntyre could be the very man! The 22-year-old from Oban is making his Open debut this week, and it\u2019s been a fine performance. Rounds of 68, 72 and 71, and he\u2019s on the right road today as well after birdies at 2 and 7. Throw in his willingness to face down Kyle Stanley over fore!gate - hey, he played shinty in his youth, he\u2019ll be afraid of the square root of bugger all - and this is a very impressive young man. Major championship one day, please, Bob! No pressure, though. No pressure at all. He\u2019s -4. Tom Lewis\u2019s signature round at the Open will most likely always be the record-breaking 65 he shot as an amateur at Sandwich in 2011. Unless he goes on to win the Championship one day, of course. That won\u2019t be happening this week, but the 28-year-old from Welwyn Garden City is having a good one nevertheless. Birdies at 4 and 5 today have whisked him up the standings to -4. Good signs for the future. After a shaky start to his pro career, he enjoyed by far his best season on the European Tour last year, and it looks as though he\u2019ll do even better this time round. All that early promise was no mirage. Progress isn\u2019t always linear. News of some other early starters who, like Kiradech Aphibarnrat, will be pleased with their final day\u2019s work. The 23-year-old Englishman Ashton Turner, making his second appearance at an Open after missing the cut last year at Carnoustie, was out first this morning with a marker. He shot a fine 68 and ends the week at +4. Shubhankar Sharma finishes with a 68 as well, the young Indian\u2019s first sub-70 score at the Open in eight rounds. He\u2019s +3. And the aforementioned Jason Kokrak concludes his week with 68; he\u2019s +1. Early birdies for Justin Harding, Erik van Rooyen and Tyrrell Hatton. All three have risen to -4. A shot behind, also having picked up an early stroke: Dustin Johnson, Tom Lewis and Bob MacIntyre. Ryan Fox, who played the back nine in a record-breaking 29 strokes on Thursday, birdies 8 and 11 to move to -2. And a bogey for Doc Redman at 11; he slips back to -3. Only four pars for the Doc today. He\u2019s got game. For what this is worth - and that is not very much at all - the early clubhouse leader is Kiradech Aphibarnrat of Thailand. The ever-entertaining everyman was in the mix on Thursday after a round of 68, but subsequent knocks of 73 and 77 clattered him down the standings. But a crowd-pleasing final round of 67 - five birdies, an eagle and three bogeys - means he finishes the week at +1. He\u2019s so good to watch. \u201cThe only thing that could improve on the perfection of that theme tune,\u201d replies Robin Durie, \u201cwould be the voice of Henry Longhurst introducing coverage of the day\u2019s play, over panning shots of dreich, windswept, Fife links, punctuated by occasional colourful spots of drookit players\u2019 waterproofs.\u201d Here\u2019s Sergio in a nutshell. Having just driven out of bounds on 5, he shanks his second at the par-five 7th into extremely thick nonsense up the bank to the right of the hole. That could be lost. He immediately drops a provisional ... and creams one of the shots of the week into the front of the green, his ball slowly rolling towards the cup in statesmanlike fashion. It stops a couple of rolls short. That\u2019s the most elegant shot of the week! Sadly, it counts for absolutely nothing, as some pesky marshal has found his first ball. So instead of saving par, he\u2019s chipping down the hill from the filth and running up a bogey. He\u2019s +2. Also now four under for his round: the aforementioned Doc Redman. This impressive young man has an interest in calculus, and perhaps he utilised his mathematical mind to calculate the bounce off the bank to the left of the 10th green. His ball cannons right and rolls gently towards the lip of the hole, where it frustratingly stops. That would have been sensational. No eagle, but birdie will suffice, and he\u2019s -4, suddenly in the top 20 as things stand at this early stage. The hottest player on the course: the outgoing champion Francesco Molinari. He\u2019s putting together a lovely valedictory round, with birdies at 2 and 7, and now an eagle at 12. He\u2019s -2, and can be proud of his defence this week, even if an opening-day 74 meant he never had a realistic chance of becoming the first player since Padraig Harrington in 2008 to retain the Claret Jug. There could be some fun and games at the risk-reward short par-four 5th today. Go for the green and a possible eagle? Plenty chasing will need to. But there\u2019s danger, amply illustrated by our old pal Sergio Garcia, who creams such a good drive that it hits a downslope right in front of the green and bounds through, past the out-of-bounds markers just behind. Oh Sergio. The resulting double takes him down to +1. He was never able to build on that opening-day 68. The demons of 2007 and 2014 are still on the loose. \u201cYour post about Joost invites the observation that you regularly perform ekphrastically in your HbH musings,\u201d begins Robin Durie. \u201cAllow me to offer you that observation, cheerfully. In fact, your sole ekphrastic missteps have been taken in the revelation of your inexplicable adoration for American TV broadcasters\u2019 preference for sickly musical schmaltz to accompany their leaderboards/montages/intervals.\u201d Hey, there\u2019s no accounting for taste. The heart wants what it wants. But we can both agree that this one - penned by the drummer from Cliff and the Shadows, no less - is an absolute banger, right? Until Shane Lowry tees it up high and turns his shoulders in anger, there\u2019s Graeme McDowell to keep the crowds entertained. Portrush\u2019s finest warm-up act rips his opening drive down the fairway, then spins through 360 degrees to wave at his adoring fans. It\u2019s a very graceful twirl, reminiscent of Serena on Centre Court. Anyway, the gallery will have a lot of hooting and hollering to do later, but they exercise their tonsils by roaring as G-Mac knocks his second to 12 feet, and whooping when he rolls in a right-to-left slider for an opening birdie. He\u2019s -3. Wow that\u2019s loud! Goodness knows what it\u2019s going to be like later. Actually, no prizes for guessing. Doc Redman is a star in the making. The 21-year-old North Carolinian made it to the Open by snatching a place at the recent inaugural Rocket Mortgage Classic with a 62 in qualifying, then coming second in the actual event to earn his ticket to Portrush. After three level-par rounds of 71, he\u2019s looking to make some late in-roads into red figures, and has this morning followed up an opening bogey with birdies at 2, 3, 5 and 7. And now he\u2019s just rattled in a tramliner on 8 to save his par and keep things moving along. He\u2019s -3. And yes, his real name is Doc, it\u2019s not short for anything. His sister\u2019s called Karma. The 2009 dream-wrecker Stewart Cink is enjoying something of a late-career renaissance. After a decade in the doldrums following his slaying of Bambi\u2019s mum Tom Watson at Turnberry, the 46-year-old Alabaman tied for 24th at Carnoustie last summer, then registered a fine top-five finish at the PGA. He\u2019s going along very nicely this morning too, with birdies at 2, 5 and 7. He\u2019s -3, and suddenly nudging the top 20. Meanwhile as I was writing the previous entry, this request from Beatrice De Hartogh dropped into my in-box. \u201cPlease mention my compatriot, Joost Luiten, who is on a roll this morning!\u201d We aim to please, Beatrice, even if we\u2019re not consciously aware of it. Further proof of the telepathic, almost telekinetic, relationship the Guardian has with its readership. The Athletic can\u2019t buy this sort of thing. Willebrordus Adrianus Maria Luiten - also known as Joost, to the blessed relief of live bloggers around the world - started out as a ski jumper. But he had a bad fall as a ten-year-old, breaking both elbow and nose, and so transferred his talents to the meat golf. Winter sport\u2019s loss is golf\u2019s gain, and the 33-year-old Dutchman has started out today with birdies at 2, 3 and 5. Now, eagle-eyed readers will note that I\u2019ve just cut and pasted, word for word, this entry from yesterday\u2019s HBH, merely adding an extra birdie at 3. He\u2019s pretty much doing exactly the same thing again. So think of today\u2019s entry as an example of ekphrasis, one medium of art rhetorically reflecting another, a bit like Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts by WH Auden. I\u2019ll be up front with you, I\u2019m killing time until the real action begins. Adam Hadwin is the joint holder of the record for number of consecutive birdies at the US Open. He carded six on the bounce at Erin Hills back in 2017. The 31-year-old Canada-born Canadian is fond of a hot streak, being one of only 25 men or women to card a sub-60 round on official Tour business (a 59 at the tournament formerly known as the Bob Hope Desert Classic in 2017). He\u2019s not quite on that form today, but birdies at 1 and 2 plus eagle at 7 isn\u2019t half bad. Admittedly this entry would pack more narrative punch had he not just bogeyed 9, but you work with what you have, and he turns in 34. He\u2019s level par for the tournament. Some of the early starters have been making scores. Jason Kokrak is only here this weekend thanks to a fine long curling birdie putt made on 18 on Friday evening. Having scraped just inside the cut, he\u2019s taking full advantage today. Birdies at 3, 5, 6, 7 and now 12, with just the one dropped stroke at 8, have sent the Canada-born American up to level par. Whatever happens, he\u2019ll record his best finish at the Open, having failed to make the cut at Carnoustie last year on his only other visit. Here we go, then, the day of truth for Shane Lowry, Tommy Fleetwood, JB Holmes, Brooks Koepka and Justin Rose. Other golfers are available, of course, they\u2019re just more than seven shots back at the moment. But nothing is impossible. Twenty years ago, Jean van de Velde famously gave up a 54-hole five-shot lead, allowing Paul Lawrie to come back from ten behind to win after play-off. So should Lowry stumble today, and, say, Jordan Spieth (-7), fly through the pack, shooting something in the low 60s, we\u2019d witness something pretty strange. And yet stranger things will still have happened. The chasing pack need some help from the weather, though, and a few spots of rain are beginning to come down. According to the forecast, there\u2019ll be outbreaks until 1pm or so, at which point it\u2019ll clear up, before really coming down around 4pm. The wind will be a factor throughout the day, and it\u2019ll get stronger as it goes on. So in theory the early starters have it better. But there\u2019s a lot of ground to make up. So many variables. So much drama in store! Shane Lowry shot a flawless course-record 63 yesterday. As a result he\u2019s four shots clear of second-placed Tommy Fleetwood after 54 holes of the 148th Open Championship. Six clear of third-placed JB Holmes. Seven clear of Brooks Koepka and Justin Rose. He\u2019s in the form of his life, attacking pins with forensic precision, chipping and putting like a dream. He knows Portrush like the back of his hand, and he\u2019ll have the support of pretty much everyone at this famous old links today. Everything suggests he\u2019ll be the one lifting the Claret Jug for Ireland later this afternoon. It\u2019s never quite as easy as that, though, is it? For a start, Lowry\u2019s trying to win the first major of his career. He may well have had a sleepless night, considering how he\u2019s been in this position before, four clear going into the final round of the 2016 US Open at Oakmont. He stumbled to a 76 that day. The love of the home gallery comes with added pressure. He\u2019ll also want to avoid the stigma of shipping a big lead on the 20th anniversary of Jean van de Velde\u2019s infamous collapse at Carnoustie, the Frenchman having tossed away a five-shot, third-round advantage in 1999. And then there\u2019s the incoming wind and rain, which could wreak unpredictable havoc. Koepka, in hot pursuit, nearly tossed away a seven-stroke lead of his own at the PGA a couple of months ago, and was more than happy to spell out the dangers that lie ahead for Lowry. \u201cThe last time Shane had the lead at Oakmont we saw what happened. In links golf, all of a sudden you get a couple of bad bounces or get in a couple of bunkers. At Bethpage it went very quickly. Bad weather happened. The last 15 holes were very, very windy, especially that back nine.\u201d If a steely-eyed operator like Koepka can feel the heat, anyone can, so nothing\u2019s certain. But hey. If Lowry keeps his cool like he did yesterday afternoon amid an emotional storm, and draws on his experience playing in a real one - let\u2019s be fair, he\u2019ll have played a fair few rounds in Irish wind and rain before - he\u2019ll take some catching. One way or another, it promises to be one of the most memorable days in the entire history of Irish golf. God speed, everyone, and may the best man drink liberally from the auld jug tonight.

The race was defined by faultless baton changes and a dominant third leg from Richard Kilty, the 29-year-old informally known as the Teesside Tornado. Kilty described the performance, which is also the team\u2019s fastest since 2017, as \u201camazing\u201d and said: \u201cWe had fun and were relaxed and were able to let loose on every leg.\u201d</p> <p>There was another world best time recorded in the women\u2019s 5,000m race, where Kenya\u2019s Hellen Obiri emerged from a tough duel to win in 14:20.36.

I look at it now, six shots back, but the last three or four holes were kind of a bit of a procession for Shane and he did great.

You learn things about yourself.\u201d</p> <p>He said of Lowry, \u201cHe never lost control of himself. He made some key putts at key times. He did better in those moments than I did today.

To miss one birdie putt is forgivable; to miss three in a row then an eagle chance proved expensive. When he did birdie the 5th, a 374\u2011yard par-four clinging to the cliffs as if in an oil painting, Lowry matched him to retain his five\u2011shot lead. Still, Fleetwood\u2019s safety-first golf \u2013 straight driving, sensible use of the irons and decent concentration with the flat stick \u2013 had enabled him to stay in punching distance of the gentle bear from Offaly on Saturday.

As Fleetwood had said the night before: \u201cI\u2019ve had some of my best rounds in terrible, terrible conditions, where I\u2019ve enjoyed grinding it out. And Shane definitely has not played all his life in sunshine and no wind.\u201d</p> <p>Fleetwood found a greenside bunker on the par-five 7th and needed a solid putt from about six feet across the soaked grass to save his par \u2013 and again Lowry birdied, after a sublime chip that left him a tiddler to convert. Driving into a wet howler on Curran Point, the monster par-five 8th with the stunning backdrop, Fleetwood lost control of the shot and found the rough, tucked in behind a knoll 154 yards from the flag. He could do no more than hack his way back on to the fairway, then bogeyed \u2013 as did Lowry for the second time in his round.</p> <p>Little wonder. The wet stuff went from wretchedly uncomfortable to mini-tempest and the gallery took on the look of sinners doing penance.</p> <p>When the leaders turned for home, wetter than a washing machine, there was a pause in the rain and they shared the course with 20 others still battling away in front of them. A double bogey put a serious hole in Fleetwood\u2019s score and he was now looking over his shoulder at Lee Westwood rather than chasing Lowry, who remained five clear of him after his own bogey, completing the front nine in 36, one stroke fewer than Fleetwood.</p> <p>The Englishman got into light rough on the left off the tee on the 10th. Negotiating a 16mph crosswind, he was not thrilled to see his ball find similar grass on the other side of the fairway and gave the course back another shot.</p> <p>With eight holes left Fleetwood trailed by six strokes, two more than when they started two and a half hours earlier, and was one shot clear of Westwood. A curious lassitude fell on the event as if there was nothing anyone could do to alter the course of the non-contest.</p> <p>This was not anyone\u2019s fault but neither hunter nor hunted moved the dial much. Not even a Lowry bogey on the 11th and a Fleetwood birdie on the 12th \u2013 shrinking the Irishman\u2019s lead to four with six holes left \u2013 aroused much concern among the trekkers who on Saturday had created more noise than a house party.</p> <p>If day three was one of premature celebration for Offaly and \u201cthe island of Ireland\u201d, as Graeme McDowell sagely remarked, the afternoon of day four was what the French call <em>la petite mort</em>.</p> <p>The applause gathered force again, however, as the tournament wound down to its correct conclusion, a triumph for Lowry, a minor disappointment for Fleetwood, who never did enough to worry Lowry.

Thanks for joining me, and congratulations New Zealand.</p> <p>New Zealand held off an Australian fightback to win their first Netball World Cup since 2003 with a dramatic 52-51 triumph in Liverpool. <br></p> <p>The Silver Ferns\u2019 success completed a recent revival after they had failed to medal for the first time at last year\u2019s Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast.<br></p> <p>Leading by six points midway through the penultimate quarter, the underdogs saw their lead begin to dwindle and a pair of late interceptions from Casey Kopua proved crucial in protecting their lead.</p> <p>Their win, which was greeted by a court invasion from substitutes and team staff, brought immediate retribution for the single-goal defeat they had suffered to the same team in the group stages on Thursday.</p> <p>And it gave them their first world title since their win over the Australians in Kingston, Jamaica in 2003 - since when their opponents had turned the tables with three consecutive crowns.</p> <p>New Zealand coach Noeline Taurua said: \u201cOur country and our clubs all had to be on board to pull the best out and strengthen our competition and it was case of method to madness. <br></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long process and we\u2019ve come through different stages and I\u2019m so happy that it\u2019s come to this end and we\u2019ve been able to lift the cup up.\u201d<br></p> <p>Despite their traditional dominance, Australia had headed into the tournament with questions to answer after the hurt of losing a home Commonwealth Games final to England last year.</p> <p>Those questions increased after a baffling semi-final selection decision by coach Lisa Alexander, who benched her star players and watched South Africa come within two goals of pulling off a momentous shock.</p> <p>Big names including the captain Caitlin Bassett were back for the final but New Zealand matched them through an even opening quarter then edged in front by the half-time interval.</p> <p>Maria Folau led the scoring charts for the Silver Ferns but it was the uncanny accuracy of team-mate Ameliaranne Ekensasio that began to make the difference as her team started to turn on the style.</p> <p>Kopua\u2019s brilliance stifled the inevitable Australian comeback and the Silver Ferns were able to hold onto the ball and count down the final seconds amid a fittingly raucous atmosphere in Liverpool.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-21T18:12:16.858Z\">at 7.12pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d34a8938f08cf92bb77445c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-21T18:02:46.290Z\">7.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>There are tears from the Australians as they finally get their silver medals.

      "bodyText": "New Zealand collect the trophy as the ticker tape flies. Time for me to sign off, but keep your eyes peeled for Erin\u2019s report shortly \u2013 here\u2019s a PA take for the time being. Thanks for joining me, and congratulations New Zealand. New Zealand held off an Australian fightback to win their first Netball World Cup since 2003 with a dramatic 52-51 triumph in Liverpool. The Silver Ferns\u2019 success completed a recent revival after they had failed to medal for the first time at last year\u2019s Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast. Leading by six points midway through the penultimate quarter, the underdogs saw their lead begin to dwindle and a pair of late interceptions from Casey Kopua proved crucial in protecting their lead. Their win, which was greeted by a court invasion from substitutes and team staff, brought immediate retribution for the single-goal defeat they had suffered to the same team in the group stages on Thursday. And it gave them their first world title since their win over the Australians in Kingston, Jamaica in 2003 - since when their opponents had turned the tables with three consecutive crowns. New Zealand coach Noeline Taurua said: \u201cOur country and our clubs all had to be on board to pull the best out and strengthen our competition and it was case of method to madness. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long process and we\u2019ve come through different stages and I\u2019m so happy that it\u2019s come to this end and we\u2019ve been able to lift the cup up.\u201d Despite their traditional dominance, Australia had headed into the tournament with questions to answer after the hurt of losing a home Commonwealth Games final to England last year. Those questions increased after a baffling semi-final selection decision by coach Lisa Alexander, who benched her star players and watched South Africa come within two goals of pulling off a momentous shock. Big names including the captain Caitlin Bassett were back for the final but New Zealand matched them through an even opening quarter then edged in front by the half-time interval. Maria Folau led the scoring charts for the Silver Ferns but it was the uncanny accuracy of team-mate Ameliaranne Ekensasio that began to make the difference as her team started to turn on the style. Kopua\u2019s brilliance stifled the inevitable Australian comeback and the Silver Ferns were able to hold onto the ball and count down the final seconds amid a fittingly raucous atmosphere in Liverpool. There are tears from the Australians as they finally get their silver medals. That\u2019s a long time to stand and wait for a medal you don\u2019t really want. Emotions are running high among the Silver Ferns too, as they collect gold medals that seemed a world away on the Gold Coast last year. While we wait, here\u2019s Emma John\u2019s report from England\u2019s bronze medal win, and Tracey Neville\u2019s farewell: We\u2019ve basically had the entire closing ceremony done before the medals and trophies are done. Liverpool\u2019s mayor, Joe Anderson, has just passed the baton to Cape Town, who will host in 2023. \u201cWhat an amazing tournament this has been,\u201d says Molly Rhone, president of the International Netball Federation. \u201cCongratulations especially to our winners, the Silver Ferns. What a thrilling final that was.\u201d The New Zealand, Australia and England squads are all out for the trophy and medal presentation, lining up behind a podium that runs the length of the court. \u201cCongratulations Silver Ferns,\u201d writes Pearl Matahiki. \u201cMeinga meinga \u2013Aotearoa is very proud.\u201d Here\u2019s Clare Balding to kick off the trophy presentation. She dishes out praise for New Zealand, Australia \u201cfor setting the bar so high\u201d, England for bouncing back today, and South Africa for heading a record four African teams in the top eight. There\u2019s a closing ceremony underway inside the arena, with both teams off the court and the trophy still sitting there, unclaimed. I\u2019m sure New Zealand will be back out to get it soon enough. A few stats from the final, then. New Zealand had 61 shots to Australia\u2019s 57; the Diamonds had a better shot accuracy overall, while Maria Folau was the top scorer with 28. Both teams intercepted five times, while Australia conceded more turnovers (19-15). Perhaps the most telling statistic is penalties \u2013 Australia with 82, NZ with 49. New Zealand have a population of less than five million. They\u2019ve won World Cups in rugby union, rugby league, netball \u2013 and so nearly cricket, too. Not forgetting a mighty haul of sailing silverware. Are they, as a nation, the biggest sporting overachievers on the planet? The trophy presentation is coming up. What a terrific performance that was from New Zealand \u2013 they knew it might be their last shot and used every last drop of experience to hold off Australia\u2019s late charge. Not forgetting that they had a marathon battle against the hosts barely 24 hours ago. That trophy has been won the hard way. A reminder that at last year\u2019s Commonwealth Games, New Zealand didn\u2019t even claim a medal. They lost two group games, were thrashed in the semi final by Australia \u2013 and lost the bronze medal game to Jamaica. In the final, meanwhile, Australia lost to England by a score of 52-51. Lisa Alexander, the Australia coach, is putting on a brave face after that defeat, talking of fine margins. They lost by one goal, but Alexander\u2019s decision to shuffle the team for the semi-final, and her half-time changes, will come under scrutiny. Australia lost their lead at the end of the first quarter and never got it back. Casey Kopua, playing her last NZ game after coming back from retirement, is on the verge of tears. \u201cIt feels so good \u2013 I can\u2019t really find the words. Go the Fossils!\u201d Here\u2019s Noeline Taurua, the winning coach: \u201cI\u2019m quite speechless, I don\u2019t know what to say. Our fossils stood up for us today! For us to come out and win this, it\u2019s huge for our netball community, and for New Zealand.\u201d Her contract runs out tomorrow; safe to say there\u2019ll be an extension in the post. Wow. What a performance. What an upset! No World Cup heartache for New Zealand this Sunday. New Zealand keep the ball under enormous pressure, Laura Langman unflappable on the ball \u2013 and Australia just cannot force a turnover. The hooter sounds, and New Zealand have done it!!! Q4 00:30 Aus 51-52 NZ Tippett with another goal \u2013 she\u2019s yet to miss a shot \u2013 and it\u2019s down to one! Ekenasio restores the two-goal lead, but Australia rally, and it all comes down to this... Q4 01:59 Aus 49-51 NZ Klau comes up with a big steal of her own, and Tippett cuts the gap! Two points, two minutes to go... Q4 02:20 Aus 48-51 NZ Ekanasio brings up the fifty, keeping her percentage above 90 \u2013 and then Katrina Rore with a huge steal! NZ break, Ekanasio scores another, and New Zealand have a three-point lead! Q4 03:45 Aus 48-49 NZ Australia keep pressing, chasing, but New Zealand are being so patient in attack, and Folau restores the two-goal cushion. Bassett shows great footwork and cuts it back to one. This is breathless stuff. Q4 05:00 Aus 47-48 NZ Gina Crampton finds Folau with a terrific reverse pass, and the goal shooter can\u2019t miss. Kopua, playing her last international match before retirement, nearly pulls off a vital interception, but NZ keep their noses in front... Q4 06:48 Aus 46-47 NZ The pressure is cranking up like a vice here, and Folau leaves one short. Bassett, a beacon of reliability, weighs in with two big goals \u2013 and the gap is down to one. Q4 08:29 Aus 43-46 NZ Ekenasio with a rare miss \u2013 but she moves like lightning to grab the rebound before it goes out of bounds. On the bench, Taurua is absolutely loving that \u2013 and at the other end, Kopua makes a big interception! Ekenasio adds another from range \u2013 how crucial could that passage of play be? Q4 10:06 Aus 43-44 NZ Australia just keep chipping away \u2013 they haven\u2019t led since the first quarter, but it\u2019s the end result that matters. The Diamonds are disrupting NZ\u2019s attacking flow, but Ekenasio does net a penalty to keep them in the lead. Q4 11:56 Aus 41-42 NZ No changes for New Zealand. Have they got the legs? Australia have started fast here, but Folau gets the Silver Ferns on the board. Kopua attacks Tippett at the other end, but the ball rebounds for Bassett. The gap\u2019s down to one... Q4 13:38 Aus 39-41 NZ An error from New Zealand \u2013 Folau\u2019s overthrow slipping beyond Langman. Tippett steps in under the post and the gap is down to two! Brace yourselves. There\u2019s a World Cup to be won. Lisa Alexander\u2019s Australia, or Noeline Taurua\u2019s New Zealand? Let\u2019s find out. Ian Swan isn\u2019t happy: \u201cEugh. CBass off her goals, Klau and Tippett making no difference, and the umpires picking up every infringement. Momentum with the Diamonds, but if the Ferns find some fresh legs, it\u2019s theirs to lose.\u201d Is this the start of a comeback? Bassett - the only Australian who played in the 2015 final \u2013 picks up a couple of quick points. Folau, and then Bassett, are penalised when poised to score \u2013 and Australia shuttle the ball down the court, only for Bassett to delay and run out of time. The nerves are kicking in! 15 minutes to play... Q3 02:15 Aus 35-41 NZ Klau gets another caution, this time for persistent contact. Tippett, meanwhile, has grown into the game and combines well with Bassett. Crompton with an absolute Hollywood ball over the top to Folau, and April Brandley replaces Price in wing defence. Q3 04:06 Aus 33-39 NZ Folau has been able to drift wide, collect and convert far too often in this quarter. Tippett and Bassett keep the Diamonds in range, but at the other end, NZ just aren\u2019t missing. Ekenasio keeps the gap at six, and is 94% accurate so far. Q3 06:22 Aus 30-36 NZ New Zealand look much more fluid in attack, their defence constantly denying Australia space. A better gameplan, or the effect of the Diamonds\u2019 changes in the semi-final? Q3 07:28 Aus 28-35 NZ Tippett is cautioned for persistent contact \u2013 and now Folau intercepts. Ekenasio, staying cold as ice amid the tension, finishes from the edge of the circle. Tippett gets on the score sheet, but Folau is on target again, and the lead is seven. Q3 10:00 Aus 26-32 NZ Ekenasio extends the lead to five, before Bassett tries to play in Tippett. She stumbles and hits the post. At the other end, Klau is cautioned for dissent. A rough start for Australia\u2019s newcomers, and Folau stretches the lead to six! Q3 11:53 Aus 26-30 NZ Gretel Tippett. What a name. Anyway, the new GA overthrows on her first foray forward, but does find Bassett shortly after. Klau, who featured in the semi-final, is unable to clutch the rebound from Folau\u2019s miss, and the ruthless Ekenasio pounces. Gretel Tippett replaces Steph Wood in goal attack, while Sarah Klau replaces Bruce as goal keeper. The second half is imminent. New Zealand good value for that lead, dug out right at the end of the second quarter \u2013 but can they maintain this intensity? \u201cNZ scoring seemingly at ease, whilst Australia are making hard work of everything - including defence. Diamonds in trouble unless they take corrective action,\u201d reckons Ian Swan. Liz Watson almost makes a crucial interception on Folau, but New Zealand score and then turn it over themselves. Ekenasio with a lovely arcing effort, followed up by Folau \u2013 and the Silver Ferns carve out a three-goal lead! Q2 02:00 Aus 24-24 NZ ...but Australia step up the pace to force an interception! The scoring has crept up from the first quarter, and Folau is finding her range \u2013 another inch-perfect effort, before Bassett counters from under the post. Q2 04:30 Aus 20-21 NZ Watson and goal-defence Casey Kopua are penalised for nudging Bassett, prompting boos from the Kiwis in the crowd. The high pressure from both teams is leaving gaps, and Bassett is picked out with a precise long pass from Jamie-Lee Price. Bassett then misses not once, but twice from close range... Q2 07:35 Aus 18-18 NZ A rare miss from Bassett after good work from Wood, but Australia snatch the rebound and she doesn\u2019t miss twice. Folau is left all alone and picked out by a long pass, but Bassett levels up once more. Q2 10:10 Aus 15-15 NZ There are more spaces opening up after that full-throttle first quarter. Bassett and Ekenasio both on the scoresheet twice in quick succession, still nothing to split the teams. Q2 12:08 Aus 12-12 NZ The Silver Ferns take the lead after a series of defensive fouls eventually allow Ekenasio. Steph Wood finishes from the edge of the circle to level up, before Folau\u2019s long-range shot from wide left rattles in. Bassett levels \u2013 Australia\u2019s front two yet to miss a shot. \u201cThe Kiwis\u2019 intercept game is forcing Australia to play short. Scores square at quarter-time seems entirely fair,\u201d says Ian Swan. Agreed \u2013 they\u2019ve been working relentlessly to try and force turnovers. Aus 10-10 NZ Bruce blocks Folau\u2019s latest effort but NZ keep the pressure on, with NZ captain Laura Langman triggering a fluid attack and finding Folau in acres. No mistake this time, and Ekenasio levels moments later. Australia look to break but Watson tips away from Bassett, and it\u2019s level at quarter time! Q1 02:11 Aus 10-8 NZ New Zealand get to within a point, but an attacking move breaks down. Australia break and Bassett gets a telescopic arm to a pass, before doing the necessary. Q1 04:21 Aus 9-7 NZ New Zealand are being kept under pressure, but have frustrated Bassett on a couple of occasions to keep them in range \u2013 and Ekenasio nets with a fine effort from distance. Q1 06:57 Aus 8-4 NZ This game has started at a blistering pace, both teams fighting to put pressure on the ball carrier. A clever looped pass from Steph Wood finds Bassett, before Folau lets a pass slip through her fingers. Bassett strikes again from under the post, but is denied on the next attack by the tenacious Jane Watson. Q1 09:33 Aus 6-3 NZ Bassett finishes off a flowing Australia move, and the Diamonds pounce on a defensive error to move three goals up... Q1 12:00 Aus 3-3 NZ Bassett gets the first score before Maria Folau (yes, Israel\u2019s wife) levels after a fine take. At the other end, Jane Watson intercepts to deny Bassett, but Steph Wood converts the rebound. Folau then misses a couple of chances, before Ekenasio levels it up. The Liverpool crowd save their biggest cheers for the Silver Ferns as the teams are announced. Kiwi expats, or locals rooting against Australia? Anthems time! If the coin-toss is anything to go by, we\u2019re in for a close game... Tracey Neville bows out with a third-place finish, after England powered to a 58-42 win over South Africa in the bronze medal match. It\u2019s not what they really wanted on home soil, but a medal\u2019s a medal. In case the fancy graphic is a bit hard to read... Australia: GK Bruce, GD Weston, WD Price, C Watson, WA Browne, GA Wood, GS Bassett (c). Subs: Brandley, Hadley, Klau, Thwaites, Tippett. New Zealand: GK Watson, GD Kopua, WD Rore, C Langman (c), WA Crampton, GA Ekanasio, GS Folau. Subs: Burger, Karaka, Mes, Saunders, Selby-Rickit. The teams are in! The three sweetest words in the English language: World Cup final. And this has all the ingredients to be a classic of the genre, with two old foes taking very different paths to the grand finale. This is the eighth Netball World Cup to use a knockout format, and the seventh final to feature Australia and New Zealand. Australia have won five of those six prior meetings, and have beaten their Antipodean arch-rivals in the last three finals. The Diamonds will start as clear favourites, but were pushed all the way by the Silver Ferns in their group match, before winning 50-49. Lisa Alexander\u2019s side then almost came a cropper in their semi-final with South Africa after rotating their squad. New Zealand will be much less fresh, but the adrenaline should still be surging from their dramatic win over the hosts, England, on Saturday. In a World Cup peppered with close finishes, don\u2019t bet against another today.",

      "bodyText": "Everything was different, yet oh so familiar, in the Wallabies\u2019 frustrating 35-17 loss to the South African Springboks in the opening round of The Rugby Championship in Johannesburg yesterday. And this was the South African B team, Springboks coach Rassie Erasmus electing to send an advance party to New Zealand to prepare for this Saturday\u2019s Test against the All Blacks. Nearly seven months in the making, Wallabies coach Michael Cheika unveiled Australia\u2019s new attacking strategy, which had been a closely guarded secret. From the over-complicated and highly-structured attacking style of former assistant coach Stephen Larkham, the Wallabies\u2019 game-plan seemed to revolve around one simple tactic \u2013 give the ball to inside-centre Samu Kerevi. Kerevi was part of a monster midfield combination with outside-centre Tevita Kuridrani, which revealed Cheika\u2019s intention to play a power game. For all the runs Kerevi made and for all the metres he gained, the Wallabies\u2019 plan of attack was too one-dimensional, too predictable. After only one Test and with just four more to play before the World Cup in Japan kicks off in September, the Wallabies will have to re-think their attacking strategy to create more variety in their play. They desperately need a second playmaker to take the pressure off five-eighth Bernard Foley, who was targeted by the Springboks\u2019 rush defence. Foley looked uncomfortable trying to execute the Wallabies\u2019 new flat-line attack under immense defensive pressure and Australia wasted possessional and territorial dominance in the first-half to trail 14-10 at the break. Cheika and his co-selectors Scott Johnson and Michael O\u2019Connor could choose a second five-eighth, as they say in New Zealand, such as Kurtley Beale, Matt Toomua or James O\u2019Connor at inside-centre and shift Kerevi to outside-centre. But if the selectors are committed to the powerful Kerevi-Kuridrani centre combination, they could start Beale at fullback and he could pop up at first or second receiver in phase play to ease the burden on Foley. Tom Banks, who started at fullback against the Springboks, is an exciting ball-runner, but he is not a playmaker.

Surely, there has to be a place for Beale somewhere in the starting line-up. In the end the Springboks won the big moments in the game and made fewer crucial mistakes. It will not matter what kind of strategy the Wallabies employ if they continue to make silly, unforced errors, which have undermined their game for the last four years. In the 17th minute Kerevi made a huge break out of the Wallabies\u2019 22 and charged up-field. He had blindside flanker Lukhan Salakaia-Loto in support, but delayed the offload a fraction of a second and the ball travelled forward, try disallowed. Winger Dane Haylett-Petty bombed a try in the 33rd minute when he fumbled the ball over the line after chasing a grubber kick by Foley. All Haylett-Petty had to do was dive on it. Haylett-Petty made another crucial error in the 61st minute which led to Springboks halfback and man of the match Herschel Jantjies scoring the second of his two tries. For some inexplicable reason Haylett-Petty joined a ruck 10 metres from the Wallabies\u2019 tryline, which left the blindside undefended. That was exactly where Jantjies scooted, hardly believing his luck. And, of course, there was the turning point moment when replacement tight-head prop Taniela Tupou was sin-binned in the 53rd minute for a dangerous clean-out on Springbok back-rower Rynhardt Elstadt. Wallabies captain Michael Hooper asked referee Paul Williams why Tupou\u2019s clean-out was dangerous. Williams replied: \u201cThe guy\u2019s sitting there, I\u2019ve blown the whistle and he\u2019s come running in with a shoulder.\u201d What more do you want to know? The Springboks scored two tries while Tupou was in the sin-bin. By the time the Wallabies had 15 men on the field again the score-line had blown out to 28-10. Game over. There are other issues the Wallabies will need to address if they are to have any chance of doing well not just in The Rugby Championship, but more importantly, the World Cup. While the lineout worked well, the scrum struggled badly, a real Achilles heel. That needs to be fixed. The more things change the more they stay the same for the Wallabies, and that is their biggest concern heading into their next Test against Argentina, who just fell short against the All Blacks in Buenos Aires yesterday, in Brisbane on Saturday night.",

      "body": "<p> A few weeks ago in western Sydney, I fanged around the Eastern Creek racetrack looking to kick the wheels of the electric car revolution.</p> \n<p>A lot has been written on the viability of the electric car: the price, the availability, the range, the chargers. But this was solely about the driving experience, from the perspective of someone who has only ever driven petrol cars.</p> \n<p>I tested six cars \u2013 from pure electric, to hydrogen fuel-cell, to petrol-hybrids. From the Tesla X SUV, to the fully electric SEA truck, to the one-person, three-wheel Toyota iRoad (which we will never speak of again).</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/23/should-i-buy-an-electric-car-all-you-need-to-know-about-prices-technology-and-range\">Should I buy an electric car? All you need to know about prices, technology and range</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>As a driver, the first thing you notice is that there is no gearbox. Electric cars simply don\u2019t have them. You shift from park to drive to reverse by pressing a button. And when driving, most models use a fixed-ratio gear. There is no clutch, no gearstick, no transmission.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s a bit disconcerting for someone used to the physical feedback of driving, and the muscle memory. In the hydrogen Hyundai Nexo, the gears are next to the air conditioning. There\u2019s nothing to physically pull or shift. No clunk to give you certainty. On the Tesla X, the gears are located on a stick on the wheel.</p> \n<p>The fixed gear and fewer moving parts also means an EV reaches its maximum torque more quickly than a petrol car, making it feel more sensitive to acceleration. It just takes off.</p> \n<p>It all feels unnervingly easy.</p> \n<p>Parking an electric SUV, all I needed to do was stop and click a small button. I leave the handbrake, I\u2019m told, to turn on automatically.</p> \n<p>Stepping out, I half-expected the $100,000 Tesla to immediately roll backwards and crush the other $100,000 Tesla. Thankfully, it didn\u2019t.</p> \n<p>In a way, this sums up my overall experience with electric cars. They take some getting used to, but it\u2019s an exciting feeling of grappling with something new and different. </p> \n<p>Of course, it\u2019s important to separate the elements that are due to their being electric from the standard excitement of the new. Any fancy feature or button from a 2019 car \u2013 for which you will pay at least $50,000 \u2013 is a massive step up from the 1998 Corolla I was driving until last year.</p> \n<p>But in many ways it\u2019s a combination \u2013 the niftiness of the bells and whistles is enabled by the futurism of the electric zero-emissions engine.</p> \n<p>On the Telsa X, for example, you can adjust your level of suspension on a touchscreen, with toggle buttons, as if your car was a giant iPad.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s almost a cliche now to say it, but the other thing you notice is that electric cars are silent.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/17/australia-urged-to-move-away-from-oil-dependency-or-risk-fuel-supply-crisis\">Australia urged to move away from oil dependency or risk fuel supply crisis</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>For me, it sank in on the drive home. It\u2019s not the lack of start-up rev that hits you, it\u2019s the silence when you are up and running. And it\u2019s really more impressive for the buses and trucks. It\u2019s something to see the SEA electric truck, loaded up on a delivery, leave the kerb silently and whisper around.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s something you appreciate from the outside, something that would cut down the noise of a busy road for everyone.</p> \n<p>The third and final difference, from the driver\u2019s seat, is the braking.</p> \n<p>Most models I tested have something called regenerative braking. This uses the kinetic energy of braking to recharge the car\u2019s battery as you drive.</p> \n<p>In short, it makes braking more severe, and a bit of a stop-start affair until you get used to it.</p> \n<p>The amount of regenerative braking varied from car to car, and can be turned off, but it was always initially on by default \u2013 presumably as an energy saving measure.</p> \n<p>On some models, the most extreme setting was the default. Lifting your foot off the accelerator was the equivalent of tapping the brakes in a petrol car \u2013 intentionally so. Some cars can work as a one-pedal drive.</p> \n<p>One spokesman told me he drove to work without hitting the brakes once, just using the highest setting of his regenerative brakes.</p> \n<p>So what\u2019s the take-home message?</p> \n<p>Electric cars do not feel radically different. They accelerate quicker, they have more torque and they slow down more sharply \u2013 but that\u2019s all down to your settings. It\u2019s about as shocking as borrowing a friend\u2019s car and getting used to it.</p> \n<p>They exude a feeling of future-proofing. No gears to crunch and fewer moving parts will make them last longer. And it\u2019s satisfying to think of a world where everyone owns one, no one spreads noise pollution down the street and no one emits carbon dioxide.</p> \n<p>But for many, it is a waiting game until the prices fall, and perhaps even until a secondhand market develops. They are becoming cheaper every day. Predictions are optimistic. Until then, it\u2019ll be limited to a few laps.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A few weeks ago in western Sydney, I fanged around the Eastern Creek racetrack looking to kick the wheels of the electric car revolution. A lot has been written on the viability of the electric car: the price, the availability, the range, the chargers. But this was solely about the driving experience, from the perspective of someone who has only ever driven petrol cars. I tested six cars \u2013 from pure electric, to hydrogen fuel-cell, to petrol-hybrids. From the Tesla X SUV, to the fully electric SEA truck, to the one-person, three-wheel Toyota iRoad (which we will never speak of again). As a driver, the first thing you notice is that there is no gearbox. Electric cars simply don\u2019t have them. You shift from park to drive to reverse by pressing a button. And when driving, most models use a fixed-ratio gear. There is no clutch, no gearstick, no transmission. It\u2019s a bit disconcerting for someone used to the physical feedback of driving, and the muscle memory. In the hydrogen Hyundai Nexo, the gears are next to the air conditioning. There\u2019s nothing to physically pull or shift. No clunk to give you certainty. On the Tesla X, the gears are located on a stick on the wheel. The fixed gear and fewer moving parts also means an EV reaches its maximum torque more quickly than a petrol car, making it feel more sensitive to acceleration. It just takes off. It all feels unnervingly easy. Parking an electric SUV, all I needed to do was stop and click a small button. I leave the handbrake, I\u2019m told, to turn on automatically. Stepping out, I half-expected the $100,000 Tesla to immediately roll backwards and crush the other $100,000 Tesla. Thankfully, it didn\u2019t. In a way, this sums up my overall experience with electric cars. They take some getting used to, but it\u2019s an exciting feeling of grappling with something new and different. Of course, it\u2019s important to separate the elements that are due to their being electric from the standard excitement of the new. Any fancy feature or button from a 2019 car \u2013 for which you will pay at least $50,000 \u2013 is a massive step up from the 1998 Corolla I was driving until last year. But in many ways it\u2019s a combination \u2013 the niftiness of the bells and whistles is enabled by the futurism of the electric zero-emissions engine. On the Telsa X, for example, you can adjust your level of suspension on a touchscreen, with toggle buttons, as if your car was a giant iPad. It\u2019s almost a cliche now to say it, but the other thing you notice is that electric cars are silent. For me, it sank in on the drive home. It\u2019s not the lack of start-up rev that hits you, it\u2019s the silence when you are up and running. And it\u2019s really more impressive for the buses and trucks. It\u2019s something to see the SEA electric truck, loaded up on a delivery, leave the kerb silently and whisper around. It\u2019s something you appreciate from the outside, something that would cut down the noise of a busy road for everyone. The third and final difference, from the driver\u2019s seat, is the braking. Most models I tested have something called regenerative braking. This uses the kinetic energy of braking to recharge the car\u2019s battery as you drive. In short, it makes braking more severe, and a bit of a stop-start affair until you get used to it. The amount of regenerative braking varied from car to car, and can be turned off, but it was always initially on by default \u2013 presumably as an energy saving measure. On some models, the most extreme setting was the default. Lifting your foot off the accelerator was the equivalent of tapping the brakes in a petrol car \u2013 intentionally so. Some cars can work as a one-pedal drive. One spokesman told me he drove to work without hitting the brakes once, just using the highest setting of his regenerative brakes. So what\u2019s the take-home message? Electric cars do not feel radically different. They accelerate quicker, they have more torque and they slow down more sharply \u2013 but that\u2019s all down to your settings. It\u2019s about as shocking as borrowing a friend\u2019s car and getting used to it. They exude a feeling of future-proofing. No gears to crunch and fewer moving parts will make them last longer. And it\u2019s satisfying to think of a world where everyone owns one, no one spreads noise pollution down the street and no one emits carbon dioxide. But for many, it is a waiting game until the prices fall, and perhaps even until a secondhand market develops. They are becoming cheaper every day. Predictions are optimistic. Until then, it\u2019ll be limited to a few laps.",

They lie there, you know, and for 40-odd years they might never have sex. It just seems a bit unfair.\u201d</p> <p>Wilde was trained by Touching Base, a long-standing referral service that connects sex workers and people with disabilities.</p> <p>Along with the <a href=\"https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/call-to-include-sex-work-in-ndis/news-story/ebee57f90bc3755f24e57c7f1d5bc639\">Canberra couple David and Jenni Heckendorf</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.scarletroad.com.au/about/\">successful documentary, Scarlet Road</a>, Touching Base has helped counter the misconception that people with disabilities do not have sexual desires.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOpC0tYp_Qg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mOpC0tYp_Qg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>When the star of Scarlet Road, Rachel Wotton, <a href=\"https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au//bitstream/2123/16875/1/Wotton_RW_thesis.pdf\">conducted a survey for a research paper</a> asking about 70 New South Wales-based sex workers if they\u2019d ever seen a client with a disability, she found 90% had. The same proportion had seen the client more than once. And asked how often their disabled clients would return, most said the main factor was whether the person could afford it.</p> <p>Among her clients with disabilities, Wilde says there\u2019s \u201cquite a broad spectrum\u201d. She sees those with intellectual impairments, such as Asperger\u2019s, as well as people who have cerebral palsy or acquired injuries.</p> <p><em>\u201c</em>I have a thorough understanding of what the client would like me to do and not do,\u201d she says. \u201cThe other thing to be aware of is that usually, the client \u2026 they\u2019re handled a lot. They have carers that genuinely care for them, but it\u2019s very mechanical. Sometimes they miss being handled in a more loving, intimate way.\u201d</p> <p>The Sydney sex worker Saul Isbister started Touching Base in 2000 after he noticed a growing demand from people with disabilities. Most of the time, the referrals come from support staff or family members, in part because of the nature of the person\u2019s disability.</p> <p>\u201cThere are others who directly approach us as clients themselves,\u201d Isbister says. \u201cFor some people, all they want is a sex worker who won\u2019t discriminate against them \u2026 Others are looking for someone who has already had some experience working with someone with a disability so that the client doesn\u2019t have to train the worker during the session.</p> <p>\u201cWhen it comes to the actual session, I always like to be clear on how consent will be determined. For some people who are non-verbal, that might require setting up a means of acknowledging how yes and no are going to be expressed, before we even get to the bedroom.\u201d</p> <p>McReynolds now organises her sessions by herself. \u201cI make a booking directly with the escort and to see if they are available around the time that I want to see them,\u201d says McReynolds.</p> <p>She asks for the \u201cfull service\u201d and sees the same sex worker each time. Having some sessions funded by the NDIS would make a big difference to her life. \u201c[It] causes us to get frustrated because we can\u2019t release ourselves,\u201d she says. \u201c\u2026 everybody else we know is having sex.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Community expectations\u2019</h2> <p>Jordon Steele-John, a Greens senator who lives with cerebral palsy, accuses the government of adopting a \u201cbroad, nebulous ideas of community expectations\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt is nobody else\u2019s business,\u201d he says. \u201cIf a disabled person wants to put an aspect of sexual expression into their plan, that they need the services of a sex worker to achieve that, and that is approved by the administrative processes of the NDIS, then that is it.\u201d</p> <p>He also argues that the \u201cdesexualisation of disabled people is a key factor in a lot of the abuse situations we end up in\u201d. \u201cWe are not given access to information or support because it isn\u2019t believed that we are sexual beings,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Robert, who declined to comment, was categorical last week, saying: \u201cThe current position continues to be that the NDIS does not cover sexual services, sexual therapy or sex workers in a participant\u2019s NDIS plan.</p> <p>\u201cThese services are not in line with community expectations of what are reasonable and necessary supports.\u201d</p> <p>The agency won\u2019t be drawn on the question of community expectations. \u201cThis was a decision taken by the NDIA, as is appropriate,\u201d a spokeswoman says.</p> <p>\u201cIt is important to note the specific question in the case was whether the requested support (funding for a sex worker) was reasonable and necessary, which is the test under the Act. Applying the criteria in the Act, the agency found that sex worker support was not reasonable and necessary.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis continues to be the current position under the NDIS.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15e094a7e2a5e8ef7599eb87f3c9857b24058694\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15e094a7e2a5e8ef7599eb87f3c9857b24058694/0_186_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jordon Steele-John says it\u2019s nobody else\u2019s business if a disabled person wants to put an aspect of sexual expression into their NDIS plan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jordon Steele-John says it\u2019s nobody else\u2019s business if a disabled person wants to put an aspect of sexual expression into their NDIS plan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2005, laws came into effect in Denmark <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/denmark/1499735/Taxpayers-foot-bill-for-disabled-Danes-visits-to-prostitutes.html\">allowing people with disabilities to charge the taxpayer to visit a sex worker once a month</a>. A similar system now operates in the Netherlands.</p> <p>In Germany, the idea was floated in 2013, and then again in 2017. <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/germany-sexual-assistance-prostitution-disabled-people-greens-scharfenberg-a7519721.html\">One disability advocate, Matthias Vernaldi, was concerned</a> it would \u201cstrengthen public perception of disabled people being some type of imperfect creatures and just expand again the once believed, conquered therapisation of the intimate spheres of disabled people\u201d.</p> <p>Wilde supports NDIS funding for the sexual services, but she acknowledges why there might be some concerns. \u201c[Costs] can be quite varied,\u201d she says. \u201cI charge $330 for the hour.

In response to a Daily Telegraph story that made reference to \u201cunconventional\u201d supports offered by the scheme, but made no mention of sexual services, the NDIA issued a statement saying it did not fund <a href=\"https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/ndis-funding-prostitution-providers-banned-from-applying/news-story/44d4c1c00430d42659ceca27d8dcf087\">\u201csexual services, sexual therapy or sex workers in a participant\u2019s NDIS plan\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Where before there was no policy, now there was a blanket ban.</p> <p>Bowden and Isbister both claim the disability community has quietly been able to use taxpayers\u2019 money to visit a sex worker for quite a while.</p> <p>They claim people had used state disability funding to pay for the services and, despite the NDIS\u2019s claims, the money had actually been carried over from state plans in the early days of the new scheme.</p> <p>\u201cWe could appreciate that the agency and those individuals were going about that in a quiet way,\u201d Bowden says. \u201cMost people aren\u2019t wanting the supports they might require to have sex or reach orgasm made very public.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The community does not expect people with disability to live the life of a nun</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Eventually, Bowden says the agency began rejecting claims when people tried to update their plans to include sex work services.

      "bodyText": "Ange McReynolds was 32 when she first asked one of her friends to \u201ccall up to ask for an escort\u201d. McReynolds, who has severe cerebral palsy, represented Australia at the 2000 Paralympics in the sport of boccia, which is similar to bocce. Still, in her words, she relies on others to do everything for her. The same goes for sex. \u201cI access the service once a month,\u201d McReynolds tells Guardian Australia. \u201cIt costs me $280 for two hours.\u201d Now 39, McReynolds says that, if she could, she would go more often. Every second week would be her preference. \u201cI would like to see the NDIS fund it, because some of us can\u2019t afford to see a sex worker,\u201d she says in an email interview. The minister responsible for the national disability insurance scheme, Stuart Robert, thinks he knows what the public might think about that. Last week, Robert declared that the idea the scheme might fund sexual services did not meet \u201ccommunity expectations\u201d. Robert was forced to wade into the issue after a woman in her 40s with multiple sclerosis won the right to have sexual therapy funding in her NDIS plan. The story was a tabloid\u2019s dream: a woman seeking \u201csexual release\u201d paid for by the taxpayer. In the end, reporting of the tribunal decision was quite restrained, but if advocates were relieved, it was short-lived. Soon after the news broke, Robert said the agency would appeal to the federal court, a rare move that increases the likelihood of a precedent-setting decision. If there was any consolation for advocates, it\u2019s that the tribunal had approved funding for sexual therapy, which is generally not \u201chands on\u201d, but did not rule on sex worker services. Much to the confusion of advocates and the agency, this was what the applicant had actually sought. The appeal means the federal court may yet rule that the insurance scheme must fund sexual services for people with disabilities \u2013 a huge public win for the disability community after years of uncertainty. \u2018It just seems a bit unfair\u2019 Replacing the disjointed state-by-state system, the NDIS now provides funding packages to cover \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d support for more than 300,000 Australians. More than 100,000 of these people are receiving support for the first time. But the definition of what is \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d has been the subject of dispute, amid arguments between the states and the commonwealth, and between the agency and disability advocates. There is no data on how many people might want to access sexual services through the NDIS \u2013 but advocates claim that some people had already done so previously and the agency had simply turned a blind eye. It later had a public change of heart, according to disability groups, and in the recent Administrative Appeals Tribunal case, the agency warned that offering sexual services presented a financial risk to the scheme\u2019s future. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Matthew Bowden, the co-chief executive of People With Disability Australia, disagrees. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a minority, niche request,\u201d he tells Guardian Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s not that every person with MS or every single person with a physical disability or intellectual disability or any impairment \u2026 is going to want to include access to sex workers in their package.\u201d The sex worker Scarlett B Wilde acknowledges she has a good reason for wanting the NDIS to pay for people to see her. \u201cI put my hand up, I have a vested interest within my business,\u201d she tells Guardian Australia. \u201cBut at the same time, it\u2019s the client that misses out. They lie there, you know, and for 40-odd years they might never have sex. It just seems a bit unfair.\u201d Wilde was trained by Touching Base, a long-standing referral service that connects sex workers and people with disabilities. Along with the Canberra couple David and Jenni Heckendorf, and the successful documentary, Scarlet Road, Touching Base has helped counter the misconception that people with disabilities do not have sexual desires. When the star of Scarlet Road, Rachel Wotton, conducted a survey for a research paper asking about 70 New South Wales-based sex workers if they\u2019d ever seen a client with a disability, she found 90% had. The same proportion had seen the client more than once. And asked how often their disabled clients would return, most said the main factor was whether the person could afford it. Among her clients with disabilities, Wilde says there\u2019s \u201cquite a broad spectrum\u201d. She sees those with intellectual impairments, such as Asperger\u2019s, as well as people who have cerebral palsy or acquired injuries. \u201cI have a thorough understanding of what the client would like me to do and not do,\u201d she says. \u201cThe other thing to be aware of is that usually, the client \u2026 they\u2019re handled a lot. They have carers that genuinely care for them, but it\u2019s very mechanical. Sometimes they miss being handled in a more loving, intimate way.\u201d The Sydney sex worker Saul Isbister started Touching Base in 2000 after he noticed a growing demand from people with disabilities. Most of the time, the referrals come from support staff or family members, in part because of the nature of the person\u2019s disability. \u201cThere are others who directly approach us as clients themselves,\u201d Isbister says. \u201cFor some people, all they want is a sex worker who won\u2019t discriminate against them \u2026 Others are looking for someone who has already had some experience working with someone with a disability so that the client doesn\u2019t have to train the worker during the session. \u201cWhen it comes to the actual session, I always like to be clear on how consent will be determined. For some people who are non-verbal, that might require setting up a means of acknowledging how yes and no are going to be expressed, before we even get to the bedroom.\u201d McReynolds now organises her sessions by herself. \u201cI make a booking directly with the escort and to see if they are available around the time that I want to see them,\u201d says McReynolds. She asks for the \u201cfull service\u201d and sees the same sex worker each time. Having some sessions funded by the NDIS would make a big difference to her life. \u201c[It] causes us to get frustrated because we can\u2019t release ourselves,\u201d she says. \u201c\u2026 everybody else we know is having sex.\u201d \u2018Community expectations\u2019 Jordon Steele-John, a Greens senator who lives with cerebral palsy, accuses the government of adopting a \u201cbroad, nebulous ideas of community expectations\u201d. \u201cIt is nobody else\u2019s business,\u201d he says. \u201cIf a disabled person wants to put an aspect of sexual expression into their plan, that they need the services of a sex worker to achieve that, and that is approved by the administrative processes of the NDIS, then that is it.\u201d He also argues that the \u201cdesexualisation of disabled people is a key factor in a lot of the abuse situations we end up in\u201d. \u201cWe are not given access to information or support because it isn\u2019t believed that we are sexual beings,\u201d he says. Robert, who declined to comment, was categorical last week, saying: \u201cThe current position continues to be that the NDIS does not cover sexual services, sexual therapy or sex workers in a participant\u2019s NDIS plan. \u201cThese services are not in line with community expectations of what are reasonable and necessary supports.\u201d The agency won\u2019t be drawn on the question of community expectations. \u201cThis was a decision taken by the NDIA, as is appropriate,\u201d a spokeswoman says. \u201cIt is important to note the specific question in the case was whether the requested support (funding for a sex worker) was reasonable and necessary, which is the test under the Act. Applying the criteria in the Act, the agency found that sex worker support was not reasonable and necessary.\u201d \u201cThis continues to be the current position under the NDIS.\u201d In 2005, laws came into effect in Denmark allowing people with disabilities to charge the taxpayer to visit a sex worker once a month. A similar system now operates in the Netherlands. In Germany, the idea was floated in 2013, and then again in 2017. One disability advocate, Matthias Vernaldi, was concerned it would \u201cstrengthen public perception of disabled people being some type of imperfect creatures and just expand again the once believed, conquered therapisation of the intimate spheres of disabled people\u201d. Wilde supports NDIS funding for the sexual services, but she acknowledges why there might be some concerns. \u201c[Costs] can be quite varied,\u201d she says. \u201cI charge $330 for the hour. But you\u2019ve got some bills that go six, seven hundred dollars \u2026 whenever it\u2019s government funding \u2026 I guess there\u2019s an element of that.\u201d The the disabilities minister Mitch Fifield was asked whether the NDIS would fund sexual services in its early days in 2013, but he declined to \u201cgive an on-the-spot ruling\u201d. Things changed publicly in 2017. In response to a Daily Telegraph story that made reference to \u201cunconventional\u201d supports offered by the scheme, but made no mention of sexual services, the NDIA issued a statement saying it did not fund \u201csexual services, sexual therapy or sex workers in a participant\u2019s NDIS plan\u201d. Where before there was no policy, now there was a blanket ban. Bowden and Isbister both claim the disability community has quietly been able to use taxpayers\u2019 money to visit a sex worker for quite a while. They claim people had used state disability funding to pay for the services and, despite the NDIS\u2019s claims, the money had actually been carried over from state plans in the early days of the new scheme. \u201cWe could appreciate that the agency and those individuals were going about that in a quiet way,\u201d Bowden says. \u201cMost people aren\u2019t wanting the supports they might require to have sex or reach orgasm made very public.\u201d Eventually, Bowden says the agency began rejecting claims when people tried to update their plans to include sex work services. Those who were self-managing their plans were also told they could no longer access the services. \u201cI think some of the more conservative members of the ministry and of the agency still are very hung up,\u201d Isbister says. \u201cI think the NDIA are way out of step with community expectations. The community does not expect people with disability to live the life of a nun.\u201d He says in motor accident insurance cases, courts have included access to sex worker services in settlements. Bowden adds: \u201cIf you are unable to reach your own genitals because of the type of disability or impairment you have, then I think the community would expect a person would have some assistance to have sexual release. \u201cWhether it\u2019s to be positioned to have sex with their husband or wife or partner \u2026 these services are only provided by sex workers, they are not provided by sex therapists or anyone else.\u201d McReynolds is also confident they can win the fight. \u201cThe community feels the same as me,\u201d she says. And to the critics, she adds: \u201cThey don\u2019t really know what it is like having a disability [and not] having sex.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s hoped-for triumphant march into Downing Street this week is set to be dampened by a carefully timed series of resignations by senior ministers, who will retreat to the backbenches with a vow to thwart any moves towards a no-deal Brexit. The announcements by Philip Hammond and David Gauke that they will step down on Wednesday, immediately before Johnson is likely to head to Buckingham Palace, highlight the perilous political climate for Theresa May\u2019s expected successor. It comes amid predictions that the Conservatives\u2019 already wafer-thin working Commons majority of three could entirely disappear by the time MPs return from their summer recess, with mooted defections to the Lib Dems coming on top of a predicted byelection defeat. Barring a hugely unexpected twist, Johnson is expected to be announced on Tuesday as the victor over Jeremy Hunt in the vote of Conservative members, formally taking over the next day, after May holds a valedictory prime minister\u2019s questions. However, some of the gloss will be removed with the promised resignations of Hammond, the chancellor, and Gauke, the justice secretary, with predictions that other ministers and junior ministers opposed to no deal, such as the international development secretary, Rory Stewart, could follow. It is understood that the business secretary, Greg Clark, another key cabinet voice against no deal, has no plans to resign. Hammond took some apparent glee in announcing his intention live on BBC One\u2019s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday. Asked if he expected to be sacked if Johnson took power, he replied: \u201cNo, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not going to be sacked, because I\u2019m going to resign before we get to that point.\u201d He added: \u201cI understand that his conditions for serving in his government would include accepting a no-deal exit on 31 October, and that\u2019s not something that I could ever sign up to.\u201d Hammond denied that he would be recast on the backbenches as a serial rebel, insisting his only aim would be to stop a Johnson government forcing through no-deal without the explicit consent of MPs, for example by proroguing parliament. \u201cThis is a parliamentary democracy, and if the new prime minister can persuade parliament to vote for a no-deal exit, then I will have to accept that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t have wheezes like suspending parliament or proroguing parliament in order to deny parliament its voice.\u201d Earlier, Gauke said he also could not serve under Johnson. \u201cGiven that I\u2019ve been in the cabinet since Theresa May came to power, I think the appropriate thing is for me to resign,\u201d he told the Sunday Times, saying he would depart on Wednesday. He added: \u201cIf the test of loyalty to stay in the cabinet is a commitment to support no deal on 31 October \u2013 which, to be fair to him, Boris has consistently said \u2013 then that\u2019s not something I\u2019m prepared to sign up to.\u201d Both Hammond and Gauke, along with Clark and Stewart, were among ministers who defied government whips last week over a backbench motion that makes it harder for Johnson to suspend parliament.

However, by the time MPs return at the start of September, Johnson\u2019s difficulties could have multiplied, with the Lib Dems tipped to take the Brecon and Radnorshire seat from the Tories in an early August byelection. While senior Lib Dem sources have played down reports that up to six disgruntled remain-minded Conservatives could defect to the party, they say enough are considering the move to potentially remove the rest of Johnson\u2019s working majority. \u201cAt the moment we don\u2019t know how many we\u2019ll get over the line,\u201d a source said. \u201cA lot depends on Johnson\u2019s first 48 hours in No 10.

      "bodyText": "There can be no better illustration of the disconnect between the people and the Tory leadership than its wilful ignorance of the sheer scale of the growing countrywide opposition to its mindless stampede towards a no-deal Brexit. A poll by Hope Not Hate released on Monday will show that, by a margin of two to one, British people think that the economy, their families\u2019 economic prospects, inward investment into the UK and even their exposure to terrorism will take a turn for the worse if we crash out of the European Union on 31 October. Only 17% of women think no deal would be good for Britain. They are right to be worried: the no-deal Brexit we are now being offered is not the Brexit promised before and during the referendum. \u201cWhat most people in this country want is the single market, the common market\u201d, Boris Johnson is on record as saying, along with \u201cPersonally, I would like to stay in the single market\u201d. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be terrible if we were really like Norway and Switzerland? Really?\u201d said Nigel Farage. \u201cThey\u2019re rich. They\u2019re happy. They\u2019re self-governing.\u201d Yet if no deal goes ahead on Thursday 31 October, it will be nothing like Norway or Switzerland. By the following day \u2013 what Brexiteers will call \u201cFreedom Friday\u201d- there will be long queues at Dover and by Saturday 2 November many of our motorways will be at a standstill. By that Sunday, food prices will be going up \u2013 a 10% rise is the latest estimate \u2013 and by Monday the pound will be sharply down on its pre-Brexit value. By Tuesday medical drugs from mainland Europe will be less accessible, and a week after Brexit, companies will be complaining that vital stocks and components are not reaching them, bringing the threat of having to put workers on short time, and economists who have long forecasted recession will not be surprised. All of the above is not a \u201cproject fear\u201d fantasy, but the most conservative conclusions of an assessment by the UK\u2019s most senior civil servant, which was leaked in April. These conclusions have been backed up by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, a Commons committee report and countless others.

We\u2019ve had a hard battle over the last four days but we couldn\u2019t force a result. We came here today hoping to be in a position to enforce a follow-on as we thought that was the best way to win the game, so when that went and we lost those two early wickets, that put a dampner on things.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a lot closer than what the scoreboard suggests.

But takes her out the very next ball with a cross-seamer going in flat at the stumps, a bit fast and a bit too low as Sciver tried to dab it through backward point, and it takes the underside of Sciver\u2019s glove back onto the stumps.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf9de71311bbb0fb891c319d3f037fd3873d9c64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf9de71311bbb0fb891c319d3f037fd3873d9c64/0_0_3500_2335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Natalie Sciver of England, dejected as he walks back to the pavilion after being dismissed for 88.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Natalie Sciver of England, dejected as he walks back to the pavilion after being dismissed for 88.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Hunt/ProSports/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-21T11:52:52.839Z\">at 12.52pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d34481b8f08cf92bb77410e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-21T11:13:17.107Z\">12.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>101st over: England 250-7 (Sciver 87, Marsh 13) </strong>Tayla Vlaeminck bowls a bit too full, and Sciver whips off the pads, nicely timed and it will beat long leg for four! Going square of the wicket with that shot. Loses her line down leg a couple of times, allowing Sciver to get another single. A short leg comes in for Marsh, rather than the leg gully from last over, but Marsh backs away a fraction to give room to angle the ball at her body into the gap at cover and get two runs.

So that ball was pitching on off stump, very much live for an lbw. But angling down leg, and Marsh must have been very confident or very daring. Padded up, and there was no appeal.

A sweet, luscious boundary. Get the juices of life coursing through ya. Perry gives a bit of width, and Shrubsole plays a species of cover drive, performed with the motion of a short-arm jab: going staccato at the ball and jarring to a stop at the point of impact, but striking it well enough to split point and cover for four. Shrubsole tries again a couple of balls later, wider and with a lot of bottom hand as she reaches for the ball, but hits it too square to point. Edges the fourth ball, but with soft enough hands along the ground to second slip. Ash Gardner is at gully. Last ball of the over, Shrubsole takes on the short ball!

What can today bring? In terms of an interesting result, with 108 overs in the day, there are two possible options. One is that England smash another 72 runs in say 15 overs, leaving Australia maybe 30 overs to pile on some runs of their own, then declare to set England a vaguely plausible target. That\u2019s if both sides are willing to take a punt on getting a decent finish and a chance at a result.</p> <p>The second option is that Australia take four wickets in a hurry and make England bat again, meaning there\u2019s a proper survival innings to play for the rest of the day.<br>But the more likely option judging by their play last night is that England won\u2019t try to do either of these things, and we\u2019ll play for a pointless draw. The only points of interest there will be whether any of the bowlers or batters can reach some sort of milestone for their own personal satisfaction, starting with Sciver\u2019s chance at a century and Molineux having a shot at five wickets.<br>Ultimately there is no refuge in a draw for England, because drawing still guarantees they can\u2019t win back the Ashes in this series \u2013 it would leave them trailing 8 points to 2, with 6 possible points in the T20s and Australia retaining the trophy. So they shouldn\u2019t be trying to play out a draw, and they shouldn\u2019t be imagining that saving the match will mean anything. But based on their work last night, I have a sneaking feeling they will do that and think that anyway. Prove me wrong, go on.<br></p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "So the Ashes return to Australia - with the T20s still to play. England can yet draw the series, so they mustn\u2019t go empty-hearted into the final fight. Perry is the obvious divide between the two sides. World class with bat and ball and blessed with an absolute patience. Will she be disappointed that Lanning didn\u2019t let her bat on to her second hundred of the match? I don\u2019t think so - she must have known that handshakes were on the cards. And the fun, my friends, is in the accumulation. Some exciting young talents on display: Gardner and Molineux in particular in this match and Tayla Vlaeminck on another day on a different pitch. Heather Knight: \u201cI\u2019m disappointed. Congratulations to them but now we\u2019ve got a T20 series to show what we can do, because we haven\u2019t played up to the standards we know we can do.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of character and resilience in our team, unfortunately the game was gone and it was too much to ask for today but we have to look forward.\u201d Meg Lanning. Hands on hips, big smile. \u201cIt is certainly a good position to be in. We\u2019ve had a hard battle over the last four days but we couldn\u2019t force a result. We came here today hoping to be in a position to enforce a follow-on as we thought that was the best way to win the game, so when that went and we lost those two early wickets, that put a dampner on things.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been a lot closer than what the scoreboard suggests. Ellyse is able to bat for long periods of time, she loves playing Test cricket. And the player of the match? EP! \u201cThe last four days have been incredibly good fun.\u201d she deadpans with a smile. What a player. That\u2019s it from us for today. Do join us again for the T20 series. Thanks for all the emails and messages - have a lovely evening. Good night! Meg Lanning gives the signal from the boundary, and that is that! Australia have batted out the afternoon and evening and not given England a sniff. Which is entirely within their baggy green remit. A draw between the two teams - ssometomething which was on the cards from day two when the rain curtailed much of the play. Gardner has a gleeful whallop off Knight and is caught at deep midwicket. 63rd over: Australia 227-6 ( Gardner 6, Perry 74) And there is the champagne moment of the match! Gardner launches into her second ball and deposits Gordon straight down the ground and into the confectionary stand (if there was one.) Six big ones. Molineux is bowled off her pads by Gordon, prodding down the wrong line. A super innings by her - she was just starting to motor. What a smart little debut! 62ndover: Australia 215-5 ( Molineux 35 , Perry 74) I like the way Knight is bowling herself now, shows leadership. And I assume they must be about to shake hands? A win is a win is a win, but this Ashes urn will be secured more with a whimper than a bang. That said - this is an awesome side and the win is deserved. 61st over: Australia 207-5 ( Molineux 28 , Perry 73) Well, that was a nice shot! Molineux punch-cuts Gordon for four. Ten out of ten for crunchiness. 60th over: Australia 200-5 ( Molineux 23 , Perry 71) Um. Not much to say really. Knight bowling. One off it. 59th over: Australia 199-5 ( Molineux 23 , Perry 70) A couple from Gordon as the sun starts to set on this game. Perry has to get a wriggle on if she wants this century. 58th over: Australia 197-5 ( Molineux 22 , Perry 69) Some wisdom from Tat Wood in my email box: It seems to me that the apparently odd decisions of both captains are guided by the simple fact that everyone only really get this one chance to be a test cricketer. So I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll come off before they absolutely have to. Perry has a chance for a significant first - a third successive test century. I\u2019m old enough to remember Mike Deness as men\u2019s captain and the jokes about replacing him with Rachael Heyhoe (\u2018at least she wins occasionally\u2019). The women\u2019s game now has a degree of parity in support (mainly because the ECB seems hell-bent on making the men\u2019s game unappealing to kids) but if the paucity of test sides and available slots is making things like today happen the whole enterprise will stay marginal. The big winner here has been Taunton. If the scheduling had any logic to it, regional grounds would capitalise on women\u2019s cricket as a way to stay afloat. 57th over: Australia 195-5 ( Molineux 21 , Perry 68) Molineux decides to make hay. She sends a Gordon full-toss over the boundary for four. And an even better shot next ball, through the covers and tantalisingly near the rope, but Elwiss finds the energy to stop it. Super fielding. Tuvic has a pun to share: Surely, Ellyse has sighted another Ashes century in her Perry-pheral vision here... 56th over: Australia 188-5 ( Molineux 15 , Perry 67) Knight doing a job for her team here - ah, until that full toss which Molineux sends away with a crack to the boundary. 55th over: Australia 183-5 ( Molineux 11 , Perry 67) 54th over: Australia 180-5 ( Molineux 9 , Perry 66) Just one from Knight\u2019s over as Molineux and Perry are determinedly and grittily boring. Grind them girls, grind them! 53rd over: Australia 179-5 ( Molineux 9 , Perry 65) Blah. A maiden from Gordon. A tweet has arrived from Africa. I love modern communication! - though I do think my kids, you kids, are missing something by never having to write on a wafer-thin blue paper in spider scrawl their deepest thoughts before posting it into the air mail sack. 52nd over: Australia 179-5 ( Molineux 9 , Perry 65) Fran Wilson\u2019s tired legs can\u2019t quite lift her high enough to catch a drive from Molineux at cover. She\u2019s on as sub for Sarah Taylor - still off with that shoulder injury. 51st over: Australia 178-5 ( Molineux 8 , Perry 65) If this match really is going nowhere, perhaps the teams will be shaking hands early? The captains can consult in half an hour. Four off Shrubsole\u2019s over, an easy glide to third man and beyond by Molineux. 50th over: Australia 172-5 ( Molineux 4 , Perry 65) What an over by the skipper: a leg bye, a wicket with a low roller and a full toss disappearing for four. And from nowhere! Knight brings herself on and sneaks through Jonassen with her third ball. 49th over: Australia 166-4 ( Jonassen 26 , Perry 64) Just a single from Shrubsole\u2019s over. Full marks to her for effort this late in the day. An email from Pauline, or Bruce. I\u2019m not sure. Anyway: This proves that it should be a 5 day test. The attitude, skill and performance from both teams have been worthy of a full five day contest. I cannot understand how sandpapergate crept into the commentary. It rubs people up the wrong way. They never forget. Perhaps it does go against the grain. (Sorry.) TBH I\u2019m over it. If as a crowd we forgive Ben Stokes for a full-bloodied fight, we should forgive for cheating. 48th over: Australia 165-4 ( Jonassen 26 , Perry 64) Jonassen powers a full-toss from Elswiss up and high and down to the rope. Another boundary follows. Not much pressure. Not much anything. Australia lead by 310 - come on, gives us a wee treat for the last hour... 47th over: Australia 156-4 ( Jonassen 26 , Perry 64) A cracking ball from Shrubsole finds the edge of Perry\u2019s bat, and Taylor can\u2019t get her paws to it. It rattles over for four more. Not sure if that is why, but Taylor runs off at the end of the over, and Jones pulls on the gloves. 46th over: Australia 151-4 ( Jonassen 25 , Perry 60) Jonassen has a mighty Sunday slog off Elwiss for four. 45th over: Australia 146-4 ( Jonassen 19 , Perry 60) Perry does some shadow batting at the non-striker\u2019s end. And then some real batting, prodding forwards and blocking Shrubsole with a drop-dead gorgeous defence. Perhaps a moment for the purists. Sarah Bacon is banging her keyboard with some fury. What the ... ?!!! We\u2019re STILL batting?! Ellyse Perry, famous for being a gal who has to be dragged kicking and screaming from doing batting practice in the nets, is not doing herself -- or Australia -- any favours here. And while knocking England out before close-of-play isn\u2019t guaranteed, a shot at it is surely warranted, isn\u2019t it? *Gnashes teeth* Yours in ... frustration, 44th over: Australia 145-4 ( Jonassen 19 , Perry 60) Elwiss dibble-dobbles on the tiddlewinks spot. OB Jato has dropped a line: I wouldn\u2019t have minded five days of this fun! However, there\u2019s no use crying over spilt milk, or spoiled schedules ... At least Perry has crossed 50 in her Test career, again! One hopes Australia declare ASAP, but we all know this will be a draw either ways. This was a spectacular contest with no definitive winner - most of Test cricket defined for you! Thanks OB. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d go as far as spectacular. More hard-fought? Determined? For me the captains \u201csettled\u201d a bit too much for it to be spectacular. Any thoughts? 43rd over: Australia 144-4 ( Jonassen 18 , Perry 60) A better over from Shrubsole. The last ball leaps from nowhere off the pitch and hits Taylor behind the stumps - who rolls over with the impact. It\u2019s hit somewhere near the left shoulder and she seems in quite a lot of pain - but she wriggles her fingers to the satisfaction of the physio and things seem to be ok. Katherine Brunt hasn\u2019t come out after tea with a sore shoulder after that dive at cover in the field. 42nd over: Australia 142-4 ( Jonassen 18 , Perry 59) Elwiss delivers five dots and a full toss which is treated with lofty distain and a big heave-ho by Jonassen through extra cover and over the rope. 41st over: Australia 138-4 ( Jonassen 14 , Perry 59) So no declaration and just 41 overs left of this Test. Will they declare? When will they declare? Kudos to England who still look very chirpy and have a big friendly huddle before the start. At last Shrubsole gets her mitts on the ball. The first delivery is short and wide and Perry cuts it for four. The over improves as Perry plays and misses and then treats the remaining balls with respect. Romeo writes: Afternoon Tanya, I\u2019m really quite disappointed Australia don\u2019t want to make a proper game of this. There are people watching at the ground, more than there have been on the damp days, and they could just declare now and say \u2018Have a go\u2019. It\u2019s a bit unfortunate they won\u2019t. For the sake of the game, and the reputation of women\u2019s cricket, I would love them to declare. But I can see why Lanning hasn\u2019t. She doesn\u2019t have to, she wins the Ashes with a draw, and crowd pleasing isn\u2019t in the Baggy Green handbook, even post sandpapergate. Here we got then - the last session of the Ashes Test 2019 and Australia are .... batting. 40th over: Australia 134-4 ( Jonassen 14 , Perry 55) Knight goes back to her winning hand - Laura Marsh, in what will probably be the last over before the tea break. Only one from it - but to be honest the ball is in Australia\u2019s court now. England just watch, and wait. And bowl. And that is tea. The players wander off. Australia lead by 279 and there are a minimum of 44 overs left in the day. A declaration would leave England chasing 280 off 41 overs - a run-rate of over six. Something to ponder over a cup of tea and whatever is hiding in the larder. 39th over: Australia 133-4 ( Jonassen 14 , Perry 54) Two off the over and we see the Australian balcony where arms are folded, in pockets or hidden. 38th over: Australia 131-4 ( Jonassen 13 , Perry 53) We tarry a while as the umpires replay a run-out call, a smart bit of work by the Ecclestone-Taylor combo, but Perry is just home. Then a slightly shorter ball from Brunt, and Perry leans back and dispatches a missive through backward point for another fifty! So in her last two Tests.... a double century, a century, and an unbeaten fifty. Not bad lass. Abhijato has a suggestion: \u201cGive them 280 to chase off 40 overs, Australia ... It might produce one of the greatest finishes in Test match history across genders, after all!\u201d You never know as Perry now has her fifty and it is nearly tea. What will Lanning do in the break? 37th over: Australia 125-4 ( Jonassen 13 , Perry 47) A dabble past third man and Jonassen sends Ecclestone for a boundary.. If Australia were to declare now, England would have to chase six an over. And hooray! An email arrives with a flourish into my inbox. Hello Tanya! Hello Avitaj! Steve Waugh would have probably declared in this situation, eh? Surely Australia must back their bowlers on this pitch.. (okay, I admit I just want a last hour finish). Oooh I don\u2019t know. Would he have applied enough mental disintegration? 36th over: Australia 120-4 ( Jonassen 9 , Perry 46) Brunt drifts a fraction wide and Jonassen drives through the covers, with a low back knee, and it skims along the grass and over the boundary. Then again, slightly less prettily, an edge through gully for another four. 35th over: Australia 112-4 ( Jonassen 1, Perry 46) Sophie Ecclestone does like a sleeveless sweater. The skies at Taunton are less cornflower blue than murky ink. Short sleeves for the batters, sunglasses for the umpires. Just two from the over as Jonassen gets off the mark. Ah, now we have Katherine Brunt. 34th over: Australia 110-4 ( Jonassen 0, Perry 45) Elwiss rattles through the balls, tick, tick, tick. Perry pulls her first ball for four, just another single from the over and the minutes and the overs and the day tock away. 33rd over: Australia 105-4 ( Jonnasen 0, Perry 40) Each time you see that catch, it looks a little better. A screamer! It was coming super hard too. Beaumont and Ecclestone are utterly thrilled. A super catch by Tammy Beaumont at short leg, as Mooney goes to have a huge slog, she gathers it in the folds of her jumper at belly height. And England dismiss the enforcer! 32nd over: Australia 103-3 ( Mooney 23, Perry 40) Just a couple off that Elwiss over. This is very true: 31st over: Australia 100-3 ( Mooney 23, Perry 37) Beautiful shot by Mooney off Ecclestone - a simply delicious drive for four through the covers. Add a leg bye and a single and it is six off the over. Perry is definitely struggling, lamely jogging a single where normally she\u2019s ease through - which of course will also be preying on Meg Lanning\u2019s mind. A non-bowling Perry confuses the equation. Do email me if you want to chat/moan/ponder on tanya.aldred.freelance@theguardian.com or tweet @tjaldred. 30th over: Australia 94-3 ( Mooney 18, Perry 37) Marsh gets a rest at last as Knight turns to Elwiss and whispers instructions in her ears. Elwiss scampers in briskly and Australia get just one from the over. We see Perry and the Australian coach bent over a pad of paper ..... 29th over: Australia 93-3 ( Mooney 18, Perry 36) A classy shot from Mooney outruns the fielders, through the covers and over the boundary. A little less class a little more arse later on, up and over slog-sweep for four through midwicket. Just watching some analysis on SKY which shows that Perry is struggling with her back leg. As she lunges forwards to muffle the spin, she\u2019s actually struggling to get back up again. 28th over: Australia 82-3 ( Mooney 7, Perry 36) I like watching Marsh bowl, she\u2019s on tiptoe in her delivery stride, long, elegant arms, almost balletic in her poise. Mooney knocks three from her. And we continue in this arms-length fencing period. Inside Lanning\u2019s mind? 27th over: Australia 80-3 ( Mooney 5, Perry 36) Gordon is flighting the ball nicely and Perry seems content to play her out. Mooney has an ugly swipe to the penultimate ball - she must be the enforcer of the two. 26th over: Australia 78-3 ( Mooney 4, Perry 35) Yummy, yummy says Bel Mooney as a tasty full toss floats towards her from Laura Marsh. Bang, she gets down on one knee and hammers it to the midwicket boundary. She\u2019s certainly happy to gee things along a bit. A session and a half to go... if Australia want to go for the win, they\u2019ll need to pull the declaration from the horizon. Australian lead now 223. 25th over: Australia 73-3 ( Mooney 0, Perry 34) Gordon has a spring in her step now. Some great fielding by Brunt at cover prevents a Mooney boundary. Afterwards she looks accusingly at her elbow in the way you do when it really hurts and you\u2019re hoping for gushing blood and sympathy, but all you get is a slight reddening. And that\u2019s drinks! 24th over: Australia 72-3 ( Mooney 0, Perry 32) Two wicket Marsh continues - her tenth over of the day. A Perryish drive through the covers is the scoring shot of the over. Incidentally, I\u2019ve just come back from Old Trafford where a T20 game is about to start. The place is rammed, queues going into the ground, kids, mums, the works. The ECB fantasy writ large. 23rd over: Australia 67-3 ( Mooney 0, Perry 28) What a wicket! What a pancake delivery! Still they all count - and Gordon strikes in her first over. She has Lanning lunging forwards, front leg unsteadily overbalanced, and then pulling her through midwicket for four, before the breakthrough. Softly, softly, catchee monkey. An absolutely awful ball, pure Sunday evening dross, and Lanning pummels it away where it is caught by an alert Elwiss at cover. Huge breakthrough for England. 22nd over: Australia 60-2 (Lanning 15, Perry 27) I love how Australian field chat addresses teammates as \u201cgirls\u201d but English field chat says \u201cladies\u201d. Lots of encouragement as Marsh bowls another maiden to Lanning. And lots of encouragement, I hope, as Tanya Aldred takes over from me. Thanks for your company, I\u2019ll see you for the first Women\u2019s Ashes T20 and then the men\u2019s Tests. 21st over: Australia 60-2 (Lanning 15, Perry 27) Steam Train Perry rolls on, tooting happily all the while. Neither umpire nor left-arm spinner will stop her. Ecclestone may be tiring a bit, giving width for Perry to drive through cover for four. Time for Kirstie Gordon? She was good in the first innings when she first came on. 20th over: Australia 55-2 (Lanning 14, Perry 23) A quick single for Perry punching Marsh wide of mid-off. Lanning finally gets going when Marsh drags down, allowing the Australian captain to dip and swat a pull shot through long leg. 19th over: Australia 49-2 (Lanning 9, Perry 22) They\u2019re playing two different games out there. Lanning blocks out another maiden from Ecclestone. 43 balls for 9. Perry has faced 38 for 22. 18th over: Australia 49-2 (Lanning 9, Perry 22) Ellyse Perry pushes on, a lot more positive than Lanning at this stage. Flicks a couple off Marsh. 17th over: Australia 46-2 (Lanning 8, Perry 20) Huge lbw shout against Perry, not given! \u201cOut,\u201d say several people at once in the press box, and indeed it should have been. Ecclestone striking flush on the front pad as Perry defended. There was a bit of angle towards leg stump, so the umpire either decided there was a nick or the angle was going down. Neither was true on the replay. Should have been given, would certainly have been challenged by England if there were DRS. An Ashes Test without DRS, let\u2019s remind ourselves. 16th over: Australia 44-2 (Lanning 8, Perry 18) Heather Knight the skipper is setting up at second slip on her knees, following the lead of Marcus Trescothick who has done this a bit here at Somerset. The thicker edges on this wicket can come low. A nice touch that Knight is doing this in front of the Trescothick Stand. Amazing that the big batsman is retiring this year after debuting in first-class cricket in 1993. No lack of bounce for Marsh though, who bowls another beauty through the gate of Lanning, but this time it bounces over her stumps. 15th over: Australia 44-2 (Lanning 8, Perry 18) Perry does it again, making her own length from Ecclestone. Looks so easy for her. Four driving the low full toss through midwicket. 14th over: Australia 40-2 (Lanning 8, Perry 14) Down the wicket, Perry, turning Marsh\u2019s ball into a full toss and driving it straight for four. Nudges a single, then Lanning chops away behind point and belts back for two. Ellyse Perry\u2019s live Test average is now over 70. 13th over: Australia 33-2 (Lanning 6, Perry 9) Huge shout for Ecclestone against Lanning. The left-arm ortho stock ball, turning and beating the outside edge. The toe of the bat just clipped the ankle section of Lanning\u2019s pad as the ball went past. Good umpiring from Martin Saggers. Another maiden. 12th over: Australia 33-2 (Lanning 6, Perry 9) Lanning steers Marsh away past slip for two runs. A bat-pad on either side of the wicket, plus a leg slip. Shrubsole in there I think? Unusual spot for an opening bowler. Good that England are attacking though. They stay in position for Perry. Got to get her early, but her defence is so solid. She isn\u2019t drawn into anything she shouldn\u2019t be. 11th over: Australia 28-2 (Lanning 3, Perry 7) Four runs for Perry, glancing Ecclestone fine. What do the Australian pair do? Do they stay positive and push on, or play safe? They\u2019re 173 in front. 10th over: Australia 23-2 (Lanning 2, Perry 3) Maiden, maiden, maiden, then Perry and Lanning work four runs from Marsh here and there. 9th over: Australia 19-2 (Lanning 1, Perry 0) Eccles to Lanning, up for a huge lbw shout but the ball has struck her just outside the line of off stump. Another maiden. Australia feeling the heat. 8th over: Australia 19-2 (Lanning 1, Perry 0) It\u2019s all spin, all the time, so these will be some shorter updates. Marsh bowls another good over, but one ball bounces so erratically that it evades Taylor for four byes, despite Knight putting in every effort in sprinting after it from slip. 7th over: Australia 15-2 (Lanning 1, Perry 0) A maiden from Ecclestone to Lanning. Perry is yet to face. Just hearing confirmation that Haynes opened the batting because Nicole Bolton has hurt her thumb. 6th over: Australia 15-2 (Lanning 1) Of course, standing between England and bowling anyone out are a) Meg Lanning b) Ellyse Perry Who will now probably just bat for five hours and kill the match. But get one of them early and things will start to get very interesting. 2 for 2 from one over for Marsh in this innings, after batting so well to avert the follow-on. It\u2019s the Summer of Marsh, I\u2019ve been saying this for weeks. And another down, and another one down, another one bites the dust! Last ball of the over, Haynes stretches forward, Marsh straightens the ball down the line to the left-hander from around the wicket. Hits the pad bang in front! Forget declaration bowling, England are just going to bowl them out. (Eight wickets to go, granted.) What a delivery! What a piece of bowling! That\u2019s her Ashley Giles to Damien Martyn in 2005, though with the other arm. Marsh bowls an off-break from around the wicket. Floats it across the right-hander with plenty of drift outside off. Draws Healy forward into a drive, then shreds the ball back in towards the stumps and through the gate. Lovely, lovely bowling. We\u2019re back after lunch with Laura Marsh to bowl... This is terrific. I got an email from Dave Langlois wondering why Sarah Taylor wasn\u2019t wearing keeping pads yesterday. The inside scoop is that they\u2019re inside (scoop). Taylor wears smaller football-style pads inside her trouser legs. You can see the slight outer corner of one in the shot below. 5th over: Australia 13-0 (Haynes 0, Healy 13) The last over before lunch, Healy faces out Ecclestone, chopping away off her stumps at one stage. The final ball is a pie though, which is also what we\u2019re enjoying in the pavilion. Healy drives it straight for four. Time for a meal, with tactical intrigue to follow. There are 76 overs remaining, and Australia lead by 158. 4th over: Australia 9-0 (Haynes 0, Healy 9) It\u2019s a bit of a conundrum for England. They\u2019re diving around in the field, trying to be upbeat. They\u2019ve got two slips and two gullies for Haynes after Healy takes a single from Brunt. But at the same time, they don\u2019t really want to stop runs, because they need Australia to score quickly. And they don\u2019t really want to take wickets, because if a few fall then the Australians will go defensive and try to grind. I guess you can take the positive view of trying to bowl Australia out, but that\u2019s not likely to happen within the 30 overs or so that would leave England in the game. But, it\u2019s worth trying, I guess. It\u2019s good that England are trying something. 3rd over: Australia 8-0 (Haynes 0, Healy 8) If Haynes was sent out to boost the scoring, it hasn\u2019t worked yet. Another maiden facing Ecclestone, with a couple of shots finding the field. Maybe she\u2019s just there to stop Healy doing something reckless against spin. 2nd over: Australia 8-0 (Haynes 0, Healy 8) Now we\u2019re away. As is so often the case these days with Healy at the crease. She gets width from Brunt and threads the needle at point with a square drive for four, then glances a leg-stump ball just past Taylor\u2019s attempted catch and down to fine leg for another. 1st over: Australia 0-0 (Haynes 0, Healy 0) Here we go! Tactical innovations ahoy. Ecclestone is opening the bowling. Four catchers around the wicket! Yes, yes. Australia have sent Haynes out to open with Healy, and Haynes can go at a fast clip when she wants to. Is this to get the score moving or does Nicole Bolton have an injury issue? Eccles nearly gets Haynes immediately! Trying to pull, not short enough and hitting the pad but sliding down leg side. It\u2019s chaotic in there, close fielders and exclamations ahoy. Questions asked each ball. And it\u2019s one of the more eventful maidens you\u2019ll ever see. 107.1 overs: England 275-9 declared (Ecclestone 9) I\u2019m not sure what the point of batting on was, because England have just cost themselves an extra over before the lunch break by facing one delivery from Jonassen that took a wicket. There are now 23 minutes till lunch, we\u2019ll lose two overs for the changeover, and there will be a normal lunch break followed by two extended sessions to make up for the overs lost on day two. The situation is: 83 overs left in the day, and Australia 145 ahead. So, say Australia bat 25 overs, put on another 100+, set England something like 260 and leave themselves something like 56 overs to bowl England out. Are they game? Are both teams game? How will Australia bat? More shortly. Marsh, sweeps, misses, and now England declare. 107th over: England 275-8 (Marsh 28, Ecclestone 9) There it goes! The follow-on is avoided as Marsh carves through cover for four. Declare. Declare! Australia want to keep bowling so Molineux can get five-for. England haven\u2019t gone off. Heather Knight in the rooms is wearing her whites, looking ready to field, but why aren\u2019t they doing it? 106th over: England 270-8 (Marsh 23, Ecclestone 9) One more run to dodge the follow on. Ecclestone doesn\u2019t do it convincingly, backing away and wiping across the line but getting enough toe on that shot to clear mid-on for four. Tries to find that last single, but Jonassen is all over her, flighting and pitching on just the right length and beating the bat repeatedly. 105th over: England 266-8 (Marsh 23, Ecclestone 5) It\u2019s Laura Marsh day, ladies and gentlemen! This is the Marsh who briefly opened in T20s, not the one who made that Test fifty. She smacks Molineux through the covers, then lifts her over midwicket. Back to back boundaries, and the follow-on dodge is only five runs away. 104th over: England 258-8 (Marsh 15, Ecclestone 5) Jonassen to Ecclestone, and this is a gripping over of Test cricket. A maiden, but cat and mouse, the ball flirting with the edge of the bat, Ecclestone just trying to keep it out. She survives. 103rd over: England 258-8 (Marsh 15, Ecclestone 5) Every run being sweated upon by both teams now. Marsh is happy to take a single and let Ecclestone face Vlaeminck. Why not, as Eccles plays a very assured shot off her pads for four! Then farms the strike, though there\u2019s a moment of drama as they half come down for a second, then bail out before there\u2019s a dismissal. 102nd over: England 252-8 (Marsh 14) Sciver out last ball of the over. England are 19 runs adrift of the follow-on avoidance mark. Sophie Ecclestone can bat through. Sciver was furious at that dismissal, she swung her bat wildly in frustration. A Test century goes begging, as it did for Rachael Haynes in the first innings. That will hurt. Next chance will be in late 2021. That\u2019s what Jonassen does! Never the biggest turner or the most imposing, but she\u2019s so accurate and challenges the stumps again and again, with little variations. She nearly gets Sciver by drawing a big leading edge that lands between mid-off and mid-on. But takes her out the very next ball with a cross-seamer going in flat at the stumps, a bit fast and a bit too low as Sciver tried to dab it through backward point, and it takes the underside of Sciver\u2019s glove back onto the stumps. 101st over: England 250-7 (Sciver 87, Marsh 13) Tayla Vlaeminck bowls a bit too full, and Sciver whips off the pads, nicely timed and it will beat long leg for four! Going square of the wicket with that shot. Loses her line down leg a couple of times, allowing Sciver to get another single. A short leg comes in for Marsh, rather than the leg gully from last over, but Marsh backs away a fraction to give room to angle the ball at her body into the gap at cover and get two runs. Not shy about coming back on strike. This has been really smart batting from Marsh today. Follow-on watch: 21 runs. 100th over: England 243-7 (Sciver 82, Marsh 11) After the drinks break it\u2019s Jonassen again. Twice Marsh gets a bottom edge hard into the ground trying to cut. The first goes past her stumps. The second bounces high into the air, comes down to land in front of middle, and then Marsh calmly plays a little late dab to knock it away from the timbers. Alyssa Healy behind them can\u2019t believe it, bursting out into laughter at just how casually Marsh defused that problem. Marsh grins. Play on. 99th over: England 242-7 (Sciver 81, Marsh 11) More moves from Lanning. Nicole Bolton comes up to Healy to fetch a helmet, and... she\u2019s going in to leg gully. Very nice. Vlaeminck is the bowler and will keep going at the ribs. Sciver jabs a single. From around the wicket, the bowler pings in a brilliant bouncer at the head! Marsh is not having a happy time, and leapt away from that ball. This is compelling stuff, and what Vlaeminck brings to a team. Follow-on watch: 29. 98th over: England 241-7 (Sciver 80, Marsh 11) Jonassen goes at the stumps as she always does, and Marsh goes boldy, as the motto goes, by kicking away a ball: not pitching outside leg, as might be normal, but from a left-armer bowling around the wicket. So that ball was pitching on off stump, very much live for an lbw. But angling down leg, and Marsh must have been very confident or very daring. Padded up, and there was no appeal. I know umpires who would have given that out just on principle. Follow-on watch: 30 runs. 97th over: England 240-7 (Sciver 79, Marsh 11) Tayla Vlaeminck will come on for her third spell of the innings. Which is funny, because a third spell is usually what it takes for me to type her name. Ha ha hilarious. No, not really: names aren\u2019t that hard, and hers is basically just Fleming, but in... Flemish. She doesn\u2019t bowl like Damien though. Not pitching it up to swing, but stars this spell pitching it short at Marsh\u2019s body. Once, twice, thrice. Rice. Mice. Nice. In at the hip and for a second there was a risk of Marsh gloving to Healy. Maiden over. 96th over: England 240-7 (Sciver 79, Marsh 11) A bowling change, Jess Jonassen\u2019s left-arm straights for Molineux, who may not get a chance now at a five-for on debut like Betty Wilson. Perhaps in the second innings. Sciver cuts a couple of runs for the only scoring shot. Follow-on watch: 31. 95th over: England 238-7 (Sciver 77, Marsh 11) Now it\u2019s Marsh going again. I\u2019m sorry Laura, I\u2019ve maligned you. Not doing anything crazy, but tapping Gardner\u2019s full toss calmly through cover for four after Sciver took a single. Follow-on watch: 33. 94th over: England 233-7 (Sciver 76, Marsh 7) Molineux bowls an over on the dot, and the only score is a Sciver single. Follow-on watch: 38. 93rd over: England 232-7 (Sciver 75, Marsh 7) Gardner is really looping some balls up, making them wait. Sciver is getting creative, shifting her stance a couple of times to open up the field for singles. Marsh is creative too, down on one knee to lap the ball fine. Follow-on watch: 39. 92nd over: England 229-7 (Sciver 73, Marsh 6) No swamp for Marsh today! She backs away from Molineux to carve a cut shot through cover point, four runs. Stylish and effective, like an Italian autumn wardrobe. Follow-on watch: 42. 91st over: England 225-7 (Sciver 73, Marsh 2) Laaaaarvaly, in Jamie Oliver\u2019s fake Cockney. Ash Gardner on for off-spin from either end. Sciver has had enough. A little shuffle into position, a big back-swing, and a booming straight hit that lands inches inside the rope. That was a mighty boosh. Follow-on watch: 46 to go. 90th over: England 221-7 (Sciver 69, Marsh 2) Molineux again, and Marsh can score runs! Apparently she was going after them in the nets this morning, and now she drives a couple out through cover. That\u2019s the spirit. Three from the over with a Sciver single to move to 69. They\u2019re 50 shy of the follow-on. 89th over: England 218-7 (Sciver 68, Marsh 0) Finally Sciver does see some bowling, and carves Perry through the cordon for four. Perry bowling too wide this morning. Then oversteps for a no-ball, something that umpires have let her get away with a lot in the past. Sciver jabs a run. Then Perry loses a ball down leg side for an extra. She\u2019s probably a bit stiff and sore after the last couple of days. 88th over: England 210-7 (Sciver 63, Marsh 0) Laura Marsh to the middle. Owner of the second-slowest Test half-century by an English player (291 balls) and the one who said after day two that England were still well in this match. Not sure if those are the attributes we need in having England set up the chance of a result. She\u2019s nearly the fifth wicket for Molineux though, inside edging an arm ball past her leg stump. In the meantime Sciver has barely had strike. I don\u2019t mind that. Gone, but doing the right thing in trying to keep the score moving. Shrubsole advances at Molineux to whip through midwicket, but the length is too short for it and Molly has put some scrambled-seam turn on it. Sharply past the outside edge and into Healy\u2019s gloves. Proper off-spin. 87th over: England 210-6 (Sciver 63, Shrubsole 11) A boundary! A sweet, luscious boundary. Get the juices of life coursing through ya. Perry gives a bit of width, and Shrubsole plays a species of cover drive, performed with the motion of a short-arm jab: going staccato at the ball and jarring to a stop at the point of impact, but striking it well enough to split point and cover for four. Shrubsole tries again a couple of balls later, wider and with a lot of bottom hand as she reaches for the ball, but hits it too square to point. Edges the fourth ball, but with soft enough hands along the ground to second slip. Ash Gardner is at gully. Last ball of the over, Shrubsole takes on the short ball! Big top edge, and it loops into the deep for a three. They\u2019re now 61 from the follow-on. 86th over: England 203-6 (Sciver 63, Shrubsole 4) Sophie Molineux bowling to Shrubsole with four around the bat. Slip, gully, bat-pad on either side of the wicket. I like this from Lanning. Pressure on, but also gaps in the field. Shrubsole shuffles, chips a run into one of those gaps wide of mid-on. Escapes the examination, and for Sciver there\u2019s only one slip and a short leg. 85th over: England 202-6 (Sciver 63, Shrubsole 3) Are these signs of intent? Of lovely, lovely intent? Perry has the ball, the great destroyer, but Shrubbers goes after her with an off-drive that misses, then wipes a single through square leg. Perry is getting some swing early in the day too. Just the one run off the over, but some hope to move the game on given the way it was scored. Shrubsole has tripled her score in the blink of an eye. 84th over: England 201-6 (Sciver 63, Shrubsole 2) Right then. Second innings of the match on the fourth morning. England can either try to score with the slightest idea of a win, or continue to block in the hope of a draw. Sophie Molineux the off-spinner starts the day and has taken the new ball. Extra hardness and bounce. Sciver starts cautiously and takes only a late single. Last ball of the over, Shrubsole takes a run! She now has 2 off 37 balls. And away we go. As ever, drop me a line at geoff.lemon@theguardian.com, or on Twitter at @GeoffLemonSport. And if you want to catch up on the situation in more detail, here is Raf\u2019s wrap from yesterday. One thing really stood out to me in yesterday\u2019s play. Here\u2019s an extended thought that I prepared earlier. Right then. What can today bring? In terms of an interesting result, with 108 overs in the day, there are two possible options. One is that England smash another 72 runs in say 15 overs, leaving Australia maybe 30 overs to pile on some runs of their own, then declare to set England a vaguely plausible target. That\u2019s if both sides are willing to take a punt on getting a decent finish and a chance at a result. The second option is that Australia take four wickets in a hurry and make England bat again, meaning there\u2019s a proper survival innings to play for the rest of the day. But the more likely option judging by their play last night is that England won\u2019t try to do either of these things, and we\u2019ll play for a pointless draw. The only points of interest there will be whether any of the bowlers or batters can reach some sort of milestone for their own personal satisfaction, starting with Sciver\u2019s chance at a century and Molineux having a shot at five wickets. Ultimately there is no refuge in a draw for England, because drawing still guarantees they can\u2019t win back the Ashes in this series \u2013 it would leave them trailing 8 points to 2, with 6 possible points in the T20s and Australia retaining the trophy. So they shouldn\u2019t be trying to play out a draw, and they shouldn\u2019t be imagining that saving the match will mean anything. But based on their work last night, I have a sneaking feeling they will do that and think that anyway. Prove me wrong, go on.",

      "bodyText": "The furore over Donald Trump\u2019s racist slurs against four Democratic congresswomen intensified on Sunday, as the president resumed attacking them and posting far-right material online. Trump claimed in a tweet that he did not believe representatives Ayanna Pressley, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib were \u201ccapable of loving our country\u201d. The allegation, made without evidence, was the latest in a series of grave attacks Trump has directed at the four ethnic-minority congresswomen, who hail from the left of the Democratic party and have been sharply critical of his presidency. Last week, Trump said the congresswomen should \u201cgo back\u201d to the countries they came from, despite three of the four having been born in the US and the fourth, Omar, being a US citizen who came to America as a child refugee. Trump supporters at a rally in North Carolina responded to his criticisms of Omar, who fled war in Somalia, by chanting \u201csend her back\u201d. Following widespread condemnation, Trump falsely claimed he had tried to halt the chants. Republicans in Washington have largely supported Trump through the controversy. When the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives voted to officially condemn his racist remarks, only four of 197 Republicans joined the rebuke. On Sunday, Elijah Cummings, a Democrat from Maryland, said statements made by Trump and his supporters reminded him of abuse he received as a black child in the 1960s, at the height of the struggle for civil rights. \u201cI heard the same kind of chant, \u2018Go home, you don\u2019t belong here.\u2019 And they called us the N-word over and over and over again,\u201d Cummings told ABC\u2019s This Week.

Amid criticism of his handling of the supporters in North Carolina, Trump said he had disagreed with their chant, having given no hint of this during the event or in remarks praising the crowd afterwards. He later hailed them as \u201cincredible patriots\u201d. Pence said on Sunday Trump \u201cmight make an effort to speak out about it\u201d if a similar chant broke out in future. Trump attracted further criticism over the weekend by sharing a series of tweets by Katie Hopkins, a far-right British commentator, with his 62 million followers. One of Hopkins\u2019s posts called for a British leader to echo Trump\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t like this country? Then leave\u201d rhetoric.

When pushed, some Republicans, particularly those from swing states likely to decide the outcome of next year\u2019s election, have distanced themselves from Trump\u2019s remarks.

Most took that to mean he did not pursue the obstruction charges in part because of a justice department opinion which holds that a sitting president cannot be indicted.</p> <p>On Sunday, Adam Schiff of California, the House intelligence chair, told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation: \u201cIt\u2019s been clear from Bob Mueller that he felt and the justice department feels bound by this Office of Legal Counsel opinion that you can\u2019t indict a sitting president.\u201d</p> <p>The Russia investigation is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/21/the-man-who-sold-america-joy-ann-reid-trump\">not the only subject of discussion of impeachment</a> and whether Trump has committed \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanours\u201d, a standard not defined in the constitution and thereby forever the subject of debate.</p> <p>In the case of now-closed investigations of campaign finance violations involving former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen making payments to women who claim affairs with Trump, Schiff said the president was \u201cessentially an unindicted co-conspirator\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He is not above the law.

He may have a temporary reprieve\u201d while he is in the White House.</p> <p>Among Democrats, debate rages on about whether impeachment is merited or politically desirable as the 2020 election approaches. Pro-impeachment opinion is strong among supporters and an increasing number of elected officials, contenders for the presidential nomination among them.</p> <p>Mueller\u2019s testimony was initially set for 17 July.

Mueller, a former director of the FBI, will also appear before the intelligence panel. \u201cThe report presents very substantial evidence that the president is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanours,\u201d Nadler said, \u201cand we have to present, or let Mueller present those facts to the American people and then see where we go from there because the administration must be held accountable and no president can be above the law.\u201d Mueller was appointed in May 2017, submitted his report in March 2019 and saw it released with redactions a month later. Attorney general William Barr released a brief summary in which he said conspiracy between Trump and Moscow had not been proven and instances of possible obstruction of justice \u2013 the report details 11 by the president or his campaign \u2013 were not sufficient to establish that an offence had been committed. Mueller, who said in his report he did not exonerate Trump, subsequently gave a press conference in which he said his work should speak for itself. Most took that to mean he did not pursue the obstruction charges in part because of a justice department opinion which holds that a sitting president cannot be indicted. On Sunday, Adam Schiff of California, the House intelligence chair, told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation: \u201cIt\u2019s been clear from Bob Mueller that he felt and the justice department feels bound by this Office of Legal Counsel opinion that you can\u2019t indict a sitting president.\u201d The Russia investigation is not the only subject of discussion of impeachment and whether Trump has committed \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanours\u201d, a standard not defined in the constitution and thereby forever the subject of debate. In the case of now-closed investigations of campaign finance violations involving former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen making payments to women who claim affairs with Trump, Schiff said the president was \u201cessentially an unindicted co-conspirator\u201d. \u201cHe has been identified as \u2018individual one\u2019,\u201d he said, \u201cthe person who directed Michael Cohen to commit this fraudulent campaign scheme. And I assume this all means that in the Southern District of New York, the case will be reopened when he leaves office.\u201d Schiff also said that though Cohen is in prison, Trump is \u201cnot above the law. He may have a temporary reprieve\u201d while he is in the White House. Among Democrats, debate rages on about whether impeachment is merited or politically desirable as the 2020 election approaches. Pro-impeachment opinion is strong among supporters and an increasing number of elected officials, contenders for the presidential nomination among them. Mueller\u2019s testimony was initially set for 17 July. In a tense political standoff, other demands by House committees for testimony from Trump aides and allies have been blocked by the White House. Trump, who has repeatedly and inaccurately claimed exoneration, said this week he would not watch Mueller\u2019s testimony and accused Democrats of \u201cjust playing games\u201d. On Sunday, he tweeted a nonspecific but familiar complaint about \u201cpresidential harassment\u201d and focused on his racist attacks on four progressive Democratic congresswomen. Republicans who will question Mueller have tried to dampen expectations. The hearing will be \u201clike an old TV show that you watched years ago\u201d, Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the judiciary committee, told the Associated Press. \u201cAfter a few minutes you could quote what the characters could say, and nothing is new any more. Frankly, the American people have moved on.\u201d Unsurprisingly, David Ciciline, a Rhode Island Democrat on the same panel, disagreed. He told the AP the hearing would be \u201cthe first opportunity for the American people to hear directly from Mr Mueller about what he found about Russian interference in the American presidential election and efforts by the president to impede, undermine or stop the investigation.\u201d He added: \u201cI do think that the contents of the report are so significant, and so damning, that when Mr Mueller brings them to life, and actually tells the American people \u2026 it will have an impact.\u201d Accordingly, Democrats have been preparing intensely. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, another member of the judiciary committee, told the AP: \u201cThere are still millions of people who think, absurdly, that there is no evidence of presidential obstruction or collusion in the report.\u201d That, he said, was because Barr and Trump have created a \u201cfog of propaganda\u201d. Raskin said: \u201cWe just want to clear the fog.\u201d Nadler told Fox News Sunday any Republican questioning of Mueller about supposed FBI misconduct, an attack line meant to discredit the special counsel\u2019s work, would be an \u201cirrelevancy\u201d and a waste of time. \u201cWhat\u2019s before the American people is the conduct of this president,\u201d he said. \u2022 This article was amended on 22 July 2019 because an earlier version described David Ciciline as a New Jersey Democrat. This has been corrected to say a Rhode Island Democrat.",

I have experienced times when I thought my clearly expressed feelings were overruled by someone I considered to be a friend, someone I trusted.

      "bodyText": "As a single woman who worked as a sexual health adviser in the NHS for almost 20 years, off and on, I would like to commend Ellie Mae O\u2019Hagan for her insightful piece on consent (No wonder women are still afraid to say no, Journal, 18 July). In a culture that is noticeably sexualised, where hardcore porn is easily available and shared by young people via their phones, with no regard for \u201cparental control\u201d, the \u201cworld where women are afraid to say no\u201d is indeed a reality. Unfortunately, even saying \u201cno\u201d is rarely enough. I have experienced times when I thought my clearly expressed feelings were overruled by someone I considered to be a friend, someone I trusted. As a young girl I was constantly reminded that I should remain a virgin and not get pregnant, but these strictures are no longer considered relevant. Some years ago, I found myself dealing with a 14-year-old girl in tears because she was being bullied for not having sex with her male classmates.

Though is it regressive, in its wish for a continual blast-off to the moon, the planets, for and space tourism? If we are to get anywhere near a 2C rise in temperature, we must get rid of the fossil fuel economy. Space cannot be an exception. Derek Smith London \u2022 Fifty years ago I worked as a volunteer in what was then East Pakistan, and when the news of the moon landing appeared I posted a photograph and newspaper article on the noticeboard where I worked. The disinterest in the event among local farmers and cooperative managers was palpable: its relevance to their lives was patently negligible. In a world beset by climate crisis, international instability and mutual distrust, I am hard pushed to see whether the memory of the moon landing has any more meaning today. Dr John Evers Truro, Cornwall \u2022 Technological detritus, a religious tome, clapped-out robots, and bags of poo, urine and vomit (Lunar litter: Junk humans left behind, 20 July). Any aliens landing there would have no trouble identifying who\u2019d been there before them.

      "body": "<p>C\u00e9sar Pelli will be remembered as a designer of world-beating skyscrapers, but for him the quality of his projects was more important than their height. The Argentinian-American architect, who has died aged 92, is best known for the towering landmarks he added to the skylines around the world: the <a href=\"http://www.petronastwintowers.com.my/en\" title=\"\">Petronas Towers</a> in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (formerly the world\u2019s tallest building), One Canada Square in London, the World Financial Center in New York, the Torre de Cristal in Madrid, the Gran Torre Santiago in the Chilean capital, the International Finance Centre in Hong Kong, and the <a href=\"https://pcparch.com/project/salesforce-tower/\" title=\"\">Salesforce Tower</a> in San Francisco.</p> <p>Many of those structures are the among the tallest in their respective city or country, but Pelli preferred to judge his own work in more abstract terms: the emotional responses they generated, the clarity and economy of their designs, and their contribution to their cities as visual symbols, as spaces rather than objects. At the opening of One Canada Square, he quoted the Chinese philosopher Laozi: \u201cThe reality of a hollow object is in the void and not in the walls that define it.\u201d</p> <p>Beyond his skyscrapers Pelli designed a wide range of lower-rise buildings, including the Pacific Design Center in Los Angeles and the National Museum of Art in Osaka, Japan, both of which look like the work of a different designer entirely.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43ec75cdf6324a1fc011f4ad4c6eb71f52d7ddf5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43ec75cdf6324a1fc011f4ad4c6eb71f52d7ddf5/0_147_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I believe it\u2019s a mistake to have a style,\u2019 C\u00e9sar Pelli once said.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I believe it\u2019s a mistake to have a style,\u2019 C\u00e9sar Pelli once said.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denver Post/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI believe it\u2019s a mistake to have a style,\u201d Pelli once said. \u201cWe architects, today we work in too many different places, too many different uses \u2026 we need to be more responsive to what we do. We need to strengthen the quality of a place and not weaken it. If you do your own thing, you are weakening the quality of the place where you build.\u201d</p> <p>Pelli was born in the provincial city of San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n in north-west Argentina. He studied architecture at the National University of Tucum\u00e1n and married his fellow student, <a href=\"http://www.balmori.com/studio/people/diana-balmori-fasla\" title=\"\">Diana Balmori</a>, in 1950. Having won a scholarship to study at the University of Illinois, Pelli and his wife went to the US in the early 1950s and liked it so much they decided to stay.</p> <p>For a decade (1954-64) he worked for the celebrated architect <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Eero Saarinen</a> in Michigan, and then became a US citizen. He contributed to Saarinen\u2019s curvaceous, futuristic TWA Flight Center (<a href=\"https://www.twahotel.com/\" title=\"\">now a hotel</a>) at John F Kennedy Airport, New York, and to two colleges \u2013 Morse and Ezra Stiles \u2013 that Saarinen built for his alma mater, Yale University. It was the beginning of Pelli\u2019s long association with Yale: he was dean of the Yale School of Architecture between 1977 and 1984 and designed other buildings for the campus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"819cf16a4c791255543e33b6f09c6d3f33eb60b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/819cf16a4c791255543e33b6f09c6d3f33eb60b5/0_171_5120_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One Canada Square, London, was designed by Cesar Pelli and completed in 1991.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One Canada Square, London, was designed by Cesar Pelli and completed in 1991.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Thompson/Heritage Images/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1977 he also established his practice (now <a href=\"https://pcparch.com/\" title=\"\">Pelli Clarke Pelli Architects</a>) in Yale\u2019s home city, New Haven, Connecticut, having won the commission to expand the <a href=\"https://pcparch.com/project/museum-of-modern-art-gallery-expansion-and-residential-tower/\" title=\"\">Museum of Modern Art</a>, New York, and build a 56-storey residential tower on top of it.</p> <p>From Saarinen, Pelli inherited a principle of practical modernist minimalism, although his own design sensibility soon distinguished itself. A landmark building was the <a href=\"https://www.pacificdesigncenter.com/pdc-information/\" title=\"\">Pacific Design Center</a>, which became known as the Blue Whale. Its form is audacious: an irregular side profile, reminiscent of an architectural moulding, extruded without variation for the length of an airport terminal and clad in a sleek skin of translucent blue glass.</p> <p>The building made no apparent concession to context or even function; it was a freestanding sculptural object housing exhibition space for design-related businesses. Derided by critics but recognised as a key work of American postmodernism, it put Pelli on the map while giving little indication of where his career was headed.</p> <p>The huge World Financial Center in New York, begun in 1982, was a more accurate signpost. The project, involving four granite and glass towers and a 10-storey public Winter Garden, demonstrated Pelli\u2019s ability to organise large, complex urban schemes, and as the global city landscape came to be dominated by ambitious, corporate-backed commercial developments, Pelli\u2019s practice thrived.</p> <p>The redevelopment of Docklands in London in the 80s brought Pelli a commission for its 770ft (235 metre) high centrepiece: One Canada Square, at the time the tallest tower in the UK. Clad in linen-finished stainless steel panels and capped by a glass pyramid, it became a symbol of Thatcherite capitalism, and for some, an affront to British urban values, by dint of its height if nothing else. \u201cI personally would go mad if I had to work in a place like that,\u201d Prince Charles told Pelli in 1988.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e261669bbdaae3876a14bd3d83599a43cae9c2d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e261669bbdaae3876a14bd3d83599a43cae9c2d6/1417_0_1942_4791/405.jpg\" alt=\"The Torre Sevilla in Seville, Spain, designed by C\u00e9sar Pelli.\" width=\"405\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Torre Sevilla in Seville, Spain, designed by C\u00e9sar Pelli.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Cherepuschak/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Petronas Towers, completed in 1998, brought Pelli an even higher level of global recognition. The commission originally called for a single tall tower and a shorter one beside it; Pelli correctly assessed that it would make more of an impact to build twin towers of equal height \u2013 ultimately 88 storeys \u2013 linked by a sky bridge halfway up. Pelli based the floorplan of the towers on the Rub el Hizb \u2013 an eight-pointed Islamic symbol of overlapping squares. For the first time since 1908, the world\u2019s tallest building (452 metres, or 1,483 ft) was no longer in the US.</p> <p>Pelli\u2019s brand of slick skyscrapers has become something of a global cliche: a non-structural outer skin of glass curtain-wall, a regular floor plan repeated up the majority of the tower, culminating in a more considered crown at the top, and some allusion \u2013 possibly token \u2013 to historical or regional context. But to Pelli at least, each building was different and specific. \u201cI definitely sense that there is an emotional response to the challenge of a tall building,\u201d he said in 2017. \u201cIt\u2019s a very emotional thing, I connect with it, I connect with what the buildings are and what the buildings wish to be, what they seek to be.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://pcparch.com/\" title=\"\">Pelli Clarke Pelli</a> \u2013 the second Pelli is his son, Rafael \u2013 has built more than 100 projects around the world, not only skyscrapers and offices but also residential, educational, civic and cultural buildings. Pelli was named one of the <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">American Institute of Architects</a>\u2019 10 most influential living American architects in 1991, and was awarded the gold medal by the same body in 1995.

A pure climber\u2019s stage, a target for a rider who is going for the mountains jersey, with lots of points available on the three first cat climbs in quick succession: Julian Alaphilippe springs to mind.

      "bodyText": "Anyway, that\u2019s about us. Here\u2019s your stage report \u2013 we\u2019ll be back on Tuesday, after tomorrow\u2019s rest day. Wiggins reckons Thomas is in position to win the thing from here, but also that Ineos need to sort their tactics out. A Sunday jaunt, Alaphilippe-style. Simon Yates gets his stage-winner\u2019s medal. He looks pretty chuffed with life. Pinot is something, isn\u2019t he? You could power a small town off his intensity. Thomas has taken 37 seconds out of Alaphilippe today, which isn\u2019t bad. Thinking again, I think he might\u2019ve gone earlier because he had something left at the end; he can win from here, but it\u2019ll take a colossal effort. Geraint Thomas says he felt better than yesterday and needed to pace it when it all kicked off. He says he got stuck behind Alaphilippe and had the legs to do more \u2013 he\u2019s relieved there\u2019s something in them. He agrees that Pinot is doing well and a danger, then notes that it\u2019s a mental game \u2013 everyone\u2019s tired, everyone\u2019s suffering. He can\u2019t decide if he should\u2019ve gone earlier, but is looking forward to the rest day. And our overall top 10... Our top 10... So Alaphilippe retains the maillot jaune; by how much is still to be confirmed. Alaphilippe rinses to the line, he\u2019s absolutely devastated himself, and I think Thomas takes 30 seconds off him! There\u2019s a lot to do here yet! Now here comes Thomas driving for the line! Pinot finishes 31 seconds or so behind Yates, Landa just behind him. That\u2019s his second-ever stage win. Yates relaxes now, hands off the handlebars... Pinot can\u2019t get to Yates! He\u2019s nearly home! It\u2019s caning it down with rain now, and Thomas bangs it out as Alaphilippe looks to fight back! 639m to go! Thomas powers past Alaphilippe! How much time can he put between them? Thomas goes! Can he get to Alaphilippe? 2.1km to go, the yellow jersey group 2.09 off the lead. Pinot is the only man who can stop Yates now, but there\u2019s so much work to do and so little time in which to do it. Thomas\u2019 tongue hangs out while Alaphilippe weaves from side to side! He is absolutely did. This climb at the end of the stage is sadistic genius. Pinot is going like the absolute clappers, while Yates calmly maintains, looking for his second stage victory. Now back to Pinot, who\u2019s fighting to find Landa! Surely Thomas will go for it soon. He can\u2019t fall further behind if he\u2019s got plans to retain his title. 3.7km to go; this is brilliant stuff, and Pinot keeps hammering away! Bernal doesn\u2019t look to have much left! Landa is struggling to make an impression on Yates, who looks good for the stage win. Thomas still allows Alaphilippe to lead him, or does he have nothing left? Pinot digs again, but Bernal goes with him! Thomas holds on because he senses Alaphilippe doesn\u2019t have much left. But then Alaphilippe goes again! This is hideous! Alaphilippe looks like he might extend his lead tonight, going with Pinot. Can Thomas find something? Pinot follows Bernal, and Alaphilippe can\u2019t respond! Alaphilippe has found something alright! He\u2019s beginning to look like champion! Landa is 1.06 down on Yates with 5.6km to go. Landa, 1.05 behind Yates, is about to catch Geschke! Yates looks really strong, though, so it\u2019ll take a major effort to catch him. And Pinot goes! Alaphilippe goes too, moving past Thomas! David Guadu is setting a ferocious pace now, and it\u2019s hurting pretty much everyone who isn\u2019t him! 6.3km to go! Alaphilippe is suffering! Pinot looks in much better nick, and Thomas is looking a little stronger! Pinot is getting ready! Thomas is up with Alaphilippe! \u201cTwo things,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cFirst; Back To The Future is clearly a wonderful film, but it\u2019s no Grosse Point Blank. Second; I think it was David Sedaris who did an excellent piece on people saying foreign words with an accent. He talked about how one of his lecturers would always ostentatiously pronounce Nicaragua as \u2018Nee-Har-Rah-Wah\u2019, and used that as a shorthand for other flamboyant attempts at accents. For example, some football commentators throw themselves into \u2018Nee-Har-Rah-Wahn\u2019 French when naming the clubs in Ligue Uuuuhn. Also, as a Welshman, obviously I look out for Geraint Thomas\u2019 name in TdF coverage. In this regard, Thomas de Gent is a frustrating distraction that always catches the eye. Too many shared letters. Shouldn\u2019t be allowed.\u201d I do enjoy a good \u201cBraseew.\u201d The state of the kippers as they power up this climb. 8km to go, and Alaphilippe is still with the yellow jersey group. The leaders are 1.26 ahead of the pursuers, 2.33 ahead of the yellow jersey group, and EXCUSE ME WHILE I INTERRUPT MYSELF! Simon Yates goes! Landa is up with Quintana and passes him! 9.2km left! The yellow jersey group have snatched 30s off the leaders, and Landa is moving up towards Quintana! Alaphilippe, meanwhile, is on his bill. Right, here we go! Ineos are hitting it hard, 10.2 km to go! Oh, and Landa\u2019s group are 2.12 off. The yellow jersey group are 3.10 off the lead. We\u2019re at the foot of the finalP Prat d\u2019Albis climb with 11.6km to go. Yates and Getschke lead the way, 1.36 ahead. Bardet, Quintana, Lutsenko and Reichenbach have been joined by D. Martin, G. Martin, K\u00e4mna, Woods and Gallopin. The gap to Geschke and Yates is 1.15. Alaphilippe takes some new peepers from the car. \u201cI really enjoy watching Le Tour even if I wouldn\u2019t be an expert,\u201d tweets Noel Fitzpatrick. \u201cSo tell me, would an Alaphillipe win be like a Leicester, or less of a surprise?\u201d Conor R has already answered: \u201cHard to compare to football - he\u2019s been the best rider this year for the kinds of races he traditionally goes for, so great form and was fancied to win stages in TdF. The surprise is that he seems to have successfully reconditioned himself to be able to tackle the highest climbs. So maybe it\u2019s more like Spurs putting in a serious, convincing challenge for the Premier League next year.\u201d Pinot\u2019s mates drain their pockets for him; he\u2019s about to go! Anyone else sing Bardet to this? Quintana, Lutsenko, Bardet and Reichenbach are 1.02 behind Yates and Geschke. Landa and his mates are trying to get to Quintana\u2019s second group, while Pinot looks primed for an attack through the final climb. I believe they call that \u201ccounter-intuitive\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m probably just a wannabe pedant,\u201dsays Brad McMillan, \u201cbut any Englishman who says choritho, in an English setting, is not to be trusted.\u201d I was agreeing with this, then remembered that I say hummus with a guttual \u201cch\u201d because that\u2019s what it is in Hebrew. I don\u2019t think this is pedantry though, it\u2019s morality. I know the climbs are appalling, but the descents are terrifying. The leaders are absolutely bousting down before undertaking the final climb of the day. I feel ill just watching them. 26.8km to go; the yellow jersey group are 3.08 off the leaders. \u201cSurely, as the Polyglots amongst us should confirm, it should either be as follows,\u201d emails Fraser Bannatyne. \u201cTour de Fronze (said with a Gallic shoulder shrug, whilst holding a coffee and a smouldering Gitane). Or, the more simple Tour OF France.\u201d I think we can allow the \u201cde\u201d because it\u2019s the name of the thing. Incidentally, the poursuivants are 45 seconds off the t\u00eate de la course. \u201cOn pronouncing foreign words,\u201d tweets Alex Cowell. \u201cLet\u2019s face it, it brings out the tension between pedant and anti-pedant in all of us. Tweeting from the airport in Cancoooon.\u201d I hung about round those parts once, and later bumped into someone who asked me if I\u2019d visited Isla Muchere. \u201cNo, but I really loved Isla Majuros.\u201d Geschke is first to Mur de P\u00e9gu\u00e8re, followed by Yates, who has pretty much caught him up. They\u2019re 20 seconds ahead of the next little group. \u201cI was very interested yesterday to hear all the experts bemoaning the demise of G,\u201d says Mark Harrison. \u201cWhat they should have been watching was the way he limited his losses, saving his reserves for another day. The man may be taciturn but he is not a quitter. G stands for gold, solid gold....\u201d I think people were concerned that he looked exhausted, but he\u2019s having a much better day today. The yellow jersey kids are 2.39 off the lead. \u201cHarking back to near the start of the stage,\u201d emails Guy Hornsby, \u201cI\u2019ll second and third that, Back To The Future is almost pefect, Daniel. Lets forget about the Trump-esque sequel, though I\u2019m fond of their wild west adventures. The question is, who would be the protagonists from the current peloton? I\u2019d have said our yellow jersey holder had shades of Doc Brown, but he\u2019s way too consistent now, so that goes to Sagan (and of course Tommy Voeckler in the past). Not sure about Marty. Fresh-faced local good guy... Gaudu?\u201d BTTF II was the first film I saw in the cinema that properly knocked me senseless \u2013 I was in Junior 4 and all the yeargroup teachers were ill, so we got two days off. Simon Yates has had enough and leaves the chasing group, while it seems that Castroviejo, Moscon, Van Baarle and Kwiatkowski \u2013 all of Team Ineos \u2013 have been lozzed by the yellow jersey group. 39.4km to go now, and will Geschke\u2019s break get him a stage win?His lead is 34s, down from 40s, so perhaps not. It\u2019s foggy as you like at the top of this climb. Mikel Landa has a shy from the yellow jersey group! Jakob Fugslang goes with him! The break has dumped Bilbao, Fraile and Roche. Have a look! Geschke is 35 second clear now, while Alaphilippe has been isolated! Thomas shadows him and things are hotting right up! \u201cA real grammatical grey area this,\u201d emails Chris Collinson. \u201cFile alongside sports teams teams taking both the singular and plural forms. However, pronouncing grammar in the non English accent always sounds slightly pretentious \u2013 \u2018Paris or \u2018Paree\u2019 being the worst offender.\u201d People who talk about \u201cMichellan\u201d stars and \u201cParmegyan\u201d. \u201cLook out for Ineos\u2019 Bernal and Thomas in first and second on the podium in Paris!\u201d emails Elston Wade. \u201cBernal will demolish the contenders in the mountains!\u201d Simon Geschke pulls himself away from the leading group as they near the end of this frankly revolting climb. He leads by 15 seconds or so with 42.8km to go. Etiquette question: if you\u2019re English, is it \u201cTour de France\u201d or \u201cTour de Fronze\u201d? The leading group now comprises: Bardet, Gallopin, Molard, Reichenbach, Quintana, Amador, Soler, Bilbao, Fraile, Lutsenko, Woods, S. Yates, Geschke, D.Martin, Bernard, Ciccone, Kamna, Roche, Herrada, G.Martin and Kreuziger.The peloton is 4.01 behind. The Mur de P\u00e9gu\u00e8re climb is getting going \u2013 the steepest of the entire race. It doesn\u2019t look too bad to me, no idea what all the fuss is about. \u201cBarm!\u201d responds Brad McMillan. \u201cI\u2019ll stick with muffin thanks, I grew up in Hampshire!\u201d Reported. Nothing to do with cycling, but I believe Harrance Kane has just scored from the halfway line. Quintana hits the front with 49km to go. Is he ... enjoying this? 52.1km to go as Brad McMillan gets in touch: \u201cI didn\u2019t learn the term polka dot from those marbles,\u201d he says, \u2018because they\u2019re spotted dicks. The only marble I kept (in the loft somewhere) from my childhood collection was a spotted dick triple emperor pearl, I never lost with it. Anyway... the cycling!\u201d It\u2019s a barm. Shut up! Ah, it\u2019s not just Nibali who\u2019s been absorbed back into the peloton but Mollema and Matthews too. \u201cI\u2019ve no searing analysis or insight to provide,\u201d brags Gareth Evans, \u201cI\u2019m dramatically hung over, but I have noticed that the team name Trek Segefredo scans nicely to the tune of Smoke On The Water and am mumbling it to myself. Much to my wife\u2019s annoyance.\u201d She\u2019s quite right; you should be singing it at the top of your voice. Nibali has been dropped from the chasing group, as Bradley \u201cBrad\u201d Wiggins tells us that the winner will come from the group which currently leads. Who didn\u2019t learn the term \u201cpolka dot\u201d from these? 64.5km to go as Bardet hits the front of the sprint, taking maximum points! Someone thinks they look good in polka dots! Quintana is back! He leads Martin and Kreuziger. Thibaut Pinot is a belter of a rhyming name, up there with Gokdeniz Karadeniz which I think is a pararhyme (please correct me). \u201cYates, Reichenbach and Molard, Roche and Lutsenko formed seminal Grind core collective \u2018Trojan Death Overkill\u2019, much favoured by John Peel back in the day,\u201d emails Chris Collinson.\u201d As we\u2019ve said, riders love to suffer. Other great Guillaumes: Hello! Michael Woods, Omar Fraile and Guillaume Martin join the leaders! Quintana heads a group 18 seconds off the lead now, and the peloton are 4.37 behind as we near one of the three grade one climbs. The leaders are: Rudy Molard, S\u00e9bastien Reichenbach (Groupama-FDJ), Alexey Lutsenko (Astana Pro Team), Simon Yates (Mitchelton-Scott), Lennard K\u00e4mna, Nicholas Roche (Team Sunweb), Jes\u00fas Herrada (Cofidis), Romain Bardet, Tony Gallopin (Ag2r La Mondiale), Dan Martin (UAE Team Emirates), Giulio Ciccone (Trek-Segafredo), Roman Kreuziger (Dimension Data) and Andrey Amador (Movistar Team). Apparently my email wasn\u2019t quite right above, so if you\u2019d like to get in touch, please refresh your page or just click on daniel.harris.casual@theguardian.com. Er, as I was saying, Quintana has dropped off the leading group, and as the best-placed rider in that collection, the yellow jersey doesn\u2019t look under threat today. \u201cI\u2019m firmly in the Anyone But Ineos camp,\u201d says an anonymous emailer, \u201cso I\u2019d be delighted if Alaphilippe takes it all the way to Paris. But I wouldn\u2019t call two minutes definitive with so many climbs to come and I\u2019d never underestimate Ineos\u2019s power to sway things their way - especially when they\u2019ve got two in the top five. Let\u2019s also not forget Simon Yates\u2019s fate in the Giro (sorry Simon). Fingers crossed Alaphilippe will do it though!\u201d Bardet and Amador join the leaders too - there are now eight of them. Meanwhile, Wellens is struggling and has been dropped by the peloton. Yates, Reichenbach and Molard lead ... and now Roche and Lutsenko join them! The leading group: Gallopin, Caruso, Tratnik, Molard, Reichenbach, Soler, Bilbao, Groendahl Jansen, S. Yates, Geschke, Bernard, Ciccone, Roche and Herrada. We see Simon Yates putting it in \u2013 he\u2019s attacking! Nibali, who looks bushed from yesterday, is in what\u2019s just become a second group of leaders - if that\u2019s possible. Bardet, Quintana, Zakarin and Woods are also there! \u201cIt really comes down to who\u2019s got the legs,\u201d we\u2019re told, and suddenly I find myself singing this. We\u2019re climbing at Port de Lers; the riders are mainly standing again. At the front, Politt ploughs on, looking to open up a little lead. We all love zane. Our next test is on tap as the distance remaining dips below 80km. The gap to the peloton is now 3.23. Quintana in particular will be loving this. I mentioned N\u00eemes earlier, more than enough excuse to post this. Nico Portal was asked what was said to Geraint Thomas yesterday. \u201cNot much\u201d. More insight as I get it. The pace has relaxed a little now, as the leaders glide through a village.But now we have an intermediate sprint! Caruso tries to attack, looking to help team-mate Sonny Colbrelli, but Matthews rinses him and Nils Politt. It\u2019s pretty cloudy in the Pyrenees today, but fear not; in N\u00eemes, where we\u2019re headed after tomorrow\u2019s rest day, it\u2019s 36-38 degrees. I\u2019m feeling faint just thinking about it. We\u2019ve got 94.6km to go; there are three climbs in the final 60. In commentary, they\u2019re wondering whether Alaphilippe has the back-up to get through the Alps, before noting that they\u2019ve been wondering about him all the way through the race and he\u2019s answered every question so far. The break lead the peloton by 2.33. Geraint Thomas, meanwhile, is having lunch. He\u2019ll be hoping he\u2019s got more in the tank than yesterday, where he just sor tof expired. Alexey Lutsenko has a drink. I doubt I\u2019ve ever experienced pleasure so intense in my life. Frank, Matthews, Sicard, Perichon, Politt, Bouet and Perez have caught up with the lead group. Decent job of work. 112km to go. The first hour was 27km/h for the first hour; it\u2019s slowed a little now, but only a little. The leading group are now 2.33 ahead of the rest. We see that Alaphilippe is one of them, and he looks pretty chill. They\u2019ve got a couple of minutes on the peloton now. There are 28 riders in the break, and these are they: Patrick Konrad (Bora-Hansgrohe), Romain Bardet and Tony Gallopin (AG2R-La Mondiale), Vincenzo Nibali, Damiano Caruso and Jan Tratnik (Bahrain-Merida), Rudy Molard and S\u00e9bastien Reichenbach (Groupama-FDJ), Nairo Quintana, Andrey Amador and Marc Soler (Movistar), Pello Bilbao, Omar Fraile and Alexey Lutsenko (Astana), Michael Woods (EF Education First), Simon Yates (Mitchelton-Scott), Simon Geschke (CCC), Julien Bernard, Giulio Ciccone and Bauke Mollema (Trek-Segafredo), Dan Martin (UAE Team Emirates), Lennard K\u00e4mna and Nicolas Roche (Sunweb), Jesus Herrada (Cofidis), Ilnur Zakarin (Katusha-Alpecin), Romain Kreuziger (Dimension Data) and Guillaume Martin (Wanty-Groupe Gobert) and Ama\u00ebl Moinard (Ark\u00e9a-Samsic). The break is nicely installed now, around 30s ahead of the rest, led by Quintana; Nibali is one of those with him. Pinot has stopped for a slash, and Alaphilippe is in the first group behind the leaders. Konrad, Bardet, Nibali, Caruso goes the psychopathic order as the climb continues. There are a couple more in amongst them, but the gap isn\u2019t significant yet. They\u2019re standing in the saddle now, as Bardet moves to the front. This might be the moment! We\u2019re on the Col de Monts\u00e9gur, a second-level climb, and Caruso has been yanked back. Is Back to the Future the greatest film of the 80s? And of all-time? What it is for sure is perfection. The climb is now upon us; or \u201cus\u201d, I should say. There\u2019s been a split! Caruso leads everyone, pounding away perhaps 20m away, and the peloton is now in two pieces. They\u2019ve covered 47km in the first hour. Where\u2019s Mr Strickland when you need him? King and Poels are now on the attack, but there\u2019s no indication that they\u2019ll get anywhere; we\u2019re 7km from the start of the climb. Good luck, lads. The climb begins in around 12km, so expect an effective break by then. But you really never know. Oss makes another move. He looks pretty sprightly, and also kind of spritely. Nibali is also up the front, but the peloton have pretty much caught up; after 40km, we\u2019re basically where we were when we started, except everyone is in even more pain. I feel slightly nauseous just looking at the incline. Riding up it, Bardet gasps for air. The peloton is splitting at the front: Romain Bardet is on the attack, and Jack Haig is going with him, Oss and a few others too. The chaps are heading uphill now and approaching the first climb of the stage. Vincenzo Nibali takes it on, and oh my days, Bradley Wiggins is wearing a union jack anorak. He just wants to be different. They\u2019re setting a pretty fearsome pace here, which should favour the expert climbers later on. Serge Pauwels decides he fancies a go. He opens up a lead of roughly 34cm, then the pack swallows him up. So lazy. There are spectators wearing cycling gear. Let\u2019s give them the benefit of the doubt and say they rode over. Julien Bernard has a little shy at a break, then Michael Woods takes it up. No one can get away. Scully is close to the front, but stops short of mounting a proper attack. They\u2019re setting it up and setting it up as the incline gently increases; if the stage were a jungle tune, the drop would be imminent. Haller is summarily reeled in, and Mohoric takes it on. Marco Haller, who\u2019s ridden more competitive miles this term than anyone else, has a bash at a break. The scenery on this stage is absolutely lush, loads of green-covered peaks. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s significant compensation when you feel like you might die. Oss now leads, from Cosnefroy. Damiano Caruso is now at the front, but the peloton has closed. Sven Erik Bystr\u00f8m of UAE Team Emirates is having a dart. He leads by about 10 metres, but it doesn\u2019t much look like a decisive break. It must be a right laugh setting the course for this. \u201cHow can inflict most pain on these?\u201d \u201cHow about an uphill finish?\u201d \u201cChauette!\u201d Sagan catches up with an attempted breakaway \u2013 there are six of so riders maybe three metres clear of the rest. No one has yet put their foot down. Various of the chaps are moving to the front \u2013 De Gendt, Mohoric, Wellens, Teuns, Geschke, W\u00fcrtz Schmidt and Naese amongst others \u2013 checking to see whether anyone comes with, then allowing themselves to be caught. This is going to be brutal. Talking of brutal... Thomas is already at the front of the group. We\u2019re expecting a succession of attacks through the stage, which should make for an entertaining little jaunt. And off we go! The d\u00e9part is almost upon us. I had some glasses of wine last night. These lads don\u2019t even know they\u2019ve been born. Wiggins reckons yesterday\u2019s stage winner, Thibaut Pinot, will win again today. That\u2019d be an absolutely ludicrous effort. Bradley Wiggins is showing off his tattoos on Eurosport; I can\u2019t even. He thinks today is do or die for Thomas, and if Alaphilippe is wearing yellow at teatime, he\u2019ll be very difficult to stop. This is a phenomenal photo. Here\u2019s William Fotheringham\u2019s stage guide: A second summit finish in a row, and a different proposition with two first category mountain passes beforehand, both short and brutally steep, as is the ascent to the chequered flag. A pure climber\u2019s stage, a target for a rider who is going for the mountains jersey, with lots of points available on the three first cat climbs in quick succession: Julian Alaphilippe springs to mind. There should be a straightforward selection among the yellow jersey contenders who should be down to a handful by now. It\u2019s the kind of stage that screams Egan Bernal or Nairo Quintana. Whenever I think about Le Tour, I think about something Mark Cavendish once said: \u201cIt means something to suffer that much\u201d. Well, after yesterday\u2019s Tourmalet, which included the bonanza of 3,000m-odd of climbing, it looks very much like this year\u2019s suffering champion will be Julian Alaphilippe. With seven stages left, he leads Geraint Thomas by 2.02, and it\u2019s increasingly tricky to see that gap as anything other than definitive. Today, the sufferers take on the final Pyrenees stage, which includes, among its 185km, three major climbs: the Port de Lers, the Mur de P\u00e9gu\u00e8re and the delicious uphill finish at Prat d\u2019Albis. What better way to pass a lazy Sunday?",

      "bodyText": "Thibaut Pinot exploded the status quo in the Tour de France, blowing both Geraint Thomas and Julian Alaphilippe off his back wheel in the Pyrenean mist, as Simon Yates took his second stage win at the summit finish to stage 15 at Foix Prat d\u2019Albis.

For all his easygoing demeanour \u2013 when George Bennett admonished French fans for booing the Welshman as he rode alongside the New Zealander near the summit of the Tourmalet on Saturday, Thomas tweeted \u201cI think they were booing you mate\u201d \u2013 he still does not appear to have the legs to win this Tour de France. \u201cHe\u2019s done a lot of work,\u201d Brailsford said of Thomas at the first rest day, when final victory had seemed inevitable. \u201cHe\u2019s come a long way since January.\u201d But after an autumn spent at book launches, awards ceremonies and on Graham Norton\u2019s sofa, it may prove to be too little, too late. With the Alps looming, Ineos must surely move from plan G to plan B, in the wiry figure of Bernal. \u201cI don\u2019t really mind who wins the race,\u201d Brailsford said. \u201cAs a Grand Tour contender, Egan\u2019s recovery and his ability to maintain his performance is one of his greatest strengths. The harder the race gets, the better he gets.\u201d Tactically, Thomas admitted he was stuck between a \u201crock and a hard place\u201d, while Bernal remained diplomatic. \u201cGeraint and I have good communication between us, and we are both honest,\u201d the Colombian said. \u201cWe need to win the race as Ineos, not as Geraint or Egan. So we need to be honest.\u201d",

It takes our bodies one day to adjust to a time difference of one hour, so Gardiner recommends pre-emptively adjusting our clocks at home: one hour a day towards the time zone to which you are travelling, no more than three days before travelling. \u201cIf the duration of travel is less than the number of time zones you travel across, you need to plan \u2013 getting your body used to the new time zone will help you adjust much faster.\u201d Mind what you eat \u2013 and when \u201cDiet plays a large part in setting the body clock,\u201d says Lisa Artis, an adviser at the Sleep Council, which promotes healthy sleep habits. \u201cOnce you are on the plane, set your watch to the local time at your destination, then eat according to normal meal times at your destination.\u201d Heavy meals increase our sleep drive, so a balanced diet helps kickstart our body clock into its destination timings. Avoid caffeine and alcohol Be sure to drink plenty of water. Gardiner says that our body clocks can be set off-kilter by dehydration. \u201cPeople don\u2019t drink enough water on planes and often replace it with alcohol, which is a depressant and dehydrating, or they drink too much caffeine, which keeps you awake,\u201d she says. \u201cYour body needs to re-adjust naturally to its new time zone and it\u2019s not advisable to manipulate it.\u201d Schedule light exposure Dr Guy Meadows, a co-founder of the insomnia treatment service Sleep School, recommends getting 20 to 30 minutes of natural light exposure the morning after arriving at your destination. \u201cOur body clocks are connected to light-receptive cells in our eyes, so making sure to darken down throughout the day is a very powerful way of synchronising with your new environment,\u201d he says. Go west If you are adamant about avoiding jet lag, travelling west \u2013 and therefore lengthening your day by going backwards through time zones \u2013 will alleviate the symptoms. Timings your flights is also important \u2013 Meadows says that we need at least 10 hours of wakefulness to induce a restful sleep. Factoring this into your flight time, and arriving after sunset, will help adjust your schedule.",

      "bodyText": "Animal rights organisations and activists have accused the Latitude festival organisers of cruelty for dyeing a flock of sheep pink as part of a marketing campaign. A promotional tweet posted on the opening day of the Suffolk event showed fuchsia-dyed sheep running across the festival grounds. Social media users quickly criticised the organisers for dyeing the sheep and demanded an explanation. Latitude defended the stunt, and tweeted that the animals had been \u201cdip-dyed using natural, water-based dye which they are used to as part of their normal farm life for insecticides and parasites like itch-mite, blow-flies, ticks and lice\u201d. But the animal rights organisation Peta UK condemned Latitude\u2019s actions as a \u201cthoughtless, attention-grabbing stunt\u201d. \u201cIn 2019, only ignorant or cruel people still use animals as living toys, props and photo ops,\u201d it said on Twitter. \u201cWe\u2019ve learned enough about animals to know to respect and admire them for their ability to live in a world we\u2019re fast destroying.\u201d Peta said the dip-dyeing of the sheep \u201cinvolves being completely submerged in liquid, their heads likely held down with a crook. And the abuse didn\u2019t stop there. These gentle prey animals are easily stressed and would have been terrified of the loud music and rowdy, drunk festivalgoers.\u201d The animal welfare charity RSPCA also expressed criticism, saying it was \u201cvery sad\u201d to see sheep being treated in this way. A petition has been set up calling on Latitude to stop using the sheep as \u201cparty props\u201d and to remove the animals from the festival grounds. Members of the public announced a boycott of Latitude and called on others to follow suit. East Suffolk council said on behalf of Latitude that it had \u201cno concerns about the sheep this year or in the 14 years that this activity has taken place\u201d. \u201cWe are entirely happy that the water-based dye is completely safe and that the festival organisers have taken all appropriate steps to ensure the animals are content, safe and well-looked after,\u201d the council added. \u201cAs part of our wide-ranging licensing and environmental health responsibilities, the council takes the welfare of all animals very seriously and if we had encountered any issues or felt that the sheep were suffering distress of any kind we would not permit such an activity.\u201d The festival in Henham Park, which this year featured headline sets from Lana Del Rey and Stereophonics, is billed as a family festival with a broad cultural programme alongside activities such as lake swimming and wellness treatments. Latitude was named best major festival in 2017 and best family festival in 2018 at the UK Festival awards. \u2022 This article was amended on 23 July 2019. An earlier version incorrectly said Snow Patrol played a headline set at Latitude; the band were due to perform but were replaced by Stereophonics.",

Flat racing\u2019s midsummer highlight will be billed as a clash between the dual Arc winner Enable and the doughty Crystal Ocean, but only the foolhardy will fail to consider the claims of Atzeni aboard one of this season\u2019s surprise packages, Defoe. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely improved,\u201d the jockey says as we mull over the grey\u2019s prospects in the Newmarket weighing room. He praises the trainer Roger Varian and work rider Korrie Hall for the progress they have wrought from Defoe. But more will be needed if Atzeni is to get the better of Enable\u2019s rider, his friend and compatriot Frankie Dettori. There is something approaching reverence in Atzeni\u2019s voice when he discusses the older man, for all that they have been riding against each other for a dozen years. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking up to Frankie since I was a kid,\u201d he says. \u201cI still do it now.\u201d This does not mean any quarter is given on the track.

      "body": "<p>The most important rule for any sexually active woman is to empty their bladder within 15 minutes of sex. Whether it is same-sex, with a sex toy or heterosexual intercourse, unless you empty your bladder you are more likely to get a urinary tract infection (UTI), which can be very uncomfortable and can lead to bigger problems. The reason that women get UTIs after sex is that the urethra is very short and the bladder is close to it, so during penetrative sex you are allowing bacteria direct access to your bladder.</p> <p>We don\u2019t know why some people are more susceptible to UTIs than others, but post-menopausal women should be extra-careful, because as a reduction in oestrogen leads to the tissue being thinner, making it harder to fight infection. Even if your partner is a clean person you are still at risk; using a condom or being circumcised doesn\u2019t make a difference. Penetrative sex upsets the natural balance of your body so always make sure to go to the bathroom afterwards.</p> <p>What women must avoid is douching. Intra-vaginal douching or cleansing disrupts the delicate natural balance of the vaginal bacteria, which maintains a status of health. It reduces the amount of <em>lactobacillus</em>, the bacterium that promotes acid and suppresses the growth of unnatural germs. By attempting to clean your body, you are actually exposing yourself to a higher risk of infection.</p> <p>For men and women, there is often a desire to feel less \u201cwet\u201d after sex. If this is the case, gentle cleansing of your external genitalia with water is perfectly safe \u2013 no scrubbing is required, and avoid harsh soaps. It is a myth that you can \u201cwash away\u201d sexually transmitted infections after sex by showering or douching, so being anticipatory is vital: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/apr/14/how-to-use-a-condom-safely\" title=\"\">use a condom</a>.</p> <p><em>Dr Barb DePree is a gynaecologist and founder of </em><em>the online women\u2019s sexual health resource <a href=\"https://middlesexmd.com/\" title=\"\">MiddlesexMD.com</a>.

We don\u2019t know why some people are more susceptible to UTIs than others, but post-menopausal women should be extra-careful, because as a reduction in oestrogen leads to the tissue being thinner, making it harder to fight infection. Even if your partner is a clean person you are still at risk; using a condom or being circumcised doesn\u2019t make a difference. Penetrative sex upsets the natural balance of your body so always make sure to go to the bathroom afterwards. What women must avoid is douching. Intra-vaginal douching or cleansing disrupts the delicate natural balance of the vaginal bacteria, which maintains a status of health. It reduces the amount of lactobacillus, the bacterium that promotes acid and suppresses the growth of unnatural germs. By attempting to clean your body, you are actually exposing yourself to a higher risk of infection. For men and women, there is often a desire to feel less \u201cwet\u201d after sex. If this is the case, gentle cleansing of your external genitalia with water is perfectly safe \u2013 no scrubbing is required, and avoid harsh soaps. It is a myth that you can \u201cwash away\u201d sexually transmitted infections after sex by showering or douching, so being anticipatory is vital: use a condom.

Anna Gryszkiewicz, who is 39 and lives in \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland in Sweden, was diagnosed with sensorineural hearing loss in her 20s and began using captions. Mostly, she sees the rise in captioning as a positive development: \u201cIt has been so much easier to find or to request captions today, compared to 15 years ago.\u201d Deaf people, she adds, \u201chave such an advantage living today\u201d.</p> <p>The rise of big tech brings with it concerns over the quality of subtitling. YouTube uses <a href=\"https://mashable.com/2016/11/11/youtube-closed-captioning-nomorecraptions/?europe=true\">often garbled</a>, computer-made captions. \u201cMy main worry is the over-belief in technology, such as autocaptions,\u201d says Gryszkiewicz. \u201cI\u2019m an engineer and love technology, but we cannot lose sight of the social aspects of hearing loss. Language, communication and social interactions are complex. The effect of having hearing loss or being deaf is different from what hearing people imagine it to be \u2013 and the impact on communication is often underestimated.</p> <p>\u201cI understand that good captions and other accessibility features are expensive and it\u2019s not unreasonable to look into technology to reduce costs, but I hope our opinions are taken seriously when we try to explain what kind of accessibility is helpful and what isn\u2019t.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"550a1778e6bb46474642e47309d8a2c3300ca9de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/550a1778e6bb46474642e47309d8a2c3300ca9de/0_0_4147_2488/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Keeping up \u2026 commuters are increasingly using subtitles on noisy trains.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keeping up \u2026 commuters are increasingly using subtitles on noisy trains.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Gee/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This sense of prioritising which shows do and don\u2019t get subtitles, as well as what form they should take, is picked up by Jess Reid from the charity Action on Hearing Loss. \u201cOfcom tells us that a third of the UK\u2019s on-demand service providers offer no subtitles at all,\u201d she says. \u201cWithin the last week, we\u2019ve had complaints about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/britains-got-talent\">Britain\u2019s Got Talent</a> having subtitles when shown on TV \u2013 and not having this for on-demand. And that is just one example. We regularly get complaints about popular TV shows, from Game of Thrones to Love Island, where people with deafness and hearing loss are still kept out of the conversation.\u201d<br><br>Programme-makers, though, do have objections. <a href=\"https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/elliott-arndt-film-271016\">Elliott Arndt</a>, a director of music videos and short films, has aesthetic concerns about subtitles. \u201cI like to use them as a graphic element of [a] composition, as well as the usual informative tool,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that\u2019s not always something I\u2019m after. Sometimes, I\u2019d much rather have to do without and keep an unspoilt image \u2013 but the message you\u2019re trying to get across just needs it. So I try to make it a part of the video in an interesting way. I just use it as a graphic, where it comes in to underline specific words at different moments. I think, for a lot of people, it\u2019s hard to feel immersed in the picture if you\u2019re having to read something that\u2019s \u2018on\u2019 the picture.\u201d<br><br>Like many others, though, Arndt agrees that the mainstreaming of subtitles is doing more good than harm, making visual media more accessible, understandable and dynamic. \u201cMaking subtitles obligatory could be a really interesting way to push people to find a new system,\u201d he says, \u201csomething that\u2019s not going to ruin the visual experience but also could be more tailored to everyone\u2019s needs.\u201d</p> <p>Deafinitely Girly is resoundingly positive about the possibilities. \u201cThe more people who use subtitles, the better,\u201d she says. \u201cIt would be great if they were mandatory across all streaming services and at least 50% of cinema showings.\u201d Such a change would allow her to see new releases at the weekend with her hearing husband. Besides, it would mean that the norm was inclusive, rather than exclusive.</p> <p>\u201cI find my deafness incredibly isolating at times,\u201d says DG. \u201cYou miss out on jokes on social media videos, viral clips don\u2019t mean anything, and you can\u2019t follow the latest news that\u2019s being live tweeted. Subtitles being universal would change that massively.\u201d</p>",

So I try to make it a part of the video in an interesting way. I just use it as a graphic, where it comes in to underline specific words at different moments. I think, for a lot of people, it\u2019s hard to feel immersed in the picture if you\u2019re having to read something that\u2019s \u2018on\u2019 the picture.\u201d Like many others, though, Arndt agrees that the mainstreaming of subtitles is doing more good than harm, making visual media more accessible, understandable and dynamic. \u201cMaking subtitles obligatory could be a really interesting way to push people to find a new system,\u201d he says, \u201csomething that\u2019s not going to ruin the visual experience but also could be more tailored to everyone\u2019s needs.\u201d Deafinitely Girly is resoundingly positive about the possibilities. \u201cThe more people who use subtitles, the better,\u201d she says. \u201cIt would be great if they were mandatory across all streaming services and at least 50% of cinema showings.\u201d Such a change would allow her to see new releases at the weekend with her hearing husband. Besides, it would mean that the norm was inclusive, rather than exclusive. \u201cI find my deafness incredibly isolating at times,\u201d says DG. \u201cYou miss out on jokes on social media videos, viral clips don\u2019t mean anything, and you can\u2019t follow the latest news that\u2019s being live tweeted. Subtitles being universal would change that massively.\u201d",

Zapata said his flight had been approved by civil aviation authorities but not maritime officials who insisted stationing a ship to refuel the flyboard would pose a risk to shipping in the busy Channel. \u201cWe have advised against the crossing because it is extremely dangerous given the traffic in the Channel, one of the busiest (shipping) straits in the world,\u201d the French maritime authority said. An official added that authorities were not banning the crossing and had asked Zapata to inform the French coastal search and rescue team before he took off \u201cin case of any problems\u201d. Zapata said the decision had forced him to refuel once midway, instead of twice as he had planned \u2013 once in French waters, once in UK waters. \u201cThis has made the challenge 10 times more difficult,\u201d Zapata said. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely arbitrary and unreasonable decision.\u201d He added that the take-off time would depend on weather conditions and he had not yet decided whether to refuel the kerosene-powered flyboard by landing on a ship or hovering over it, the latter being more risky but which would enable him to claim a true \u201ccross-Channel flight\u201d.

On top of all of that \u2013 and it really is hard to imagine how turbulent this 22-year-old\u2019s life has been at times \u2013 Wesley fulfilled his dream of making it as a professional footballer despite having one leg that is almost three centimetres shorter than the other.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/who-scored-blog/2019/jul/11/aston-villa-mistakes-fulham-summer-transfer-window-signings\">Are Aston Villa repeating mistakes Fulham made last summer? Not at all</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHe was born like this, of course,\u201d says Hans Coret, who works closely with Paulo Nehmy, Wesley\u2019s Brazilian agent. \u201cWhen Paulo met Wesley the first time, he went to the former doctor of the national team of Brazil. He checked out the leg and he said: \u2018You will never have any problem with this, it\u2019s how he is, never change anything.\u2019 It\u2019s amazing. But you know the story of Garrincha in Brazil \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Garrincha, Brazil\u2019s unique and brilliant World Cup winner, is also referred to at Trencin, the Slovakian club where Wesley first made his name in European football, earning a move to Club Brugge in January 2016. \u201cIt is interesting because sometimes it looks like Wesley\u2019s limping on the pitch by the way that he walks,\u201d Robert Rybnicek, Trencin\u2019s general manager, says. \u201cBut he\u2019s so quick. He\u2019s a special guy.\u201d</p> <p>Brugge picked up on Wesley\u2019s unusual physical profile during his medical. He was only 19 years old at the time and the Belgian club were initially concerned about injury prevention. Yet Wesley has never experienced any problems in that respect and, as with Garrincha, whose left leg was six centimetres longer than his right, his body had learned to compensate for any imbalance a long time ago.</p> <p>Finding stability off the field was harder and inevitably clubs delved into that chaotic backstory. \u201cWe knew everything,\u201d D\u00e9vy Rigaux, Brugge\u2019s team manager, says. \u201cWe had a very clear screening of the player before signing him. There was a long conversation with a psychologist on one side and with us, the people of the club, on the other side, on the social aspects. We felt during these conversations that he was a boy with a very good heart, with really good values in life, which were necessary in our environment to become the right football player.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you lose the father at an early age, and you become yourself a father when you are a kid at 15, it has an impact</p> <footer> <cite>D\u00e9vy Rigaux</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf you lose first of all the father at an early age, and you become yourself a father when you are still a kid, at 15, it has an impact. His children stayed in Brazil, so that was quite difficult for him. We had to build a relationship with him where, bit by bit, you start to talk more about the family.\u201d</p> <p>Football was Wesley\u2019s salvation. After spending much of his childhood playing futsal, he travelled all over Europe trying to earn a contract, spending three months with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s under-17 team and scoring twice for them in an international youth tournament in Spain, only to end up back in Brazil working on a production line.</p> <p>Wesley needed a break and that moment came when a highlights reel was sent to Trencin, who offered a one-month trial. Wesley saw himself as an attacking midfielder, but the Slovakian club looked at his power and pace and had other ideas. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to play like a No 9. He wanted to play in the middle. But all his talent that he had was really to be a striker,\u201d Rybnicek says. \u201cWe started to work on it and to give him this trust that in the future this would make him a really good player for the international market. Slowly he started to believe and the development was incredible.\u201d</p> <p>Although that plan worked out well and Wesley was soon transferred to Brugge, he still had a lot to learn on and off the pitch, right down to the importance of getting enough sleep and eating properly when he was away from the club. \u201cWe went with him to the supermarket to buy exactly what he needed,\u201d Rigaux adds.</p> <p>Rigaux talks with a lot of fondness about Wesley, praising him in particular for the way that he was always receptive to the club\u2019s advice, yet there were also moments when Brugge had to get \u201ctough\u201d with their young striker. Callow, desperate to prove himself and a little impetuous, Wesley became an easy target for defenders who saw a weakness in his temperament.</p> <p>\u201cYou see the beginning of his period in Brugge, he had some red cards for non-mature behaviour. Then I was very hard with him,\u201d Rigaux says.</p> <p>\u201cFirst of all you show a kind of comprehension to his behaviour because you know that he gets a lot of kicks, but you need to explain very clearly that it\u2019s absolutely not the way, because they knew that he reacted when they provoked him. We said to him: \u2018Be smarter with your body language, try to change it. If you show to a defender that you get irritated, he will only do it more. When they kick you, take three seconds to think and not react.\u2019 And, of course, it happened a few times that he fell in the trap again.\u201d</p> <p>Wesley needed to refine areas of his game too, notably his heading, but everyone could see his potential. Futsal had helped to hone his technical skills and then there was his towering physical presence and explosive speed. At 6ft 3in and 93kg (14st 9lb), he could dominate opponents. \u201cHe killed other players because he\u2019s such a big guy,\u201d Claudemir de Souza, a Brazilian who played alongside Wesley for Brugge, says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><strong>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</strong></figcaption> </figure>  <p>Claudemir lived next door to Wesley in Belgium and, as someone who is nearly 10 years older, tried to guide him. \u201cWe know it\u2019s hard when you lose your father when you\u2019re so young,\u201d Claudemir adds. \u201cHis mother always supported him, she would come to Belgium and I think she will come to England.

A package of reforms published for consultation includes proposals to stop no-fault evictions, which the charity Shelter has described as \u201cfar and away the most important thing the government can do\u201d to help renters. The communities secretary, James Brokenshire, announced plans on Sunday to allow public access to the register of the worst landlords, which is currently open only to local authorities. The move comes after an investigation by the Guardian and ITV News last year found that the database\u2019s contents would be kept secret from the public, prompting a government U-turn and pledge from the prime minister, Theresa May, to open the register. Tenants will be able to to look up their landlords and letting agents by name on the database to check their track records, with blacklisting possible for sex and drugs offences as well as failing to provide proper accommodation. However, only a tiny fraction of an estimated 10,500 rogue landlords operating in Britain have so far made it on to the database, which went live in April 2018. Freedom of information requests submitted by the Guardian earlier this year found that only four landlords had been added, by three councils. The government has said the list will grow and that it expects about 600 of the worst landlords to be added in time, once prosecutions for offences have been completed. Brokenshire said: \u201cThis database has the potential to ensure that poor-quality homes across the country are improved and the worst landlords are banned, and it is right that we unlock this crucial information for new and prospective tenants. \u201cLandlords should be in no doubt that they must provide decent homes or face the consequences.\u201d Responding to the announcement, Shelter\u2019s chief executive, Polly Neate, said the database \u201cwill offer renters a better chance of protecting themselves and their family\u201d. Generation Rent\u2019s director, Dan Wilson Craw, said it was \u201canother victory for renters\u201d but he warned that it would need \u201cmuch more effective enforcement to identify all landlords who have been breaking the law\u201d. There are more than 11 million private renters in England across 4.5m households, according to English Housing Survey figures, and the percentage has doubled since 2002 from 10% to 19%. Campaigners also welcomed progress towards abolishing no-fault evictions, in which landlords can force tenants to leave by simply issuing a form called a section 21 notice. Wilson Craw said: \u201cAbolishing section 21 is a central task for any government that wants to make renting work for the millions of people who have no other option for the foreseeable future.\u201d Landlords would be given grounds to reclaim properties when they genuinely need them, such as to sell the home or for a member of their family to move in. A 12-week consultation has started on the proposed reforms. It came as the National Housing Federation reported that for every social house built in England, eight families are accepted as homeless by their local council. Kate Henderson, the federation\u2019s chief executive, said the \u201cshocking disparity \u2026 puts into stark perspective how far away we are from meeting our housing need\u201d.",

From their vantage point on gym floors across the country, they see our grunting, sweating exertion up close: the peacocking bros, the men who don\u2019t wipe down the machines when they are done \u2013 and that woman on the treadmill who is never off her phone. But what common mistakes do they witness, day after day? Which fitness myths really wind them up? And can they answer the burning exercise-related question of our times: is Noel Edmonds <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jun/01/noel-edmonds-bank-mr-blobby-barmy-reputation\" title=\"\">right to claim that</a> stretching is a con invented by personal trainers?</p> <h2><strong>In the land of the gym machines, technique is king</strong></h2> <p>The No 1 gripe from all the personal trainers I spoke to was the same: poor technique \u2013 not lifting weights correctly, leaning forwards into your squat, or busting out the repetitions, but with the incorrect posture and form. Not only does bad technique risk causing injury, but it is often pointless exertion: your body won\u2019t reap any benefits.</p> <p>Learn to do things properly, and then slow down. \u201cI\u2019d rather people did two repetitions of a full push-up than 10 repetitions on their knees,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jermainejohnsonpt/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Jermaine Johnson</a>, a personal trainer with the gym chain Blok. \u201cThey\u2019re going to shock their muscles and increase their strength. The body adapts to movement patterns, so the more you do it, the better you\u2019re going to get. I wish people knew that, and worked for quality over quantity.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Fitness classes can be great \u2013 but tread with caution</strong></h2> <p>When it comes to poor form, part of the problem may be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/31/gym-new-nightclub-party-workouts-sweat-crawls-friends\" title=\"\">our growing fondness for fitness classes</a>. Although classes can be a great way to get into exercise \u2013 and more motivating than working out on your own \u2013 often, instructors don\u2019t demonstrate the exercises for more than a few seconds.</p> <p>If you are a newbie, it is easy to get things wrong. \u201cIf you\u2019re a beginner in a class and you\u2019re doing a deadlift with the wrong technique, you\u2019re going to be in bed for three days with a sore back,\u201d says the personal trainer <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bradleysimmonds/?utm_source=ig_embed\" title=\"\">Bradley Simmonds</a>. He advises beginners to arrive before classes start, and pull the instructors aside for a chat. \u201cAsk your instructor: \u2018Can you show me the proper technique?\u2019 \u2013 and then you\u2019re good to go.\u201d</p> <h2>Women, lifting weights won\u2019t turn you into Hulk Hogan</h2> <p>Of all the myths that persist around exercise, this is one of the most damaging, as it excludes women from the health benefits of strength training. Lifting weights will help you to <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/how-to-improve-strength-flexibility/\" title=\"\">stay strong and active into old age</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743501909090\" title=\"\">can reduce your likelihood</a> of having back pain or bone fractures in later life. But many women still avoid the free-weights section because they are concerned that the odd bicep curl will turn them into Hulk Hogan. \u201cI want more women to know that weights won\u2019t bulk them,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to assume that, after a few weight sessions, you\u2019re going to wake up looking like a bodybuilder. It takes a very long time to build up muscle.\u201d</p> <p>Don\u2019t feel nervous about venturing into the weights sections. \u201cFor women, or people from the LGBTQ community, it can be scary even to walk into the section of the gym that has all the weights in it for the first time,\u201d says Melanie Stride, a <a href=\"http://strengthambassadors.com/about/our-team/#mel\" title=\"\">personal </a><a href=\"http://strengthambassadors.com/about/our-team/#mel\" title=\"\">trainer and lifting specialist</a>. She encourages women to educate themselves about the benefits of strength training, and get lifting. \u201cLifting culture has been seen as very male, very straight and very young. One of the biggest things I do is reassure people outside of those groups that they can do this, in an environment where they feel safe, accepted and part of a community.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c67a43c0ad4368ce2e54eecbd5337598c4a31a87\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c67a43c0ad4368ce2e54eecbd5337598c4a31a87/0_0_1193_1122/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woman on treadmill on mobile phone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"940\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong>You may not be trying hard enough</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI have a friend who used to go to the gym and sit on the bike and watch Diagnosis: Murder,\u201d says Sarah Overall, a <a href=\"https://overallfit.co.uk/\" title=\"\">fitness and nutrition expert</a>. \u201cIf you can concentrate on that, you probably need to do a bit more work.\u201d How do you know if you\u2019re working hard enough? \u201cYou need to get yourself to a point where you\u2019re feeling breathless, and you can answer questions, but you can\u2019t have a whole conversation,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The odd jog isn\u2019t enough. <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/\" title=\"\">The NHS advises</a> adults aged 19 to 64 to do 150 minutes of moderate activity a week, in addition to twice-weekly strength exercises, to stay healthy. \u201cJust having a little stroll around the park isn\u2019t going to do it,\u201d Overall says.</p> <p>Push yourself. Are you doing as many burpees as you possibly can during your regular HIIT (high-intensity interval training) class? Working to failure \u2013 meaning that you exercise to the point of exhaustion \u2013 will take your body to the next level, says Johnson. \u201cIf you feel a set was easy, find the point where you\u2019re working to failure \u2013 that\u2019s when you know your body is working.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>You don\u2019t need </strong><strong>fancy gear or </strong><strong>boutique-gym membership</strong></h2> <p>Don\u2019t be fooled by the yoga bunnies wearing expensive brands on Instagram: you don\u2019t need sweat-wicking fibres or seamless running tights to exercise. A T-shirt, a supportive sports bra (if you are female) and a pair of leggings or shorts will be fine. What you shouldn\u2019t skimp on, says Overall, are decent trainers. \u201cGo to a specialist shop, walk on a treadmill so they can look at your gait, and make sure the shoes fit you properly. If you\u2019re not wearing the correct footwear, that can cause injury.\u201d</p> <p>Even if you cannot afford to join a gym, there is no reason not to get moving. \u201cIf you have space in your house or garden, or in a nearby park, that\u2019s all you need,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hannahlewin_/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Hannah Lewin</a>, a personal trainer who works exclusively with women. She points to all the fitness content available on YouTube or Instagram, as well as free apps such as <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/couch-to-5k-week-by-week/\" title=\"\">Couch to 5K</a>, or Virgin\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.virginmoneylondonmarathon.com/en-gb/trainingplans/\" title=\"\">free marathon training plans</a>. If you can afford to join a gym, there is usually a personal trainer on the floor who will demonstrate the basic exercises.</p> <h2><strong>Leave </strong><strong>your ego in the locker-room</strong></h2> <p>You know the type \u2013 an ego lifter struts about the weights section, loudly grunting as they grapple with the biggest weight they can manage. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be the ego lifters,\u201d says the personal trainer and disability specialist <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/movmfitness/\" title=\"\">Rob Ghahremani</a>. \u201cEvery gym has one. We\u2019ve got an idiot in ours who sprays chalk absolutely everywhere. For the bench press, he\u2019ll load the bar up with 150 kilos and move the weight about as far as I can walk \u2013 which isn\u2019t very far.\u201d (Ghahremani uses a wheelchair.)</p> <p>Not only are ego lifters annoying, but they may be causing themselves damage. \u201cTheir technique is often really bad,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cBecause they want to look and feel as if they\u2019re working hard, they put maximum stress not only on their muscles, but on their whole body and joints.\u201d It\u2019s also unnecessary: heavier weights aren\u2019t always best. \u201cYou can train with a lighter weight and slow down the tempo, focus on your range of movement, and you\u2019ll feel it more than doing bad reps with a heavy weight.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e67ddc1c12353b7349c31e0c18821afa1fba5803\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e67ddc1c12353b7349c31e0c18821afa1fba5803/0_0_579_1122/516.jpg\" alt=\"Man at gym\" width=\"516\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Find your real motivation</h2> <p>In gyms, as in life, it is a good idea to ask yourself: what am I doing here? \u201cEveryone should be able to have their own goals for their body,\u201d says Stride. \u201cIf you want to get really lean and shredded, I\u2019m not going to cast judgment on that goal. But there are so many other reasons to exercise, whether it\u2019s for your physical or psychological health.\u201d</p> <p>Overall believes you should train for the body you have, not the body you think you should have. \u201cYou can\u2019t really change your basic shape,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you\u2019re a natural pear shape, you are always going to be a pear shape. You can reduce your body fat, to make yourself look smaller, but your bottom will still be in the same proportion to your top.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Be realistic about what exercise alone can achieve</strong></h2> <p>If you want to lose weight, exercise isn\u2019t enough \u2013 you also need to look at diet. <a href=\"https://europepmc.org/abstract/med/21178922\" title=\"\">We tend to overestimate</a> the calories we burn in the gym; it is the reason <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2015/10/on-the-mysteries-of-marathon-weight-gain.html\" title=\"\">female marathon runners</a> often gain weight while training. Simmonds points out that many people work really hard in the gym, but then think they can eat what they like: \u201cThey give 100% effort, and then ruin it by having a massive meal.\u201d</p> <p>Don\u2019t just smash the cardio. \u201cThrowing yourself into the weights room is where you\u2019re going to get the most effective results,\u201d says Johnson. And if the number on the scales stays the same, don\u2019t be disheartened. \u201cClients sometimes complain they haven\u2019t lost weight, but they\u2019ve actually lost fat and replaced it with muscle.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Gels and protein powders are best left to the professionals</strong></h2> <p>Beware the siren call of expensive energy drinks and gels. \u201cUnless you\u2019re doing more than 90 minutes of endurance work, you do not need an energy drink,\u201d says Overall. The same goes for protein powders, unless you are actively bodybuilding.</p> <p>Reject the guff and nonsense of diet culture. \u201cI work on an anti-diet basis,\u201d says Lewin. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I am anti-fat loss, if that\u2019s what you want. But I\u2019m anti-nonsense-products, such as fad teas, tablets and raspberry ketones \u2013 anything that makes a profit, rather than promoting long-term health.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Don\u2019t do the same thing week-in, week-out</strong></h2> <p>When it comes to fitness, routine is the enemy of progress. \u201cThe body responds to progressive overload,\u201d says Stride, \u201cso unless you progressively overload a movement, you\u2019re never going to move forward. If you don\u2019t ever increase your weights, and you carry on doing the same sets, week in, week out, you\u2019ll maintain your fitness, but you won\u2019t make progress.\u201d</p> <p>To get the best out of exercise, you need to do a mixture of cardio, strength and flexibility work. \u201cCardio is going to make you live longer, and make your heart more efficient,\u201d says Ghahremani. \u201cWeight training will strengthen your muscles and lead to stable muscle growth. And flexibility work will stop you putting your back out getting out of bed in the morning. All three are equally important to a good, long, healthy life.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Go at your own pace, and don\u2019t be afraid </strong></h2> <p>If you have the money to hire a personal trainer, be upfront with them about your fears. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to work out until you\u2019re sick, you should never be in a position where you have to do that,\u201d says Overall. \u201cBe honest \u2013 if you\u2019re really scared and think this is going to half-kill you, share that with the person training you.\u201d</p> <p>Disabled people shouldn\u2019t underestimate how much they can do. \u201cOften, they tell themselves they can\u2019t do certain things,\u201d Ghahremani observes, \u201cand they place more limits on themselves than they should. Boundaries can be pushed! You\u2019ve just got to be a bit creative about it.\u201d</p> <p>If you are older and have health problems, speak to your GP before throwing yourself into fitness, advises <a href=\"http://buddyactive.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Richard Miller,</a> who specialises in training the over-50s. Look at the capabilities of your body, and find exercise that works for you. \u201cA lot of the guys I see have knackered knees; cycling is low-impact, and even better is swimming, which is great body conditioning, but also low impact for people with joint or knee issues.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Don\u2019t listen to Noel Edmond</strong><strong>s</strong></h2> <p>Finally, the most urgent fitness question of all: is stretching really a scam invented by personal trainers? Lewin certainly doesn\u2019t think so. \u201cAlthough sometimes overlooked, stretching has many benefits,\u201d she says, \u201cincluding increasing flexibility and range of motion and improving posture.\u201d She advises that you incorporate stretching into your warm-up and cool-down routines, to help the body prepare for movement and recover after a workout.</p> <p>Stride agrees that stretching can be useful, but only if you are doing it right: waving your arms about while standing stock-still isn\u2019t going to do much. \u201cStatic stretching is rarely necessary or an effective use of exercise time for the majority of clients,\u201d she says. \u201cInstead, dynamic (moving) stretches are a great way to warm up, with static holds used only sparingly to access some additional range of motion prior to training.\u201d</p> <p>The verdict is in, then: stretching is not a scam. But, as Edmonds might observe, they would say that, wouldn\u2019t they?</p>",

If you\u2019re not wearing the correct footwear, that can cause injury.\u201d Even if you cannot afford to join a gym, there is no reason not to get moving. \u201cIf you have space in your house or garden, or in a nearby park, that\u2019s all you need,\u201d says Hannah Lewin, a personal trainer who works exclusively with women. She points to all the fitness content available on YouTube or Instagram, as well as free apps such as Couch to 5K, or Virgin\u2019s free marathon training plans. If you can afford to join a gym, there is usually a personal trainer on the floor who will demonstrate the basic exercises. Leave your ego in the locker-room You know the type \u2013 an ego lifter struts about the weights section, loudly grunting as they grapple with the biggest weight they can manage. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be the ego lifters,\u201d says the personal trainer and disability specialist Rob Ghahremani. \u201cEvery gym has one. We\u2019ve got an idiot in ours who sprays chalk absolutely everywhere. For the bench press, he\u2019ll load the bar up with 150 kilos and move the weight about as far as I can walk \u2013 which isn\u2019t very far.\u201d (Ghahremani uses a wheelchair.) Not only are ego lifters annoying, but they may be causing themselves damage. \u201cTheir technique is often really bad,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cBecause they want to look and feel as if they\u2019re working hard, they put maximum stress not only on their muscles, but on their whole body and joints.\u201d It\u2019s also unnecessary: heavier weights aren\u2019t always best. \u201cYou can train with a lighter weight and slow down the tempo, focus on your range of movement, and you\u2019ll feel it more than doing bad reps with a heavy weight.\u201d Find your real motivation In gyms, as in life, it is a good idea to ask yourself: what am I doing here? \u201cEveryone should be able to have their own goals for their body,\u201d says Stride. \u201cIf you want to get really lean and shredded, I\u2019m not going to cast judgment on that goal. But there are so many other reasons to exercise, whether it\u2019s for your physical or psychological health.\u201d Overall believes you should train for the body you have, not the body you think you should have. \u201cYou can\u2019t really change your basic shape,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you\u2019re a natural pear shape, you are always going to be a pear shape. You can reduce your body fat, to make yourself look smaller, but your bottom will still be in the same proportion to your top.\u201d Be realistic about what exercise alone can achieve If you want to lose weight, exercise isn\u2019t enough \u2013 you also need to look at diet. We tend to overestimate the calories we burn in the gym; it is the reason female marathon runners often gain weight while training. Simmonds points out that many people work really hard in the gym, but then think they can eat what they like: \u201cThey give 100% effort, and then ruin it by having a massive meal.\u201d Don\u2019t just smash the cardio. \u201cThrowing yourself into the weights room is where you\u2019re going to get the most effective results,\u201d says Johnson. And if the number on the scales stays the same, don\u2019t be disheartened. \u201cClients sometimes complain they haven\u2019t lost weight, but they\u2019ve actually lost fat and replaced it with muscle.\u201d Gels and protein powders are best left to the professionals Beware the siren call of expensive energy drinks and gels. \u201cUnless you\u2019re doing more than 90 minutes of endurance work, you do not need an energy drink,\u201d says Overall. The same goes for protein powders, unless you are actively bodybuilding. Reject the guff and nonsense of diet culture. \u201cI work on an anti-diet basis,\u201d says Lewin. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I am anti-fat loss, if that\u2019s what you want. But I\u2019m anti-nonsense-products, such as fad teas, tablets and raspberry ketones \u2013 anything that makes a profit, rather than promoting long-term health.\u201d Don\u2019t do the same thing week-in, week-out When it comes to fitness, routine is the enemy of progress. \u201cThe body responds to progressive overload,\u201d says Stride, \u201cso unless you progressively overload a movement, you\u2019re never going to move forward. If you don\u2019t ever increase your weights, and you carry on doing the same sets, week in, week out, you\u2019ll maintain your fitness, but you won\u2019t make progress.\u201d To get the best out of exercise, you need to do a mixture of cardio, strength and flexibility work. \u201cCardio is going to make you live longer, and make your heart more efficient,\u201d says Ghahremani. \u201cWeight training will strengthen your muscles and lead to stable muscle growth. And flexibility work will stop you putting your back out getting out of bed in the morning. All three are equally important to a good, long, healthy life.\u201d Go at your own pace, and don\u2019t be afraid If you have the money to hire a personal trainer, be upfront with them about your fears. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to work out until you\u2019re sick, you should never be in a position where you have to do that,\u201d says Overall. \u201cBe honest \u2013 if you\u2019re really scared and think this is going to half-kill you, share that with the person training you.\u201d Disabled people shouldn\u2019t underestimate how much they can do. \u201cOften, they tell themselves they can\u2019t do certain things,\u201d Ghahremani observes, \u201cand they place more limits on themselves than they should. Boundaries can be pushed! You\u2019ve just got to be a bit creative about it.\u201d If you are older and have health problems, speak to your GP before throwing yourself into fitness, advises Richard Miller, who specialises in training the over-50s. Look at the capabilities of your body, and find exercise that works for you. \u201cA lot of the guys I see have knackered knees; cycling is low-impact, and even better is swimming, which is great body conditioning, but also low impact for people with joint or knee issues.\u201d Don\u2019t listen to Noel Edmonds Finally, the most urgent fitness question of all: is stretching really a scam invented by personal trainers? Lewin certainly doesn\u2019t think so. \u201cAlthough sometimes overlooked, stretching has many benefits,\u201d she says, \u201cincluding increasing flexibility and range of motion and improving posture.\u201d She advises that you incorporate stretching into your warm-up and cool-down routines, to help the body prepare for movement and recover after a workout. Stride agrees that stretching can be useful, but only if you are doing it right: waving your arms about while standing stock-still isn\u2019t going to do much. \u201cStatic stretching is rarely necessary or an effective use of exercise time for the majority of clients,\u201d she says. \u201cInstead, dynamic (moving) stretches are a great way to warm up, with static holds used only sparingly to access some additional range of motion prior to training.\u201d The verdict is in, then: stretching is not a scam. But, as Edmonds might observe, they would say that, wouldn\u2019t they?",

Take your odious Jew-hatred elsewhere and do not think for one second that your views help champion Palestinian rights. Never has it been more critical to talk about the political and economic state of Palestine. The two-state solution is at best in stasis, at worst it is teetering on the brink of a precipice. It needs a lifeline. And we can make a difference if our government lives up to the moral and historical responsibilities that Britain has been renowned for. \u2022 Layla Moran is Liberal Democrat MP for Oxford West and Abingdon",

      "bodyText": "Philip Hammond has confirmed he will resign as chancellor if Boris Johnson becomes prime minister next week, as the scale of opposition to a no-deal Brexit among some ministers became increasingly plain. Shortly before the chancellor made his announcement, live on BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show, the justice secretary, David Gauke, made the same pledge to a newspaper. Tobias Ellwood, the defence minister, also warned that leaving the EU without a deal was not the answer. Hammond and Gauke were among a number of ministers who defied government whips last week to abstain on a backbench motion that would make it much harder for Johnson to suspend parliament and thus stop MPs from blocking no deal. Asked by Marr if he expected to be sacked soon, Hammond said: \u201cNo, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not going to be sacked because I\u2019m going to resign before we get to that point. Assuming that Boris Johnson becomes the next prime minister, I understand that his conditions for serving in his government would include accepting a no-deal exit on 31 October and that\u2019s not something that I could ever sign up to. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that the prime minister is able to have a chancellor who is closely aligned with him in terms of policy and I therefore intend to resign to Theresa May before she goes to the palace to tender her own resignation on Wednesday.\u201d Conceding that such an announcement on live TV was \u201ca first\u201d, Hammond said he would still be on the frontbench for May\u2019s last outing at prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday. \u201cI intend to resign after prime minister\u2019s questions, before the prime minister goes to the palace,\u201d he said. Asked if he would also resign if Jeremy Hunt won, Hammond said: \u201cThat might be more complicated, because Jeremy\u2019s position is more nuanced, and I haven\u2019t heard him express clearly a requirement for a sort of loyalty pledge around a 31 October no-deal exit.\u201d Hammond denied he would be a focus of continued rebellion against Johnson, saying his only aim would be to stop a Johnson government forcing through no deal without the explicit consent of MPs, for example by proroguing parliament. \u201cThis is a parliamentary democracy, and if the new prime minister can persuade parliament to vote for a no-deal exit then I will have to accept that,\u201d Hammond said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t have wheezes like suspending parliament or proroguing parliament in order to deny parliament its voice.\u201d Other than no deal, Hammond said, he held no particular issue with Johnson: \u201cIt\u2019s nothing personal. I\u2019ve always got on very well with Boris. I find him a very engaging character and actually, beyond the Brexit question, I don\u2019t have have major policy disagreements with him.\u201d He declined to say whether he might support a vote of no confidence against a Johnson government to block leaving without a deal, saying only: \u201cI don\u2019t think it will get to that.\u201d Hammond said: \u201cI am confident that parliament does have a way of preventing a no-deal exit on 31 October without parliamentary consent and I intend to work with others to ensure parliament uses its power to make sure that the new government can\u2019t do that.\u201d Earlier, Gauke told the Sunday Times he would not be able to serve under Johnson if he pursued a no-deal Brexit: \u201cGiven that I\u2019ve been in the cabinet since Theresa May came to power, I think the appropriate thing is for me to resign.\u201d He added: \u201cIf the test of loyalty to stay in the cabinet is a commitment to support no deal on 31 October \u2013 which, to be fair to him, Boris has consistently said \u2013 then that\u2019s not something I\u2019m prepared to sign up to.\u201d Speaking on Sky\u2019s Sophie Ridge on Sunday programme, Ellwood did not specify whether he would refuse to serve under Johnson, but made plain his opposition to no deal, calling focus on it a distraction. \u201cThe fact that we keep talking about no deal fuels the small caucus of people that see that as their destination,\u201d Ellwood said. \u201cNo deal is not a destination.

      "bodyText": "\u201cYou must keep hold of your friendships, Lissa. The women. They\u2019re the only thing that will save you in the end.\u201d Such is the advice a mother gives her daughter in Anna Hope\u2019s profoundly intelligent and humane third novel, Expectation, about the disjunct between the lives we once imagined for ourselves and the lives we end up living. Cate is ravaged by new motherhood: both by sleep deprivation and the weight of maternal expectation. Subjected to the interference of an overbearing mother-in-law and the relentless demands of a young baby, her relationship with her partner, Sam, is increasingly distant: \u201cThis is the pattern of their evenings. A little passive-aggressive banter and then separate computers on separate chairs.\u201d Cate\u2019s childhood friend, Hannah, is the deputy director of a charity and married to a university lecturer, Nathan. They live a comfortable London life and yet for all her external successes, Hannah is desperately unhappy because of her inability to conceive despite repeated rounds of IVF. Completing the trio of friends is failing actress Lissa, whose disappointment about the way her life has turned out runs deep: \u201cShe is the sum total only of her failures. She could float up over these people\u2026 this city that she has loved, but which does not love her back, which does not give her what she needs to live, only to survive.\u201d Through each of these characters, Hope explores what it means to be female in the 21st century and the various causes of our thwarted expectations.

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.</p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europeif there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He said: \u201cJust because there\u2019s a change in personality as British prime minister doesn\u2019t mean that the negotiation of the last three years and the solutions that were designed by the British government as much as by the EU aren\u2019t still as relevant and important today as they were six or eight weeks ago.\u201d</p> \n<p>While the Sunday Times <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/stop-no-deal-secret-eu-drive-to-woo-boris-johnson-into-compromise-l8mcq5nzw?ni-statuscode=acsaz-307\">has claimed</a> Ireland and other EU nations could be willing to give way to a Johnson government to avoid no deal, Coveney said major <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/16/eu-reject-outright-boris-johnson-jeremy-hunt-backstop\">changes to the backstop</a> \u2013 the insurance policy to avoid a hard Irish border if no other solution can be found \u2013 such as adding a time limit, were simply impossible.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve always said no to that,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a context around this. You have to be able to answer the question, if asked, of what happens at the end of that time limit. And if you can\u2019t answer that question then it\u2019s not a backstop at all.\u201d</p> \n<p>The backstop, Coveney said, was \u201cabout reassuring people in Northern Ireland that they are not going to go back to the friction and tensions of the past\u201d.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cTo ask Ireland to compromise on that core issue, when we spent two and a half years working with the British government and the EU to try and find a way to compromise on all sides to ensure that we don\u2019t face that prospect, it is not a reasonable ask, because of a political challenge in Westminster, to move away from that position.\u201d</p> \n<p>Coveney said he understood only too well what the consequences for Ireland and Northern Ireland would be of no deal, but said this would entirely be down to UK government choices.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is not where we are now. If the House of Commons chooses to facilitate a no-deal Brexit, and if a new British prime minister chooses to take Britain in that direction, then it will happen. But this will be a British choice. Not an Irish choice, not an EU choice \u2013 this is a British choice,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>He said everyone wanted to avoid no deal, having worked for three years to do that. \u201cI have done little else in politics apart from focus on the choice of the British people to leave the European Union and its impact on Ireland and the EU,\u201d he added.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe want to try to resolve these issues, but we won\u2019t do it on the basis of being told what must happen because that is the only thing that will pass in the House of Commons.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd international negotiation needs to involve compromise on both sides. We have a deal that has involved compromise on both sides, to facilitate, let\u2019s not forget, British red lines throughout this process. And a new British prime minister doesn\u2019t change that.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the event of no deal there would be some sort of checks on goods away from the border, Coveney said, to protect Ireland\u2019s place in the EU single market. He added: \u201cWhat I mean is, we cannot allow an open back door into the EU single market through Northern Ireland. If we do then the Republic of Ireland would be taken out of the single market as well, and I can\u2019t allow that.\u201d</p>",

He said: \u201cTo ask Ireland to compromise on that core issue, when we spent two and a half years working with the British government and the EU to try and find a way to compromise on all sides to ensure that we don\u2019t face that prospect, it is not a reasonable ask, because of a political challenge in Westminster, to move away from that position.\u201d Coveney said he understood only too well what the consequences for Ireland and Northern Ireland would be of no deal, but said this would entirely be down to UK government choices. \u201cIt is not where we are now. If the House of Commons chooses to facilitate a no-deal Brexit, and if a new British prime minister chooses to take Britain in that direction, then it will happen. But this will be a British choice. Not an Irish choice, not an EU choice \u2013 this is a British choice,\u201d he said. He said everyone wanted to avoid no deal, having worked for three years to do that. \u201cI have done little else in politics apart from focus on the choice of the British people to leave the European Union and its impact on Ireland and the EU,\u201d he added. \u201cWe want to try to resolve these issues, but we won\u2019t do it on the basis of being told what must happen because that is the only thing that will pass in the House of Commons. \u201cAnd international negotiation needs to involve compromise on both sides. We have a deal that has involved compromise on both sides, to facilitate, let\u2019s not forget, British red lines throughout this process. And a new British prime minister doesn\u2019t change that.\u201d In the event of no deal there would be some sort of checks on goods away from the border, Coveney said, to protect Ireland\u2019s place in the EU single market. He added: \u201cWhat I mean is, we cannot allow an open back door into the EU single market through Northern Ireland. If we do then the Republic of Ireland would be taken out of the single market as well, and I can\u2019t allow that.\u201d",

She recently switched from 400m to hurdles</em></p> <p>I don\u2019t come from a sporty family at all. My mum was raised in rural Egypt, where sport wasn\u2019t on the radar, but I\u2019m thankful because I\u2019ve seen parents walk away from their child if they\u2019ve not won a race. Even when I came last in the European juniors mum said: \u201cBut 54.7 is a good time!\u201d</p> <p>As my twin sister Laviai lived in an Olympic borough, we volunteered at the 2012 games, and we saw what elite sport was like up close. I carried Jess Ennis\u2019s kit bag on to the track for her 200m final. The scream when she walked out was unbelievable. We\u2019d seen her picture plastered all over billboards, but she was right there. We thought, \u201cIf she\u2019s done this, why can\u2019t we?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I carried Jess Ennis\u2019s kit bag for her 200m final in 2012. We thought, 'If she\u2019s done this, why can\u2019t we?'</p> <footer> <cite>Lina Nielsen</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Up until then, we just loved PE. We had a track painted on the astroturf at our school playground and we would set ourselves challenges, like how many laps we could do in a lunchbreak. We\u2019d do the mini-marathon and school competitions, but after the Olympics, we decided to see how far we could go if we trained properly.</p> <p>In 2015 we both made the European junior championships and won gold in the 4x400m relay. It was the last event of the day so the whole GB squad was cheering us on. I remember exactly how loud the screams were \u2013 I can hear them in my head now. We got signed by Adidas and we were suddenly considered professional athletes. The year before that I was ranked 100th in the country, I was nowhere to be seen, and overnight I was ranked third in Europe. It was crazy.</p> <p>It hasn\u2019t been easy, though. At the European juniors, we also both reached the 400m final, but I got a cold that day, so although I was ranked third I came eighth. I was heartbroken, but my sister won so I was saying to myself, \u201cDon\u2019t cry don\u2019t cry don\u2019t cry.\u201d Then two years ago we made the European indoors, but I had to pull out with a grade two stress response in my fibula and she got to the finals. In a way it helps me because there\u2019s somebody to support. It also gives me confidence because we\u2019re identical, we\u2019re carbon copies of each other so if she\u2019s achieved it, my time will come.</p> <p>After those championships I looked for inspiration and found that Jessica Ennis had an injury before the 2008 games. I decided it was a rite of passage, and gave me a chance to step back and work on the basics. I decided to run the hurdles, and after one race I was ranked higher than I was in 400m. Suddenly I was enjoying sport again.I train five days a week. I do a long warm-up, then either accelerations, speed running or endurance, then we do strength and conditioning, and of course hurdles sessions, too. There are so many things that you have to maintain; your nutrition has to be on point, your recovery, your mindset. It\u2019s not just about the three or four hours on the track, every decision you make affects your chances.</p> <p>I have to sacrifice a social life. My friends want to go and party until 2am, but I can only make it to 9pm, because I have training in the morning. I also feel like I never really experienced uni. Wednesdays were the partying night, but I trained on Wednesday evenings, I was never part of any societies because I never had any time. I sacrificed part of that teenagehood, but I don\u2019t regret any of it. To stand on top of a podium is a special thing, because it\u2019s so rare. I so want to do it in Tokyo.</p> <h2>The diver: Kyle Kothari</h2> <p><em>Kyle, 21,</em><em> dives individually and alongside team-mate Matty Lee from the 10m board</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cdd1145f64b482fe9c845e17ce9348f07ef01fd5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdd1145f64b482fe9c845e17ce9348f07ef01fd5/104_819_3651_4563/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We\u2019ve got five guys fighting for two spots, and Tom Daley obviously will get one, so four of us are left fighting for the second one\u2019: Kyle Kothari.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We\u2019ve got five guys fighting for two spots, and Tom Daley obviously will get one, so four of us are left fighting for the second one\u2019: Kyle Kothari.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Juan Trujillo Andrades/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was a hyperactive kid so, aged three, my parents took me to gymnastics to release some energy.

I stood there for about three minutes, swaying back and forth deciding whether to do it or not, but you do it so much it normalises it.I was soon training six days a week and after three years I got into the junior GB team, then in 2014 I was junior European champion and junior world bronze medalist.</p> <p>I had a really good chance of going to Rio, but I had nerve damage in my shoulder that was so serious it put me out for two years. In training I\u2019d get a searing pain from my shoulder right through to my fingertips, but I ignored it and carried on. After a while so much scar tissue had built up that I went to a competition and tried to swing my arm and it wouldn\u2019t move. I couldn\u2019t even raise my hand to brush my teeth. I rested it for six months, did one dive and the pain was back, so I had to have surgery.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In my time out injured I got a taste for normal life, chilling, not chucking myself off a board every day</p> <footer> <cite>Kyle Kothari</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I was out for two and a half years in total, and in that time I had to make a call between going into full-time education or focusing on sport.

I don\u2019t live the normal life of someone my age, but that\u2019s been the case for years.

It wasn\u2019t just the sport I loved, it was the way I felt when I was doing it. Being upside down and not knowing where you are was an adrenaline rush even at that age. Before I knew it, I was training six days a week.</p> <p>I was all set to go to Rio; I\u2019d won three golds and two silvers at the Europeans, I was at my peak, then everything changed. I was trying a new skill on the high bar; doing a double backflip with a full turn, but I couldn\u2019t catch the bar. It wasn\u2019t happening so I was getting annoyed. I pumped myself up and went for it and I caught the bar with my left hand, but my right missed so I swung round on one arm, shot off to the side and hit the wall with a straight leg. It snapped and I was in agony. It was so swollen I had to wait three months to have surgery. The injury was so severe, they had to take tendons from my good leg to make a ligament. my leg was in a brace for nine months and I had to learn to walk again.</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t even lift my own leg so I couldn\u2019t even imagine myself jumping, let alone getting back to being a world-class gymnast. I thought it was game over. I was away from the training environment, on bed rest watching TV so I got lazy, but Team GB took me out to Rio to watch. It was a long flight with my leg in a brace, so it flared up like a balloon, but I didn\u2019t care \u2013 I was going to watch the Olympics! That put the fire back in belly. I met a sports psychologist there and asked her for her help. Coming home all I could think was, \u201cGet me back in the gym.\u201d</p> <p>Learning to walk again was a huge battle. My leg shook with each tiny step because I\u2019d been in a brace for nearly nine months, so I had no quads, no calves, nothing. Once I got the confidence back walking \u2013 after nine months, I started increasing the speed, from there I did little jumps and I built up from there. To get mentally and physically well took a good two years.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My biggest fear is not making the team.

The fear is doing all of this, then not making it.</p> <p>My greatest achievement isn\u2019t a medal or a championship \u2013 it\u2019s coming back. At the World Cup in Tokyo in April I went up against the Japanese gymnast Kenzo Shirai \u2013 he\u2019s been world champion numerous times, and should have won at Rio but he made an error. I looked down at my scars and went for it. When my score came up I\u2019d beaten him. That was all I needed \u2013 I\u2019d beaten the best in the world.

My older brother Daniel was the first one to join the GB team, then Tre and now me. I learnt to ride a bike when I was two, started riding a BMX when I was three, then at four I started competing.</p> <p>When I was a little kid I had full-body eczema and really bad asthma, so I had to use these massive asthma pumps, but doctors said BMX would help, so I used to ride round until I couldn\u2019t breathe, take my inhaler then keep going. It was bad for my eczema \u2013 dusty and dry \u2013 but my mum kept on top of that.</p> <p>From the age of five to 13 I won 10 British championships. I got to the point where I would race up two age classes, so I would be eight racing 10-year-old boys and I was still winning, but when I got to aged 13 I had a massive accident. I knocked myself out for five days, I had a bleed on the brain, a broken jaw and I didn\u2019t ride for a year and a half. I was racing the older boys and someone crashed in front of me. I tried to move out of the way in midair, which is impossible, so I fell and knocked myself out.</p> <p>I don\u2019t really remember the accident, or much for months after it but I didn\u2019t go to school for months because my cheek was completely off \u2013 I needed a skin graft and I had to eat through a straw. I couldn\u2019t exercise, I was bedbound but I knew I wanted to get back on the bike, it was just a case of when and how.</p> <p>After 11 months I went back to the doctor and my brain looked fine, so I could ride again. That first session back I was training as hard as I could and constantly being sick, but nothing was going to stop me. It wasn\u2019t until I was 16 going on 17 that I started to get my confidence, my skills and my speed back \u2013 and got back on the GB team.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Whenever I crash I think, \u201cWhy do I do this?\u201d But then I still get on and go again</p> <footer> <cite>Kye Whyte</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One of my highest points was winning the World Cup in Manchester this year. The first day I was confident I could make the final and hopefully win it. I got to the semi-finals but then someone crashed in front of me and my day was done. I had a drop of confidence and the second day my starts weren\u2019t as good, but the one time I did get a good start was in the final, and it worked out. It was unbelievable to win.</p> <p>Getting to training is a daily challenge. In winter I just want to quit. I can\u2019t stand it. Trying to keep the motivation week in, week out is the worst because it\u2019s 10am until 5pm. We do track work, then bike work on the flat, sprints from a dead stop and gym work. Doing that nonstop with no competitions is draining. It gets you really strong and that gets you the outcome, which is where you get the motivation from, but it\u2019s relentless. This year, because of the Olympics, we started in February and we\u2019ll compete right the way up to October with no breaks.</p> <p>From the World Cup in September last year to next July every race counts for Olympic points \u2013 we get points as riders and for our country. If GB gets in the top two, three riders can go, if it\u2019s top five to three we get two riders and after that it\u2019s one rider. The goal is to get three but we only have five riders, while other countries have ten.</p> <p>When I\u2019m racing I have to keep composed, because you make the littlest mistake and the other riders will hunt you and catch you. You can crash at any time, and that crash can put you out for a year. Eight people are going over a massive jump at once, and it\u2019s a contact sport so you can take each other off. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jul/25/paralysed-olympic-bmx-rider-sam-willoughby-progresses-to-a-crawl\" title=\"\">Sam Willoughby</a> was one of the best ever, but he flipped off the bike and was paralysed.

I\u2019d put them in ballet classes. My kid would be girly as anything. I\u2019m in Sheffield Monday to Thursday, I get up at 6.30am, weigh myself, then I\u2019m on the track at 7am to run \u2013 and I hate running. I\u2019d rather get smacked in my face 10 times than run 100m. Then I either do pads or strength work, and then it\u2019s sparring. In London on Fridays I have longer sessions, and Saturday I either spa or run. Sometimes I think a nine to five would be easier \u2013 when you\u2019re at home you switch off, but with boxing it\u2019s 24/7.</p> <p>I grew up in Catford in southeast London. My brother boxed and I followed him like his little shadow. I begged him to take me to the gym, but eventually my cousin Jim gave in instead. I was a little fat kid and nobody was taking girls\u2019 boxing seriously then, so it faded out after about a year. My coach Colin kept saying, \u201cEllie, come back to the gym,\u201d and I would laugh and say, \u201cYeah yeah, I\u2019ll be back.\u201d Then when I was 16 he passed away and I felt like I owed it to him to go back. I walked in the gym at 75kg and Sam \u2013 my coach now \u2013 said \u201cEllie, you\u2019ve got to sort yourself out, look at you!\u201d I decided I was going to prove those idiots wrong, and six weeks later I\u2019d lost 15kg and everything flowed.</p> <p>When you walk into a gym as a girl, people don\u2019t necessarily give you the respect \u2013 they think girls\u2019 boxing is a cat fight, but once you start fighting they recognise you\u2019re not a girl boxer, you\u2019re a boxer. I had my first fight a week after my 17th birthday, then I won the youth ABAs with only four fights under my belt. I was offered a place on a GB programme, but I didn\u2019t want a golden ticket, I wanted to know I\u2019d earned my place so I said no and went straight into the senior ABAs without a senior fight, because they kept falling through. I won the senior ABAs at 19 and got on to the GB squad.</p> <p>Not long after that, though, I was out for 18 months because I broke my hand, and I was an idiot and carried on boxing. They had to get bone from my hip and put it in my hand with pins. I was a mess, mentally and physically. I was coming to the club constantly, just punching the bag with my right hand, running, skipping. I put all my frustrations on to everyone else, but that experience taught me to listen, so I\u2019m grateful for it now.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I run every morning \u2013 and I hate running.

She\u2019d got a European medal in that time, but I gave her a count in the first round and beat her. Then in the European final I boxed this girl who was about 8ft tall and her arms were down to her ankles, and I only went in at about 60% so to walk out with silver medal was incredible.</p> <p>I\u2019ve got to give it 100% not just in terms of how I\u2019m training, but how I\u2019m living, because everyone is world class. I\u2019ve never drunk alcohol, I obviously don\u2019t smoke and I\u2019ve never even set foot in a nightclub. I spent my 21st birthday in Russia without my family, but it was perfect because I got through to the finals of the Europeans. I miss out on family holidays and birthdays all the time. My friends say, \u201cEllie, you\u2019ve got to live a bit,\u201d but this is me living.</p> <p>Before a fight I always think, \u201cWhy am I doing this?\u201d In that moment, I hate boxing \u2013 it tests you so much. Before my first fight in the world championships I had Delhi belly so I knew if I took a body shot, it was going to be the end of me. I said to coach Dave Pocknell, \u201cI hate this bit Dave\u201d and he said, \u201cYou should love it because that ring is your home, go get in there.\u201d He\u2019s right \u2013 it\u2019s all in the mind.When I think about going to the Olympics it makes my belly turn over, but that ring in Tokyo is where I\u2019m meant to be. </p>",

      "bodyText": "The 400m hurdler: Lina Nielsen Lina, 23, grew up in east London. She recently switched from 400m to hurdles I don\u2019t come from a sporty family at all. My mum was raised in rural Egypt, where sport wasn\u2019t on the radar, but I\u2019m thankful because I\u2019ve seen parents walk away from their child if they\u2019ve not won a race. Even when I came last in the European juniors mum said: \u201cBut 54.7 is a good time!\u201d As my twin sister Laviai lived in an Olympic borough, we volunteered at the 2012 games, and we saw what elite sport was like up close. I carried Jess Ennis\u2019s kit bag on to the track for her 200m final. The scream when she walked out was unbelievable. We\u2019d seen her picture plastered all over billboards, but she was right there. We thought, \u201cIf she\u2019s done this, why can\u2019t we?\u201d Up until then, we just loved PE. We had a track painted on the astroturf at our school playground and we would set ourselves challenges, like how many laps we could do in a lunchbreak. We\u2019d do the mini-marathon and school competitions, but after the Olympics, we decided to see how far we could go if we trained properly. In 2015 we both made the European junior championships and won gold in the 4x400m relay. It was the last event of the day so the whole GB squad was cheering us on. I remember exactly how loud the screams were \u2013 I can hear them in my head now. We got signed by Adidas and we were suddenly considered professional athletes. The year before that I was ranked 100th in the country, I was nowhere to be seen, and overnight I was ranked third in Europe. It was crazy. It hasn\u2019t been easy, though. At the European juniors, we also both reached the 400m final, but I got a cold that day, so although I was ranked third I came eighth. I was heartbroken, but my sister won so I was saying to myself, \u201cDon\u2019t cry don\u2019t cry don\u2019t cry.\u201d Then two years ago we made the European indoors, but I had to pull out with a grade two stress response in my fibula and she got to the finals. In a way it helps me because there\u2019s somebody to support. It also gives me confidence because we\u2019re identical, we\u2019re carbon copies of each other so if she\u2019s achieved it, my time will come. After those championships I looked for inspiration and found that Jessica Ennis had an injury before the 2008 games. I decided it was a rite of passage, and gave me a chance to step back and work on the basics. I decided to run the hurdles, and after one race I was ranked higher than I was in 400m. Suddenly I was enjoying sport again.I train five days a week. I do a long warm-up, then either accelerations, speed running or endurance, then we do strength and conditioning, and of course hurdles sessions, too. There are so many things that you have to maintain; your nutrition has to be on point, your recovery, your mindset. It\u2019s not just about the three or four hours on the track, every decision you make affects your chances. I have to sacrifice a social life. My friends want to go and party until 2am, but I can only make it to 9pm, because I have training in the morning. I also feel like I never really experienced uni. Wednesdays were the partying night, but I trained on Wednesday evenings, I was never part of any societies because I never had any time. I sacrificed part of that teenagehood, but I don\u2019t regret any of it. To stand on top of a podium is a special thing, because it\u2019s so rare. I so want to do it in Tokyo. The diver: Kyle Kothari Kyle, 21, dives individually and alongside team-mate Matty Lee from the 10m board I was a hyperactive kid so, aged three, my parents took me to gymnastics to release some energy. The coaches saw me messing around and asked if I wanted to start on the squad. I did that for 12 years, and was ranked fourth in the country for my age at 12, but then I broke my elbow which put me out for six months, and I fell behind. Then in 2010, British Diving sent fliers around schools because they were talent-testing. Out of 70,000 kids they picked three boys \u2013 and I was one of them. I remember my first dive from the 10m board. I stood there for about three minutes, swaying back and forth deciding whether to do it or not, but you do it so much it normalises it.I was soon training six days a week and after three years I got into the junior GB team, then in 2014 I was junior European champion and junior world bronze medalist. I had a really good chance of going to Rio, but I had nerve damage in my shoulder that was so serious it put me out for two years. In training I\u2019d get a searing pain from my shoulder right through to my fingertips, but I ignored it and carried on. After a while so much scar tissue had built up that I went to a competition and tried to swing my arm and it wouldn\u2019t move. I couldn\u2019t even raise my hand to brush my teeth. I rested it for six months, did one dive and the pain was back, so I had to have surgery. I was out for two and a half years in total, and in that time I had to make a call between going into full-time education or focusing on sport. I\u2019ve ended up doing both \u2013 I\u2019m studying geography and economics at LSE. But in my time out I got a taste for normal life; chilling with friends and socialising, not having the stress of chucking myself off a board every day. It would have been so easy to sack it off, but I didn\u2019t want to be the same as everyone else. That was the motivation to get back to training. Physically, six months back into training I was back at the same level, but mentally I\u2019d fallen so far behind \u2013 the guys I was competing against were way ahead. Having made up that ground, now when I compete I always think I can\u2019t mess this up \u2013 I\u2019ve worked too hard. We train for five hours a day, 25 hours a week, and within that we do weights, strength and conditioning, gymnastics and actual diving. I don\u2019t live the normal life of someone my age, but that\u2019s been the case for years. My diet goes out the window sometimes, and I\u2019ve slept in the library way too many times, but I have fear of missing out, so I have to give both uni and diving everything. The fact that your source of funding is constantly at stake based on performances is another stress. You\u2019d think all we need is a towel and some Speedos, but it costs close to \u00a310,000 a year for the bare minimum; travel to comps, training camps, Airbnbs. GB diving is so strong that nobody is guaranteed a place in Tokyo. We\u2019ve got five guys fighting for two spots, and Tom [Daley] obviously will get one, so four of us are left fighting for the second one. It could be anyone. I\u2019ve invested so much in getting to the games, I have to see it through. The gymnast:Giarnni Regini-Moran Last month, Giarnni, 20, won silver at the European Championships for the floor I was three when I went to my first gymnastics session, then at four a coach saw me pull myself upside down on the rings and they put me straight into a development group. It wasn\u2019t just the sport I loved, it was the way I felt when I was doing it. Being upside down and not knowing where you are was an adrenaline rush even at that age. Before I knew it, I was training six days a week. I was all set to go to Rio; I\u2019d won three golds and two silvers at the Europeans, I was at my peak, then everything changed. I was trying a new skill on the high bar; doing a double backflip with a full turn, but I couldn\u2019t catch the bar. It wasn\u2019t happening so I was getting annoyed. I pumped myself up and went for it and I caught the bar with my left hand, but my right missed so I swung round on one arm, shot off to the side and hit the wall with a straight leg. It snapped and I was in agony. It was so swollen I had to wait three months to have surgery. The injury was so severe, they had to take tendons from my good leg to make a ligament. my leg was in a brace for nine months and I had to learn to walk again. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even lift my own leg so I couldn\u2019t even imagine myself jumping, let alone getting back to being a world-class gymnast. I thought it was game over. I was away from the training environment, on bed rest watching TV so I got lazy, but Team GB took me out to Rio to watch. It was a long flight with my leg in a brace, so it flared up like a balloon, but I didn\u2019t care \u2013 I was going to watch the Olympics! That put the fire back in belly. I met a sports psychologist there and asked her for her help. Coming home all I could think was, \u201cGet me back in the gym.\u201d Learning to walk again was a huge battle. My leg shook with each tiny step because I\u2019d been in a brace for nearly nine months, so I had no quads, no calves, nothing. Once I got the confidence back walking \u2013 after nine months, I started increasing the speed, from there I did little jumps and I built up from there. To get mentally and physically well took a good two years. Injury isn\u2019t my biggest fear, not making the team after working so hard is. I\u2019m in the gym six days a week, missing family holidays and nights at the pub with my mates. There are nights where I\u2019m exhausted, my hands are cut up and blistered and I\u2019ve got to go catch the bar but I can\u2019t afford to lose focus, because that\u2019s when things go wrong. That\u2019s all got to come down to the Olympic Games. The fear is doing all of this, then not making it. My greatest achievement isn\u2019t a medal or a championship \u2013 it\u2019s coming back. At the World Cup in Tokyo in April I went up against the Japanese gymnast Kenzo Shirai \u2013 he\u2019s been world champion numerous times, and should have won at Rio but he made an error. I looked down at my scars and went for it. When my score came up I\u2019d beaten him. That was all I needed \u2013 I\u2019d beaten the best in the world. I could finally say I was a world-class gymnast again. I\u2019ve been in the gym since I was three years old, all I want is to go to the Olympic Games. The BMXer: Kye Whyte Kye, 19, from Peckham, south London, is ranked number seven in the world \u201cI grew up in south London, one of six brothers and sisters. My older brother Daniel was the first one to join the GB team, then Tre and now me. I learnt to ride a bike when I was two, started riding a BMX when I was three, then at four I started competing. When I was a little kid I had full-body eczema and really bad asthma, so I had to use these massive asthma pumps, but doctors said BMX would help, so I used to ride round until I couldn\u2019t breathe, take my inhaler then keep going. It was bad for my eczema \u2013 dusty and dry \u2013 but my mum kept on top of that. From the age of five to 13 I won 10 British championships. I got to the point where I would race up two age classes, so I would be eight racing 10-year-old boys and I was still winning, but when I got to aged 13 I had a massive accident. I knocked myself out for five days, I had a bleed on the brain, a broken jaw and I didn\u2019t ride for a year and a half. I was racing the older boys and someone crashed in front of me. I tried to move out of the way in midair, which is impossible, so I fell and knocked myself out. I don\u2019t really remember the accident, or much for months after it but I didn\u2019t go to school for months because my cheek was completely off \u2013 I needed a skin graft and I had to eat through a straw. I couldn\u2019t exercise, I was bedbound but I knew I wanted to get back on the bike, it was just a case of when and how. After 11 months I went back to the doctor and my brain looked fine, so I could ride again. That first session back I was training as hard as I could and constantly being sick, but nothing was going to stop me. It wasn\u2019t until I was 16 going on 17 that I started to get my confidence, my skills and my speed back \u2013 and got back on the GB team. One of my highest points was winning the World Cup in Manchester this year. The first day I was confident I could make the final and hopefully win it. I got to the semi-finals but then someone crashed in front of me and my day was done. I had a drop of confidence and the second day my starts weren\u2019t as good, but the one time I did get a good start was in the final, and it worked out. It was unbelievable to win. Getting to training is a daily challenge. In winter I just want to quit. I can\u2019t stand it. Trying to keep the motivation week in, week out is the worst because it\u2019s 10am until 5pm. We do track work, then bike work on the flat, sprints from a dead stop and gym work. Doing that nonstop with no competitions is draining. It gets you really strong and that gets you the outcome, which is where you get the motivation from, but it\u2019s relentless. This year, because of the Olympics, we started in February and we\u2019ll compete right the way up to October with no breaks. From the World Cup in September last year to next July every race counts for Olympic points \u2013 we get points as riders and for our country. If GB gets in the top two, three riders can go, if it\u2019s top five to three we get two riders and after that it\u2019s one rider. The goal is to get three but we only have five riders, while other countries have ten. When I\u2019m racing I have to keep composed, because you make the littlest mistake and the other riders will hunt you and catch you. You can crash at any time, and that crash can put you out for a year. Eight people are going over a massive jump at once, and it\u2019s a contact sport so you can take each other off. Sam Willoughby was one of the best ever, but he flipped off the bike and was paralysed. If he was still racing now, I\u2019d be racing him. Whenever I crash I think, \u201cWhy do I do this?\u201d But then I still get on and go again. The highs are better than the lows. That\u2019s why I\u2019m pursuing this. The boxer: Ellie Scotney Ellie, 21, is a 57kg featherweight boxer from Catford, southeast London If I had a kid, I wouldn\u2019t let them box, because I know how much you have to sacrifice for it. I\u2019d put them in ballet classes. My kid would be girly as anything. I\u2019m in Sheffield Monday to Thursday, I get up at 6.30am, weigh myself, then I\u2019m on the track at 7am to run \u2013 and I hate running. I\u2019d rather get smacked in my face 10 times than run 100m. Then I either do pads or strength work, and then it\u2019s sparring. In London on Fridays I have longer sessions, and Saturday I either spa or run. Sometimes I think a nine to five would be easier \u2013 when you\u2019re at home you switch off, but with boxing it\u2019s 24/7. I grew up in Catford in southeast London. My brother boxed and I followed him like his little shadow. I begged him to take me to the gym, but eventually my cousin Jim gave in instead. I was a little fat kid and nobody was taking girls\u2019 boxing seriously then, so it faded out after about a year. My coach Colin kept saying, \u201cEllie, come back to the gym,\u201d and I would laugh and say, \u201cYeah yeah, I\u2019ll be back.\u201d Then when I was 16 he passed away and I felt like I owed it to him to go back. I walked in the gym at 75kg and Sam \u2013 my coach now \u2013 said \u201cEllie, you\u2019ve got to sort yourself out, look at you!\u201d I decided I was going to prove those idiots wrong, and six weeks later I\u2019d lost 15kg and everything flowed. When you walk into a gym as a girl, people don\u2019t necessarily give you the respect \u2013 they think girls\u2019 boxing is a cat fight, but once you start fighting they recognise you\u2019re not a girl boxer, you\u2019re a boxer. I had my first fight a week after my 17th birthday, then I won the youth ABAs with only four fights under my belt. I was offered a place on a GB programme, but I didn\u2019t want a golden ticket, I wanted to know I\u2019d earned my place so I said no and went straight into the senior ABAs without a senior fight, because they kept falling through. I won the senior ABAs at 19 and got on to the GB squad. Not long after that, though, I was out for 18 months because I broke my hand, and I was an idiot and carried on boxing. They had to get bone from my hip and put it in my hand with pins. I was a mess, mentally and physically. I was coming to the club constantly, just punching the bag with my right hand, running, skipping. I put all my frustrations on to everyone else, but that experience taught me to listen, so I\u2019m grateful for it now. I lost to a French girl, Mona Mestiaen, in my last fight before I got injured, then I drew her first in my first tournament back. She\u2019d got a European medal in that time, but I gave her a count in the first round and beat her. Then in the European final I boxed this girl who was about 8ft tall and her arms were down to her ankles, and I only went in at about 60% so to walk out with silver medal was incredible. I\u2019ve got to give it 100% not just in terms of how I\u2019m training, but how I\u2019m living, because everyone is world class. I\u2019ve never drunk alcohol, I obviously don\u2019t smoke and I\u2019ve never even set foot in a nightclub. I spent my 21st birthday in Russia without my family, but it was perfect because I got through to the finals of the Europeans. I miss out on family holidays and birthdays all the time. My friends say, \u201cEllie, you\u2019ve got to live a bit,\u201d but this is me living. Before a fight I always think, \u201cWhy am I doing this?\u201d In that moment, I hate boxing \u2013 it tests you so much. Before my first fight in the world championships I had Delhi belly so I knew if I took a body shot, it was going to be the end of me. I said to coach Dave Pocknell, \u201cI hate this bit Dave\u201d and he said, \u201cYou should love it because that ring is your home, go get in there.\u201d He\u2019s right \u2013 it\u2019s all in the mind.When I think about going to the Olympics it makes my belly turn over, but that ring in Tokyo is where I\u2019m meant to be.",

The 2018 survey also found that while immigration, the environment and trade with other countries are not prioritised by the public overall, for each of these issues there is a significant minority who it to be very important. Although these priorities are of higher importance to some groups than others, the 2019 follow-up survey showed a general increase in the prioritisation of the environment (including among older voters) and a decreasing prioritisation of immigration across most groups.

The radio exchanges make no reference to a previous Iranian suggestion that the British-flagged oil tanker had been stopped due to an accident with a fishing vessel, a previous explanation given by Tehran for the capture of the ship. A spokesman for Iran\u2019s supreme council also did little to hide the view from Tehran that the seizure was justifiable retaliation for the British capture of an Iranian-flagged ship, Grace 1, off Gibraltar. The UK says Grace 1 was bound for Syria to unload Iranian oil in breach of an EU embargo. The recording, obtained by the British maritime security firm Dryad Global, includes exchanges between the Royal Navy frigate HMS Montrose and Iranian armed forces vessels, in which the frigate attempts to seek assurances that the tanker is not being captured. The Iranian vessel can be heard telling a ship \u2013 believed to be the Stena Impero \u2013 to change its course, saying: \u201cIf you obey you will be safe. Alter your course to 360 degrees immediately.\u201d HMS Montrose can be heard identifying itself in the recording. It tells the Stena Impero: \u201cI reiterate as you are conducting transit passage in a recognised international strait, under international law your passage must not be impaired, impeded, obstructed or hampered.\u201d The frigate then asks the Iranian vessel to confirm it is not \u201cintending to violate international law\u201d by attempting to board the tanker. The Iranian captain replies: \u201cI want to inspect the ship for security reasons.\u201d Montrose responds: \u201cPlease confirm that you have no intention of violating international law by attempting to enter the ship illegally.\u201d There are different reports as how close HMS Montrose was to the Stena Impero at the time of its capture on Friday, but the Ministry of Defence confirmed that the ship was 60 minutes away, underlining how thinly spread the British protection force is through the Gulf, especially the Strait of Hormuz, the busiest and narrowest waterway in the world for the transport of oil and gas products. Video released by Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard-affiliated Fars news agency on Saturday appeared to show the moment the tanker was raided. It shows masked forces dropping down ropes on to the ship from a helicopter after it was surrounded by high-speed vessels. In a tweet, Zarif said: \u201cIt is Iran that guarantees the security of the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz. Unlike the piracy in the Strait of Gibraltar, our action in the Persian Gulf is to uphold international maritime rules.\u201d A spokesman for Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), Brig-Ge Ramezan Sharif, said Tehran had seized the ship despite the \u201cresistance and interference\u201d of a British warship that had been escorting it. Iran\u2019s Fars news agency said the Revolutionary Guards had taken control of the Stena Impero on Friday after it collided with an Iranian fishing boat whose distress call it ignored. The vessel, carrying no cargo, was taken to the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas with its 23 crew \u2013 18 of whom are Indian \u2013 while the accident was investigated, Iranian news agencies quoted the head of Ports and Maritime Organization in southern Hormozgan province, Allahmorad Afifipour, as saying. Afifpour said members of the crew may be interviewed on technical matters. \u2022 This article was amended on 22 July 2019. An earlier version misquoted the recording of the Iranian vessel as saying \u201cAlter your course 2360 degrees\u201d.",

And of the 70 outdoor sculptures, my favourite was by Indian artist Subodh Kerkar, who had satirised 14th-century traveller John Mandeville\u2019s claim that he\u2019d discovered a tree in India that bore \u201ctiny lambs\u201d as fruit. It had been the Englishman\u2019s first brush with the cotton plant. I had my own brush with the lesser-known valley of Nidderdale, discovering Ramsgill\u2019s church hidden behind an explosion of popcorn-pink cherry blossom. Reaching Middlesmoor, at the head of the dale, I jumped out for a walk on to In Moor, only to be assailed by hailstones. I took this as nature\u2019s way of telling me to head for a campsite. And at Studfold \u2013 one of many sites where you can charge the van overnight for free \u2013 I found the owner Ian celebrating its 60th anniversary. \u201cThe creation of the campsite started by accident,\u201d he said. \u201cAn angler turned up at what was then my grandfather\u2019s farm and asked if he could pop his caravan in a corner of a field.\u201d It was a spot well chosen, as it has cracking views of hills to the east. By contrast, the previous night I\u2019d stayed at the Old Station caravan park outside Masham, whose reception \u2013 once a goods shed \u2013 is lined with black-and-white photos of the former branch line stop axed by Dr Beeching. On my final day I bimbled into Pateley Bridge for a stroll along River Nidd and a visit to the self-styled \u201coldest sweet shop in England\u201d. Ten minutes later I was gnawing on a Pontefract cake at the local art group\u2019s biannual exhibition. Feeling reckless, I bought tickets at the tombola stall and \u2013 boom! \u2013 snared a pack of pop-up cupcake boxes. Winners gonna win. It was only when getting back on the train that I discovered the one downside to my trip: my cheeks ached. But that\u2019s what comes of spending 48 hours with a great big stupid grin on your face. \u2022 The trip was hosted by eDub (edubtrips.co.uk); Indie can be hired for \u00a3149 a night (including campsite) for three- or four-night trips. Rail travel was provided by LNER (lner.co.uk); London to York from \u00a318 one-way. The train from York to Knaresborough with Northern (northernrailway.co.uk) starts at \u00a37.70 one-way",

I guess that\u2019s what happens when you share your tiny flat with 30 or so tanks and terrariums, in all shapes and sizes. So, as you asked, here are my tips for keeping your ecosystem under glass healthy and mould free.</p> <p>Terrariums are an ingenious piece of technology first invented in the 19th century by amateur naturalist Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward. He discovered that delicate, moisture-loving plants, like ferns and mosses, that were next to impossible to grow in the dry, drafty air of Victorian parlours suddenly thrived when the humidity and warmth were sealed around them in closed glass cases. Unfortunately, the same sky-high humidity levels that keep these plants alive can also be perfect for the growth of mould, which can strike without warning and soon overtake a terrarium. However, there are three simple steps you can take to keep the balance in check.</p> <p>The best thing you can do to stop the spread of an infection is to spot it early. Inspect your terrarium once a week for any signs of fuzzy, white filaments creeping over the soil surface. I dampen the patch to prevent the airborne spores from spreading and wipe the moistened mould away with a soft paintbrush. You can use plain tap water to do this, but there is one thing that\u2019s even better: cold chamomile tea. Chamomile plants contain a range of natural antifungal agents to fight off infections, and made into tea these compounds are extracted into an easily administered solution.</p> <p>In fact, I water all my terrariums once a week by spraying them sparingly with a cold chamomile tea poured into an atomiser. This neatly brings us on to the main cause of mould growth: overwatering. Given their lack of drainage holes and sealed tops, closed terrariums need very little extra watering, and certainly never use a watering can. Doing this can cause root rot, which not only kills plants but creates the perfect environment for fungal infection (both of which are related).</p> <p>As a general guide, a light misting with a fine spray just to moisten the leaves, only when condensation on the glass completely disappears (which for me is about once a week or every 10 days) is a good guide.</p> <p>Finally, let\u2019s talk aeration. Yes, good ventilation will prevent mould growth.

If you are growing relatively resilient ferns and moth orchids, leaving the lid off the terrarium one day a week would be beneficial.

The EPA administrator, Andrew Wheeler, this week confirmed what many Americans already know: when the Trump administration weighs the competing interests of corporate profits versus public health, the corporations win, hands down. Wheeler announced Thursday that despite what independent scientists say is a wealth of evidence tying the popular insecticide known as chlorpyrifos to neurodevelopmental damage in children, the pesticide should continue to be applied by farmers to foods that children regularly consume, including apples, grapes, broccoli and cherries.

      "bodyText": "The defence minister Tobias Ellwood has rejected the charge that a British-flagged tanker seized by Iran in the Gulf could have been better protected, and said the priority for the UK must be to de-escalate tensions. Ellwood also called for more spending on the Royal Navy, and said the US\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal had played a part in the increasing tensions in the region. Among critics of UK government actions ahead of the seizure of the Stena Impero in what the British says were international waters has been Admiral Lord West, the former first sea lord. Writing in the Observer, West said ministers should have done more, suggesting those responsible for such decisions were distracted by the race to succeed Theresa May. But asked on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme whether the UK had taken its \u201ceye off the ball\u201d, Ellwood replied: \u201cNo, not at all.\u201d While the UK was sending another destroyer and a support ship to the region, he said, British vessels were going through 100 nautical miles of waterway every day. \u201cIt is impossible simply to escort each individual vessel,\u201d he said. Ellwood, the under-secretary of state for defence people and veterans, added that the situation had also changed quickly. \u201cLet\u2019s place it into context \u2013 this has been a sudden spike in activity, in threat, that\u2019s ratcheted up in the last few weeks. And it takes time to respond there.\u201d Asked what the response should be, he said: \u201cFirstly we need to try and de-escalate this. We\u2019ve seen a ratcheting up of tensions in the Middle East.\u201d The situation with the tanker was, he argued, \u201cpart of a wider geo-political challenge that Iran is facing with the west\u201d. Ellwood said: \u201cSo our first and most important responsibility is to make sure we get a solution to the issue to do with the current ship, make sure that other British-flagged ships are safe to operate in these waters, and then look at the wider picture of having a working, proper, professional relationship with Iran. \u201cBut this is a hostile act, let\u2019s not dodge away from that. This is a serious matter which Iran must recognise.\u201d Asked if sanctions were possible, Ellwood said the government\u2019s Cobra emergencies committee met on Saturday, \u201cso we\u2019re looking at the operational responsibilities from that but, yes, we are going to be looking at a series of options\u201d. He called for more money to be invested in defence. \u201cIf we want to continue playing a role on the international stage \u2013 bearing in mind that threats are changing, all happening just beneath the threshold of all-out war \u2013 then we must invest more in our defence, including our Royal Navy. \u201cOur Royal Navy is too small to manage our interests across the globe, if that\u2019s our future intentions, and that\u2019s something the next prime minister will need to recognise.\u201d Asked if the US\u2019s withdrawal from the nuclear deal played a role, Ellwood said: \u201cThere is a concern that we have a difference of opinion with the United States on the nuclear itself.

While the Australians fell 35-17 to South Africa in their Rugby Championship clash in Johannesburg, there was still plenty to celebrate with Naisarani\u2019s appearance five years in the making.</p> <p>Growing up idolising the likes of Fijian powerhouse Rupeni Caucaunibuca and former Wallabies George Gregan and Stephen Larkham, the 24-year-old moved to Australia in 2014 with the aim of playing for his adopted country.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s time for me to leave you now, I hope you\u2019ve enjoyed another wonderful Sunday of sport. I leave you in the capable hands of my esteemed colleague Geoff Lemon, who will take you through the final day of the Women\u2019s Ashes Test. It starts in just under half an hour so get yourself settled in for some great cricket, followed by the Diamonds battling it out for the Netball World Cup at 1:45am - we will have a live blog up for that too, so set your alarms and get ready! Another upset for this round, it\u2019s a bit of a tipster\u2019s nightmare it seems. Jack Lonie continued his form in the second half, finishing with four goals and eight marks, while Jack Billings was also on fire with 27 disposals and eight marks. Meanwhile for the Dogs, Jack Macrae came away with 34 disposals and seven marks. By the way, has anyone done an audit on all the Jacks in the AFL? Do we need so many? Could some of them be swapped to cricket perhaps? Maybe some kind of Mitchell - Jack switch could be arranged. Football: Goal celebrations can get pretty over the top in a sport where goals are often few and far between. So it\u2019s beautiful to see one that is just so filled with pure joy and love of the game. Cycling: An interesting article today from William Fotheringham on the role La Course plays in the advancement of women\u2019s cycling. It seems to be a theme at the moment - female athletes fighting to get to compete in longer and more challenging competitions. WinnieOfOz has been kind enough to share tipping strategies with us: 1) When it comes to your own team: heart. 2) When it comes to other teams, mostly safe, but with the odd upset. As I said a few weeks ago, sometimes I change my tip depending on gut feel, but that had such a poor success rate that I wondered about the ability of my gut. If St Kilda win tonight though, I\u2019ll be sticking with it. Swimming: The talk of the Fina World Championship is all about Sun Yang at the moment. He and Mack Horton have had to be separated for training out of fear of a confrontation. Hopefully the focus will shift to Horton if he is able to regain his form and blow Sun out of the water when the finals roll around. There is plenty of ill feeling around Sun being allowed to compete before his Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) hearing, set for September, when he will face charges of smashing vials of his blood with a hammer in a clash last year with testers. Netball: The first game of the final day of the Netball World Cup is underway, with Zimbabwe taking on Uganda in the 7th place play-off. Uganda will be the favourites due to their superior world ranking (they are currently 6th in the world, while Zimbabwe are 13th). However Zimbabwe have been the crowd favourites of this tournament and their players and supporters have endeared themselves to the fans of every other nation, so they will find plenty of support in stadium. Following this match, Jamaica will play Malawi for 5th place, which will be hugely disappointing for the world number 2 team Jamaica. This hasn\u2019t been their tournament unfortunately. The big games come later tonight with England v South Africa in the bronze medal match at 11:30pm AEST followed by Australia v New Zealand in the gold medal match at 1:45am AEST. The rest of the placings have been decided and finished up as such: 9th Trinidad &amp; Tobago 10th Northern Ireland 11th Scotland 12th Barbados 13th Samoa 14th Fiji 15th Sri Lanka 16th Singapore Dr Rudi has some thoughts on the team for the first Ashes Test. Without knowing the pitch, Lyon ought be in the 11. The other fast bowlers in the squad (Michael Neser, Jackson Bird, Peter Siddle and Chris Tremain) might have to bide their time. Dark horse: Neser, as the fastest all-rounder. Also, Usman Khawaja is straight in, if he gets over the hamstring injury. Meanwhile WinnieOfOz tells me I am indeed treasonous for tipping against my team. I\u2019m keen to hear more about your tipping strategies - head or heart? Do you go for the upsets or take the safe wins? Let me know in the comments. A stronger second half for the Eels, but unfortunately they couldn\u2019t get across the line for the win. Two tries in the final 20 minutes from Nathan Brown and Maika Sivo weren\u2019t enough and the Eels continue their up and down form this season, but hold on to their position in the eight. With the Warriors and the Dragons to come in their next two matches, they will look to build some momentum into the back end of the season. The Demons managed to give the Eagles an almighty scare for a while there, but ultimately couldn\u2019t maintain the intensity to pull off the upset. Three second half goals from Jack Darling to take his match tally to four were crucial for the Eagles as they pulled off a win that in the end was comfortable, but far from commanding. The Alice Springs crowd was right behind the Eagles, in full voice as the team song rang around the grounds. It was a very special day for the team from the west, with five Indigenous players taking the field in the blue and gold. Speaking after the game Willie Rioli said \u201cIt feels like home being in the NT, I\u2019ve got a lot of mates here. It\u2019s good to see their faces again. It (Indigenous representation in the team) is definitely something we\u2019ve been working on the last year. I\u2019m stoked to see all this hard work pay off today. It was a pretty special day.\u201d AFL: Half-time at Docklands and St Kilda lead the Bulldogs by 43 points. Jack Lonie has been doing the damage for the Saints, with three goals and 11 disposals at 63% efficiency. A spectacular goal from Hunter Clark got the Saints pumped just a couple of minutes before half-time and they will be pushing to keep their momentum going into the second half. Water Polo: Heading back to Korea now and the Aussie Sharks have made it through to the quarter finals at the Fina World Championships. I must admit I have difficulty getting on board with national teams who include \u201cAussie\u201d in their official name, but full credit to the boys, they are having a cracker of a tournament over there. Commenter Dr Rudi assures me I\u2019m not alone in my tipping strategy of always going against my team. I have had a fair few people think that it was akin to treason however. But it does explain why I am doing very well in my NRL tipping comps this year just as the Dragons are failing to play like something that remotely resembles a rugby league team. I\u2019ll take my consolation prize and cry in the corner with it, thank you. Cricket: For some reason, someone asked Darren Lehmann his opinion on the team that should be selected for the first Ashes Test. Not that I\u2019m incredibly invested in his opinion, but I am in yours faithful blog readers. Let me know in the comments who you would have in your team. If anyone is interested, Lehmann\u2019s team is: David Warner, Cameron Bancroft, Marcus Harris, Steve Smith, Travis Head, Joe Burns, Tim Paine (capt), James Pattinson/Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood, Nathan Lyon. Hopefully you can be more decisive and not give me one extra pace bowler! Tennis: Apparently a lot of non-tennis playing reckon they could win a point against Serena Williams we heard recently. If you\u2019ve ever thought that maybe you could, this video will probably provide you with a sobering realisation. Rugby: While it didn\u2019t seem like there was much to celebrate out of the Wallabies\u2019 loss to the Springboks this weekend, one small Fijian village begs to differ. The people of Naqali were full of pride as local Isi Naisarani made his Wallabies debut in the back row. From AAP: Fiji watching as Naisarani becomes a Wallaby The small Fijian village of Naqali was jumping over the weekend with family and friends of back-rower Isi Naisarani gathering to watch his Wallabies debut. While the Australians fell 35-17 to South Africa in their Rugby Championship clash in Johannesburg, there was still plenty to celebrate with Naisarani\u2019s appearance five years in the making. Growing up idolising the likes of Fijian powerhouse Rupeni Caucaunibuca and former Wallabies George Gregan and Stephen Larkham, the 24-year-old moved to Australia in 2014 with the aim of playing for his adopted country. But a visa issue saw his three-year residency qualification restarted in 2016, which meant he only qualified for selection in April this year. Naisarani, who was Melbourne\u2019s players\u2019 player this Super Rugby season, was excited the big moment had finally arrived. And so were the people of Naqali, which is about 30 minutes inland from the capital Suva. \u201cIt\u2019s unreal to make my Test debut. I feel humble. I\u2019ve been waiting for so long to get this opportunity. It\u2019s a blessing for me,\u201d Naisarani said. \u201cI\u2019ve been getting heaps of messages, texts from back home. All my family, friends, my village stayed up to watch as the kick-off was 3am back home. They are definitely proud of me. When I came to Australia my dream was to play for the Wallabies, so to now get this opportunity is a blessing.\u201d While Australia\u2019s performance wasn\u2019t perfect, Wallabies coach Michael Cheika said No.8 Naisarani did everything expected of him against the burly Boks, clocking up seven runs including two tackle-busts. \u201cI thought Naisarani had an excellent debut, he was involved in the game,\u201d Cheika said after the match. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have a very high error count and he was present all the time. He made some crucial catches and he defended with physicality. \u201c Cricket: As we head into the final day of the Women\u2019s Ashes it\u2019s worth reflecting on why these Tests don\u2019t happen more often? Megan Schutt wrote on this issue earlier this week and makes some excellent points about why the powers that be need to embrace this format in the women\u2019s game. NRL: Half-time at Brookvale and Manly are in control of the match, leading Parramatta 26-12. With five tries in the first half, the home team are looking strong and Daly Cherry-Evans is very happy with his players. Reuben Garrick has been the star for the Eels, gaining 88 metres for the match so far, as well as scoring the opening try and adding three conversions with the boot. AFL: Commenter WinnieOfOz notes: Yikes, Melbourne, hadn\u2019t seen the score for a while. Now I\u2019m convinced, the difference between 1 - 17 is not that great that \u2018on the day\u2019 anything can happen. Which is great for our game, but not for our tipping! Totally agree - why won\u2019t anyone think of our tips! My strategy is to always tip against my own team. That way, if my team wins I\u2019m happy enough that I don\u2019t care about getting my tip wrong. But if they lose, I get a correct tip as a consolation prize. Cricket: If you haven\u2019t listened to The Guardian\u2019s cricket podcast The Spin yet, give it a whirl. Host Emma John is delightful and her guests are always entertaining. This week\u2019s episode breaks down the Cricket World Cup from players of the tournament to feedback for the ICC. AFL: Up in the Red Centre, West Coast were looking comfortable for a time, but Melbourne have continued to close the gap, cutting the Eagles\u2019 lead down to just one at the break. Josh Kennedy leads the scoring for the Eagles with two goals so far. The Demons started and finished the half well and will hope to put out a more complete performance in the second half. Cricket: Just as the Australians are about to swoop on the Women\u2019s Ashes, their male counterparts are preparing for the Men\u2019s Ashes, which will start on 1 August. England will prepare against unlikely opponents Ireland later this week, as Jason Roy looks to make his case for Test selection. Golf: If you\u2019re following the British Open, you will have seen Rory McIlroy\u2019s spectacular fall from grace as he triple bogeyed his way out of contention. As our reporter Andy Bull puts it, At 10 past 10, Rory McIlroy walked on to the 1st hole the 8-1 favourite for the Open, 10 minutes later he walked off it again, a 33-1 outsider, scrambling to make the cut. Rugby: The Wallabies didn\u2019t have a good time of it over in South Africa this weekend. Can they recover in time for the World Cup? They are a team that seems to find form for big tournaments, but it is hard to see where they will dredge it from this time around. The last World Cup and the Wallabies in the final seems like a very distant memory right now. Bret Harris gave us great insight into the team this week as they prepared for The Rugby Championship. A double from Suliasi Vunivalu highlighted the total dominance of the Melbourne Storm. They seem to be unstoppable at the moment, on a nine game winning streak and building to the finals with all the momentum of a downhill freight train. The Titans meanwhile, sit at the bottom of the ladder and their fortunes don\u2019t seem to be on the up any time soon. They will be looking forward to their match up with the Dragons in three weeks time to give them a shot at a win. Hawthorn have taken down the ladder leaders with a commanding performance at the MCG. In a highly defensive game Mitchell Lewis and Tim O\u2019Brien led the way for the Hawks in attack, with three goals apiece. An emotional post-game from Hawthorn as the victory clearly meant so much to them. Things don\u2019t get any easier for them though, as they take on the second-placed Lions next week. Swimming: The Fina World Championship is underway in Gwangju, South Korea and there are some intriguing races to come as our swimmers gear up for Tokyo 2020. Ariarne Titmus has come out swinging in her heat this morning and will look to build on that form. From AAP: Titmus sends warning to Ledecky Australia\u2019s Ariarne Titmus has thrown down the gauntlet to American great Katie Ledecky with an impressive 400m freestyle heat at the world swimming championships in South Korea. World No.2 Titmus clocked four minutes, 02.42 seconds to qualify second fastest for Sunday night\u2019s final on the first morning of the eight-day titles - just half a second behind top seed Ledecky. Five-time Olympic champion Ledecky has not been beaten over 400m, 800m and 1500m freestyle at an international meet since 2012. But the 14-time world champion will be looking over her shoulder after Titmus clocked her fastest morning heats time. \u201cI am backing myself that I have enough in me to do a really good swim tonight,\u201d Titmus said. Olympic champion Mack Horton cruised through the men\u2019s 400m freestyle heats, overcoming his disappointing national trials form to qualify fifth fastest for Sunday\u2019s final. Australian teammate Jack McLoughlin clocked a personal best to be third fastest behind top qualifier, controversial Chinese star Sun Yang. Horton\u2019s heat time of 3:45.51 was almost a second faster than his second placing in the 400m at an underwhelming trials last month. Horton only got into the world titles team on coach Jacco Verhaeren\u2019s discretion after failing to qualify in the 200m, 400m and 800m freestyle. \u201cThe trials were not a strong reflection of how I have been training, so it was a bit frustrating,\u201d Horton said. \u201cWe thought we probably needed a bit more rest (at trials) but it turns out we probably didn\u2019t - I think we have got it sorted now.\u201d Horton resumes his rivalry with Sun, who the Australian dismissed as a \u201cdrug cheat\u201d at the Rio Olympics before claiming a shock 400m freestyle gold. Sun has been allowed to compete ahead of a Court of Arbitration for Sport hearing where he faces charges of smashing a vial of his blood with a hammer in a clash with anti-doping testers last September. Australia were top qualifiers for Sunday\u2019s 4x100m freestyle women\u2019s relay final. Brianna Throssell appears to have won a swim off with Madi Wilson to fill the vacancy created by Shayna Jack\u2019s late withdrawal after going fastest in the heat. Australia were fourth fastest for the men\u2019s 4x100m freestyle final. Ahead of Sunday night\u2019s semi-finals, world No.2 Emma McKeon was second fastest in the 100m butterfly and Matthew Wilson was sixth quickest in the 100m breaststroke. Cricket: Another sleep-stealing event, the Women\u2019s Ashes, will wrap up its only Test match tonight, with the Australians in the box seat to come away with a draw, which will allow them to secure the Ashes trophy before the T20s even begin. Geoff Lemon has been following the team\u2019s progress and has summarised the differences between the two teams here beautifully. Netball: If you missed the semi-final last night, it was a cracker! Unfortunately for Australian fans the final will be on at 1:45am AEST but I can guarantee it will be worth waking up for. Australia and NZ have a history of absolutely cracking gold medal matches and after the Diamonds\u2019 50-49 win on Thursday, this one is sure to be no different. In the meantime, get yourself caught up with Erin Delahunty\u2019s match report from last night\u2019s nailbiter of a semi-final against South Africa. Hello and welcome to a huge Sunday of sport! I don\u2019t know about you, but I am struggling with finding time to sleep lately with all the sport happening on the other side of the world. Pretty inconsiderate really. So let\u2019s all get caffeinated up and get into it. We\u2019ve got some AFL, some NRL, plus we\u2019ll be checking in on the Fina World Championship in South Korea and getting all geared up for the Women\u2019s Ashes and Netball World Cup final happening over in the UK tonight.",

      "body": "<p>The world has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/16/street-in-wales-wins-guinness-world-record-steepest\" title=\"\">a new steepest street</a>! But it\u2019s more than 1,000 years old. So, did something happen to the previous steepest street? Is this an off-colour attempt to look on the bright side of a horrendous natural disaster? No, the previous steepest street is still there.</p> <p>So, has the old one somehow got less steep, perhaps because of a horrendous natural disaster? No, it\u2019s as steep as ever. There is no horrendous natural disaster involved with this story. So what\u2019s happened?</p> <p>Well, a street has been discovered that\u2019s steeper than the street that, for some years, has been proclaiming itself to be the world\u2019s steepest street. But how can a street be discovered? Was it buried? Is it part of a newly unearthed hilly suburb of Pompeii? No, stop trying to link it to horrendous natural disasters.</p> <p>The new steepest street has been in continuous occupation since time immemorial. Much longer, in fact, than its predecessor as holder of the accolade. So, the fact is \u2013 and I hate to be rude about what we now know is, at best, the second steepest street in the world \u2013 that this predecessor was an impostor, a usurper, albeit an unknowing one. It was never steepest. Even on the day of its construction, a steeper street already existed.</p> <p>Fundamentally, this is a damning indictment of the system by which the title of world\u2019s steepest street is awarded, a process that, slightly suspiciously, appears to have something to do with Guinness. Common sense suggests that Guinness is not a substance likely to be of help in the global ranking of gradients in built-up areas.</p> <p>I should clarify that there is no suggestion that the whole steepest street issue got screwed up because everyone involved was off their face on Guinness, or even that their concentrations were marginally impaired by the responsible enjoyment of Guinness. They may not have drunk any Guinness at all. The link with Guinness is pretty tenuous. Guinness World Records, formerly the Guinness Book of Records, isn\u2019t even owned by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/diageo\" title=\"\">Diageo plc</a> (which owns Guinness) any more.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/16/street-in-wales-wins-guinness-world-record-steepest\">Street in Wales wins record for world's steepest</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the fact remains that it\u2019s called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guinness-world-records\" title=\"\">Guinness World Records</a> because of Guinness, the drink, not because of a random Andrew or Steve or Janet Guinness who loved measuring things and decided to put them all in a book. So there\u2019s Guinness all over this mess and perhaps we all ought to think about that before we buy any more Guinness.</p> <p>It turns out, you see, that when a street claims to be the steepest in the world, Guinness World Records is rigorous about the evidence of the street\u2019s existence and precise steepness that must be provided.

      "bodyText": "The world has a new steepest street! But it\u2019s more than 1,000 years old. So, did something happen to the previous steepest street? Is this an off-colour attempt to look on the bright side of a horrendous natural disaster? No, the previous steepest street is still there. So, has the old one somehow got less steep, perhaps because of a horrendous natural disaster? No, it\u2019s as steep as ever. There is no horrendous natural disaster involved with this story. So what\u2019s happened? Well, a street has been discovered that\u2019s steeper than the street that, for some years, has been proclaiming itself to be the world\u2019s steepest street. But how can a street be discovered? Was it buried? Is it part of a newly unearthed hilly suburb of Pompeii? No, stop trying to link it to horrendous natural disasters. The new steepest street has been in continuous occupation since time immemorial. Much longer, in fact, than its predecessor as holder of the accolade. So, the fact is \u2013 and I hate to be rude about what we now know is, at best, the second steepest street in the world \u2013 that this predecessor was an impostor, a usurper, albeit an unknowing one. It was never steepest. Even on the day of its construction, a steeper street already existed. Fundamentally, this is a damning indictment of the system by which the title of world\u2019s steepest street is awarded, a process that, slightly suspiciously, appears to have something to do with Guinness. Common sense suggests that Guinness is not a substance likely to be of help in the global ranking of gradients in built-up areas. I should clarify that there is no suggestion that the whole steepest street issue got screwed up because everyone involved was off their face on Guinness, or even that their concentrations were marginally impaired by the responsible enjoyment of Guinness. They may not have drunk any Guinness at all. The link with Guinness is pretty tenuous. Guinness World Records, formerly the Guinness Book of Records, isn\u2019t even owned by Diageo plc (which owns Guinness) any more. But the fact remains that it\u2019s called Guinness World Records because of Guinness, the drink, not because of a random Andrew or Steve or Janet Guinness who loved measuring things and decided to put them all in a book. So there\u2019s Guinness all over this mess and perhaps we all ought to think about that before we buy any more Guinness. It turns out, you see, that when a street claims to be the steepest in the world, Guinness World Records is rigorous about the evidence of the street\u2019s existence and precise steepness that must be provided. So when the advocates of Baldwin Street in Dunedin, New Zealand, (until recently proclaimed the world\u2019s steepest street) said it had a gradient of 35%, that assertion was carefully verified as was the fact that it is genuinely a street rather than a random strip of mountainside devoid of asphalt or dwellings. Where the rigour lapsed, however, was in failing to check whether there were any other streets that were steeper. It\u2019s a strange lapse, when you think about it. It seems so obvious: in order to know which is the world\u2019s steepest street, you need to measure the steepness of every street in the world. Now, you may say that that is one hell of a logistical challenge. Who\u2019s going to pay for that to be done? Not Diageo plc. And the wearying expense and difficulty is, to my mind, only compounded by the undeniable truth that finding out which of the world\u2019s millions of streets happens to be steepest is a colossally unimportant task. I would have been content with a state of affairs where everyone agreed that Baldwin Street in Dunedin is certainly jolly steep, and probably a lot steeper than most streets, and we left it at that. The problem came in choosing to elevate that undeniable status to \u201cworld\u2019s steepest street\u201d without knowing how steep all the other ones were. It\u2019s a strange mistake for a records organisation to make. You\u2019d think that Guinness World Records, of all institutions, would be well aware that a person or thing being very [insert adjective] does not make it particularly likely that they are the most [insert adjective] in the entire world.

      "body": "<p>The woman in the photographs had an eventful year. Which year, exactly, is unclear \u2013 judging by the number plate on her car and her three-quarter-length cargo shorts, it was sometime between May 1995 and the early 2000s. It\u2019s undoubtable, however, that she had a good time: she went to see the Eagles perform live in concert, travelled abroad and splashed around in a sunlit swimming pool, visited an exotic bird sanctuary, witnessed a snow storm and then, to round it all off, posed semi-nude in her kitchen, exhibiting her nearly bare bum.</p> <p>She looks to be in her late 20s or early 30s, and registered her car (or bought a car registered in) Leicester. I don\u2019t know her name because she is a complete stranger, although I have now seen 36 snapshots of her life shot on a roll of Kodak Gold 35mm film. I bought the mysterious film on eBay, developed it myself and relished the results.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9c08c53d5910f46d77bcdaf8dfd47cc4b80ee04\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9c08c53d5910f46d77bcdaf8dfd47cc4b80ee04/0_0_1848_1372/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Green car in 70s Britain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"742\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The past is a foreign country\u2026 a selection of recovered, previously undeveloped photographs</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: unknown</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A small but growing number of online hobbyists have been buying used, undeveloped film rolls. Those who sell mystery film often don\u2019t set out to trade in the stuff, instead it\u2019s usually picked up by chance at house clearances, inside old cameras or in charity shops. There are many tragic reasons why these rolls could have been forgotten about \u2013 divorce, death, dementia \u2013 and many mundane ones: film processing is expensive and it\u2019s easy to set aside a half-used roll to be finished later and simply forget about it. Used film can sell from \u00a31 to \u00a3100 on eBay, and more and more people are gathering online to celebrate their hobby. Over the past three years the subscribers to the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/forgottenfilm/\" title=\"\">Forgotten Film</a> forum on the discussion website Reddit have jumped from 822 to more than 3,000 people. The most popular post of all is an <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/forgottenfilm/comments/7lk0z6/found_8_rolls_in_an_antique_store_niagara_falls/\" title=\"\">image from the 1950s</a> of a person in an anorak framed forebodingly in front of the Niagara Falls \u2013 the film was found inside a camera in an antique store.</p> <p>The interest in buying forgotten film may be related to a boom in \u201cmystery boxes\u201d being sold on eBay. In 2017, popular YouTubers began buying these boxes, collections of unknown and random items bundled together, and opening them on camera. In this environment, sellers are taking a chance by listing mystery film rolls, while buyers are excitedly purchasing a portion of the past.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"180f211922b0654a6ded4659589fc87b1b48023b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/180f211922b0654a6ded4659589fc87b1b48023b/0_0_1765_1196/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Black-and-white image of an old car.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"678\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One collector estimates he has spent \u2018upwards of $10,000\u2019 on rolls of film over the past five years</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: unknown</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI saw an article about people selling mystery bundles of clothing or electronics, and I thought, \u2018OK, maybe someone would want them\u2019,\u201d says Diana Bright of the two used film rolls she sold to me for \u00a319.99 on eBay, one of which yielded the photos of the unknown woman I call \u201cBasia\u201d. Bright, 54, from Chelmsford, bought the film \u201cbetween eight to 10 years ago\u201d at a bric-a-brac sale. A lorry was offloading boxes of items, and Bright believes they may have been the possessions of someone who had passed away. She bought a bag of cameras because her mother was a photographer, and the used film rolls were inside.</p> <p>\u201cI probably paid about \u00a35 or \u00a36,\u201d she says now. One of the rolls Bright sold came from a Russian camera, though she can\u2019t remember which roll (could this explain my instinct to give Basia an eastern European name?) The film sat around in Bright\u2019s home for close to a decade until she saw the mystery boxes article. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure anyone would actually buy them, but I had a few inquiries.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a1083a1ed957d3967757c10ae0e7dc117ad77bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a1083a1ed957d3967757c10ae0e7dc117ad77bd/0_0_2214_1277/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Performing dolphins.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"577\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Bright tried to set \u201ca fair price\u201d for the film by looking around for other listings on eBay, and didn\u2019t want to charge too much because of the risk for the buyer. \u201cI tried to be fair because whoever buys them is taking the chance that they might be interesting or the pictures may not be of any interest at all,\u201d she says.</p> <p>For Levi Bettwieser, a 33-year-old video producer from Idaho, an interest in forgotten film can be both expensive and risky. Bettwieser estimates he has spent \u201cupwards of $10,000\u201d on rolls of film over the past five years, and says he \u201ccan get 10 rolls in a row that come out blank\u201d due to the film being degraded.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"edad5e4fd8c3d192b2365c17869bb3721ac42281\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edad5e4fd8c3d192b2365c17869bb3721ac42281/0_0_1848_1372/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Statue of the Virgin Mary in the window.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"742\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>\u201cA couple of years ago, I was winning and buying every single roll of used film on eBay,\u201d Bettwieser says. \u201cThere\u2019s always a feeling of overall excitement that you might get something amazing, something historically viable. Or you might get more cat photos.\u201d Bettwieser now runs a non-profit scheme, the <a href=\"https://www.rescuedfilm.com/\" title=\"\">Rescued Film Project</a>, where he encourages people to give him their old rolls which he then develops. \u201cPart of the reason I\u2019m doing it is because I like the idea of being the first person to ever see these images; even the photographer has never seen them.\u201d</p> <p>It makes sense that people sell old film on eBay \u2013 it\u2019s easy profit. Like buyers, sellers can also have an interest in history. Rhonda Craig is an eBay seller from North Carolina who specialises in forgotten objects \u2013 she purchases \u201cunusual, unique pieces\u201d from estate sales and sells them online. She has sold used and unused vintage camera film, as well as old photographs. Of the first used film she sold, she says: \u201cI looked at enough of the family\u2019s personal items to know that this was a lovely family, and it made me so sad it was going to be tossed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b0a087ff0ba387a0025024645496c06dbec701c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b0a087ff0ba387a0025024645496c06dbec701c/112_0_2078_1247/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman dressed for a wedding in front of a perfectly mown lawn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>People who list mystery film on eBay aren\u2019t usually selling their own photographs, but strangers\u2019 memories. Yet while selling is low risk for guaranteed profit, buying can often offer little reward. It\u2019s expensive to develop and can often yield nothing. The second roll I received from Bright featured 14 hazy images \u2013 only one picture had any visible features behind the blur: a fridge with a child\u2019s drawing stuck on it. Three other rolls I developed were completely blank, and another roll I was excited about was allegedly from the 60s, but instead featured distinctly modern images taken by a person who might have been an art student.</p> <p>So why exactly do people like Bettwieser invest time and money in forgotten film? \u201cThose last 30 seconds when you\u2019re about to see what\u2019s on the photos, my heart starts pumping a little bit,\u201d Bettwieser says. \u201cIt\u2019s the anticipation that still makes it worth it to me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff30b1eb68e233da01525ab6586c7038f1f4d6e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff30b1eb68e233da01525ab6586c7038f1f4d6e6/0_0_1762_1171/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A pair of red parrots.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In 2015, 35-year-old filmmaker Jack Jewers from London bought an old film from eBay \u201con a whim\u201d when he was \u201cslightly bored\u201d. He says: \u201cI\u2019ve always been fascinated with archive film and the idea of lost stories.\u201d He bought a film that was advertised as \u201cexposed/undeveloped/1954\u201d, and \u201cdidn\u2019t expect anything\u201d to come out. What he found was remarkable \u2013 crystal clear images of a family from Evansville, Indiana, seemingly from the 1940s. In one photo a man poses with a cigar in his mouth, clutching the shoulders of a boy in an aviator cap who is in turn clutching a small black dog. After Jewers posted the images on Facebook, other users identified a couple in the photographs as Helen and Charles Weber, a high school teacher and her husband who died in the Second World War aged just 25.</p> <p>\u201cIt was like bringing a ghost to life. It was finding a slice of life that had been hidden,\u201d Jewers says now. When we speak over the phone, he has a box in front of him full of old films he has yet to develop. \u201cI\u2019m fascinated to see what\u2019s there, but also slightly fearful as well. There\u2019s one part of me that thinks, \u2018What if there\u2019s something horrible in there?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e4a39e11afce5be757402586aebe370249c8882\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e4a39e11afce5be757402586aebe370249c8882/0_0_1762_1171/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A snowy city.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Others have also been lucky with their forgotten finds. Like Jewers, Ben Larsen, a 25-year-old IT worker from Virginia, also first bought an old film on eBay in 2015. He discovered a <a href=\"https://petapixel.com/2015/04/16/old-film-roll-from-ebay-reveals-photos-of-korea-from-half-a-century-ago/\" title=\"\">series of photos</a> of American soldiers in South Korea, taken during the Vietnam war.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really cool to uncover something that potentially would never have been seen,\u201d he says. Larsen buys and fixes up cameras to resell, and often finds old film which he develops himself. He has also bought undeveloped disposable cameras and he now helps to run Forgotten Film. \u201cEvery once in a while, you get something interesting,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve found birthday photos, a few vacations\u2026 but nothing as exciting as that first one.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84d7c40718242c8eefc8feccbc9708a7440e0892\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84d7c40718242c8eefc8feccbc9708a7440e0892/0_0_2230_1277/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Three people and a green car.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"573\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In a roll of film approximately 15-20 years old, I uncovered nothing technically significant \u2013 a photo of three people playing boules and a bizarrely beautiful image of a Virgin Mary statue in a windowsill. On a younger film \u2013 10-15 years old, though of course it could have been used at any point after then \u2013 I found photos of a young girl\u2019s first Holy Communion followed by pictures of dancing dolphins at Loro Parque, Tenerife.

      "bodyText": "The woman in the photographs had an eventful year. Which year, exactly, is unclear \u2013 judging by the number plate on her car and her three-quarter-length cargo shorts, it was sometime between May 1995 and the early 2000s. It\u2019s undoubtable, however, that she had a good time: she went to see the Eagles perform live in concert, travelled abroad and splashed around in a sunlit swimming pool, visited an exotic bird sanctuary, witnessed a snow storm and then, to round it all off, posed semi-nude in her kitchen, exhibiting her nearly bare bum. She looks to be in her late 20s or early 30s, and registered her car (or bought a car registered in) Leicester. I don\u2019t know her name because she is a complete stranger, although I have now seen 36 snapshots of her life shot on a roll of Kodak Gold 35mm film. I bought the mysterious film on eBay, developed it myself and relished the results. A small but growing number of online hobbyists have been buying used, undeveloped film rolls. Those who sell mystery film often don\u2019t set out to trade in the stuff, instead it\u2019s usually picked up by chance at house clearances, inside old cameras or in charity shops. There are many tragic reasons why these rolls could have been forgotten about \u2013 divorce, death, dementia \u2013 and many mundane ones: film processing is expensive and it\u2019s easy to set aside a half-used roll to be finished later and simply forget about it. Used film can sell from \u00a31 to \u00a3100 on eBay, and more and more people are gathering online to celebrate their hobby. Over the past three years the subscribers to the Forgotten Film forum on the discussion website Reddit have jumped from 822 to more than 3,000 people. The most popular post of all is an image from the 1950s of a person in an anorak framed forebodingly in front of the Niagara Falls \u2013 the film was found inside a camera in an antique store. The interest in buying forgotten film may be related to a boom in \u201cmystery boxes\u201d being sold on eBay. In 2017, popular YouTubers began buying these boxes, collections of unknown and random items bundled together, and opening them on camera. In this environment, sellers are taking a chance by listing mystery film rolls, while buyers are excitedly purchasing a portion of the past. \u201cI saw an article about people selling mystery bundles of clothing or electronics, and I thought, \u2018OK, maybe someone would want them\u2019,\u201d says Diana Bright of the two used film rolls she sold to me for \u00a319.99 on eBay, one of which yielded the photos of the unknown woman I call \u201cBasia\u201d. Bright, 54, from Chelmsford, bought the film \u201cbetween eight to 10 years ago\u201d at a bric-a-brac sale. A lorry was offloading boxes of items, and Bright believes they may have been the possessions of someone who had passed away. She bought a bag of cameras because her mother was a photographer, and the used film rolls were inside. \u201cI probably paid about \u00a35 or \u00a36,\u201d she says now. One of the rolls Bright sold came from a Russian camera, though she can\u2019t remember which roll (could this explain my instinct to give Basia an eastern European name?) The film sat around in Bright\u2019s home for close to a decade until she saw the mystery boxes article. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure anyone would actually buy them, but I had a few inquiries.\u201d Bright tried to set \u201ca fair price\u201d for the film by looking around for other listings on eBay, and didn\u2019t want to charge too much because of the risk for the buyer. \u201cI tried to be fair because whoever buys them is taking the chance that they might be interesting or the pictures may not be of any interest at all,\u201d she says. For Levi Bettwieser, a 33-year-old video producer from Idaho, an interest in forgotten film can be both expensive and risky. Bettwieser estimates he has spent \u201cupwards of $10,000\u201d on rolls of film over the past five years, and says he \u201ccan get 10 rolls in a row that come out blank\u201d due to the film being degraded. \u201cA couple of years ago, I was winning and buying every single roll of used film on eBay,\u201d Bettwieser says. \u201cThere\u2019s always a feeling of overall excitement that you might get something amazing, something historically viable. Or you might get more cat photos.\u201d Bettwieser now runs a non-profit scheme, the Rescued Film Project, where he encourages people to give him their old rolls which he then develops. \u201cPart of the reason I\u2019m doing it is because I like the idea of being the first person to ever see these images; even the photographer has never seen them.\u201d It makes sense that people sell old film on eBay \u2013 it\u2019s easy profit. Like buyers, sellers can also have an interest in history. Rhonda Craig is an eBay seller from North Carolina who specialises in forgotten objects \u2013 she purchases \u201cunusual, unique pieces\u201d from estate sales and sells them online. She has sold used and unused vintage camera film, as well as old photographs. Of the first used film she sold, she says: \u201cI looked at enough of the family\u2019s personal items to know that this was a lovely family, and it made me so sad it was going to be tossed.\u201d People who list mystery film on eBay aren\u2019t usually selling their own photographs, but strangers\u2019 memories. Yet while selling is low risk for guaranteed profit, buying can often offer little reward. It\u2019s expensive to develop and can often yield nothing. The second roll I received from Bright featured 14 hazy images \u2013 only one picture had any visible features behind the blur: a fridge with a child\u2019s drawing stuck on it. Three other rolls I developed were completely blank, and another roll I was excited about was allegedly from the 60s, but instead featured distinctly modern images taken by a person who might have been an art student. So why exactly do people like Bettwieser invest time and money in forgotten film? \u201cThose last 30 seconds when you\u2019re about to see what\u2019s on the photos, my heart starts pumping a little bit,\u201d Bettwieser says. \u201cIt\u2019s the anticipation that still makes it worth it to me.\u201d In 2015, 35-year-old filmmaker Jack Jewers from London bought an old film from eBay \u201con a whim\u201d when he was \u201cslightly bored\u201d. He says: \u201cI\u2019ve always been fascinated with archive film and the idea of lost stories.\u201d He bought a film that was advertised as \u201cexposed/undeveloped/1954\u201d, and \u201cdidn\u2019t expect anything\u201d to come out. What he found was remarkable \u2013 crystal clear images of a family from Evansville, Indiana, seemingly from the 1940s. In one photo a man poses with a cigar in his mouth, clutching the shoulders of a boy in an aviator cap who is in turn clutching a small black dog. After Jewers posted the images on Facebook, other users identified a couple in the photographs as Helen and Charles Weber, a high school teacher and her husband who died in the Second World War aged just 25. \u201cIt was like bringing a ghost to life. It was finding a slice of life that had been hidden,\u201d Jewers says now. When we speak over the phone, he has a box in front of him full of old films he has yet to develop. \u201cI\u2019m fascinated to see what\u2019s there, but also slightly fearful as well. There\u2019s one part of me that thinks, \u2018What if there\u2019s something horrible in there?\u2019\u201d Others have also been lucky with their forgotten finds. Like Jewers, Ben Larsen, a 25-year-old IT worker from Virginia, also first bought an old film on eBay in 2015. He discovered a series of photos of American soldiers in South Korea, taken during the Vietnam war. \u201cIt\u2019s really cool to uncover something that potentially would never have been seen,\u201d he says. Larsen buys and fixes up cameras to resell, and often finds old film which he develops himself. He has also bought undeveloped disposable cameras and he now helps to run Forgotten Film. \u201cEvery once in a while, you get something interesting,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve found birthday photos, a few vacations\u2026 but nothing as exciting as that first one.\u201d In a roll of film approximately 15-20 years old, I uncovered nothing technically significant \u2013 a photo of three people playing boules and a bizarrely beautiful image of a Virgin Mary statue in a windowsill. On a younger film \u2013 10-15 years old, though of course it could have been used at any point after then \u2013 I found photos of a young girl\u2019s first Holy Communion followed by pictures of dancing dolphins at Loro Parque, Tenerife. Even though these pictures weren\u2019t historically significant, it still felt special and somewhat magical to get a glimpse into a stranger\u2019s past. \u201cWhen you\u2019re taking a picture of someone in your house, you think you\u2019re taking a picture of them, but what\u2019s around them tells a greater story,\u201d says Bettwieser. \u201cYou look and try and piece together a story of who those people are.\u201d Jewers adds: \u201cThere\u2019s something very powerful about seeing the unfiltered faces of people from decades ago. We have no idea about why a moment meant enough for them to record, we don\u2019t know who they were, or what became of them. It\u2019s voyeurism, but it\u2019s also a privilege to open this window into the past.\u201d Forgotten film also has an added element of mystery \u2013 why were these photos never developed? \u201cBasia\u201d is the only person in all 36 of her exposures \u2013 whoever was behind the camera remains anonymous. The pictures show happy times, so why was this roll forgotten about? The trend for developing mystery film may speak to something greater about how taking pictures has changed in recent years. Where once photography was time-consuming and the results precious, we now snap everything. Anyone born before the mid-90s recalls the excitement of dropping off their holiday photos at Boots and waiting a week to see the results.

      "body": "<p>\u201cPressure is normal in football. For me it\u2019s not a problem.\u201d Those were the words of Matthijs de Ligt as he was unveiled as Juventus\u2019 ninth \u2013 but most important \u2013 signing on Friday. Juventus had beaten PSG to the signing of the 19-year-old Ajax captain and there is palpable excitement at the club before the new season.</p> <p>And pressure there will be. The feeling is that Juventus finally have a squad strong enough to win the Champions League for the first time since 1996. They have been in two finals in the past five years but lost to Barcelona and Real Madrid.</p> <p>Last season they were eliminated by Ajax at the quarter-final stage and at the end of the campaign, after five years and five Scudettos, the manager, Max Allegri, left. Maurizio Sarri was hired to replace him, an appointment that raised eyebrows because the 60-year-old is arguably as un-Juve as one can possibly get, all tracksuit rather than stylish three-piece and a tie.</p> <p>But the hope is that the squad at Juventus is so good that he can succeed where he, on some levels, failed at Chelsea. The plan is for Juve to play the attractive Sarri-ball seen during the manager\u2019s time at Napoli.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a club that has won so much in the past five years that it will be difficult to emulate that in the next five years statistically,\u201d Sarri said. \u201cThe objective, therefore, must be to forget all the responsibilities and to have fun and to entertain and hopefully combining that by extending the sequence of good results.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b397b940de97c4cb5a5f2ac69bdc9a8792eb50a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b397b940de97c4cb5a5f2ac69bdc9a8792eb50a/574_581_2969_1781/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matthijs de Ligt is welcomed by supporters after his medical.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matthijs de Ligt is welcomed by supporters after his medical.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniele Badolato/Juventus FC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Apart from De Ligt, Juve have signed Adrien Rabiot, Aaron Ramsey, Wesley and Gianluigi Buffon on frees as well as Luca Pellegrini from Roma for \u00a320m, Cristian Romero from Genoa for \u00a323.3m, Merih Demiral from Sassuolo for \u00a316.1m and Luca Zanimacchia from Genoa for \u00a34m this summer.</p> <p>It gives Sarri a remarkably strong squad. In fact, he has such a strong set-up of players he would not mind selling Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, the player he fought so hard to get to Chelsea last season.</p> <p>This is how Sarri\u2019s first-choice XI could look at the start of the season (if Cancelo stays rather than joining Manchester City or Barcelona): Szczesny; Cancelo, De Ligt, Chiellini, Alex Sandro; Ramsey, Pjanic, Rabiot; Douglas Costa, Ronaldo, Dybala.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a5bafcb4c6f0cca149926adb2c14b522e53cb00\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a5bafcb4c6f0cca149926adb2c14b522e53cb00/0_0_920_634/500.jpg\" alt=\"Juventus first-choice XI\" width=\"500\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Juventus first-choice XI</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: x</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And as if that was not impressive enough, this is what his reserve line-up could look like on any given day: Buffon; Cuadrado, Bonucci, Rugani/Demiral, De Sciglio; Emre Can, Bentancur, Matuidi; Bernardeschi, Kean, Mandzukic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"239172dc16396a7892e2e92c671523494169a9e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/239172dc16396a7892e2e92c671523494169a9e4/0_0_925_641/500.jpg\" alt=\"Juventus reserve XI\" width=\"500\" height=\"346\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Juventus reserve XI</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: x</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Aaron Ramsey will have a key role at Sarri\u2019s Juventus. The manager is a huge admirer of the former Arsenal midfielder, a player who can defend, attack and score goals. His starting position will be on the right of a three-man midfield but he could also operate as a No10 if Sarri does the unthinkable and switches to a 4-3-1-2.</p> <p>Miralem Pjanic will be Sarri\u2019s \u201cJorginho\u201d at Juventus. Last summer Sarri told Marina Granovskaia at Chelsea that, if they sold N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, he wanted Pjanic to replace the French midfielder. It did not happen but this season Sarri will be able to use the metronomic skills of the Bosnian midfielder with Adrien Rabiot likely to take the third midfield slot.</p> <p>Up front there is Cristiano Ronaldo. The first thing Sarri did when appointed Juventus manager was to call Ronaldo and arrange to come out to Greece, where the Portuguese was on holiday, to sit down and discuss the coming season.</p> <p>Sarri went on a charm offensive saying how much he admires Ronaldo and told the Portuguese that he would pretty much be able to play where he prefers, whether that is as a No 9 up front or more to the left. Ronaldo has been trying both positions in training with Sarri saying: \u201cWherever you play, you will be my leader and we will play attractive football so that you can score many, many goals.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea8ac30bd91d7f55985b2637cd7a7a23aa898828\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea8ac30bd91d7f55985b2637cd7a7a23aa898828/0_0_3543_2362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cristiano Ronaldo and Joao Cancelo compete during training.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cristiano Ronaldo and Joao Cancelo compete during training.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniele Badolato/Juventus FC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The attractive football is key to the Juve hierarchy and the fans. Allegri was tremendously successful but the football was often insipid. Juve would dominate, then score and then retreat.</p> <p>Sarri knows that a few players, mainly Paulo Dybala and Douglas Costa, were unhappy under Allegri, especially last season, and the new manager is keen to reintegrate them into the starting XI. Both are superb assets if used in the right way and, if Ronaldo plays as a striker, there will be room for both of them to create havoc from the wings.</p> <p>\u201cWith me, quality players will always start. Always,\u201d Sarri said during pre-season. \u201c I\u2019m convinced Paulo Dybala and Douglas Costa can do more than what we\u2019ve seen last season.\u201d</p> <p>There has been a real feeling of happiness around the camp during the summer and they are unlikely to be troubled domestically this season. But therein lies the problem. Juventus\u2019 season will not start properly until February, when the knockout stage of the Champions League begins (if they have qualified of course).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Will all the players be as content as they have been in pre-season by that point? One of the main question marks hanging over Sarri before this season is whether he will be able to rotate his players to keep them all on side. His philosophy has always been to have 11 players who are his starters and then two or three players who come off the bench.</p> <p>That is unlikely to work at Juventus. There are simply too many good players. Last season Allegri changed the team for every single league fixture. Sarri has never done anything like that in his career so will he be able to start now?</p> <p>He has a wonderful squad at his disposal and it will be fascinating to see how he utilises it. His main problem is, perhaps, that it is so good that, if he does not win the Champions League, the season is likely to be regarded as a failure. No pressure then, Maurizio.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cPressure is normal in football. For me it\u2019s not a problem.\u201d Those were the words of Matthijs de Ligt as he was unveiled as Juventus\u2019 ninth \u2013 but most important \u2013 signing on Friday. Juventus had beaten PSG to the signing of the 19-year-old Ajax captain and there is palpable excitement at the club before the new season. And pressure there will be. The feeling is that Juventus finally have a squad strong enough to win the Champions League for the first time since 1996. They have been in two finals in the past five years but lost to Barcelona and Real Madrid. Last season they were eliminated by Ajax at the quarter-final stage and at the end of the campaign, after five years and five Scudettos, the manager, Max Allegri, left. Maurizio Sarri was hired to replace him, an appointment that raised eyebrows because the 60-year-old is arguably as un-Juve as one can possibly get, all tracksuit rather than stylish three-piece and a tie. But the hope is that the squad at Juventus is so good that he can succeed where he, on some levels, failed at Chelsea. The plan is for Juve to play the attractive Sarri-ball seen during the manager\u2019s time at Napoli. \u201cThis is a club that has won so much in the past five years that it will be difficult to emulate that in the next five years statistically,\u201d Sarri said. \u201cThe objective, therefore, must be to forget all the responsibilities and to have fun and to entertain and hopefully combining that by extending the sequence of good results.\u201d Apart from De Ligt, Juve have signed Adrien Rabiot, Aaron Ramsey, Wesley and Gianluigi Buffon on frees as well as Luca Pellegrini from Roma for \u00a320m, Cristian Romero from Genoa for \u00a323.3m, Merih Demiral from Sassuolo for \u00a316.1m and Luca Zanimacchia from Genoa for \u00a34m this summer. It gives Sarri a remarkably strong squad. In fact, he has such a strong set-up of players he would not mind selling Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, the player he fought so hard to get to Chelsea last season. This is how Sarri\u2019s first-choice XI could look at the start of the season (if Cancelo stays rather than joining Manchester City or Barcelona): Szczesny; Cancelo, De Ligt, Chiellini, Alex Sandro; Ramsey, Pjanic, Rabiot; Douglas Costa, Ronaldo, Dybala. And as if that was not impressive enough, this is what his reserve line-up could look like on any given day: Buffon; Cuadrado, Bonucci, Rugani/Demiral, De Sciglio; Emre Can, Bentancur, Matuidi; Bernardeschi, Kean, Mandzukic. Aaron Ramsey will have a key role at Sarri\u2019s Juventus. The manager is a huge admirer of the former Arsenal midfielder, a player who can defend, attack and score goals. His starting position will be on the right of a three-man midfield but he could also operate as a No10 if Sarri does the unthinkable and switches to a 4-3-1-2. Miralem Pjanic will be Sarri\u2019s \u201cJorginho\u201d at Juventus. Last summer Sarri told Marina Granovskaia at Chelsea that, if they sold N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, he wanted Pjanic to replace the French midfielder. It did not happen but this season Sarri will be able to use the metronomic skills of the Bosnian midfielder with Adrien Rabiot likely to take the third midfield slot. Up front there is Cristiano Ronaldo. The first thing Sarri did when appointed Juventus manager was to call Ronaldo and arrange to come out to Greece, where the Portuguese was on holiday, to sit down and discuss the coming season. Sarri went on a charm offensive saying how much he admires Ronaldo and told the Portuguese that he would pretty much be able to play where he prefers, whether that is as a No 9 up front or more to the left. Ronaldo has been trying both positions in training with Sarri saying: \u201cWherever you play, you will be my leader and we will play attractive football so that you can score many, many goals.\u201d The attractive football is key to the Juve hierarchy and the fans. Allegri was tremendously successful but the football was often insipid. Juve would dominate, then score and then retreat. Sarri knows that a few players, mainly Paulo Dybala and Douglas Costa, were unhappy under Allegri, especially last season, and the new manager is keen to reintegrate them into the starting XI. Both are superb assets if used in the right way and, if Ronaldo plays as a striker, there will be room for both of them to create havoc from the wings. \u201cWith me, quality players will always start. Always,\u201d Sarri said during pre-season. \u201c I\u2019m convinced Paulo Dybala and Douglas Costa can do more than what we\u2019ve seen last season.\u201d There has been a real feeling of happiness around the camp during the summer and they are unlikely to be troubled domestically this season. But therein lies the problem. Juventus\u2019 season will not start properly until February, when the knockout stage of the Champions League begins (if they have qualified of course). Will all the players be as content as they have been in pre-season by that point? One of the main question marks hanging over Sarri before this season is whether he will be able to rotate his players to keep them all on side. His philosophy has always been to have 11 players who are his starters and then two or three players who come off the bench. That is unlikely to work at Juventus. There are simply too many good players. Last season Allegri changed the team for every single league fixture. Sarri has never done anything like that in his career so will he be able to start now? He has a wonderful squad at his disposal and it will be fascinating to see how he utilises it. His main problem is, perhaps, that it is so good that, if he does not win the Champions League, the season is likely to be regarded as a failure. No pressure then, Maurizio.",

I don\u2019t think anybody does. You feel you\u2019re doing it for society. I thought I was doing everybody a favour. Everybody was worried about me; what can I say? No one wants to be a source of anxiety to everybody they know. You\u2019re just trouble.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke said that the explosion of punk music chimed with his own poetic ambitions, and that he felt a kinship with the likes of the Sex Pistols. But Clarke says that when the 1980s began his addiction drove him to work for financial incentives.</p> <p>\u201cEvery drug addict is virtually the same person.

      "bodyText": "John Cooper Clarke, the poet and performer who became famous during the punk rock era of the late 1970s, has said he didn\u2019t want to quit taking heroin and weaned himself off the drug for the sake of society rather than for his own health. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Desert Island Discs, Clarke recalled the addiction which dominated much of his life in the 1980s, when he was living in a flat in Brixton, south London, with Nico, the late singer and muse of the Velvet Underground. \u201cWhen I quit I felt really badly done to,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to quit. I don\u2019t think anybody does. You feel you\u2019re doing it for society. I thought I was doing everybody a favour. Everybody was worried about me; what can I say? No one wants to be a source of anxiety to everybody they know. You\u2019re just trouble.\u201d Clarke said that the explosion of punk music chimed with his own poetic ambitions, and that he felt a kinship with the likes of the Sex Pistols. But Clarke says that when the 1980s began his addiction drove him to work for financial incentives. \u201cEvery drug addict is virtually the same person. There\u2019s not really much point in dwelling on it. I needed money more than ever, so I had to work. The glamour was flaking off with every new job. I really felt like I was selling my sorry ass.\u201d Clarke added: \u201cIt was a tedious saying among hippies: if you\u2019re not part of the solution, you\u2019re part of the problem. I was very much part of the problem.\u201d Last year Clarke responded to an Observer reader who asked him whether he had believed he could ever stop using the drug. He said: \u201cIt can be done, clearly, but it ain\u2019t easy. I like to say I did it in two ways: gradually, and suddenly. The fact is you need help, though. My message is always the same: don\u2019t even do it once. \u201cI think it is dangerous to think it is anything to do with having an \u2018addictive personality\u2019 or any of that bollocks.

It must have been around 3am, breakfast time seemingly having been selected by cabin crew who\u2019d gargled with lottery balls and seen what number fell out first.

      "bodyText": "The vivid, poetic nature writing of Robert Macfarlane has touched a sweet spot in the national psyche, making him a bestseller and provoking a groundswell of concern for language, landscape and history. Spell Songs sets Macfarlane\u2019s garlanded The Lost Words to music, with fresh material from the author and illustrator Jackie Morris. Playing and singing is a poly-talented eight-strong ensemble led by Scots singer Karine Polwart, the collective putting together the record during a residency in Grasmere. Several of its songs are, indeed, spells, evocations of Acorn, Heron and Kingfisher set to delicate blends of harp, guitar, cello and kora (courtesy of Senegal\u2019s Seckou Keita). The Snow Hare is a mesmerising vocal duet by Polwart and Julie Fowlis that captures the austere beauty of a winter landscape, while Charm on, Goldfinch, mixing birdsong, whistling and words, makes the bird an emblem of hope.

      "bodyText": "Hidden in a storeroom in the British Museum for the past 146 years and never displayed are 11 remarkable religious objects. They are called tabots \u2013 replica tablets on which the Ten Commandments are written, and which were nicked by the Brits after the battle of Magdala. So sacred are they that they can only be viewed by Ethiopian Orthodox priests. Without wishing to sound facetious, there are not very many such clerics in and around London to see them. Christianity is the largest religion in Ethiopia, and its people place great value in religious items. I mention this because of the resignation, just announced, of the BM trustee Ahdaf Soueif, best known for her Booker-shortlisted The Map of Love. Egyptian-born Soueif cited two key reasons for her departure: the BP sponsorship and the repatriation of objects. The arts sponsorship issue has been well aired. I have more sympathy for the cause of giving back certain objects from UK museums, particularly those which are of enormous emotional and/or spiritual value to their countries of origin. Hartwig Fischer, the BM\u2019s director, has told me he is going to Ethiopia later this year, where he will discuss the tabots, while the museum\u2019s chairman, Richard Lambert, says the BM trustees will take a decision on them \u201cwithin the next six months\u201d, on what would most likely be called a long-term loan . But why not simply make the obvious call, take them out of storage immediately and fly them to Addis Ababa so they can be placed in the relevant churches, permanently? After the huge success on BBC TV of the Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup (the semi-final was seen by 11.7 million viewers, the largest live audience this year), we have had the Netball World Cup this past week. Not, admittedly, given prime time on BBC One like the footie, but each day had at least two hours live on BBC Two. In the UK, more young women play netball than any other sport, while last year, England won gold at the Commonwealth Games. I\u2019ve been watching a bit on TV this past week and thoroughly enjoyed it. No coincidence that the head of BBC Sport is Barbara Slater and BBC\u2019s director of content is Charlotte Moore \u2013 both women. If those posts were occupied by men, I doubt if these sports would have gained nearly as much coverage. Garsington\u2019s opera season closes on Friday with, unusually, three nights of religious music of Monteverdi\u2019s Vespers of 1610. This has been the company\u2019s 30th year; the early operas were in the gardens of Garsington Manor, but, since 2011, they have been performed in an extraordinary transparent pavilion on the Wormsley Estate in Buckinghamshire, owned by Mark Getty. It has been Garsington\u2019s most successful year, with five-star reviews for The Bartered Bride and The Turn of the Screw. The last three nights will be preceded by cricket matches on an adjoining pitch, built by Mark\u2019s father, the cricket-mad Sir John Paul Getty. The most eagerly fought will be between Garsington and the Royal Opera House. I know who I\u2019ll be supporting.",

A coalition of college Republican clubs recently endorsed a tax on carbon pollution. There are other promising signs of middle ground. In response to the violence and death in Charlottesville, Virginia, big donors to the feuding parties, George Soros and David Koch, jointly funded the After Charlottesville Project to curb online calls to violence. The New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the Texas senator Ted Cruz have co-sponsored a congressional bill preventing lawmakers from entering lucrative second careers as corporate lobbyists. Conservatives and liberals united to push for ex-felons in Florida to win the right to vote in 2018, and, this year to push modest but significant reform of our draconian criminal justice laws through Congress. Such cross-party diplomats have not misjudged their opposite number \u2013 such a good lesson for us all. When Martin Luther King marched from Selma to Montgomery, his fellow marchers included a priest, a nun, two rabbis, a Greek Orthodox archbishop and clergy of many Protestant denominations, black and white. In the long run, major political change virtually always requires rising up to cross a bridge \u2013 an urgently needed model for the Democratic party itself today.

      "body": "<p>Greta Thunberg. This time last year she was unimaginable. Then, pretty much from nowhere, there she was: small and slight, a girl just turned 16, the way-too-young odd person out on a panel of adults sitting in front of the world\u2019s economic powers at Davos last January. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2019/jan/25/i-want-you-to-panic-16-year-old-greta-thunberg-issues-climate-warning-at-davos-video\" title=\"\">Unshowy and serious, careful, firm, she said it</a>. Our house is on fire.</p> <p>The ancient Greeks had a word for this: parrhesiastes. It means a person who speaks truth to power: you should not be behaving in this way. Don\u2019t. More specifically it suggests someone in whom directness of expression and access to truth coincide; and it means someone of very little power who\u2019s risking everything \u2013 because they can\u2019t not, there\u2019s no option \u2013 to speak ethical truth to powers so entrenched that they\u2019re close to tyrannical, because telling this truth is about moral law. \u201cSome people, some companies, some decision-makers in particular know exactly what priceless values they have been sacrificing to continue to make unimaginable amounts of money, and I think many of you here today,\u201d she said to the World Economic Forum conference, \u201cbelong to that group of people.\u201d</p> <p>Thunberg is Swedish; she was born in 2003 and lives in Stockholm with her younger sister Beata, her mother, a singer, and her father, an actor. There\u2019s a picture of the family somewhere online taken when she was much younger; her mother and father are smiling broad old-fashioned smiles at the camera \u2013 doing what you do when you have your photo taken. Both the children, only waist- and knee-high, regard the lens with utter seriousness and inquiry. At eight years old, Greta Thunberg heard about climate change. She wondered why no one was doing anything to stop it. At 11 she stopped speaking, in protest; now she sees that \u201cselective mutism\u201d as the first step to understanding the power and necessity of speaking at all.</p> <p>She was 15 when she began taking days off her education to sit in front of the Riksdag in Stockholm, declaring she\u2019d do this till Sweden reduced carbon emissions in line with the Paris agreement. She gave out leaflets: \u201cI am doing this because you adults are shitting on my future.\u201d She made a couple of speeches internationally that tapped into a profound unspoken understanding in young people; in just six months, nearly one and a half million children across the world were schoolstriking for action on climate change. Her Instagram post on these strikes reads: \u201cTime is much shorter than we think. Failure means disaster. The grown-ups have failed us. And since most of them, including the press and the politicians, keep ignoring the situation, we must take action into our own hands. Starting today. Everyone is welcome. Everyone is needed. Please join in.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this month Opec declared Thunberg, and with her the other young climate activists, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/05/biggest-compliment-yet-greta-thunberg-welcomes-oil-chiefs-greatest-threat-label\" title=\"\">the \u201cgreatest threat\u201d to the fossil fuel industry</a>. Thunberg <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GretaThunberg/status/1146700304219553792\" title=\"\">tweeted them</a> her thanks. \u201cOur biggest compliment yet.\u201d Hers is a voice totally unlike the world\u2019s usual power-cacophony: clean, simple, inclusive, the voice of someone refusing to beguile. She talks ethics to politics without flinching. She cuts through the media white noise and political rabble-rousing to get to the essentials. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/28/generation-greta-young-climate-activists-around-world\" title=\"\">This is a communal voice and Thunberg is its lightning conductor</a>, and no wonder: when you hear her speak or you read her speeches you know you\u2019re in the presence of the opposite of cynicism \u2013 of a spirit, in fact, that rebuffs cynicism and knows that the way we act, every single one of us, has transformatory impact and consequence. \u201cThe real power belongs to the people.\u201d</p> <p>This voice lets us know we\u2019re in disavowal, and that we\u2019d better wake up. Then it tells us, clear as anything, how to do this. <strong>Ali Smith</strong></p> <h2>Questions from famous fans</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ac8ad2919ba955f50e34abdc2a263430983d5cbd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac8ad2919ba955f50e34abdc2a263430983d5cbd/74_0_728_708/500.jpg\" alt=\"Maisie Williams\" width=\"500\" height=\"486\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/14/maisie-williams-i-was-covered-in-blood-and-gnawing-on-pizza\" title=\"\">Maisie Williams</a></strong></h2> <p><strong>Actor</strong></p> <p><strong>What can people reading this</strong><strong> do today to make an impact?</strong><br>A great start is to inform yourself. To read and try to understand the problem. It is very depressing but absolutely necessary. Once you fully realise the situation then you will know what to do. And then spread that information to others. Then there are lots of things you can do in your everyday life. Going vegan, stop flying and have shop-stop for instance. Of course we need a system change. But I believe that you cannot have system change without individual change. In today\u2019s debate climate, a lot of people will not listen to you unless you practise as you preach and live by example. And we need everyone to listen. So making some personal changes is very much worth it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f0f69871335821cfde53f18e804ef2e3d9b0d271\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0f69871335821cfde53f18e804ef2e3d9b0d271/56_0_733_708/500.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn\" width=\"500\" height=\"483\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn\" title=\"\">Jeremy Corbyn MP</a></strong></h2> <p><strong>Leader of the Labour party</strong></p> <p><strong>How will young people today have to live and work differently in the future because of climate change?</strong><br>In the global north the immediate differences may not be very striking. But we need to rapidly remove all fossil fuels from our everyday life and leave them in the ground. This is what most politicians do not seem to understand. Lowering emissions is not enough. In the global south, however, people already are very much affected. There is an ongoing catastrophe in many parts of the world. And this is already affecting hundreds of millions. There will of course be lots of benefits to changing to a green economy. But we must remember that this is above all an emergency \u2013 not primarily an opportunity to create new green economic growth. We need a whole new way of thinking.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"aa7c344aed84a42befa7d438b869e2794145c845\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa7c344aed84a42befa7d438b869e2794145c845/35_0_733_708/500.jpg\" alt=\"Jameela Jamil\" width=\"500\" height=\"483\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/28/jameela-jamil-wont-become-double-agent-patriarchy\" title=\"\">Jameela Jamil</a></strong></h2> <p><strong>Actor and campaigner</strong></p> <p><strong>How can we most effectively and efficiently support you and your amazing work?

But under the wrong circumstances we can be very selfish and greedy, like now. People can be taught to be good, or bad. I think we all need help to focus on the right things to do. With more than 7 billion people on the planet, we need to cooperate. I don\u2019t believe we are continuing to ruin the biosphere because we are evil.

Also, being young is a great advantage since we see the world from a new perspective and we are not afraid to make radical changes. </p> <p><strong>As a biology teacher I support your actions because I view the planet from the perspective of ecology. I would like to draw your attention to two important graphs that can be seen online based on the present scientific evidence available</strong><strong>. The first is human population growth v global warming and the second is human population growth v extinctions. Both have near perfect positive correlations. So do you think we have a responsibility to manage population growth to save the planet?</strong><br><strong>Colin Pascoe, Bath</strong><br>The problem is not the people. It is what we do. But of course it is more difficult to live sustainably with more people on the planet. But these solutions can never be discussed on a personal level \u2013 it must be handled on a global level. If we are to control the number of people on Earth then I guess we must start with the high emitters. This debate would take decades and leave no space to solve other problems. It\u2019s simply too big for us individuals. In my experience, the \u201cwe are too many people\u201d argument is used as an excuse for not taking action ourselves. Whether we start controlling births or not, we need to get to zero emissions.</p> <p><strong>How do we get the message across in countries like China and Russia, which do not have the open </strong><strong>media that we have?</strong><br><strong>John Telling, Tunbridge Wells</strong><br>We do what we can do. I, for instance, can\u2019t vote in China or Russia. Nor do I control media in China or Russia. I can only do what I can. And if enough people stand up for the climate and the environment, that will eventually spread to other countries. Perhaps even to China and Russia. We must focus on what we can do. Not what we can\u2019t do.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb797e106e6cb7b4fc60447b88148f08ec4899a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb797e106e6cb7b4fc60447b88148f08ec4899a7/0_160_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Discussing cross-party action in Westminster with Michael Gove, Ed Miliband and Caroline Lucas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Discussing cross-party action in Westminster with Michael Gove, Layla Moran, Ed Miliband and Caroline Lucas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>I am an old man without children.

      "bodyText": "Greta Thunberg. This time last year she was unimaginable. Then, pretty much from nowhere, there she was: small and slight, a girl just turned 16, the way-too-young odd person out on a panel of adults sitting in front of the world\u2019s economic powers at Davos last January. Unshowy and serious, careful, firm, she said it. Our house is on fire. The ancient Greeks had a word for this: parrhesiastes. It means a person who speaks truth to power: you should not be behaving in this way. Don\u2019t. More specifically it suggests someone in whom directness of expression and access to truth coincide; and it means someone of very little power who\u2019s risking everything \u2013 because they can\u2019t not, there\u2019s no option \u2013 to speak ethical truth to powers so entrenched that they\u2019re close to tyrannical, because telling this truth is about moral law. \u201cSome people, some companies, some decision-makers in particular know exactly what priceless values they have been sacrificing to continue to make unimaginable amounts of money, and I think many of you here today,\u201d she said to the World Economic Forum conference, \u201cbelong to that group of people.\u201d Thunberg is Swedish; she was born in 2003 and lives in Stockholm with her younger sister Beata, her mother, a singer, and her father, an actor. There\u2019s a picture of the family somewhere online taken when she was much younger; her mother and father are smiling broad old-fashioned smiles at the camera \u2013 doing what you do when you have your photo taken. Both the children, only waist- and knee-high, regard the lens with utter seriousness and inquiry. At eight years old, Greta Thunberg heard about climate change. She wondered why no one was doing anything to stop it. At 11 she stopped speaking, in protest; now she sees that \u201cselective mutism\u201d as the first step to understanding the power and necessity of speaking at all. She was 15 when she began taking days off her education to sit in front of the Riksdag in Stockholm, declaring she\u2019d do this till Sweden reduced carbon emissions in line with the Paris agreement. She gave out leaflets: \u201cI am doing this because you adults are shitting on my future.\u201d She made a couple of speeches internationally that tapped into a profound unspoken understanding in young people; in just six months, nearly one and a half million children across the world were schoolstriking for action on climate change. Her Instagram post on these strikes reads: \u201cTime is much shorter than we think. Failure means disaster. The grown-ups have failed us. And since most of them, including the press and the politicians, keep ignoring the situation, we must take action into our own hands. Starting today. Everyone is welcome. Everyone is needed. Please join in.\u201d Earlier this month Opec declared Thunberg, and with her the other young climate activists, the \u201cgreatest threat\u201d to the fossil fuel industry. Thunberg tweeted them her thanks. \u201cOur biggest compliment yet.\u201d Hers is a voice totally unlike the world\u2019s usual power-cacophony: clean, simple, inclusive, the voice of someone refusing to beguile. She talks ethics to politics without flinching. She cuts through the media white noise and political rabble-rousing to get to the essentials. This is a communal voice and Thunberg is its lightning conductor, and no wonder: when you hear her speak or you read her speeches you know you\u2019re in the presence of the opposite of cynicism \u2013 of a spirit, in fact, that rebuffs cynicism and knows that the way we act, every single one of us, has transformatory impact and consequence. \u201cThe real power belongs to the people.\u201d This voice lets us know we\u2019re in disavowal, and that we\u2019d better wake up. Then it tells us, clear as anything, how to do this. Ali Smith Questions from famous fans Maisie Williams Actor What can people reading this do today to make an impact? A great start is to inform yourself. To read and try to understand the problem. It is very depressing but absolutely necessary. Once you fully realise the situation then you will know what to do. And then spread that information to others. Then there are lots of things you can do in your everyday life. Going vegan, stop flying and have shop-stop for instance. Of course we need a system change. But I believe that you cannot have system change without individual change. In today\u2019s debate climate, a lot of people will not listen to you unless you practise as you preach and live by example. And we need everyone to listen. So making some personal changes is very much worth it. Jeremy Corbyn MP Leader of the Labour party How will young people today have to live and work differently in the future because of climate change? In the global north the immediate differences may not be very striking. But we need to rapidly remove all fossil fuels from our everyday life and leave them in the ground. This is what most politicians do not seem to understand. Lowering emissions is not enough. In the global south, however, people already are very much affected. There is an ongoing catastrophe in many parts of the world. And this is already affecting hundreds of millions. There will of course be lots of benefits to changing to a green economy. But we must remember that this is above all an emergency \u2013 not primarily an opportunity to create new green economic growth. We need a whole new way of thinking. Jameela Jamil Actor and campaigner How can we most effectively and efficiently support you and your amazing work? (PS: Thank you for your efforts, you\u2019re the most inspiring person.) Activism seems to be working. So I would encourage people to become activists. And if you have a big platform, then highlight the crisis and communicate the information. There will be general, global climate strikes on 20 and 27 September. We need everyone to participate in these. Even adults and unions and so on. And of course we do this every Friday. Everyone is welcome to join. Simon Armitage Poet laureate Environmentally speaking, what has been humankind\u2019s most catastrophic invention? I don\u2019t think there is one singular worst invention. It is all of them combined with our current systems. But the idea that we can dig up astronomical amounts of fossilised, compressed biomass and burn it in the atmosphere without consequences is pretty catastrophic. And also the thought of eternal economic growth on a planet with limited resources. Lily Cole Model and campaigner Do you have any sense of what job you would like to do in future \u2013 would you be interested in going into politics, for example? I think I would like work where I feel most needed. I would love to study science but the scientific facts are already there. We now need to communicate those facts and then [take] political action. The politics of today don\u2019t interest me much, however. It\u2019s all about competing, and it\u2019s more important how you say something \u2013 the way you say it \u2013 than the content of what you actually are saying. That has to change. Sigrid Singer and songwriter Do you ever feel overwhelmed with the huge following you now have? (PS: You are such a remarkable person, and even though things are looking pretty dark, I do hope that you take some time to be proud of how many people you have engaged with your words. Well done!) Yes, of course. What has happened during the past few months is very hard to grasp. I would never have expected anything close to this. David Lammy Labour MP for Tottenham Can you be politically conservative, ie on the political right, pro-growth, pro-capitalism and pro the for-profit motive, and still support the climate change movement and green issues? That is not for me to say. I am only communicating the scientific facts. This question is probably not possible to answer without personal opinion and I leave that to others. But I think we can safely say that all ideologies have failed. If some have failed more than others then that is for others to say. Stewart Lee Comedian You are my new hero and you have really helped me to explain what is going on to my children. How do you keep so calm when people use personal attacks to try and undermine your work? I had expected that. If you don\u2019t fully understand the ongoing climate breakdown, then what I and the other school strikers do must seem very strange\u2026 and since most people are not aware, this is unfortunately what I expected. And I don\u2019t think I can do much about it. Even if I would constantly prove them wrong with facts and arguments, they would make up new things to attack the climate movement or me. But I think that as long as they go after me personally with insults and conspiracy theories then that is good. It proves that they don\u2019t have any arguments. And that they see us as a threat because we are having an impact. Rutger Bregman Historian and author Do you think human beings are generally selfish and focused on their own needs, or do you believe human beings are naturally cooperative, empathetic and creative? Or something in between? And does your view of humanity determine your activism? I don\u2019t believe humans are naturally evil. But under the wrong circumstances we can be very selfish and greedy, like now. People can be taught to be good, or bad. I think we all need help to focus on the right things to do. With more than 7 billion people on the planet, we need to cooperate. I don\u2019t believe we are continuing to ruin the biosphere because we are evil. I am convinced we are doing it because we are not fully informed of the consequences of our actions. And this is very hopeful to me, because I believe that once we know we will change. This has a huge impact on my activism, because people are adaptable and the changes necessary are not impossible. Jane Goodall Founder of the Jane Goodall Institute and UN messenger of peace The Jane Goodall Institute\u2019s Roots &amp; Shoots programme involves thousands of young people of all ages in roughly 60 countries. Hundreds of groups are working on projects in connection with the climate crisis. Do you think it is important that young people roll up their sleeves and take action in addition to marching? If so, what would you suggest? Yes, everything is needed. There are thousands of ways to take action. For example, plant trees, pick up litter, join an organisation or movement that makes a difference and especially try to influence adults and put pressure on people in power. I started my activism at home, changing my parents\u2019 and relatives\u2019 habits and ways of thinking. Questions from readers Do you have days when you feel \u201cthere\u2019s no hope, we\u2019re doomed\u201d? If so, where do you get the motivation to keep fighting? Ali B Kord, Sydney, Australia Yeah, you have no idea\u2026 But that\u2019s not a reason to quit. We must never give up. I have made up my mind and decided to never, ever give up. I\u2019ve worked in the environmental sector for the past five years. I have gone vegetarian, barely fly (and offset when I do), and cycle to work every day. The problem is I often find it impossible to make others understand the severity of the situation. Any tips on how to effectively persuade people? Craig Blyth-Moore, Edinburgh I think a combination of activism works. If more and more people start behaving like we are in a crisis, more people will understand. People in poverty have little or no concept of climate change because they are busy just surviving. How do we reach the parts of society like this? Mike Jarrey, Ghent, Belgium Good question. I think we must make them realise that climate-related issues are the key to other issues as well. Such as equality and social injustice and human rights. The climate issue offers a solid, science-supported black or white issue. The sooner other movements realise this, the better. You\u2019ve called for a global general climate strike on 20 September. What do you think about the possibility of a continuous general strike and the impacts it could have on global business-as-usual? Thomas Kane, Stockport We children are calling for the adults to join us on 20 and 27 September. To have real impact we must get to the stage where we have continuous general strikes. That will have an enormous impact on business-as-usual. We must get there soon. It would open people\u2019s eyes and put things in perspective. I\u2019m 21 and I am facing a lot of ageism. I am discriminated against and invalidated because of my age. I\u2019m told I don\u2019t understand \u201chow the world works\u201d, and that my experiences don\u2019t count. How do you push back against ageism and keep raising your voice? Gayane Aghabalyan, Yerevan, Armenia I don\u2019t care about age. Nor do I care about those who do not accept the science. I don\u2019t have as much experience, and therefore I listen more. But I also have the right to express my opinion, no matter my age. Also, being young is a great advantage since we see the world from a new perspective and we are not afraid to make radical changes. As a biology teacher I support your actions because I view the planet from the perspective of ecology. I would like to draw your attention to two important graphs that can be seen online based on the present scientific evidence available. The first is human population growth v global warming and the second is human population growth v extinctions. Both have near perfect positive correlations. So do you think we have a responsibility to manage population growth to save the planet? Colin Pascoe, Bath The problem is not the people. It is what we do. But of course it is more difficult to live sustainably with more people on the planet. But these solutions can never be discussed on a personal level \u2013 it must be handled on a global level. If we are to control the number of people on Earth then I guess we must start with the high emitters. This debate would take decades and leave no space to solve other problems. It\u2019s simply too big for us individuals. In my experience, the \u201cwe are too many people\u201d argument is used as an excuse for not taking action ourselves. Whether we start controlling births or not, we need to get to zero emissions. How do we get the message across in countries like China and Russia, which do not have the open media that we have? John Telling, Tunbridge Wells We do what we can do. I, for instance, can\u2019t vote in China or Russia. Nor do I control media in China or Russia. I can only do what I can. And if enough people stand up for the climate and the environment, that will eventually spread to other countries. Perhaps even to China and Russia. We must focus on what we can do. Not what we can\u2019t do. I am an old man without children. Why should I care about what happens to the planet after my death? Confundido, online, name not supplied Maybe you believe in something? Like karma, faith? Or morality? Or just because it\u2019s the right thing to do. How do you explain that, despite the findings of scientists and the alarming UN report, some people keep on denying or ignoring the climate crisis? mdivet, online I don\u2019t believe so much in denial. I think either you don\u2019t fully understand or you don\u2019t accept the facts. This is because the facts just don\u2019t fit your idea of how things are or should be.

      "body": "<p>If you wanted to put the popularity of women\u2019s football into figures then the most impressive one is 11.7 million. That\u2019s the number of people in the UK who watched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/02/usa-england-womens-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">England\u2019s World Cup semi-final against the USA</a> on TV. In these days of multi-channels and platforms that is properly large, suggesting that, at least at the international level, women\u2019s football has captured not just the public\u2019s attention but also its imagination.</p> \n<p>Of course, that is not to say that it is going to rival men\u2019s football anytime soon, but it does say a few other things. From being viewed as a joke or a kind of pathetic imitation of the men\u2019s game, women\u2019s football has gradually gained respect among women <em>and</em> men. Having ranked as an obscure curiosity, it has established mainstream appeal. And from being subject to the casual and sometimes premeditated sexism that has dominated the sport, women\u2019s football has forged a basis for equality.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/15/sporting-sunday-britain-olympic-spirit-2012-cricket-world-cup\">A golden sporting Sunday to make Britain appreciate its better self | Richard Williams</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Not equality of pay or celebrity but in terms of performance. After all, the Women\u2019s World Cup featured the same rules and regulations as any men\u2019s football tournament. There was no lighter load or lesser demand. And that\u2019s something from which a sport that has led the way in fighting the female cause could learn a lesson.</p> \n<p>Back in the dark days of sporting sexism, when women were seen primarily as genteel amateurs or competitors to be judged by their appearance, women\u2019s tennis was the crucible of what was to be a long and largely victorious battle to gain parity with male players. This was the era of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/dec/01/battle-of-the-sexes-billie-jean-king-bobby-riggs-wta\" title=\"\">so-called Battle of the Sexes</a>, the name given to the 1973 televised exhibition matches between the 55-year-old former world No 1 Bobby Riggs and women\u2019s champion Billie Jean King.</p> \n<p>As the recent Hollywood film based on the clash put it, Riggs intended to put the show back into chauvinism. \u201cThe best way to handle women is to keep them pregnant and barefoot,\u201d he announced. In the event King won what was a bizarre spectacle, but perhaps more importantly she played a key role in helping to organise women\u2019s players so they could achieve financial parity with the men\u2019s game.</p> \n<p>Speed forward a few decades and at Wimbledon this year the winner of the men\u2019s title Novak Djokovic earned \u00a32.3m, while the winner of the women\u2019s title Simona Halep got exactly the same amount. It has been a principle for a number of years now that there is no difference in men\u2019s and women\u2019s pay at the top of tennis. So normalised has it become that to question the policy is to immediately occupy the misogynistic position \u2013 and who but some unreconstructed neanderthal wants to do that?</p> \n<p>Well, here goes: there <em>is</em> something wrong about equal pay, at least in the four grand slam tournaments. The problem was exemplified in this year\u2019s respective Wimbledon singles finals. Djokovic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/novak-djokovic-roger-federer-wimbledon-mens-final-match-report\" title=\"\">took four hours and 57 minutes</a> to beat Roger Federer in an epic match that tested every aspect of the two competitors: skill, stamina, mental strength, you name it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"020d9b07590614b17768e2adbbd27e97b99146a7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/020d9b07590614b17768e2adbbd27e97b99146a7/0_196_3221_1932/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simona Halep\u2019s final victory over Serena Williams took under an hour\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simona Halep\u2019s final victory over Serena Williams took under an hour.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karwai Tang/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Halep, by contrast, finished her match against Serena Williams <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/13/simona-halep-stuns-serena-williams-to-win-first-wimbledon-title\" title=\"\">in just 56 minutes</a>. That is more than four hours less time than the men\u2019s final. The Romanian played the match of her life and deserved to win. But still, 56 minutes? You don\u2019t book Centre Court by the hour. One reason for the disparity is that in grand slam events, men play the best of five sets. But the women play the same as they do in any other tournament on the circuit: the best of three sets.</p> \n<p>The question is why? Do they lack the stamina to go five sets? As professional women\u2019s tennis players are superb athletes, and women are perfectly capable of running marathons or playing 90 minutes plus injury time and extra time in football, then the answer has to be no.

      "bodyText": "If you wanted to put the popularity of women\u2019s football into figures then the most impressive one is 11.7 million. That\u2019s the number of people in the UK who watched England\u2019s World Cup semi-final against the USA on TV. In these days of multi-channels and platforms that is properly large, suggesting that, at least at the international level, women\u2019s football has captured not just the public\u2019s attention but also its imagination. Of course, that is not to say that it is going to rival men\u2019s football anytime soon, but it does say a few other things. From being viewed as a joke or a kind of pathetic imitation of the men\u2019s game, women\u2019s football has gradually gained respect among women and men. Having ranked as an obscure curiosity, it has established mainstream appeal. And from being subject to the casual and sometimes premeditated sexism that has dominated the sport, women\u2019s football has forged a basis for equality. Not equality of pay or celebrity but in terms of performance. After all, the Women\u2019s World Cup featured the same rules and regulations as any men\u2019s football tournament. There was no lighter load or lesser demand. And that\u2019s something from which a sport that has led the way in fighting the female cause could learn a lesson. Back in the dark days of sporting sexism, when women were seen primarily as genteel amateurs or competitors to be judged by their appearance, women\u2019s tennis was the crucible of what was to be a long and largely victorious battle to gain parity with male players. This was the era of the so-called Battle of the Sexes, the name given to the 1973 televised exhibition matches between the 55-year-old former world No 1 Bobby Riggs and women\u2019s champion Billie Jean King. As the recent Hollywood film based on the clash put it, Riggs intended to put the show back into chauvinism. \u201cThe best way to handle women is to keep them pregnant and barefoot,\u201d he announced. In the event King won what was a bizarre spectacle, but perhaps more importantly she played a key role in helping to organise women\u2019s players so they could achieve financial parity with the men\u2019s game. Speed forward a few decades and at Wimbledon this year the winner of the men\u2019s title Novak Djokovic earned \u00a32.3m, while the winner of the women\u2019s title Simona Halep got exactly the same amount. It has been a principle for a number of years now that there is no difference in men\u2019s and women\u2019s pay at the top of tennis. So normalised has it become that to question the policy is to immediately occupy the misogynistic position \u2013 and who but some unreconstructed neanderthal wants to do that? Well, here goes: there is something wrong about equal pay, at least in the four grand slam tournaments. The problem was exemplified in this year\u2019s respective Wimbledon singles finals. Djokovic took four hours and 57 minutes to beat Roger Federer in an epic match that tested every aspect of the two competitors: skill, stamina, mental strength, you name it. Halep, by contrast, finished her match against Serena Williams in just 56 minutes. That is more than four hours less time than the men\u2019s final. The Romanian played the match of her life and deserved to win. But still, 56 minutes? You don\u2019t book Centre Court by the hour. One reason for the disparity is that in grand slam events, men play the best of five sets. But the women play the same as they do in any other tournament on the circuit: the best of three sets. The question is why? Do they lack the stamina to go five sets? As professional women\u2019s tennis players are superb athletes, and women are perfectly capable of running marathons or playing 90 minutes plus injury time and extra time in football, then the answer has to be no. Three years ago Djokovic got into hot water when he protested that men should be paid more than women\u2019s tennis players. Noting that it was a delicate subject, he began his argument by stating that he supported women\u2019s fight for equal pay. \u201cI applaud them for that, I honestly do. They fought for what they deserve and they got it.\u201d But rather like those misleading moments on court when the Serb looks as if he\u2019s about to collapse, Djokovic was not finished. \u201cOn the other hand, I think that our men\u2019s tennis world, ATP world, should fight for more because the stats are showing that we have much more spectators on the men\u2019s tennis matches,\u201d he concluded. That seems like a rather crude argument to me, and also one that could easily be reversed if a popular group of women players were to emerge and Federer, Nadal and co finally retire. So it was no surprise that Djokovic appeared as if he wanted to resurrect the old men-favouring status quo. However, whisper it softly, at the very top of the women\u2019s game, less is required of the players and, as a consequence, it makes for less compelling competition. Now you can say many things about the women\u2019s football World Cup but it certainly delivered in terms of human drama. There was the same kind of exertion and near exhaustion for the players as you see in the male version. Unless there is a global political revolution in the offing, then equal pay in football is about as likely as the Faroe Islands winning the World Cup (men\u2019s or women\u2019s). But at least you can make the argument in the abstract on the perfectly valid grounds that they are doing the same job. You can\u2019t do that in tennis, not in the grand slam competitions that matter most. And that ill-serves the case for parity. Equal pay for equal work is a noble rallying cry. But it\u2019s not one that can be used in good faith in tennis at the moment. Riggs, that clown prince of chauvinism, once identified what he saw as the trouble with the women\u2019s game. \u201cThose women think they\u2019re men, and they go off hitting all over the place,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019d be better off if they\u2019d played like women.\u201d The irony is that having beaten him, women\u2019s tennis continues to take his advice.",

Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s Premier League side finished seventh last season and reached an FA Cup semi-final. It\u2019s always hard to compare one era with another</em><em> but how do the current team measure up?</em></p> <p><strong>Mel Eves </strong>You say about comparisons but when we played we were always compared with the 50s team: \u2018Oh, you\u2019re not as good as Jimmy Mullen and Billy Wright.\u2019</p> <p>We did have to live with that. But I actually think that this team compares favourably. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as good as the early 70s team, which I was fortunate to play in, when we got to the Uefa Cup final. But they\u2019ve got the potential and the resources to get to that sort of level and hopefully take it further.</p> <p><strong>SJ</strong><em> Wolves won the League Cup in 1974 and again in 1980, when John Barnwell was manager and Andy Gray had signed for a British record fee of \u00a31.469m. Take us back to that time.</em></p> <p><strong>Eves </strong>If we had our 11 best players out, we could take on anybody. We just lacked a little bit of consistency, otherwise we would have pushed that [1979-80] season to be even better than sixth.</p> <p>And, of course, that was the time we beat Forest to win the League Cup.</p> <p><strong>Eves </strong>They were the European Cup holders.</p> <p>I felt when Barny and Richie [Barker, the assistant manager] came, they played to a system that suited us and that\u2019s why we did well.

      "body": "<p>For Theresa May, the worst has been saved for last. After taking her final prime minister\u2019s questions, she will be driven to Buckingham Palace on Wednesday afternoon to perform the most personally disagreeable task of her time at the top. After tendering her resignation, which will be painful enough, she will have the even more hateful duty of recommending that the Queen invites Boris Johnson to become the new prime minister.</p> <p>Her failings have been a major contributory factor to his ascent. Tory activists think he will deliver them the Brexit that she couldn\u2019t and cheer them up after the torture of the May years. Tory MPs believe that he has the campaign skills to scupper Nigel Farage and squash Jeremy Corbyn. None of which is going to be much use to him in the critical opening weeks of a premiership that will inherit all the problems that defeated Mrs May and with some extra challenges of his own.</p> <p>He will have to learn how to be prime minister. The schoolboy who wanted to be \u201cworld king\u201d has spent many years lusting after the job, but that is entirely different to doing it. Many previous tenants of Number 10 will testify that no other role is an adequate preparation for the demands of the premiership. Tony Blair, a highly accomplished leader of the opposition before he moved into Downing Street, once told me that he didn\u2019t really get the hang of it until he had been doing it for four years and he had the shock absorber of a landslide majority while he was learning on the job. Gordon Brown arrived with a decade as chancellor under his belt, but floundered desperately as prime minister. Boris Johnson has never been in charge of a public service department and was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/15/lord-carrington-boris-johnson-brexit-absence-of-honour-brink-of-catastrophe\" title=\"\">an embarrassment</a> in the one cabinet position that he has held.</p> <p>The optimistic forecast of a Johnson premiership argues that he understands his own frailties and will surround himself with sensible people who know how to make things work. They point to his time as London mayor, but that experience is distant and not all that relevant. He and the City Hall veterans he will take into Downing Street will soon learn the difference between wielding circumscribed powers over one city and taking total responsibility for the fortunes of a deeply divided nation at one of the most perilous junctures of its modern history.</p> <p>The civil service is paid to help and will usually look forward to an exhausted premiership being replaced by a fresh one. Contrary to some popular tropes, civil servants respond well to purposeful political leadership.

      "bodyText": "For Theresa May, the worst has been saved for last. After taking her final prime minister\u2019s questions, she will be driven to Buckingham Palace on Wednesday afternoon to perform the most personally disagreeable task of her time at the top. After tendering her resignation, which will be painful enough, she will have the even more hateful duty of recommending that the Queen invites Boris Johnson to become the new prime minister. Her failings have been a major contributory factor to his ascent. Tory activists think he will deliver them the Brexit that she couldn\u2019t and cheer them up after the torture of the May years. Tory MPs believe that he has the campaign skills to scupper Nigel Farage and squash Jeremy Corbyn. None of which is going to be much use to him in the critical opening weeks of a premiership that will inherit all the problems that defeated Mrs May and with some extra challenges of his own. He will have to learn how to be prime minister. The schoolboy who wanted to be \u201cworld king\u201d has spent many years lusting after the job, but that is entirely different to doing it. Many previous tenants of Number 10 will testify that no other role is an adequate preparation for the demands of the premiership. Tony Blair, a highly accomplished leader of the opposition before he moved into Downing Street, once told me that he didn\u2019t really get the hang of it until he had been doing it for four years and he had the shock absorber of a landslide majority while he was learning on the job. Gordon Brown arrived with a decade as chancellor under his belt, but floundered desperately as prime minister. Boris Johnson has never been in charge of a public service department and was an embarrassment in the one cabinet position that he has held. The optimistic forecast of a Johnson premiership argues that he understands his own frailties and will surround himself with sensible people who know how to make things work. They point to his time as London mayor, but that experience is distant and not all that relevant. He and the City Hall veterans he will take into Downing Street will soon learn the difference between wielding circumscribed powers over one city and taking total responsibility for the fortunes of a deeply divided nation at one of the most perilous junctures of its modern history. The civil service is paid to help and will usually look forward to an exhausted premiership being replaced by a fresh one. Contrary to some popular tropes, civil servants respond well to purposeful political leadership. In this case, though, Whitehall is preparing for the Johnson premiership by adopting the brace position. Is this because he is infamously cavalier about detail, bored by complexity, known to react peevishly and sometimes with a ferocious temper when frustrated or contradicted, and has a notoriously casual relationship with the truth? All that and more. The core fear about a Johnson premiership is that officials will not feel confident that they can speak truth to power.

This year also sees a new Tour of Scotland in August. If ASO does not make a move very rapidly, there may well be no calendar space for its major event.</p> \n<p>The development may also be a reaction to criticism of ASO\u2019s attitude to women\u2019s cycling. The company was impressed enough to found La Course in 2014 after an online petition calling for the resumption of a women\u2019s Tour de France drew almost 100,000 signatures and it must have noticed the reaction to the lack of television coverage this spring of its Ardennes Classics, Fl\u00e8che Wallonne and Li\u00e8ge-Bastogne-Li\u00e8ge.

      "bodyText": "Standing on a balcony at the New Imperial Hotel, overlooking Jaffa Gate in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City, 75-year-old Walid Dajani last week declared a one-man war on Jewish settlers. Officials from Israel\u2019s supreme court had served an eviction notice against Dajani following a ruling last month that the disputed 2005 sale of the historic 40-room hotel to a radical settler group was valid. The Jewish settlers\u2019 organisation Ateret Cohanim immediately branded him \u201ca squatter\u201d and threatened to seize the building. Such a move would establish a strategically valuable settler presence just inside Jaffa Gate, the main entrance to the ancient city\u2019s Christian Quarter.

      "body": "<p>Coddington Court, near the Herefordshire market town of Ledbury, is a late-18th-century red brick mansion surrounded by farmland.</p> <p>These days it goes by the name of<a href=\"https://adhisthana.org\" title=\"\"> Adhisthana, reflecting</a> its reincarnation as the headquarters of one of the most influential Buddhist orders in the world, the Triratna Community, whose founder, Sangharakshita, lived there until his death last year at the age of 93. With its impressive grounds and gardens, it looks like a serene place for someone to spend their final years. But behind the scenes, the picture is a rather more turbulent one.</p> <p>For decades the order has been dogged by claims of sexual misconduct, claims that often strayed into allegations of coercion and abuse but which were thought to involve only a handful of individuals at worst.</p> <p>But now a bombshell internal report, produced by concerned members and shared with the <em>Observer</em>, has found that more than one in 10 of them claim to have experienced or observed sexual misconduct while in the order. Many of the allegations are against Sangharakshita himself, but others make it clear that he was not the only alleged perpetrator. Indeed, the report seems to indicate that the licentious culture the guru encouraged when he established his first centre in the 1960s, at a time when Timothy Leary was urging people to \u201cturn on, tune in, drop out\u201d, flourished across the order.</p> <p>Yet, despite the lurid revelations, Sangharakshita\u2019s influence lingers. The Adhisthana website carries many pictures of him, a bespectacled, slight man draped in holy robes. The photographs invite comparisons with Gandhi, but the two gurus come from very different backgrounds.</p> <p>Born Dennis Lingwood, the son of a French polisher from Tooting, Sangharakshita, meaning \u201cone who is protected by the spiritual community\u201d, deserted from the British army in India during the second world war and wandered the subcontinent, studying with several leading Tibetan lamas.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1cf9e567eeb17600119791014a4b0fa18afe64cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cf9e567eeb17600119791014a4b0fa18afe64cb/300_0_1000_600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adhisthana (formerly Coddington Court) in Herefordshire is the headquarters of the Triratna Community.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adhisthana (formerly Coddington Court) in Herefordshire is the headquarters of the Triratna Community.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two decades on, he returned to London at the invitation of a group of Buddhists in Hampstead, with a mission to set up one of Britain\u2019s first monasteries, before leaving for reasons that are disputed. Some claim that he was caught using rent boys, an allegation that the Triratna community said it had not heard before. At the time of his departure, the Hampstead group issued a statement that said: \u201cWhatever may have been said to the detriment of his character in the course of recent speculation and gossip may now be withdrawn.\u201d</p> <p>Venturing out on his own, Lingwood developed his own, highly interpretative brand of Buddhism, drawing on elements of Nietzsche and Freud. Critics would accuse him of a pushing a \u201csemi-intellectual potpourri of Buddhism\u201d but he shrugged off the attacks, claiming he was helping the religion find new followers in the west.</p> <p>Many of his ideas were unorthodox. Lingwood encouraged heterosexual followers to experiment with homosexuality as a means of expanding their minds; he was deeply critical of the nuclear family and of mixed-sex communities in general; he encouraged young men to break away from their families.</p> <p>\u201cI think the son has to cut free and maybe not have much to do with his parents for a year or two,\u201d he once explained.</p> <p>His thinking struck a chord.</p> <p>\u201cThere was something anarchic and anti-establishment about it,\u201d one man who has been a member since the late 80s told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cI\u2019d seen the rows my parents had, how they\u2019d tried to amass money and it hadn\u2019t helped them. I decided that the nuclear family didn\u2019t work for me. I didn\u2019t want the get-married-get-a job narrative. I was looking for something different and what it offered helped me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a03915ae2409db07995ffec5bbacfd1aad5432e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a03915ae2409db07995ffec5bbacfd1aad5432e0/0_0_5464_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sangharakshita teaching at the Hampstead Buddhist Temple in 1966.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sangharakshita, born Dennis Lingwood, teaching at the Hampstead Buddhist Temple in 1966.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Twine/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a growing number of predominantly young men flocked to Triratna, then called the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order (FWBO), it expanded dramatically. Today it has more than 30 centres in the UK alone and operates in 26 countries.</p> <p>Thousands mourned Lingwood when his funeral was broadcast at Triratna centres around the world. His obituary in the <em>Times</em> suggested that he had arguably done \u201cmore than any other person to popularise Buddhism in the west\u201d.</p> <p>But fissures within the community he founded are now becoming major fault lines. An internal report by nine disaffected members, who call themselves the Interkula, makes troubling reading about the order\u2019s historical safeguarding policies and the duty of care it had to its followers.</p> <p>Its <a href=\"http://www.interkula.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Interkula-survey-report-final.pdf\" title=\"\">incendiary findings have hitherto gone unpublicised</a>: a current member explained that it was not the Triratna way to share internal criticisms with the outside world. But they were drawn to the <em>Observer</em>\u2019s attention by a former member who claims he was manipulated into having sex with Lingwood.</p> <p>Of 423 respondents to a survey featured in the report, of whom two-thirds are order members and a quarter are \u201cMitras\u201d \u2013 followers who may aspire to become order members \u2013 55, around 13%, said that either they themselves, or someone they knew, had \u201cexperienced sexual misconduct by either Sangharakshita or other Triratna order members, in past and recent times\u201d.</p> <p>The report, which acknowledges that \u201csome good progress\u201d has been made in responding to the allegations, an approach the order describes as a \u201crestorative process\u201d, states: \u201cWhile many respondents described misconduct between a more experienced male OM [order member] and less experienced male Mitra, as has been described many times in the past, other types of misconduct were also reported, including male order members becoming sexually involved with very vulnerable women \u2026 and inappropriate behaviour by a female order member.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the comments in the report are damning. One order member of more than 15 years said: \u201cI know of several cases and the details are awful. They include alleged intervention on the part of one of the most high-profile OMs to try and encourage a victim not to testify to the police if questioned.\u201d</p> <p>Another said: \u201cYes, I know three OMs personally who experienced sexual misconduct by other OMs and have not been invited to participate in the restorative process.\u201d</p> <p>A third said: \u201cI was sexually abused by older order members.\u201d</p> <p>A fourth added: \u201cI know of four people who this describes. Only one of these was in the UK. I worry that this type of behaviour was much more widespread than generally believed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have friends who were sexually assaulted by senior OMs in recent times,\u201d another said. \u201cThey reported it to other senior OMs. Nothing happened.\u201d</p> <p>It was not just men who were targeted.</p> <p>\u201cI know of a couple of women \u2018friends of the movement\u2019 who were pursued by male order members \u2026 both very vulnerable women \u2013 one ex-prison[er] pursued and one severe mental health problems \u2013 entered into sexual relationship with.\u201d</p> <p>Some of those who completed the survey questioned Triratna\u2019s appetite for investigating the abuse.</p> <p>\u201cI think there is a large denial factor \u2026 I\u2019m up for selling assets and making amends as part of us moving on and acknowledging our ignorance of the abuse,\u201d one said.</p> <p>If it came to that, and several law firms have floated the idea of bringing claims against Triratna, it would certainly have assets to sell. The latest accounts of its charitable arm, the Triratna Preceptors\u2019 College Trust, reveal that in 2017, the most recent figures available, it alone was sitting on net assets worth more than \u00a33.3m. It bought Adhisthana several years ago for a rumoured \u00a35m.</p> <p>But this is only part of the picture. The accounts explain that the trust acts as a hub for dozens of charities that operate in the UK and overseas. One member told the <em>Observer</em> that, in Cambridge alone, Triratna had eight or nine properties worth between \u00a3700,000 and \u00a32m each. Another member suggested that its entire property empire was worth more than \u00a3100m.</p> <p>It helps that the order is a charity and enjoys tax perks. And the fact that its members are often happy to work in its bookshops or cafes for very little helps keep its cost base low.</p> <p>Today, much of the trust\u2019s income comes from donations and organising spiritual retreats and meditation courses. Its position at the vanguard of the fashionable mindfulness movement was cemented four years ago when several of its leading members helped a cross-party group of MPs produce their influential <em><a href=\"https://www.themindfulnessinitiative.org/mindfulness-all-party-parliamentary-group\" title=\"\">Mindful Nation UK</a></em> report, which extolled the benefits of the new psychological approach in treating mental health problems such as depression.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"66d64a6b5161b0faaf893cf3c61841539a6e12ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66d64a6b5161b0faaf893cf3c61841539a6e12ff/894_203_5122_3073/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Dunlop, now 69, was a victim at the Triratna Buddhist community.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Dunlop, now 69, was a victim at the Triratna Buddhist community.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rosa Furneaux/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mark Dunlop left the order in 1985 after many years working for it. A heterosexual man, he felt compelled to have sexual relations with Lingwood over a four-year period. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have any charisma,\u201d Dunlop said. \u201cHe was a slightly weird guy, in a way that worked in his favour because I thought: \u2018I\u2019m not being swayed by his charisma.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cOne theory about narcissists is that they have experienced some kind of trauma in their childhood so they don\u2019t have any confidence in themselves, and they create this whole world as a compensation and manipulate other people to build up their own ego.</p> <p>\u201cThat fits with how Lingwood behaved. He built up this fantasy of himself as a spiritual teacher, someone on a higher plane of understanding, but I always sensed he wasn\u2019t a happy bunny. There was a sense of dissatisfaction lying underneath. I felt sorry for him, in a way. That\u2019s one of the reasons I wanted to help him bring Buddhism to the west.\u201d</p> <p>It now seems that Lingwood\u2019s behaviour provided a template that was copied by others who exploited the order\u2019s hierarchy. Many who came to it seeking enlightenment aspired to become members. But this made them vulnerable to coercion by those in senior positions.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a general feeling around at the time that you were \u2018blocked\u2019 if you had an aversion to gay sex,\u201d one former member recalled in an online forum.</p> <p>One Triratna retreat, in Norfolk, where Lingwood was resident for much of the 80s, was described by the member as \u201cmore reminiscent of a San Francisco gay bath-house than a Buddhist retreat\u201d.</p> <p>A current member told the <em>Observer</em> that in the early 90s a 17-year-old boy with obvious mental health problems ended up in a sexual relationship with an order member in his 40s when residing at a centre in the south-east.</p> <p>Five years ago, an order member at another centre in London was caught exposing himself to a young child in a supermarket. After being found to have committed several similar offences, he was suspended indefinitely.</p> <p>Misconduct has also been reported at centres overseas. One woman who attended an FWBO centre in New Zealand in the 90s said: \u201cThere was one ordained member when I was there who seemed to treat the centre as his own personal Tinder app, hooking up with one woman after another, using his position as guru to great advantage.\u201d</p> <p>Concerns were first raised about the order in a BBC news report in the early 90s, and then again in 1997 when the <em>Guardian</em> revealed sexual misconduct at one of its centres, in Croydon, south London. That expos\u00e9 prompted the resignation of one member of the order.</p> <p>In response to the <em>Guardian</em>\u2019s report, one of the order\u2019s senior members, Kulananda, wrote to the paper stressing that the abuse was confined to one centre and one individual. But in a blog posting 20 years later, <a href=\"http://goingforrefuge.blogspot.com/2017/09/interesting.html\" title=\"\">Kulananda confirmed</a> hehad been in a sexual relationship with Lingwood and that he had come to see that the guru\u2019s behaviour towards others had engendered a \u201ccultish-ness at the heart of things that, I believe, will ultimately be our downfall\u201d.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ex-cult.org/fwbo/fwbofiles.htm\" title=\"\">FWBO Files website </a>contains a vast and growing repository of allegations from ex-members expressing similar views.</p> <p>Towards the end of his life, Lingwood appears to have acknowledged the damage he had unleashed, expressing \u201cdeep regret for all the occasions on which I have hurt, harmed or upset fellow Buddhists\u201d. But, even today, the order seems unwilling to confront its past head on: Triratna now describes Lingwood\u2019s behaviour as \u201cunskilful\u201d, a key Buddhist term, but one which, to outsiders, seems to underplay the consequences of his predatory actions.</p> <p>The order\u2019s safeguarding officer, who goes by the spiritual name Munisha, insisted the order had learned lessons from past mistakes and said every Triratna centre in the UK now has a safeguarding officer.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m extremely sorry if misconduct reported to any member of the order was not properly addressed at the time,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Interkula\u2019s survey includes accounts of misconduct which we would be keen to address. However, some of these are references to misconduct experienced by unnamed others, and we can only address a case where a named complainant is willing to tell us their story first hand.</p> <p>\u201cIt is the policy of Triratna\u2019s central safeguarding team that anything reported to us of a criminal \u2013 or even potentially criminal \u2013 nature is reported to the police, without exception.\u201d</p> <p>She confirmed that one of the order\u2019s most senior members, Suvajra, who some had seen as a potential successor to Sangharakshita, had been \u201csuspended in December 2018 after a rigorous internal disciplinary panel process found on a balance of probabilities that serious ethical misconduct had taken place.\u201d She declined to explain the nature of the alleged misconduct.</p> <p>Lingwood, of course, escaped such censure in his lifetime, enjoying the tranquillity of his final years cosseted away in the idyillic setting of Coddington Court, feted by his followers. Perhaps, though, in the twilight of his life, he anticipated that a higher judgment awaited him. His translation of a Buddhist text \u2013 Verses that Protect the Truth \u2013 was read out at his funeral.</p> <p>One verse must have given him pause for thought: \u201cLead a righteous life, not one that is corrupt.

      "bodyText": "Coddington Court, near the Herefordshire market town of Ledbury, is a late-18th-century red brick mansion surrounded by farmland. These days it goes by the name of Adhisthana, reflecting its reincarnation as the headquarters of one of the most influential Buddhist orders in the world, the Triratna Community, whose founder, Sangharakshita, lived there until his death last year at the age of 93. With its impressive grounds and gardens, it looks like a serene place for someone to spend their final years. But behind the scenes, the picture is a rather more turbulent one. For decades the order has been dogged by claims of sexual misconduct, claims that often strayed into allegations of coercion and abuse but which were thought to involve only a handful of individuals at worst. But now a bombshell internal report, produced by concerned members and shared with the Observer, has found that more than one in 10 of them claim to have experienced or observed sexual misconduct while in the order. Many of the allegations are against Sangharakshita himself, but others make it clear that he was not the only alleged perpetrator. Indeed, the report seems to indicate that the licentious culture the guru encouraged when he established his first centre in the 1960s, at a time when Timothy Leary was urging people to \u201cturn on, tune in, drop out\u201d, flourished across the order. Yet, despite the lurid revelations, Sangharakshita\u2019s influence lingers. The Adhisthana website carries many pictures of him, a bespectacled, slight man draped in holy robes. The photographs invite comparisons with Gandhi, but the two gurus come from very different backgrounds. Born Dennis Lingwood, the son of a French polisher from Tooting, Sangharakshita, meaning \u201cone who is protected by the spiritual community\u201d, deserted from the British army in India during the second world war and wandered the subcontinent, studying with several leading Tibetan lamas. Two decades on, he returned to London at the invitation of a group of Buddhists in Hampstead, with a mission to set up one of Britain\u2019s first monasteries, before leaving for reasons that are disputed. Some claim that he was caught using rent boys, an allegation that the Triratna community said it had not heard before. At the time of his departure, the Hampstead group issued a statement that said: \u201cWhatever may have been said to the detriment of his character in the course of recent speculation and gossip may now be withdrawn.\u201d Venturing out on his own, Lingwood developed his own, highly interpretative brand of Buddhism, drawing on elements of Nietzsche and Freud. Critics would accuse him of a pushing a \u201csemi-intellectual potpourri of Buddhism\u201d but he shrugged off the attacks, claiming he was helping the religion find new followers in the west. Many of his ideas were unorthodox. Lingwood encouraged heterosexual followers to experiment with homosexuality as a means of expanding their minds; he was deeply critical of the nuclear family and of mixed-sex communities in general; he encouraged young men to break away from their families. \u201cI think the son has to cut free and maybe not have much to do with his parents for a year or two,\u201d he once explained. His thinking struck a chord. \u201cThere was something anarchic and anti-establishment about it,\u201d one man who has been a member since the late 80s told the Observer. \u201cI\u2019d seen the rows my parents had, how they\u2019d tried to amass money and it hadn\u2019t helped them. I decided that the nuclear family didn\u2019t work for me. I didn\u2019t want the get-married-get-a job narrative. I was looking for something different and what it offered helped me.\u201d As a growing number of predominantly young men flocked to Triratna, then called the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order (FWBO), it expanded dramatically. Today it has more than 30 centres in the UK alone and operates in 26 countries. Thousands mourned Lingwood when his funeral was broadcast at Triratna centres around the world. His obituary in the Times suggested that he had arguably done \u201cmore than any other person to popularise Buddhism in the west\u201d. But fissures within the community he founded are now becoming major fault lines. An internal report by nine disaffected members, who call themselves the Interkula, makes troubling reading about the order\u2019s historical safeguarding policies and the duty of care it had to its followers. Its incendiary findings have hitherto gone unpublicised: a current member explained that it was not the Triratna way to share internal criticisms with the outside world. But they were drawn to the Observer\u2019s attention by a former member who claims he was manipulated into having sex with Lingwood. Of 423 respondents to a survey featured in the report, of whom two-thirds are order members and a quarter are \u201cMitras\u201d \u2013 followers who may aspire to become order members \u2013 55, around 13%, said that either they themselves, or someone they knew, had \u201cexperienced sexual misconduct by either Sangharakshita or other Triratna order members, in past and recent times\u201d. The report, which acknowledges that \u201csome good progress\u201d has been made in responding to the allegations, an approach the order describes as a \u201crestorative process\u201d, states: \u201cWhile many respondents described misconduct between a more experienced male OM [order member] and less experienced male Mitra, as has been described many times in the past, other types of misconduct were also reported, including male order members becoming sexually involved with very vulnerable women \u2026 and inappropriate behaviour by a female order member.\u201d Some of the comments in the report are damning. One order member of more than 15 years said: \u201cI know of several cases and the details are awful. They include alleged intervention on the part of one of the most high-profile OMs to try and encourage a victim not to testify to the police if questioned.\u201d Another said: \u201cYes, I know three OMs personally who experienced sexual misconduct by other OMs and have not been invited to participate in the restorative process.\u201d A third said: \u201cI was sexually abused by older order members.\u201d A fourth added: \u201cI know of four people who this describes. Only one of these was in the UK. I worry that this type of behaviour was much more widespread than generally believed.\u201d \u201cI have friends who were sexually assaulted by senior OMs in recent times,\u201d another said. \u201cThey reported it to other senior OMs. Nothing happened.\u201d It was not just men who were targeted. \u201cI know of a couple of women \u2018friends of the movement\u2019 who were pursued by male order members \u2026 both very vulnerable women \u2013 one ex-prison[er] pursued and one severe mental health problems \u2013 entered into sexual relationship with.\u201d Some of those who completed the survey questioned Triratna\u2019s appetite for investigating the abuse. \u201cI think there is a large denial factor \u2026 I\u2019m up for selling assets and making amends as part of us moving on and acknowledging our ignorance of the abuse,\u201d one said. If it came to that, and several law firms have floated the idea of bringing claims against Triratna, it would certainly have assets to sell. The latest accounts of its charitable arm, the Triratna Preceptors\u2019 College Trust, reveal that in 2017, the most recent figures available, it alone was sitting on net assets worth more than \u00a33.3m. It bought Adhisthana several years ago for a rumoured \u00a35m. But this is only part of the picture. The accounts explain that the trust acts as a hub for dozens of charities that operate in the UK and overseas. One member told the Observer that, in Cambridge alone, Triratna had eight or nine properties worth between \u00a3700,000 and \u00a32m each. Another member suggested that its entire property empire was worth more than \u00a3100m. It helps that the order is a charity and enjoys tax perks. And the fact that its members are often happy to work in its bookshops or cafes for very little helps keep its cost base low. Today, much of the trust\u2019s income comes from donations and organising spiritual retreats and meditation courses. Its position at the vanguard of the fashionable mindfulness movement was cemented four years ago when several of its leading members helped a cross-party group of MPs produce their influential Mindful Nation UK report, which extolled the benefits of the new psychological approach in treating mental health problems such as depression. Mark Dunlop left the order in 1985 after many years working for it. A heterosexual man, he felt compelled to have sexual relations with Lingwood over a four-year period. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have any charisma,\u201d Dunlop said. \u201cHe was a slightly weird guy, in a way that worked in his favour because I thought: \u2018I\u2019m not being swayed by his charisma.\u2019 \u201cOne theory about narcissists is that they have experienced some kind of trauma in their childhood so they don\u2019t have any confidence in themselves, and they create this whole world as a compensation and manipulate other people to build up their own ego. \u201cThat fits with how Lingwood behaved. He built up this fantasy of himself as a spiritual teacher, someone on a higher plane of understanding, but I always sensed he wasn\u2019t a happy bunny. There was a sense of dissatisfaction lying underneath. I felt sorry for him, in a way. That\u2019s one of the reasons I wanted to help him bring Buddhism to the west.\u201d It now seems that Lingwood\u2019s behaviour provided a template that was copied by others who exploited the order\u2019s hierarchy. Many who came to it seeking enlightenment aspired to become members. But this made them vulnerable to coercion by those in senior positions. \u201cThere was a general feeling around at the time that you were \u2018blocked\u2019 if you had an aversion to gay sex,\u201d one former member recalled in an online forum. One Triratna retreat, in Norfolk, where Lingwood was resident for much of the 80s, was described by the member as \u201cmore reminiscent of a San Francisco gay bath-house than a Buddhist retreat\u201d. A current member told the Observer that in the early 90s a 17-year-old boy with obvious mental health problems ended up in a sexual relationship with an order member in his 40s when residing at a centre in the south-east. Five years ago, an order member at another centre in London was caught exposing himself to a young child in a supermarket. After being found to have committed several similar offences, he was suspended indefinitely. Misconduct has also been reported at centres overseas. One woman who attended an FWBO centre in New Zealand in the 90s said: \u201cThere was one ordained member when I was there who seemed to treat the centre as his own personal Tinder app, hooking up with one woman after another, using his position as guru to great advantage.\u201d Concerns were first raised about the order in a BBC news report in the early 90s, and then again in 1997 when the Guardian revealed sexual misconduct at one of its centres, in Croydon, south London. That expos\u00e9 prompted the resignation of one member of the order. In response to the Guardian\u2019s report, one of the order\u2019s senior members, Kulananda, wrote to the paper stressing that the abuse was confined to one centre and one individual. But in a blog posting 20 years later, Kulananda confirmed hehad been in a sexual relationship with Lingwood and that he had come to see that the guru\u2019s behaviour towards others had engendered a \u201ccultish-ness at the heart of things that, I believe, will ultimately be our downfall\u201d. The FWBO Files website contains a vast and growing repository of allegations from ex-members expressing similar views. Towards the end of his life, Lingwood appears to have acknowledged the damage he had unleashed, expressing \u201cdeep regret for all the occasions on which I have hurt, harmed or upset fellow Buddhists\u201d. But, even today, the order seems unwilling to confront its past head on: Triratna now describes Lingwood\u2019s behaviour as \u201cunskilful\u201d, a key Buddhist term, but one which, to outsiders, seems to underplay the consequences of his predatory actions. The order\u2019s safeguarding officer, who goes by the spiritual name Munisha, insisted the order had learned lessons from past mistakes and said every Triratna centre in the UK now has a safeguarding officer. \u201cI\u2019m extremely sorry if misconduct reported to any member of the order was not properly addressed at the time,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Interkula\u2019s survey includes accounts of misconduct which we would be keen to address. However, some of these are references to misconduct experienced by unnamed others, and we can only address a case where a named complainant is willing to tell us their story first hand. \u201cIt is the policy of Triratna\u2019s central safeguarding team that anything reported to us of a criminal \u2013 or even potentially criminal \u2013 nature is reported to the police, without exception.\u201d She confirmed that one of the order\u2019s most senior members, Suvajra, who some had seen as a potential successor to Sangharakshita, had been \u201csuspended in December 2018 after a rigorous internal disciplinary panel process found on a balance of probabilities that serious ethical misconduct had taken place.\u201d She declined to explain the nature of the alleged misconduct. Lingwood, of course, escaped such censure in his lifetime, enjoying the tranquillity of his final years cosseted away in the idyillic setting of Coddington Court, feted by his followers. Perhaps, though, in the twilight of his life, he anticipated that a higher judgment awaited him. His translation of a Buddhist text \u2013 Verses that Protect the Truth \u2013 was read out at his funeral. One verse must have given him pause for thought: \u201cLead a righteous life, not one that is corrupt. The righteous live happily, both in this world and the next.\u201d \u2018Leaving mother\u2019: the group credo Key extracts from Leaving Mother and Initiation into Manhood, a document written by a senior member of the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order in the 1970s and shared down the years within the order. The document reflects and helped shape the order\u2019s thinking and confirms that much of Lingwood\u2019s more controversial teachings were embraced and promoted by others. \u201cAn initiation into manhood, then, is an experiential situation in which the false man dies in order that the true men may be born.

      "body": "<p>My son\u2019s attention span has settled in a bit, and for the first time he\u2019s showing an interest in regular television. His months-long obsession with <em>Baby Shark</em> is well-documented, but that dropped off once he started crawling. What wonder could fish song hold against the golden, imperious thrill of traipsing back and forth between the fireplace and the plant pot 18 times an hour on an eternal quest to place our home\u2019s many and various hazardous materials inside his waiting mouth? Whether dry earth, dusty soot or a Wotsit that\u2019s sat beneath our sofa since the Neolithic, he continues his ravenous travails on a loop for hours, like a chubby, cheerful little wind-up toy.</p> <p>But now, like people who are into fishing, or speaking Welsh, he has a steady diet of regular programming directed toward his interests. One favourite is <em>Paw Patrol</em>, a blaring, libertarian nightmare in which some gadget-mad puppies are conscripted into a privatised paramilitary unit of first responders. At the behest of a billionaire child king, they pilot rescue crafts for undisclosed fees to the terrified citizens of Adventure Bay. It\u2019s as if Elon Musk bought Port Talbot and took full control of its emergency services.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Unlike other kids' TV shows, Night Garden isn't on drugs, it is a drug</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>No such madness compares to the concussed mania of <em>In the Night Garden</em>, my son\u2019s favourite. From <em>Magic Roundabout</em> to the <em>Teletubbies</em>, hacks have lazily implied that children\u2019s TV is reminiscent of drug experiences. <em>Night Garden</em> is different, it\u2019s not on drugs, it is a drug, and one whose soporific qualities are uniquely mystifying.</p> <p>Ostensibly a dream in the mind of a child, it concerns Iggle Piggle, a monstrous blue entity with a head like a kidney bean whose lopsided mouth appears to have been kicked into his head with a steel-toed boot. He sails each evening to a daylit island garden, meeting a tongue-twisting cadre of acquaintances \u2013 Upsy Daisy, Makka Pakka, the Tombliboos, etc \u2013 all of whom are forced to enact their tedious microdramas for our amusement. Here, the tombliboos lose their trousers. There, Makka Pakka attaches a sponge to his bicycle. In narrative terms, you\u2019d experience greater dramatic tension by reading a series of WiFi passwords, but it holds my son perfectly enthralled.</p> <p>After about 20 minutes of these tepid misadventures, the final shot always shows Iggle Piggle sailing home, unconscious, in his boat. He is cast out from this Eden every night because his very form is an affront to God, but this exile can only be enforced once he is asleep, for even the Almighty cannot look such an abomination in the eye.</p> <p>By this point, of course, my son is very nearly asleep. Cuddling a plush toy Iggle Piggle, he stretches little limbs and dreams himself, of that garden in the night, or of the soft, edible soils of some other, more sensible land.</p> <p><em>Follow S\u00e9amas on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shockproofbeats?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@shockproofbeats</a></em></p>",

What wonder could fish song hold against the golden, imperious thrill of traipsing back and forth between the fireplace and the plant pot 18 times an hour on an eternal quest to place our home\u2019s many and various hazardous materials inside his waiting mouth? Whether dry earth, dusty soot or a Wotsit that\u2019s sat beneath our sofa since the Neolithic, he continues his ravenous travails on a loop for hours, like a chubby, cheerful little wind-up toy. But now, like people who are into fishing, or speaking Welsh, he has a steady diet of regular programming directed toward his interests. One favourite is Paw Patrol, a blaring, libertarian nightmare in which some gadget-mad puppies are conscripted into a privatised paramilitary unit of first responders. At the behest of a billionaire child king, they pilot rescue crafts for undisclosed fees to the terrified citizens of Adventure Bay. It\u2019s as if Elon Musk bought Port Talbot and took full control of its emergency services. No such madness compares to the concussed mania of In the Night Garden, my son\u2019s favourite. From Magic Roundabout to the Teletubbies, hacks have lazily implied that children\u2019s TV is reminiscent of drug experiences. Night Garden is different, it\u2019s not on drugs, it is a drug, and one whose soporific qualities are uniquely mystifying. Ostensibly a dream in the mind of a child, it concerns Iggle Piggle, a monstrous blue entity with a head like a kidney bean whose lopsided mouth appears to have been kicked into his head with a steel-toed boot. He sails each evening to a daylit island garden, meeting a tongue-twisting cadre of acquaintances \u2013 Upsy Daisy, Makka Pakka, the Tombliboos, etc \u2013 all of whom are forced to enact their tedious microdramas for our amusement. Here, the tombliboos lose their trousers. There, Makka Pakka attaches a sponge to his bicycle. In narrative terms, you\u2019d experience greater dramatic tension by reading a series of WiFi passwords, but it holds my son perfectly enthralled. After about 20 minutes of these tepid misadventures, the final shot always shows Iggle Piggle sailing home, unconscious, in his boat. He is cast out from this Eden every night because his very form is an affront to God, but this exile can only be enforced once he is asleep, for even the Almighty cannot look such an abomination in the eye. By this point, of course, my son is very nearly asleep. Cuddling a plush toy Iggle Piggle, he stretches little limbs and dreams himself, of that garden in the night, or of the soft, edible soils of some other, more sensible land.

The mayor\u2019s office has the last word on high-profile London developments, so despite the 305m (1,000ft) Tulip gaining planning permission in April, it has now been rejected on the grounds of its limited public amenity and unedifying design. For now, the City has been spared Foster + Partners\u2019 floral folie de grandeur, another dire, priapic extrusion of capital that threatened to have \u201cthe appearance of a surveillance tower\u201d on the London skyline.</p> <p>Views on the ugliness, or otherwise, of architecture are never hard to solicit. \u201cWhat an ugly building\u201d has become a familiar knee-jerk response, wearyingly emblematic of the apparent chasm between public and professional points of view. The U-word surfaced yet again with the recent publication of an interim report from the government\u2019s Building Better, Building Beautiful Commission, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/nov/25/would-you-trust-roger-scruton-to-design-your-new-home-commission-building-better-building-beautiful\" title=\"\">the national taste watchdog initially headed by Roger Scruton</a>, tasked with improving the design of housing and neighbourhoods. It urged local councils to have the confidence to \u201csay no to ugliness\u201d.</p> <p>Compared with vast acreages of publications on theories of beauty, ugliness has been given relatively short shrift as a subject of intellectual inquiry. To its limited canon can now be added <em>Ugliness and Judgment</em>, a new book by architectural historian Timothy Hyde, which strikes out beyond the shallow babble of style wars into deeper and more intriguing terrain, to examine the consequences of judgments of ugliness in architecture. Episodically structured as a series of discrete narratives that crystallise particular critical exchanges and moments in history, it begins in 18th-century Bath, where, as Hyde writes, \u201cthe role and purpose of the aesthetic register of architecture came decisively into view\u201d, with the concept of ugliness emerging as an instrument of political and social transformation. Charles\u2019s carbuncle even makes an early appearance in the Ugly Face Clubs of the era, whose members had to demonstrate qualifying physiognomy. A \u201clarge Carbuncle Potatoe Nose\u201d ensured acceptance.</p> <p>Over time, arguments and judgments about what constitutes ugliness in architecture \u2013 whether it be incompleteness, incongruity or incorrectness \u2013 have leached out beyond the profession. Staged in courtrooms, parliamentary committees and public inquiries, strident debates about ugly buildings have influenced the development of technology, the letter of the law, church teaching, the context of criticism, the role of the state and even monarchical privilege. Charles\u2019s now numerous extraconstitutional interventions form the basis of the concluding chapter, set against the more orthodox workings of the public inquiry in determining the fate of controversial civic projects, emphasising how contemporary claims about ugliness are, for better or worse, helping to refashion the state\u2019s participation in cultural production.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2057755e826cc4ab94d65f3c69d75f8c7588ce2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2057755e826cc4ab94d65f3c69d75f8c7588ce2/0_58_4000_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woolwich Central the south London complex that won the 2014 Carbuncle cup.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Woolwich Central the south London complex that won the 2014 Carbuncle cup.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Savage / Alamy/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Materiality of buildings is also a key theme. During the construction of the Houses of Parliament, the quest to find a type of stone that would not rot or stain \u2013 and thus become ugly \u2013 in London\u2019s increasingly polluted atmosphere prompted wider epiphanies about the industrial metropolis. Aesthetic and legislative strategies to combat its capacity for civic uglification included the development of terracotta, which, unlike stone, proved admirably resistant to the corrosive effects of the \u201cLondon particular\u201d, and the evolution of nuisance laws to address the newly recognised inseparability of individual buildings in a city shaped by its atmosphere.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/sep/12/why-i-love-living-in-the-woolwich-central-carbuncle\">Why I love living in the Woolwich Central \u2018carbuncle\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A deliciously gossipy chapter on ugliness and the development of libel law recounts the travails of John Soane, who repeatedly and fruitlessly sued critics of his buildings. The Modern Goth, a satirical poem published in the <em>Observer</em> in October 1796 concluded \u201cIn silence build from models of Your own / And never imitate the work of Sxxne\u201d. When its author was revealed to be surveyor Philip Norris, Soane took up legal cudgels, but claims of libel were dismissed by the jury after half an hour\u2019s deliberation. In Norris\u2019s defence, his lawyers argued that since the target of his poetic opprobrium, <a href=\"https://www.architecture.com/image-library/ribapix/image-information/poster/duplicate-of-riba3073-design-for-the-three-per-cent-consols-office-bank-of-england-threadneedle-stre/posterid/RIBA3931.html\" title=\"\">Soane\u2019s design for the Bank of England,</a> was \u201ca public work in which the national taste was to some degree involved, criticism ought to be entirely free upon it\u201d.</p> <p>As Hyde eloquently demonstrates in a compelling trajectory that arcs from Stonehenge to modern London, ugliness is more than a physical trait or quality assigned to an object. It has acted as a site and catalyst for debate on broader social circumstances of change and conflict, codifying, clarifying and improving in its wake. Beyond the casually slung insult, ugliness has a surprisingly rich inner life, and in shaping architecture\u2019s wider relationship with society, it has proved to be an exquisitely necessary evil.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Ugliness and Judgment: On Architecture in the Public Eye </em>by Timothy Hyde is published by Princeton Press, \u00a327.

Views on the ugliness, or otherwise, of architecture are never hard to solicit. \u201cWhat an ugly building\u201d has become a familiar knee-jerk response, wearyingly emblematic of the apparent chasm between public and professional points of view. The U-word surfaced yet again with the recent publication of an interim report from the government\u2019s Building Better, Building Beautiful Commission, the national taste watchdog initially headed by Roger Scruton, tasked with improving the design of housing and neighbourhoods. It urged local councils to have the confidence to \u201csay no to ugliness\u201d. Compared with vast acreages of publications on theories of beauty, ugliness has been given relatively short shrift as a subject of intellectual inquiry. To its limited canon can now be added Ugliness and Judgment, a new book by architectural historian Timothy Hyde, which strikes out beyond the shallow babble of style wars into deeper and more intriguing terrain, to examine the consequences of judgments of ugliness in architecture. Episodically structured as a series of discrete narratives that crystallise particular critical exchanges and moments in history, it begins in 18th-century Bath, where, as Hyde writes, \u201cthe role and purpose of the aesthetic register of architecture came decisively into view\u201d, with the concept of ugliness emerging as an instrument of political and social transformation. Charles\u2019s carbuncle even makes an early appearance in the Ugly Face Clubs of the era, whose members had to demonstrate qualifying physiognomy. A \u201clarge Carbuncle Potatoe Nose\u201d ensured acceptance. Over time, arguments and judgments about what constitutes ugliness in architecture \u2013 whether it be incompleteness, incongruity or incorrectness \u2013 have leached out beyond the profession. Staged in courtrooms, parliamentary committees and public inquiries, strident debates about ugly buildings have influenced the development of technology, the letter of the law, church teaching, the context of criticism, the role of the state and even monarchical privilege. Charles\u2019s now numerous extraconstitutional interventions form the basis of the concluding chapter, set against the more orthodox workings of the public inquiry in determining the fate of controversial civic projects, emphasising how contemporary claims about ugliness are, for better or worse, helping to refashion the state\u2019s participation in cultural production. Materiality of buildings is also a key theme. During the construction of the Houses of Parliament, the quest to find a type of stone that would not rot or stain \u2013 and thus become ugly \u2013 in London\u2019s increasingly polluted atmosphere prompted wider epiphanies about the industrial metropolis. Aesthetic and legislative strategies to combat its capacity for civic uglification included the development of terracotta, which, unlike stone, proved admirably resistant to the corrosive effects of the \u201cLondon particular\u201d, and the evolution of nuisance laws to address the newly recognised inseparability of individual buildings in a city shaped by its atmosphere. A deliciously gossipy chapter on ugliness and the development of libel law recounts the travails of John Soane, who repeatedly and fruitlessly sued critics of his buildings. The Modern Goth, a satirical poem published in the Observer in October 1796 concluded \u201cIn silence build from models of Your own / And never imitate the work of Sxxne\u201d. When its author was revealed to be surveyor Philip Norris, Soane took up legal cudgels, but claims of libel were dismissed by the jury after half an hour\u2019s deliberation. In Norris\u2019s defence, his lawyers argued that since the target of his poetic opprobrium, Soane\u2019s design for the Bank of England, was \u201ca public work in which the national taste was to some degree involved, criticism ought to be entirely free upon it\u201d. As Hyde eloquently demonstrates in a compelling trajectory that arcs from Stonehenge to modern London, ugliness is more than a physical trait or quality assigned to an object. It has acted as a site and catalyst for debate on broader social circumstances of change and conflict, codifying, clarifying and improving in its wake. Beyond the casually slung insult, ugliness has a surprisingly rich inner life, and in shaping architecture\u2019s wider relationship with society, it has proved to be an exquisitely necessary evil. \u2022 Ugliness and Judgment: On Architecture in the Public Eye by Timothy Hyde is published by Princeton Press, \u00a327.

Yet despite the formal setting (an opera house transformed into a cinema and filled with rapt film students), Varda\u2019s tone remains generously intimate, friendly and unpretentious. At 90 and dressed in her signature head-to-toe purple, she is lucid and funny, able to parse her \u201cfailures\u201d (such as 1995\u2019s Robert De Niro-starring One Hundred and One Nights) as well as her successes. Running just shy of two hours, it\u2019s a little long but, in Varda\u2019s defence, there\u2019s a lot of material to get through. Excited by \u201cdreams and reveries\u201d, cats and potatoes, beaches, mirrors, social justice movements (she made films about the Black Panthers and \u201cthe feminist fight\u201d) and, of course, her beloved late husband, Jacques Demy, Varda\u2019s range is truly inspiring. Also inspiring is the playful, resourceful way she navigated the technological changes that came with the 21st century. Varda talks about the three governing principles of film-making as \u201cinspiration\u201d, \u201ccreation\u201d and \u201csharing\u201d. Describing the editing process of 1962\u2019s Cl\u00e9o from 5 to 7, she explains how she played with depicting the passing of time, because it \u201cfeels different depending on whether we\u2019re waiting for something or having fun\u201d. What\u2019s so invigorating is the way she gives each principle equal weighting, discussing her formal decisions, such as Cl\u00e9o\u2019s editing or the tracking shots that move right to left in 1985\u2019s Vagabond, with the same intensity and enthusiasm as her more existential motivations (she describes her 1965 summer bummer classic Le Bonheur as \u201ca beautiful summer peach with a worm inside\u201d).",

Since her death aged 49 in 1988, the German musician, model and muse has become a footnote in the mid-20th-century avant garde, more famous for her liaisons than for her art. Straddling the worlds of music, art and film, she was a bit player in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/velvetunderground\" title=\"\">Velvet Underground</a>. Lou Reed, Jim Morrison and Bob Dylan were among her lovers, while the French film star Alain Delon was the father of her son.</p> <p>But she was also an artist in her own right, a musical expressionist whose eerie, druggy aesthetic has cast a ghostly influence over later generations of musicians. Sarah Frankcom and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/apr/21/maxine-peake-interview-avalanche-play-ivf-barbican\" title=\"\">Maxine Peake</a>, quite rightly, avoid the objectification of a simple biographical approach. Instead, they channel her through her 1968 album<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/oct/14/difficult-albums-nico\" title=\"\"><em>The Marble Index</em></a>, taking their cue from its most chilling line: \u201cIt\u2019s holding me against my will.\u201d</p> <p>The houselights stay up in the Stoller Hall as, dressed in a slouchy black coat, Peake wanders on to a stage laid out for an orchestra and gripy with audio feedback. At first she is hesitant, speaking partly on, and partly off, mic. Then on file 15 young female musicians, whose shiny faces and identical Hitler Youth uniforms offer the one piece of biographical mooring, to Nico\u2019s early childhood in Nazi Germany, where she was born in 1938.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/05/nico-in-manchester-she-loved-the-architecture-and-the-heroin\">Nico in Manchester: 'She loved the architecture \u2013\u00a0and the heroin'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This, it becomes clear, is a show all about possession. Peake is possessed by her subject, her voice swooping in and out of a creepy replica of Nico\u2019s deep, German-accented contralto. Nico is in thrall to any number of demons \u2013 most prosaically to heroin, but also to her own myth, and the dark side of sanity. Importantly, and most compellingly, both actor and subject are possessed by their creative mission.</p> <p>In doing so, the show makes a powerful point: it is not the world of men around whose periphery Nico flits, but the orchestra of her own life. While always playing wonderfully and inventively (at one point, a violinist bows with a hair comb), the ensemble becomes increasingly frantic and disorganised, until the players unbraid their hair and abandon their instruments to join Nico on the edge of the abyss. You don\u2019t need to know anything about her to be gripped by this metaphor for damaged creativity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"11e2212186749e2197cad9321a3377e394d6c61c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11e2212186749e2197cad9321a3377e394d6c61c/0_416_4215_2528/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Halina Reijn and Ramsey Nasr in Ivo van Hove\u2019s \u2018monumental\u2019 adaptation of The Fountainhead\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Halina Reijn and Ramsey Nasr in Ivo van Hove\u2019s \u2018monumental\u2019 adaptation of The Fountainhead.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A fascination with the tortured artist also animates Internationaal Theater Amsterdam\u2019s dramatisation of <a href=\"https://mif.co.uk/whats-on/the-fountainhead/\" title=\"\"><strong>The Fountainhead</strong></a>, the 1943 novel by Ayn Rand, which has lately become a calling card for rightwing politicians. Rand poured her theories of heroic individualism into her portrait of the young architect Howard Roark, whose self-belief is so self-annihilatingly absolute that he\u2019s prepared to torch his own social housing project rather than allow it to be modified (dismayingly, Donald Trump and the British home secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/31/nationalisation-state-save-steel-port-talbot-tata-industrial-policy\" title=\"\">Sajid Javid</a>, are among those to have claimed him as a hero).</p> <p>Ivo van Hove\u2019s monumental adaptation runs to over four hours on a vast white stage of the Lowry Centre. Reel-to-reel tape recorders whirr in the background, and an architectural drawing board commands the foreground, on to which Ramsey Nasr\u2019s flint-eyed Roark sketches buildings that loom into life on a screen in real time. Around him play chamber dramas of societal burn-out \u2013 a perfidious, alcoholic second-rater whose ambition is fanned by his elderly mother; a critic puffed up by his ability to make or break reputations; a cynical newspaper tycoon.</p> <p>At the black heart of Rand\u2019s vision is Roark\u2019s sadomasochistic relationship with a beautiful young idealist (Halina Reijn), who is so turned on by his rape of her that she sublimates herself in ever greater acts of sexual and social abasement in order to feel, and feed, his fire. It\u2019s all very stylish and watchable, but also massively overinvested in the narcissistic myth of the great (male) artist.

      "bodyText": "How can The Nico Project excavate a woman who has been stuck in the mythical permafrost for as long as Nico \u2013 and why would it want to? Since her death aged 49 in 1988, the German musician, model and muse has become a footnote in the mid-20th-century avant garde, more famous for her liaisons than for her art. Straddling the worlds of music, art and film, she was a bit player in the Velvet Underground. Lou Reed, Jim Morrison and Bob Dylan were among her lovers, while the French film star Alain Delon was the father of her son. But she was also an artist in her own right, a musical expressionist whose eerie, druggy aesthetic has cast a ghostly influence over later generations of musicians. Sarah Frankcom and Maxine Peake, quite rightly, avoid the objectification of a simple biographical approach. Instead, they channel her through her 1968 album The Marble Index, taking their cue from its most chilling line: \u201cIt\u2019s holding me against my will.\u201d The houselights stay up in the Stoller Hall as, dressed in a slouchy black coat, Peake wanders on to a stage laid out for an orchestra and gripy with audio feedback. At first she is hesitant, speaking partly on, and partly off, mic. Then on file 15 young female musicians, whose shiny faces and identical Hitler Youth uniforms offer the one piece of biographical mooring, to Nico\u2019s early childhood in Nazi Germany, where she was born in 1938. This, it becomes clear, is a show all about possession. Peake is possessed by her subject, her voice swooping in and out of a creepy replica of Nico\u2019s deep, German-accented contralto. Nico is in thrall to any number of demons \u2013 most prosaically to heroin, but also to her own myth, and the dark side of sanity. Importantly, and most compellingly, both actor and subject are possessed by their creative mission. In doing so, the show makes a powerful point: it is not the world of men around whose periphery Nico flits, but the orchestra of her own life. While always playing wonderfully and inventively (at one point, a violinist bows with a hair comb), the ensemble becomes increasingly frantic and disorganised, until the players unbraid their hair and abandon their instruments to join Nico on the edge of the abyss. You don\u2019t need to know anything about her to be gripped by this metaphor for damaged creativity. A fascination with the tortured artist also animates Internationaal Theater Amsterdam\u2019s dramatisation of The Fountainhead, the 1943 novel by Ayn Rand, which has lately become a calling card for rightwing politicians. Rand poured her theories of heroic individualism into her portrait of the young architect Howard Roark, whose self-belief is so self-annihilatingly absolute that he\u2019s prepared to torch his own social housing project rather than allow it to be modified (dismayingly, Donald Trump and the British home secretary, Sajid Javid, are among those to have claimed him as a hero). Ivo van Hove\u2019s monumental adaptation runs to over four hours on a vast white stage of the Lowry Centre. Reel-to-reel tape recorders whirr in the background, and an architectural drawing board commands the foreground, on to which Ramsey Nasr\u2019s flint-eyed Roark sketches buildings that loom into life on a screen in real time. Around him play chamber dramas of societal burn-out \u2013 a perfidious, alcoholic second-rater whose ambition is fanned by his elderly mother; a critic puffed up by his ability to make or break reputations; a cynical newspaper tycoon. At the black heart of Rand\u2019s vision is Roark\u2019s sadomasochistic relationship with a beautiful young idealist (Halina Reijn), who is so turned on by his rape of her that she sublimates herself in ever greater acts of sexual and social abasement in order to feel, and feed, his fire. It\u2019s all very stylish and watchable, but also massively overinvested in the narcissistic myth of the great (male) artist. In allowing the devil all the best tunes, Van Hove seems to have forgotten he\u2019s the devil. Star ratings (out of five) The Nico Project \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 The Fountainhead \u2605\u2605\u2605 \u2022 The Nico Project is at the Stoller Hall, Manchester, until 21 July",

Her own. \u201cAnd I had to forgive myself for wasting so many years, instead of punishing myself for this\u2026 misshapen life.\u201d You don\u2019t so much interview Lyonne, I quickly learn, as herd her conversations like existential sheep. It is a precise chaos \u2013 she has a lot to say and is aware of the many limits of time. Her voice crackles across the busy restaurant \u2013 she moves like Joe Pesci as a <em>Simpsons</em> character. A waiter interrupts with a second plate of glistening meats: \u201cMadam, more hearts?\u201d \u201cIn many ways, I did think I was going to die.\u201d He makes briefly frantic eye contact with me, then disappears. \u201cSo now I\u2019ve had to think, what is the most honest way that I can live?

And some years later, having slowly worked her way back into the public eye (with the help of her best friend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/chloe-sevigny\" title=\"\">Chlo\u00eb Sevigny</a>, who vouched for her sobriety) she rose again.</p> <p>Now 40, when she talks about a misshapen life, she\u2019s talking about one that can be cleanly dissected, tangerine-like, into three. The first segment, child star, is often prefaced by the word \u201ctragic\u201d; she\u2019s been estranged from her parents since she was a teenager. At 16 she was accepted at NYU to study film and philosophy, having decided to quit acting and become a director, but she left within days: $60k was too much, she realised, to spend rewatching <em>Apocalypse Now</em>. The second segment, the heroin years, were bookmarked by tabloid humiliation and such stories as: \u201cA judge in New York has issued an arrest warrant for the actress Natasha Lyonne, 26, who starred in the 1999 comedy <em>American Pie</em>. She failed to appear for a hearing on charges stemming from an alleged rampage last December during which she was heard threatening to molest a neighbour\u2019s dog.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until 2013 that she returned for this, her third act, starring as recovering drug addict and inmate Nicky Nichols on Netflix\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/orange-is-the-new-black\" title=\"\">Orange </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/orange-is-the-new-black\" title=\"\">is the New Black</a></em>, one of its first original shows and one that pushed for a diversity of representation using the Trojan horse of Taylor Schilling\u2019s Piper (a wealthy white protagonist) to smuggle out the intimate stories of women rarely heard. Lyonne\u2019s character had open-heart surgery after an overdose; the scar she showed was the actor\u2019s own. The effect of performing the life of an addict, revealing its humility and nuance as well as its scars, was that Lyonne herself was able to stop talking about that part of her life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ae7d47791a28b555704f1e17983f3d96f981a7e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ae7d47791a28b555704f1e17983f3d96f981a7e/0_253_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"7ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK season 7\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The effect of performing the life of an addict was that Lyonne herself was able to stop talking about that part of her life\u2019: starring in the latest season of Orange is the New Black.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: JoJo Whilden/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Except, then she made the mistake of writing, directing, and starring in the hit Netflix comedy series <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/mar/16/stuck-on-repeat-what-is-netflixs-russian-doll-actually-about\" title=\"\">Russian Doll</a></em>, which has just received 13 Emmy Award nominations, including one for outstanding comedy series and one for Lyonne as lead actress in a comedy.

She\u2019s talking. \u201cThis idea that perfection is totally attainable makes everybody feel like a failure on a daily basis, gender norms, the idea that money is an achievement, the idea that essentially anything superficial could make me feel OK, is such a dark system, one that is clearly not working. And people are suffering: there\u2019s a lot of violence around it, whether that\u2019s acted out violence or the sound of colliding thoughts asking, \u2018What does it all mean,\u2019 and\u2026\u201d The waiter clears his throat. \u201cMore chicken hearts.\u201d There are, yes, three servings of chicken hearts now, presented on skewers made of rosemary, and Lyonne deftly swipes them all on to her plate while completing her thoughts on the violence of modern life. It\u2019s 6pm.</p> <p>And I am getting a sense of the pace of Lyonne\u2019s mind, a thing she has hungrily fed with such meats as Ingmar Bergman and Dadaism since she was expelled from her Orthodox Jewish high school for selling weed, and which she continues to feed, with politics, philosophy and <em>New York Times</em> crosswords. \u201cYou know when Paul Newman talks to Big Daddy in <em>Hot Tin Roof</em> about the click?

Click.</p> <p>In April, she constructed a crossword for the <em>New York Times</em> herself. \u201cI have become someone who thinks in clues, who jokes in puzzles and who lives for the answers,\u201d she wrote. Clues included: \u201cPoehler vortex of funniness?\u201d The answer being \u201cAmy\u201d, co-creator of <em>Russian Doll</em> (the series came about after Poehler called her and said: \u201cYou know, as long as I\u2019ve known you, you\u2019ve always been the oldest girl in the world.\u201d) Another was \u201cPortlandia airer\u201d, about her partner Fred Armisen\u2019s sketch series, and one of the last was, \u201cWhere one might kick a habit, informally\u201d: Rehab.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"21db33344f90ba323cc042b08f850bbe31e69444\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21db33344f90ba323cc042b08f850bbe31e69444/0_0_3248_1949/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Early break: in 1999\u2019s American Pie with Tara Reid.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Early break: in 1999\u2019s American Pie with Tara Reid.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For her 40th birthday that same month, she wanted to celebrate in a way that would give her guests the \u201csensation their brain was melting,\u201d but that is a tricky ask, sober. Her solution was to rent two cinemas, one in New York, where she screened <em>The King of Comedy</em>, and one in LA, where she screened Lina Wertm\u00fcller\u2019s <em>Seven Beauties</em>. Did her friends appreciate it? She shrugs. \u201cIt was good for them!\u201d she shouts.</p> <p>As she\u2019s got older, rather than simply moving forward, she gives a sense of having circled back around the tangerine, to reassess unusual moments of childhood. In <em>Russian Doll</em>, Lyonne\u2019s character Nadia dies, and dies, and dies again, reappearing in front of the same mirror each time, to try and unlock the puzzle box of mortality. When she sat down to watch the whole series, Lyonne was struck by, \u201cHow much the show was unintentionally about suicide. About not \u2018taking yourself out\u2019. And I think that there are so many ways in which we can take ourselves out of our lives, you know, even just by stopping participating. I found myself crying at the heaviness of it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/08/anthony-bourdain-chef-found-dead-61\" title=\"\">Anthony Bourdain</a> had just killed himself and I felt overwhelmed that the show was really speaking to the search for a meaningful life. But, simultaneously, acknowledging we all feel sort of strange and dirty, and perplexed by what we\u2019re doing here. And you know, that here were these characters willing each other to\u2026 stick around.\u201d</p> <p>In Lyonne\u2019s life, clues from her past flash now in neon. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting is that there was this person I abandoned for almost two decades, who knew exactly who I would emerge to be.\u201d She realised recently that she has been trying to write <em>Russian Doll</em> since she was a child. \u201cAt 16, I already knew who I was. But then had just the most insane waylaid life where at every turn, I was my own worst enemy. Then I reappeared, to tell that story.\u201d She chuckles. \u201cI\u2019m a letter of hope for weirdos who are having a hard time in high school, right? The very same things I was attacked for back then are the very same things that are now being rewarded.\u201d</p> <p>At 16, enrolling at NYU, \u201cI was like, \u2018I\u2019m going to make a comedy about, you know, [Jean-Paul Sartre\u2019s] <em>No Exit</em> and Viktor Frankl\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/09/viktor-frankls-book-on-the-psychology-of-the-holocaust-to-be-made-into-a-film\" title=\"\">Man\u2019s Search for Meaning</a></em>. A comedy about drama and the legacy of trauma.\u2019 I was like: \u2018This is going to be a funny half hour.\u2019 <em>Russian Doll</em> is coming from that natural, internal world. And no one is more surprised than me that things turned out so well. And, of course, I really have the perspective now to know that really, these are the good years. This is kind of as good as it gets.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"46f5b5b25b1d32e6d428bef41a50fc9e819b29cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46f5b5b25b1d32e6d428bef41a50fc9e819b29cb/0_1537_4388_5045/870.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I like to be late for gym, and I wear loafers and sunglasses\u2019: Natasha Lyonne wears dress by Christian Siriano, crown by H Crowne and bracelets by Maxlor.\" width=\"870\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I like to be late for gym, and I wear loafers and sunglasses\u2019: Natasha Lyonne wears dress by Christian Siriano, crown by H Crowne and bracelets by Maxlor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ramona Rosales/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A large part of this long-time-coming success, she says, is down to <em>Orange </em><em>is the New Black</em>. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very healing environment for me for seven years.\u201d The cast and crew had \u201cbeen through too many international time zones on too little sleep to lie to each other. I could just say, \u2018I think I\u2019m miserable\u2019, and there would be something in saying that that would defuse it. The magic of the truth and of a safe environment. Instead of constantly trying to lead a life of a cover-ups.\u201d</p> <p>It showed her safety and it showed her a different way to work and, then, live. \u201cA less performance-based life, where I could be moving through with a little bit more authenticity. Instead of leading a life where I was constantly convinced I was broken, and that I had to hide that from you. I was starting to be like: \u201cOh, wait a minute, everybody\u2019s fucked up and broken. They just had better parenting, so better tools for hiding it.\u2019\u201d She pauses.</p> <p>\u201cBut I was also slowly discovering that, increasingly, I was an authority in the room. That a lot of people would be looking to me as somebody who had more information, more years on set, more experience. I was like: \u2018I\u2019m kind of becoming an elder.\u2019\u201d She liked it. She liked it when she was invited to direct an episode in the final series, too. This is a show whose themes have run uncomfortably close to the headlines, from the death of a black inmate to this season\u2019s focus on immigration detention centres, subjects Lyonne wants to humanise.</p> <p>\u201cBeing trusted with an episode was very\u2026 life affirming. I\u2019d never graduated high school, I\u2019d never graduated college, I\u2019d never graduated a family, or relationship. My family was left in tatters. So there wasn\u2019t really a sense of closure, even when my parents died. There\u2019s no scenes in any of the deaths in my family that are like, by a hospital bed, with people saying sorry. It was more sudden, with traumatic phone calls. So I never really had that experience of saying goodbye to anything in a healthy way, until now. I guess I\u2019d never, in many ways, really understood the concept of unconditional love until <em>Orange</em>.\u201d She nods with the realisation, \u201cHuh.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa773aba86c24f5722b6b77647adef11c059760a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa773aba86c24f5722b6b77647adef11c059760a/0_533_4054_2433/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I\u2019m a letter of hope for weirdos who are having a hard time in high school\u2019: with best friend Chlo\u00eb Sevigny.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019m a letter of hope for weirdos who are having a hard time in high school\u2019: with best friend Chlo\u00eb Sevigny.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maarten de Boer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Watching <em>Orange </em><em>is the New Black</em> I had the growing realisation that women shouldn\u2019t go to prison. In the UK, 85% are there for non-violent offences, yet it takes barely weeks inside for them to lose their kids. Almost half committed their offence in order to support the drug use of someone else, and most are addicts themselves. Prison does not work. \u201cI agree,\u201d she says. \u201cCompletely. I mean, in many ways, I\u2019m very grateful I had such a public addiction story, you know? Sure, I find it tedious that 13 years later, people still want to talk about it as if it\u2019s \u2018juicy\u2019. To me, what is more interesting about it is that I never feel like anybody in that position is a stranger to me.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I first started on <em>Orange</em> I\u2019d never served time, but I\u2019d definitely been arrested enough times. And, you know, the idea I was somebody in the system, who is now \u2018the star\u2019 of Netflix shows, is pretty insane, and makes you think about how we should be treating individual cases, rather than just punishing everybody. Especially in that space between release and acclimating to society, this murky terrain, without hope. How to get people back into society, how to get back to life.\u201d</p> <p>In the final season we see Piper, our original antiheroine, released from Litchfield to find herself free, but in new kinds of chains. \u201cBut you know, I agree with you. I find it devastating that prisoners are victims of sexual abuse or physical violence, or drug addicts. Look, the reason anybody\u2019s addicted to drugs or, you know, <em>their cell phones</em> in the first place is because they\u2019re constantly trying to process trauma, and find a moment\u2019s relief.\u201d</p> <p>Lyonne squeezes half a lemon into a glass of ice as if she\u2019s wringing its neck. \u201cThey\u2019re not doing it because they\u2019re stupid, or bad people. To then punish them for having an internal experience that is inherently punishing, is so malicious. So without grace. So brutal.\u201d Again a waiter comes, and again, he goes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df18a878dadafe22a7256d152e84bc22831e8503\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df18a878dadafe22a7256d152e84bc22831e8503/0_1431_4388_4574/959.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I\u2018ve become someone who thinks in clues, who jokes in puzzles\u2019: Natasha Lyonne wears dress by Erdem, boots by Tamara Mellon and headpiece by Rinaldy A Yunardi.\" width=\"959\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2018ve become someone who thinks in clues, who jokes in puzzles\u2019: Natasha Lyonne wears dress by Erdem, boots by Tamara Mellon and headpiece by Rinaldy A Yunardi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ramona Rosales/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Every morning, Lyonne goes to the gym. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m sporty, I\u2019m very sporty, you don\u2019t believe me? When I was a kid I went to an Israeli army training programme where I would shoot an M16.\u201d But, just as at school where she\u2019d adhere to the dress code, but wear it skin-tight and with spike heels, she rebels. \u201cI always try to be late. And I don\u2019t wear gym clothes. I\u2019m wearing, like, Gucci loafers, sunglasses, chains. And I\u2019m late. I don\u2019t like the whole intro chapter in any class. There\u2019s a lot of small talk. I hate small talk.\u201d</p> <p>And today, she works harder than ever, but on her own terms. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why people always want to shoot at five in the morning? They\u2019re obsessed with daylight. But you know who\u2019s not obsessed with daylight? Dracula. Right. And he\u2019s been alive a long time. So who\u2019s winning that war, hmm?\u201d</p> <p>Part of her career upsurge, she believes, is due to the world getting worse: there is a need for entertainment that does more than make us laugh. \u201cYou have this movement that\u2019s in revolt, saying, \u2018We want to hear people\u2019s stories, we want to go right to the source for the truth. And otherwise, we\u2019re going to call it out as a lie.\u2019\u201d She tells me about a book she\u2019s reading by a Swedish professor that proves humankind is doing better than ever before, but even as she says it, the turn of her mouth suggests she finds it hard to believe.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of very bad news out there. Like there\u2019s a lot of evidence to support that things are very, very bleak. And, in fact, mounting in that direction.\u201d She looks at her phone, then, groaning, turns it over. \u201cBut even as we\u2019re aware of horrors mounting, we\u2019re also constantly distracted. The same device that\u2019s giving us all this insider information, in real time, is also, you know, constantly showing us cat videos.\u201d Which is what she tweets, a lot, along with dancing penguins and, the day after we meet, a link to a montage titled: \u201cHow Debbie Harry Learned to Deal With Superficial, Demeaning Interviewers.\u201d</p> <p>Soon after forming her new production company with old friend Maya Rudolph she sent her a YouTube link to a time-lapse video of the end of the world. \u201cIt fucked me up,\u201d Rudolph said, mildly. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Lyonne sighs today, \u201cI do think that these are legitimately scary times. But, I\u2019m wired for hope. In many ways, the reason I\u2019m not dead is because there\u2019s a fighter in me that wants to survive. And see, well, maybe not a happy ending, but at least a meaningful one.\u201d The last heart, gone.</p> <p><em>The seventh and final season of Orange </em><em>is the New Black is on Netflix from 26 July</em></p> <p><em>Fashion credits: Natasha Lyonne was shot at Edge Studios NY; digital by Michael Guide; assisted by Danny Calderon and Simon McDermott-Johnson; styling by Kevin Ericson for Cristina Ehrlich; hair by Marcus Francis at Starworks Artists; makeup by Molly Greenwald using Armani Beauty at Starworks Artists</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "In a busy Manhattan restaurant, Natasha Lyonne is eating chicken hearts and talking about resurrection. Her own. \u201cAnd I had to forgive myself for wasting so many years, instead of punishing myself for this\u2026 misshapen life.\u201d You don\u2019t so much interview Lyonne, I quickly learn, as herd her conversations like existential sheep. It is a precise chaos \u2013 she has a lot to say and is aware of the many limits of time. Her voice crackles across the busy restaurant \u2013 she moves like Joe Pesci as a Simpsons character. A waiter interrupts with a second plate of glistening meats: \u201cMadam, more hearts?\u201d \u201cIn many ways, I did think I was going to die.\u201d He makes briefly frantic eye contact with me, then disappears. \u201cSo now I\u2019ve had to think, what is the most honest way that I can live? That feels the least like a lie? That means I\u2019m less likely to self-destruct all over again?\u201d Lyonne has been acting since she was six, first in adverts \u201cfor dolls that don\u2019t exist any more\u201d, then with directors including Woody Allen, and in hits such as American Pie, before being hospitalised in 2005 with hepatitis C, a heart infection and a collapsed lung, and undergoing methadone treatment under the smirking glare of New York\u2019s paparazzi. And some years later, having slowly worked her way back into the public eye (with the help of her best friend Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, who vouched for her sobriety) she rose again. Now 40, when she talks about a misshapen life, she\u2019s talking about one that can be cleanly dissected, tangerine-like, into three. The first segment, child star, is often prefaced by the word \u201ctragic\u201d; she\u2019s been estranged from her parents since she was a teenager. At 16 she was accepted at NYU to study film and philosophy, having decided to quit acting and become a director, but she left within days: $60k was too much, she realised, to spend rewatching Apocalypse Now. The second segment, the heroin years, were bookmarked by tabloid humiliation and such stories as: \u201cA judge in New York has issued an arrest warrant for the actress Natasha Lyonne, 26, who starred in the 1999 comedy American Pie. She failed to appear for a hearing on charges stemming from an alleged rampage last December during which she was heard threatening to molest a neighbour\u2019s dog.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until 2013 that she returned for this, her third act, starring as recovering drug addict and inmate Nicky Nichols on Netflix\u2019s Orange is the New Black, one of its first original shows and one that pushed for a diversity of representation using the Trojan horse of Taylor Schilling\u2019s Piper (a wealthy white protagonist) to smuggle out the intimate stories of women rarely heard. Lyonne\u2019s character had open-heart surgery after an overdose; the scar she showed was the actor\u2019s own. The effect of performing the life of an addict, revealing its humility and nuance as well as its scars, was that Lyonne herself was able to stop talking about that part of her life. Except, then she made the mistake of writing, directing, and starring in the hit Netflix comedy series Russian Doll, which has just received 13 Emmy Award nominations, including one for outstanding comedy series and one for Lyonne as lead actress in a comedy. The series is a surreal and delicious investigation into the nature of life and death, which meant the cellar door creaked open and once again she was being asked about ghosts. She\u2019d slid into the seat in front of me on a humid Manhattan afternoon wearing a blazer and black, and a weight of gold chains, and started talking. \u201cLife and society are architected on a lot of ideas I just inherently don\u2019t believe in. I think that we are hooked on a lot of bullshit.\u201d The waiter appears again, a besuited vibration to the left of Lyonne\u2019s hair, but she ignores him. She\u2019s talking. \u201cThis idea that perfection is totally attainable makes everybody feel like a failure on a daily basis, gender norms, the idea that money is an achievement, the idea that essentially anything superficial could make me feel OK, is such a dark system, one that is clearly not working. And people are suffering: there\u2019s a lot of violence around it, whether that\u2019s acted out violence or the sound of colliding thoughts asking, \u2018What does it all mean,\u2019 and\u2026\u201d The waiter clears his throat. \u201cMore chicken hearts.\u201d There are, yes, three servings of chicken hearts now, presented on skewers made of rosemary, and Lyonne deftly swipes them all on to her plate while completing her thoughts on the violence of modern life. It\u2019s 6pm. And I am getting a sense of the pace of Lyonne\u2019s mind, a thing she has hungrily fed with such meats as Ingmar Bergman and Dadaism since she was expelled from her Orthodox Jewish high school for selling weed, and which she continues to feed, with politics, philosophy and New York Times crosswords. \u201cYou know when Paul Newman talks to Big Daddy in Hot Tin Roof about the click? And Big Daddy\u2019s screaming about mendacity and he\u2019s talking about alcohol? For me, there\u2019s a certain state when no one\u2019s awake. And I\u2019ll crack the puzzle. And I\u2019m in the sweet spot.\u201d She pops her tongue. Click. In April, she constructed a crossword for the New York Times herself. \u201cI have become someone who thinks in clues, who jokes in puzzles and who lives for the answers,\u201d she wrote. Clues included: \u201cPoehler vortex of funniness?\u201d The answer being \u201cAmy\u201d, co-creator of Russian Doll (the series came about after Poehler called her and said: \u201cYou know, as long as I\u2019ve known you, you\u2019ve always been the oldest girl in the world.\u201d) Another was \u201cPortlandia airer\u201d, about her partner Fred Armisen\u2019s sketch series, and one of the last was, \u201cWhere one might kick a habit, informally\u201d: Rehab. For her 40th birthday that same month, she wanted to celebrate in a way that would give her guests the \u201csensation their brain was melting,\u201d but that is a tricky ask, sober. Her solution was to rent two cinemas, one in New York, where she screened The King of Comedy, and one in LA, where she screened Lina Wertm\u00fcller\u2019s Seven Beauties. Did her friends appreciate it? She shrugs. \u201cIt was good for them!\u201d she shouts. As she\u2019s got older, rather than simply moving forward, she gives a sense of having circled back around the tangerine, to reassess unusual moments of childhood. In Russian Doll, Lyonne\u2019s character Nadia dies, and dies, and dies again, reappearing in front of the same mirror each time, to try and unlock the puzzle box of mortality. When she sat down to watch the whole series, Lyonne was struck by, \u201cHow much the show was unintentionally about suicide. About not \u2018taking yourself out\u2019. And I think that there are so many ways in which we can take ourselves out of our lives, you know, even just by stopping participating. I found myself crying at the heaviness of it. Anthony Bourdain had just killed himself and I felt overwhelmed that the show was really speaking to the search for a meaningful life. But, simultaneously, acknowledging we all feel sort of strange and dirty, and perplexed by what we\u2019re doing here. And you know, that here were these characters willing each other to\u2026 stick around.\u201d In Lyonne\u2019s life, clues from her past flash now in neon. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting is that there was this person I abandoned for almost two decades, who knew exactly who I would emerge to be.\u201d She realised recently that she has been trying to write Russian Doll since she was a child. \u201cAt 16, I already knew who I was. But then had just the most insane waylaid life where at every turn, I was my own worst enemy. Then I reappeared, to tell that story.\u201d She chuckles. \u201cI\u2019m a letter of hope for weirdos who are having a hard time in high school, right? The very same things I was attacked for back then are the very same things that are now being rewarded.\u201d At 16, enrolling at NYU, \u201cI was like, \u2018I\u2019m going to make a comedy about, you know, [Jean-Paul Sartre\u2019s] No Exit and Viktor Frankl\u2019s Man\u2019s Search for Meaning. A comedy about drama and the legacy of trauma.\u2019 I was like: \u2018This is going to be a funny half hour.\u2019 Russian Doll is coming from that natural, internal world. And no one is more surprised than me that things turned out so well. And, of course, I really have the perspective now to know that really, these are the good years. This is kind of as good as it gets.\u201d A large part of this long-time-coming success, she says, is down to Orange is the New Black. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very healing environment for me for seven years.\u201d The cast and crew had \u201cbeen through too many international time zones on too little sleep to lie to each other. I could just say, \u2018I think I\u2019m miserable\u2019, and there would be something in saying that that would defuse it. The magic of the truth and of a safe environment. Instead of constantly trying to lead a life of a cover-ups.\u201d It showed her safety and it showed her a different way to work and, then, live. \u201cA less performance-based life, where I could be moving through with a little bit more authenticity. Instead of leading a life where I was constantly convinced I was broken, and that I had to hide that from you. I was starting to be like: \u201cOh, wait a minute, everybody\u2019s fucked up and broken. They just had better parenting, so better tools for hiding it.\u2019\u201d She pauses. \u201cBut I was also slowly discovering that, increasingly, I was an authority in the room. That a lot of people would be looking to me as somebody who had more information, more years on set, more experience. I was like: \u2018I\u2019m kind of becoming an elder.\u2019\u201d She liked it. She liked it when she was invited to direct an episode in the final series, too. This is a show whose themes have run uncomfortably close to the headlines, from the death of a black inmate to this season\u2019s focus on immigration detention centres, subjects Lyonne wants to humanise. \u201cBeing trusted with an episode was very\u2026 life affirming. I\u2019d never graduated high school, I\u2019d never graduated college, I\u2019d never graduated a family, or relationship. My family was left in tatters. So there wasn\u2019t really a sense of closure, even when my parents died. There\u2019s no scenes in any of the deaths in my family that are like, by a hospital bed, with people saying sorry. It was more sudden, with traumatic phone calls. So I never really had that experience of saying goodbye to anything in a healthy way, until now. I guess I\u2019d never, in many ways, really understood the concept of unconditional love until Orange.\u201d She nods with the realisation, \u201cHuh.\u201d Watching Orange is the New Black I had the growing realisation that women shouldn\u2019t go to prison. In the UK, 85% are there for non-violent offences, yet it takes barely weeks inside for them to lose their kids. Almost half committed their offence in order to support the drug use of someone else, and most are addicts themselves. Prison does not work. \u201cI agree,\u201d she says. \u201cCompletely. I mean, in many ways, I\u2019m very grateful I had such a public addiction story, you know? Sure, I find it tedious that 13 years later, people still want to talk about it as if it\u2019s \u2018juicy\u2019. To me, what is more interesting about it is that I never feel like anybody in that position is a stranger to me. \u201cWhen I first started on Orange I\u2019d never served time, but I\u2019d definitely been arrested enough times. And, you know, the idea I was somebody in the system, who is now \u2018the star\u2019 of Netflix shows, is pretty insane, and makes you think about how we should be treating individual cases, rather than just punishing everybody. Especially in that space between release and acclimating to society, this murky terrain, without hope. How to get people back into society, how to get back to life.\u201d In the final season we see Piper, our original antiheroine, released from Litchfield to find herself free, but in new kinds of chains. \u201cBut you know, I agree with you. I find it devastating that prisoners are victims of sexual abuse or physical violence, or drug addicts. Look, the reason anybody\u2019s addicted to drugs or, you know, their cell phones in the first place is because they\u2019re constantly trying to process trauma, and find a moment\u2019s relief.\u201d Lyonne squeezes half a lemon into a glass of ice as if she\u2019s wringing its neck. \u201cThey\u2019re not doing it because they\u2019re stupid, or bad people. To then punish them for having an internal experience that is inherently punishing, is so malicious. So without grace. So brutal.\u201d Again a waiter comes, and again, he goes. Every morning, Lyonne goes to the gym. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m sporty, I\u2019m very sporty, you don\u2019t believe me? When I was a kid I went to an Israeli army training programme where I would shoot an M16.\u201d But, just as at school where she\u2019d adhere to the dress code, but wear it skin-tight and with spike heels, she rebels. \u201cI always try to be late. And I don\u2019t wear gym clothes. I\u2019m wearing, like, Gucci loafers, sunglasses, chains. And I\u2019m late. I don\u2019t like the whole intro chapter in any class. There\u2019s a lot of small talk. I hate small talk.\u201d And today, she works harder than ever, but on her own terms. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why people always want to shoot at five in the morning? They\u2019re obsessed with daylight. But you know who\u2019s not obsessed with daylight? Dracula. Right. And he\u2019s been alive a long time. So who\u2019s winning that war, hmm?\u201d Part of her career upsurge, she believes, is due to the world getting worse: there is a need for entertainment that does more than make us laugh. \u201cYou have this movement that\u2019s in revolt, saying, \u2018We want to hear people\u2019s stories, we want to go right to the source for the truth. And otherwise, we\u2019re going to call it out as a lie.\u2019\u201d She tells me about a book she\u2019s reading by a Swedish professor that proves humankind is doing better than ever before, but even as she says it, the turn of her mouth suggests she finds it hard to believe. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of very bad news out there. Like there\u2019s a lot of evidence to support that things are very, very bleak. And, in fact, mounting in that direction.\u201d She looks at her phone, then, groaning, turns it over. \u201cBut even as we\u2019re aware of horrors mounting, we\u2019re also constantly distracted. The same device that\u2019s giving us all this insider information, in real time, is also, you know, constantly showing us cat videos.\u201d Which is what she tweets, a lot, along with dancing penguins and, the day after we meet, a link to a montage titled: \u201cHow Debbie Harry Learned to Deal With Superficial, Demeaning Interviewers.\u201d Soon after forming her new production company with old friend Maya Rudolph she sent her a YouTube link to a time-lapse video of the end of the world. \u201cIt fucked me up,\u201d Rudolph said, mildly. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Lyonne sighs today, \u201cI do think that these are legitimately scary times. But, I\u2019m wired for hope. In many ways, the reason I\u2019m not dead is because there\u2019s a fighter in me that wants to survive. And see, well, maybe not a happy ending, but at least a meaningful one.\u201d The last heart, gone.

      "body": "<p>Aged 17, broke and living alone, Emily Thornberry had a number of low-paid jobs. She was a barmaid at the Hammersmith Palais; there was also a stint in a factory stacking boxes and folding cards. Neither of these youthful experiences, however, has proved quite as indelible as the time she spent as a cleaner on the Townsend Thoresen ferry from Dover to Zeebrugge. The crossing was often rocky and as, a result, passengers were frequently sick. On one occasion, she arrived dutifully at the loos, mop and bucket in hand, only to find every last basin and lavatory pebble-dashed with vomit. What did she do? Was she tempted to make a sudden break for the upper deck and fill her lungs with the North Sea breeze? No, not a bit of it. \u201cI quietly locked the door behind me and I just got on with it,\u201d she says, wrinkling her nose.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to resist making a metaphor out of this anecdote, given that many people are wondering for how much longer the vast majority of Labour MPs intend to put up with the stench that currently rises from their party. Our meeting takes place in Thornberry\u2019s constituency office in Islington a week after the screening of the <em>Panorama</em> programme in which former Labour staffers alleged that key Labour figures had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/15/labour-staffers-letter-jeremy-corbyn-whistleblowers\" title=\"\">interfered with investigations into complaints of anti</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/15/labour-staffers-letter-jeremy-corbyn-whistleblowers\" title=\"\">semitism</a> in the party: a period of days during which, to put it mildly, quite a lot has happened. A group of MPs, among them Yvette Cooper and Stephen Kinnock, has urged the party\u2019s national executive committee to set up an independent investigation into the allegations. Some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/15/labour-staffers-letter-jeremy-corbyn-whistleblowers\">200 former and current Labour party staff, members and supporters</a> have challenged Corbyn to resign if he cannot renew trust in its dealings with its employees (the whistleblowers had to break nondisclosure agreements in order to speak out). Sixty Labour peers \u2013 a full third of the party\u2019s members in the Lords \u2013 have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/16/tom-watson-backs-labour-motion-auto-exclude-racism\" title=\"\">taken out an advert</a> accusing Corbyn of having \u201cfailed the test of leadership\u201d. The atmosphere grows more febrile by the minute.</p> <p>And yet, at the top, the denial goes on; pegs are still on noses. On social media, elements of the party have attacked both the BBC and the whistleblowers, rather than focusing on the allegations themselves. Jeremy Corbyn has spoken of the programme\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/13/corbyn-decries-bbcs-inaccuracies-over-labour-antisemitism\" title=\"\">\u201cmany, many inaccuracies\u201d</a>. Labour has demanded that it be removed from the iPlayer (a request the BBC has refused). Len McCluskey, the leader of the Unite union, has called Tom Watson, the deputy leader of Labour, \u201ca fucking disgrace\u201d for having dared to criticise Jennie Formby, Labour\u2019s general secretary, while she is undergoing chemotherapy.</p> <p>There is a feeling that something has to give, but it\u2019s hard to see what exactly this might be. For while an MP such as Thornberry, who is shadow foreign secretary, talks of the \u201cdistress\u201d the programme caused her, she will not countenance my use of the c-word \u2013 complicity \u2013 to describe her ongoing support for Corbyn, whom she insists is \u201cvery distressed\u201d by the allegations. Though some believe that the buck for all this stops with him and that he needs to go, she is adamant \u2013 at this point, feel free to picture a can of air freshener \u2013 that not only will \u201cgood, decent\u201d Corbyn lead the party into the next election, but that he can, and will, win it. \u201cWe\u2019re the MPs for Islington,\u201d she says when I ask about her relationship with the leader, an old photograph of whom can be seen on the half-empty pinboard behind her (his hair still long and brown, he brings to mind swinging Howard Kirk in Malcolm Bradbury\u2019s campus novel <em>The History Man</em>). \u201cWe\u2019re close.\u201d Doesn\u2019t she feel let down by him? \u201cI think that\u2026\u201d For a second, she hesitates. \u201cHe took too long to make some important decisions. I felt disappointed that we took as long as we did to accept the international definition of antisemitism [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/04/labour-adopts-ihra-antisemitism-definition-in-full\" title=\"\">Labour adopted the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition in full in 2018</a>]. But that was because he found the issue of antisemitism distressing; he was accused of it and he just isn\u2019t antisemitic in my view. I do know how very hard this is for him.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0dc54fe72e2660fa8bf58338049b85532b00b341\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0dc54fe72e2660fa8bf58338049b85532b00b341/0_0_2733_1951/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thornberry with Jeremy Corbyn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thornberry with Jeremy Corbyn: \u2018We\u2019re the MPs for Islington.

The personal testimonies of the young Labour staffers, who spoke of the effect of their treatment by party officials on their mental health, upset her deeply. But she also felt that the programme did not accurately reflect recent changes to processes that have been made. Nevertheless, as she notes quietly: \u201cIt goes on and on\u2026\u201d</p> <p>What, then, is she going to do about it, apart, that is, from taking the trouble to appear on <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/14/end-the-antisemitism-soap-opera-emily-thornberry-tells-labour\" title=\"\">The Andrew Marr </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/14/end-the-antisemitism-soap-opera-emily-thornberry-tells-labour\" title=\"\">Show</a></em>? (She said that Labour must allow the Equality and Human Rights Commission, currently investigating the party over allegations of antisemitism, free rein to reform its mechanisms for dealing with complaints.) Isn\u2019t there a sense that, for some on the left, the allegations are regarded as hysteria, as simply a weapon with which to attack its leader? And that while these attitudes go unchallenged by that leader and his acolytes, nothing will change? But she doesn\u2019t<strong> </strong>agree. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair,\u201d she says. \u201cI think some<strong> </strong>of them have been slower to understand how serious it is. I think it\u2019s right that there were people who were dragging their feet initially and who hid behind the fact that antisemitism in Labour may be no greater than it is in the Conservatives or the rest of society. But while I\u2019m ashamed that the EHRC is doing an investigation, the only piece of hope is that maybe together we can work out a new system, a robust system, an example of good practice.\u201d</p> <p>Beyond this she will not go. Do not expect the drama of resignation or departure from her. \u201cI am very lawyerly about this,\u201d she says (Thornberry was previously a barrister). \u201cWe either have politicians interfering or we don\u2019t. If we are going to have a quasi-judicial process, which I think is the right thing to do, that doesn\u2019t sit with politicians being involved. I am torn about it. I really do want to get involved, but we also have a structural thing, which is that the NEC is in charge of the Labour party, and I\u2019m not on the NEC. What I\u2019ve tried to do throughout this period is to keep connections with the Jewish community \u2013 I go to everything I\u2019m invited to \u2013 and to try and steer a line on our foreign policy that is reasonable, robust and even-handed and that is very difficult with issues like the Middle East, which is quite often a spur for a lot of this [antisemitism on the left].\u201d</p> <p>Is Corbyn badly advised? Are those who surround him the problem? \u201cI don\u2019t want to go into that. I can speak on the record and advisers can\u2019t. It\u2019s not right for me to say things against them and for them not to be able to answer back.\u201d How would she describe her relationship with Seumas Milne, the party\u2019s director of strategy? (Milne is one of those accused of having interfered in the antisemitism cases.) \u201cI don\u2019t know. I think it\u2019s fine. Seumas is very charming. I\u2019m sure that anyone who watches closely can see that we disagree, but these things are done behind closed doors and it wouldn\u2019t be right for me to comment on them.\u201d What about Tom Watson, increasingly critical of Corbyn and those around him? \u201cI don\u2019t really know Tom.\u201d On <em>Marr</em>, she, like McCluskey, insisted that Watson was wrong to criticise Jennie Formby. Didn\u2019t she think it was a bit cheap of McCluskey to deploy Formby\u2019s cancer in the way that he did? (Margaret Hodge, a Jewish MP, has said that her illness has been \u201cweaponised\u201d.) \u201cI think she\u2019s\u2026 a really extraordinary woman. She\u2019s having chemotherapy, but nevertheless she is doing what she can and she went to shadow cabinet last week; she took a break from her chemo and gave a presentation on antisemitism and what was happening. I asked her some questions. She looked glorious, but she had no hair, and we know how ill she is, and from what I can remember Tom didn\u2019t ask her any questions \u2013 and then he writes a public letter having a go at her. On a human level, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s right.\u201d Perhaps it\u2019s worth noting here that McCluskey, who has a child with Formby and who is also bound to play an important role in any future leadership contest, is said to be a fan of Thornberry\u2019s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"938ccb32acb1d33574c493fd375be893aa6a73bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/938ccb32acb1d33574c493fd375be893aa6a73bd/0_342_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On the road with Labour Remain battle bus\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On the road with Labour Remain battle bus in Birmingham, June 2016, with fellow MPs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Is she on manoeuvres? She insists that she isn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019m not plotting. You can ask all parliament. I want a Labour government and I want to be foreign secretary in that government and I think I will be bloody good at it.\u201d But I\u2019m not sure. It\u2019s interesting how visible she has made herself lately. <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/labour-party/house/house-magazine/105242/unparliamentary-language-emily\" title=\"\">A jolly interview about her children\u2019s pet rats</a> in the House of Commons magazine one day, an appearance on <em>Marr</em> the next. Some will observe that she is well placed to appeal to a wide cross\u2011section of the party; she supported Yvette Cooper as a candidate for the leadership in 2015, but ever since has served under Corbyn, remaining, through thick and thin, supportive of him. There\u2019s something straightforward about the way that she tells me, just before I leave, that it\u2019s \u201cabout time\u201d the Labour party had a female leader.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6db58c0a019d3d6fb1771622d2c20d17b655e1fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6db58c0a019d3d6fb1771622d2c20d17b655e1fb/309_0_4710_2827/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thornberry debating the leak of Kim Darroch\u2019s emails in parliament.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thornberry debating the leak of Kim Darroch\u2019s emails in parliament.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal News And Sport (Europe)</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Above all, there is her change of heart on Brexit. Having supported Remain during the referendum campaign, once Britain had voted to leave, she was firm. Though she insists she can\u2019t remember saying this now, she accused pro-EU Labour MPs of being part of an \u201c<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-party-brexit-emily-thornberry-chuku-uminna-eu-referendum-a8410546.html\" title=\"\">increasing normalisation of dishonesty</a>\u201d. She had, she said, no time for rebel MPs who \u201cprance\u201d in the media, demanding opposition to Brexit. But then, on the night of the European elections, in which Labour did so badly, and the Liberal Democrats did so well \u2013 in Islington, they beat Labour \u2013 there she was on the television, claiming that Labour should have said that any deal offered on Brexit by the current government should be put to a confirmatory referendum, that Remain should be on the ballot paper and that Labour <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/27/corbyn-pressed-by-senior-labour-mps-to-back-a-second-referendum\" title=\"\">should campaign to </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/27/corbyn-pressed-by-senior-labour-mps-to-back-a-second-referendum\" title=\"\">stay in the EU</a>. (If she received a telling-off for this from the leadership, it hardly matters now, for this is the position since adopted by the party.)</p> <p>\u201cYeah, well,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is how it goes. I campaigned wholeheartedly to remain, but I thought we were going to lose. I went on a bus around the country and we would get Labour MPs coming on it in order to campaign in other people\u2019s constituencies because they didn\u2019t want to campaign in their own; they didn\u2019t want to upset their constituents. I thought, \u2018Oh, God. People don\u2019t realise how bad this is\u2019, and we did lose and I was very upset. However, we live in a democracy and I have to do what I am told.\u201d Her hope was that we would leave, but not \u201cgo too far\u201d, a means of respecting the votes of the 48% as well as the 52%. But the government\u2019s negotiation never passed Labour\u2019s so-called tests and now here we are, facing \u201cno deal on one extreme and no Brexit on the other\u201d. For this reason, she thinks Labour should be building the barricades for remaining. \u201cWe need to be truthful [to Labour Leave voters]. We need to tell people that what the Tories are trying to do is different to what they were promised and that we want to check back with them and have another referendum. We need to say that we have run out of other options and that we are sorry.\u201d Is it nice to wake up in the morning and know that she can speak out in favour of Remain again? You can almost see her shoulders drop. \u201cOf course. Because it\u2019s in accordance with what I want anyway.\u201d</p> <p>What does she think is going to happen in the next few months? \u201cIf anyone says they know, they\u2019re lying. But we should prepare for an election in the autumn. I don\u2019t think he [Boris Johnson] can leave with no deal without either a referendum or a general election. The consequences for the country are so dreadful they will never be forgiven. You can\u2019t do something so extreme as a minority party, and with a leader who has been elected largely by elderly people from the home counties of limited background and experience of life, without going back to the people. He might go for an election if he is way ahead in the polls, but he\u2019s so unpredictable; he might also have the chutzpah to ask the people to choose between no deal and Remain.\u201d How would that go? \u201cIt\u2019s unpredictable. But I learned this weekend that no one who was born in the 21st century voted in the referendum \u2013 isn\u2019t that amazing? \u2013 and it\u2019s all about them and their future and they have a clear idea of what they want. I would say a narrow win for Remain, but it can\u2019t be guaranteed.\u201d</p> <p>On television, Thornberry can come over as patronising. What works at the dispatch box \u2013 masterful when covering for Corbyn at prime minister\u2019s questions; she once witheringly described the cabinet\u2019s handling of Brexit as \u201c<em>Reservoir Dogs</em> remade by the Chuckle Brothers\u201d \u2013 doesn\u2019t always seem quite right away from the bear pit. But in person, she is as warm as any politician I\u2019ve ever met, and pretty human too. There is something ebullient about her, an energy that goes undimmed in spite of the political madness that is all around. Am I right about this? She seems \u2013 to be blunt \u2013 to be far less depressed about everything than me and I can\u2019t work out why this should be. \u201cYes,\u201d she says, quietly. After this, she is silent for longer than at any time in our conversation, until she finally adds: \u201cI have had some pretty hard times in my life, and I have got through them, and it is important to remember that: you are stronger than you think. Keep going. I feel people\u2019s hopes are pinned on me. I have got to keep going. But I am fairly robust.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"819216287783b4150ceea4d0e0d69251d7baccba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/819216287783b4150ceea4d0e0d69251d7baccba/0_25_2629_3286/800.jpg\" alt=\"Thornberry with her husband, Christopher Nugee.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thornberry with her husband, Christopher Nugee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Parsons / i-Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She credits some of this buoyancy to her husband, Christopher Nugee, a high court judge. They met when she was 22 and still at bar school (she\u2019d attended not knowing what else to do and because she was able to get a grant for it). She grins. \u201cYes, an A1 husband. I was very angry then: chippy. I was finding it difficult to find my way. I was deeply lacking in self-confidence.\u201d She used to play bridge with him and he was a generous partner. When she put down her terrible hand, he would compliment her on it nevertheless and then go on to win anyway. \u201cHe was clever and kind\u2026 and his big blue eyes.\u201d They married when she was 30. \u201cIt took me a long time to be persuaded that he wasn\u2019t going to leave me. But he just loved me and he has continued to do so. He has given me huge stability and support.\u201d</p> <p>She and the public school and Oxford-educated Nugee were from wildly different backgrounds, though not all of this comes down to social class. It\u2019s more complicated than that. Thornberry, who was born in Guildford in 1960, is from a solidly middle-class background: her father, later assistant secretary general of the United Nations, was a Cambridge-educated barrister; her mother was a teacher and a Labour councillor. But her early life is imprinted with a dramatic \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d: when she was seven, her father left her mother for another woman and the family\u2019s situation changed radically. Her mother moved into a council house and Thornberry and her siblings had free school meals; early on, they were so broke that \u2013 according to legend \u2013 their cats were put down. \u201cIt was a different time,\u201d she says. \u201cIt [divorce] didn\u2019t happen then.\u201d It wasn\u2019t shameful, exactly. But it was unusual enough for comment and her mother felt it. She would sit up late, telling Emily how terrible her father was.</p> <p>Is is true about the cats? \u201cYes, it is true,\u201d she says. That suggests a catastrophe, doesn\u2019t it, and of a kind that would form a person utterly? \u201cYes,\u201d she says, again. \u201cAnd there was a double whammy. When I was 15, I had a row with my mum, and I went to live with my dad in Hammersmith, and one day, he went to New York and he never came back [he\u2019d had a job offer from the UN]. Suddenly, I was on my own in London. When you\u2019re 17, you live with it, but when I was the mother of a 17-year-old myself, I became furious about it. How irresponsible.\u201d Naturally, she couldn\u2019t go back to her mother. \u201cI couldn\u2019t admit to her what was going on. My pride was at stake.\u201d Was she lonely? \u201cI was <em>terribly</em> lonely.\u201d Did her father feel guilty? \u201cI don\u2019t know. He never told me that he felt guilty.\u201d</p> <p>Their father\u2019s abandonment affected his children in different ways. \u201cHe had six children. I have two full brothers, a half-brother who died and two half-sisters. They all had strong criticisms of him. Dad came back, having been away for decades, with dementia, and had to be looked after. My brother found a care home, but having done that, he said: right, that\u2019s it. I was the one who had to go and see him. I saw him disintegrate. He wasn\u2019t someone who lived on other people\u2019s emotions. He was self-contained and never complained; his wives and girlfriends would tell me what was going on in his life. But it was terrible to see. He would talk about it. He would say he felt he was drowning in the sea, the waves coming over him, that he was disappearing. I had to go and see him and to begin with, I really resented it \u2013 that he had disappeared with so little involvement in our lives and now he expected us to look after him. But as he disintegrated in front of me, I just felt great pity for him and great love for him. I thought: you\u2019re an old bastard, but I do love you.</p> <p>\u201cWhen he died, I was really sad, whereas my brothers turned up at the funeral raging. They still felt the same anger. Some of my siblings, if they were honest, would say they still suffer from the way he treated them. But I am all right. He was a great man, but he was terribly flawed as a father.\u201d The awareness she\u2019d had during his illness that visiting him would save her in the end \u2013 that this was important emotional work \u2013 turned out to be right. \u201cIt helped me. It absolutely helped me. That was the point. My attitude to his death was calm, peaceful, balanced.\u201d Her voice is very low now, but there is no self-pity in it or even much sadness. All this has made her what she is \u2013 it\u2019s a part of her \u2013 and she knows it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5de6d8eec38504b6b542c147e0fb37083c0148b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5de6d8eec38504b6b542c147e0fb37083c0148b1/0_28_1969_1181/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Canvassing in 2005, the year she was first elected to parliament\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Canvassing in 2005, the year she was first elected to parliament, following an unsuccessful 2001 campaign in Canterbury.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bridget Jones</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thornberry failed her 11-plus and was bullied at her secondary modern. Her teachers had no hopes for her. But, alone in London, working as a cleaner and a barmaid, she resat her O-levels, took her A-levels and won a place to read law at the University of Kent. After bar school, she joined Michael Mansfield\u2019s chambers.

      "bodyText": "Aged 17, broke and living alone, Emily Thornberry had a number of low-paid jobs. She was a barmaid at the Hammersmith Palais; there was also a stint in a factory stacking boxes and folding cards. Neither of these youthful experiences, however, has proved quite as indelible as the time she spent as a cleaner on the Townsend Thoresen ferry from Dover to Zeebrugge. The crossing was often rocky and as, a result, passengers were frequently sick. On one occasion, she arrived dutifully at the loos, mop and bucket in hand, only to find every last basin and lavatory pebble-dashed with vomit. What did she do? Was she tempted to make a sudden break for the upper deck and fill her lungs with the North Sea breeze? No, not a bit of it. \u201cI quietly locked the door behind me and I just got on with it,\u201d she says, wrinkling her nose. It\u2019s hard to resist making a metaphor out of this anecdote, given that many people are wondering for how much longer the vast majority of Labour MPs intend to put up with the stench that currently rises from their party. Our meeting takes place in Thornberry\u2019s constituency office in Islington a week after the screening of the Panorama programme in which former Labour staffers alleged that key Labour figures had interfered with investigations into complaints of antisemitism in the party: a period of days during which, to put it mildly, quite a lot has happened. A group of MPs, among them Yvette Cooper and Stephen Kinnock, has urged the party\u2019s national executive committee to set up an independent investigation into the allegations. Some 200 former and current Labour party staff, members and supporters have challenged Corbyn to resign if he cannot renew trust in its dealings with its employees (the whistleblowers had to break nondisclosure agreements in order to speak out). Sixty Labour peers \u2013 a full third of the party\u2019s members in the Lords \u2013 have taken out an advert accusing Corbyn of having \u201cfailed the test of leadership\u201d. The atmosphere grows more febrile by the minute. And yet, at the top, the denial goes on; pegs are still on noses. On social media, elements of the party have attacked both the BBC and the whistleblowers, rather than focusing on the allegations themselves. Jeremy Corbyn has spoken of the programme\u2019s \u201cmany, many inaccuracies\u201d. Labour has demanded that it be removed from the iPlayer (a request the BBC has refused). Len McCluskey, the leader of the Unite union, has called Tom Watson, the deputy leader of Labour, \u201ca fucking disgrace\u201d for having dared to criticise Jennie Formby, Labour\u2019s general secretary, while she is undergoing chemotherapy. There is a feeling that something has to give, but it\u2019s hard to see what exactly this might be. For while an MP such as Thornberry, who is shadow foreign secretary, talks of the \u201cdistress\u201d the programme caused her, she will not countenance my use of the c-word \u2013 complicity \u2013 to describe her ongoing support for Corbyn, whom she insists is \u201cvery distressed\u201d by the allegations. Though some believe that the buck for all this stops with him and that he needs to go, she is adamant \u2013 at this point, feel free to picture a can of air freshener \u2013 that not only will \u201cgood, decent\u201d Corbyn lead the party into the next election, but that he can, and will, win it. \u201cWe\u2019re the MPs for Islington,\u201d she says when I ask about her relationship with the leader, an old photograph of whom can be seen on the half-empty pinboard behind her (his hair still long and brown, he brings to mind swinging Howard Kirk in Malcolm Bradbury\u2019s campus novel The History Man). \u201cWe\u2019re close.\u201d Doesn\u2019t she feel let down by him? \u201cI think that\u2026\u201d For a second, she hesitates. \u201cHe took too long to make some important decisions. I felt disappointed that we took as long as we did to accept the international definition of antisemitism [Labour adopted the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition in full in 2018]. But that was because he found the issue of antisemitism distressing; he was accused of it and he just isn\u2019t antisemitic in my view. I do know how very hard this is for him.\u201d Thornberry watched Panorama at home with her husband and daughter. The personal testimonies of the young Labour staffers, who spoke of the effect of their treatment by party officials on their mental health, upset her deeply. But she also felt that the programme did not accurately reflect recent changes to processes that have been made. Nevertheless, as she notes quietly: \u201cIt goes on and on\u2026\u201d What, then, is she going to do about it, apart, that is, from taking the trouble to appear on The Andrew Marr Show? (She said that Labour must allow the Equality and Human Rights Commission, currently investigating the party over allegations of antisemitism, free rein to reform its mechanisms for dealing with complaints.) Isn\u2019t there a sense that, for some on the left, the allegations are regarded as hysteria, as simply a weapon with which to attack its leader? And that while these attitudes go unchallenged by that leader and his acolytes, nothing will change? But she doesn\u2019t agree. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair,\u201d she says. \u201cI think some of them have been slower to understand how serious it is. I think it\u2019s right that there were people who were dragging their feet initially and who hid behind the fact that antisemitism in Labour may be no greater than it is in the Conservatives or the rest of society. But while I\u2019m ashamed that the EHRC is doing an investigation, the only piece of hope is that maybe together we can work out a new system, a robust system, an example of good practice.\u201d Beyond this she will not go. Do not expect the drama of resignation or departure from her. \u201cI am very lawyerly about this,\u201d she says (Thornberry was previously a barrister). \u201cWe either have politicians interfering or we don\u2019t. If we are going to have a quasi-judicial process, which I think is the right thing to do, that doesn\u2019t sit with politicians being involved. I am torn about it. I really do want to get involved, but we also have a structural thing, which is that the NEC is in charge of the Labour party, and I\u2019m not on the NEC. What I\u2019ve tried to do throughout this period is to keep connections with the Jewish community \u2013 I go to everything I\u2019m invited to \u2013 and to try and steer a line on our foreign policy that is reasonable, robust and even-handed and that is very difficult with issues like the Middle East, which is quite often a spur for a lot of this [antisemitism on the left].\u201d Is Corbyn badly advised? Are those who surround him the problem? \u201cI don\u2019t want to go into that. I can speak on the record and advisers can\u2019t. It\u2019s not right for me to say things against them and for them not to be able to answer back.\u201d How would she describe her relationship with Seumas Milne, the party\u2019s director of strategy? (Milne is one of those accused of having interfered in the antisemitism cases.) \u201cI don\u2019t know. I think it\u2019s fine. Seumas is very charming. I\u2019m sure that anyone who watches closely can see that we disagree, but these things are done behind closed doors and it wouldn\u2019t be right for me to comment on them.\u201d What about Tom Watson, increasingly critical of Corbyn and those around him? \u201cI don\u2019t really know Tom.\u201d On Marr, she, like McCluskey, insisted that Watson was wrong to criticise Jennie Formby. Didn\u2019t she think it was a bit cheap of McCluskey to deploy Formby\u2019s cancer in the way that he did? (Margaret Hodge, a Jewish MP, has said that her illness has been \u201cweaponised\u201d.) \u201cI think she\u2019s\u2026 a really extraordinary woman. She\u2019s having chemotherapy, but nevertheless she is doing what she can and she went to shadow cabinet last week; she took a break from her chemo and gave a presentation on antisemitism and what was happening. I asked her some questions. She looked glorious, but she had no hair, and we know how ill she is, and from what I can remember Tom didn\u2019t ask her any questions \u2013 and then he writes a public letter having a go at her. On a human level, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s right.\u201d Perhaps it\u2019s worth noting here that McCluskey, who has a child with Formby and who is also bound to play an important role in any future leadership contest, is said to be a fan of Thornberry\u2019s. Is she on manoeuvres? She insists that she isn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019m not plotting. You can ask all parliament. I want a Labour government and I want to be foreign secretary in that government and I think I will be bloody good at it.\u201d But I\u2019m not sure. It\u2019s interesting how visible she has made herself lately. A jolly interview about her children\u2019s pet rats in the House of Commons magazine one day, an appearance on Marr the next. Some will observe that she is well placed to appeal to a wide cross\u2011section of the party; she supported Yvette Cooper as a candidate for the leadership in 2015, but ever since has served under Corbyn, remaining, through thick and thin, supportive of him. There\u2019s something straightforward about the way that she tells me, just before I leave, that it\u2019s \u201cabout time\u201d the Labour party had a female leader. Above all, there is her change of heart on Brexit. Having supported Remain during the referendum campaign, once Britain had voted to leave, she was firm. Though she insists she can\u2019t remember saying this now, she accused pro-EU Labour MPs of being part of an \u201cincreasing normalisation of dishonesty\u201d. She had, she said, no time for rebel MPs who \u201cprance\u201d in the media, demanding opposition to Brexit. But then, on the night of the European elections, in which Labour did so badly, and the Liberal Democrats did so well \u2013 in Islington, they beat Labour \u2013 there she was on the television, claiming that Labour should have said that any deal offered on Brexit by the current government should be put to a confirmatory referendum, that Remain should be on the ballot paper and that Labour should campaign to stay in the EU. (If she received a telling-off for this from the leadership, it hardly matters now, for this is the position since adopted by the party.) \u201cYeah, well,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is how it goes. I campaigned wholeheartedly to remain, but I thought we were going to lose. I went on a bus around the country and we would get Labour MPs coming on it in order to campaign in other people\u2019s constituencies because they didn\u2019t want to campaign in their own; they didn\u2019t want to upset their constituents. I thought, \u2018Oh, God. People don\u2019t realise how bad this is\u2019, and we did lose and I was very upset. However, we live in a democracy and I have to do what I am told.\u201d Her hope was that we would leave, but not \u201cgo too far\u201d, a means of respecting the votes of the 48% as well as the 52%. But the government\u2019s negotiation never passed Labour\u2019s so-called tests and now here we are, facing \u201cno deal on one extreme and no Brexit on the other\u201d. For this reason, she thinks Labour should be building the barricades for remaining. \u201cWe need to be truthful [to Labour Leave voters]. We need to tell people that what the Tories are trying to do is different to what they were promised and that we want to check back with them and have another referendum. We need to say that we have run out of other options and that we are sorry.\u201d Is it nice to wake up in the morning and know that she can speak out in favour of Remain again? You can almost see her shoulders drop. \u201cOf course. Because it\u2019s in accordance with what I want anyway.\u201d What does she think is going to happen in the next few months? \u201cIf anyone says they know, they\u2019re lying. But we should prepare for an election in the autumn. I don\u2019t think he [Boris Johnson] can leave with no deal without either a referendum or a general election. The consequences for the country are so dreadful they will never be forgiven. You can\u2019t do something so extreme as a minority party, and with a leader who has been elected largely by elderly people from the home counties of limited background and experience of life, without going back to the people. He might go for an election if he is way ahead in the polls, but he\u2019s so unpredictable; he might also have the chutzpah to ask the people to choose between no deal and Remain.\u201d How would that go? \u201cIt\u2019s unpredictable. But I learned this weekend that no one who was born in the 21st century voted in the referendum \u2013 isn\u2019t that amazing? \u2013 and it\u2019s all about them and their future and they have a clear idea of what they want. I would say a narrow win for Remain, but it can\u2019t be guaranteed.\u201d On television, Thornberry can come over as patronising. What works at the dispatch box \u2013 masterful when covering for Corbyn at prime minister\u2019s questions; she once witheringly described the cabinet\u2019s handling of Brexit as \u201cReservoir Dogs remade by the Chuckle Brothers\u201d \u2013 doesn\u2019t always seem quite right away from the bear pit. But in person, she is as warm as any politician I\u2019ve ever met, and pretty human too. There is something ebullient about her, an energy that goes undimmed in spite of the political madness that is all around. Am I right about this? She seems \u2013 to be blunt \u2013 to be far less depressed about everything than me and I can\u2019t work out why this should be. \u201cYes,\u201d she says, quietly. After this, she is silent for longer than at any time in our conversation, until she finally adds: \u201cI have had some pretty hard times in my life, and I have got through them, and it is important to remember that: you are stronger than you think. Keep going. I feel people\u2019s hopes are pinned on me. I have got to keep going. But I am fairly robust.\u201d She credits some of this buoyancy to her husband, Christopher Nugee, a high court judge. They met when she was 22 and still at bar school (she\u2019d attended not knowing what else to do and because she was able to get a grant for it). She grins. \u201cYes, an A1 husband. I was very angry then: chippy. I was finding it difficult to find my way. I was deeply lacking in self-confidence.\u201d She used to play bridge with him and he was a generous partner. When she put down her terrible hand, he would compliment her on it nevertheless and then go on to win anyway. \u201cHe was clever and kind\u2026 and his big blue eyes.\u201d They married when she was 30. \u201cIt took me a long time to be persuaded that he wasn\u2019t going to leave me. But he just loved me and he has continued to do so. He has given me huge stability and support.\u201d She and the public school and Oxford-educated Nugee were from wildly different backgrounds, though not all of this comes down to social class. It\u2019s more complicated than that. Thornberry, who was born in Guildford in 1960, is from a solidly middle-class background: her father, later assistant secretary general of the United Nations, was a Cambridge-educated barrister; her mother was a teacher and a Labour councillor. But her early life is imprinted with a dramatic \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d: when she was seven, her father left her mother for another woman and the family\u2019s situation changed radically. Her mother moved into a council house and Thornberry and her siblings had free school meals; early on, they were so broke that \u2013 according to legend \u2013 their cats were put down. \u201cIt was a different time,\u201d she says. \u201cIt [divorce] didn\u2019t happen then.\u201d It wasn\u2019t shameful, exactly. But it was unusual enough for comment and her mother felt it. She would sit up late, telling Emily how terrible her father was. Is is true about the cats? \u201cYes, it is true,\u201d she says. That suggests a catastrophe, doesn\u2019t it, and of a kind that would form a person utterly? \u201cYes,\u201d she says, again. \u201cAnd there was a double whammy. When I was 15, I had a row with my mum, and I went to live with my dad in Hammersmith, and one day, he went to New York and he never came back [he\u2019d had a job offer from the UN]. Suddenly, I was on my own in London. When you\u2019re 17, you live with it, but when I was the mother of a 17-year-old myself, I became furious about it. How irresponsible.\u201d Naturally, she couldn\u2019t go back to her mother. \u201cI couldn\u2019t admit to her what was going on. My pride was at stake.\u201d Was she lonely? \u201cI was terribly lonely.\u201d Did her father feel guilty? \u201cI don\u2019t know. He never told me that he felt guilty.\u201d Their father\u2019s abandonment affected his children in different ways. \u201cHe had six children. I have two full brothers, a half-brother who died and two half-sisters. They all had strong criticisms of him. Dad came back, having been away for decades, with dementia, and had to be looked after. My brother found a care home, but having done that, he said: right, that\u2019s it. I was the one who had to go and see him. I saw him disintegrate. He wasn\u2019t someone who lived on other people\u2019s emotions. He was self-contained and never complained; his wives and girlfriends would tell me what was going on in his life. But it was terrible to see. He would talk about it. He would say he felt he was drowning in the sea, the waves coming over him, that he was disappearing. I had to go and see him and to begin with, I really resented it \u2013 that he had disappeared with so little involvement in our lives and now he expected us to look after him. But as he disintegrated in front of me, I just felt great pity for him and great love for him. I thought: you\u2019re an old bastard, but I do love you. \u201cWhen he died, I was really sad, whereas my brothers turned up at the funeral raging. They still felt the same anger. Some of my siblings, if they were honest, would say they still suffer from the way he treated them. But I am all right. He was a great man, but he was terribly flawed as a father.\u201d The awareness she\u2019d had during his illness that visiting him would save her in the end \u2013 that this was important emotional work \u2013 turned out to be right. \u201cIt helped me. It absolutely helped me. That was the point. My attitude to his death was calm, peaceful, balanced.\u201d Her voice is very low now, but there is no self-pity in it or even much sadness. All this has made her what she is \u2013 it\u2019s a part of her \u2013 and she knows it. Thornberry failed her 11-plus and was bullied at her secondary modern. Her teachers had no hopes for her. But, alone in London, working as a cleaner and a barmaid, she resat her O-levels, took her A-levels and won a place to read law at the University of Kent. After bar school, she joined Michael Mansfield\u2019s chambers. She was the unsuccessful Labour candidate for Canterbury in 2001 and was elected to parliament in 2005, replacing Chris Smith as the MP for Islington South and Finsbury. Thus far, the only real blip she has experienced in terms of her parliamentary career was her sacking as shadow attorney general by Ed Miliband after she tweeted a photograph of a house in Rochester that was decorated with three St George\u2019s flags in 2014, during the byelection there (she never deleted the tweet, which is telling). \u201cI\u2019ve always been driven,\u201d she says. \u201cI always joke that I have a chip on each shoulder \u2013 that it gives me balance \u2013 but actually, being chippy is a good thing. I feel I have a lot to prove. I still remember my careers teacher. I still remember the low expectations.\u201d Her self-confidence is a hard-won thing; in the beginning, I suspect, she performed it, wearing it almost like a fancy dress costume until, at a certain point, it turned into the real deal. She is still, she thinks, on the receiving end of sexism \u2013 \u201cthis is a patriarchal society; things aren\u2019t sorted out yet\u201d \u2013 but she also believes that it\u2019s better to be honest about this stuff. \u201cI hope I can give support to other women, to tell them they can do it and to ask them to do it,\u201d she says. \u201cWomen have to be asked and asked again. Before I stood for shadow cabinet, Harriet Harman chased me down a corridor and shouted at me. That was the only reason I agreed \u2013 because I was embarrassed.\u201d Are there still moments when she suffers from impostor syndrome? \u201cLess than I did. I\u2019m getting over it.\u201d She laughs (she\u2019s always laughing). \u201cI hope all that will be gone completely by the time I\u2019m 60.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 22 July 2019 to update a reference to a news report about the Labour staff, members and supporters\u2019 letter.",

More than 18 months after the military coup that removed Robert Mugabe from power, the new government is struggling to overcome the legacy of the dictator\u2019s 30 years of repressive rule and the consequences of its own failure to undertake meaningful political reform. Official figures published on Monday showed annual inflation had almost doubled to 175% in June, adding to the pressure on a population already struggling with shortages of basic foodstuffs, fuel and medicine. The rising prices reminded many of the economic collapse caused by Mugabe\u2019s policies a decade ago, when hyperinflation emptied shelves of basic foodstuffs and led the southern African country to abandon its currency. Cleopas Murambwi, 34, a day labourer from the capital, Harare, said the economic crisis had turned him into a \u201cpauper\u201d. \u201cJust a year ago my salary could sustain my family. Now we just live each day as it comes \u2026 It\u2019s like we are sliding back to 2008. The signs are clear and it\u2019s not looking good,\u201d said Murambwi.

I hope I can get something to take home to my children. I don\u2019t want them to suffer,\u201d Makazhu said. A severe drought has caused further hardship and rolling power cuts as water levels in dams have dropped. The energy minister, Fortune Chasi, said on Monday that the electricity situation was \u201ca very, very big problem\u201d. The government has repeatedly increased the price of fuel as it tries to end subsidies and is expected to increase electricity prices in coming weeks. Cecilia Alexander, chair of the Apex Council, a grouping of government workers\u2019 unions, said the government\u2019s austerity plans had reduced even those with jobs to poverty. \u201cAs workers, we refuse to be sacrificed. We \u2026 will bring the entire civil service out to protest,\u201d Alexander said. Protests and a strike in January led to an army crackdown which left more than a dozen people dead and hundreds injured. Authorities were forced to resort to mass trials of detained suspects. Analysts say the government is making strenuous efforts to stabilise the economy, running a budget surplus for the first time in years and refraining from printing money, a key cause of the hyperinflation of 2008.

      "body": "<p>A few months ago, as I struggled to carve out time in my crowded days for writing, a colleague suggested I read a book about the daily rituals of great artists. But instead of offering me the inspiration I\u2019d hoped for, what struck me most about these creative geniuses \u2013 mostly men \u2013 was not their schedules and daily routines, but those of the women in their lives.</p> <p>Their wives protected them from interruptions; their housekeepers and maids brought them breakfast and coffee at odd hours; their nannies kept their children out of their hair. Martha Freud not only laid out Sigmund\u2019s clothes every morning, she even put the toothpaste on his toothbrush. Marcel Proust\u2019s housekeeper, Celeste, not only brought him his daily coffee, croissants, newspapers and mail on a silver tray, but was always on hand whenever he wanted to chat, sometimes for hours. Some women are mentioned only for what they put up with, like Karl Marx\u2019s wife \u2013 unnamed in the book \u2013 who lived in squalor with the surviving three of their six children while he spent his days writing at the British Museum.</p> <p>Gustav Mahler married a promising young composer named Alma, then forbade her from composing, saying there could be only one in the family. Instead, she was expected to keep the house utterly silent for him. After his midday swim, he\u2019d whistle for Alma to join him on long, silent walks while he composed in his head. She\u2019d sit for hours on a branch or in the grass, not daring to disturb him. \u201cThere\u2019s such a struggle going on in me!\u201d Alma wrote in her diary. \u201cAnd a miserable longing for someone who thinks OF ME, who helps me to find MYSELF! I\u2019ve sunk to the level of a housekeeper!\u201d</p> <p>Unlike the male artists, who moved through life as if unfettered time to themselves were a birthright, the days and life trajectories of the handful of female artists featured in the book were often limited by the expectations and duties of home and care. George Sand always worked late at night, a practice that started when she was a teenager and needed to take care of her grandmother. Starting out, Francine Prose\u2019s writing day was defined by the departure and return of her children on the school bus. Alice Munro wrote in the \u201cslivers\u201d of time she could find between housekeeping and childrearing. And Maya Angelou got away from the pull of home by leaving it altogether, checking herself into an unadorned hotel room to think, read and write.</p> <p>Even Anthony Trollope, who famously wrote 2,000 words before 8am every morning, most likely learned the habit from his mother, who began writing at age 53 to support her sick husband and their six children. She rose at 4am and finished work in time to serve the family breakfast.</p> <p>I think of all the books, paintings, music, scientific discoveries, philosophy I learned about in school \u2013 almost all by men. The conductor Zubin Mehta once said, \u201cI just don\u2019t think women should be in an orchestra,\u201d as if they didn\u2019t have the temperament, or the talent. (Blind auditions put an end to that notion.) I think of an interview Patti Scialfa gave on how difficult it was for her to write the music for her solo album because her kids kept interrupting her and demanding her time in a way that they never would of their father, Bruce Springsteen. And it strikes me: it\u2019s not that women haven\u2019t had the talent to make their mark in the world of ideas and art. They\u2019ve never had the time.</p> <p>Women\u2019s time has been interrupted and fragmented throughout history, the rhythms of their days circumscribed by the sisyphean tasks of housework, childcare and kin work \u2013 keeping family and community ties strong. If what it takes to create are long stretches of uninterrupted, concentrated time, time you can choose to do with as you will, time that you can control, that\u2019s something women have never had the luxury to expect, at least not without getting slammed for unseemly selfishness.</p> <p>Even today, around the globe, with so many women in the paid labor force, women still spend at least twice as much time as men doing housework and childcare, sometimes much more. One study of 32 families in Los Angeles found that the uninterrupted leisure time of most mothers lasted, on average, no more than 10 minutes at a stretch. And in mapping the daily lives of academics, the sociologist Joya Misra and her colleagues found that the work days of the female professors were much longer than their male colleagues, once you factored in all their unpaid labor at home. Even so, she found that the men and women she studied spent about the same amount of time at their paid work. But the women\u2019s time at work, too, was interrupted and fragmented, chopped up with more <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/01/10/study-finds-female-professors-experience-more-work-demands-and-special-favor\">service work</a>, mentoring and teaching. The men spent more of their work days in long stretches of uninterrupted time to think, research, write, create and publish to make their names, advance their careers and get their ideas out into the world.</p> <p>In his Theory of the Leisure Class, Thorstein Veblen wrote that throughout history the people who had the ability to choose and control their time were high-status men. He dismissed women on page two, writing that they, along with the servants and the slaves, have always been responsible for the drudge work that enables those high-status men to think their great thoughts. Feminist researchers have argued that women have often had, at most, \u201cinvisible leisure\u201d \u2013 enjoyable, but productive and socially sanctioned, activities like quilting bees, canning parties or book groups. Yet <em>pure</em> leisure, making time just for oneself, is nothing short of a courageous act of radical and subversive resistance. Easier to do, one researcher joked, if, like the writer, composer, philosopher and mystic Hildegard of Bingen, you became a nun.</p> <p>Feminist researchers have also found that many women don\u2019t feel that they <em>deserve</em> long stretches of time to themselves, the way men do. They feel they have to earn it. And the only way to do that is to get to the end of a To Do list that never ends: the chores of the day, as Melinda Gates writes in her new book, killing the dreams of a lifetime. Indeed, I\u2019ve been trying to carve out time to think and write this essay for more than four months. Every single time I\u2019ve sat down to start, I\u2019ve gotten a panicked call or email from my husband, son or daughter; my mother, dealing with the strange frontier and endless paperwork of the newly widowed; a credit card company; or a mechanic about some emergency or other that requires my immediate attention to stave off certain disaster.</p> <p>I remember interviewing psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, famed for identifying the state of <em>flow</em>, the peak human experience when one is so absorbed in a meaningful task that time effectively disappears. It\u2019s the state that artists and thinkers say is a requirement for creating anything of value. I asked him if his research explored whether women had as much opportunity to get into flow as men. He thought for a moment, then told me a story of a woman who lost track of time as she ironed her husband\u2019s shirts.</p> <p>The poet Eleanor Ross Taylor <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/eleanor-ross-taylor-poet-of-womens-lives-in-the-south-dies-at-91/2012/01/10/gIQALoIdpP_story.html?utm_term=.71fc52180cd7\">lived</a> her life in the shadow of her husband, the Pulitzer prize-winning novelist, short story writer and professor Peter Taylor. \u201cOver the years, many times I would say to poems, \u2018Go away, I don\u2019t have time now,\u2019\u201d she told an interviewer in 1997. \u201cBut that was part laziness. If you really want to write, you can. I did keep the house scrubbed and waxed and that sort of thing.\u201d</p> <p>I feel such a sense of loss when I think of the great, unwritten poems that took a backseat to polished floors. And for a long time, I thought the expectation that others be tended to first and the floors be polished and that she was the one who was supposed to keep them that way was what kept those untold stories coiled inside her, compressed, as Maya Angelou writes, to the point of pain. But I wonder if it isn\u2019t also that women feel they don\u2019t deserve time to themselves, or enough of it that comes in unbroken stretches. I wonder if we also feel we don\u2019t deserve to tell our untold stories, that they may not be as worth listening to.</p> <p>The writer VS Naipaul claimed that no woman writer was his match, that women\u2019s writing is too \u201csentimental\u201d, their worldview too \u201cnarrow\u201d \u2013 because, you know, men\u2019s lives are the default for the human experience. And I\u2019ve often wondered: would a woman who\u2019d written a carefully observed six-volume novel based on her own life have received the same attention and international acclaim as the Norwegian writer Karl Ove Knausgaard, author of My Struggle?</p> <p>Virginia Woolf once imagined what would have become of Shakespeare were he born a woman, or if he\u2019d had an equally gifted sister. (Think of the musical prodigy Nannerl Mozart, whose early compositions her brother Wolfgang praised as \u201cbeautiful\u201d but have been lost, or remained coiled inside, unwritten, as she disappeared into an expected but loveless marriage.)</p> <p>The female Shakespeare, Woolf wrote, would never have had the time or the ability to develop her genius \u2013 barred from school, told to mind the stew, expected to marry young, and beaten if she didn\u2019t. In Woolf\u2019s telling, Shakespeare\u2019s sister, despite her great gifts, wound up crazy, dead, or shut up in a cottage in the woods and mocked as a witch.</p> <p>But that wasn\u2019t the end of the story. Woolf imagined that, in the future, a woman with genius would be born. Her ability to blossom \u2013 and the expectation that her voice, her vision, was worthy \u2013 would depend entirely on the world we decided to create. \u201cShe would come if we worked for her,\u201d Woolf wrote.</p> <p>I do not claim to have any particular genius. But sometimes, I dream that I\u2019m sitting in a dusky room at a kitchen table across from another version of me, who sits, unbound by time, quietly drinking a cup of tea. \u201cI wish you\u2019d visit more often,\u201d she tells me. And I wonder if that searing middle-of-the-night pain that, at times, settles like dread around my solar plexus may not only be because there\u2019s so little unbroken time to tell my own untold stories, but because I\u2019m afraid that what may be coiled inside may not be worth paying attention to anyway. Perhaps that\u2019s what I don\u2019t want to face in that dusky room I dream of.</p> <p>I also wonder: what if we really did do the work to create a world where the sisters of Shakespeare and Mozart, or any woman, really, could thrive? What would happen if we decided women deserved the time to go to their dusky rooms and stay awhile at the kitchen table? What if we all decided to visit more often, drinking a quiet cup of tea with ourselves, listening to the coil of stories as they unspool, knowing they have value simply because they\u2019re true? I\u2019d love to see what happens next.</p> <ul> <li><p>Brigid Schulte is a Pulitzer prize-winning journalist for The Washington Post and The Washington Post Magazine.

      "body": "<p>What is a children\u2019s film? Is it a film aimed specifically at younger viewers, tailor-made to cater to their growing needs? Maybe it\u2019s a film <em>about</em> childhood, a coming-of-age story that resonates with a wide range of viewers, young and old alike. Or perhaps it\u2019s simply any film that a child <em>could</em> watch, anything that isn\u2019t restricted by its nature to adult-only audiences.</p> <p>When I was a kid in the late 60s and early 70s, there were two movie classifications that excluded younger viewers: <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/592554/index.html\" title=\"\">the </a><a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/592554/index.html\" title=\"\">AA</a><a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/592554/index.html\" title=\"\"> category</a>, introduced in 1970, for which you had to be at least 14 years old; and <a href=\"http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/591679/index.html\" title=\"\">X-certificate movies</a>, which were restricted to over-16s or (after 1970) over-18s. Films that fell under these prohibitive categories included everything from the David Essex/Ringo Starr Brit-pop romp <em>That\u2019ll Be the Day</em> to the violent Sam Peckinpah shocker <em>Straw Dogs</em> via such innocuous fare as <em>Blazing Saddles</em>, <em>American Graffiti</em> and <em>Conquest of the Planet of the Apes</em>. All of these were out of bounds in my preteen years. Yet there were plenty more strange and wonderful films that fell into the U or A certificate categories, making them available to anyone (or at least anyone over the age of five), sometimes under adult supervision, more often not\u2026</p> <p>From as far back as I can remember, I spent as much time in the cinema as possible, seeing anything and everything that I was allowed to watch \u2013 with occasionally traumatic results. I remember one Saturday morning in 1970, when I was eight years old. My mother dropped my brother and me at the local Odeon while she went and did the weekly shopping. She knew the film showing that morning would be suitable for us because it had a U certificate, <a href=\"https://bbfc.co.uk/case-studies/kes\" title=\"\">meaning \u201c</a><a href=\"https://bbfc.co.uk/case-studies/kes\" title=\"\">universal\u201d \u2013 fit for all</a>!</p> <p>Two hours later, she picked us up outside the cinema in floods of tears. The film we\u2019d been watching was Ken Loach\u2019s <em>Kes</em> \u2013 a milestone of British cinema that didn\u2019t shy away from depicting the grim realities of its central character\u2019s hard-knocks life, including beatings, taunting, naked humiliation, and (in the final reel) horrible animal death.</p> <p>Despite my distress, I have never once regretted seeing <em>Kes</em> at such a young age (it has since been reclassified PG, meaning that parents should take care). Other movies that I saw around the same age included Stanley Kubrick\u2019s <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>, Andrei Tarkovsky\u2019s <em>Solaris</em>, Arthur Hiller\u2019s <em>Plaza Suite</em>, Jean-Luc Godard\u2019s <em>Alphaville</em>, Franklin J Schaffner\u2019s <em>Patton</em> (Elvis\u2019s favourite film!), Jess Franco\u2019s <em>The Castle of Fu Manchu</em> and a string of catastrophe-filled 70s disaster movies from <em>Airport</em> to <em>The Towering Inferno</em>. None of these would generally be considered \u201cchildren\u2019s movies\u201d, but I saw them all as a child, and they were all part of my cinematic education, for better or worse.</p> <p>In compiling this list of 25 great movies for children, I have attempted to bear in mind the vast range of films that I was lucky enough to have encountered at an impressionable age, and to acknowledge that, until fairly recently, young moviegoers were raised on a diet of movies that played to audiences of <em>all</em> ages. To this end, I\u2019ve used the current guidelines of the British Board of Film Classification (still the most reliable and accountable regulatory body in the world) as a yardstick, accepting for inclusion any film that they currently rate U, PG or 12/12A \u2013 the classifications of movies which can legitimately be watched by audiences under the age of 15.</p> <p>My choices range from short animations to feature-length live-action films, from silent films to foreign-language classics (I\u2019m assuming subtitles aren\u2019t an issue) from a century of international cinema. Along with the more obvious contenders, I\u2019ve included a few titles that some readers may not consider to be children\u2019s films at all. Fair enough. But, crucially, these are all films that kids <em>could</em> watch, if they wanted. The list is arranged not by merit but by date, and I\u2019ve included the most recent BBFC certificates for reference. Take a look, and then let me know your own choices.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Tell us about your favourite children\u2019s films in the comments below or tweet us at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ObsNewReview\">@ObsNewReview</a></em></p> <p>\u2022 <em>Unless otherwise indicated, the films listed can be found to rent or buy on one or more of the usual online streaming services</em></p> <h2>1. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBX2Yy2dqg4\" title=\"\">The Kid </a><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBX2Yy2dqg4\" title=\"\">(1921, U)</a></em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1a0993df9974cb35b7c516d61f4f8cbabeacdfe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1a0993df9974cb35b7c516d61f4f8cbabeacdfe/0_104_2775_1666/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charlie Chaplin and Jackie Coogan in The Kid\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlie Chaplin and Jackie Coogan in The Kid.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Charles Chaplin Productions/Sportsphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jackie Coogan stars as Charlie Chaplin\u2019s sidekick/adopted waif in this timeless classic, widely regarded as one of the finest films of the silent era.

      "bodyText": "What is a children\u2019s film? Is it a film aimed specifically at younger viewers, tailor-made to cater to their growing needs? Maybe it\u2019s a film about childhood, a coming-of-age story that resonates with a wide range of viewers, young and old alike. Or perhaps it\u2019s simply any film that a child could watch, anything that isn\u2019t restricted by its nature to adult-only audiences. When I was a kid in the late 60s and early 70s, there were two movie classifications that excluded younger viewers: the AA category, introduced in 1970, for which you had to be at least 14 years old; and X-certificate movies, which were restricted to over-16s or (after 1970) over-18s. Films that fell under these prohibitive categories included everything from the David Essex/Ringo Starr Brit-pop romp That\u2019ll Be the Day to the violent Sam Peckinpah shocker Straw Dogs via such innocuous fare as Blazing Saddles, American Graffiti and Conquest of the Planet of the Apes. All of these were out of bounds in my preteen years. Yet there were plenty more strange and wonderful films that fell into the U or A certificate categories, making them available to anyone (or at least anyone over the age of five), sometimes under adult supervision, more often not\u2026 From as far back as I can remember, I spent as much time in the cinema as possible, seeing anything and everything that I was allowed to watch \u2013 with occasionally traumatic results. I remember one Saturday morning in 1970, when I was eight years old. My mother dropped my brother and me at the local Odeon while she went and did the weekly shopping. She knew the film showing that morning would be suitable for us because it had a U certificate, meaning \u201cuniversal\u201d \u2013 fit for all! Two hours later, she picked us up outside the cinema in floods of tears. The film we\u2019d been watching was Ken Loach\u2019s Kes \u2013 a milestone of British cinema that didn\u2019t shy away from depicting the grim realities of its central character\u2019s hard-knocks life, including beatings, taunting, naked humiliation, and (in the final reel) horrible animal death. Despite my distress, I have never once regretted seeing Kes at such a young age (it has since been reclassified PG, meaning that parents should take care). Other movies that I saw around the same age included Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 2001: A Space Odyssey, Andrei Tarkovsky\u2019s Solaris, Arthur Hiller\u2019s Plaza Suite, Jean-Luc Godard\u2019s Alphaville, Franklin J Schaffner\u2019s Patton (Elvis\u2019s favourite film!), Jess Franco\u2019s The Castle of Fu Manchu and a string of catastrophe-filled 70s disaster movies from Airport to The Towering Inferno. None of these would generally be considered \u201cchildren\u2019s movies\u201d, but I saw them all as a child, and they were all part of my cinematic education, for better or worse. In compiling this list of 25 great movies for children, I have attempted to bear in mind the vast range of films that I was lucky enough to have encountered at an impressionable age, and to acknowledge that, until fairly recently, young moviegoers were raised on a diet of movies that played to audiences of all ages. To this end, I\u2019ve used the current guidelines of the British Board of Film Classification (still the most reliable and accountable regulatory body in the world) as a yardstick, accepting for inclusion any film that they currently rate U, PG or 12/12A \u2013 the classifications of movies which can legitimately be watched by audiences under the age of 15. My choices range from short animations to feature-length live-action films, from silent films to foreign-language classics (I\u2019m assuming subtitles aren\u2019t an issue) from a century of international cinema. Along with the more obvious contenders, I\u2019ve included a few titles that some readers may not consider to be children\u2019s films at all. Fair enough. But, crucially, these are all films that kids could watch, if they wanted. The list is arranged not by merit but by date, and I\u2019ve included the most recent BBFC certificates for reference. Take a look, and then let me know your own choices. \u2022 Tell us about your favourite children\u2019s films in the comments below or tweet us at @ObsNewReview \u2022 Unless otherwise indicated, the films listed can be found to rent or buy on one or more of the usual online streaming services 1. The Kid (1921, U) Jackie Coogan stars as Charlie Chaplin\u2019s sidekick/adopted waif in this timeless classic, widely regarded as one of the finest films of the silent era. In his first feature-length feature as director, Chaplin conjures \u201ca picture with a smile \u2013 and perhaps a tear\u201d, perfecting the blend of humour, pathos and tragedy that would make him a beloved icon around the world. No child or adult could watch this and remain unmoved. 2. The Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926, PG) Lotte Reiniger\u2019s 1926 German production is one of the oldest surviving animated features, and suffers from the kind of racial and gender stereotyping that beset so many films of this period. But for audiences mature enough to see beyond the outmoded politics, it offers a fascinating insight into the history of animation. Taking inspiration from One Thousand and One Nights, Reiniger\u2019s film has influenced countless children\u2019s classics, from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to The Sword in the Stone and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. 3. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937, U) Disney\u2019s first feature-length animation played to packed houses of all ages when first released. An astonishing technical achievement, it benefited from eye-popping artwork, spine-tingling music, and an occasionally horrifying narrative (the BBFC originally rated it A, and it only got an uncut U in 1987). This note of brooding darkness would continue throughout all the finest Disney films, connecting them to the great traditions of the Brothers Grimm, and proving that children appreciate a touch of fear with their fun. 4. The Wizard of Oz (1939, U) Flying monkeys, terrifying twisters and melting witches \u2013 they\u2019re all here in MGM\u2019s brilliant adaptation of L Frank Baum\u2019s fantastical source material. Shirley Temple was originally considered for the lead role of Dorothy, a part Judy Garland made her own. Despite winning an Oscar for best song, Arlen and Harburg\u2019s Over the Rainbow nearly hit the cutting room floor after studio execs worried that the sepia-toned Kansas scenes were too long, and younger kids wouldn\u2019t understand the complex emotions of the lyrics. 5. Pather Panchali (1955, U) Satyajit Ray\u2019s directorial debut won the best human document award at the 1956 Cannes film festival, and became a key text in the evolution of modern Indian cinema. Adapted from the novel by Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay, Ray\u2019s film portrays the struggles and smiles of impoverished village life with clarity and compassion, aided by a wonderfully natural performance from young Subir Banerjee. The film was followed by Aparajito and Apur Sansar, which together form the acclaimed Apu trilogy. 6. The Red Balloon (1956, U) Albert Lamorisse\u2019s short French film follows the adventures of a young boy who finds a balloon that seems to have a mind of its own. A beacon of hope amid a darkened landscape, it\u2019s an endlessly intriguing and inspiring slice of poetic postwar cinema. Lamorisse won an Oscar for best screenplay, becoming the only person ever to triumph in this category with a short film. 7. The 400 Blows (1959, PG) Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud is the restless spirit who comes of age in Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut\u2019s nouvelle vague masterpiece. The French title, Les Quatre Cents Coups, refers to an expression meaning \u201cto raise hell\u201d, capturing the rebellious nature of Antoine Doinel, an alter ego character drawn in part from Truffaut\u2019s own youthful experiences. L\u00e9aud would play Antoine in a succession of subsequent movies spanning two decades. 8. Mary Poppins (1964, U) Adapted from the books of PL Travers (who was famously sceptical about the film), Robert Stevenson\u2019s sublime Disney musical is, in my opinion, one of the 10 greatest movies ever made. Garnering a whopping 13 Oscar nominations, the film scored several wins, including best actress for Julie Andrews and best song for the Sherman brothers\u2019 composition Chim Chim Cher-ee. But it\u2019s the heartbreaking majesty of Feed the Birds that underpins the film\u2019s most extraordinary sequence \u2013 musically, technically, and emotionally. 9. Kes (1969, PG) Barry Hines\u2019s novel A Kestrel for a Knave is brought to the screen with astonishing verisimilitude by Ken Loach in this masterpiece of British social-realist cinema. David \u201cDai\u201d Bradley is the young Billy Caspar whose dreams take flight when he trains and tends to a bird that becomes his closest companion. Despite an unforgivingly downbeat ending, Kes remains essential viewing for anyone who believes in the transcendent power of honest art. 10. Dougal and the Blue Cat (1970/72, U) Originally released in France as Pollux et le Chat Bleu, this feature-length spinoff from The Magic Roundabout arrived in the UK with the voices of Eric Thompson and Fenella Fielding. Together they transform Serge Danot\u2019s peculiar stop-motion animation into a brilliantly bizarre and eerily haunting oddity that continues to attract new generations of fans. No wonder Black Mirror creator Charlie Brooker chose Florence\u2019s Sad Song (a track from the movie) as one of his selections on Desert Island Discs. Only on DVD (Second Sight Films) 11. The Amazing Mr Blunden (1972, U) Writer-director Lionel Jeffries works pure screen wonder with Antonia Barber\u2019s novel The Ghosts. When a family become housekeepers of a derelict mansion, time-travelling magic forges friendships across the ages. While Jeffries may be more celebrated for directing The Railway Children (one of the most enduring British children\u2019s movies), this is his true masterpiece. 12. The Street (1976, PG) Produced by the National Film Board of Canada, Caroline Leaf\u2019s Oscar-nominated short \u2013 a mere 10 minutes in length \u2013 uses paint on glass animation to bring Mordecai Richler\u2019s story (which addresses the taboo subject of death) to life with empathy and wit. In a 2003 interview, Leaf said that the key to her adaptation was \u201cto drop as much of the text as possible, putting the storytelling into the images\u201d. Free at nfb.ca/film/the_street 13. ET: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982, U) This tearjerking tale of a young boy\u2019s friendship with a stranded space alien may technically be a sci-fi movie, but it also represents a very personal account of director Steven Spielberg\u2019s down-to-earth feelings of childhood isolation and anxiety following his parents\u2019 divorce. A wonderful script by Melissa Mathison and a surging score by John Williams help this to pack a mighty emotional punch. 14. My Neighbour Totoro (1988, U) It\u2019s hard to decide which of Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s matchless animations to include in this list (Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, Howl\u2019s Moving Castle and Ponyo are all classics) but this 1988 Studio Ghibli offering about young children befriending forest spirits retains a special place in many viewers\u2019 hearts. As with all of the Ghibli films, My Neighbour Totoro boasts the pan-generational appeal that has made Miyazaki\u2019s works so popular. Only on DVD (StudioCanal) 15. The Secret Garden (1993, U) Frances Hodgson Burnett\u2019s book has inspired several movies, from a 1919 production starring Lila Lee to a forthcoming version written by Harry Potter and the Cursed Child playwright Jack Thorne. But Agnieszka Holland\u2019s 1993 adaptation, which earned a supporting actress Bafta nomination for Maggie Smith, is a particular delight, hailed by Roger Ebert as \u201ca work of beauty, poetry and deep mystery\u2026 like entering for a time into a closed world where one\u2019s destiny may be discovered\u201d. 16. Little Women (1994, U) Gillian Armstrong\u2019s hugely likable adaptation of Louisa May Alcott\u2019s novel about the lives of the four March sisters earned Oscar nominations for Thomas Newman\u2019s score, Colleen Atwood\u2019s costumes, and Winona Ryder\u2019s starring role as Jo March. First brought to the screen in the silent era, the novel has inspired films by such luminaries as George Cukor and Mervyn LeRoy, with a new version written and directed by Greta Gerwig due to open in the UK in the new year. 17. Kirikou and the Sorceress (1998, U) Youssou N\u2019Dour provides the music for Michel Ocelot\u2019s international co-production, an animated fable, inspired by a west African folk tale, about a young boy who takes on a sorceress terrorising his village. The BBFC, who rated the film U, note correctly that it contains \u201cmild violence, peril and natural nudity\u201d \u2013 the last of which reportedly caused problems in some territories. Only on DVD (BFI) 18. Whale Rider (2002, PG) Keisha Castle-Hughes shines in Niki Caro\u2019s breakout New Zealand hit, based on the novel of the same name by M\u0101ori writer Witi Ihimaera. A young girl fights for the right to become the leader of her tribe \u2013 a role traditionally reserved for men. Castle-Hughes earned a best actress Oscar nomination, making her at the time the youngest ever nominee in that category (a record later broken by Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis for her performance in Beasts of the Southern Wild). 19. Bend It Like Beckham (2002, 12) It\u2019s arguable that Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging, Gurinder Chadha\u2019s 2008 adaptation of Louise Rennison\u2019s teen novels, better suits the \u201cchildren\u2019s film\u201d remit of this list. But her 2002 classic about the friendship between two young women (winningly played by Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley) who bond on the football pitch seems even more pertinent today than it did when the film first came out. A hit with audiences and critics alike, Bend It Like Beckham spawned a stage musical and continues to inspire new viewers. 20. The Cave of the Yellow Dog (2005, U) Byambasuren Davaa, co-director of The Story of the Weeping Camel, returns to her Mongolian homeland for this blend of fact and fiction, centring on a family of hard-working nomads whose work-life cycles are defined by the rhythm of the seasons. Whether making cheese, dismantling their yurt or playing with dried dung (a highlight for the kids!) the Batchuluuns remind us that, trite as it may sound, life\u2019s true joys lie in the simple things. A lovely movie with the power to engross, educate and entertain. 21. Like Stars on Earth (2007, PG) Originally entitled Taare Zameen Par, this hugely popular Indian drama, produced and directed by Aamir Khan, follows young Ishaan (Darsheel Safary) as he faces up to educational challenges. India\u2019s submission for the 2009 foreign language film Oscar, Like Stars on Earth was picked up by Disney on DVD, bringing it to the attention of a worldwide audience. 22. Wadjda (2012, PG) Waad Mohammed is terrific as the titular Saudi girl who enters a Koran recitation competition in the hope of raising the funds she needs to buy herself a coveted bicycle. Written and directed by Saudi Arabian film-maker Haifaa al-Mansour, this Bafta-nominated treat is a little miracle \u2013 a film that challenges rules and stereotypes with a lightness of touch that makes it accessible to all. 23. Queen of Katwe (2016, PG) Inspired by the true-life story of Phiona Mutesi, this uplifting film follows a young woman living in the slums of Uganda whose life is changed by her talent for chess. Madina Nalwanga, David Oyelowo and Lupita Nyong\u2019o head up a very engaging ensemble cast with whom director Mira Nair works wonders (fun fact: Moonlight helmer Barry Jenkins was at one point in the running to direct). 24. The Red Turtle (2016, PG) UK-based Dutch animator Micha\u00ebl Dudok de Wit directs this Japanese-French-Belgian co-production \u2013 a first for Studio Ghibli. A poignant, wordless tale of a man shipwrecked on a desert island, it boasts a sublime simplicity that unifies its complex elements into a singular, universal voice. Eloquent, profound and moving, The Red Turtle benefits from a wonderful score by Laurent Perez del Mar that says more than words ever could. 25. The Breadwinner (2017, 12A) Adapted from Deborah Ellis\u2019s much-loved YA book, Nora Twomey\u2019s beautifully animated tale of youthful fortitude in Taliban-era Afghanistan has something of the defiant feminist spirit of the French-Iranian gem Persepolis. When her father is imprisoned, young Parvana is forced to don\u2019s men\u2019s clothes in order to provide for her family. A brilliant Irish-Canadian-Luxembourgish co-production from Kilkenny\u2019s Cartoon Saloon, the geniuses behind The Secret of Kells and Song of the Sea.",

The first three pieces \u2013 Pi\u00e8ce h\u00e9ro\u00efque, Pr\u00e9lude, Fugue et Variation Op 18 and Cantabile \u2013 date from almost the period the Salisbury instrument was built. Franck, himself an organist, achieved his majestic, Bach-inspired best in the Trois Chorals pour Grande Orgue, written shortly before his death. Ideally you need to listen in a large room with the volume turned up.</p> <p>\u2022 There\u2019s not much around for organ enthusiasts, incipient or fully paid-up fans, but listen out on the first Sunday of the month, when <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006tnw5\" title=\"\">Choir and Organ</a></strong> on Radio 3 is devoted to the organ.

A striking debut. \u2022 Organist John Challenger, assistant director of music at Salisbury Cathedral, is a youthful keyboard virtuoso of a different variety. Having already released a disc of Elgar, this latest is devoted to C\u00e9sar Franck, played on Salisbury\u2019s magnificent 1877 \u201cFather\u201d Henry Willis organ, and released on the cathedral\u2019s own label. Renovations and modernisations aside, the instrument retains its original tonal colours, but one aim of this excellent disc is to raise funds for essential restoration. The booklet notes, quaintly, that \u201csome wind leakage and action noise may be audible at times\u201d, but you\u2019d have to strain to notice. Challenger displays technical wizardry and infinite sonic variety throughout. The first three pieces \u2013 Pi\u00e8ce h\u00e9ro\u00efque, Pr\u00e9lude, Fugue et Variation Op 18 and Cantabile \u2013 date from almost the period the Salisbury instrument was built. Franck, himself an organist, achieved his majestic, Bach-inspired best in the Trois Chorals pour Grande Orgue, written shortly before his death. Ideally you need to listen in a large room with the volume turned up. \u2022 There\u2019s not much around for organ enthusiasts, incipient or fully paid-up fans, but listen out on the first Sunday of the month, when Choir and Organ on Radio 3 is devoted to the organ. Presenter Sara Mohr-Pietsch\u2019s capacious musical appetite ensures a wide range of styles, aimed at any listener, not just those who want to talk pistons, stops and swells.",

She said that \u201csplashing in the sea for the first time, a moment of wonder in a museum, reaching the summit of a mountain or sleeping under canvas away from home for the night\u201d were all potentially \u201ctransformational\u201d for children.</p> <p>\u201cIt is undeniable that educational visits help children reach their potential, boost social mobility, develop confidence and resilience, and improve personal, social and emotional development,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The government has put more emphasis on learning outside the classroom, launching a new \u201cactivity passport\u201d for primary school children to encourage schools to take them out locally. Somerville said education secretary Damian Hinds\u2019s character and resilience initiative was also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/31/schoolchildren-resilience-education-secretary-pupils\" title=\"\">a positive step</a>.</p> <p>Some attractions have reported an increase in school visits. Historic Royal Palaces, which looks after six palaces including the Tower of London and Hampton Court, said it had seen an increase of just over 5% on last year, after it set up a schools access fund to help some London schools visit for free.</p> <p>The Southbank Centre also said its visits were up by nearly 30%, the rise mostly from primary school visits, after it had doubled the size of its school visits team.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 24 July 2019 to correct a figure supplied in error by the Sutton Trust.

Schools are also mindful that many parents do not have deep pockets either, so the costs of trips can be a problem for families just as much as the schools themselves. \u201cThe fact that schools are sometimes cutting back on opportunities for children should be ringing serious alarm bells for the government.\u201d School visits, and particularly residential trips where children spend time away, can give a significant boost to children from less privileged backgrounds, according to Kim Somerville, chief executive of the Council for Learning Outside the Classroom. She said that \u201csplashing in the sea for the first time, a moment of wonder in a museum, reaching the summit of a mountain or sleeping under canvas away from home for the night\u201d were all potentially \u201ctransformational\u201d for children. \u201cIt is undeniable that educational visits help children reach their potential, boost social mobility, develop confidence and resilience, and improve personal, social and emotional development,\u201d she said. The government has put more emphasis on learning outside the classroom, launching a new \u201cactivity passport\u201d for primary school children to encourage schools to take them out locally. Somerville said education secretary Damian Hinds\u2019s character and resilience initiative was also a positive step. Some attractions have reported an increase in school visits. Historic Royal Palaces, which looks after six palaces including the Tower of London and Hampton Court, said it had seen an increase of just over 5% on last year, after it set up a schools access fund to help some London schools visit for free. The Southbank Centre also said its visits were up by nearly 30%, the rise mostly from primary school visits, after it had doubled the size of its school visits team. \u2022 This article was amended on 24 July 2019 to correct a figure supplied in error by the Sutton Trust. In 2017, the percentage of teachers surveyed who reported that they had cut back on school trips and outings was 31% not 15%.",

He\u2019s 46, so I really should have caught up with him by now, but I missed his show at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jul/23/trajal-harrell-hoochie-koochie-barbican-observer-review\" title=\"\">Barbican in 2017</a>, though I had only heard entirely positive things about his breakthrough piece <em><a href=\"https://thekitchen.org/event/trajal-harrell-twenty-looks-or-paris-is-burning-at-the-judson-church\" title=\"\">Twenty Looks Or Paris </a></em><em><a href=\"https://thekitchen.org/event/trajal-harrell-twenty-looks-or-paris-is-burning-at-the-judson-church\" title=\"\">Is Burning</a></em><a href=\"https://thekitchen.org/event/trajal-harrell-twenty-looks-or-paris-is-burning-at-the-judson-church\" title=\"\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://thekitchen.org/event/trajal-harrell-twenty-looks-or-paris-is-burning-at-the-judson-church\" title=\"\">at the Judson Church</a></em>, which effected an unlikely collision between Harlem voguing and the experimental dance movement of the early 1960s.</p> <p>His own style combines voguing and pop culture, with the theoretical ways of postmodern contemporary dance. That makes it sound awful, but it is utterly transfixing and entirely original. In <em>Maggie the Cat</em> he takes Tennessee Williams\u2019s <em>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</em> \u2013 specifically the film version starring Elizabeth Taylor as Maggie \u2013 and shifts the focus on to the black servants of the house, who are always marginal to the action.</p> <p>Resplendent in a floaty housecoat, Harrell introduces himself as Big Mama, and he and Big Daddy (Perle Palombe in a shirt and shorts) stay at the front of the stage throughout, rapping and dancing, turning the name of Maggie into a kind of incantation over the top of a richly mixed score containing everything from Alberto Iglesias to Bruce Springsteen. Behind them, initially, are tables loaded with red cushions, bed sheets, duvets, towels, aprons and various bright garments.</p> <p>\u201cThis is our help,\u201d he says, as the dancers first clear the jumble sale of goods away and then, magically, begin to reappear, using the household items to clothe themselves in brilliant, seductive, eye-catching ways.

      "bodyText": "Sometimes you see a dance work you don\u2019t know much about, yet recognise \u2013 the moment it begins \u2013 that you are going to follow that choreographer to the ends of the earth from now on. I felt that way about Maggie the Cat, by Trajal Harrell, an experimental American dance-maker, who has been creating ripples for some time. He\u2019s 46, so I really should have caught up with him by now, but I missed his show at the Barbican in 2017, though I had only heard entirely positive things about his breakthrough piece Twenty Looks Or Paris Is Burning at the Judson Church, which effected an unlikely collision between Harlem voguing and the experimental dance movement of the early 1960s. His own style combines voguing and pop culture, with the theoretical ways of postmodern contemporary dance. That makes it sound awful, but it is utterly transfixing and entirely original. In Maggie the Cat he takes Tennessee Williams\u2019s Cat on a Hot Tin Roof \u2013 specifically the film version starring Elizabeth Taylor as Maggie \u2013 and shifts the focus on to the black servants of the house, who are always marginal to the action. Resplendent in a floaty housecoat, Harrell introduces himself as Big Mama, and he and Big Daddy (Perle Palombe in a shirt and shorts) stay at the front of the stage throughout, rapping and dancing, turning the name of Maggie into a kind of incantation over the top of a richly mixed score containing everything from Alberto Iglesias to Bruce Springsteen. Behind them, initially, are tables loaded with red cushions, bed sheets, duvets, towels, aprons and various bright garments. \u201cThis is our help,\u201d he says, as the dancers first clear the jumble sale of goods away and then, magically, begin to reappear, using the household items to clothe themselves in brilliant, seductive, eye-catching ways. A cushion as a handbag. A towel as a hat. They strut and preen as if on a catwalk, their feet arched in a beautiful simulacrum of high heels, appearing over and over again in different forms and moods \u2013 flirtatious, defiant, wild.

Kirsty Asher*, a senior nurse who works with Hayes, found a demand for \u00a345 on her car after parking in the hospital where she is based.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a bank holiday and the whole site was empty,\u201d she says. \u201cYou are supposed to have a permit, but the website kept crashing and as that was my last day in the job I displayed my professional carer\u2019s badge instead.

The medics claimed they had to use visitor car parks because Cardiff and Vale Hospital Trust issues more than 8,500 staff parking permits, but only provides around 1,800 spaces.</p> <p>The case was brought by the enforcement agency against three staff members who had over 100 charge notices outstanding between them, but it was binding on 72 others who had also been ticketed, despite displaying paid-for staff permits.</p> <p>Sue Prior, a local campaigner who helped the nurses prepare their case, told the <em>Observer </em>that some NHS workers were considering leaving the profession because of the parking issues. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily an option to get public transport, if it exists, when they\u2019re on an early or night shift, and since shifts often overrun, staff in some hospitals are being charged for overstaying the maximum hours permitted,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cSome nurses never park in visitor bays because they don\u2019t want to deprive patients of visits, so they leave their car on verges and get charged.

However, NHS staff in England paid nearly \u00a370m to park at hospitals in 2017-18, according to data from NHS Digital, while patients and visitors were charged almost \u00a3157m.

From across the strait, the mountainous silhouette of Albania came and went tantalisingly in a halo of cloud, so when the hydrofoil finally chugged into the port of Saranda, it was a shock to find a jungle of haphazard high-rises hugging the shore. This kick-off to the \u201cAlbanian Riviera\u201d was not for us, however, as my partner and I had plotted our road trip deep into the rugged interior of the south, in search of Byzantine jewels, quaint Ottoman-era guesthouses, mosques, castles and restaurants dishing up delectable local produce.</p> \n<p>\u201cAlbania only has one road \u2013 it goes all the way to Kosovo.

No doubt it was, as we had just left a nature reserve where a panel on local fauna portrayed an identical Canis lupus. Nor was it to be the only unexpected experience in the land of Zog (Albania\u2019s only king, in the 1920s and 30s) which, under the repressive dictator Enver Hoxha, was hermetically sealed apart from the rest of Europe until the 1990s. We had decided to start our journey in Corfu, to avoid the chaos and expense of the capital, Tirana. From across the strait, the mountainous silhouette of Albania came and went tantalisingly in a halo of cloud, so when the hydrofoil finally chugged into the port of Saranda, it was a shock to find a jungle of haphazard high-rises hugging the shore. This kick-off to the \u201cAlbanian Riviera\u201d was not for us, however, as my partner and I had plotted our road trip deep into the rugged interior of the south, in search of Byzantine jewels, quaint Ottoman-era guesthouses, mosques, castles and restaurants dishing up delectable local produce. \u201cAlbania only has one road \u2013 it goes all the way to Kosovo.

It was an oddly reverent take on a somewhat obsessive pursuit, but worth persevering with just to hear the strange, elemental music of <a href=\"http://isung.no/\" title=\"\">Terje Isungset</a>. The Norwegian musician makes actual instruments \u2013 ice trumpets, ice drums, an iceophone \u2013 from chunks of ice extracted from 10,000-year-old frozen lakes. Sometimes, conditions allowing, Isungset even creates entire venues out of ice, and, when touring to warmer climes, transports his instruments in a freezer trailer. \u201cIt is very hard work,\u201d he admitted at one point, \u201cbut I kind of can\u2019t stop it\u2026 When I first hearad the sound of ice, I thought it was beautiful, it was like falling in love.\u201d</p> <p>Over on Radio 3, in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0006swg\" title=\"\"><strong>Cold War in Full Swing</strong></a>, Kevin Le Gendre recalled how East Germany fell in love with the great American jazz trumpeter Louis Armstrong. In 1965, four years after the Berlin Wall went up, Armstrong became the first American jazz performer to tour there, enthralling audiences who had hitherto only been able to buy his records on the black market, so subversive was the music considered.</p> <p>The East German authorities, rightly as it turned out, saw Armstrong\u2019s short tour as a potential propaganda victory. Jazz buffs viewed it as nothing short of miraculous. \u201cIt was like the king coming to his people,\u201d one fan recalled. \u201cA royal, almost divine atmosphere.\u201d The irrepressible Armstrong survived it all with his reputation not just intact, but enhanced. This was a man, after all, whose concert in the Republic of Congo in 1960 caused <a href=\"https://louisarmstrongfellowsblog.wordpress.com/2017/10/30/a-moment-in-time-louis-armstrong-in-leopoldville/\" title=\"\">a one-day truce in the country\u2019s civil war</a>.</p> <p>Another kind of civil war has been raging on American campuses since the 1980s, where the rise of identity politics has placed the issue of free speech, once held sacrosanct by progressive liberals, at the centre of an ongoing and fiercely contested debate about rights, privilege and diversity.

      "bodyText": "Moon (BBC Radio 4) | iPlayer The Dying of the Ice (BBC Radio 4) | iPlayer Louis Armstrong: Cold War in Full Swing (Radio 3 | iPlayer Free Thinking: Camille Paglia (BBC Radio 3) | iPlayer When I interviewed astronaut Eugene Cernan, commander of Apollo 17 and the last man to walk on the moon, he recalled the wondrous moments he had witnessed \u2013 an Earthrise, his own footprints on the lunar surface \u2013 but also the dogged, meticulous schedule the crew were tied to for most of the voyage. Radio 4\u2019s five-part series Moon deftly caught that mixture of the extraordinary and the routine through a reconstruction of the Apollo 11 mission that used the actual words of Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins, taken from Nasa transcripts. Narrated by space scientist Maggie Aderin-Pocock, each short segment unfolded to its own understated rhythm, the matter-of-fact dialogue between ground control and the astronauts itself a kind of well modulated drama. The second episode, Translunar Injection, tracked Apollo 11 as it powered out of earth\u2019s orbit: \u201cWe confirm ignition and the thrust is go.\u201d As Armstrong performed a tricky docking manoeuvre at 23,000mph, there was a sudden, shuddering crash and for a long moment you were there with them, holding your breath. In that instant, the myriad tasks that could have gone wrong were made palpably real. \u201cSafely on their way, the three men can finally get out of their bulky spacesuits,\u201d Aderin-Pocock concluded, \u201cin zero gravity in a cabin the size of a family car.\u201d Back on Earth, our planet\u2019s uncertain future was the unspoken backdrop to The Dying of the Ice: Frozen Music, in which Andrew McGibbon met musicians and composers who use ice to make music. It was an oddly reverent take on a somewhat obsessive pursuit, but worth persevering with just to hear the strange, elemental music of Terje Isungset. The Norwegian musician makes actual instruments \u2013 ice trumpets, ice drums, an iceophone \u2013 from chunks of ice extracted from 10,000-year-old frozen lakes. Sometimes, conditions allowing, Isungset even creates entire venues out of ice, and, when touring to warmer climes, transports his instruments in a freezer trailer. \u201cIt is very hard work,\u201d he admitted at one point, \u201cbut I kind of can\u2019t stop it\u2026 When I first hearad the sound of ice, I thought it was beautiful, it was like falling in love.\u201d Over on Radio 3, in Cold War in Full Swing, Kevin Le Gendre recalled how East Germany fell in love with the great American jazz trumpeter Louis Armstrong. In 1965, four years after the Berlin Wall went up, Armstrong became the first American jazz performer to tour there, enthralling audiences who had hitherto only been able to buy his records on the black market, so subversive was the music considered. The East German authorities, rightly as it turned out, saw Armstrong\u2019s short tour as a potential propaganda victory. Jazz buffs viewed it as nothing short of miraculous. \u201cIt was like the king coming to his people,\u201d one fan recalled. \u201cA royal, almost divine atmosphere.\u201d The irrepressible Armstrong survived it all with his reputation not just intact, but enhanced. This was a man, after all, whose concert in the Republic of Congo in 1960 caused a one-day truce in the country\u2019s civil war. Another kind of civil war has been raging on American campuses since the 1980s, where the rise of identity politics has placed the issue of free speech, once held sacrosanct by progressive liberals, at the centre of an ongoing and fiercely contested debate about rights, privilege and diversity. In her inimitably combative style, the academic and cultural historian, Camille Paglia, has led the counter-charge against what she calls \u201cthe ruthless thought police as dogmatic in their views as agents of the Spanish inquisition\u201d. Paglia was the subject of last week\u2019s extended interview on Free Thinking, where her scholarship and her combativeness were both to the fore. \u201cI was always fanatical in my interests,\u201d she told Philip Dodd, citing her Italian lineage as the source of her \u201cextremely emphatic, uncompromising\u201d views. \u201cI do not,\u201d she added, \u201ccome from a line of doubters.\u201d Whatever your views on Paglia \u2013 and she certainly divides opinion \u2013 she is an entertaining, often surprising interviewee, her nervous urgency and almost biblical certitude often undercut with moments of self-deprecating humour. \u201cI\u2019m persona non grata in the entire academic establishment,\u201d she said, laughing at the very idea. \u201cI love to get under the skin of authority. But everyone\u2019s so boring now.\u201d She lambasted the \u201chyper-emotionalism and hysteria of the post iPhone generation,\u201d the \u201cinstant outrage of social media\u201d and the \u201cshrivelling of academic values as colleges and universities are run as businesses\u201d. When asked what she would like written on her gravestone, she replied: \u201cPrankster.\u201d By the end, I couldn\u2019t help thinking that those who wish to silence her have no idea what they are missing out on.",

      "bodyText": "Now that Wimbledon is over, if you\u2019re looking for something interesting to watch, can I suggest heading over to the video of last week\u2019s interrogation by the US Senate committee on banking, housing and urban affairs of Facebook\u2019s David Marcus? Given the astonishing incompetence of the Senate\u2019s inquisition of Marcus\u2019s boss, Mark Zuckerberg, some time ago, my hopes for last week\u2019s hearing were not high. How wrong can you be? But first a bit of background might be helpful. Facebook, currently the tech world\u2019s most toxic company, has decided to get into the currency business. It proposes to launch a new global cryptocurrency called Libra. Marcus is the guy leading this project. He formerly worked at PayPal and then moved to Facebook, where he ran the company\u2019s Messenger service. At first sight, Marcus appears to be a Smooth Man from central casting. At second sight, he evokes the \u201cuncanny valley\u201d, defined by Wikipedia as \u201ca hypothesised relationship between the degree of an object\u2019s resemblance to a human being and the emotional response to such an object\u201d. In that respect, he is not unlike his boss. To be fair, circumstances had put him on a sticky wicket: shortly before he took the stand, the Federal Trade Commission had handed down a $5bn fine to Facebook for breaking a 2012 Consent Decree to protect the privacy of its users. Marcus had tabled some written testimony, in which he described Libra as \u201ca safe, secure, and low-cost way for people to move money efficiently around the world. We believe that Libra can make real progress toward building a more inclusive financial infrastructure. The journey to get there will be a long one and we recognise that ours has just begun.\u201d In particular, he declared piously, Libra was designed to help \u00e9migr\u00e9s in the rich world to send money to their relatives in the poor world without being ripped off by unscrupulous capitalists. What could be wrong with that? Quite a lot, it seemed. Prior to the hearing, both the US treasury secretary and the chairman of the Federal Reserve had voiced their concerns about Marcus\u2019s new baby.

But all this was kid\u2019s stuff compared with what the ranking member of the committee, Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, had to say. \u201cLike a toddler who has gotten his hands on a book of matches,\u201d he fumed, \u201cFacebook has burned down the house over and over and called every arson a learning experience.

Saynab Hareed, Shukri\u2019s aunt, said the incident occurred earlier this year and proved the school had been acutely aware of the bullying. \u201cShe was getting bullied so badly that on one occasion one of the teachers took Shukri from school to her own house because the teacher was worried for her safety,\u201d said Hareed.</p> <p>Greater Manchester Police say they are still investigating the death and have interviewed four children who were with Shukri when she died. But they say they have uncovered no evidence bullying played a part in what they have called a \u201ctragic incident\u201d.</p> <p>The family, however, complain it is being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/05/protest-in-bury-over-death-by-drowning-of-12-year-old-shukri-yahya-abdi\" title=\"\">left in the dark</a> and has lost faith in the force. \u201cAt first the case was closed within three days and without, we felt, a proper investigation taking place. Only after the protests did they decide to look into more details,\u201d said Hareed.</p> <p>The case has already prompted a series of demonstrations around the country, acting as a lightning rod for refugee groups who believe they have less of a stake in British society. Rakhia Ismail, the mayor of Islington, north London, said the case had raised concerns once again that ethnic groups are treated differently.</p> <p>\u201cPoliticians are interested in our vote, but they do not care for the Somali community. Speaking as a mother, a Muslim and a Somali, we need to get justice for this child,\u201d said Ismail, the UK\u2019s first Somali-born female mayor.</p> <p>Caraweelo Ali, 19, a student who was among hundreds who took part in a protest for Shukri in London last week, said: \u201cHer death and the events surrounding it show that a black Muslim girl doesn\u2019t matter. It has made us all question how refugees are treated in the UK.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, scrutiny continues over the events that led to Shukri\u2019s drowning. The police explanation is that they have not uncovered any suspicious circumstances and that Shukri went into deep water and got into difficulty. However, the family argues that the police have not shared any details of the interviews with the four youngsters who were with Shukri at the scene of the death on 27 June.</p> <p>\u201cWe have no idea who they are, anything. They\u2019re keeping it completely private. We just want to know how did it happen?\u201d added Hareed.</p> <p>The family also has no idea what Shukri was doing between leaving school at 3:30pm until around 11pm when police received the call that she was in the river.</p> <p>Hareed said Shukri had never mentioned a desire to swim, had no towel and was wearing a hijab when she went swimming.</p> <p>One Bury resident, speaking where Shukri is believed to have entered the water, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a weird place to go for a swim, as you can see there\u2019s hardly any water, just rocks and puddles. I\u2019ve slipped there before and scratched my knee.\u201d</p> <p>Shukri\u2019s school, Broad Oak Sports College, says it is currently reviewing its anti-bullying policy and procedures. Despite being repeatedly asked by the <em>Observer</em> to comment, it had not responded at the time of publication.</p> <p>Shukri\u2019s mother made a series of verbal complaints about bullying for more than a year and Hareed, despite living in London, also made a complaint herself, because the family was so upset about the situation.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/james-frith-investigation-into-bullying-policy-at-broadoak-high-school-bury-lancashire\" title=\"\">petition </a>calling for the local Labour MP, James Frith, to demand an investigation into whether the school failed to properly address bullying has collected more than 77,500 signatures.

Saynab Hareed, Shukri\u2019s aunt, said the incident occurred earlier this year and proved the school had been acutely aware of the bullying. \u201cShe was getting bullied so badly that on one occasion one of the teachers took Shukri from school to her own house because the teacher was worried for her safety,\u201d said Hareed. Greater Manchester Police say they are still investigating the death and have interviewed four children who were with Shukri when she died. But they say they have uncovered no evidence bullying played a part in what they have called a \u201ctragic incident\u201d. The family, however, complain it is being left in the dark and has lost faith in the force. \u201cAt first the case was closed within three days and without, we felt, a proper investigation taking place. Only after the protests did they decide to look into more details,\u201d said Hareed. The case has already prompted a series of demonstrations around the country, acting as a lightning rod for refugee groups who believe they have less of a stake in British society. Rakhia Ismail, the mayor of Islington, north London, said the case had raised concerns once again that ethnic groups are treated differently. \u201cPoliticians are interested in our vote, but they do not care for the Somali community. Speaking as a mother, a Muslim and a Somali, we need to get justice for this child,\u201d said Ismail, the UK\u2019s first Somali-born female mayor. Caraweelo Ali, 19, a student who was among hundreds who took part in a protest for Shukri in London last week, said: \u201cHer death and the events surrounding it show that a black Muslim girl doesn\u2019t matter. It has made us all question how refugees are treated in the UK.\u201d Meanwhile, scrutiny continues over the events that led to Shukri\u2019s drowning. The police explanation is that they have not uncovered any suspicious circumstances and that Shukri went into deep water and got into difficulty. However, the family argues that the police have not shared any details of the interviews with the four youngsters who were with Shukri at the scene of the death on 27 June. \u201cWe have no idea who they are, anything. They\u2019re keeping it completely private. We just want to know how did it happen?\u201d added Hareed. The family also has no idea what Shukri was doing between leaving school at 3:30pm until around 11pm when police received the call that she was in the river. Hareed said Shukri had never mentioned a desire to swim, had no towel and was wearing a hijab when she went swimming. One Bury resident, speaking where Shukri is believed to have entered the water, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a weird place to go for a swim, as you can see there\u2019s hardly any water, just rocks and puddles. I\u2019ve slipped there before and scratched my knee.\u201d Shukri\u2019s school, Broad Oak Sports College, says it is currently reviewing its anti-bullying policy and procedures. Despite being repeatedly asked by the Observer to comment, it had not responded at the time of publication. Shukri\u2019s mother made a series of verbal complaints about bullying for more than a year and Hareed, despite living in London, also made a complaint herself, because the family was so upset about the situation. A petition calling for the local Labour MP, James Frith, to demand an investigation into whether the school failed to properly address bullying has collected more than 77,500 signatures. Elsewhere a crowdfunding effort to support Shukri\u2019s family has reached its \u00a310,000 target after more than 580 people donated.",

Rather than this being the EU \u201ctaking a tough line\u201d against overbearing US tech companies, Washington seems to have forgotten how to implement its own antitrust laws.</p> <p>There was a time when Congress would seek to limit corporate power. Probably the last hurrah for anti-trust campaigners was the break up of telecoms giant AT&amp;T in the 1980s.</p> <p>The House of Representatives has recently woken up to the problems of tech power and only last week a subcommittee of the House judiciary committee quizzed senior executives from Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google.</p> <p>But while the Democrat-controlled House is stirring itself, there is little sign that either the Senate or the White House have any appetite for a crackdown.</p> <p>That leaves the EU as the only body with any power prepared to examine the influence of an army of tech firms that handle a growing number of commercial transactions, and store and manipulate data to increase their dominance further in ways that few understand.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/17/margrethe-vestager-people-feel-angry-about-tax-avoidance-european-competition-commissioner\" title=\"\">In an interview with this newspaper in 2017</a>, Vestager denied that the subtext of her investigations was to harmonise tax rules as part of an EU superstate or to stifle tech advances. \u201cWe are doing this because people are angry about tax avoidance,\u201d she said. \u201cThe thinking was: \u2018Let\u2019s try to do something different within the system we have\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Should the UK quit the EU, it will come to miss Vestager\u2019s rigorous questioning of market dominance and data privacy.

It seems to involve bidding for any high street chain that struggles to stay afloat, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/30/fears-for-uk-jobs-as-sports-direct-buys-up-evans-cycles\" title=\"\">Evans Cycles</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/01/mike-ashley-adds-sofa-com-to-his-high-street-empire-sports-direct\" title=\"\">sofa.com</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/aug/10/house-of-fraser-calls-in-administrators-as-rescue-talks-fail\" title=\"\">House of Fraser</a>. Now Sports Direct\u2019s auditors also appear baffled. Grant Thornton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/15/sports-direct-delays-results-amid-house-of-fraser-woes\" title=\"\">wants more time to complete its audit</a> of the numbers for the financial year that ended in April.</p> <p>The figures have to be published soon, whatever \u201ccomplexities\u201d have been created by the integration of House of Fraser. Sports Direct gave itself until 23 August. But non-Ashley shareholders will want to see more than just the numbers.</p> <p>First, they\u2019ll want a plan for HoF beyond boasts about making it \u201cthe Harrods of the high street\u201d. How much investment will be required, on top of the \u00a390m paid to buy the department store chain out of administration last year? Does Ashley know how many stores are viable in the medium term? And, since help from landlords and councils was previously described as crucial, has it been forthcoming? At the moment, the financial projections for HoF are a mystery.</p> <p>Second, Sports Direct should show it has the capacity to manage its now sprawling empire. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/02/mike-ashley-karen-byers-quits-sports-direct\" title=\"\">Karen Byers, a key lieutenant for 28 years, has left</a>. Will she be replaced? One of investors\u2019 worries is that Ashley\u2019s obsession with new retail adventures is leaving the core Sports Direct business exposed. JD Sports is now a FTSE 100 company; Ashley\u2019s creation isn\u2019t.</p> <p>Third, does the HoF purchase mark the end of the big deals? It should. Ashley\u2019s record as a buyer of stakes in other people\u2019s businesses is dreadful. The doomed attempt to buy Debenhams involved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/09/sports-direct-lost-series-retail-punts-debenhams\" title=\"\">a write-off of \u00a3150m</a>, a financial disaster that would have cost other chief executives their job. That won\u2019t happen, obviously, because Ashley owns 62% of Sports Direct. He does, though, still have a duty to demonstrate to other shareholders that he won\u2019t squander more of their money on speculative punts.</p> <h2>Google brings Viagogo to heel </h2> <p>No matter how lengthy the queue to condemn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/may/30/viagogo-what-is-it-secondary-ticketing-website\" title=\"\">Viagogo, the controversial ticket resale site</a> marches on, unscathed and apparently impervious to criticism.</p> <p>It <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/05/viagogo-refusal-speak-mps-in-house-commons-gross-discourtesy\" title=\"\">twice refused</a> to turn up to select committee hearings, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/may/30/ticket-website-viagogo-singled-out-by-uk-government\" title=\"\">brushed off calls for a boycott</a> from the digital minister, and even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/sep/04/viagogo-sues-ed-sheeran-promotion-company-ticket-resale\" title=\"\">sued global pop megastar Ed Sheeran\u2019s management team</a>. This week it stared down the Competition and Markets Authority and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jul/18/competition-watchdog-warns-viagogo-court-action-will-continue\" title=\"\">accused the regulator</a>, which is pursuing court action against the company, of being ill-suited to judging whether it is compliant with consumer law.</p> <p>But Viagogo may finally have met its match. In the world of nebulous, apparently unaccountable web-based entities, Google is very much the alpha.</p> <p>Viagogo has prospered in large part thanks to its use of Google\u2019s AdWords service, which allows companies to pay to appear in the adverts featured at the top of search results.</p> <p>Unwitting fans desperate to see their idols often click on the first link they see, never stopping to question who they\u2019ll end up buying from \u2013 often a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/15/shady-world-of-the-ticket-touts\" title=\"\">professional tout charging massive mark-ups</a>.</p> <p>Now Google has responded to the chorus of concern about the company by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jul/17/google-suspends-ticket-website-viagogo-from-its-search-rankings\" title=\"\">suspending Viagogo\u2019s ads</a>, something campaigners have long called for.</p> <p>The result is that its tickets site appears have tumbled down the list of search results, making potential customers far less likely to spot it among its competitors.</p> <p>That presents a clear and present danger to Viagogo\u2019s business model. Swiss law allows the Geneva-based company to keep its accounts secret, so the effect on its top line will probably never be known.</p> <p>But its timid response to Google \u2013 a brief couple of lines offering to work with the search engine giant to resolve its concerns \u2013 was in marked contrast to the chest-thumping defiance with which it has responded to everyone else.</p> <p>That tells its own story.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The greatest economic threat facing Europe is of falling hopelessly behind the US and China in adopting the next generation of technology. That is the view of many across Europe\u2019s industrial and financial sectors who watch with wonder the proxy battle between the US and Chinese administrations on behalf of their tech giants. Business leaders from Dublin to Warsaw are open-mouthed \u2013 not so much at the often-bizarre tug of war between the two sides as at the fact that these economic blocs can lay claim to almost all the world\u2019s tech giants. Some blame EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager, whom tech billionaires now regard as one of their few true foes. It was she who forced Apple to pay \u20ac13bn in back taxes after ruling that its tax deal with the Irish government amounted to illegal state aid. Vestager has also taken on Amazon and Facebook and Google and Microsoft and forced them to pay hefty fines or reparations. Last week, the former Danish MP said she wanted to take \u201ca very close look\u201d at whether Amazon\u2019s business practices broke EU antitrust rules. This is a separate probe from the examination of Amazon\u2019s dominance of e-books. Now she has targeted Amazon\u2019s treatment of third-party sellers, which generate around 58% of sales. An investigation of Apple\u2019s dominance of music streaming, triggered by a complaint from Spotify, is expected soon. Donald Trump says Vestager is motivated by a hatred of the US. And some in the UK believe this roll call of prosecutions is stifling the adoption of digital commerce. Evidence for either view is scant. Rather than this being the EU \u201ctaking a tough line\u201d against overbearing US tech companies, Washington seems to have forgotten how to implement its own antitrust laws. There was a time when Congress would seek to limit corporate power. Probably the last hurrah for anti-trust campaigners was the break up of telecoms giant AT&amp;T in the 1980s. The House of Representatives has recently woken up to the problems of tech power and only last week a subcommittee of the House judiciary committee quizzed senior executives from Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. But while the Democrat-controlled House is stirring itself, there is little sign that either the Senate or the White House have any appetite for a crackdown. That leaves the EU as the only body with any power prepared to examine the influence of an army of tech firms that handle a growing number of commercial transactions, and store and manipulate data to increase their dominance further in ways that few understand. In an interview with this newspaper in 2017, Vestager denied that the subtext of her investigations was to harmonise tax rules as part of an EU superstate or to stifle tech advances. \u201cWe are doing this because people are angry about tax avoidance,\u201d she said. \u201cThe thinking was: \u2018Let\u2019s try to do something different within the system we have\u2019.\u201d Should the UK quit the EU, it will come to miss Vestager\u2019s rigorous questioning of market dominance and data privacy. Britain will simply lack the clout to take on the US behemoths, even in the unlikely event that a Tory government seeks to protect its citizens from what is brewing into the most colossal market failure in digital commerce. As for Europe\u2019s failure to develop any of its own great tech firms or even a robust and superfast digital infrastructure, maybe Vestager, who has been promoted to be one of two deputies to new EU commission boss Ursula von der Leyen, will find herself with the economic brief and move as quickly to create digital businesses as she did to limit the power of wily foreign invaders. Ashley and the wrong kind of shopping spree Mike Ashley\u2019s acquisition strategy at Sports Direct is baffling. It seems to involve bidding for any high street chain that struggles to stay afloat, from Evans Cycles to sofa.com to House of Fraser. Now Sports Direct\u2019s auditors also appear baffled. Grant Thornton wants more time to complete its audit of the numbers for the financial year that ended in April. The figures have to be published soon, whatever \u201ccomplexities\u201d have been created by the integration of House of Fraser. Sports Direct gave itself until 23 August. But non-Ashley shareholders will want to see more than just the numbers. First, they\u2019ll want a plan for HoF beyond boasts about making it \u201cthe Harrods of the high street\u201d. How much investment will be required, on top of the \u00a390m paid to buy the department store chain out of administration last year? Does Ashley know how many stores are viable in the medium term? And, since help from landlords and councils was previously described as crucial, has it been forthcoming? At the moment, the financial projections for HoF are a mystery. Second, Sports Direct should show it has the capacity to manage its now sprawling empire. Karen Byers, a key lieutenant for 28 years, has left. Will she be replaced? One of investors\u2019 worries is that Ashley\u2019s obsession with new retail adventures is leaving the core Sports Direct business exposed. JD Sports is now a FTSE 100 company; Ashley\u2019s creation isn\u2019t. Third, does the HoF purchase mark the end of the big deals? It should. Ashley\u2019s record as a buyer of stakes in other people\u2019s businesses is dreadful. The doomed attempt to buy Debenhams involved a write-off of \u00a3150m, a financial disaster that would have cost other chief executives their job. That won\u2019t happen, obviously, because Ashley owns 62% of Sports Direct. He does, though, still have a duty to demonstrate to other shareholders that he won\u2019t squander more of their money on speculative punts. Google brings Viagogo to heel No matter how lengthy the queue to condemn Viagogo, the controversial ticket resale site marches on, unscathed and apparently impervious to criticism. It twice refused to turn up to select committee hearings, brushed off calls for a boycott from the digital minister, and even sued global pop megastar Ed Sheeran\u2019s management team. This week it stared down the Competition and Markets Authority and accused the regulator, which is pursuing court action against the company, of being ill-suited to judging whether it is compliant with consumer law. But Viagogo may finally have met its match. In the world of nebulous, apparently unaccountable web-based entities, Google is very much the alpha. Viagogo has prospered in large part thanks to its use of Google\u2019s AdWords service, which allows companies to pay to appear in the adverts featured at the top of search results. Unwitting fans desperate to see their idols often click on the first link they see, never stopping to question who they\u2019ll end up buying from \u2013 often a professional tout charging massive mark-ups. Now Google has responded to the chorus of concern about the company by suspending Viagogo\u2019s ads, something campaigners have long called for. The result is that its tickets site appears have tumbled down the list of search results, making potential customers far less likely to spot it among its competitors. That presents a clear and present danger to Viagogo\u2019s business model. Swiss law allows the Geneva-based company to keep its accounts secret, so the effect on its top line will probably never be known. But its timid response to Google \u2013 a brief couple of lines offering to work with the search engine giant to resolve its concerns \u2013 was in marked contrast to the chest-thumping defiance with which it has responded to everyone else. That tells its own story.",

      "bodyText": "Seven artists have removed their work from the 2019 Whitney Biennial, citing the New York museum\u2019s lack of response to calls for the resignation of a board member with ties to trade in law enforcement supplies. The removals from the prestigious survey of American art come after 46 of 75 artists picked for the show signed a letter in March demanding the resignation of Warren Kanders, a vice-president of the Whitney board with ties to a company that distributes equipment including teargas that the letter said has been used on migrants at the Mexican border, Palestinians in Gaza, protesters in Egypt and Puerto Rico, and against Native Americans protesting a pipeline at Standing Rock. Many still exhibited but the protest was joined by more than 100 artists including Barbara Kruger and Nan Goldin, as well as dozens of curators, critics and theorists. In a letter to the Whitney curators, the six artists who removed their work on Friday and Saturday (another cancelled his involvement before the show opened) said they were angered and conflicted by Kanders\u2019 connections to Safariland, a distribution company. Eddie Arroyo, Agustina Woodgate, Korakrit Arunanondchai, Meriem Bennani, Nicole Eisenman, Nicholas Galanin and Christine Sun Kim said the Whitney board\u2019s failure to meaningfully respond to the March letter had forced their hand. \u201cGrowing pressure from artists and activists has made our participation untenable,\u201d read their letter, which was obtained by ArtForum. \u201cThe museum\u2019s inertia has turned the screw, and we refuse further complicity with Kanders and his technologies of violence.\u201d Also on Saturday, the London-based collective Forensic Architecture requested that a 10-minute video called \u201cTriple-Chaser\u201d, made with Praxis Films, which is run by the film-maker Laura Poitras, be taken down. Forensic Architecture said one of its researchers found what they believe to be direct evidence linking the firm to violence classified by the United Nations in a recent report as a potential war crime. After the requests to withdraw the works were made public, museum director Adam Weinberg said in a statement: \u201cThe Whitney respects the opinions of all the artists it exhibits and stands by their right to express themselves freely.\u201d The museum was \u201csaddened\u201d he said, adding \u201cwe will of course comply with the artists\u2019 request\u201d. Art institutions are increasingly exposed over the sources of their funding. In June, Yana Peel, the chief executive of the Serpentine Galleries in London, stepped down after she was linked in a Guardian report to the Israeli cybersecurity firm NSO, which has been criticised by human rights organisations. Protests organised by Goldin at the Metropolitan and Guggenheim museums in New York, and regarding the Tate in London and the Louvre in Paris, with the anti-opioid group Pain, have forced several institutions to refuse funding from the Sackler family, whose firm, Purdue Pharma, has been accused of a role in triggering the opioid-abuse crisis. In March, some Sackler philanthropic groups said they would suspend giving. Michael Quinn, a lawyer who works with Goldin and Pain, told the Guardian artists were merely stepping into a vacuum \u201ccreated by government and corporate leaders\u2019 failure to address some very basic societal problems\u201d. \u201cI see artists increasingly stepping in as the voice of change,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is clear from in the political work being exhibited.\u201d The signatories of the March Whitney letter said \u201cthe stakes of the demand to remove Kanders are high and extend far beyond the art world. \u201cCultural institutions like the Whitney are among the few spaces in public life today that claim to be devoted to ideals of education, creativity and dissent beyond the dictates of the market. Yet these institutions have been historically entwined with the power structures of settler colonialism, white supremacy, heteropatriarchy and capitalism.\u201d The art world, the Washington Post said recently, is full of \u201cgood places to convert roughly obtained private wealth into social prestige\u201d. But it is being roiled by identity politics. To many artists, this is both heroic and antagonizing. \u201cThe art world\u2019s anti-corporatism can seem hypocritical,\u201d said the New York artist and critic Walter Robinson. \u201cBut don\u2019t forget art is a luxury business supported by billionaires and the avant garde art is [a] product of the 1%.\u201d Robinson said museums and institutions anxious about their endowments would be better off considering such money as fines to be paid. But that, he conceded, is unlikely. \u201cIdentity is now an essential element in art \u2013 and identity is political,\u201d he said. \u201cArt used to gain its power from aesthetic invention but it now seeks relevance by aligning itself with progressive politics.\u201d The artist Marilyn Minter, long rumored to be a member of Guerrilla Girls, a feminist activist group that has protested gender and ethnic bias in culture since the 1980s, said: \u201cNan Goldin is my hero.\u201d \u201cI fucking hate the art world,\u201d she added.",

      "body": "<h2>1. Blond ambition<br></h2> <p>Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson was born on 19 June 1964 in New York and is still known by his family as Al. Over the next 14 years he moved house 32 times across two continents as his father Stanley pursued a wide-ranging career. Only 22 when she had him, his mother Charlotte had given up her English degree at Oxford to accompany her husband to the US. Until the age of eight Boris was severely deaf with glue ear and was a subdued child. His mother encouraged him to be arty but Stanley inculcated an uber-competitive streak in his family.</p> <p>Winning was the priority, whether running fastest, jumping highest or having the blondest hair, leading the young Al to set his sights on becoming \u201cworld king\u201d. Unable to cope with with the constant moves and Stanley\u2019s womanising, Charlotte suffered a severe breakdown when the family went to Brussels. Her absence in hospital led to the Johnson brood having to learn how to fend for themselves.</p> <h2>2.

By the time he went on to Eton, this public version of Al was growing more flamboyant \u2013 a transformation he enforced by changing to the more distinctive name of Boris. As his schoolwork suffered, he impressed but also infuriated his teachers with his \u201cdisgracefully cavalier attitude\u201d.</p> <h2>3. Oxford chameleon</h2> <p>Johnson went to Oxford in 1983 having, despite his teachers\u2019 misgivings, won a scholarship to study classics at Balliol. It seemed that all the glittering prizes would fall into his lap, including membership of the Bullingdon Club, an upper-class drinking society renowned for its casual vandalism of other people\u2019s rooms, property and feelings. One trophy that eluded him at his first attempt was the presidency of the Oxford Union. He barely bothered to canvass beyond public school alumni and was defeated by a slick Liberal grammar school boy. Failure struck Johnson almost as a bereavement, but he learned from it.

World on speed dial</h2> <p>As soon as he graduated with a 2:1 in 1987 Johnson married the beautiful and wealthy Allegra Mostyn-Owen at a wedding celebrated with a specially commissioned violin duet. Soon he landed a plum job in journalism, assisted by formidable family connections,including his godmother, the writer Rachel Billington (daughter of Lord Longford and sister of Lady Antonia Fraser). He was taken on as a graduate trainee at the <em>Times</em>, but the shambolic Boris persona did not impress his news editors. The star of Eton and Oxford was given low-grade work and, desperate for glory, made up a quote to sex up a story and attributed it to his godfather, the academic Colin Lucas. Lucas complained to editor Charlie Wilson, who sacked the young trainee.</p> <h2>5.

Hastings was a more accommodating employer and in 1989 promoted his protege to become Brussels correspondent when he was just 25. Over the next five years Johnson made his name by almost singlehandedly developing a compelling narrative that everything emanating from the EU was either loony or sinister. Towards the end of his time in Brussels his distorted stories had damaged his credibility among his peers in Europe but back home he was becoming a household name. It was his first taste of power and he revelled in it.</p> <h2>6.

He also acquired a column in the <em>Spectator</em>, which he littered with such terms as \u201cpiccaninny\u201d and \u201cpuffing coolies\u201d. The chilling tape of his conversation with his friend Darius Guppy, a convicted fraudster, in which he agreed to help Guppy with his plan to beat up a journalist, also came to light. But it was fashionable at the time to rail against so-called political correctness and to some Johnson seemed like a breath of fresh air.</p> <p>When he was invited on <em>Have I Got News for You</em> in 1998, the Guppy tape was raised again but Johnson made the audience laugh with him by rolling his eyes and ruffling his hair and won a vast new following. What should have sunk him had made him untouchable.</p> <h2>7. The Sextator</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50deb45ee0b6203986bdc444d183549f4afb87f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50deb45ee0b6203986bdc444d183549f4afb87f1/0_260_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson and Petronella Wyatt at the Spectator summer party at the magazine\u2019s offices in Doughty Street, London in July 2006.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson and Petronella Wyatt at the Spectator summer party at the magazine\u2019s offices in Doughty Street, London in July 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Davidson/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Johnson was now intent on<em> cashing in on his fame and</em> launching his political career, but in 1999<em>,</em> <em>just after his 35th birthday,</em> he was made editor of the <em>Spectator</em> on the explicit understanding he would drop his parliamentary ambitions. Within two years, however, he had become MP for <em>the plum Tory seat of </em>Henley, promising its residents that he would step down from the <em>Spectator</em> \u2013 but he stayed on for four years.</p> <p>It was not just his employers and voters whom he thus betrayed but also his second wife Marina, whom he had married while still in Brussels. During his six years as editor the magazine, now dubbed the Sextator, became a byword for lasciviousness. One of Johnson\u2019s longest liaisons at this time was with his columnist Petronella Wyatt, but he lied about the affair to Tory leader Michael Howard\u2019s communications chief Guy Black. When sacked for dishonesty, he insisted that it was acceptable, even desirable, to lie.</p> <h2>8. Mr Mayor</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1bd765b41e5b80a688a5d53488e57d71fabf790\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1bd765b41e5b80a688a5d53488e57d71fabf790/0_0_4080_2448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mayor of London Boris Johnson after he gets stuck on a zipwire during BT London Live in Victoria Park in August 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mayor of London Boris Johnson after he gets stuck on a zipwire during BT London Live in Victoria Park in August 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Barcroft Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Johnson\u2019s first stint as an MP was hardly a storming success, and reports of more affairs did not help. Insult was added to injury when David Cameron, a fellow Etonian two years his junior, became Tory leader. When he omitted to raise Johnson to his shadow cabinet, Johnson\u2019s chances of advancement seemed vanishingly thin. No wonder that when the Tory candidacy for the London mayoralty was offered to him, he was interested. A disciplined campaign catapulted Johnson into City Hall in 2008. The shine wore off almost instantly, however, when it became clear he had virtually no plans. Many appointments made in indecent haste ended in sackings, resignations, accusations of lying and racism and even a criminal conviction. And yet he won again in 2012, going global at the Olympics by allowing himself to get stuck in front of the world\u2019s cameras on a zipwire.</p> <h2>9. Leave</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"27696ea3be12971acba062d824bc4774e8ee24c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27696ea3be12971acba062d824bc4774e8ee24c6/0_75_5379_3228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson speaks in front of the famous Brexit battle bus in York during the Vote Leave campaign tour of the UK in May 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson speaks in front of the famous Brexit battle bus in York during the Vote Leave campaign tour of the UK in May 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Red Boris \u2013 pro-cycling, pro-Europe, pro-immigration, anti-Trump \u2013 had won London but by the end of his second term the old, bluer version of Boris was back. Pandering to the new rightward swing of the Conservative party, Johnson positioned himself to attack by standing for parliament again a year before he was due to leave City Hall. In 2016 he famously wrote two columns setting out an argument for both sides of the EU referendum. But clearly his best chance of removing his Remain rival Cameron from Downing Street was by backing Leave, and he did so with his characteristic campaigning flair and disdain for facts and rules. After his side won, it looked as if he would become PM. But when fellow Leave campaigner Michael Gove declared him unfit to lead the country through Brexit \u2013 and even questioned his true commitment to leaving the EU<em> \u2013 </em>Johnson\u2019s hopes were quashed and Theresa May came to power instead.</p> <h2>10.

Frustration at his failure to read briefs, however, turned to fury over his gratuitous causing of offence to foreigners. Perhaps his greatest crime was his careless words that directly led to the extension of the prison sentence in Iran of the young British-Iranian woman Nazanin Zhagari-Ratcliffe. Regarded as one of the worst foreign secretaries in history, he resigned in 2018 in protest at May\u2019s deal with the EU, describing it as a \u201cturd\u201d (although he later went on to vote for it.) Such details, however, passed by President Trump, who has repeatedly hailed Johnson as the best person to become Britain\u2019s next prime minister. If he does take possession of No 10, as expected, we will soon find out how much more the two men have in common than extraordinary hair.</p> <p><em>Sonia Purnell is the author of Just Boris: A Tale of Blond Ambition</em></p>",

Towards the end of his time in Brussels his distorted stories had damaged his credibility among his peers in Europe but back home he was becoming a household name. It was his first taste of power and he revelled in it. 6. The TV personality Johnson was brought back to London in 1994 and elevated to the Telegraph\u2019s assistant editor and chief political columnist \u2013 although he privately confessed to a colleague to not possessing \u201cany political opinions\u201d. He also acquired a column in the Spectator, which he littered with such terms as \u201cpiccaninny\u201d and \u201cpuffing coolies\u201d. The chilling tape of his conversation with his friend Darius Guppy, a convicted fraudster, in which he agreed to help Guppy with his plan to beat up a journalist, also came to light. But it was fashionable at the time to rail against so-called political correctness and to some Johnson seemed like a breath of fresh air. When he was invited on Have I Got News for You in 1998, the Guppy tape was raised again but Johnson made the audience laugh with him by rolling his eyes and ruffling his hair and won a vast new following. What should have sunk him had made him untouchable. 7. The Sextator Johnson was now intent on cashing in on his fame and launching his political career, but in 1999, just after his 35th birthday, he was made editor of the Spectator on the explicit understanding he would drop his parliamentary ambitions. Within two years, however, he had become MP for the plum Tory seat of Henley, promising its residents that he would step down from the Spectator \u2013 but he stayed on for four years. It was not just his employers and voters whom he thus betrayed but also his second wife Marina, whom he had married while still in Brussels. During his six years as editor the magazine, now dubbed the Sextator, became a byword for lasciviousness. One of Johnson\u2019s longest liaisons at this time was with his columnist Petronella Wyatt, but he lied about the affair to Tory leader Michael Howard\u2019s communications chief Guy Black. When sacked for dishonesty, he insisted that it was acceptable, even desirable, to lie. 8. Mr Mayor Johnson\u2019s first stint as an MP was hardly a storming success, and reports of more affairs did not help. Insult was added to injury when David Cameron, a fellow Etonian two years his junior, became Tory leader. When he omitted to raise Johnson to his shadow cabinet, Johnson\u2019s chances of advancement seemed vanishingly thin. No wonder that when the Tory candidacy for the London mayoralty was offered to him, he was interested. A disciplined campaign catapulted Johnson into City Hall in 2008. The shine wore off almost instantly, however, when it became clear he had virtually no plans. Many appointments made in indecent haste ended in sackings, resignations, accusations of lying and racism and even a criminal conviction. And yet he won again in 2012, going global at the Olympics by allowing himself to get stuck in front of the world\u2019s cameras on a zipwire. 9. Leave Red Boris \u2013 pro-cycling, pro-Europe, pro-immigration, anti-Trump \u2013 had won London but by the end of his second term the old, bluer version of Boris was back. Pandering to the new rightward swing of the Conservative party, Johnson positioned himself to attack by standing for parliament again a year before he was due to leave City Hall. In 2016 he famously wrote two columns setting out an argument for both sides of the EU referendum. But clearly his best chance of removing his Remain rival Cameron from Downing Street was by backing Leave, and he did so with his characteristic campaigning flair and disdain for facts and rules. After his side won, it looked as if he would become PM. But when fellow Leave campaigner Michael Gove declared him unfit to lead the country through Brexit \u2013 and even questioned his true commitment to leaving the EU \u2013 Johnson\u2019s hopes were quashed and Theresa May came to power instead. 10. Final lap To general astonishment \u2013 including probably his own \u2013 May made Johnson her foreign secretary despite obvious antipathy between them. Frustration at his failure to read briefs, however, turned to fury over his gratuitous causing of offence to foreigners. Perhaps his greatest crime was his careless words that directly led to the extension of the prison sentence in Iran of the young British-Iranian woman Nazanin Zhagari-Ratcliffe. Regarded as one of the worst foreign secretaries in history, he resigned in 2018 in protest at May\u2019s deal with the EU, describing it as a \u201cturd\u201d (although he later went on to vote for it.) Such details, however, passed by President Trump, who has repeatedly hailed Johnson as the best person to become Britain\u2019s next prime minister. If he does take possession of No 10, as expected, we will soon find out how much more the two men have in common than extraordinary hair.

      "body": "<p>Even in times of relative calm, British politics rarely allows party leaders to bow out on a high. Just a few months ago, it appeared that Sir Vince Cable\u2019s tenure as Liberal Democrat leader would end in a similar whimper.</p> <p>Yet as he contemplates his party\u2019s mixed fortunes, from the collapse in support after the coalition years to its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/jul/18/has-brexit-saved-the-lib-dems\" title=\"\">recent recovery</a> from the brink of the abyss, he is convinced it is now well placed to be part of a broader revival of liberal, mainstream politics that not so very long ago had seemingly gone out of fashion.</p> <p>\u201cIf you go back over the history of the 1920s and 30s, there was a slow death of liberal England,\u201d Cable says, speaking to the <em>Observer</em> before his successor is announced this week. \u201cYou could perhaps have the slow rebirth through a series of stages. It probably won\u2019t happen in just one general election. I can see a series of electoral events in which cracks emerge and develop in the existing structures and people get together in a different way.\u201d</p> <p>Cable is keen that his replacement go much further in plotting a Remain alliance with like-minded parties \u2013 suggesting that it could be the catalyst for a major realignment of British politics. And while he is heading to the backbenches, he is ready and willing to help with the heavy lifting that will be needed.</p> <p>\u201cPeople might not see me as a good figurehead, but I\u2019m certainly willing to be part of it,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The Lib Dems have already managed to negotiate an alliance with the Greens and Plaid Cymru in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/07/brecon-byelection-battle--remain-alliance-quiet-revolution\" title=\"\">Brecon and Radnorshire byelection</a> next month to maximise the chances of victory for an unambiguously pro-Remain party. Now Cable is calling on his party to go \u201cquite a long way\u201d further in forging a national alliance. He is also holding out the possibility of working with some Tories and Labour, should it change course.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1030797d1a22f19be458857d09f0953317cb0b80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1030797d1a22f19be458857d09f0953317cb0b80/0_199_4940_2966/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lib Dem leadership candidates Jo Swinson and Sir Ed Davey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lib Dem leadership candidates Jo Swinson and Sir Ed Davey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m genuinely interested in these attempts to get cross-party working, getting people working with us, unite for Remain,\u201d he says. \u201cI think there is a lot more to be done in that space. If I can help on that, I will.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t work with [Jeremy] Corbyn and his entourage. Not because of Jeremy personally, but the cabal \u2013 we couldn\u2019t work with them. But you can envisage circumstances in which the Labour party fundamentally changes and we could work with them. There is a dispiritingly small number of Tories who seem willing to stand up and be counted \u2013 we could work with them, and we have form in that area.\u201d</p> <p>Cable believes it is possible for the Lib Dems to become the largest party at the next election, which he expects to happen in the spring at the latest. He says his successor faces a \u201cmajor strategic choice\u201d over whether to continue the party\u2019s attempts to rebuild by narrowly targeting seats or to adopt a much more ambitious programme.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the big choice that the leader and party conference in September will have to make,\u201d he says. \u201cMy instincts are that we can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t abandon the targeting. This idea of working at the grassroots and really building up a local base is absolutely fundamental to our success, to the extent that we\u2019ve had it, and you can\u2019t walk away from that. But there is a potential upside that we\u2019ve got to imagine too.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/11/the-guardian-view-on-the-lib-dem-leadership-contest-its-not-just-about-brexit\" title=\"\">next Lib Dem leader</a> will be revealed this week, with Jo Swinson the favourite to defeat Ed Davey. However, several sources have indicated that votes received so far suggest a 50/50 split between the two candidates, meaning a surprise result is possible.</p> <p>Cable describes his experience as leader as \u201cmixed\u201d. He has been frustrated by some of the behind-the-scenes battles necessary to safeguard the party, which only months ago was fighting for its future before a major upturn in its electoral fortunes. However, he is happy to have met activists outside the \u201cWestminster bubble\u201d, something he describes as the top perk.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b7f5fd5f8645e2a754eb218d1d450cb65ff5f89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b7f5fd5f8645e2a754eb218d1d450cb65ff5f89/0_110_1908_1144/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cable in 2010 with then party leader Nick Clegg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cable in 2010 with then party leader Nick Clegg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rui Vieira/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He regrets being associated with an attempt to oust Nick Clegg as Lib Dem leader at the end of the coalition years (a \u201cpainful episode\u201d, he says, though insisting he was not directly involved), and also believes he would have done a \u201cgood job\u201d had he been able to run for leader in 2007.</p> <p>Had it been offered in the immediate aftermath of the referendum, he says he would have voted for a soft Brexit compromise. Now, he fears, there is no chance of such an agreement. The most likely outcome, in his view, is that Boris Johnson will slightly alter Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal, \u201cthe \u2018lipstick on a pig\u2019 kind of thing\u201d, and win enough votes.</p> <p>He is seriously concerned about the looming risk of a recession and how powerless governments and central banks could be should it arrive.

      "bodyText": "Even in times of relative calm, British politics rarely allows party leaders to bow out on a high. Just a few months ago, it appeared that Sir Vince Cable\u2019s tenure as Liberal Democrat leader would end in a similar whimper. Yet as he contemplates his party\u2019s mixed fortunes, from the collapse in support after the coalition years to its recent recovery from the brink of the abyss, he is convinced it is now well placed to be part of a broader revival of liberal, mainstream politics that not so very long ago had seemingly gone out of fashion. \u201cIf you go back over the history of the 1920s and 30s, there was a slow death of liberal England,\u201d Cable says, speaking to the Observer before his successor is announced this week. \u201cYou could perhaps have the slow rebirth through a series of stages. It probably won\u2019t happen in just one general election. I can see a series of electoral events in which cracks emerge and develop in the existing structures and people get together in a different way.\u201d Cable is keen that his replacement go much further in plotting a Remain alliance with like-minded parties \u2013 suggesting that it could be the catalyst for a major realignment of British politics. And while he is heading to the backbenches, he is ready and willing to help with the heavy lifting that will be needed. \u201cPeople might not see me as a good figurehead, but I\u2019m certainly willing to be part of it,\u201d he says. The Lib Dems have already managed to negotiate an alliance with the Greens and Plaid Cymru in the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection next month to maximise the chances of victory for an unambiguously pro-Remain party. Now Cable is calling on his party to go \u201cquite a long way\u201d further in forging a national alliance. He is also holding out the possibility of working with some Tories and Labour, should it change course. \u201cI\u2019m genuinely interested in these attempts to get cross-party working, getting people working with us, unite for Remain,\u201d he says. \u201cI think there is a lot more to be done in that space. If I can help on that, I will. \u201cWe can\u2019t work with [Jeremy] Corbyn and his entourage. Not because of Jeremy personally, but the cabal \u2013 we couldn\u2019t work with them. But you can envisage circumstances in which the Labour party fundamentally changes and we could work with them. There is a dispiritingly small number of Tories who seem willing to stand up and be counted \u2013 we could work with them, and we have form in that area.\u201d Cable believes it is possible for the Lib Dems to become the largest party at the next election, which he expects to happen in the spring at the latest. He says his successor faces a \u201cmajor strategic choice\u201d over whether to continue the party\u2019s attempts to rebuild by narrowly targeting seats or to adopt a much more ambitious programme. \u201cThat\u2019s the big choice that the leader and party conference in September will have to make,\u201d he says. \u201cMy instincts are that we can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t abandon the targeting. This idea of working at the grassroots and really building up a local base is absolutely fundamental to our success, to the extent that we\u2019ve had it, and you can\u2019t walk away from that. But there is a potential upside that we\u2019ve got to imagine too.\u201d The next Lib Dem leader will be revealed this week, with Jo Swinson the favourite to defeat Ed Davey. However, several sources have indicated that votes received so far suggest a 50/50 split between the two candidates, meaning a surprise result is possible. Cable describes his experience as leader as \u201cmixed\u201d. He has been frustrated by some of the behind-the-scenes battles necessary to safeguard the party, which only months ago was fighting for its future before a major upturn in its electoral fortunes. However, he is happy to have met activists outside the \u201cWestminster bubble\u201d, something he describes as the top perk. He regrets being associated with an attempt to oust Nick Clegg as Lib Dem leader at the end of the coalition years (a \u201cpainful episode\u201d, he says, though insisting he was not directly involved), and also believes he would have done a \u201cgood job\u201d had he been able to run for leader in 2007. Had it been offered in the immediate aftermath of the referendum, he says he would have voted for a soft Brexit compromise. Now, he fears, there is no chance of such an agreement. The most likely outcome, in his view, is that Boris Johnson will slightly alter Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal, \u201cthe \u2018lipstick on a pig\u2019 kind of thing\u201d, and win enough votes. He is seriously concerned about the looming risk of a recession and how powerless governments and central banks could be should it arrive. Given the plaudits he won for his economic warnings ahead of the great financial crisis of 2007-08, those concerns are worth listening to. \u201cThere are quite a lot of red flashing lights,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a mug\u2019s game to say there is going to be a recession, but recession risk is certainly pretty high right now. I think we should be worried, very worried. \u201cWhat happened in the financial crisis was the economic equivalent of a heart attack. The patient was kept alive by having adrenaline pumped in through little wires. We\u2019re still attached to the life-support system. \u201cThat is what is so odd and also so dangerous about it \u2013 governments have used up the conventional monetary policy. Levels of government debt to the economy are still historically very high. So the scope for traditional anti-recession measures has already been significantly used up. There are things lurking in the background.\u201d",

Thurman looks gassed and hurt. A body shot then an uppercut by Pacquiao. High drama in the 10th.

The bounce that powered him to the early lead on the cards is gone. Thurman is coming forward and pressuring his opponent, finally getting the jab to click while working the body. Pacquiao is able to come off the ropes late in the frame to back up Thurman with a quick combination but it\u2019s not enough.

Then another. He\u2019s back on the balls of his feet and circling Thurman to find new angles of approach and keep his opponent guessing. Great in-out movement from the 40-year-old. Thurman is holding his ground, however. More sharp counters from the American. It\u2019s a close round \u2013 maybe the closest of the fight so far \u2013 and Thurman may have done enough with a flurry of punches in the last 10 seconds to nick it. </p> \n  <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Pacquiao 9-10 Thurman (Pacquiao 77-74 Thurman)</strong><br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d33ec948f0845f89e311485\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-21T04:40:07.336Z\">5.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Round 7</strong></p> \n  <p>Thurman slips a left hand by Pacquiao and comes back with a big counter right. Another good one-two combo by Thurman. Pacquiao snaps Thurman\u2019s head back with a massive uppercut, but Thurman responds with more effective combinations and deft counterpunching. Great work by Thurman from bell to bell and he\u2019s taken advantage in a drop in Pacquiao\u2019s pace to win back-to-back rounds and scratch his way back into the fight. </p> \n  <p><strong>Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Pacquiao 9-10 Thurman (Pacquiao 68-64 Thurman)</strong><br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d33eba78f0845f89e311483\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-21T04:36:03.182Z\">5.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Round 6</strong></p> \n  <p>Pacquiao continues to bust up Thurman, whose face tells the story. But Thurman contines to push forward. He backs up Pacquiao with a big right hand but Pacquiao takes the punch well, following up with blinding combinations of his own. The pace slows for the second half of the round and Pacquiao appears to be resting up a bit, enough to give Thurman the round. Thurman is doing his best work when he\u2019s boxing behind an active jab and keeps his foot on the gas.

This is a dead-even round with about 30 seconds to go, but Pacquiao lands a series of big shots in the final seconds \u2013 including a massive right hand that rocks Thurman \u2013 to take the round.

His activity is overwhelming Thurman, who\u2019s already looking a bit tired and gunshy, curling himself up in a tight guard.

Thurman lands a few good body shots then connects with a big right hand upstairs. A great inside uppercut by Pacquiao. Every time Thurman attempts to throw a jab, Pacquiao is right on top of it with a quick counter.

He\u2019s letting his hands go with combinations, many of which are being parried or blocked by Thurman but which may register with the judges. Thurman briefly turns southpaw but switches back. Pacquiao is landing a lot of power shots here. Pacquiao lands a big left hand upstairs in the final 10 seconds and dances his way to the corner after the bell. Thurman\u2019s body language as he makes the longer walk to his corner is not so good.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for now. Thanks as always for following along with us and be sure to check out the full report below. \u201cHe\u2019s a good boxer, he\u2019s strong,\u201d says Pacquiao, who becomes the oldest holder of a major welterweight title in boxing history. \u201cI was blessed tonight.\u201d The 40-year-old says he is planning on fighting again in 2020, possibly against the winner of the 28 September fight between Errol Spence Jr and Shawn Porter. Thurman, upbeat in defeat, calls Pacquiao \u201ctruly great\u201d as says he would love a rematch. \u201cI wish I had a little more output to go toe to toe with him,\u201d Thurman says. \u201cMy condition, my output was just behind Manny Pacquiao.\u201d Glenn Feldman scores it 114-113 to Thurman, while Dave Moretti and Tim Cheatham both had it 115-112 for Pacquiao. (The Guardian scored it 115-112 to Pacquiao.) Round 12 Pacquiao not taking any chances in the 12th, confident he\u2019s ahead on the scorecards. He\u2019s circling Thurman, picking away with punches but not pressing for a knockout. Thurman tries to come forward and throw punches, but he\u2019s absorbed too much punishment (especially to the body) and doesn\u2019t appear to have much left. Close round with 30 seconds to go. Pacquiao gets tagged by a right hook, but comes back with a cobination off the ropes that\u2019s enough to give him the round. Now the wait for the official scores ... Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Pacquiao 10-9 Thurman (Pacquiao 115-112 Thurman) Round 11 Thurman hurts Pacquiao with a hard right over the top early in the round then follows it up with an uppercut. Pacquiao is doing enough to keep the round competitive but Thurman is scoring with straight rights and jabs. Thurman takes the round but he will need a knockdown in the 12th to force a draw on our unofficial scorecard. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Pacquiao 9-10 Thurman (Pacquiao 105-103 Thurman) Round 10 Pacquiao needs a big round to halt Thurman\u2019s momentum and he\u2019s coming for it early! A devastating body shot by Pacquiao has Thurman hurt badly and the Filipino is rushing in for the finish! Looks like there was a head butt but referee Kenny Bayless does not intervene. Thurman looks gassed and hurt. A body shot then an uppercut by Pacquiao. High drama in the 10th. A big shift in momentum here with Pacquiao putting Thurman into full retreat. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Pacquiao 10-9 Thurman (Pacquiao 96-93 Thurman) Round 9 Thurman lands some big shots early in the ninth and Pacquiao, whose legs do not look great, is slowing down. The bounce that powered him to the early lead on the cards is gone. Thurman is coming forward and pressuring his opponent, finally getting the jab to click while working the body. Pacquiao is able to come off the ropes late in the frame to back up Thurman with a quick combination but it\u2019s not enough. This fight is getting very interesting. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Pacquiao 9-10 Thurman (Pacquiao 86-84 Thurman) Round 8 Pacquiao tattoos Thurman with a combination. Then another. He\u2019s back on the balls of his feet and circling Thurman to find new angles of approach and keep his opponent guessing. Great in-out movement from the 40-year-old. Thurman is holding his ground, however. More sharp counters from the American. It\u2019s a close round \u2013 maybe the closest of the fight so far \u2013 and Thurman may have done enough with a flurry of punches in the last 10 seconds to nick it. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Pacquiao 9-10 Thurman (Pacquiao 77-74 Thurman) Round 7 Thurman slips a left hand by Pacquiao and comes back with a big counter right. Another good one-two combo by Thurman. Pacquiao snaps Thurman\u2019s head back with a massive uppercut, but Thurman responds with more effective combinations and deft counterpunching. Great work by Thurman from bell to bell and he\u2019s taken advantage in a drop in Pacquiao\u2019s pace to win back-to-back rounds and scratch his way back into the fight. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Pacquiao 9-10 Thurman (Pacquiao 68-64 Thurman) Round 6 Pacquiao continues to bust up Thurman, whose face tells the story. But Thurman contines to push forward. He backs up Pacquiao with a big right hand but Pacquiao takes the punch well, following up with blinding combinations of his own. The pace slows for the second half of the round and Pacquiao appears to be resting up a bit, enough to give Thurman the round. Thurman is doing his best work when he\u2019s boxing behind an active jab and keeps his foot on the gas. More of that, please. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Pacquiao 9-10 Thurman (Pacquiao 59-54 Thurman) Round 5 Thurman catches Pacquiao with a right is starting to pour on the punches, pressing Pacquiao back against the ropes and not letting him off the hook like before. Another big right by Thurman, whose nose is now bleeding. Now Pacquiao hits back with a series of combinations to the body. This is a dead-even round with about 30 seconds to go, but Pacquiao lands a series of big shots in the final seconds \u2013 including a massive right hand that rocks Thurman \u2013 to take the round. Thurman is bleeding from the nose and mouth and looks unsteady as he walks back to the corner. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Pacquiao 10-9 Thurman (Pacquiao 50-44 Thurman) Round 4 Thurman is doing his best work of the fight early in the fourth, letting his hands go a bit and backing Pacquiao up. He gets Pacquiao up against the ropes but Pacquiao explodes towards the center with a flurry of punches. Pacquiao now throwing punches from all different angles. His activity is overwhelming Thurman, who\u2019s already looking a bit tired and gunshy, curling himself up in a tight guard. Pacquiao just too busy and creative for the younger champion. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Pacquiao 10-9 Thurman (Pacquiao 40-35 Thurman) Round 3 Pacquiao is moving great early in the third as Thurman continues to measure up the target in front of him. Pacquiao stings Thurman with a stiff jab, then follows up with combination. It\u2019s a vintage display of speed and power. Thurman lands a few good body shots then connects with a big right hand upstairs. A great inside uppercut by Pacquiao. Every time Thurman attempts to throw a jab, Pacquiao is right on top of it with a quick counter. A less busy round for both fighters but Pacquiao is in control. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Pacquiao 10-9 Thurman (Pacquiao 30-26 Thurman) Round 2 Thurman was not badly hurt by the flash knockdown but Pacquiao looking great to start the second round, flummoxing the American with his hand speed. He\u2019s letting his hands go with combinations, many of which are being parried or blocked by Thurman but which may register with the judges. Thurman briefly turns southpaw but switches back. Pacquiao is landing a lot of power shots here. Pacquiao lands a big left hand upstairs in the final 10 seconds and dances his way to the corner after the bell. Thurman\u2019s body language as he makes the longer walk to his corner is not so good. He looks out of his depth early on. Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Pacquiao 10-9 Thurman (Pacquiao 20-17 Thurman) Pacquiao comes out fast and throws a big right hook that misses. Thurman lands a straight lead right. Thurman standing his ground. Thurman lands a nice right-left combination. Another good right by Thurman and it\u2019s been a good start for the younger, primer fighter. They\u2019re trading punches in the corner. And a big right hook directly by Pacquiao on the chin has dropped Thurman with 20 seconds left in the round! He caught Thurman backing up with his hands down! They\u2019re going to war as the bell sounds. What an opening round! Guardian\u2019s unofficial score: Pacquiao 10-8 Thurman (Pacquiao 10-8 Thurman) The fighters have been announced by Jimmy Lennon Jr. They\u2019ve met at the center of the ring for the final instructions from referee Kenny Bayless. The seconds are out and the opening bell is moments away. We\u2019ll pick it up with round-by-round updates from here! And here come the fighters! First it\u2019s Thurman, who jogs from the tunnel to Archie Eversole\u2019s We Ready in a red, white and blue robe. He\u2019s playing to the fans and looks in good spirits. Then comes Pacquiao, all smiles as usual in a red robe with gold, white and blue trim to Survivor\u2019s Eye of the Tiger, one of his old standards. Now the national anthems of the Philippines and the United States. Big chant of \u201cMan-ny! Man-ny\u201d ring out from the sold-out crowd of 14,236. Yordenis Ugas has beaten Omar Figueroa Jr by a unanimous decision in the final undercard fight. All three ringside judges scored it 119-107 (as did the Guardian). A comprehensive beatdown that, frankly, should have been stopped by the referee before going the full distance. Ugas will likely angle for the winner of the fight between welterweight alpha dog Errol Spence Jr and Shawn Porter, which has been made for 28 September at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. Next up: Manny Pacquiao v Keith Thurman. The fighters will make their entrances any minute now. Pacquiao and Thurman are hitting the mitts in their dressing rooms waiting for the final undercard bout to finish up. Ugas and Figueroa are in the 10th round and it\u2019s been a one-sided affair from start to finish with Ugas in total command from the opening bell. The main event should be under way in about 20 minutes. Make what you may of this: Floyd Mayweather Jr has taken his seat at ringside at the MGM Grand ahead of tonight\u2019s main event. Has it really been four years since he and Pacquiao met in this very room in a superfight that shattered all revenue records? Rumblings of a rematch that no one is particularly interested in seeing but which would generate boatloads of cash have persisted in the years since, even in the last year. It makes you think. What a difference two years makes. Back in 2017, Thurman was on the fringe of the pound-for-pound conversation after unifying welterweight titles against Danny Garcia, while Pacquiao appeared on his way out of the sport after a shock defeat to the unheralded Jeff Horn. Since then Thurman was sidelined 22 months, first by right elbow surgery and then an injured left hand, and was hurt badly by a B-level opponent in a January comeback fight, while Pacquiao has rolled back the years in back-to-back victories over Lucas Matthysse and Adrien Broner. Consequently, Pacquiao enters tonight\u2019s fight as a slight betting favorite, though we\u2019ve just heard the MGM has taken a six-figure wager on Thurman in the last few hours. \u201cIt\u2019s been a build up and a progression my whole career toward this moment on Saturday night,\u201d Thurman said this week. \u201cThis really is the outcome of an individual living out their dream.\u201d Hello and welcome to the MGM Grand for tonight\u2019s WBA welterweight title fight between Manny Pacquiao and Keith Thurman. It\u2019s a main event offering an intriguing matchup between the 40-year-old Pacquiao (61-7-2, 39 KOs), an eight-division champion in the winter of an all-time great career, and the 30-year-old Thurman (29-0, 22 KOs), one of the sport\u2019s young lions with an opportunity to secure the signature win of his career.

The co-main event, a 12-round welterweight scrap between Omar Figueroa Jr vs Yordenis Ugas, is about to start. Which means Pacquiao and Thurman should make their ringwalks in about 45 minutes.

The hit is the New York Strip, a seared sirloin steak served the right side of both pink and Old Testament bible thick. It comes with a creamy peppercorn sauce which appears to have been completely blitzed. There are no peppercorns. Instead there is a massive hit of white pepper. It\u2019s astringent and weirdly compelling. Unlike the cauliflower risotto, which is a salty, acrid mess of failed vegetal matter.

Recently it was forced to leave its home of 40 years after a group led by Robert De Niro announced plans to turn the building into a hotel. The hotel fell through but Joe\u2019s had already moved, taking the original wooden bar with it. And it still does the thing. It serves one of the best Caesar salads in London, the burger remains off menu and it understands pecan pie (<em><a href=\"https://www.joeallen.co.uk/\">joeallen.co.uk</a></em>).</p> <p>The gloriously funny George Egg is returning to the Edinburgh fringe this summer, with a new show about the joys of makeshift cookery. After demonstrating how to make dinner in a hotel room with only a kettle and a Corby trouser press, Movable Feast is about cooking on trains, planes and automobiles (<em><a href=\"http://anarchistcook.info/\">anarchistcook.info</a></em>).</p> <p>All change in the hotel business. At Brown\u2019s in London, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/may/20/heinz-beck-london-everything-is-overengineered-restaurant-review\">poorly reviewed</a> Heinz Beck is out and Adam Byatt of Trinity in Clapham is in. Meanwhile in the Lake District, Simon Rogan, who has closed Fera at Claridge\u2019s in London, is opening Henrock at Linthwaite House on Lake Windermere.</p> <p><em>Jay Rayner will be appearing in a special Guardian Live event at London\u2019s Cadogan Hall on 9 September.

Some of the food does the thing, and while the dear staff might not quite be getting the direction they need, they meant well. Yeah, I know. These really are the excuses we make for a much-loved friend, whom we know is a car crash. Oh come on Martha; please just sort yourself out. You have it in you to be very special. News bites For a reliable slice of New York try Joe Allen, just off London\u2019s Strand. Recently it was forced to leave its home of 40 years after a group led by Robert De Niro announced plans to turn the building into a hotel. The hotel fell through but Joe\u2019s had already moved, taking the original wooden bar with it. And it still does the thing. It serves one of the best Caesar salads in London, the burger remains off menu and it understands pecan pie (joeallen.co.uk). The gloriously funny George Egg is returning to the Edinburgh fringe this summer, with a new show about the joys of makeshift cookery. After demonstrating how to make dinner in a hotel room with only a kettle and a Corby trouser press, Movable Feast is about cooking on trains, planes and automobiles (anarchistcook.info). All change in the hotel business. At Brown\u2019s in London, the poorly reviewed Heinz Beck is out and Adam Byatt of Trinity in Clapham is in. Meanwhile in the Lake District, Simon Rogan, who has closed Fera at Claridge\u2019s in London, is opening Henrock at Linthwaite House on Lake Windermere. Jay Rayner will be appearing in a special Guardian Live event at London\u2019s Cadogan Hall on 9 September. In My Last Supper, the show accompanying his soon-to-be-published book of the same name, Jay examines our fascination with last meals and tells the story of his own. Click here for tickets.

Some organizations, like <a href=\"https://www.raicestexas.org/donate/families-together-fund/\">Raices</a> in Texas, organize general bail funds, not one-on-one payouts. But the case for it has been building as the scale of the problem has grown, and the United States has come in for mounting criticism under international law, which says detaining immigrants should be a <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/07/1041991\">last resort</a>, not standard operating procedure.</p> <p>Twenty-three years after the Clinton administration <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/other/analysis-immigration-detention-policies?redirect=immigrants-rights/analysis-immigration-detention-policies\">systematized</a> mandatory detention of migrants known or suspected to have a criminal history, more than 50,000 are now behind bars. The number has <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/hamedaleaziz/ice-detention-record-immigrants-border\">increased dramatically</a> since Trump entered the Oval Office, as a growing number of ordinary asylum seekers and others crossing the border without papers have been thrown in along with those being assessed as possible threats to public safety.</p> <p>Still, bailing out individuals seems likely to become more of a thing now, to the delight of overworked immigration lawyers who typically spend weeks or months trying to line up sponsors they hope can raise, scrimp or borrow thousands of dollars to get their clients out of custody.</p> <p>\u201cThis is huge. It\u2019s amazing. It changes everything,\u201d said Mona Iman, an attorney with Immigrant Defenders. Iman couldn\u2019t previously imagine how to raise the $7,500 demanded by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) to bail out Carlos, an 18-year-old client who fled gang violence and an abusive household in Honduras only to spend 17 months in a variety of youth shelters and tough adult detention facilities. (At the request of Immigrant Defenders, the Guardian is withholding his last name.)</p> <p>She was told that $7,500 was more than any nonprofit or family fundraising effort could come up with. Then she learned that four admirers of Sharron\u2019s had agreed to pool the money, and one of them, a computer technician and occasional actor named Dean Jacobson, was willing to make the same trek to the DHS building in downtown Los Angeles and sit for hours in a crowded seventh-floor waiting room as the bureaucrats checked all their boxes. \u201cAs soon as I saw Julie\u2019s post, I knew I needed to do something,\u201d Jacobson explained.</p> <p>At the beginning of this week, as Trump urged four congresswomen of color to \u201cgo back\u201d to the countries they came from, Jacobson joined the security line outside the offices of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) at 6.30am and reached the bail counter in room 7621 as it opened an hour later. Within 45 minutes all the seats in the office were full and a line of anxious friends and family members of detainees was snaking down the windowless corridor. Jacobson had spent little time in government offices and soon became exercised that DHS could not provide so much as a bench for the overflow.</p> <p>An hour went by, then two, then three. The authorities in Adelanto needed to sign off on the bond, he was told, and it was not uncommon for them to take their sweet time. After six hours he was informed, abruptly, that the bond had been canceled. He was not given a coherent reason.</p> <p>It was the moment when liberal idealism smacked into the wall of an immigration system that is often slow, inconsistent in its decision-making and lacking in transparency. \u201cSupremely unjust\u201d was how Iman described it.</p> <p>After trying and failing to obtain an explanation for the canceled bond, Iman focused her energies instead on a hearing before Carlos\u2019s immigration judge, who has a daunting track record of turning down <a href=\"https://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/judgereports/00352LOS/index.html\">more than 90%</a> of asylum requests brought before her.</p> <p>Still, Iman saw a glimmer of hope, because the judge had previously expressed some sympathy for Carlos, who arrived in the United States as a minor and was moved around so much \u2013 from state to state as well as from institution to institution \u2013 that for a long time he couldn\u2019t work consistently with a lawyer to win release under a number of available programs designed to help children fleeing abuse or violence. On the day Carlos turned 18 in March, he was slapped in handcuffs and put in an adult detention center akin to high-security prison, even though he had no criminal record and Iman had arranged a release plan that should have precluded such a move. He was transferred twice more before landing in Adelanto.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"69510243da0158fa289be1ad98c406263ca0ed6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69510243da0158fa289be1ad98c406263ca0ed6f/0_0_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An immigrant detainee reads through paperwork at the Adelanto detention facility on 15 November 2013 in Adelanto, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An immigrant detainee reads through paperwork at the Adelanto detention facility on 15 November 2013 in Adelanto, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Moore/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The lawyer representing the government at the immigration hearing agreed in advance that Carlos deserved to be bailed out, for $3,000 instead of $7,500. Still, Iman was wary of her chances because the judge, Tara Naselow-Nahas, did not typically accept agreements made by lawyers appearing before her.</p> <p>Jacobson turned up at the hearing, along with another donor to the bond fund, Carlos\u2019s sponsor \u2013 a Salvadoran American who had herself fled violence to come to the United States 30 years ago \u2013 and other supporters. Carlos himself appeared by video link from Adelanto, wearing blue prison clothes.</p> <p>Judge Naselow-Nahas soon agreed to set bail at $3,000, as the lawyers requested. She gave no hint that the decision was an unusual one for her.</p> <p>As the hearing ended, Iman wiped away a tear. Nobody dared raise their voice until they were all in an elevator, out of earshot of any DHS official, and raised an enthusiastic cheer. Jacobson announced he was going to the bank right away to obtain a new, smaller cashier\u2019s check and would be back at DHS first thing the next morning. (The second time was the charm, and Carlos was released on Thursday evening.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/12/tucson-arizona-migrant-compassion-border-crisis\">Arizona city fights to spread compassion for migrants amid border crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The lesson, Sharron says, is that large numbers of people want to push back against what they see as horrifying policy decisions by the Trump administration but need guidance to point them in the right direction. \u201cPeople in general want to do good,\u201d she said, \u201cbut most of the time think nothing they can do can make a difference or they don\u2019t know how to make a difference.

And she decided she\u2019d use the money to bail out an asylum seeker. \u201cIs this a thing?\u201d she asked her friend Casey Revkin, who runs a volunteer organization, Immigrant Families Together, dedicated to providing food, clothing, airline tickets and other necessities to migrants as they come out of detention. \u201cI need to know I got one person out.\u201d Revkin hadn\u2019t heard of any individuals bailing immigrants out, but she put Sharron in touch with the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, which represents migrant detainees pro bono. Within days, Sharron was handing over a cashier\u2019s check at the Department of Homeland Security office in downtown Los Angeles to secure the release of a 28-year-old mother from Cuba who otherwise would have been stuck in Adelanto, a private detention center in the high Mojave desert notorious for its poor conditions. Even more consequentially, Sharron wrote up her experiences in a Facebook post that went viral \u2013 within days, it was seen by 3,000 people \u2013 and inspired more than a dozen others to follow her lead and offer bond money of their own. They include film and television actors, Ilyse Hogue, the women\u2019s rights campaigner who is president of Naral Pro-Choice America, and many less prominent social activists who know Sharron from her work campaigning for better public schools, or from the comic book shop she runs in Silver Lake, or simply from her social media posts. \u201cI was so inspired by Julie \u2013 by the notion of helping out an individual or an individual family in need,\u201d said Casey Wilson, a film actor and Saturday Night Live alum who had been raising money to send toys and art supplies to child migrants in detention but immediately recognized the power of Sharron\u2019s idea and redirected some of the contributions accordingly. As far as anyone can tell, bailing out a stranger in the immigration system was not a \u201cthing\u201d until Sharron shone a spotlight on it. Some organizations, like Raices in Texas, organize general bail funds, not one-on-one payouts. But the case for it has been building as the scale of the problem has grown, and the United States has come in for mounting criticism under international law, which says detaining immigrants should be a last resort, not standard operating procedure. Twenty-three years after the Clinton administration systematized mandatory detention of migrants known or suspected to have a criminal history, more than 50,000 are now behind bars. The number has increased dramatically since Trump entered the Oval Office, as a growing number of ordinary asylum seekers and others crossing the border without papers have been thrown in along with those being assessed as possible threats to public safety. Still, bailing out individuals seems likely to become more of a thing now, to the delight of overworked immigration lawyers who typically spend weeks or months trying to line up sponsors they hope can raise, scrimp or borrow thousands of dollars to get their clients out of custody. \u201cThis is huge. It\u2019s amazing. It changes everything,\u201d said Mona Iman, an attorney with Immigrant Defenders. Iman couldn\u2019t previously imagine how to raise the $7,500 demanded by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) to bail out Carlos, an 18-year-old client who fled gang violence and an abusive household in Honduras only to spend 17 months in a variety of youth shelters and tough adult detention facilities. (At the request of Immigrant Defenders, the Guardian is withholding his last name.) She was told that $7,500 was more than any nonprofit or family fundraising effort could come up with. Then she learned that four admirers of Sharron\u2019s had agreed to pool the money, and one of them, a computer technician and occasional actor named Dean Jacobson, was willing to make the same trek to the DHS building in downtown Los Angeles and sit for hours in a crowded seventh-floor waiting room as the bureaucrats checked all their boxes. \u201cAs soon as I saw Julie\u2019s post, I knew I needed to do something,\u201d Jacobson explained. At the beginning of this week, as Trump urged four congresswomen of color to \u201cgo back\u201d to the countries they came from, Jacobson joined the security line outside the offices of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) at 6.30am and reached the bail counter in room 7621 as it opened an hour later. Within 45 minutes all the seats in the office were full and a line of anxious friends and family members of detainees was snaking down the windowless corridor. Jacobson had spent little time in government offices and soon became exercised that DHS could not provide so much as a bench for the overflow. An hour went by, then two, then three. The authorities in Adelanto needed to sign off on the bond, he was told, and it was not uncommon for them to take their sweet time. After six hours he was informed, abruptly, that the bond had been canceled. He was not given a coherent reason. It was the moment when liberal idealism smacked into the wall of an immigration system that is often slow, inconsistent in its decision-making and lacking in transparency. \u201cSupremely unjust\u201d was how Iman described it. After trying and failing to obtain an explanation for the canceled bond, Iman focused her energies instead on a hearing before Carlos\u2019s immigration judge, who has a daunting track record of turning down more than 90% of asylum requests brought before her. Still, Iman saw a glimmer of hope, because the judge had previously expressed some sympathy for Carlos, who arrived in the United States as a minor and was moved around so much \u2013 from state to state as well as from institution to institution \u2013 that for a long time he couldn\u2019t work consistently with a lawyer to win release under a number of available programs designed to help children fleeing abuse or violence. On the day Carlos turned 18 in March, he was slapped in handcuffs and put in an adult detention center akin to high-security prison, even though he had no criminal record and Iman had arranged a release plan that should have precluded such a move. He was transferred twice more before landing in Adelanto. The lawyer representing the government at the immigration hearing agreed in advance that Carlos deserved to be bailed out, for $3,000 instead of $7,500. Still, Iman was wary of her chances because the judge, Tara Naselow-Nahas, did not typically accept agreements made by lawyers appearing before her. Jacobson turned up at the hearing, along with another donor to the bond fund, Carlos\u2019s sponsor \u2013 a Salvadoran American who had herself fled violence to come to the United States 30 years ago \u2013 and other supporters. Carlos himself appeared by video link from Adelanto, wearing blue prison clothes. Judge Naselow-Nahas soon agreed to set bail at $3,000, as the lawyers requested. She gave no hint that the decision was an unusual one for her. As the hearing ended, Iman wiped away a tear. Nobody dared raise their voice until they were all in an elevator, out of earshot of any DHS official, and raised an enthusiastic cheer. Jacobson announced he was going to the bank right away to obtain a new, smaller cashier\u2019s check and would be back at DHS first thing the next morning. (The second time was the charm, and Carlos was released on Thursday evening.) The lesson, Sharron says, is that large numbers of people want to push back against what they see as horrifying policy decisions by the Trump administration but need guidance to point them in the right direction. \u201cPeople in general want to do good,\u201d she said, \u201cbut most of the time think nothing they can do can make a difference or they don\u2019t know how to make a difference. Giving people a little knowledge and power changes everything. \u201cIt\u2019s a vocal minority making these negative policies. And it\u2019s going to be everyday people that make things right again.\u201d Elizabeth Vitanza, a French teacher who was the other donor to Carlos\u2019s bail fund at the hearing, concurred. \u201cMoney is a thing I have. Time is a thing I have. I just paired that with compassion and empathy for human beings,\u201d she said. \u201cCarlos could be my student. The fact that he ended up at Adelanto is insane to me.\u201d Carlos\u2019s donor group quickly agreed that their unspent $4,500 should go toward bailing out another migrant, and Iman said she had a candidate in mind, another Cuban woman stuck in Adelanto who wanted to reach her relatives in Miami and be able to talk to her young children back in Cuba. The group immediately responded: \u201cCount us in.\u201d",

There isn\u2019t a lot here that hasn\u2019t been reported before, but Reid does a fine job of summarizing all the factors in the perfect storm that brought us a Trump presidency.</p> <p>Among things that helped to defeat Hillary Clinton, she identifies \u201caggressive, full-throttle voter suppression deployed\u201d by Republicans in Georgia, Wisconsin, Ohio and Texas, an effort which \u201ctook full advantage of the supreme court\u2019s gutting of the Voting Rights Act\u201d.</p> <p>There is also the \u201cpolitical press\u2019s fixation on Clinton\u2019s use of a private e-mail sever, and the FBI investigation it spawned\u201d, which \u201cconsumed the coverage, even as the media \u2026 lapped up \u2018The Trump Show\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>And there is the \u201cbarely disguised sexism that crosses ethnic, cultural and even gender lines to punish women who vie for power.\u201d</p> <p>Reid is good on specifics about states where voting lists have been ravaged by Republicans. Wisconsin voter ID laws which \u201cstripped some 300,000 mostly minority voters of their right to vote\u201d in 2016 helped Trump win in November by 22,748 votes.

The purpose of the Bush and Trump tax cuts \u201cis to destroy government, to downsize it to such a point where we have virtual anarchy\u201d.</p> <p>Bartlett adds: \u201cAlthough all Republicans are not racist, virtually all racists are Republicans.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrump talked like a populist but presided over massive tax cuts for the super rich,\u201d Reid writes, \u201cand a no-look government that unleashed an American oligarchy to do as it pleased.\u201d</p> <p>Trump is the president \u201cbrought to you by Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, Laura Ingraham and Fox News\u201d.

As Reid writes, \u201cthe rich in both countries control approximately equal shares of the wealth and income.

Instead of writing off the 40% which still seems to be mesmerized by his racist theater, Wise has a better idea.

      "bodyText": "How did we get Donald Trump? And how will we ever \u201cundo the damage he has done\u201d? These are the two questions Joy-Ann Reid focuses on in her new book, with much more about the former than the latter. There isn\u2019t a lot here that hasn\u2019t been reported before, but Reid does a fine job of summarizing all the factors in the perfect storm that brought us a Trump presidency. Among things that helped to defeat Hillary Clinton, she identifies \u201caggressive, full-throttle voter suppression deployed\u201d by Republicans in Georgia, Wisconsin, Ohio and Texas, an effort which \u201ctook full advantage of the supreme court\u2019s gutting of the Voting Rights Act\u201d. There is also the \u201cpolitical press\u2019s fixation on Clinton\u2019s use of a private e-mail sever, and the FBI investigation it spawned\u201d, which \u201cconsumed the coverage, even as the media \u2026 lapped up \u2018The Trump Show\u2019.\u201d And there is the \u201cbarely disguised sexism that crosses ethnic, cultural and even gender lines to punish women who vie for power.\u201d Reid is good on specifics about states where voting lists have been ravaged by Republicans. Wisconsin voter ID laws which \u201cstripped some 300,000 mostly minority voters of their right to vote\u201d in 2016 helped Trump win in November by 22,748 votes. In North Dakota, Native Americans are disenfranchised \u201cen masse\u201d by a state law requiring them to show IDs with \u201cspecific street addresses on them, even though many lived on reservations, where street addresses weren\u2019t used\u201d. After Trump\u2019s most recent transgressions, much of what Reid has written is especially relevant, including her description of \u201csome of the most open appeals to racial fear the country had seen in the modern political era\u201d. Noam Chomsky, one of America\u2019s last public intellectuals, memorably described the Republican party as \u201cthe most dangerous organization in human history\u201d, because of its single-minded commitment \u201cto the destruction of organized human life on Earth\u201d. In Reid\u2019s book, Republican apostate Bruce Bartlett says the party is dominated by anarchists who stand for nothing except slashing taxes on the rich and gutting benefits for the poor. The purpose of the Bush and Trump tax cuts \u201cis to destroy government, to downsize it to such a point where we have virtual anarchy\u201d. Bartlett adds: \u201cAlthough all Republicans are not racist, virtually all racists are Republicans.\u201d \u201cTrump talked like a populist but presided over massive tax cuts for the super rich,\u201d Reid writes, \u201cand a no-look government that unleashed an American oligarchy to do as it pleased.\u201d Trump is the president \u201cbrought to you by Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, Laura Ingraham and Fox News\u201d. He has normalized \u201ccorruption, cronyism, kleptocracy and the public display of of thuggery and open racism by white Americans who felt empowered to assert themselves as the arbiters of cultural legitimacy\u201d. And to the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and evangelical Christians, all of this \u201cwas worth it\u201d because the only thing they really care about is the transformation of \u201cthe judiciary for a generation\u201d. Of course, Trump\u2019s policies have also accelerated income inequality, which is now so extreme that it has made America comparable to Russia. As Reid writes, \u201cthe rich in both countries control approximately equal shares of the wealth and income. America, in a very real sense, has its own oligarchs.\u201d That agenda is the only one with which Republicans in Congress are genuinely concerned. Reid doesn\u2019t have many original observations but as a successful television anchor she knows who to interview to find real wisdom. Some of the most interesting ideas come from Tim Wise, an anti-racism activist and the author of White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son. He thinks the 2016 election might have had a different outcome if Clinton hadn\u2019t called Trump\u2019s supporters \u201cdeplorables\u201d. If, Wise writes, the Democrat had said instead, \u201c\u2018Donald Trump thinks his voters are so racist that they will fall for this phony scapegoating of black people and Mexican immigrants, but I know the people in this country are too smart to fall for that,\u2019 she might have found a way into a conversation with white voters who were not yet deeply entrenched against her.\u201d How do we undo the damage Trump has done? Instead of writing off the 40% which still seems to be mesmerized by his racist theater, Wise has a better idea. He believes that when most people are confronted with their subconscious biases, if they are \u201cencouraged to respond to the better angels of their nature, they will do it. \u201cIt\u2019s when you don\u2019t let them believe that they have better angels; if you make it seem like, \u2018You\u2019re just a horrible, irredeemable human being,\u2019 they will show you just how horrible and irredeemable they are. The research tells us \u2026 that most white folks don\u2019t want to think of themselves as racist, and don\u2019t want to be racist.\u201d That bit of optimism about the malleability of the president\u2019s supporters is just about the only hopeful thing in this book, a relentlessly depressing compendium of the horrors of the age of Trump.",

      "body": "<p>On Wednesday, a new prime minister will move into Downing Street. He will assume office at a time of burgeoning crisis. While the political system remains gridlocked over Brexit, the west\u2019s deteriorating relations with Iran are fraught with the risk of global conflict. No prime minister has faced as challenging a set of circumstances since the Second World War. And the man who looks almost certain to be making his entrance through that famous door is Boris Johnson.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to think of a senior Conservative MP less qualified to assume the premiership in such times. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2019/jul/20/iran-releases-footage-of-seized-british-flagged-oil-tanker-video\" title=\"\">clash with Iran</a> highlights the wider dilemma Britain will face after Brexit. Isolated from our European allies, the danger is that we simply become a lesser satellite of American foreign policy, buffeted by global events and too weak to resist the pressure to do the bidding of Donald Trump.</p> <p>And Johnson has a dreadful record as foreign secretary. He is best known for jeopardising the case of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe\" title=\"\">Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe</a>, the British-Iranian woman who has spent more than three years in a jail in Tehran, by erroneously stating that she had been \u201cteaching people journalism\u201d, later cited as proof by Iran that she was engaged in \u201cpropaganda against the regime\u201d. It was a foolish misstep by someone who has demonstrated time and again that he has little capacity for paying attention to detail. His time at the Foreign Office was riddled with diplomatic gaffes, from reading a colonial-era <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/30/boris-johnson-caught-on-camera-reciting-kipling-in-myanmar-temple\" title=\"\">Rudyard Kipling poem</a> during a state visit to Myanmar to likening the challenge of the Irish border after Brexit to the London congestion charge, to saying the war-torn Libyan city of Sirte only had to \u201cclear the dead bodies away\u201d to become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/oct/04/no-10-rebukes-boris-johnson-over-sirte-dead-bodies-comment\" title=\"\">the next Dubai</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just the gaffes. Johnson has a casual disregard for the truth where it stands in the way of his career, or a good pun. Last week was no exception, when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/18/boris-johnson-claims-about-kippers-fishy-brussels-says\" title=\"\">brandished a smoked kipper</a> from the Isle of Man at the final hustings of the Conservative leadership contest, and announced that its producer was \u201cutterly furious\u201d at the Brussels regulations that meant he now had to send his goods packed with ice. \u201cWe will bring the kippers back,\u201d Johnson told the cheering crowd.

      "bodyText": "On Wednesday, a new prime minister will move into Downing Street. He will assume office at a time of burgeoning crisis. While the political system remains gridlocked over Brexit, the west\u2019s deteriorating relations with Iran are fraught with the risk of global conflict. No prime minister has faced as challenging a set of circumstances since the Second World War. And the man who looks almost certain to be making his entrance through that famous door is Boris Johnson. It\u2019s hard to think of a senior Conservative MP less qualified to assume the premiership in such times. The clash with Iran highlights the wider dilemma Britain will face after Brexit. Isolated from our European allies, the danger is that we simply become a lesser satellite of American foreign policy, buffeted by global events and too weak to resist the pressure to do the bidding of Donald Trump. And Johnson has a dreadful record as foreign secretary. He is best known for jeopardising the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman who has spent more than three years in a jail in Tehran, by erroneously stating that she had been \u201cteaching people journalism\u201d, later cited as proof by Iran that she was engaged in \u201cpropaganda against the regime\u201d. It was a foolish misstep by someone who has demonstrated time and again that he has little capacity for paying attention to detail. His time at the Foreign Office was riddled with diplomatic gaffes, from reading a colonial-era Rudyard Kipling poem during a state visit to Myanmar to likening the challenge of the Irish border after Brexit to the London congestion charge, to saying the war-torn Libyan city of Sirte only had to \u201cclear the dead bodies away\u201d to become the next Dubai. It\u2019s not just the gaffes. Johnson has a casual disregard for the truth where it stands in the way of his career, or a good pun. Last week was no exception, when he brandished a smoked kipper from the Isle of Man at the final hustings of the Conservative leadership contest, and announced that its producer was \u201cutterly furious\u201d at the Brussels regulations that meant he now had to send his goods packed with ice. \u201cWe will bring the kippers back,\u201d Johnson told the cheering crowd. Little matter that these rules were set by Britain, not the EU. This is only the latest in a long line of occasions where Johnson has played fast and loose with the truth. Last month, he erroneously claimed that if Britain crashed out of the EU without a deal, we could avoid paying any tariffs on European imports. Rather than correct himself, he has doubled down \u2013 despite the fact that the independent Office for Budget Responsibility last week published its forecast that a no-deal Brexit would shrink the economy by 2% in 2020. That should not come as a surprise: Johnson has form when it comes to wilfully misleading the public. His 2016 claim that leaving the EU would free up \u00a3350m a week for the NHS led to the head of Britain\u2019s statistics watchdog chastising him for \u201ca clear misuse of official statistics\u201d. During the referendum campaign he claimed Turkey was on the verge of joining the EU, despite the fact its application had stalled, but this year claimed to have said nothing about Turkey during the campaign. How can this man be trusted to lead Britain in the wake of a catastrophic no deal? For after six weeks of a dismal Tory leadership contest, that looks to be where Britain could be heading. In the run-up to the 2016 referendum, neither of the Leave campaigns mooted Britain crashing out of Europe without a deal \u2013 it would have been inconceivable.

Some analysts suggest he has at least in part been seeking to exploit divisions among Democrats. But the party has stood together. Mara Glubka, a politically active fifth-district resident, told the Guardian she showed up to the airport on Thursday because she and other constituents felt compelled to \u201cdefend\u201d their representative. \u201cIt felt really good,\u201d she said of witnessing \u201clove and enthusiasm\u201d for Omar. Glubka, who is trans, said the congresswoman has been strong on LGBTQ issues, fulfilling promises made to constituents. Trump\u2019s attacks have only appeared strengthened her support. \u201cI\u2019m proud of Ilhan Omar,\u201d Glubka said. \u201cIf there\u2019s any \u2018sending back\u2019 that\u2019s gonna happen, it\u2019s gonna be sending her back to the United States Congress.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "On Wednesday afternoon, as 100,000 Puerto Ricans lined the grounds of the capitol, crowds surged in anticipation, snapping thin reels of yellow string designed to separate them from a makeshift speakers\u2019 platform. Some screamed with excitement. Others continued the chant that has led these week-long demonstrations against the island\u2019s governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3: \u201cRicky, resign!\u201d The rally\u2019s unofficial figureheads had arrived, winding through the crowd and clambering on to a white truck on which a speaker was mounted. They were not politicians, trade unionists or survivors of the liberation movement. They were young Puerto Rican musicians and artists, some famous across the globe, and they were in San Juan to lead one of the largest protests in the island\u2019s history. Last weekend, the scandal-ridden Rossell\u00f3 administration appeared to reach the end of its credibility after hundreds of pages of leaked text messages between the governor and 11 members of his inner circle revealed homophobic and misogynistic comments directed at political rivals and cultural figures, as well as messages mocking those who died during Hurricane Maria in 2017. The scandal marks the low point of almost two years of corruption and mismanagement which has recently seen former members of the administration arrested by the FBI. It comes against a backdrop of sweeping austerity and privatisation imposed after Maria, as the island grapples with a decades-old debt crisis. Shortly before Wednesday\u2019s rally three young Puerto Rican musicians \u2013 the reggaeton star Benito Martinez Ocasio, known by his stage name Bad Bunny, and two Grammy winners, rapper Residente and singer Ileana Cabra Joglar, known as iLe, released a quickly composed protest track that has been played more than 3.5 million times on YouTube, a number larger than the population of the island itself. Afilando Los Cuchillos, or Sharpening The Knives, is a blistering attack on the governor\u2019s record. \u201cYour apologies are drowned with rain water/ In houses that still don\u2019t have a roof,\u201d Residente raps in Spanish, aimed at Rossell\u00f3\u2019s tepid apology for the messages, and a reference to homes on the island that have not been repaired since the hurricane. \u201cWe are cutting like knives/ Sparkling up to the edge,\u201d iLe sings, meaning cutting through the island\u2019s corruption. All three stood on a large speaker at Wednesday\u2019s rally, surveying the thousands assembled around them. \u201cIt was amazing to see,\u201d iLe told the Guardian, at a nondescript recording studio in a San Juan suburb. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for so long for a massive awakening in Puerto Rico and I think we\u2019re doing that right now and it feels incredible.\u201d Her voice was a little hoarse after hours chanting and singing with protesters the previous day.

So what is it about this moment, and this particular scandal, that has inspired such a broad and diverse coalition of protest? \u201cOur history has been based on humiliation and abuse and we\u2019ve got used to it,\u201d said iLe. \u201cWe trust too much in the government as a majority.

He cares about America.\u201d</p> \n<p>Smith lives just outside Charlottesville, Virginia, a city that knows the consequences of the president\u2019s race-baiting better than any other. It was here, nearly two years ago, that a march by white supremacists and Ku Klux Klan members brandishing shields, clubs and guns, ostensibly to defend a statue of Confederate general Robert E Lee, led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/12/virginia-unite-the-right-rally-protest-violence\">violent clashes</a> and the death of counter-protester Heather Heyer.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s claim that there had been \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d was a comment that will live in infamy. This week he did it again, tweeting that progressive congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib should \u201cgo back\u201d to their countries. Then, at a rally on Wednesday night, Trump again tore into Omar, a US citizen born in Somalia, and remained silent for 13 chilling seconds <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/17/trump-rally-send-her-back-ilhan-omar\">as the crowd chanted:</a> \u201cSend her back! Send her back!\u201d</p> \n<p>It was a clarifying moment about the two faces of America in 2019. One is that of a 73-year-old white man spewing nativist bigotry and raging against change. The other is that of a 37-year-old hijab-wearing Muslim woman, a refugee from Africa turned congresswoman greeted with cries of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/19/ilhan-omar-trump-attacks-minnesota-support\">Welcome home, Ilhan!</a>\u201d on her return to Minnesota.</p> \n<p>To many this feels like a pivot point in history. In the New Yorker, Susan Glasser <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/im-winning-donald-trumps-calculated-racism\">wrote of Trump:</a> \u201cHalf of the country is appalled but not really sure how to combat him; the other half is cheering, or at least averting its gaze. This is what a political civil war looks like, with words, for now, as weapons.\u201d</p> \n<p>Smith, a financial consultant, knows which side he is on.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>He's making those four the face of the Democratic party and the party is not distancing itself from them</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Clark Smith</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cTrump\u2019s for all America and these four women hate America,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to change America into something I don\u2019t recognise.

They say we have a racist country , but I think there is very little broken in America right now.\u201d</p> \n<p>Intentionally or not, Trump\u2019s embrace of white identity politics <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/15/trump-twitter-aoc-racist-rant-congress\">may work to his advantage</a> next year. Only four House Republicans voted for a resolution to condemn his remarks. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-poll/republican-support-for-trump-rises-after-racially-charged-tweets-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKCN1UB2UD\">A Reuters/Ipsos poll</a> showed his net approval among Republicans rose by five points to 72%.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a brilliant strategy,\u201d said Smith, who intends to vote for Trump again. \u201cHe is making those four the face of the Democratic party and the party is not distancing itself from them.

      "bodyText": "If Donald Trump\u2019s racist diatribe against four congresswomen of colour was intended to animate his most loyal supporters, it seemed to have worked with Clark Smith. \u201cMr Trump didn\u2019t say anything all,\u201d the 58-year-old said. \u201cHe\u2019s an extremely un-racist person and I sincerely mean that. He\u2019s not stoking any racial resentment. The Democrats are. They are all about identity politics. Mr Trump doesn\u2019t care about race, he doesn\u2019t care about religion. He cares about America.\u201d Smith lives just outside Charlottesville, Virginia, a city that knows the consequences of the president\u2019s race-baiting better than any other. It was here, nearly two years ago, that a march by white supremacists and Ku Klux Klan members brandishing shields, clubs and guns, ostensibly to defend a statue of Confederate general Robert E Lee, led to violent clashes and the death of counter-protester Heather Heyer. Trump\u2019s claim that there had been \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d was a comment that will live in infamy. This week he did it again, tweeting that progressive congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib should \u201cgo back\u201d to their countries. Then, at a rally on Wednesday night, Trump again tore into Omar, a US citizen born in Somalia, and remained silent for 13 chilling seconds as the crowd chanted: \u201cSend her back! Send her back!\u201d It was a clarifying moment about the two faces of America in 2019. One is that of a 73-year-old white man spewing nativist bigotry and raging against change. The other is that of a 37-year-old hijab-wearing Muslim woman, a refugee from Africa turned congresswoman greeted with cries of \u201cWelcome home, Ilhan!\u201d on her return to Minnesota. To many this feels like a pivot point in history. In the New Yorker, Susan Glasser wrote of Trump: \u201cHalf of the country is appalled but not really sure how to combat him; the other half is cheering, or at least averting its gaze. This is what a political civil war looks like, with words, for now, as weapons.\u201d Smith, a financial consultant, knows which side he is on. \u201cTrump\u2019s for all America and these four women hate America,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to change America into something I don\u2019t recognise. If they were a bunch of white choirboys, I would be saying the same thing. They say we have a racist country , but I think there is very little broken in America right now.\u201d Intentionally or not, Trump\u2019s embrace of white identity politics may work to his advantage next year. Only four House Republicans voted for a resolution to condemn his remarks. A Reuters/Ipsos poll showed his net approval among Republicans rose by five points to 72%. \u201cIt\u2019s a brilliant strategy,\u201d said Smith, who intends to vote for Trump again. \u201cHe is making those four the face of the Democratic party and the party is not distancing itself from them. Unless the Democrats become more realistic about what America wants and needs, he\u2019s going to point it out over and over again.\u201d \u2018He doesn\u2019t do anything without a purpose\u2019 Trump founded his political career on a conspiracy theory about Barack Obama\u2019s birthplace and saw his poll figures rise when he demanded a ban on Muslims entering the US. He won white voters by more than 20 points and appears to be aiming higher. His rallies become electrified not when he cites achievements or ambitions but when he unleashes bilious tirades against Obama, Clinton, political correctness and the media. The \u201csquad\u201d of four leftwing congresswomen of colourhas become his ideal foil. The quartet are more strongly disliked by Republicans than the Democrats\u2019 2020 candidates, according to an Economist-YouGov poll. Tyler Sewell, 53, sitting outside the Mudhouse Downtown cafe in Charlottesville, said Trump\u2019s racism was calculated. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t do anything without a purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s targeting that base and we know what he\u2019s saying. He wouldn\u2019t have said \u2018Go back where you came from\u2019 if he didn\u2019t really intend to say immigrants go home. \u201cHe\u2019s playing on this fear \u2013 there\u2019s a real white, blue-collar American fear of the browning of America. They\u2019re afraid of brown people. It\u2019s irrational. It\u2019s unavoidable. Our country is getting browner and that\u2019s just the way it\u2019s going to be. They see the browning of America as a loss of American values but it\u2019s American values we were all brought up with as white people.\u201d Sewell, who works in digital media, voted for Trump in 2016 but now bitterly regrets it and will not do so again. \u201cHe thinks he\u2019s going to win,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t imagine how he\u2019s ever going to win this time because I look at Republican women and I don\u2019t know a woman alive that\u2019s gonna vote for this man now. \u201cA lot of my Democrat friends are terrified.

I would like to take that vote back.\u201d \u2018I remember segregation\u2019 Trump supporters are scarce in Charlottesville, a college town where Hillary Clinton won nearly 80% of the vote and where the mayor is an African American woman. The white supremacists who stormed it came from elsewhere. The city regained its footing.

      "bodyText": "It started with Donald Trump\u2019s racist tweets demanding that four Democratic congresswomen \u2013 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley and Ilhan Omar \u2013 \u201cgo back\u201d to the \u201ccrime-infested places from which they came\u201d. All four women are American citizens and only one, Omar, was born overseas. On Wednesday, at a rally in North Carolina, Trump continued his attack, especially on Omar. In response, the crowd chanted: \u201cSend her back!\u201d Subsequently, Trump tried unconvincingly to distance himself from the chant. The relevant question is not whether Trump is a racist. Of course he is. Or whether he\u2019s going to continue bashing these members of Congress, who fill all his demonization boxes: Democrats, females, people of color, a Muslim. Of course he will. The real question is whether the people bankrolling Trump and the Republican party are going to stop this rot before it consumes the politics of 2020, and perhaps more. Early signs are not encouraging. Just before Trump\u2019s North Carolina rally, the Republican National Committee released an ad attacking the \u201cSquad\u201d, as the four congresswomen have become known. The ad opens with a clip of Ocasio-Cortez referring to migrant detention facilities as \u201cconcentration camps\u201d, then saying \u201c\u2018Never again\u2019 means something\u201d, referring to lessons from the Holocaust. That is followed by a clip from a 2018 primary debate where she asks her opponent, Joe Crowley, why he was willing to call Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or Ice, \u201cfascist\u201d but not to call for its elimination. It then cuts to Tlaib saying she agrees with Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s \u201cconcentration camp\u201d phrase, and to Pressley saying: \u201cYou will see the light. And if you don\u2019t, we will bring the fire.\u201d There follows footage of an attack on an Ice facility in Washington state, showing a burned car, and a facility in Colorado where an American flag was replaced with the flag of Mexico. It\u2019s profoundly misleading. The clips are all taken out of context. Pressley\u2019s reference to \u201cfire\u201d was part of a statement calling for a humane system and noting that positive change happens either because people see the light or feel the fire. The RNC is intentionally and mendaciously fueling the same racism Trump is fueling, for the same purpose: whipping up the base. Who is funding this horse manure? Much of the money that\u2019s flowing into Republican coffers is coming from the same place it\u2019s always come from: Wall Street. Last year, JP Morgan contributed $149,908 to the RNC. JP Morgan\u2019s chairman and chief executive, Jamie Dimon, is no racist. A few months ago, in a speech to the Economic Club of Chicago, he said white people don\u2019t adequately understand racial discrimination. \u201cIf you\u2019re white,\u201d he said, \u201cpaint yourself black and walk down the street one day, and you\u2019ll probably have a little more empathy for how some of these folks get treated. We need to make a special effort because this is a special problem.\u201d JP Morgan isn\u2019t the only Wall Street firm backing Republicans. Between April and June, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell collected $3m but just 9% of it came from individuals in his home state, Kentucky. The biggest block came from Wall Street hedge funds like the Blackstone Group ($95,400), KKR ($51,000), and Apollo Global Management and Golden Tree Management ($65,100). Why is Wall Street funding Trump\u2019s GOP? Because it is delighted with what Trump and Senate Republicans are giving it: tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks. Dimon was instrumental in getting the Trump-Republican tax cut through Congress. Last year it saved JP Morgan and the other big banks $21bn. Trump and the Republicans have also given Wall Street more freedom. They defanged the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and have allowed the banks to grow even larger, announcing more mergers and acquisitions in the first five months of 2019 than in any full-year period since the Street nearly imploded in 2008.

Since Trump\u2019s inauguration, JP Morgan\u2019s stock is up nearly a third. Dimon earned $31m in 2018. Asked recently how Trump was doing, Dimon gushed. \u201cRegulatory stuff, good.\u201d The summit with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un? A \u201cgreat idea.\u201d He also complimented the administration\u2019s \u201cnegotiating tactic\u201d on China and called the relationship between big business and the White House \u201cactive and good\u201d. Asked about Trump saying the Fed had \u201cgone crazy\u201d, Dimon said he had \u201cnever seen a president who wanted interest rates to go up\u201d. Wall Street and the CEOs of major corporations have made a hellish deal \u2013 ignore Trump\u2019s repugnance and provide ongoing support for the GOP regardless of its complicity in return for high returns. Perhaps they also believe that the flames of racism and xenophobia will distract the nation sufficiently for them to continue looting it. But a deal with the devil can exact a large toll.

      "body": "<p>Summer holiday season is upon us, and one of the little sun-lounger fantasies I like to indulge, undoubtedly along with millions of others, is the idea of jacking it all in and buying a one-way ticket to somewhere drenched in sunshine all year round but so cheap you can make your savings stretch. Then I get back to the 9-5, and the September drizzle, and file it away until next summer.</p> <p>But what if there\u2019s a bit more substance to this daydream \u2013 at least to the notion of working less, if not giving it up altogether? The idea of a shorter working week may sound fantastical but it\u2019s gaining traction on the left: last year the TUC backed a four-day week, and the shadow chancellor John McDonnell has commissioned a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-02/corbyn-toys-with-four-day-week-to-win-over-british-workers\" title=\"\">review</a> into it.</p> <p>It\u2019s not actually that radical an idea, as I found out while making a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0006zxz\" title=\"\">programme</a> on it for BBC Radio 4. The working week was once an 80-hour affair. As recently as 50 years ago, everyone assumed it would continue to get shorter; that as society became more prosperous, workers would enjoy the proceeds, not just in bigger pay cheques, but with more time off. University leisure studies departments flourished in the 60s and 70s as we supposedly stood poised to enter the age of recreation.</p> <p>So how did the five-day, 40-or-so-hour week come to be seen as standard? Trade unions got weaker, but that\u2019s far from the whole story, according to the historian Ben Hunnicutt. Around the turn of the 20th century, work evolved from being simply a means to an end for the vast majority, to an end to aspire to in itself. This was compounded by an explosion of consumerism in the 1920s. At first, this worked in favour of a shorter week: Henry Ford was one of the first manufacturers to move his factories from a six- to a five-day week, partly because he knew that in order to sell more cars, people needed the free time to enjoy them. But only up to a point: our reliance on consumption-fuelled economic growth put us on a treadmill that\u2019s not so much work to live as work to buy.</p> <p>There were a couple of points in history where we could have got back on to the path of shorter working time; both came at moments of economic crisis.

      "bodyText": "Summer holiday season is upon us, and one of the little sun-lounger fantasies I like to indulge, undoubtedly along with millions of others, is the idea of jacking it all in and buying a one-way ticket to somewhere drenched in sunshine all year round but so cheap you can make your savings stretch. Then I get back to the 9-5, and the September drizzle, and file it away until next summer. But what if there\u2019s a bit more substance to this daydream \u2013 at least to the notion of working less, if not giving it up altogether? The idea of a shorter working week may sound fantastical but it\u2019s gaining traction on the left: last year the TUC backed a four-day week, and the shadow chancellor John McDonnell has commissioned a review into it. It\u2019s not actually that radical an idea, as I found out while making a programme on it for BBC Radio 4. The working week was once an 80-hour affair. As recently as 50 years ago, everyone assumed it would continue to get shorter; that as society became more prosperous, workers would enjoy the proceeds, not just in bigger pay cheques, but with more time off. University leisure studies departments flourished in the 60s and 70s as we supposedly stood poised to enter the age of recreation. So how did the five-day, 40-or-so-hour week come to be seen as standard? Trade unions got weaker, but that\u2019s far from the whole story, according to the historian Ben Hunnicutt. Around the turn of the 20th century, work evolved from being simply a means to an end for the vast majority, to an end to aspire to in itself. This was compounded by an explosion of consumerism in the 1920s. At first, this worked in favour of a shorter week: Henry Ford was one of the first manufacturers to move his factories from a six- to a five-day week, partly because he knew that in order to sell more cars, people needed the free time to enjoy them. But only up to a point: our reliance on consumption-fuelled economic growth put us on a treadmill that\u2019s not so much work to live as work to buy. There were a couple of points in history where we could have got back on to the path of shorter working time; both came at moments of economic crisis. President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s initial response to the Great Depression was to back a 30-hour working week, the idea being to share the dwindling pool of work among more people. But US manufacturers persuaded him to switch tack. In 1974, Ted Heath\u2019s Conservative government temporarily imposed a three-day working week in energy-intensive sectors to conserve the coal supply.While the 1970s have a reputation for being an economic disaster zone, productivity rose by 5% in just two months as a result of the three-day week. But the Reagan-Thatcher consensus that followed cemented the idea of work as fundamental to growth; leisure as, at best, irrelevant. Ten years on from the financial crash, in an age of sluggish wage growth, it\u2019s time to revisit it. The promise of work as something that can give our lives fulfilment and meaning hasn\u2019t materialised. Three-quarters of British workers have little enthusiasm for their work, with one in five resentful and unhappy. One in eight live below the poverty line. There was a lot of talk about improving the quality of low-paid work during the Blair-Brown years. It\u2019s a worthy objective, but doesn\u2019t eliminate the uncomfortable truth that there are some jobs that aren\u2019t the pinnacle of aspiration for most of those who do them.

What we need is certainly not the mindless \u201cwe won the war, we can win again\u201d line peddled by Brexit supporters, but also not the kind of pessimism that paralyses action. There are numerous signs that the awakening that Olusoga calls for is brewing. One of the most encouraging developments is that, whereas before 2016 the EU was the subject of almost total national ignorance, now we see a flourishing pro-EU enthusiasm, especially among the young, and a much wider understanding of it, including both its strengths and its weaknesses.

If you are 16, 18 or indeed 21, in employment terms you are an innocent.

We need many more alongside them \u2013 even more so in an economy in which technology is making the life cycle of firms so much shorter, now closer to 20 years than the 50 of the mid-20th century.</p> <p>The only answer to this lack of permanence is to stand by those organisations we do have, to help new companies to grow so that they can share the load, and to build public institutions that can take some of the strain. It is stakeholder capitalism \u2013 which every instinct within rightwing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/14/business-has-good-reason-to-fear-boris-johnson-brexit-plans\" title=\"\">Johnsonian Brexiters</a> abhors.</p> <p>After all, the young cannot always stand on their own; they need to be offered the first rungs of the ladder. Later, they may strike out, but those first steps are crucial. They need to be nurtured, to get an idea of what work can be \u2013 and what might suit their skills, values and ambitions.</p> <p>But the new right does not believe in institutions that exist over time, transmit values and which root societies and the next generation. The one-nation right certainly believed in the value of what Edmund Burke called the \u201clittle platoons\u201d in society to which we belong.</p> <p>But the new nihilist Brexit right, often cocooned by privilege and private money, regards such thinking as flabby. It believes individuals should stand on their own two feet as soon as possible; organisations must put their own immediate profitability first and foremost. All British businesses must expect to be taken over by any bidder at any time in the name of efficiency and global Britain. The public sector must put belt-tightening minimalism first. Forget values other than those of the marketplace and lower taxes. Certainly any obligation to the young can go hang.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"03725c63d904c6acdcd75a24f2d1cd243ccb7b59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03725c63d904c6acdcd75a24f2d1cd243ccb7b59/0_124_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Denis Healey with Tessa Jowell in 1978\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Denis Healey with Tessa Jowell in 1978: \u2018The Labour party used to possess leaders \u2013 Roy Jenkins, Denis Healey, Neil Kinnock, John Smith, even Tony Blair \u2013 who understood the intertwining of the economic, social and cultural, and its roots in pro-Europeanism.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The impact is profound.

A history, English, classics or modern language degree is not going to serve you well in the contemporary job market with transient firms that value only immediately useful skills. The degrees that might offer better protection are in computer science, engineering, medicine, law or accountancy. Hence the number doing history degrees <a href=\"https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/facts-and-stats/data-and-analysis/Documents/patterns-and-trends-in-uk-higher-education-2018.pdf\" title=\"\">has fallen 10%</a> over the past decade \u2013 those doing Stem subjects steadily rising. In the US the numbers completing history degrees are down a third over the same period, foretelling an acceleration of the trends in Britain.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The new right does not believe in institutions that exist over time and transmit values</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The country undoubtedly needs more computer scientists, medics and engineers \u2013 but as a society surely not at the expense of the humanities, whose essence is captured in the name. A society that has forgotten its history, is ignorant of its poetry and most of whose citizens have no understanding of foreign languages or culture is withering. An organisation staffed only by those with instrumental skills will have little sense of its purpose or social place, which is the ultimate guarantor of success. The best scientists know they need their humanity colleagues \u2013 in a firm as much as a college.</p> <p>It is not blinkered university humanities lecturers who are to blame for this intensifying bias \u2013 as suggested in a recent article in <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/britain/2019/07/18/the-study-of-history-is-in-decline-in-britain\" title=\"\">the <em>Economist</em></a>. They are committed scholars ready to do whatever they can to make their subjects relevant and accessible. But students will only value the humanities if society values them. And that means nurturing the organisations that have a sufficiently long-term sense of themselves and their purpose to be able to recruit from across the academic disciplines.</p> <p>That in turn requires a vision of the good society \u2013 one reason why increasingly I have come to characterise Brexit as a cultural civil war. There is no prospect that Brexit can improve the deal for our young, economically or culturally. Public finances and organisations alike will be under more pressure. The language of very rightwing politicians will become the new common sense. Drug use will intensify at the bottom \u2013 and the cultural ballast in our society, loving history or Shakespeare for their own sakes, will decline.</p> <p>The young sense this: it is why they voted so overwhelmingly to stay in the EU, and would do so in greater numbers today. The task is to create and build more great firms and organisations that offer our young a chance \u2013 not to throw what we have away as bait for the Chinese, Indians and Americans to do some merciless trade deal.</p> <p>The Labour party used to possess leaders \u2013 Roy Jenkins, Denis Healey, Neil Kinnock, John Smith, even Tony Blair \u2013 who understood the intertwining of the economic, social and cultural, and its roots in pro-Europeanism. My criticism of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/09/corbyn-says-labour-would-back-remain-in-brexit-referendum\" title=\"\">Jeremy Corbyn</a> is that he has never even got close.

We need many more alongside them \u2013 even more so in an economy in which technology is making the life cycle of firms so much shorter, now closer to 20 years than the 50 of the mid-20th century. The only answer to this lack of permanence is to stand by those organisations we do have, to help new companies to grow so that they can share the load, and to build public institutions that can take some of the strain. It is stakeholder capitalism \u2013 which every instinct within rightwing Johnsonian Brexiters abhors. After all, the young cannot always stand on their own; they need to be offered the first rungs of the ladder. Later, they may strike out, but those first steps are crucial. They need to be nurtured, to get an idea of what work can be \u2013 and what might suit their skills, values and ambitions. But the new right does not believe in institutions that exist over time, transmit values and which root societies and the next generation. The one-nation right certainly believed in the value of what Edmund Burke called the \u201clittle platoons\u201d in society to which we belong. But the new nihilist Brexit right, often cocooned by privilege and private money, regards such thinking as flabby. It believes individuals should stand on their own two feet as soon as possible; organisations must put their own immediate profitability first and foremost. All British businesses must expect to be taken over by any bidder at any time in the name of efficiency and global Britain. The public sector must put belt-tightening minimalism first. Forget values other than those of the marketplace and lower taxes. Certainly any obligation to the young can go hang. The impact is profound. The young know too many of their elders don\u2019t give a shit and have created a world of unforgiving dysfunction at both the top and bottom. (It\u2019s one if the reasons for the epidemic of drug abuse, discarded needles and addiction a new public health menace.) Even those lucky enough to go to university can read the runes. A history, English, classics or modern language degree is not going to serve you well in the contemporary job market with transient firms that value only immediately useful skills. The degrees that might offer better protection are in computer science, engineering, medicine, law or accountancy. Hence the number doing history degrees has fallen 10% over the past decade \u2013 those doing Stem subjects steadily rising. In the US the numbers completing history degrees are down a third over the same period, foretelling an acceleration of the trends in Britain. The country undoubtedly needs more computer scientists, medics and engineers \u2013 but as a society surely not at the expense of the humanities, whose essence is captured in the name. A society that has forgotten its history, is ignorant of its poetry and most of whose citizens have no understanding of foreign languages or culture is withering. An organisation staffed only by those with instrumental skills will have little sense of its purpose or social place, which is the ultimate guarantor of success. The best scientists know they need their humanity colleagues \u2013 in a firm as much as a college. It is not blinkered university humanities lecturers who are to blame for this intensifying bias \u2013 as suggested in a recent article in the Economist. They are committed scholars ready to do whatever they can to make their subjects relevant and accessible. But students will only value the humanities if society values them. And that means nurturing the organisations that have a sufficiently long-term sense of themselves and their purpose to be able to recruit from across the academic disciplines. That in turn requires a vision of the good society \u2013 one reason why increasingly I have come to characterise Brexit as a cultural civil war. There is no prospect that Brexit can improve the deal for our young, economically or culturally. Public finances and organisations alike will be under more pressure. The language of very rightwing politicians will become the new common sense. Drug use will intensify at the bottom \u2013 and the cultural ballast in our society, loving history or Shakespeare for their own sakes, will decline. The young sense this: it is why they voted so overwhelmingly to stay in the EU, and would do so in greater numbers today. The task is to create and build more great firms and organisations that offer our young a chance \u2013 not to throw what we have away as bait for the Chinese, Indians and Americans to do some merciless trade deal. The Labour party used to possess leaders \u2013 Roy Jenkins, Denis Healey, Neil Kinnock, John Smith, even Tony Blair \u2013 who understood the intertwining of the economic, social and cultural, and its roots in pro-Europeanism. My criticism of Jeremy Corbyn is that he has never even got close. Surely someone, somewhere can find the words and philosophy around which lost liberal, pro-European Britain can rally \u2013 if only for our youth. \u2022 Will Hutton is an Observer columnist",

The Civil Aviation Safety Authority has suspended operations of GippsAero GA8 aircraft after the accident in Umeo on 14 July. No one on board survived the crash. The GA8 is manufactured in Australia by GippsAero, which is based in the Latrobe Valley. CASA said in a statement it had temporarily suspended all flights pending the outcome of an investigation by Swedish and European authorities. The suspension will be for up to 15 days from 20 July to midnight 3 August and affects all GA8 aircraft operating in Australia and all Australian-registered GA8 aircraft operating overseas. There are 63 GA8 aircraft registered in Australia out of a worldwide fleet of 228. The GA8 is a single-engine high-wing aeroplane with fixed tricycle landing gear. In Australia, the GA8 is used in a range of operations including charter, aerial work and parachuting. \u201cCASA has written to all Australian operators of GA8 aircraft advising them of the temporary suspension and reminding them of their obligation to comply with all applicable GA8 airworthiness directives issued by CASA,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cCASA has also written to all national aviation authorities who have GA8 aircraft operating in their jurisdiction advising them that CASA has imposed a 15-day temporary operating suspension on these aircraft.\u201d CASA said the authority had been working closely with Sweden and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency. It said in response to the temporary suspension of GA8 operations in Australia, EASA had issued an emergency airworthiness directive to European GA8 aircraft owners and operators to not operate the aeroplane except for ferry flights. CASA has also sent an airworthiness engineer to Sweden to observe the accident investigation and collect safety information. The authority said GippsAero held a production certificate issued by CASA to manufacture the GA8 and the company was subject to regular surveillance and safety checks by CASA. The aircraft type was certified in 2000 by CASA for normal operations, which includes skydiving.",

Panama began the flag-withdrawal process on Friday after an investigation determined the tanker had \u201cdeliberately violated international regulations\u201d by not reporting any unusual situation, the authority said in a statement. \u201cWe roundly condemn the use of Panamanian flagged ships for illicit activities,\u201d it said.

Just the Lumber River, the color of black tea, carrying out its slow, silent ambush, creeping up to the steps of the Baptist church and the rototillers at the hardware store and the 99-cent greeting cards in the pharmacy.</p> <p>In her final hours in the home where she grew up, 55-year-old Bonnie Savage pulled a load of warm clothes from the dryer and folded them. She was hardly concerned about Hurricane Matthew. It had come ashore in South Carolina as a category 1 and was a tropical storm by the time it tumbled inland and into her hometown of Fair Bluff in eastern North Carolina.</p> <p>Before that night \u2013 8 October 2016 \u2013 the only major flood in Fair Bluff came in 1928, courtesy of the Okeechobee hurricane. Hurricanes, most people in Fair Bluff believed, were problems for people who lived at the beach. Climate change, they often thought, was hogwash. Most of the 1,000 or so people in Fair Bluff had never seen more than ankle-deep puddles in their streets. No way, they believed, could Matthew drop 13 inches of rain that weekend and leave 71 of their homes uninhabitable.</p> <p>Certainly it couldn\u2019t happen again just two years later with an even more brutal storm named Florence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"divider\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">divider</a> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"30bbcf4bca1a85daae6755b1f898a09b603d289a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30bbcf4bca1a85daae6755b1f898a09b603d289a/0_0_2200_1467/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A boat passes through a flooded neighborhood in this aerial photograph taken above Wallace, North Carolina.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A boat passes through a flooded neighborhood in this aerial photograph taken above Wallace, North Carolina.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Wroblewski/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Often, floods stir images of water rushing recklessly through communities. But in the flat coastal plain of North Carolina, where sandy soil has been shifting since it was ocean floor 100m years ago, water is slow to rise and recede. The floods that followed Matthew and Florence in 2018 left Fair Bluff\u2019s downtown underwater for more than two weeks each time.</p> <p>Now, as the 2019 hurricane season begins, few communities have more to lose than this one. If another arrives this year, Fair Bluff could become one of the US\u2019s first climate crisis ghost towns.</p> <p>Officials want to rebuild a new downtown on higher ground, but they don\u2019t have the money. Downtown is vacant now and Fair Bluff\u2019s population has dropped by half to 450. They\u2019re racing to get people back into homes before 2020 US census, or else they will face significant reductions in state and federal funding.</p> <p>All this seemed unfathomable the night Matthew hit as Savage folded her laundry. And as 40-year-old Jimmy Moore parked his white Saturn View next to the plum tree in his backyard after finishing his work shift sorting sweet potatoes. And as former mayor Randy Britt told his wife they should stop by their hardware store in the morning. And as Ray Lundy, the retired minister of the Fair Bluff Baptist church, planned to meet his daughter at her pharmacy after sunrise.</p> <p>But the next morning, 9 October, dozens of Fair Bluff residents woke up and put their feet down in the river beside their beds that Matthew had brought.</p> <p>Moore saw the water over the hood of his Saturn. Britt and his wife waded thigh-deep through their hardware store. Lundytook a boat to his daughter\u2019s pharmacy. He saw a pack of diapers float out. His eyes followed them, leading to a string of goods flowing down the street.</p> <p>\u201cThere goes Fair Bluff,\u201d Lundy said.</p> <p>For Savage, sheltering elsewhere, the bad news came from a neighbor.</p> <p>\u201cYour house is underwater,\u201d he called to tell her.</p> <p>\u201cYou got to be kidding,\u201d she said. \u201cMy house ain\u2019t underwater.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBonnie,\u201d her friend said. \u201cYour house.

Matthew caused nearly $5bn worth of damage. Twenty-three months later, Florence dropped a record 8tn gallons of water, washing out 200 North Carolina roads, making instant islands across the state . More than 2,500 people were rescued, and 15,000 needed emergency shelter. Forty died.</p> <p>In the past century, North Carolina has endured 15 major storms. The three worst, in terms of cost of damage, have occurred in the past 20 years \u2013 Florence, Matthew and Floyd in 1999.</p> <p>They have caused a shift in conversations about hurricane preparation.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>In the past century, North Carolina has endured 15 major storms. The three worst, in terms of cost of damage, have occurred in the past 20 years</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Across the state, local governments are adopting new zoning measures to prevent construction in 100-year flood areas. Zurich Insurance <a href=\"https://www.zurichna.com/en/knowledge/articles/2019/04/hurricane-florence-building-resilience-for-the-new-normal\">conducted an extensive post-storm study</a> that concluded the state needs to be more aggressive about buying out vulnerable properties.

After her divorce in the early 2000s, she moved back. Her mother died in 2005, leaving her in the house alone. She liked the peace and quiet and independence.</p> <p>Now she felt nauseous as she opened the door. The soaked floors were warped. Her mother\u2019s china cabinet was ruined, and the 70-year-old pine bed was split down the middle. She wondered if she could save anything.</p> <p>Then she saw the laundry basket, still up on the washer. Finally, a reason to smile.</p> <p>She moved those clothes into her brother\u2019s house and waited. Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) workers assessed damage. Rescue workers stayed as long as they could, but they couldn\u2019t save her childhood home.</p> <p>\u201cEvery time you turned around, somebody was giving out shovels and rakes and cleaning supplies,\u201d Savage says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like: \u2018I don\u2019t need no cleaning supplies! I need a house!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Savage moved in with her brother and waited for word on a new house. Throughout eastern North Carolina over the next year-plus, residents grew frustrated. The state had been declared a disaster area, but Fema funds were slow to arrive. While richer counties, like the one around Charlotte, already have aggressive buyout programs in flood zones, areas in the coastal plain can\u2019t just shift cash like that. The Charlotte program pays about $100,000 a house; Fair Bluff\u2019s total operating budget is just $660,000.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"25d64d2bd653632d4e1ccb09345ddb499d63c197\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25d64d2bd653632d4e1ccb09345ddb499d63c197/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Randy Britt works to clean one of his downtown buildings after flooding due to Hurricane Florence receded in Fair Bluff, North Carolina, U.S. September 29, 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Randy Britt works to clean one of his downtown buildings after flooding due to Hurricane Florence receded in Fair Bluff, North Carolina, in September 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Randall Hill/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now, with its tax base decimated, Fair Bluff\u2019s only chance at survival is state and federal funding.</p> <p>Savage\u2019s home was one of 71 Fair Bluff applications approved by Fema\u2019s hazard mitigation program in spring 2018. The only place to receive more approvals was Lumberton with 101. Lumberton is 20 times the size of Fair Bluff.</p> <p>The town named a contractor, the Adams Company, as administrator of the $8m disaster mitigation funds. The company gave homeowners three options: have their vacated home bought at a pre-flood value, repair and elevate the home if it\u2019s still structurally sound or build a new home and elevate it on the same land.</p> <p>Savage chose the last option: new home, same land, higher.</p> <p>On 30 August 2018, nearly two years after Matthew, Adams was completing its interviews with the 71 homeowners when a wave of tropical air emerged off the west coast of Africa.</p> <p>Over the next week, the wave would become a storm and the storm would become a hurricane.

      "bodyText": "The water slithered up while the people went to sleep. No text alerts. No sirens. Just the Lumber River, the color of black tea, carrying out its slow, silent ambush, creeping up to the steps of the Baptist church and the rototillers at the hardware store and the 99-cent greeting cards in the pharmacy. In her final hours in the home where she grew up, 55-year-old Bonnie Savage pulled a load of warm clothes from the dryer and folded them. She was hardly concerned about Hurricane Matthew. It had come ashore in South Carolina as a category 1 and was a tropical storm by the time it tumbled inland and into her hometown of Fair Bluff in eastern North Carolina. Before that night \u2013 8 October 2016 \u2013 the only major flood in Fair Bluff came in 1928, courtesy of the Okeechobee hurricane. Hurricanes, most people in Fair Bluff believed, were problems for people who lived at the beach. Climate change, they often thought, was hogwash. Most of the 1,000 or so people in Fair Bluff had never seen more than ankle-deep puddles in their streets. No way, they believed, could Matthew drop 13 inches of rain that weekend and leave 71 of their homes uninhabitable. Certainly it couldn\u2019t happen again just two years later with an even more brutal storm named Florence. Often, floods stir images of water rushing recklessly through communities. But in the flat coastal plain of North Carolina, where sandy soil has been shifting since it was ocean floor 100m years ago, water is slow to rise and recede. The floods that followed Matthew and Florence in 2018 left Fair Bluff\u2019s downtown underwater for more than two weeks each time. Now, as the 2019 hurricane season begins, few communities have more to lose than this one. If another arrives this year, Fair Bluff could become one of the US\u2019s first climate crisis ghost towns. Officials want to rebuild a new downtown on higher ground, but they don\u2019t have the money. Downtown is vacant now and Fair Bluff\u2019s population has dropped by half to 450. They\u2019re racing to get people back into homes before 2020 US census, or else they will face significant reductions in state and federal funding. All this seemed unfathomable the night Matthew hit as Savage folded her laundry. And as 40-year-old Jimmy Moore parked his white Saturn View next to the plum tree in his backyard after finishing his work shift sorting sweet potatoes. And as former mayor Randy Britt told his wife they should stop by their hardware store in the morning. And as Ray Lundy, the retired minister of the Fair Bluff Baptist church, planned to meet his daughter at her pharmacy after sunrise. But the next morning, 9 October, dozens of Fair Bluff residents woke up and put their feet down in the river beside their beds that Matthew had brought. Moore saw the water over the hood of his Saturn. Britt and his wife waded thigh-deep through their hardware store. Lundytook a boat to his daughter\u2019s pharmacy. He saw a pack of diapers float out. His eyes followed them, leading to a string of goods flowing down the street. \u201cThere goes Fair Bluff,\u201d Lundy said. For Savage, sheltering elsewhere, the bad news came from a neighbor. \u201cYour house is underwater,\u201d he called to tell her. \u201cYou got to be kidding,\u201d she said. \u201cMy house ain\u2019t underwater.\u201d \u201cBonnie,\u201d her friend said. \u201cYour house. Is under. Water.\u201d On a weeknight this June, Fair Bluff\u2019s mayor, Billy Hammond, watched people stare at a board with the instruction: \u201cPlease pick three descriptive words that describe Fair Bluff\u2019s future.\u201d For Hammond, who moved here as a child in 1959, the first indication that Fair Bluff would never be the same after Matthew came via a 5am call from the police chief. \u201cYour town is flooded,\u201d the chief said. Those words are now familiar to officials across eastern North Carolina. Matthew caused nearly $5bn worth of damage. Twenty-three months later, Florence dropped a record 8tn gallons of water, washing out 200 North Carolina roads, making instant islands across the state . More than 2,500 people were rescued, and 15,000 needed emergency shelter. Forty died. In the past century, North Carolina has endured 15 major storms. The three worst, in terms of cost of damage, have occurred in the past 20 years \u2013 Florence, Matthew and Floyd in 1999. They have caused a shift in conversations about hurricane preparation. Across the state, local governments are adopting new zoning measures to prevent construction in 100-year flood areas. Zurich Insurance conducted an extensive post-storm study that concluded the state needs to be more aggressive about buying out vulnerable properties. Thirty years from now, the report says, Wilmington, a city of 120,000 hit hard by Florence, can expect 70 days of sunny-day flooding each year. \u201cImagine how bad it could be,\u201d the authors wrote, \u201cand plan for worse.\u201d Many former skeptics now concede the climate is changing. \u201cIt\u2019s real,\u201d says Lundy, the longtime Baptist minister. \u201cI\u2019m 76, and I\u2019ve never seen any storms like that.\u201d Not everyone, though. Evelyn Waddell stared at the board with the question about Fair Bluff\u2019s future and put marks next to three words: friendly, creative and hometown. She lives on Gapway Road, where four consecutive houses are abandoned. Her home made it through OK. Asked if she agrees storms will keep getting stronger, Waddell says: \u201cWhy would they? I hate to hear the negative.\u201d This disconnect creates tension in discussions about moving forward. Of the 17 words on that board about the future, the two most popular are \u201cuncertain\u201d and \u201cchallenging\u201d. Bonnie Savage asked a rescue worker to give her a boat ride to inspect her house the next morning after Matthew. She had moved into the three-bedroom home with her parents when she was about 13. After her divorce in the early 2000s, she moved back. Her mother died in 2005, leaving her in the house alone. She liked the peace and quiet and independence. Now she felt nauseous as she opened the door. The soaked floors were warped. Her mother\u2019s china cabinet was ruined, and the 70-year-old pine bed was split down the middle. She wondered if she could save anything. Then she saw the laundry basket, still up on the washer. Finally, a reason to smile. She moved those clothes into her brother\u2019s house and waited. Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) workers assessed damage. Rescue workers stayed as long as they could, but they couldn\u2019t save her childhood home. \u201cEvery time you turned around, somebody was giving out shovels and rakes and cleaning supplies,\u201d Savage says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like: \u2018I don\u2019t need no cleaning supplies! I need a house!\u2019\u201d Savage moved in with her brother and waited for word on a new house. Throughout eastern North Carolina over the next year-plus, residents grew frustrated. The state had been declared a disaster area, but Fema funds were slow to arrive. While richer counties, like the one around Charlotte, already have aggressive buyout programs in flood zones, areas in the coastal plain can\u2019t just shift cash like that. The Charlotte program pays about $100,000 a house; Fair Bluff\u2019s total operating budget is just $660,000. Now, with its tax base decimated, Fair Bluff\u2019s only chance at survival is state and federal funding. Savage\u2019s home was one of 71 Fair Bluff applications approved by Fema\u2019s hazard mitigation program in spring 2018. The only place to receive more approvals was Lumberton with 101. Lumberton is 20 times the size of Fair Bluff. The town named a contractor, the Adams Company, as administrator of the $8m disaster mitigation funds. The company gave homeowners three options: have their vacated home bought at a pre-flood value, repair and elevate the home if it\u2019s still structurally sound or build a new home and elevate it on the same land. Savage chose the last option: new home, same land, higher. On 30 August 2018, nearly two years after Matthew, Adams was completing its interviews with the 71 homeowners when a wave of tropical air emerged off the west coast of Africa. Over the next week, the wave would become a storm and the storm would become a hurricane. Florence sized up North Carolina as a category 4 before wind shear weakened its gusts. Florence made landfall as a category 1 on 13 September and then stayed, and stayed, pumping water on the state like a firehose. Every river in eastern North Carolina surged over its banks. The water topped fully grown cornstalks and left ocean fish lining interstates. Three days after the rain stopped, Bonnie Savage and the other 71 people flooded out after Matthew watched the Lumber rise again, and rise some more. For the first time in the 23 months since she lost her home, she cried. Jimmy Moore picks a plum off the tree in his yard and bites into it. \u201cTart,\u201d he says, making a face. Moore lives on Gapway Road, the only one of Fair Bluff\u2019s original roads that remains the same as when the town\u2019s founders carved it out in 1811. He\u2019s a few houses down from Waddell, the optimist from the meeting about Fair Bluff\u2019s future. That\u2019s another thing that makes Fair Bluff different: mosteastern North Carolina towns are deeply segregated. Here white people like Wadell and people of color like Moore are neighbors. Moore\u2019s parents bought the land in 1991. His dad, a bricklayer, built several pillars out front and topped them with concrete eagles. In one, he inscribed the date they moved in: 10 November 1991. Jimmy would have been about 15. On the night Matthew came through, Jimmy shared the home with his brother and father. As the water climbed the steps, they called in a boat rescue. Unlike most of their neighbors, though, they had flood insurance. They were able to start the rebuilding process before waiting for Fema. They were back in a new, raised double-wide less than six months after the storm. Today, as he picks plums, he\u2019s two lots over from where a stretch of four consecutive vacant homes begins. One still has belongings from inside in a pile in the yard. \u201cThis is the only town that\u2019s not recovering from the hurricane,\u201d Jimmy says. \u201cIt\u2019s just like everything\u2019s on halt. Everything\u2019s stopped. But if you go into town they\u2019ve got this big old town hall built.\u201d He\u2019s talking about the biggest point of contention right now in Fair Bluff: the struggling town has a spanking new town hall. To understand how it got there, you have to go back. In the 1990s, 46 attorneys general reached a settlement with the country\u2019s four largest tobacco companies on smoking-related illnesses. The payout, $206bn, was the largest civil litigation in US history. North Carolina, one of the biggest tobacco-producing states, established the Golden Leaf Foundation to manage its portion of the settlement. The foundation awards education and technology grants primarily to rural areas affected by the collapse of the tobacco industry. Six months after Matthew, Golden Leaf awarded Fair Bluff about $1.75m to renovate and expand the town hall, police department and visitors\u2019 center. The buildings opened in the spring of this year, about six months after Florence, and with half of Fair Bluff\u2019s population still displaced. Officials say it\u2019s critical to have a central building for a town, but they understand why some residents are upset. \u201cThey\u2019re discouraged, and then they see this,\u201d Paula Kempton, the town project manager, says, gesturing around her office in the new building. \u201cWell, this is theirs, too. This represents that Fair Bluff is still fighting to stay here to make sure they have a town for their people.\u201d To the regular resident money is money, and they don\u2019t see why it wasn\u2019t spent on their homes. Many don\u2019t have time to wait. Fair Bluff\u2019s average age is about 55, making it the oldest in Columbus county. Hammond says he has seen an increase in heart-related illnesses and deaths, which he attributes to stress. But few want to leave. Jimmy now lives in the new home with an older brother.

And that\u2019s all she wrote from Charlotte\u2019s Bank of America Stadium as Arsenal\u2019s starlets impress once more in a 3-0 triumph over Fiorentina on goals by Eddie Nketiah (twice) and Joe Willock. 90 min: The fourth official signals for three minutes of added time. A composed right-footed finish by the teenager from the center of the area off build-up play from Mkhitaryan and Lacazette and Arsenal are headed for three points. 88 min: Martinelli showed electric pace in beating a defender in full trot and is all alone with only the keeper the keep but he can\u2019t deposit the finish! So close to making it three for Arsenal and really putting a stamp on his introduction with the team. 83 min: A poor giveaway by Xhaka forces Maitland-Niles to bring down Sottil and the midfielder is shown yellow, giving Fiorentina a free kick that\u2019s deflected out for a corner. The pace seems to be petering out of this one. 81 min: The announced attendance for today\u2019s match is 34,902. 79 min: One (presumably) final wave of substitutions for Arsenal as Mustafi, Thompson, Xhaka, Ozil, Maitland-Niles and Martinelli come on for Medley, Monreal, Burton, Jenkinson, Nelson and Nketiah, who was brilliant today. 75 min: Willock is cut down in a run on goal with a hard tackle and he\u2019s treated by the medical staff briefly before remaining in the game. One final water break before the final quarter hour. 72 min: A raft of changes for Fiorentina as Baez, Millenkovic, Hancko, Simeone and Eyserric come on for Terzik, Ranieri, Benassi, Vlahovic and Sottil. Chants of \u201cEd-die! Ed-die!\u201d ring through the lower bowl after Nketiah bags his second of the day with an elementary right-footed finish after some wonderful interplay up the right flank involving five different Arsenal players. What a day for the youngster: a pair of goals for his team and denying Fiorentina another with his clearance off the line in the 36th minute. 61 min: The pace has dipped a bit at the hour mark as we pause for a mandatory water break. Emery takes the opportunity to make a few more changes with Mkhitaryan, Willock and Sokratis coming on for Saka, Olayinka and Chambers. 57 min: Lacazette\u2019s free kick has pace but doesn\u2019t get down over the wall and soars out for a goal kick. 56 min: Terracciano comes off his line to punch a ball away but he\u2019s well outside the box and whistled for a handball. Very weird. He\u2019s shown yellow and Arsenal have a free kick from a dangerous position. 52 min: Lacazette finds room at the top of the area and sends a thunderbolt on goal but the keeper blocks it straight to the foot of Nelson, who is offside. Arsenal appear to have reverted to a 4-3-2-1 formation. 49 min: Vlahovic has a crack on goal after catching Chambers out of postion but Leno is there to make the save. 47 mins: A couple of changes for Arsenal with Leno coming on for Martinez and Lacazette for Kolasinac and the Gunners moving to a back four. 46 min: And we\u2019re off and running in the second half! Fiorentina have had their chances, but Eddie Nketiah\u2019s goal is the difference as the Gunners lead 1-0 at the break on a sweltering Saturday in Charlotte. 45 min+2: Moments from the half-time whistle Fiorentina dice the Arsenal back four once again with a deft flick from Saponara to Vlahovic, whose cheeky left-footed shot beats the keeper but rolls inches wide of the goal. 45 min: Another defensive miscue by the Gunners, this time a botched offside trap, leads to a golden chance for Sottil who goes clean through on a long ball on the right, but Martinez is able to make the save. The fourth official signals for three additional minutes. 41 min: The pace of this one has dragged to a near standstill and who can blame the players with this heat? Saponara is shown yellow for late tackle where he showed no real intention of going for the ball. 36 min: Another iffy moment for the Arsenal defense as Ceccherini\u2019s header on goal is blocked by Nketiah on the back line. 31 min: Jenkinson takes a crack from the right side of the area and it\u2019s deflected out for a corner for Arsenal, who have come to life over the past five minutes and testing the Fiorentina defense along the flanks. Another water break as the sun goes down over the roofline of the stadium (if not the 91F temperature yet). 27 min: Jenkinson is well positioned to make it two for Arsenal but a last-gasp tackle by Ranieri busts up the clear opportunity. That leads to a quick Fiorentina counter and a shot by Benassi that goes just wide past a fully extended Martinez wide of the far post. Big cheers from the crowd as Aubameyang and Ozil warm up along the touch line. 25 min: Brilliant work by the young Nketiah to beat Venuti down the left side with the ball, but with no one trailing in support he\u2019s left to take on the keeper on his own from a narrow angle and his shot is easily corralled. 21 min: Fiorentina send two men toward the far post as the ball is crossed in and Vlahovic\u2019s nearly converts but it goes out for another corner. Eyebrow-raising defending has been an undercurrent for the Gunners today but they\u2019ve not been made to pay for it yet. 18 min: Another careless giveaway by Arsenal after the restart as Monreal is intercepted and Fiorentina counter quickly, but it\u2019s disrupted by Chambers. Saka surges down the left flack before finding Kolasinac, who cuts back to Nketiah at the penalty spot and the 20-year-old cracks it into past a defender and the keeper into the back of the net. A wonderful right-footed finish by the promising youngster and Arsenal lead as the team\u2019s take their mandated water break. 15 min: More poor defending by the Gunners as Vlahovic takes advantage of a miscue and forces a good save by Martinez. Sottil nearly deposits the rebound but it\u2019s cleared out for a corner. 11 min: Now a chance for Fiorentina as the Saponara cuts into the area unmarked to meet a cross from the right flank, but he\u2019s unable to put the header on target. 8 min: Arsenal have their first serious chance of the day when Kolasinac\u2019s shot from just outside the area deflects off a Fiorentina player and just wide of the left-hand post. The Gunners are able to work another shot off the corner but it\u2019s quickly cleared by the Italian side. 6 min: More good possession from Arsenal as they probe and look to crack Fiorentina\u2019s well-organized 5-4-1. 3 min: A steady spell of possession for Arsenal from the kickoff, but a bad giveaway at the back leads to an opportunity for Vlahovic, whose shot inside the area is blocked by a defender. Lots of red shirts everywhere in the building: a strong Arsenal crowd. And Megan Rapinoe is here. 1 min: And they\u2019re off! Arsenal are attacking from right to left in their yellow kits, Fiorentina from left to right in their all-white strips. Did we mention it\u2019s hot? We can expect a slow pace to today\u2019s game due to the soaring temperatures. We\u2019re also told there will be water breaks every 15 minutes.
