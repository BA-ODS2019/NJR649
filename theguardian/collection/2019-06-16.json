It was like a discordant Last Night at the Proms, albeit closer to Sch\u00f6nberg than Elgar. And it proudly knocked Norman Tebbit\u2019s cricket test for six.</p> <p>What the game lacked in drama it made up for in atmosphere. And after a week where a record four matches were abandoned due to the wettest June on record it provided a much needed jolt of adrenaline.</p> <p>Even at 8.30am, two hours before the first ball was bowled, the streets around the Manchester ground had turned into a fiesta of colour and noise. Almost everyone was draped in avocado green or sapphire blue. One Pakistan fan even came on a white horse. But there would be no riding to his side\u2019s rescue later in the day.</p> <p>Among the Pakistan fans was Chaudhry Abdul Jalil, famously known as Chacha Cricket, the bearded mascot who has supported his country for 50 years. He predicted a party \u2013 and then a dazzling victory. \u201cI was with Pakistan and India supporters on Saturday night and came together with not a wrong turn,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cIndia have beaten us for six matches in the World Cup but this time it will be different.\u201d</p> <p>Organisers had taken precautions, beefing up the security. Yet it was not needed as Pakistan and India fans sat and sang as neighbours, side by side. \u201cIt is always electric when the two teams meet,\u201d said Qamar Ahmed, who had travelled from Essex with his 12-year-old son Momin. \u201cOf course there is rivalry but cricket brings our two countries together.

More than an hour after play had started organisers confirmed there were still more than a thousand people outside Old Trafford. Some were trying to sneak past the security guards. But most just wanted a small part in a shared communal experience.</p> <p>If Pakistan needed any more encouragement, it arrived just before play in a barrage of tweets from their prime minister, Imran Khan. His personal five-point plan to defeat India included winning the toss and batting, and banishing all negative thoughts. \u201cFear of losing leads to a negative and defensive strategy and crucially mistakes by opponents are not pounced upon,\u201d the man who had won the World Cup in 1992 told his 9.77m followers. \u201cJust give your best and fight till the last ball.

But soon his team had Pakistan in the cricket equivalent of the scorpion pose as the opener Rohit Sharma smashed three sixes and 14 fours in scoring 140 runs off 113 balls.</p> <p>While Sharma\u2019s bat became an instrument of torture, the Indian captain, Virat Kohli, preferred to accumulate his runs by stealth until accelerating to score a valuable 77 as India finished their 50 overs on 336 for five, their highest one-day score in England.</p> <p>Pakistan have a deserved reputation for being the most unpredictable team in world cricket. Yet after 25 overs they had steadily moved to 126 for two and could at least think about a shock win. However the omnipresent threat of showers meant they had to keep an eye not only on the scoreboard but on their calculators, too. The DLS method, used to adjust targets in rain-affected matches, was in play and Pakistan were behind the over rate.</p> <p>That meant they needed to accelerate their run rate \u2013 and fast \u2013 by smashing boundaries.

Indian genius played a part. The Pakistan batsman Babar Azam had looked dangerous, moving swiftly to 48 off 57 deliveries. But as he made to accelerate he was bamboozled by a sharply spinning delivery from Kuldeep Yadav that bowled him through the gate. Unsurprisingly it was immediately hailed as the \u201cball of the tournament\u201d.</p> <p>Pakistan knew their fate after that, although the weather meant it was a slow and prolonged death. When the game finally finished just before 7.30pm Indian fans were dancing on their seats and in the aisles, delighted at having thwarted the old enemy again. The Pakistani flags, meanwhile, were drooped at half mast.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The English weather has been a most unwelcome guest at this Cricket World Cup. But try as it might \u2013 and there were downpours and drizzle, as well as mist and mizzle at Old Trafford \u2013 it was unable to stop India emphatically proving their superiority over Pakistan in a match loudly billed as the most watched cricket game in history. As India finally confirmed their victory by 89 runs by the Byzantine Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method in the early evening gloom, one fan was beaming more than most. \u201cI\u2019ve paid the equivalent of \u00a34,000 to come to England for a week for this one match, so I am so thankful the rain didn\u2019t ruin it,\u201d said Tarum Babhala, a furniture seller from Delhi. \u201cThis is more important than winning the World Cup final, because India versus Pakistan is such an epic rivalry.\u201d Thousands of other second- and third-generation British Asians, who greeted every run by waving flags, thumping their drums and blasting their vuvuzelas, appeared to agree. It was like a discordant Last Night at the Proms, albeit closer to Sch\u00f6nberg than Elgar. And it proudly knocked Norman Tebbit\u2019s cricket test for six. What the game lacked in drama it made up for in atmosphere. And after a week where a record four matches were abandoned due to the wettest June on record it provided a much needed jolt of adrenaline. Even at 8.30am, two hours before the first ball was bowled, the streets around the Manchester ground had turned into a fiesta of colour and noise. Almost everyone was draped in avocado green or sapphire blue. One Pakistan fan even came on a white horse. But there would be no riding to his side\u2019s rescue later in the day. Among the Pakistan fans was Chaudhry Abdul Jalil, famously known as Chacha Cricket, the bearded mascot who has supported his country for 50 years. He predicted a party \u2013 and then a dazzling victory. \u201cI was with Pakistan and India supporters on Saturday night and came together with not a wrong turn,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cIndia have beaten us for six matches in the World Cup but this time it will be different.\u201d Organisers had taken precautions, beefing up the security. Yet it was not needed as Pakistan and India fans sat and sang as neighbours, side by side. \u201cIt is always electric when the two teams meet,\u201d said Qamar Ahmed, who had travelled from Essex with his 12-year-old son Momin. \u201cOf course there is rivalry but cricket brings our two countries together. It is a shame India and Pakistan don\u2019t play each other more often. There should be a cricket diplomacy.\u201d Some supporters came just to inhale the atmosphere. More than an hour after play had started organisers confirmed there were still more than a thousand people outside Old Trafford. Some were trying to sneak past the security guards. But most just wanted a small part in a shared communal experience. If Pakistan needed any more encouragement, it arrived just before play in a barrage of tweets from their prime minister, Imran Khan. His personal five-point plan to defeat India included winning the toss and batting, and banishing all negative thoughts. \u201cFear of losing leads to a negative and defensive strategy and crucially mistakes by opponents are not pounced upon,\u201d the man who had won the World Cup in 1992 told his 9.77m followers. \u201cJust give your best and fight till the last ball. Then accept whatever the result like true sportsmen. The nation\u2019s prayers are with all of you.\u201d India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, appeared to have his mind on other things, namely world yoga day. But soon his team had Pakistan in the cricket equivalent of the scorpion pose as the opener Rohit Sharma smashed three sixes and 14 fours in scoring 140 runs off 113 balls. While Sharma\u2019s bat became an instrument of torture, the Indian captain, Virat Kohli, preferred to accumulate his runs by stealth until accelerating to score a valuable 77 as India finished their 50 overs on 336 for five, their highest one-day score in England. Pakistan have a deserved reputation for being the most unpredictable team in world cricket. Yet after 25 overs they had steadily moved to 126 for two and could at least think about a shock win. However the omnipresent threat of showers meant they had to keep an eye not only on the scoreboard but on their calculators, too. The DLS method, used to adjust targets in rain-affected matches, was in play and Pakistan were behind the over rate. That meant they needed to accelerate their run rate \u2013 and fast \u2013 by smashing boundaries. But in going for glory they went down in flames, losing three wickets in 18 balls before rain stopped play at 166 for six. It was not all of their own making. Indian genius played a part. The Pakistan batsman Babar Azam had looked dangerous, moving swiftly to 48 off 57 deliveries. But as he made to accelerate he was bamboozled by a sharply spinning delivery from Kuldeep Yadav that bowled him through the gate. Unsurprisingly it was immediately hailed as the \u201cball of the tournament\u201d. Pakistan knew their fate after that, although the weather meant it was a slow and prolonged death. When the game finally finished just before 7.30pm Indian fans were dancing on their seats and in the aisles, delighted at having thwarted the old enemy again. The Pakistani flags, meanwhile, were drooped at half mast.",

      "bodyText": "The City regulator is launching a final call for payment protection insurance compensation, as the total paid out to consumers passes \u00a335bn. With just over two months to go until the deadline for lodging a PPI claim the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority is launching a new advertising campaign to encourage more applications. As well as bringing back the animatronic head of Arnold Schwarzenegger for the final time, the regulator has recruited 1990s TV fitness guru Mr Motivator and blogger Skint Dad to help promote its message. The FCA said the total amount of compensation paid since January 2011 to people who were mis-sold the policies now stands at \u00a335.3bn. In April 2019 alone, banks and other financial firms paid out \u00a3334m. PPI is Britain\u2019s costliest consumer scandal, with banks paying out billions of pounds to compensate people who purchased often worthless insurance cover, thinking it would help them repay debts in the event of sickness or unemployment. As many as 64m PPI policies have been sold in the UK, mostly between 1990 and 2010. Banks and other financial institutions pushed the policies alongside loans, credit cards and other deals \u2013 but in many cases, exclusions meant customers could never make a claim. The final deadline for complaining about the sale of PPI is 29 August 2019. Anyone who has not complained to their provider by that date will not be able to claim money back. Banks have regularly increased the amount they have set aside to cover claims. Lloyds Banking Group has been landed with the biggest bill: to date, the scandal has cost it more than \u00a319bn, with this set to rise further \u2013 the bank has said it expects to receive an average of 13,000 complaints a week up until the deadline. In previous FCA adverts, the model head of Schwarzenegger, mounted on tracks, was seen pursuing shoppers and urging them to stop procrastinating and make a decision about whether to put in a complaint. The regulator said that to emphasise how \u201cpressing\u201d the deadline was, it was launching a new series of adverts featuring the \u201cAnimatronic Arnie\u201d head apparently being crushed in a hydraulic press. The final deadline is aimed at drawing a line under the scandal in order to rebuild public trust in financial services and reduce uncertainty for banks and other firms worried about the open-ended nature of potential PPI liabilities. Helped along by the advertising campaign, the final 10 weeks or so are expected to see a late flurry of activity as genuine claimants finally get around to submitting their complaints, while others try their luck. The most effective way to make a PPI claim is to complain directly to the bank or financial firm concerned, and then to the Financial Ombudsman Service if necessary. Most claims firms charge a fee that can be up to 20% of any compensation paid.",

      "bodyText": "A trophy cabinet takes pride of place in the kitchen of Phil Foden\u2019s family home. It must be some kitchen. Must be some trophy cabinet, too, though it may not be around much longer should the England midfielder add the European Under\u201121 Championship to his impressive collection in the next fortnight. Foden has designs on a larger cabinet in the home he purchased for his parents, Phil and Claire, for around \u00a32m late last year. A historic domestic treble with Manchester City \u2013 making it five major honours won with his boyhood club before turning 19 last month \u2013 stands alongside the Under-17 World Cup plus a host of individual accolades in the teenager\u2019s showcase. It serves as a frequent reminder of how often the gifted talent has fulfilled expectations for club and country. And it is struggling. \u201cIt is not too bad,\u201d says Foden of a medal haul that began as an eight-year-old for Reddish Vulcans. \u201cI keep them all in a cabinet in the kitchen. It\u2019s getting full, though. I might need a new one. Sometimes I\u2019ll walk past and just have a look, and realise I\u2019ve won a lot. The World Cup was the first, the biggest one I\u2019d won, and then I started winning trophies with City, cups and leagues. It\u2019s hard to pick one out. Every single one is special to me.\u201d It was at the World Cup in 2017 that Foden announced his vast potential to a wider audience with two goals in the final over Spain and a string of impressive displays that earned him the Golden Ball. He sees parallels between the quality and balance of that squad and Aidy Boothroyd\u2019s Under\u201121s here in Italy but believes success at the Euros represents a more formidable challenge. \u201cI\u2019m sure it will be even harder to win this tournament because there are stronger teams and a lot of better players,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m excited to get going and see how it goes. There are better players who are a lot older and more experienced so it will be harder [than the Under-17s World Cup]. \u201cTo win takes a lot of heart and desire, especially when you get into the later stages and you\u2019re playing the same team, but you haven\u2019t got the legs. You\u2019ve just got to use your mind and heart and pull through it. A lot of heart and determination have to be used.\u201d Foden enters the Euros, that start for England against France in Cesena on Tuesday, with a billing as one of the potential stand-out players of the tournament. Increasing recognition and success make it virtually impossible for the lad from Stockport to experience a normal teenage life, a prospect even more remote after he became a father this year. Football and fishing are his escapes. \u201cIt\u2019s quite hard to lead a normal life,\u201d he says. \u201cFor example, even when I go shopping I am going to get stopped for a picture. I don\u2019t mind that. People are always watching you. It\u2019s what happens. I was walking down the road after one of my first games and people were asking for a picture. From that moment I knew it was going to be hard. \u201cI go fishing with my dad when I have a bit of free time; it\u2019s relaxing. No one is going to mither you on a quiet pond. I\u2019ve always done it.\u201d His biggest catch? \u201cI think it was a catfish, 136lb,\u201d he says. \u201cIt took three of us to get it in. That\u2019s not in the trophy cabinet.\u201d",

But since the party\u2019s disastrous showing in the European elections, when it came third behind the Brexit party and the Liberal Democrats on14% of the vote, pressure has been mounting for a decisive move towards backing a second referendum. As well as Watson from the social democratic wing of the party, and leftwing MPs such as Clive Lewis and Lloyd Russell-Moyle from campaign group Love Socialism Hate Brexit, the leadership faces a grassroots rebellion on the issue. There is a vigorous campaign for constituency Labour parties (CLPs) to pass motions demanding that Labour call for a referendum and back remain \u2013 which could be debated at party conference in the autumn. Some recent polls of Westminster voting intentions have shown Labour trailing behind the Lib Dems, whose forthright \u201cbollocks to Brexit\u201d message has helped them win over pro-remain voters from both the main parties. Corbyn made a minor but significant shift in the aftermath of the vote, saying Labour would now support \u201ca public vote on any deal\u201d \u2013 but he later said the prospect of a referendum was \u201csome way off\u201d. When the shadow cabinet meeting is rescheduled, Watson is likely to be supported by the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, and the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry. Starmer told Labour members in an online discussion last week: \u201cThere are many in the Labour party who feel we need to be very clear about a second referendum and about making the case for remain.

Until recently, Corbyn could generally count on a majority against a referendum at shadow cabinet, but some leftwing shadow ministers who have previously been wary have edged towards backing the idea in certain circumstances, the Guardian understands, including the shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, and the acting shadow international development secretary, Dan Carden.

NHS staff will be encouraged to take suicide prevention training, and there will be updated professional guidance for social workers to oblige them to take relevant training. \u201cWe should never accept a rise in mental health problems as inevitable,\u201d May will say, calling failures in the treatment of mental illness one of the \u201cburning injustices\u201d she promised to fight when she arrived in Downing Street. \u201cIt\u2019s time to rethink how we tackle this issue, which is why I believe the next great revolution in mental health should be in prevention.\u201d The measures will be funded from a long-term increase in NHS spending announced by the prime minister last year: the government had already said spending on mental health would increase more rapidly than the overall health service budget. May will also commit to overhauling the Mental Health Act, including by legislating against the the use of police cells to detain people experiencing a mental health crisis. Sir Simon Wessely, who carried out a government-commissioned review of the act that was published last December, said: \u201cThe recommendations of the review of mental health legislation that she commissioned have been warmly welcomed from all sides but now need to be acted on. Today\u2019s announcements are a further welcome step towards that goal.\u201d However, Labour said the package fell well short of the significant increase in funding for treatment that was necessary. Barbara Keeley, the shadow minister for mental health, said: \u201cThe prime minister is failing to address the real crisis. Training for teachers and other professionals is welcome but when we know thousands of children and young people are either turned away from mental health services or have to wait too long for treatment, it\u2019s clear that she\u2019s missing the real issue. \u201cThis Tory government has cut local authority funding and failed to protect mental health budgets. Labour will invest more in mental health services and ring-fence budgets so that funding reaches those who need support,\u201d Keeley said. Last week, May announced the government would legislate for a carbon emissions target of net zero by 2050, as she seeks to bind her successor into a series of modernising policies. She has also suggested that student maintenance grants should be restored. But Philip Hammond has been keen to avoid signing off on any costly announcements, as the Treasury prepares for a spending review under a new prime minister \u2013 and almost certainly a new chancellor \u2013 in the autumn. The news comes as the Children\u2019s Society reports that as many as 106,000 10- to 17-year-olds a year with mental health problems are being denied care because specialist NHS services in England judge them to be not ill enough to need it. Only 79,000 of the 185,000 who seek help get it, the charity claims in a study. The use of \u201cthresholds\u201d to decide which troubled children get treatment is unwise because young people who miss out are more likely to end up in crisis, it adds. Almost one in three (32%) of parents of children aged four to 17 say their child has been affected by a mental health issue in the last year, the charity found in a survey of 1,004 self-selecting parents.",

He also criticised their \u201cmachismo\u201d, saying:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The fundamental issue here is there is a competition of machismo. Everyone is saying \u2018I\u2019m tougher\u2019. Every time I have this debate everyone is like, \u2018trust me, I\u2019m the guy, I can defeat the impossible odds\u2019. And I\u2019m accused of being a defeatist by trying to be realistic. It reminds me of trying to cram a whole series of rubbish bags into the rubbish bin \u2026 I was tempted to say believe in the bin, believe in Britain. It\u2019s nonsense.</p> </blockquote> <p>All four other candidates on the stage - Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Sajid Javid and Dominic Raab - are willing to contemplate a no-deal Brexit as an option (although they would all prefer to strike a deal) and Stewart argued this was foolish. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A no-deal Brexit is a complete nonsense. It is going to deeply damage our economy.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Dominic Raab</strong>, the most hardline Brexiter on the platform, was strongly criticised by all other candidates for his refusal to rule out proroguing parliament if necessary to stop MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit. This position (which is reportedly shared by Johnson) was described as undemocratic by the other candidates. <strong>Sajid Javid </strong>said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are not selecting a dictator of this country. We are choosing a prime minister of this country \u2026 You don\u2019t deliver on democracy by trashing democracy.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Jeremy Hunt criticised Johnson directly for not turning up for the debate.</strong> At one point, referring to the empty podium used by Channel 4 to highlight Johnson\u2019s non-appearance, he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I just want to say: where is Boris? If his team won\u2019t let him out to debate with five<strong> </strong>pretty friendly colleagues, how is he going to get on with 27 European colleagues? He should be here to answer that question.</p> </blockquote> <p>Generally, though, there was little comment from the panel on Johnson\u2019s decision to stay away - unlike when Theresa May refused to show up for a leaders\u2019 debate in the general election, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-lf5NJISo0\">her opponents repeatedly drew attention to her not being there.</a></p> <p>Here is my colleague <strong>Rowena Mason</strong>\u2019s take on how each candidate did during the debate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/16/who-were-the-winners-and-losers-of-the-tory-leadership-debate\">Who were the winners and losers of the Tory leadership debate?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And here is my colleague <strong>Heather Stewart</strong>\u2019s all-embracing news story.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/16/boris-johnson-rivals-vie-to-offer-their-visions-for-post-brexit-britain\">Johnson's rivals vie to offer their visions for post-Brexit Britain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s all from me for tonight.</p> <p>Thanks for the comments.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d06a7438f08532f138d2da2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-16T20:33:42.735Z\">9.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is<strong> Katy Balls</strong>\u2019s take on the debate <a href=\"https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2019/06/leadership-hopefuls-turn-on-one-another-in-channel-4-debate/\">for the Spectator\u2019s Coffee House blog.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/katyballs/status/1140354748501123072\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">No clear winner in tonight&#39;s Channel 4 debate \u2013 though one candidate has managed to get a positive result in form of an MP endorsement <a href=\"https://t.co/2gVeAirDqY\">https://t.co/2gVeAirDqY</a></p>&mdash; Katy Balls (@katyballs) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/katyballs/status/1140354748501123072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 16, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>And here is an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With [Boris] Johnson already winning the support of enough MPs to make the final two (so long as it holds), tonight\u2019s debate was really for the remaining candidate to battle it out for the second spot ahead of the next MPs\u2019 ballot on Tuesday. In that vein, there was no clear winner this evening. However, the [Rory] Stewart campaign did appear to get something good out of it. After the debate ended, Conservative MP Margot James \u2013 who had been backing Matt Hancock before he dropped out on Friday \u2013 took to social media to say that she had been so impressed by Stewart she would now back him in the leadership contest. There is a concern amongst some of the other cabinet candidate campaigns that Stewart is the one gaining momentum right now.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d06a6048f08374cc578f473\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-16T20:27:12.195Z\">9.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>From the Spectator\u2019s <strong>James Forsyth</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JGForsyth/status/1140352973664673793\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">One of the most striking things about tonight\u2019s debate was how once it moved off Brexit, the candidates agreed on nearly everything.

And indeed, trying to establish a \u201cwinner\u201d for an event like this would be difficult anyway, because the candidates were addressing three audiences - the public at large, Conservative party members, and Conservative MPs - all of whom may have come to quite separate conclusions about who did best. In short, it was not a game-changer.</p> <p>And it was not hugely productive on the news front either. (These events normally aren\u2019t; see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jun/16/channel-4-debate-tory-leadership-candidates-take-part-in-first-tv-hustings-without-boris-johnson-live-news?page=with:block-5d06709a8f08263b930f0b00#block-5d06709a8f08263b930f0b00\"> 6.01pm.) </a>We did not hear anything particularly new about Brexit and - surprisingly, given that the Conservatives are a party of government, with a need to reinvent themselves - the debate about where the party goes next rarely got beyond the platitudinous.</p> <p>Still, there were interesting exchanges for anyone following the Conservative leadership contest closely. Here is my assessment of how the candidates did, roughly in order of who I think can be judged to have done best.</p> <p><strong>Rory Stewart:</strong> There were predictions before tonight that Stewart would be like Nick Clegg in 2010 - the outsider who struck a chord with the public because he exposed the obvious failings of his more prominent opponents - and, although he probably mentioned tariff schedules once too often, he succeeded tonight in puncturing the Brexit complacency of his rivals. His repeated references to the shortcomings of machismo as strategy will have struck a chord, and people probably liked his repeated references to listening. In a poll of the public at large watching, he would probably be the clear winner. But of course the public at large won\u2019t choose the next Tory leader, and this performance won\u2019t necessarily stop him being eliminated next Tuesday, in the next ballot.</p> <p><strong>Sajid Javid: </strong>In a large debate to succeed you have to stand out and Javid\u2019s personal anecdotes - the references to being an outsider and a victim of racism, and to being the only person on the panel to have gone to a comprehensive school - would probably have gone down well with anyone looking at the Tory leadership contest afresh (ie, without having heard it all before). He also delivered some particularly strong attack lines against the Brexiters, saying that only a dictator would prorogue parliament, and that you can\u2019t beat the Brexit party by becoming the Brexit party.<br></p> <p><strong>Michael Gove:</strong> Gove is competing to beat Jeremy Hunt to be on the final ballot against Boris Johnson and his references to how well he can perform in the Commons, which may have sounded like self-glorification to ordinary viewers, may have made an impression on Tory MPs who take this stuff seriously. At times Gove sounded shouty and pompous (eg, his line about he will be able to deliver Brexit because he can succeed against \u201cimpossible odds\u201d), but he was a strong presence in the debate, extremely eloquent as usual, and perhaps some viewers will have liked his \u201clove and hope\u201d answer on knife crime, which sounded like David Cameron in his \u201chug a hoodie\u201d days (it worked for him).</p> <p><strong>Jeremy Hunt: </strong>Hunt probably made the fewest mistakes. He came over as less hubristic than his main rival, Gove, and he was the first candidate to take a direct hit at Boris Johnson for not showing up. But he did not stamp his personality on the proceedings, and anyone watching this who had not been following the news would not have guessed that, of the people on stage, he is currently the candidate doing best.</p> <p><strong>Dominic Raab:</strong> Raab is standing as the only person guaranteeing to deliver Brexit by 31 October. This may be a selling point with the parliamentary party, although with that audience he has lost out to Boris Johnson for the Brexiter voter, and with members of the public watching tonight, he probably did not come out best in the exchanges over the rights and wrong of proroguing parliament. It was Raab against the other four, and their argument - that suspending parliament would be wrong - was more persuasive, and more passionately expressed.</p> <p><strong>Boris Johnson:</strong> He comes last, obviously, because he did not show up. But will that damage his standing in the long run? Yes, if he continues to dodge media exposure. But he is taking part in a rival, BBC debate on Tuesday, and that may go some way towards neutralising the \u201cchicken\u201d attacks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3a5971e72c01ad8f58ed26589ec4af3e8879154\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3a5971e72c01ad8f58ed26589ec4af3e8879154/0_78_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Raab (left) and Rory Stewart during the live Channel 4 debate.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic Raab (left) and Rory Stewart during the live Channel 4 debate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Anderson/Channel 4/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-16T21:00:23.409Z\">at 10.00pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d0691818f08374cc578f3ff\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-16T19:01:27.010Z\">8.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is the first take story from the Press Association on the debate.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Rival Tory leadership contenders have turned on Dominic Raab after he refused to rule out suspending parliament to push through Brexit by the end of October. </p> <p>In the first televised debate of the campaign, the five candidates taking part all agreed the next prime minister had to take Britain out of the EU. </p> <p>But there were sharp differences as to how that could be achieved. </p> <p>Channel 4, which staged the debate, put an empty podium for frontrunner Boris Johnson who refused to take part. </p> <p>He was taunted about his absence by Foreign Secretary <strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong> who said it raised questions about his ability to take on the job of prime minister. </p> <p>\u201cWhere is Boris?

And welcome to our blog covering the first televised hustings of the Conservative leadership contest. Five of the six candidates still in the race - Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Dominic Raab, Sajid Javid and Rory Stewart - will be taking part. As you all must know, because his reluctance to face media scrutiny is becoming a major part of the narrative of the contest, Boris Johnson, the clear favourite, has said he will be staying away.</p> <p>What are we going to find out? Well, perhaps not very much, because televised debates often have much less impact on political campaigns than people assume they will. What matters over the next week is how 313 MPs vote (because they still have to whittle the field down to two, for the ballot of party members) and, because MPs know all these candidates well, they are unlikely to be influenced much by what any of them say tonight. But debates can make a difference because they can produce one, or all, of the following three things.</p> <p><strong>1) A winner?</strong> More often than not after a debate like this supporters of X believe X did best, supporters of Y think Y did best, and people who are neutral are divided or unsure. But sometimes there is an obvious winner - for example, Nick Clegg in the first debate of the 2010 general election.</p> <p><strong>2) A story? </strong>Televised debates are always a story. But that does not always mean they always produce a story - a candidate saying something interesting and new, or some other defining event. But we always live in hope.</p> <p><strong>3) A defining moment? </strong>This could be the answer or exchange that produces a winner or a story, but sometimes what gets said in a debate can end up being a defining moment even though it does not seem so at the time. This happened in the 2015 general election Question Time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/30/question-time-leaders-cameron-miliband-clegg-election\">when Ed Miliband was asked if the last government had overspent, and he said no.</a> It was a version of an answer he had given many times before. But the clarity of the exchange meant it crystallised a concern that many voters had about Labour, and later it was seen as hugely damaging.</p> <p>It is also the case that debates are a good way of allowing people to evaluate politicians. In his classic 1990s book about politics, Ruling Britannia, <strong>Andrew Marr</strong> explains why seeing politicians being interviewed on television is so important.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Television is very good at telling the voter certain things about a politician or other interviewee, One can read the facing tics and expressions that suggest tension, lying, anger and so forth. One can make a personal judgment about an individual minister or leader in a way that earlier generations never could, unless they were part of the privileged political elite. If before, one could read X\u2019s speech given verbatim in The Times, and treat X solely on the basis of his language and arguments, now one can concluded that X\u2019s grandson, the new minister, is a sanctimonious creep. And in the real world, the fact that \u2018X is a creep\u2019 is a valid personal assessment and matters to most of just as much as his speechifying.</p> </blockquote> <p>All of this is even more true of televised leadership debates, which involve leading politicians having to engage with each other in a way that does not normally happen in the Commons or on TV.</p> <p>The Channel 4 hustings starts at 6.30pm.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/krishgm/status/1140284340666011648\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Join <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DominicRaab?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@DominicRaab</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RoryStewartUK?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@RoryStewartUK</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jeremy_Hunt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Jeremy_Hunt</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sajidjavid?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@sajidjavid</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/michaelgove?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@michaelgove</a> with open invitation for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BorisJohnson</a> on the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/C4Debate?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#C4Debate</a> live at 6.30pm on Channel 4. <a href=\"https://t.co/9rg4gqD0Bl\">pic.twitter.com/9rg4gqD0Bl</a></p>&mdash; Krishnan Guru-Murthy (@krishgm) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/krishgm/status/1140284340666011648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 16, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow\">@AndrewSparrow</a>.</p> <p>I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all.

      "bodyText": "Five of the six remaining candidates for the Conservative leadership have clashed for the first time in a televised debate. Boris Johnson, the clear favourite, stayed away, and the 90-minute hustings - which were lively, but mostly good-tempered - were dominated by Brexit, allowing Rory Stewart, the international development secretary and been running an outside/insurgency campaign, to stand out by repeatedly criticising his opponents for making unrealistic promises about being able to renegotiate Brexit. He also criticised their \u201cmachismo\u201d, saying: The fundamental issue here is there is a competition of machismo. Everyone is saying \u2018I\u2019m tougher\u2019. Every time I have this debate everyone is like, \u2018trust me, I\u2019m the guy, I can defeat the impossible odds\u2019. And I\u2019m accused of being a defeatist by trying to be realistic. It reminds me of trying to cram a whole series of rubbish bags into the rubbish bin \u2026 I was tempted to say believe in the bin, believe in Britain. It\u2019s nonsense. All four other candidates on the stage - Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Sajid Javid and Dominic Raab - are willing to contemplate a no-deal Brexit as an option (although they would all prefer to strike a deal) and Stewart argued this was foolish. He said: A no-deal Brexit is a complete nonsense. It is going to deeply damage our economy. Dominic Raab, the most hardline Brexiter on the platform, was strongly criticised by all other candidates for his refusal to rule out proroguing parliament if necessary to stop MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit. This position (which is reportedly shared by Johnson) was described as undemocratic by the other candidates. Sajid Javid said: We are not selecting a dictator of this country. We are choosing a prime minister of this country \u2026 You don\u2019t deliver on democracy by trashing democracy. Jeremy Hunt criticised Johnson directly for not turning up for the debate. At one point, referring to the empty podium used by Channel 4 to highlight Johnson\u2019s non-appearance, he said: I just want to say: where is Boris? If his team won\u2019t let him out to debate with five pretty friendly colleagues, how is he going to get on with 27 European colleagues? He should be here to answer that question. Generally, though, there was little comment from the panel on Johnson\u2019s decision to stay away - unlike when Theresa May refused to show up for a leaders\u2019 debate in the general election, and her opponents repeatedly drew attention to her not being there. Here is my colleague Rowena Mason\u2019s take on how each candidate did during the debate. And here is my colleague Heather Stewart\u2019s all-embracing news story. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. Here is Katy Balls\u2019s take on the debate for the Spectator\u2019s Coffee House blog. And here is an extract. With [Boris] Johnson already winning the support of enough MPs to make the final two (so long as it holds), tonight\u2019s debate was really for the remaining candidate to battle it out for the second spot ahead of the next MPs\u2019 ballot on Tuesday. In that vein, there was no clear winner this evening. However, the [Rory] Stewart campaign did appear to get something good out of it. After the debate ended, Conservative MP Margot James \u2013 who had been backing Matt Hancock before he dropped out on Friday \u2013 took to social media to say that she had been so impressed by Stewart she would now back him in the leadership contest. There is a concern amongst some of the other cabinet candidate campaigns that Stewart is the one gaining momentum right now. From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth Here is Margot James, the culture minister, endorsing Rory Stewart after tonight\u2019s debate. Here is my colleague Rowena Mason\u2019s take on who did best and worst in the debate this evening. (We agree on who came \u201ctop\u201d and \u201cbottom\u201d, but her take on the mid-ranking performers is a bit different from mine. Which is no bad thing. These are subjective judgments, and it would be a bit worrying if we all thought the same.) And this is what political journalists are saying about the debate on Twitter. No one seems to think this will change much, although Rory Stewart may have won the Twitter vote. That won\u2019t necessarily help him. As David Cameron said after he won the 2015 general election, despite social media coming out for Labour, \u201cBritain and Twitter are not the same thing\u201d. That is even more true of the Conservative party and Twitter. A thread from Sky\u2019s Sam Coates A blog from the New Statesman\u2019s Patrick Maguire And here\u2019s an extract Meeting the 33 MP quota required for the third ballot will mean [Rory Stewart] almost doubling his first round result and the balance of probabilities is still stacked against him. But tonight\u2019s debate had no clear winner. That is bad news for the bigger cabinet names and good news for Stewart. Having won the endorsement of defence minister Tobias Ellwood this morning - one of Matt Hancock\u2019s 19 supporters - Stewart\u2019s hope was that more would follow. His disruptive presence on stage this evening boosts the chances of such a windfall: as shown by the post-match endorsement of Margot James, another minister who backed Hancock in the first round. From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn From ITV\u2019s Paul Brand From my colleague Dan Sabbagh From Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall From Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby From my colleague Heather Stewart From the broadcaster Gavin Hewitt From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth From the Times\u2019 Patrick Kidd From the Telegraph\u2019s Christopher Hope From PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield That did not feel like a debate with a clear winner. And indeed, trying to establish a \u201cwinner\u201d for an event like this would be difficult anyway, because the candidates were addressing three audiences - the public at large, Conservative party members, and Conservative MPs - all of whom may have come to quite separate conclusions about who did best. In short, it was not a game-changer. And it was not hugely productive on the news front either. (These events normally aren\u2019t; see 6.01pm.) We did not hear anything particularly new about Brexit and - surprisingly, given that the Conservatives are a party of government, with a need to reinvent themselves - the debate about where the party goes next rarely got beyond the platitudinous. Still, there were interesting exchanges for anyone following the Conservative leadership contest closely. Here is my assessment of how the candidates did, roughly in order of who I think can be judged to have done best. Rory Stewart: There were predictions before tonight that Stewart would be like Nick Clegg in 2010 - the outsider who struck a chord with the public because he exposed the obvious failings of his more prominent opponents - and, although he probably mentioned tariff schedules once too often, he succeeded tonight in puncturing the Brexit complacency of his rivals. His repeated references to the shortcomings of machismo as strategy will have struck a chord, and people probably liked his repeated references to listening. In a poll of the public at large watching, he would probably be the clear winner. But of course the public at large won\u2019t choose the next Tory leader, and this performance won\u2019t necessarily stop him being eliminated next Tuesday, in the next ballot. Sajid Javid: In a large debate to succeed you have to stand out and Javid\u2019s personal anecdotes - the references to being an outsider and a victim of racism, and to being the only person on the panel to have gone to a comprehensive school - would probably have gone down well with anyone looking at the Tory leadership contest afresh (ie, without having heard it all before). He also delivered some particularly strong attack lines against the Brexiters, saying that only a dictator would prorogue parliament, and that you can\u2019t beat the Brexit party by becoming the Brexit party. Michael Gove: Gove is competing to beat Jeremy Hunt to be on the final ballot against Boris Johnson and his references to how well he can perform in the Commons, which may have sounded like self-glorification to ordinary viewers, may have made an impression on Tory MPs who take this stuff seriously. At times Gove sounded shouty and pompous (eg, his line about he will be able to deliver Brexit because he can succeed against \u201cimpossible odds\u201d), but he was a strong presence in the debate, extremely eloquent as usual, and perhaps some viewers will have liked his \u201clove and hope\u201d answer on knife crime, which sounded like David Cameron in his \u201chug a hoodie\u201d days (it worked for him). Jeremy Hunt: Hunt probably made the fewest mistakes. He came over as less hubristic than his main rival, Gove, and he was the first candidate to take a direct hit at Boris Johnson for not showing up. But he did not stamp his personality on the proceedings, and anyone watching this who had not been following the news would not have guessed that, of the people on stage, he is currently the candidate doing best. Dominic Raab: Raab is standing as the only person guaranteeing to deliver Brexit by 31 October. This may be a selling point with the parliamentary party, although with that audience he has lost out to Boris Johnson for the Brexiter voter, and with members of the public watching tonight, he probably did not come out best in the exchanges over the rights and wrong of proroguing parliament. It was Raab against the other four, and their argument - that suspending parliament would be wrong - was more persuasive, and more passionately expressed. Boris Johnson: He comes last, obviously, because he did not show up. But will that damage his standing in the long run? Yes, if he continues to dodge media exposure. But he is taking part in a rival, BBC debate on Tuesday, and that may go some way towards neutralising the \u201cchicken\u201d attacks. Here is the first take story from the Press Association on the debate. Rival Tory leadership contenders have turned on Dominic Raab after he refused to rule out suspending parliament to push through Brexit by the end of October. In the first televised debate of the campaign, the five candidates taking part all agreed the next prime minister had to take Britain out of the EU. But there were sharp differences as to how that could be achieved. Channel 4, which staged the debate, put an empty podium for frontrunner Boris Johnson who refused to take part. He was taunted about his absence by Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt who said it raised questions about his ability to take on the job of prime minister. \u201cWhere is Boris? If his team won\u2019t allow him out with five fairly friendly colleagues, how is is he going to deal with 27 European countries?\u201d he said. The sharpest early exchanges were however dominated by Dominic Raab\u2019s insistence the option of proroguing Parliament should remain on the table. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is likely but it is not illegal,\u201d he said. \u201cThe moment that we telegraph to the EU we are not willing to walk away at the end of October we take away our best shot of a deal.\u201d International Development Secretary Rory Stewart said shutting down parliament was \u201cundemocratic\u201d and \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d and would not work. \u201cParliament is not a building. parliament is our democratic representatives and they will meet regardless of what the prime minister wants,\u201d he said to applause from the studio audience. Hunt said it was the \u201cwrong thing to do\u201d while Home Secretary Sajid Javid said: \u201cYou don\u2019t deliver democracy by trashing democracy. We are not selecting a dictator.\u201d Raab warned that parliament could not stop a determined prime minister, saying: \u201cIt is near impossible to stop a government that is serious.\u201d That drew a sharp retort from Environment Secretary Michael Gove who told him: \u201cI will defend our democracy. \u201cYou cannot take Britain out of the EU against the will of parliament.\u201d Each candidate has 30 seconds to make a closing staement. Gove says these are serious times. We need someone as PM who has been tested and who has proved he can deliver. I am ready to unite, ready to deliver, ready to lead. Hunt says the country is in peril. Labour is planning a Venezuelan or Cuban Britain. He is an entrepreneur and he can deliver, unlocking the dynamism in this country. Stewart says he has travelled the country and heard the anger of voters. He stared a 100/1 outsider. He is now second in the odds. But he is still an outside. He says he should be in the final two, ot make Britain a country founded in \u201chonesty and trust\u201d. Javid says the Tories need to show they do not just tolerate modern Britain, but embrace it. He wants to lead the UK through Brexit and beyond. Raab says he is the only candidate committed to deliver Brexit by 31 October come what may. And that\u2019s it. The debate is over. I will be posting a snap verdict, reaction and a summary. Gove says he knows about autism, because someone close to him has the condition. And he says he has a sister with a disability. (She is deaf.) Stewart says he agrees with Raab. We need to focus more on prevention, he says. He says if any of them become prime minister - and he hopes it is one of them that becomes prime minister - they will address this, he says. Stewart suggests any of the other candidates would be a better prime minister than Boris Johnson. Q: How would you get rid of the postcode lottery for people with invisible disabilities, like my son, who has autism. Hunt says the government needs to do more for people with mental health problems. And people with autism are more likly to have mental health problems, he says. Raab says the state needs to pick problems like this up earlier. Prevention is better than cure, he says. Javid says we have become better at picking up these problems, but we need to do more, especially for children with special needs. Javid says he is stubborn. It takes him a long time to change his mind. It took him 10 years to agree to get a family dog, Bailey (star of his campaign video.) Q: Isn\u2019t the problem that you are not a big enough figure? You weren\u2019t a big enough figure to get invited to the Trump dinner. Hunt and Gove both protest about the question, with Gove saying it was ridiculous. Gove says Saj does not need Donald Trump to tell him his is a big figure. Hunt says: My friends would say I\u2019m someone who looks gentle but is incredibly stubborn underneath. Stewart says he has learnt a lot in this campaign about his weaknesses. We should not just have leaders who posture, he says. We need leaders who listen. He says he speaks to people in tech, and they know more about it than he does. Q: Is it a weakness to change your mind? You seem to do it a lot. Stewart says he thinks, and he changes his mind. I think that\u2019s part of the business of being frail. I think that\u2019s part of the business of being human. Raab says he is restless for change. He mentions mentoring a lad at boxing club. He says we need restless optimism. Q: What do you say to people who think your biggest weakness is thinking feminists are bigots. Raab says he should not be judged by something he said a long time ago that has been taken out of context. He was making a point about an equal attitude to discrimination. He is the only candidate calling for pregnant women to be routinely offered a third scan, he says. Q: Rory Stewart has spoken of the wisdom of humility. What is our greatest weakness? Impatience, says Gove. He is a man in a hurry. He wants every child to have the best start. And we need to \u201csuper-charge\u201d reform of adult social care. Guru-Murthy says Gove is supposed to be talking about his weaknesses. Gove says he is talking about impatience. Q: Isn\u2019t your weakness hypocrisy, as the drug-taking revelation showed? No, says Gove. We all make mistakes. If you make a mistake, you should learn from his mistake. One reason he is in public life is to help people who have made mistakes. Hunt says everyone on the stage did things 25 years ago they would not want their parents to know about. He says, with the country facing Brexit, we should not be trivialising the debate by talking about issues like this. This is from the Conservative MP Sir Nicholas Soames. Gove says the government\u2019s approach to knife crime should not be about law and order. \u201cIt should be about love and hope.\u201d Stewart says there are 10,000 things he would like people to do together if he becomes PM. He mentions three. First, preparing for technological change and AI. Guru-Murthy says he was asked for just one priority. Stewart says it would be better social care. It\u2019s a real disgrace, it\u2019s the great unfinished revolution of our society. Javid says public services would be his priority. He relied on public services to get where he is now. He was the only person on the stage to go to a comprehensive school. He went to a college, a technical one, not the one Stewart went to (Eton College, then Balliol College at Oxford.) Q: What is the most important thing you would do apart from Brexit? Raab says he would boost apprenticeships. Hunt says he wants to do more on social care. His grandmother died at the age of 100. Everyone should be able to die with dignity. That does not happen at the moment. He says social care is unfinished business. Gove says children are his top priority. He says there needs to be more technical education. And some of the jobs being done now will disappear. So the government must allow people to retrain mid-career. Javid says he knows what it is like to be an outsider. He says it is important to show anyone can be PM. Hunt says he is committed to keeping the UK together. Before he was involved in Brexit, he was involved in the campaign to keep the UK together. (That is a reference to his unusual cairn campaign in 2014.) Hunt says this is the fundamental question for the party. Do they choose a path that unites the country or divides it. He says Javid spoke movingly about this. But Hunt says he wants to make a different point. It is important to consider the young, he says. They have to unite generations, and recognise that it is much, much harder for the young to buy a house than in the past. He says a quarter of primary school pupils cannot read or write properly when they leave. The Tories should be the party that abolishes illiteracy, he says. Gove says he agrees with Hunt. The country needs to come together. The party needs to value everyone. He has always believed there is \u201ca treasure in the heart of every individual\u201d, he says. He says that many of those who voted for Brexit come from communities that are undervalued and families that are overlooked. From what happened to his father\u2019s business, he knows what it is to see a dream die, he says. Q: How will you reunite a divided country? Javid says this is the third anniversary of the murder of Jo Cox. One of her big ideas is that there is more than unites us than divides us. He says he gets attacked personally. It is important to have a cohesive society, he says. He says having a different messenger will help bring people together. Raab says the Tories have to show they can do more than Brexit. He would show the party is on the side of the low paid by cutting taxes. He would boost apprenticeships. And he would have a fairer economy and a fairer society. Javid says: You don\u2019t beat the Brexit party by becoming the Brexit party. Stewart says he rejects no-deal. He believes in a country that says yes: yes to trade, and yes to a deal. Hunt says we need a Brexit that can work for the 48% of people who voted remain, as well as for the people who voted leave. He wants to show the UK is a tolerant country. That is another reason to reject Farage. Javid says all candidates should unite behind whoever wins. But it is the job of the government to deliver on Brexit. Farage is not part of the government, he says. Raab says the Tories can put the Brexit party out of business by delivering Brexit. Hunt says Farage stands for more than Brexit. He wants a WTO Brexit, ie no-deal. He says the Conservative party is the party of business. It will be nothing if it cannot champion business. No-deal should not be the Tories\u2019 first choice. But it is Farage\u2019s first choice. Q: Would any of you use Nigel Farage in Brexit negotiations? Stewart says he debated Nigel Farage on LBC this morning. He would be happy to talk to him about Brexit. And he would talk to people like the unions too. He says: I think a no-deal Brexit is a complete nonsense. He says all the other candidates have just admitted it would be hugely damaging to the country. So it is not realistic, he says. Raab says Stewart is talking down the economy. Stewart says Raab is going back to machismo, and \u201cbelief in the bin\u201d. He asks Raab what the tariffs on cheddar would be under Raab\u2019s deal. Raab says he would try to get a deal, by going back to the Malthouse compromise. Raab says, if he were prime minister, he would have an emergency budget involving tax cuts to prepare the country for no-deal. Raab says he would prepare for no-deal by passing tax cuts in an emergency budget. Q: As the traditional party of business, how can you contemplate a no-deal Brexit? Hunt starts with an attack on Boris Johnson for not showing up. If he cannot handle five quite friendly colleagues, how will he be able to handle the EU 27. Hunt says he has experience as a negotiator. If were were close to a deal at the end of October, it would be wrong to leave without a deal. He says he thinks he is the business person who can negotiate a deal. Q: What would no-deal mean for farmers and for Northern Ireland? Gove says he is the candidate with most experience of planning for no-deal. He says no-deal would cause turbulence. But the UK could get through it. He says he knows what a deal would look like. Stewart asks what this deal will look like. What will the tariff schedule be? Gove says, if there is a deal, there will be no tariffs. He will ensure the backstop is temporary. Q: How? They\u2019ve said no. They would say no, says Gove. In any negotiation each side hangs tough. He says in government, faced with a difficult job, he has shown he can deliver. Q: Why would they deliver a deal for you when they did not for Theresa May? Because I have shown in government that my conviction can carry me through. And I\u2019ve taken on impossible odds. Gove claims he can deliver Brexit because in the past he has shown he can succeed against \u201cimpossible odds\u201d. Gove says he understands why people are frustrated. But he backed Brexit to empower our democracy. He says shutting the doors of parliament would be wrong. We must defend our democracy. Q: So what would you do? Gove says there are two types of democracy: Raab\u2019s, because he would suspend parliament to get no-deal through; and Stewart\u2019s, because he does not think the UK can get a bette deal. Gove says one of the problems is that people in government have not believed in Brexit. He does believe in Brexit, he says. I\u2019m saying I can get the European Union to change their approach. Gove tells Raab the UK cannot leave unless parliament votes for it. Raab tries to say Gove would undermine his negotiating stance, but Gove talks over him, saying you cannot suspend democracy. Stewart says everyone is trying to show how \u201cmachismo\u201d can solve this. I\u2019m accused of being a defeatist by being realistic about this. But wishful-thinking won\u2019t work, he says. He says he tried recently to stuff three bin bags in a bin that was full. He tried the \u2018believe in the bin bag\u2019 approach. But it did not work. The bin was full. Javid says Stewart is not being realistic either, because he wants to invite 50,000 people to come up with a solution to Brexit. Hunt says proroguing parliament to deliver no-deal would be wrong. Javid agrees with Hunt. You don\u2019t deliver democracy by trashing democracy. We are not selecting a dictator of our democracy. We are selecting a prime minister of our democracy. Javid suggests only a \u201cdictator\u201d would want to prorogue parliament to deliver no-deal. Q: What are your views on suspending (proroguing) parliament? And if you don\u2019t suspend parliament, how will you deal with this impasse? Raab says there is no need to suspend parliament. Leaving in October is default. But every time you rule out suspending parliament, you weaken the UK\u2019s negotiating stance, he says. Q: Are you willing to do it? Raab says he does not think this is likely. But it would not be illegal. Stewart says Raab knows there is no way of getting his Brexit deal unless he suspends parliament. That\u2019s \u201cnonsense\u201d, says Raab. He says Stewart wants a people\u2019s assembly, the Venezuelan option. Stewart says Tony Blair tried to do this in 2002. But MPs threatened to meet in Church House, and Blair backed down. (That is not quite true. The issue in 2002 was about whether to recall parliament early, not prorogation.) Gove says he put everything on the line for Brexit - including friends. He says in three cabinet jobs he has shown he can deliver. And he is the candidate who will frighten Corbyn. When Jeremy Corbyn wakes up before Question Time, who is the person he will be most terrified of facing? That\u2019s me. Gove says he is the candidate who will most frighten Corbyn at PMQs. He says he is personally committed to delivering Brexit because of what happened to his father\u2019s fish business. Jeremy Hunt says this is the most important question of the evening. The Tories have to deliver Brexit. But defeating Corbyn involves having a leader the public can trust. Hunt says he set up his own business. Corbyn does not support people like that. Corbyn is against British values and against Britain, he says. He says Theresa May did extremely well in the last election to get 41% of the vote. But she did not get a majority. May got the Brexit vote. But the Tories will only win a majority if they reach out to the centre ground. We will only get a majority if we reach out to the centre ground. Raab says it is a matter of trust. The key thing is to deliver Brexit. Stewart says he hopes they will come back to Brexit, because he has questions about Raab\u2019s approach. Q: They all says they can renegotiate Brexit. Do you agree? No, says Stewart. He says his question to Raab is how he will take the UK out of the EU. There has been talk of suspending parliament. What happens if Corbyn tries to do this? Raab says parliament has just voted against taking no-deal off the table. He says it is wrong to take an option off the table in a negotiation. Sajid Javid says you have to deliver Brexit. But that does not just mean leaving the EU. It means addressing the concerns that led to the leave vote. And the messenger matters as much as the message, he says. Rory Stewart says he has spoken to voters. People do not want to vote for Corbyn, he says. He says action must come from realism. Dominic Raab says you have to deliver Brexit. Then you can do things like cut taxes, that Corbyn cannot do. Q: How do you intend to win against Corbyn and Farage? Michael Gove says there is nothing more important than beating Corbyn. He says he took Corbyn apart in the 10-minute speech he gave in the no confidence debate earlier this year. And, to remove the threat from Farage, you have to deliver Brexit. Gove says he can because he lead the leave campaign. Guru-Murthy is now introducing the candidates. He says one lectern is empty. That is because Boris Johnson declined to take part. But he is welcome to join at any time, says Guru-Murthy. Guru-Murthy says the audience will ask the questions, and he will ask follow-ups. Guru-Murthy says the next Tory leader has to lift the party from the pitiful 9% it got in the European elections. And he - and the next leader will be a he - has to have ideas beyond Brexit. He says the audience tonight are all people who say they are open to the idea of voting Conservative. The debate is starting. Krishnan Guru-Murthy is hosting. Channel 4 are \u201cempty podiuming\u201d Boris Johnson. This is not something that broadcasters usually do when a candidate refuses to accept an invitation to take part in a debate, normally because it is seen as a hostile act (and broadcasters are meant to be impartial). It will highlight Johnson\u2019s refusal to turn up. But the Sun\u2019s Steve Hawkes thinks it might look a bit silly. Some of the candidates have been tweeting. I\u2019m sorry the comments aren\u2019t open yet. There seems to be a technical problem. We are trying to get that fixed, and hopefully they will open soon. According to the Press Association, Dominic Raab declined to answer questions as he arrived for the Channel 4 Tory leadership debate in east London. Rory Stewart said he was \u201clooking forward\u201d to the debate. Asked about Boris Johnson\u2019s non-appearance at the debate, Stewart said: We\u2019re choosing a prime minister and the public has the right to hear from us and judge who had the qualities to be prime minister. Stewart said he was hoping to discuss \u201cwhat we can achieve after Brexit, the way we can make this country fairer, greener, and more united\u201d during the live debate. Michael Gove said he was \u201clooking forward to a positive exchange\u201d as he arrive. Jeremy Hunt and Sajid Javid were driven in to the debate venue via a back entrance and did not stop for journalists\u2019 questions. Good evening. And welcome to our blog covering the first televised hustings of the Conservative leadership contest. Five of the six candidates still in the race - Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Dominic Raab, Sajid Javid and Rory Stewart - will be taking part. As you all must know, because his reluctance to face media scrutiny is becoming a major part of the narrative of the contest, Boris Johnson, the clear favourite, has said he will be staying away. What are we going to find out? Well, perhaps not very much, because televised debates often have much less impact on political campaigns than people assume they will. What matters over the next week is how 313 MPs vote (because they still have to whittle the field down to two, for the ballot of party members) and, because MPs know all these candidates well, they are unlikely to be influenced much by what any of them say tonight. But debates can make a difference because they can produce one, or all, of the following three things. 1) A winner? More often than not after a debate like this supporters of X believe X did best, supporters of Y think Y did best, and people who are neutral are divided or unsure. But sometimes there is an obvious winner - for example, Nick Clegg in the first debate of the 2010 general election. 2) A story? Televised debates are always a story. But that does not always mean they always produce a story - a candidate saying something interesting and new, or some other defining event. But we always live in hope. 3) A defining moment? This could be the answer or exchange that produces a winner or a story, but sometimes what gets said in a debate can end up being a defining moment even though it does not seem so at the time. This happened in the 2015 general election Question Time when Ed Miliband was asked if the last government had overspent, and he said no. It was a version of an answer he had given many times before. But the clarity of the exchange meant it crystallised a concern that many voters had about Labour, and later it was seen as hugely damaging. It is also the case that debates are a good way of allowing people to evaluate politicians. In his classic 1990s book about politics, Ruling Britannia, Andrew Marr explains why seeing politicians being interviewed on television is so important. Television is very good at telling the voter certain things about a politician or other interviewee, One can read the facing tics and expressions that suggest tension, lying, anger and so forth. One can make a personal judgment about an individual minister or leader in a way that earlier generations never could, unless they were part of the privileged political elite. If before, one could read X\u2019s speech given verbatim in The Times, and treat X solely on the basis of his language and arguments, now one can concluded that X\u2019s grandson, the new minister, is a sanctimonious creep. And in the real world, the fact that \u2018X is a creep\u2019 is a valid personal assessment and matters to most of just as much as his speechifying. All of this is even more true of televised leadership debates, which involve leading politicians having to engage with each other in a way that does not normally happen in the Commons or on TV. The Channel 4 hustings starts at 6.30pm. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Ofmatthew is a colossal pain in the arse and has clearly been assigned to June because she fervently believes in the ideology of the republic. \u201cWe\u2019re about to take back Chicago, my mistress tells me,\u201d she simpers.</p> \n<p>June internally mutters something about \u201cpious little shits\u201d, and they disperse around the bland interior of the supermarket with its sparsely stacked shelves of canned goods and furtive women trying to catch each other\u2019s eyes. Muzak plays.</p> \n<p>We hear talk of the stand-off between the Marthas and the handmaids, establishing that until the women trust each other, there can be no revolution. This episode screams for the women to stop sitting on the fence and work together. When June puts on the drab mud-coloured dress of a Martha later on, it\u2019s symbolic as well as a good disguise.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b646f8bcdf86ebe921375deeec850cbd421fd751\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b646f8bcdf86ebe921375deeec850cbd421fd751/0_0_8256_4954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"June does a Martha.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">June goes all Martha.<br></span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elly Dassas/Hulu</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the parlour of the Lawrence house, the hunched figure of Aunt Lydia sits, silver-topped cane supporting her, asking the Lawrences how Ofjoseph is settling in. She\u2019s alive! Despite the work of Emily\u2019s knife and the dozen or so steps she hit as she fell, the woman is indestructible. Although she does look pretty battered and beaten.</p> \n<p>The switch where she suddenly turns on June and cattle-prods her in the guts betrays the torrent of anger at Lydia\u2019s core. Even the devout women are reaching breaking point as they struggle with their own subjugation while the men behave as they like. This is what happens when you try to wrestle the equality genie back into the bottle.</p> \n<p>\u201cI wonder what the voltage is on those things,\u201d says Joseph coldly as he leaves a stricken June on the stairs. We get it. He\u2019s capricious and June cannot rely on his initial kindness returning anytime soon. Later, when she puts him in danger by harbouring the injured Martha, he shows again how he is only here to help himself.</p> \n<p>It does make it quite hard to think of him as the same man who risked his life to smuggle her out just two episodes ago. Is he actually two people? Does he have a twin?</p> \n<p>June\u2019s keenness to roll her sleeves up and join the revolution is undeniable. It\u2019s (partly) why she stayed. She\u2019s a soldier now, albeit one with no actual military experience. But the woman can bury a body single-handedly. I wouldn\u2019t mess with her.</p> \n<p>\u201cCome on, Breaking Bad, let\u2019s go,\u201d she says to the Marthas, persuading them to take her with them on the next bust. \u201cStrange to finally be invisible,\u201d she says, clad in her mud-coloured smock later. The handmaids\u2019 dresses mean visibility, like \u201cblood on snow\u201d. Is that Atwood\u2019s imagery? I love it. Very Angela Carter.</p> \n<p>As tragedy unfolds and the resistance bomb-maker they tried to help returns to them with a bullet-hole in her, we see again Commander Lawrence\u2019s utter lack of compassion. I am so confused by him.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Mrs Lawrence seems to be offering June some kind of tacit alliance this week as she covers for her when she sees the blood on the wall, and again later when she is planting things in the garden. Is that the exact spot where June buried the unfortunate woman?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55165f87c8f07886033c3f30cfc4b00e5119ae15\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55165f87c8f07886033c3f30cfc4b00e5119ae15/0_63_1371_823/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Where did the nice guy go ...

Bradley Whitford as Commander Lawrence.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cDo not let this be for nothing,\u201d June urges the surviving Martha, who leaves just before Commander Lawrence arrives to find the dead woman on the basement floor. He tells June she is like a child, taking too much, then he roars at her when she asks after his wife. They really aren\u2019t friends this week at all. Where did nice Josh Lyman go?</p> \n<p>Back on the market walk, Ofmatthew is full of zeal, ranting about the disobedience of the dead woman. She is the voice of the regime this series, spouting invective about the ingratitude of women.</p> \n<p>I loved June\u2019s deadpan remark about another handmaid who died because \u201cher shopping partner snapped, pushed her under a bus\u201d, exactly at the moment the bus rolls past. Perfect comic timing.</p> \n<h2>Canada</h2> \n<p>Meanwhile, over the border, we witness the gradual healing of Emily\u2019s\u2019 broken spirit and the bonding between Luke and his wife\u2019s new baby.</p> \n<p>The two, guided and supported by Moira, both find what they need by the epsiode\u2019s end and I have a feeling it will often be the Canadian scenes this series that provide us with optimism. The links between Gilead\u2019s survivors and their counterparts over the border grow stronger.</p> \n<p>Later we see Emily getting her eyes tested. \u201cBetter? Worse?\u201d the optician keeps asking. She emerges with new glasses and a new clarity on her situation. She phones her wife.</p> \n<p>\u201cHi, it\u2019s me,\u201d she says into her clamshell phone. Her wife\u2019s car blocks the street as she takes in the voice of the ghost suddenly talking to her like no time has passed at all. And again, the little bird of hope is back, chirruping on my finger. Praise be.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"42ad171a-5e4c-40ca-bc10-8d3dbf7eaea2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n

      "bodyText": "Spoiler alert: this recap is for people watching The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, series three, on Channel 4 in the UK. Please do not add spoilers for later episodes in the series. You can find recaps for previous episodes here Gilead I never tire of those top shots of the white handmaids\u2019 bonnets, moving around like blinkered cattle. The ladies in red are all off to the market in pairs, as usual. And June is waiting for Ofmatthew, her new partner. Ofmatthew is a colossal pain in the arse and has clearly been assigned to June because she fervently believes in the ideology of the republic. \u201cWe\u2019re about to take back Chicago, my mistress tells me,\u201d she simpers. June internally mutters something about \u201cpious little shits\u201d, and they disperse around the bland interior of the supermarket with its sparsely stacked shelves of canned goods and furtive women trying to catch each other\u2019s eyes. Muzak plays. We hear talk of the stand-off between the Marthas and the handmaids, establishing that until the women trust each other, there can be no revolution. This episode screams for the women to stop sitting on the fence and work together. When June puts on the drab mud-coloured dress of a Martha later on, it\u2019s symbolic as well as a good disguise. In the parlour of the Lawrence house, the hunched figure of Aunt Lydia sits, silver-topped cane supporting her, asking the Lawrences how Ofjoseph is settling in. She\u2019s alive! Despite the work of Emily\u2019s knife and the dozen or so steps she hit as she fell, the woman is indestructible. Although she does look pretty battered and beaten. The switch where she suddenly turns on June and cattle-prods her in the guts betrays the torrent of anger at Lydia\u2019s core. Even the devout women are reaching breaking point as they struggle with their own subjugation while the men behave as they like. This is what happens when you try to wrestle the equality genie back into the bottle. \u201cI wonder what the voltage is on those things,\u201d says Joseph coldly as he leaves a stricken June on the stairs. We get it. He\u2019s capricious and June cannot rely on his initial kindness returning anytime soon. Later, when she puts him in danger by harbouring the injured Martha, he shows again how he is only here to help himself. It does make it quite hard to think of him as the same man who risked his life to smuggle her out just two episodes ago. Is he actually two people? Does he have a twin? June\u2019s keenness to roll her sleeves up and join the revolution is undeniable. It\u2019s (partly) why she stayed. She\u2019s a soldier now, albeit one with no actual military experience. But the woman can bury a body single-handedly. I wouldn\u2019t mess with her. \u201cCome on, Breaking Bad, let\u2019s go,\u201d she says to the Marthas, persuading them to take her with them on the next bust. \u201cStrange to finally be invisible,\u201d she says, clad in her mud-coloured smock later. The handmaids\u2019 dresses mean visibility, like \u201cblood on snow\u201d. Is that Atwood\u2019s imagery? I love it. Very Angela Carter. As tragedy unfolds and the resistance bomb-maker they tried to help returns to them with a bullet-hole in her, we see again Commander Lawrence\u2019s utter lack of compassion. I am so confused by him. Meanwhile, Mrs Lawrence seems to be offering June some kind of tacit alliance this week as she covers for her when she sees the blood on the wall, and again later when she is planting things in the garden. Is that the exact spot where June buried the unfortunate woman? \u201cDo not let this be for nothing,\u201d June urges the surviving Martha, who leaves just before Commander Lawrence arrives to find the dead woman on the basement floor. He tells June she is like a child, taking too much, then he roars at her when she asks after his wife. They really aren\u2019t friends this week at all. Where did nice Josh Lyman go? Back on the market walk, Ofmatthew is full of zeal, ranting about the disobedience of the dead woman. She is the voice of the regime this series, spouting invective about the ingratitude of women. I loved June\u2019s deadpan remark about another handmaid who died because \u201cher shopping partner snapped, pushed her under a bus\u201d, exactly at the moment the bus rolls past. Perfect comic timing. Canada Meanwhile, over the border, we witness the gradual healing of Emily\u2019s\u2019 broken spirit and the bonding between Luke and his wife\u2019s new baby. The two, guided and supported by Moira, both find what they need by the epsiode\u2019s end and I have a feeling it will often be the Canadian scenes this series that provide us with optimism. The links between Gilead\u2019s survivors and their counterparts over the border grow stronger. Later we see Emily getting her eyes tested. \u201cBetter? Worse?\u201d the optician keeps asking. She emerges with new glasses and a new clarity on her situation. She phones her wife. \u201cHi, it\u2019s me,\u201d she says into her clamshell phone. Her wife\u2019s car blocks the street as she takes in the voice of the ghost suddenly talking to her like no time has passed at all. And again, the little bird of hope is back, chirruping on my finger. Praise be. Under his eye What is wrong with Mrs Lawrence? Is her jumpiness the result of some hideous chemical experiment by her husband? What\u2019s left of America is still fighting the new regime but it sounds like they\u2019re about to lose Chicago. At what point do other countries get involved? Is the special relationship over? That burial scene near the end was incredibly powerful. This woman is now so inured to pain and abuse that she can do impossible things.",

Top stories The Coalition\u2019s plan to flatten tax brackets for middle- to high-income earners will provide twice as much benefit to men than women, a new analysis has found. The analysis by the Australia Institute, released today, found that in 2024-25, the first year of the third stage of the government\u2019s tax plan, men will pocket $11bn in income tax cuts while women receive just $6bn. Income tax cuts are the first order of business when parliament resumes in the first week of July but the Coalition and Labor are locked in a high-stakes game of chicken, with both warning cuts for low- and middle-income earners should not be delayed by political posturing over the final stage. \u201cThe Coolwell sisters are not sure when their grief and loss will end,\u201d write Lorena Allam and Taylor Fuller. \u201cThey have lost two brothers through deaths in custody, and even though both men have been the subject of a coronial inquest \u2013 one released just this week \u2013 the family still doesn\u2019t have the answers they need to heal and move on.\u201d Bradley Coolwell and his younger brother, Shaun, both troubled and in poor health, died after being restrained face down by police and hospital guards. \u201cIt was the same house, the same hospital,\u201d their sister Sonya says. \u201cWe are never going to heal.

Days after the 25th anniversary of the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman, OJ Simpson has reportedly launched a Twitter account. In the account, there is a video post in which the former football star, who was the prime suspect in the murders and ultimately acquitted of the crime after a televised trial, says he has got a \u201clittle gettin\u2019 even to do\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Father\u2019s Day is always a tricky occasion in the Boris Johnson households, so it was perhaps understandable he chose to send along a lectern to represent him at the Channel 4 Tory leadership debate instead. It proved to be an inspired move, because the lectern answered the questions far more directly and honestly than Johnson ever would. If only the lectern had taken his place at the foreign affairs select committee, there\u2019s a good chance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe\">Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe</a> would have been released from her Iranian jail by now.</p> <p>Curiously, everyone but Jeremy Hunt chose to ignore the fact that the odds-on favourite to become the next prime minister was otherwise engaged.

Which, come to think of it, was more or less exactly what had happened. Still, at least it gave the others some more airtime. Not that it did many of them much good.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/13/the-strongarm-tactics-pay-off-for-smirking-team-boris\">The strongarm tactics pay off for smirking Team Boris | John Crace</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s been a good 20 years or so since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/10/tory-hopefuls-prove-you-dont-need-to-be-on-drugs-to-be-off-your-head\">Michael Gove last did cocaine</a>, but he appeared to be still suffering from the after-effects. Angry, edgy, wired and shouty. Asked to take the first question on how he would win an election against Nigel Farage and Jeremy Corbyn he merely insisted he would win because he was the best, and became increasingly bewildered and tetchy when nobody clapped anything he said. \u201cI\u2019ve put everything on the line,\u201d he later added. Under the circumstances, not the best choice of words.</p> <p>Things began to turn nasty when the questions turned to Brexit as Gove, Hunt, Sajid Javid and Dominic Raab tried to outdo one another with how hard they were. A contest in which there was only ever going to be one winner. Raab had clearly been briefed to try to remember to smile but it wasn\u2019t long before the anger vein on his forehead was throbbing as the steroids coursed through his veins. When Rory Stewart called him out for being deranged, it looked as if Raab was seconds away from taking an axe to him. And then taking out the entire audience. The new muscular Conservatism.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m an entrepreneur,\u201d Hunt replied irrelevantly to almost every question. He didn\u2019t look much like a businessman. With his Union Jack lapel badge he seemed more like a British Airways senior cabin steward on a long-haul flight.

      "bodyText": "Father\u2019s Day is always a tricky occasion in the Boris Johnson households, so it was perhaps understandable he chose to send along a lectern to represent him at the Channel 4 Tory leadership debate instead. It proved to be an inspired move, because the lectern answered the questions far more directly and honestly than Johnson ever would. If only the lectern had taken his place at the foreign affairs select committee, there\u2019s a good chance Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe would have been released from her Iranian jail by now. Curiously, everyone but Jeremy Hunt chose to ignore the fact that the odds-on favourite to become the next prime minister was otherwise engaged. And he only appeared to notice about halfway through with a slightly embarrassed, \u2018Where\u2019s Boris?\u2019 It was as if someone had shat themselves and everyone was too polite to mention it. Which, come to think of it, was more or less exactly what had happened. Still, at least it gave the others some more airtime. Not that it did many of them much good. It\u2019s been a good 20 years or so since Michael Gove last did cocaine, but he appeared to be still suffering from the after-effects. Angry, edgy, wired and shouty. Asked to take the first question on how he would win an election against Nigel Farage and Jeremy Corbyn he merely insisted he would win because he was the best, and became increasingly bewildered and tetchy when nobody clapped anything he said. \u201cI\u2019ve put everything on the line,\u201d he later added. Under the circumstances, not the best choice of words. Things began to turn nasty when the questions turned to Brexit as Gove, Hunt, Sajid Javid and Dominic Raab tried to outdo one another with how hard they were. A contest in which there was only ever going to be one winner. Raab had clearly been briefed to try to remember to smile but it wasn\u2019t long before the anger vein on his forehead was throbbing as the steroids coursed through his veins. When Rory Stewart called him out for being deranged, it looked as if Raab was seconds away from taking an axe to him. And then taking out the entire audience. The new muscular Conservatism. \u201cI\u2019m an entrepreneur,\u201d Hunt replied irrelevantly to almost every question. He didn\u2019t look much like a businessman. With his Union Jack lapel badge he seemed more like a British Airways senior cabin steward on a long-haul flight. Javid wisely chose not to mention that he\u2019d made a fortune as a banker selling credit default swaps in the run up to the financial crisis, but still tried to pull macho rank. He was a man who got things done even though he couldn\u2019t point to anything he\u2019d actually got done.

      "body": "<p>Remind me: where had we got to with Top Gear? Ever since Jeremy Clarkson got sacked for punching that producer \u2013 amazingly, more than four years ago \u2013 the BBC has struggled to replace, or revive, or reboot the formula that made the show such a storming success. There was the new model with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/31/top-gear-chris-evans-matt-leblanc-trailer-bbc\" title=\"\">Matt LeBlanc and Chris Evans</a> that didn\u2019t really work. Then they tried a cut-and-shut version \u2013 without Evans, but with LeBlanc \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/31/matt-leblanc-to-leave-top-gear-bbc\" title=\"\">but that didn\u2019t really work either</a>.</p> <p>The latest incarnation on BBC Two retains Evans\u2019s replacement, motoring journalist Chris Harris, and partners him with \u2013 wait for it \u2013 Freddie Flintoff and Paddy McGuinness, the former England cricket captain and the erstwhile host of history\u2019s most execrable game show, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/jan/06/take-me-out-saturday-night-tv-best\" title=\"\">Take Me Out</a>. It seems that the producers of Top Gear had developed a casting strategy based on that parlour game where you pull the names of celebrities out of a hat, and everyone keeps saying: \u201cSorry, I have no idea who this person is.\u201d</p> <p>But you know what? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/12/a-caring-sharing-top-gear-it-actually-just-might-work\" title=\"\">Against all the odds, it works</a>. It gives me no particular pleasure to suggest that some of the original magic of Top Gear has been rekindled by this unlikely trio, but, miraculously, it has. The larky, bad-tempered chemistry that existed between Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond has been replicated in a slightly sunnier form, and with a fresh energy. The old format has life in it yet.</p> <p>The first thing you notice is how young they all look. I mean relatively \u2013 they are all in their 40s \u2013 but compared with the grumpy, fed-up trio that took their act to Amazon and launched <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/18/the-grand-tour-review-jeremy-clarkson-amazon-prime\" title=\"\">The Grand Tour</a>, Harris, Flintoff and McGuinness look like a bold experiment in youth outreach. And to have not one but two northern presenters seems, in the context of Top Gear, like a stab at diversity. \u201cI genuinely cannot understand a single word you two are saying,\u201d says Harris at the outset.</p> <p>For this series \u2013 the 27th \u2013 most of the gimmicky short segments have been dispensed with. The Stig is mentioned in passing, but does not appear. There are no celebrity guests. The main event is a junket to Ethiopia, with each presenter driving an approximation of the first car they ever owned: a Ford Escort, a Mini and, for Flintoff, a Porsche Boxster (he was a professional cricketer, after all).</p> <p>The vehicles disintegrate in the manner we have all come to expect. Tempers fray a little in the heat, and the trio take part in some deeply stupid challenges (one of them involves driving while blindfolded), with a chunky knit jumper being awarded to the loser. McGuinness and Flintoff seize every opportunity to remind Harris that he is short. It is as undemanding as ever, although, for a brief moment when Harris demonstrates how to change a tyre without using a jack, I think I might be on the verge of learning something.</p> <p>This new incarnation is, if not exactly politically correct, at least not as aggressively un-PC as it was in the Clarkson days, when every segment seemed to be staged in defiance of the imagined objections of a muesli-eating, Guardian-reading, bicycle-riding straw man. The beauty of Ethiopia is frequently extolled, whereas before it might have served as a backdrop for a borderline racist prank. As if to assert how far the series has moved on, next week\u2019s episode is devoted to electric cars. Try to imagine that happening under the Clarkson-Hammond-May axis. They would have probably just set fire to them, to the cheers of the studio audience.</p> <p>In that old line-up, the banter between the presenters could often feel more like workplace bullying. There was a period when it seemed that Clarkson and May were actively trying to murder Hammond \u2013 and there was a brief window when they might have got away with it. In contrast, the insults traded by McGuinness, Flintoff and Harris are barbed, but good-natured. The chemistry between them may be a fabrication, but it is chemistry nonetheless. What they share with Clarkson and his mates is a reliable comic timing. McGuinness may be the only one with \u201ccomedian\u201d on his CV, but it is Harris who holds it all together. He has a wonderful deadpan stare, which makes him look angry and hurt at the same time.</p> <p>Top Gear\u2019s great success lay in its appeal to viewers who didn\u2019t care about cars. It was crowdpleasing fare; it went nowhere, fast. On this showing, it\u2019s not going anywhere soon.</p>",

It seems that the producers of Top Gear had developed a casting strategy based on that parlour game where you pull the names of celebrities out of a hat, and everyone keeps saying: \u201cSorry, I have no idea who this person is.\u201d But you know what? Against all the odds, it works. It gives me no particular pleasure to suggest that some of the original magic of Top Gear has been rekindled by this unlikely trio, but, miraculously, it has. The larky, bad-tempered chemistry that existed between Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond has been replicated in a slightly sunnier form, and with a fresh energy. The old format has life in it yet. The first thing you notice is how young they all look. I mean relatively \u2013 they are all in their 40s \u2013 but compared with the grumpy, fed-up trio that took their act to Amazon and launched The Grand Tour, Harris, Flintoff and McGuinness look like a bold experiment in youth outreach. And to have not one but two northern presenters seems, in the context of Top Gear, like a stab at diversity. \u201cI genuinely cannot understand a single word you two are saying,\u201d says Harris at the outset. For this series \u2013 the 27th \u2013 most of the gimmicky short segments have been dispensed with. The Stig is mentioned in passing, but does not appear. There are no celebrity guests. The main event is a junket to Ethiopia, with each presenter driving an approximation of the first car they ever owned: a Ford Escort, a Mini and, for Flintoff, a Porsche Boxster (he was a professional cricketer, after all). The vehicles disintegrate in the manner we have all come to expect. Tempers fray a little in the heat, and the trio take part in some deeply stupid challenges (one of them involves driving while blindfolded), with a chunky knit jumper being awarded to the loser. McGuinness and Flintoff seize every opportunity to remind Harris that he is short. It is as undemanding as ever, although, for a brief moment when Harris demonstrates how to change a tyre without using a jack, I think I might be on the verge of learning something. This new incarnation is, if not exactly politically correct, at least not as aggressively un-PC as it was in the Clarkson days, when every segment seemed to be staged in defiance of the imagined objections of a muesli-eating, Guardian-reading, bicycle-riding straw man. The beauty of Ethiopia is frequently extolled, whereas before it might have served as a backdrop for a borderline racist prank. As if to assert how far the series has moved on, next week\u2019s episode is devoted to electric cars. Try to imagine that happening under the Clarkson-Hammond-May axis. They would have probably just set fire to them, to the cheers of the studio audience. In that old line-up, the banter between the presenters could often feel more like workplace bullying. There was a period when it seemed that Clarkson and May were actively trying to murder Hammond \u2013 and there was a brief window when they might have got away with it. In contrast, the insults traded by McGuinness, Flintoff and Harris are barbed, but good-natured. The chemistry between them may be a fabrication, but it is chemistry nonetheless. What they share with Clarkson and his mates is a reliable comic timing. McGuinness may be the only one with \u201ccomedian\u201d on his CV, but it is Harris who holds it all together. He has a wonderful deadpan stare, which makes him look angry and hurt at the same time. Top Gear\u2019s great success lay in its appeal to viewers who didn\u2019t care about cars. It was crowdpleasing fare; it went nowhere, fast. On this showing, it\u2019s not going anywhere soon.",

We wanted to bowl first. There was enough there if you bowled in the right areas. The template has been really good so far, a team batting effort with Rohit\u2019s outstanding knock. To get to 335 you need a team effort. KL laid a good founation with Rohit who showed why he is such a good player, which allowed me to play a certain role and for Hardik to explode. I\u2019m happy playing that role. The template is going really nicely. Kuldeep was brilliant. They were trying to play him off and thinking he would go out of the attack but a longer spell helped and he was getting more rhythm with every other and the ball to get Babar was outstanding with drift and turn. It was a very important moment in the game. It\u2019s the best he bowled since coming to England. I think they outplayed us in the Champions Trophy final but apart from that we\u2019ve played some really good cricket against Pakistan. We never approach these games from the fan point of view, as cricketers we need to know what to do and be professional about. Bhuvi has a slight niggle from slipping on the footmarks, hopefully he\u2019ll be ready in a couple of games or maximum three games from now. We have Shami ready and raring to go so we\u2019re not too worried ahout where it stands. Bhuvi should be fine. He doesn\u2019t feel it is too bad. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d068d298f08532f138d2d23\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-16T18:42:47.975Z\">7.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Sarfraz Ahmed, Pakistan\u2019s captain, speaks. </strong>We didn\u2019t bowl in the right areas and he (Rohit) played really well. Our play is to bowl in the right area but we didn\u2019t hit them. It was a good toss but we didn\u2019t capitalise, which is why we conceded so many runs. We picked two spinners because of the moisture and they bowled well but in the middle part India batted really well. We were going good until we lost those wickets so quickly. When Imam got out we needed a partnership and got it but we lost too many quick wickets.

When you are set you want to get as many runs as possible but I wasn\u2019t thinking about a double hundred. We wanted to kill the game there but I got out unfortunately.

But the idea was just to play out the new ball then see where the game went from there.

A school-going kid in India will say Pakistan on being asked the opposite of India. That is how deep rooted the animosity is. The religious divide poisons it further as religion poisons everything it touches. It is bigger than El Clasico, North London Derby, Manchester Derby, Ashes, UCL final and London Marathon put together. There is no logic or rationale. To put it in context, my 80+ grandmom (who can\u2019t tell a kookaburra from a baseball or a golf ball) says \u201dIt does not matter if India loses all the matches but it must BEAT Pakistan (accompanied with a headmaster administering a spanking mime).

It\u2019s the noisiest, niggliest, most intense, most watched game there can be, unless India and Pakistan meet again in the final, as they did two years ago, also on English turf.<strong> </strong>The last match I covered, England v West Indies 48 hours ago, was under-hyped. That\u2019s not a problem today.</p> <p>This is England, so we have to start by talking about the weather. According to the Met Office, there\u2019s rain around but it\u2019s not expected to be serious until lunchtime. We should get a game, albeit a truncated one.</p> <p>Both teams want to win in the same way Arsenal want to beat Spurs, or a six-year-old wants a bigger slice of cake than her eight-year-old sister. But only one of the teams needs to win. India have started authoritatively, beating Australia, dropping a point only to the rain. Pakistan have started characteristically, listless one day (against West Indies), lethal the next (against England). Currently ninth out of ten, caught between Bangladesh and Afghanistan, they really need a victory today. In fact, they need it so badly they\u2019ve gone to the trouble of electing a World Cup-winning captain as their prime minister. </p> <p>The form guide is interesting. In all their one-day international meetings, Pakistan are well ahead, by 73 wins to 54. But in the World Cup, where they have met six times, it\u2019s 6-0 to India. And the Indians may still be smarting from the 2017 Champions Trophy, when they won the group match easily, only to be humbled in the final. Whichever way you look at it, it\u2019s a game to savour. It begins, clouds permitting, at 10.30am BST, in about an hour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5aea4a2a5e4884b3b586b5e4594bda76b7783c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5aea4a2a5e4884b3b586b5e4594bda76b7783c3/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"India fans prior to the match at Old Trafford.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">India fans prior to the match at Old Trafford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7d2fb91704de85f1d54c4468f04f7cf83d9e669\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7d2fb91704de85f1d54c4468f04f7cf83d9e669/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\".A hopeful Pakistan fan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">.A hopeful Pakistan fan</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e554108b9b21f596173065859d1777e18dd6b1f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e554108b9b21f596173065859d1777e18dd6b1f2/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man pokes out of a sun roof to show his support for India.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man pokes out of a sun roof to show his support for India.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-16T12:16:38.901Z\">at 1.16pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Tanya Aldred discusses Virat Kohli ... Here is the report form Old Trafford ... That\u2019s me done. Thanks for your company throughout the course of this massive day at Old Trafford. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow at Taunton on the OBO. Have a lovely night. Bye! Virat Kohli, India\u2019s captain, speaks. To be honest, the pitch didn\u2019t make a lot of difference but the ball started turning in the second half of our batting innings. We wanted to bowl first. There was enough there if you bowled in the right areas. The template has been really good so far, a team batting effort with Rohit\u2019s outstanding knock. To get to 335 you need a team effort. KL laid a good founation with Rohit who showed why he is such a good player, which allowed me to play a certain role and for Hardik to explode. I\u2019m happy playing that role. The template is going really nicely. Kuldeep was brilliant. They were trying to play him off and thinking he would go out of the attack but a longer spell helped and he was getting more rhythm with every other and the ball to get Babar was outstanding with drift and turn. It was a very important moment in the game. It\u2019s the best he bowled since coming to England. I think they outplayed us in the Champions Trophy final but apart from that we\u2019ve played some really good cricket against Pakistan. We never approach these games from the fan point of view, as cricketers we need to know what to do and be professional about. Bhuvi has a slight niggle from slipping on the footmarks, hopefully he\u2019ll be ready in a couple of games or maximum three games from now. We have Shami ready and raring to go so we\u2019re not too worried ahout where it stands. Bhuvi should be fine. He doesn\u2019t feel it is too bad. Sarfraz Ahmed, Pakistan\u2019s captain, speaks. We didn\u2019t bowl in the right areas and he (Rohit) played really well. Our play is to bowl in the right area but we didn\u2019t hit them. It was a good toss but we didn\u2019t capitalise, which is why we conceded so many runs. We picked two spinners because of the moisture and they bowled well but in the middle part India batted really well. We were going good until we lost those wickets so quickly. When Imam got out we needed a partnership and got it but we lost too many quick wickets. We will bounce back. I didn\u2019t think of this at the time... but Gary Naylor makes a decent point. Rohit Sharma is the man of the match for his 140. He says: I\u2019m happy with the way we played as a team. We wanted to get on the park and play having the previous game washed out. We had intent and showed it today. I was unhappy when I got out, I should have read it. A little misjudgment. When you are set you want to get as many runs as possible but I wasn\u2019t thinking about a double hundred. We wanted to kill the game there but I got out unfortunately. I think Rahul played very well. He took some time, which was required at that point. He saw the new ball off then he was looking good but again got out at the wrong time. But the idea was just to play out the new ball then see where the game went from there. We got a good start and built well from there. A clinical win for India. Their big guns fired with the bat and their bowling attack did the job when it mattered. India remain undefeated in the tournament with Pakistan left languishing in second last position as they enter last chance cafe. We\u2019ll hear from the man of the match and the captains shortly. 40th over: Pakistan 212-6 (Imad 46, Shadab 20) DLS target 302 in 40 overs Hardik, who picked up two in two balls earlier when the game was still on, gets the final over. Four singles, and that\u2019s the game! India have once again beaten Pakistan in the World Cup. That makes seven out of seven in this tournament. It\u2019s a thrashing. 39th over: Pakistan 208-6 (Imad 44, Shadab 18) DLS target 302 in 40 overs Imad takes a piece of Bumrah, pumping him down the ground for his fifth boundary. He\u2019s batted quite nicely, even if it was after the game was well and truly over as a contest. Gosh, this is not an attractive end - Bumrah has overstepped, Imad getting another four to third man, lifted nicely over the cordon. Free hit, pushed to cover. 12 from this one. One to go. 38th over: Pakistan 196-6 (Imad 38, Shadab 17) DLS target 302 in 40 overs Long hop from Chahal to Imad, put away to cover, prompting a word from captain Kohli. There is a wide shot of the temporary stand on the telly, which had 7800 people in it earlier. There might be 780 people left. Shadab should be taken but Rahul drops him at midwicket. A very simple chance, he\u2019s let Chahal down there. Shadab ends the over with a couple more lofted over cover then a hard-run two to mid-on. 14 from it. 53 an over is the required rate from here. (Sorry) 37th over: Pakistan 182-6 (Imad 27, Shadab 11) DLS target 302 in 40 overs Bumrah is bowling. Remember when Bhuvi hurt his hamstring slipping around earlier following a rain delay earlier when they ran straight back on? Shadab grabs a couple down the ground then another in that direction. Bumrah is just jogging in, really. Imad slices him over gully for a couple more, then going the other side of point for one. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m describing these shots. Oh, there\u2019s one to note: Shadab smashes a four down the ground. It\u2019s a lovely off-drive shot from a young man with a massive future. 36th over: Pakistan 172-6 (Imad 24, Shadab 4) DLS target 302 in 40 overs Well, they aren\u2019t going for the 30-odd runs an over they require. Chahal deserves to get into the book for some of the overs he bowled earlier. He\u2019s sending down his usual mix of leggies and wrong\u2019uns. A couple of slaps end the over. Six from it. The players are back on the field! Pakistan need 302 to win. That\u2019s 139 in five overs. Yes, you\u2019re reading all of that correctly. PLAY! \u201cAfter all these years, the game retains the old-school quintessentially British mentality about it,\u201d says Aditya Anchuri \u201cA pointless 5 overs without any rhyme or reason.\u201d It\u2019s difficult to understand why the umps didn\u2019t call it. I have a conspiracy theory but I should keep it to myself given I want to keep getting into this World Cup. It has been a dirty day for Pakistan. The nonsense we\u2019re about to see might actually help their NRR as they are (surely) unlikely to be bowled out. Well... Five overs remaining! Pakistan need 136 in five overs to win. What a sport. The most likely scenario... is surely still that Umpires Oxenford and Erasmus will pull the pin shortly. The rain was light but the clean up takes time. A frustrating way to end a very ordinary game of cricket. But we\u2019ll be here till the end! Well put. Believe it or not! A lot of dead rubbers could be coming our way. It\u2019s still drizzling. They can\u2019t remove the covers. It\u2019s unclear when the cut off time is, but we must be pretty close. \u201cAm I the only Indian fan here feeling a lack of emotion for this efficient Indian team winning games by ruthlessly executing a game plan?\u201d asks Fahd Mashood. \u201cI miss the magic and despair of the days when Sehwag walked out and did whatever he felt like with a big goofy grin on his face regardless of what the coach and captain begged him to do in the dressing room five minutes prior. Instead of tonking six sizes like Yuvaraj, this team would probably knock down the last two balls having met their mini target from the first four balls. I might even take the dark days of the nineties when we had a middling team held together by the genius of Sachin and Kumble. Because that more accurately represents our country. A few shining lights in a sea of mediocrity, and mostly a lot of things completely inexplicable to anyone who isn\u2019t an Indian. Not this bunch of cold hearted winners.\u201d Tough to please! Lap it up, I say. This is a superb cricket team. No news is bad news, I am afraid. It\u2019s raining (lightly) and dark. I suspect this is all heading in one direction. I\u2019ll keep you posted as formal updates land on my desk. On come the big covers as well. This doesn\u2019t look good in terms of any meaningful re-start. Wasim Akram on the telly, who played here for a decade at Lancs, isn\u2019t hopeful either. The Cricket Ground DJ (my job one day) plays Purple Rain. \u201cThis Indian team is really very good, isn\u2019t it?\u201d says Colum Farrelly. \u201cThe best team in the competition so far? Australia are dark horses. England might suffer from having been talked up a bit too much in the press.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t worry about England listening to the press, etc. They are a very well put together team - superbly led too. But to your first point: yes, India are quite brilliant. The way they batted earlier today made it look so easy and it\u2019s just not. 35th over: Pakistan 166-6 (Imad 22, Shadhad 1) Shadhab is off the mark with a single but nothing further. Shankar has 2/22 from his five; quite a handy World Cup debut. We\u2019ll see more of him over the course of the next month, I\u2019m sure. At the end of the over, the umpires come together and they again call for the covers. The rain isn\u2019t that heavy but it is consistent now, the umbrellas telling the story. Pakistan are 86 runs behind the DLS score if the match is called off at this stage. \u201cFunny that Bumrah has been India\u2019s least effective bowler today!\u201d notes Anand Kumar. \u201cAs an Indian fan, pleased that the bowling attack has done well despite Bumrah not firing and Bhuvi going off. Haven\u2019t been able to say this many times in our cricketing history.\u201d That\u2019s quite right. Bumrah wasn\u2019t at his penetrative best earlier on, aside from one over. As for Bhuvi, he did the right thing going off when he did. India now have a week off (or so), coming at a useful time in the context of that injury. \u201cBeen able to hear OT crowd most of the day here in Moss Side but it\u2019s quietening down now unfortunately,\u201d reports Darren Carter. You\u2019ll hear the Indian crowd again soon when they finish this off, that\u2019s for sure. Trying to create something, the Pakistan captain shuffles across his stumps in an effort to open up the legside against Shankar but only succeeds in cramping himself up, chopping onto the middle stump. 34th over: Pakistan 165-5 (Sarfraz 12, Imad 22) I see rain, I see umbrellas. Not many up yet but we know what is coming. For the second time in two overs from Bumrah, Imad crunches him for four. Last time it was a pull, now a slap straight past the non-strikers\u2019 stumps. Fair play to Imad. He bowled nicely earlier today as the game was getting away from Pakistan and he\u2019s having a a dip here. The umpires consult at the end of the over and agree to let the game go on. For now. 33rd over: Pakistan 157-5 (Sarfraz 11, Imad 16) Shankar is back as well, Kohli still mindful of getting overs out of his change bowlers even if the required rate is increasingly beyond Pakistan. Three nondescript singles follow alongside one piece of brilliant Jadeja fielding. On for Bhuvi as a sub, he makes a lot of ground to his right before diving to cut off a powerful Sarfraz cut shot at backward point. \u201cGoing back to that Kohli wicket for a moment,\u201d asks Deepak Nandhakumar. Sure, why not? \u201cAccording to the commentators, and I don\u2019t know how they knew this, there was some sort of crack or gap between Virat\u2019s bat handle and the bat itself. This seems to have produced a sound when he swung the bat that led him to think he\u2019d nicked it. Cricket, eh? P.s.: The cameras caught Kohli\u2019s reaction in the dressing room when Dhoni swung the broken bat around and seemed to reproduce the sound. \u201cEnraged\u201d and \u201cheartbroken\u201d don\u2019t even begin to cover it.\u201d I think he\u2019ll be okay. Interesting that he walked, though. I suspet that will be, as we say in the caper, a ~talking point~ after the game. 32nd over: Pakistan 154-5 (Sarfraz 10, Imad 15) Bumrah is back instead of letting Kuldeep finish his ten. It feels like a long, long time since we last saw him in the attack. The sting has completely gone out of this game, Pakistan\u2019s 150 barely responded to by their faithful fans, no doubt gutted at what has happened here today. Imad does finish with a top shot, pulling the Indian attack-leader off his nose for a boundary. Drinks it is with the DLS par score sitting at 227. Miles off. 31st over: Pakistan 146-5 (Sarfraz 9, Imad 8) It\u2019s very dark here now, the lights doing almost all of the heavy lifting in terms of keeping the ground visible. The rain probably isn\u2019t far away. The cricket is just as grim, Pakistan walking singles to the sweepers off Hardik; India happy to let them to so. They now need in excess of ten an over. On reflection, should Hasan/Wahab not walked out to at least have a pop at the target before reverting to whatever this now is? 30th over: Pakistan 140-5 (Sarfraz 5, Imad 6) Stepping back from it now the result is all-but certain, Pakistan have only really \u201cwon\u201d a few five-over blocks all day. India deserve to win this by a mile. Kuldeep has 2/32 from nine. Deserves another. 29th over: Pakistan 137-5 (Sarfraz 3, Imad 5) Imad pulls Hardik away for four. I don\u2019t want to pre-empt it, but I think Sarfraz might be dropping the anchor in an effort to bat out the 50 overs for what little they would achieve in terms of Net Run Rate for making it that far. I\u2019m increasingly convinced that we\u2019ve outgrown NRR. Alternatively... \u201cPakistan appears not to let rain settle the tie,\u201d laments Krishnamoorthy. \u201cWho needs rains when Pakistan is on its self destructive day?\u201d 28th over: Pakistan 132-5 (Sarfraz 2, Imad 1) Both batsmen yet to score as Kuldeep continues, Kohli going for the kill with his top trump. And what a fantastic bowling change it was from the Indian captain to get Hardik back on from the Statham End, his opposing number watching both wickets from the non-strikers\u2019 end. What do they do now? The DLS target is now 217. Before the four wickets in 20 balls it was going so well, Babar and Fakhar building so positively. Dear me. Two in two balls! Hardik bowls Shoaib Malik for a golden duck and will be on a hat-trick to begin his next over. It\u2019s a quick delivery and the veteran plays all around it, chopping on. Pakistan have lost 4/12. Old Trafford is HEAVING. 27th over: Pakistan 129-5 (Sarfraz 0) Pakistan are capitulating! Hafeez strikes his clip well, and the shot is there, but he\u2019s popped the catch down the throat of Shankar on the square leg rope. Kohli gives it BIG, knowing that they are not far away from finishing this in a hurry. 26th over: Pakistan 126-3 (Hafeez 7, Sarfraz 0) A wicket maiden is completed by Kuldeep! He\u2019s been outstanding from the get-go in this innings, now boasting the figures of 2/26 from his seven. Sarfraz, once again, has to lead a rally. Pakistan are also now about 40 runs behind the DLS target with the loss of those two wickets. \u201cBall Of The Tournament,\u201d declares Abhijato Sensarma of the ball that picked up Babar. Hard to disagree. Certainly as far as the slow bowlers are concerned. He\u2019s got the both of them! Not a great shot from Fakhar, who top edges Kuldeep to Chanal on the 45. The left-hander was sweeping compulsively over the last few overs and it looked a winning strategy, but not on this occasion. It\u2019s gloomy for Pakistan now, both in terms of the chase and the DLS target with rain again likely. 25th over: Pakistan 126-2 (Fakhar 62, Hafeez 7) \u201cHe did Babar on two fronts there,\u201d Michael Clarke says. \u201cFlight and drift and then the spin off the surface. This is what makes the young man so talented.\u201d After exchanging four singles to the sweepers from Chahal\u2019s new over, Hafeez finishes with a massive slog sweep over the fence at deep midwicket FOR SIX MORE! Have that, says the new (old) man! GORGEOUS delivery! Through the gate from over the wicket, Kuldeep has bowled Babar! Nothing outlandish about the shot, the No3 forward and defending - this wicket is all about a piece of magnificent wrist spin. He celebrates accordingly! 24th over: Pakistan 117-2 (Fakhar 60) 23rd over: Pakistan 113-1 (Fakhar 58, Babar 46) Forget what I said about Babar not taking a risk, he\u2019s getting down low here to slog sweep Chahal BIG for SIX! 88 metres into the western stand beneath the old pavilion. What a strike! Ten are taken from the over after four singles are added, Fakhar now very happy sweeping at every available opportunity. The 100 partnership is up too, making it the highest stand for Pakistan in a World Cup game against India, would you believe. \u201cGood evening Adam.\u201d Hi Venkat from Bangalore. \u201cA basic query: for a potential stumping, why does the third umpire check for a no ball? Can\u2019t a batsman be stumped off a no-ball?\u201d Nup. You can be stumped off a wide but not a no-ball. 22nd over: Pakistan 103-1 (Fakhar 56, Babar 38) Fakhar is turning up the volume now. For the second time in as many overs he has employed the slog sweep, this time hitting it low and flat, bouncing into the boundary in front of the enormous temporary stand to the east of Old Trafford. With the shot, Pakistan bring up their 100. They need over eight an over from here but these two have put on 90. 21st over: Pakistan 95-1 (Fakhar 51, Babar 35) BIG! We have our first SIX of the innings, Fakhar tucking into the first ball of Chahal\u2019s fresh over, just clearing the two men out on the rope with a slog sweep. It was high in the air for a long time but he had enough on it to clear the rope by a couple of metres, completing his half-century in 59 balls. \u201cHe saves his best for India,\u201d says Michael Clarke on telly. They go back to the leg before pad-bat/bat-pad from Chahal\u2019s previous over on TV and it did hit the pad first. Kohli liked it at the time and was seemingly talked out of reviewing by Dhoni. Back to the middle Chahal is happy to give plenty of air, enough to bring caution from Babar, who won\u2019t be taking any risks. Yet. 20th over: Pakistan 87-1 (Fakhar 44, Babar 34) After the close call, Fakhar gets off strike down the ground, Babar playing out the rest of the Kuldeep over carefully. NOT OUT! Dhoni whipped the bails off quickly but the left-hander got his toe back in time. IS FAKHAR STUMPED BY DHONI? We\u2019ll find out. 19th over: Pakistan 86-1 (Fakhar 43, Babar 34) Babar picks out point from the first ball, Fakhar absorbing a couple of dots before giving the strike back. Chahal\u2019s wrong\u2019un nearly gets Babar later in the set, zipping off the surface. It was not far away at all for a pad/bat situation, which would have ended his stay I\u2019m fairly sure. Clarke believes it was pad first, on TV comms. An excellent over, two off it. \u201cFirst thing that springs to mind is Melle Mel\u2019s rap intro to Chaka Khan\u2019s I Feel For you,\u201d Gregor Salsa says in relation to Shikhar Dhawan earworms. 18th over: Pakistan 84-1 (Fakhar 42, Babar 33) Kuldeep gets spun around to bowl from the Jimmy Anderson end as well, following the example of the seamers used so far today. One, two, three, four, five singles on the trot with all the sweepers forward of square all getting a chance to touch the ball along the way. \u201cHey Adam.\u201d Hi Paul Macadam. \u201c Before today, the toss-winning captain at this tournament has chosen to bowl first on 14 occasions (excluding washouts). Only six times has it led to victory. Have some skippers been guilty of looking too much at the gloomy clouds and not enough at the less threatening pitches? Or is it more a case of teams using the new ball poorly?\u201d Perhaps the T20 influence, as well. Anything you can make we can make more? 17th over: Pakistan 79-1 (Fakhar 40, Babar 30) Yuzvendra Chahal for the first time today from the Brian Statham End. Fakhar is immediately lapping, albeit from the toe of the bat. Now Babar, who takes him on first up too, with the cut, but Karthik - on as a sub - makes a wonderful one-handed stop at backward point. This is a really important period of the game. Can they get on top of India\u2019s spin twins? 16th over: Pakistan 75-1 (Fakhar 38, Babar 28) Good batting from Babar to begin, taking on mid-on after getting on the front foot to drive Hardik. Fakhar\u2019s turn, leaning back to WALLOP the seamer\u2019s length delivery over midwicket from the front foot, bouncing a couple of times before crashing into the boundary in front of the old pavilion. He makes it two fours in the over with a less convincing stroke from the outside to third man. Actually, watching it back he might have meant it with so much room to swing at a slower ball. Either way, it makes ten from it. 15th over: Pakistan 64-1 (Fakhar 28, Babar 27) Kuldeep\u2019s second over is being played as watchfully as his first, until the final delivery when Fakhar leans back to slap but miscues off the edge. Still, he gets three for it. India aren\u2019t far away from another. Drinks! 14th over: Pakistan 58-1 (Fakhar 24, Babar 25) Hamstring tightness is the word from the Indian camp when it comes to Bhuvi. Do they run the gauntlet and get him back on? It would be a high-risk strategy, but we know this game means more to those on the field than the two points on offer in this tournament. Hardik is unlucky to concede a boundary from a good ball that gets big on Fakhar, edging to the third man rope. He also prompts a false stroke from Babar, his outside edge in action too with the ball going to third man rather than to hand. Very good set. 13th over: Pakistan 51-1 (Fakhar 19, Babar 23) Turn it is, Hardik replaced by the left-armer Kuldeep. A fraction slower than his legspinning colleague, will Pakistan target him, I wonder? If they can put a dent in one of the spinners - with Bhuvi already in strife - they can change the nature of this chase. Especially with rain still floating around on the radar and DLS likely to play its part. Well, not initially they don\u2019t. It\u2019s an accurate first set from Kuldeep, releasing mostly from the back of his hand. It takes Fakhar five deliveries to get off strike, with one to deep cover, bringing up the 50. Babar keeps the strike with another single, lapping fine. 12th over: Pakistan 49-1 (Fakhar 18, Babar 22) Shankar is charging in and bending his back, both batsmen happy enough stroking out towards deep point. Babar nearly beats the sweeper off the front foot for a couple and doubles it from the final ball, leaning back in his crease to steer behind point. That\u2019s a beautifully timed boundary. After losing an early wicket Pakistan have got their mojo back. \u201cYour Shikhar Dhawan earworm can be found at the 2:10 mark in \u201cBrick House\u201d by The Commodores,\u201d suggests Marie Meyer in Santa Fe. Let\u2019s give it a go. 11th over: Pakistan 41-1 (Fakhar 17, Babar 15) How long until we see spin, I wonder? With the sun now out, grip shouldn\u2019t now be too much of a bother for Kuldeep and Chahal. Hardik bowls the first over after the fielding restrictions are lifted, Babar and Fakhar trading in singles for now. No inch given. 10th over: Pakistan 38-1 (Fakhar 16, Babar 13) Shankar has been swung around to follow Bumrah from the southern end. Both he and Hardik have a lot of work to do with Bhuvi seemingly out of the equation (for now at least), Bumrah the sole specialist seamer in this new equation for Kohli. He starts well here to Babar, finding his outside edge, the ball spitting out to third man. Fakhar is also short of convincing, his inside edge clipped. Shankar will be disappointed not to finish the over quite so well, a wide sprayed down the legside, Babar striking the extra ball from the middle of the bat wide of mid-off to keep the strike. Nice contest. 9th over: Pakistan 34-1 (Fakhar 15, Babar 11) TV picks up a message being sent from the rooms to Kohli between overs, presumably relating to the state of Bhuvi\u2019s hamstring. Hardik is brought on to replace Shankar and after watching a couple, Babar leans into a full-blooded cover drive the bisects the men on the circle, racing away for four of the best. 8th over: Pakistan 29-1 (Fakhar 15, Babar 6) Fakhar was the difference between these teams in the 2017 Champions Trophy final and holds the key to any serious chase today, alongside the man he is with at the moment. Bumrah is being played conservatively by the opener, as you would expect, until the final delivery on his hip that he gets inside and pulls around the corner for four! Easy peasy. \u201cI\u2019m guessing someone will have previously earwormed \u2018Ba ba ba Babar Azam\u2019 to the improbably jaunty Beach Boys tune?\u201d asks Brian Withington. \u201cIf not, may I be the first to claim the prize goldfish?\u201d All yours. I have a song in my head for Shikhar Dhawan but I have no idea what it is called. A mid-00s indie dancefloor filler. I\u2019ll Shazam next time I hear it. 7th over: Pakistan 25-1 (Fakhar 11, Babar 6) Shankar stays on. Bhuvi clearly slipped when he was bowling the delivery where he hurt his hamstring. An occupational hazard for a quick when there is rain on the run up. Not fun at all. The all-rounder isn\u2019t as good with his first ball this time around, on the hip of Fakhar and put away accordingly by the opener behind square leg. Giving the strike to Babar, the new man at the crease is trying to get on the front foot to score but plays respectfully. 6th over: Pakistan 20-1 (Fakhar 6, Babar 6) Contests don\u2019t come much more Box Office than Bumrah vs Babar. Early in the over, the Pakistan No3 is off the strike using the pace to third man. He\u2019s back down the business end later in the set, cutting with authority in front of point for four. More between these two, please. \u201cOi Collins.\u201d Here is Robert Wilson, off the long run in Paris. \u201cI\u2019m nauseated by all the OBO back-slapping about you low-rent rejects from sit-com Writers\u2019 Rooms. Particularly when you\u2019re going all eugenic superjock about the laughable paltriness of the French/Harrow/Inadvertent cut. You athletic types have no conception of the moral grandeur that sporting duffitude requires. The mechanics of the thick edge are nothing. It\u2019s the presence of mind and moral authority to make it look like you meant it that wins all hearts. I once did the Robin Smith kneebends after a perfectly square thick eded four..That little touch of eff you and it went exactly where I meant it to go (all while avoiding giggles from the slips) is not available to the merely muscular.\u201d Sometimes, you have to take these as a comment. Crouch well, Bob. Crouch well. 5th over: Pakistan 14-1 (Fakhar 5, Babar 1) Babar has one ball to deal with and it\u2019s jagging back in, finding the inside edge. What a start to his World Cup career with the ball! He\u2019s into the side today replacing Shikhar Dhawan, the opening batsman, let\u2019s not forget. That was his third ODI wicket in this his tenth start. We\u2019ll keep a close eye on the Bhuvi situation. By the way, the technology shows that the Imam lbw was hitting leg stump, so it was a good call not to review. Shankar traps Imam with his first ball! He is on replacing Bhuvi, who leaves the field after the fourth ball of the over. Bhuvi twice beat Imam with a pair of beauties earlier in the over but was reaching for his hamstring. The concern was enough to send him off. Shankar was given the ball to bowl the two balls remaining in the over and nabbed Imam immediately, who needn\u2019t review as that\u2019s smashing middle. Cricket! Good luck explaining that to the uninitiated. 4th over: Pakistan 13-0 (Imam 7, Fakhar 5) Bumrah has two slips in place, Imam playing him respectfully early on before breaking up the off side field with a quick single. Good running. Ooooh! Bumrah bowls a ridiculous delivery in response, pitching middle and leg before somehow missing both the off-stump and Fakhar\u2019s outside edge. Luck is with the opening batsman there. Unplayable, it is. 3rd over: Pakistan 12-0 (Imam 6, Fakhar 5) Shot! Bhuvi has settled really well with plenty of high-quality dots until sliding onto Imam\u2019s pads, the classy southpaw flicking four through midwicket with immaculate timing. Such a fine young player. He grabs another to fine leg to finish, keeping the strike. 2nd over: Pakistan 6-0 (Imam 1, Fakhar 5) You don\u2019t see that often, a full toss outside off stump from Bumrah, cashed in on by Fakhar through cover for four. Sure enough, the world\u2019s No1 ranked ODI bowler bounces straight back with a delivery that cuts away from the left-hander off the deck, beating his horizontal blade. Fakhar is back defending with the straight bat to finish. 1st over: Pakistan 2-0 (Imam 1, Fakhar 1) This is what we expect form Bhuvi. After Imam gets on the board first ball with a flick and Fakhar does likewise, he beats the former with a lovely off-cutter. The sun is out and the crowd are thrilled. \u201cDid Lord Meghnad Desai just write in?\u201d asks Nuggehalli Nigam. \u201cIs that the first time that a Lord has written to the OBO? Mind you, there might a couple of million Meghnad Desais our there but it will be quite charming if this is him.\u201d Lord Desai (or not?), the floor is yours. Try again? Everyone is in position. Bhuvi has the ball, ready to bounce away from us at the northern end. Imam is facing up to the first ball. PLAY!!!!! Odd scenes. With the sun following the rain, India stay out on the field and the umpires do too, despite the fact that the hovercraft cover is on. They want to get this on straight away. Pakistan\u2019s openers - Fakhar and Imam - are also standing by the sight screen, ready to run on as soon as the covers come off. As they do now. \u201cObvious solution,\u201d writes Pete Salmon in relation to the French Cut discussion. \u201cIf the Sqaure Cut is a description of the angle of the trajectory of the ball in relation to the pitch, then surely it should be the Obtuse Cut.\u201d Very good. But I like the Bozza Cut better. To get this to stick, we\u2019re going to have to back it in heavily from now until the end of his Prime Ministership. The Pakistani openers were taking guard and Indian fielders about to take their positions. Guess what happened next? Yep. Here comes that hovercraft. \u201cDoesn\u2019t it sound eerily familiar to Australia\u2019s innings v Sri Lanka yesterday?\u201d asks Tuvic Tuslow in relation to Pakistan\u2019s mini-fightback at the end. It does, actually. Sri Lanka\u2019s death bowling was the best I\u2019ve seen in the tournament. A shame they have no logical route to a score above 300 with the bat. \u201cSince we\u2019re on a rain break,\u201d writes Steve Bloomfield. \u201cI thought you might fancy taking a look at this profile of Virat Kohli we\u2019ve got in the new issue of Prospect. Phil Collins wrote it and it\u2019s pretty good.\u201d *Right click / save to Pocket * \u201cThanks a lot for your interesting (and quite relaxed) coverage of the game,\u201d emails Vinayak Sapru. \u201cAs an Indian in the Middle East, I find myself at work on a Sunday afternoon surrounded by Pakistanis. I\u2019m quite enjoying gloating quietly at my desk while my colleagues follow the more stress inducing ball-by-ball commentaries.\u201d Thanks for being part of the mighty OBO fam. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the beards in the present day Indian team?\u201d asks Don Wilson. \u201cIn the era of Tendulkar, Ganguly, Dravid and Co, the only beard around was on Bhaji, now MS is the only clean shaven one, are they all just trying to emulate Kholi or what?\u201d That\u2019s a fine question. I\u2019ll ask Harsha Bhogle and get back to you. We do know that Virat is an influener though. We all saw this ad, I trust? A good suggestion for renaming the French Cut. \u201cIf it is a matter of luck for the incompetent, can we rename it Boris cut?\u201d asks Meghnad Desai. We must. Did everyone catch Marina Hyde\u2019s column yesterday? Goodness me. All the lines. I\u2019ll keep churning through my inbox, as we\u2019ll be back on soon. \u201cI\u2018ve been following the commentary from north of Toronto and can\u2019t help feeling India have left some runs on the table after the great start by Rohit in particular,\u201d writes Stephen Hodson. \u201cPakistan will struggle unless they can bide their time and preserve wickets in the reply. Makes for a compelling contest.\u201d I share that first view. With 150 on the board at the halfway mark, they will be at least a little bit disappointed not to hit 350. Pakistan almost pegged it back well. It\u2019s going to be that kind of afternoon. More emails, then. \u201cLoving the coverage as per usual!\u201d writes Seamus Whitehead. Thank you. FULL CREDIT to Tim de Lisle. It is very, very difficult to OBO a high-scoring ODI innings, especially a high-profile fixture with emails flooding in. He did a magnificent job. \u201cMy weekly six-a-side Sunday league takes place at the Trafford Sports Barn, a mere slog-sweep from the cricket today. As the goals flowed on the pitch we could hear the roars of the crowd pick up with uncanny timing. They were cheering for us weren\u2019t they?\u201d Tell us then, who won? Pop any in? \u201cWhether it will go the distance or not depends on which Pakistan shows up to bat,\u201d suggests Uma Venkatrama. \u201cThe one that is worse than an amateur player or the one that is an unstoppable force. I am hoping for the latter.\u201d I just want a game that is still alive, one way or another, at about 6pm. I\u2019m sorry. A quick round of emails, shall we? To begin: Abhijato Sensarma has a man crush on Yuvraj. Him and a billion others. What a player. \u201cReally can\u2019t top Pete Salmon\u2019s wonderful Kohli related earworm,\u201d writes Brian Withington, \u201cbut wanted to share my regret that we had not been treated to the portentous opening riffs of Led Zepelin\u2019s Kashmir at his arrival to the crease. (I\u2019m guessing it might have been considered a little insensitive given the wider geopolitical baggage.). Still gets my vote as the OBO anthem of choice for when rain stops play: Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face Stars fill my dream I\u2019m a traveller of both time and space To be where I have been Sit with elders of the gentle race This world has seldom seen They talk of days for which they sit and wait All will be revealed I think this came up the other day? We\u2019ve had a lot of rainy OBOs this week. \u201cThis is a bit prosaic, but what\u2019s the story with OT\u2019s temporary stand?\u201d asks Romeo. \u201cThey have it for concerts, I assume, and obviously for big games like this, but what do they do with the space when it isn\u2019t there? It must cost a lot to dismantle and then remantle, and apart from it being rather sad to see empty stands when Leicestershire come for a County Championship game and even the old man and his dog don\u2019t turn up, why do they ever remove it?\u201d I have a partial answer to that, via Will Macpherson, once from this parish: I better wrap up this post as I have some news to report. It\u2019s not good news. 50th over: India 336-5 (Shankar 15, Jadhav 9) Shankar shows his worth here in the final over, getting on one knee to loft Amir over extra cover with style for a one-bounce four after the left-armer started well. The 28-year-old is on World Cup debut, playing just his 10th ODI. Can he stick the landing? Not quite, shovelling one to long-on after Amir misdirected a wide. Jadhav faces up to the final ball of the innings with protection mostly on the off side rope. He can\u2019t bisect those sweepers though, one to cover his lot. Nine from the 50th. Pakistan need 337. 49th over: India 327-5 (Shankar 9, Jadhav 7) Technology shows no edge from Kohli despite the fact that the Indian captain looked to.... walk? There was no out signal from the umpire, according to the telly. Anyway, Wahab now to bowl the penultimate over, beginning with a sprayed delivery, repeated outside the tram trams on the off side. When Jadhav does get something to hit he launches it over extra cover into the gap for four. \u201cHe gets in line and hits through the line,\u201d says Ganguly on TV. He gives the strike back to Shankar, who hacks hooks two out in the same direction then finishes with one to the sweeper at cover. 12 off it. I have a great many emails already. It\u2019s that kind of fixture. Be patient with me. 48th over: India 315-5 (Shankar 5, Jadhav 1) What a superb job Amir has done throughout the Indian innings, across three spells. Efficient and effective, he has the figures of 3/38 with the 50th over ahead of him from the Jimmy Anderson End. Kohli bounced out by Amir! He\u2019s been Pakistan\u2019s best bowler by a mile today and now has picked up the Indian skipper hooking, a little edge going through to his opposing number Sarfraz. The green machine have pegged this back nicely. 47th over: India 311-4 (Kohli 75, Shankar 4) Wahab to Shankar from the first ball after the rain delay, squeezed over cover for one. Now to Kohli, he goes with the slower ball bouncer but it is just over his head by far enough to be called a wide. Rebowling the final delivery, Kohli has enough space to prod the ball from fifth stump past the short third man down to the rope. Excellent placement. So, six runs from two balls - the ideal re-start. \u201cMention of the OBO going back to 2003 is as good an excuse as any to bring up this classic from the lovable Scott Murray,\u201d emails Ben Christopher Jackson. \u201cHe certainly was a pioneer of the medium and now excuse me while I go back to hitting F5 on the Golf page to see if he\u2019s started his US Open fourth round updates yet.\u201d Magnificent. I\u2019m reading every word of that during the (brief) innings break. Right, so where were we? Well, India are 305/4. As we left for rain, Shankar (3) was given out caught behind, the decision overturned by DRS. Wahab is the man with the ball in his hand, four balls into the 47th over. Kohli is up the other end on 71 from 62 balls, already passing 11,000 ODI runs in this innings - the fastest to do so by some 63 innings, I\u2019m told. As you do. The players are now back on the field so we can get this party (re)started. PLAY! If this does go the distance, it is going to be a marathon stint. So please do keep me company. You know the deal - email, twitter, ICQ, Friendster. Thanks, Tim. As you can see in the header, I bring very good news: we\u2019re starting again in ten minutes! No overs lost either, with lunch reduced to 15 minutes. Now for the big news. Adam has finished his lunch. He texts to say THE COVERS ARE COMING OFF, so it\u2019s over to him. Thanks for your company, your wisdom on Indo-Pak relations, your man-crushes and your unexpected compliments. It\u2019s been a pleasure as ever, and the 2019 World Cup, like this game, is still not quite half over. For some reason, everyone\u2019s being nice today. So look away now if you don\u2019t want to see the OBO blow smoke up its own keyboard. \u201cHello!\u201d Hello Hilla Kr\u00fcger! \u201cThank you so much for your excellent coverage!\u201d No, thank you! \u201cDon\u2019t miss watching the match at all as I prefer reading what all of you have to say, sitting in Switzerland!\u201d It\u2019s always good to hear from a reader with an umlaut. \u201cTop of the morning to you!\u201d And to you, Anurag Mathur. \u201cThanks for making this so enjoyable. Am out on errands so getting to read your commentary live in every break. Sigh! Wish commentators were as exciting (and funny). You bring the fun back into a game that is converted into a spreadsheet on most channels!\u201d To be fair, the TV commentators are a help to us OBOers \u2013 both because they spot things, and because, as you say, they don\u2019t tend to play it for laughs. More on the Harrow whatever. \u201cThe Harrow Cut,\u201d says John Starbuck firmly, \u201cis obviously a term used by boys from other public schools. It is also variously known as a Derbyshire Cut, a Staffordshire Cut and a Chinese Cut. The point is that it is a scoring shot unintended by the batsman, hence by a lucky semi-incompetent: very insulting and not to be used in these days. We ought to be able to come up with something better.\u201d Hmmm. The Chinese cut clearly has the potential to be offensive, but the others are OK, aren\u2019t they? Just a little touch of local colour. If any Harrovians are reading this, perhaps they can tell us whether they take umbrage. \u201cDiplomatic incident,\u201d says Reg Gorczynski (13:55). \u201cThe rain is more likely to cause India some angst\u2026if it lasts a reasonable time, Pakistan may get a free pass at a short \u2018big bash\u2019 when they were quite unlikely to surpass what was looking to be a very big 50-over total.\u201d Good point. It would be so great for the tournament if Pakistan could somehow pull it off. So far the big four \u2013 Australia, India, New Zealand and England \u2013 have dropped only six points between them, whereas the other six teams have dropped an average of six points each. The table is like a plane that has first class and economy, but no business class. Time for a man crush. \u201cNoticed during the India v Australia game,\u201d says Pete Salmon, \u201cthat the OBO riffed about players\u2019 names that gave them earworms. Couldn\u2019t participate as I was at the game, but mine is not only an earworm but also reflects the man crush I think any sensible chap would have: Kohli, Kohli, Kohli, Kohli I\u2019m begging of you please don\u2019t take my man Kohli, Kohli, Kohli, Kohli Please don\u2019t take him just because you can \u201cGet flutters just humming it.\u201d There\u2019s an entire drag act waiting to happen in that stanza. Kohli Parton, a sensation on the Edinburgh Fringe. \u201cNext update 2.30pm,\u201d says Adam Collins, texting me from the back half of the pantomime horse. \u201cSo I will grab a quick plate and bring it back to my seat in the press box.\u201d There is such a thing as a free lunch, but only for cricket writers who actually go to the game. Some more correspondence. \u201cCan someone please explain,\u201d asks Nigel Smith, \u201cwhat a Harrow shot is?\u201d It\u2019s a thin inside edge, which takes the ball close to the stumps, but often goes for four because professional captains don\u2019t post long stops. Why it\u2019s named after a famous old school, I\u2019m not sure \u2013 over to the hive mind. Time for some Dad stuff. I\u2019ve been neglecting the fact that it\u2019s Father\u2019s Day, but Brian Withington has stepped up to the plate. \u201cHaving just tucked in to a delightful Father\u2019s Day brunch,\u201d he purrs, \u201cI was thrilled to open one of my cards and discover that I have finally made it successfully into my \u2018favourite\u2019 daughter\u2019s all-time top two parents list.\u201d Ha. We all need a sarky daughter. \u201cNow enjoying the obligatory celebratory lemon sherbert whilst awaiting the impending feast of Powerplay 3. Bring it on.\u201d My kids didn\u2019t let me down either. My daughter said she\u2019d be following the OBO even though she only understands about 12 per cent of it. With precision like that, love, you really should be a cricket fan. My son said \u201cHappy Father\u2019s Day Dad. Hope you don\u2019t cause a diplomatic incident.\u201d While the TV umpire was rocking and rolling, the on-field umpires decided the drizzle had turned to proper rain, so they\u2019ve taken the players off. There\u2019s a gap between bat and ball that is so wide, it could be the gap between India\u2019s politicians and Pakistan\u2019s. Off Wahab. There was a noise, but Shankar seems confident... 46th over: India 302-4 (Kohli 70, Shankar 1) A wicket and only five runs off the over from Amir, who now has the figures he deserves \u2013 8-0-34-2. And at least Pakistan have forced Shankar to bat. But Kohli motors on and the 300 comes up, with the third hundred taking only 68 balls, whereas the first two were just over 100 apiece. India have already won this, haven\u2019t they? At last, the wickets are coming in pairs. Amir strikes again, by scrambling the seam and taking the edge. It\u2019s all about Kohli now. 45th over: India 297-3 (Kohli 67, Dhoni 1) How would you or I bowl in the face of a barrage like this? The way Hassan bowls now, sending consecutive balls down the leg side, which Kohli has only to glance for four. Oh dear. And Kohli has gone to 11,000 ODI runs in 222 innings, the fastest in history. 44th over: India 286-3 (Kohli 56, Dhoni 0) Amir returns, with enough overs to stay on for the rest of the innings. A flick for two takes Kohli to fifty, which is greeted the way a triple-hundred would be by any other crowd. Amir deserves a wicket, and it\u2019s worth getting rid of the dangerous Pandya, but Pakistani hearts won\u2019t be lifted by the sight of Old Man Dhoni. \u201cYou\u2019re serving the OBO with pizzazz nowadays, then, Tim?\u201d scoffs Phil Sawyer. \u201cI\u2019ll have olives and mushrooms on mine, ta.\u201d Pandya gets a little too Mr Whippy, flicking more than on-driving and giving Babar Azam another straightforward catch. A decent cameo, though: without being at his murderous best, he used up only 19 balls. 43rd over: India 274-2 (Kohli 48, Pandya 22) Pandya, who can be so destructive, has started quietly \u2013 until now, as he misjudges Hassan\u2019s slower ball and edges for six. He misses the next one, also slow, but then whips a would-be yorker for four to long leg. Pandya stands deep in the crease, whereas Kohli stands outside it, so for the bowlers, it\u2019s like when Hayden and Langer were opening for Australia. Testing. 42nd over: India 261-2 (Kohli 47, Pandya 10) Kohli has such exceptional antennae that he is now tuning into these words from the middle. Spotting a fuller ball from Wahab, he lofts him into the deep for four. That\u2019s his most imperious moment so far today. 41st over: India 254-2 (Kohli 41, Pandya 9) Six off the over from Hassan, not bad at this stage. Kohli has accelerated as expected, taking 25 off his last 24 balls; now he needs to go even faster. 40th over: India 245-2 (Kohli 37, Pandya 4) Kohli, sniffing the match situation, belts the first ball of Shadab\u2019s over for four. \u201cIs anyone,\u201d wonders Peter Williams, \u201cgoing to produce a highlight video of Sarfaraz\u2019s facial expressions from the World Cup so far? Could go down well on YouTube.\u201d Very true. If he was an actor, he would get plenty of work as the downtrodden servant in Shakespeare. 39th over: India 238-2 (Kohli 30, Pandya 4) Sharma departed berating himself. He had seen the field change \u2013 Kohli pointed it out \u2013 so his irritation was to do with failing to clear the man. Any minute now, he will calm down again and realise that he has played one of the all-time great World Cup innings \u2013 140 off only 113 balls, setting the stage superbly for Kohli and Pandya. He\u2019s given it away! After being so good for so long, Sharma switches off, doesn\u2019t spot the man at short fine leg, and sends a lap-ramp hybrid straight to him. \u201cToo funky,\u201d says Michael Clarke, sounding, possibly for the first time, like Prince. 38th over: India 230-1 (Sharma 136, Kohli 30) Wahab\u2019s over goes for ten as Sharma flick-pulls him for four. The measure of Sharma\u2019s mastery is that he has outscored Kohli by two to one, 61 to 30. 37th over: India 220-1 (Sharma 128, Kohli 29) If you can hear anything above the hubbub, it\u2019s the slam of a bolt across a stable door: Imad does have a slip now, so the batsmen content themselves with milking him. It\u2019s all one big agricultural metaphor. Here\u2019s Krishnamoorthy, back for a second spell. \u201cRohit Sharma has singlehandedly converted the \u2018important toss to win\u2019 to harakiri,\u201d he observes. \u201cAnd Uma Nair [26th over] is spot on. I nowadays prefer OBO and MBM over the actual telecast. Rob Barnay Barry Paul Will Tim .... you guys are a great panel.\u201d Thanks, but there are more of us than that. 36th over: India 215-1 (Sharma 126, Kohli 26) Sharma plays that upper cut of his again, slapping Wahab for four. And that\u2019s drinks, with the Indians even more on top than they were when they last took a swig of Lucozade. 35th over: India 206-1 (Sharma 119, Kohli 24) Imad bowls the perfect slow-left-arm ball to Sharma, turning, taking the edge, and presenting an easy catch to first slip \u2013 except that there isn\u2019t one. In the dressing-room, Hardik Pandya is padded up and practising his big hits. 34th over: India 199-1 (Sharma 113, Kohli 23) Shadab gets one to lift and turn, which reminds you that Shane Warne loved Old Trafford. But it\u2019s also ominous for Pakistan, as they have to face two wrist-spinners later. Next ball, quite unruffled, Sharma sweeps for four, bringing the blade down like an executioner. \u201cAmongst all the \u2018Let\u2019s at least make this a contest\u2019 talk,\u201d says Gary Naylor, \u201cwe should note that Pakistan crossed 340 three times out of four in the recent ODI series vs England. No score is unchaseable these days for the circular reason that no score is considered unchaseable.\u201d In general, agreed; but in this World Cup, no score of 250 has been chaseable so far. And Pakistan\u2019s World Cup record against India is, unfortunately, dire. 33rd over: India 191-1 (Sharma 106, Kohli 22) Sarfaraz wants to keep four overs of Amir up his sleeve, umps permitting, so he goes back to Imad, who keeps the batsmen down to four singles. 32nd over: India 187-1 (Sharma 104, Kohli 20) Shadab continues and so does the milking. The fifty partnership comes up at a run a ball. It\u2019s been serene. If you don\u2019t take two wickets in quick succession, you\u2019ve got hardly any chance \u2013 but Pakistan, when they take two, are apt to grab six, so it\u2019s too early to write them off. 31st over: India 181-1 (Sharma 102, Kohli 16) After letting Sharma have his moment, Kohli looks to dominate for the first time \u2013 a full ball from Amir, a glorious off-drive, on the up. His 16 has come off 21 balls; the next 16 won\u2019t take so long. 30th over: India 172-1 (Sharma 100, Kohli 9) Just when Wahab was offering a threat, he is taken off, as Shadab returns. The noise on 99 is massive, never mind the hundred, which comes up as Sharma rocks back to cut for an easy single. He gets a hug from Kohli and a din and a half from the crowd, which he fully deserves (a) for making 100 off only 85 balls, and (b) for keeping his head where many a strong person might turn to jelly. \u201cGreetings from Sale,\u201d says Guy Hornsby, \u201cwhere I can report the sun is peeking out. Alongside a dry afternoon, the one thing this match needs is a contest, and you feel without wickets this could get sticky for Pakistan. Predictable posturing aside, this is what cricket is all about.\u201d 29th over: India 165-1 (Sharma 95, Kohli 7) Amir returns, with a slip and gully \u2013 better strategy from Sarfaraz \u2013 and beats Kohli by scrambling the seam and pushing the ball across him. Amir has 0-9 from five overs: it\u2019s as if he\u2019s playing in a different match. 28th over: India 164-1 (Sharma 94, Kohli 7) Wahab, going round the wicket now, keeps Kohli honest by angling it in, and raps him on the gloves with a well-aimed lifter. The predictor is saying 351 now. Here\u2019s Brian Withington again, striking a personal note. \u201cVenkat\u2019s heartfelt plea [19th over] made an exiled East Ender who used to live nervously in the Rotherhithe DMZ really appreciate that there\u2019s a decent river as well as the unlikely prospect of promotion/relegation between Millwall and West Ham football clubs \u2013 and that neither set of supporters has yet acquired nuclear missile launch codes.\u201d 27th over: India 160-1 (Sharma 92, Kohli 6) Sharma plays the shot of the day so far, an upper cut for six off Hassan. If he put any effort into that, he certainly wasn\u2019t going to show it. Kohli, meanwhile, gets a thick inside edge and scrambles two. If you didn\u2019t know his name, you\u2019d think he was very much the junior partner here. 26th over: India 151-1 (Sharma 85, Kohli 4) Wahab\u2019s over goes for a regulation five. And here\u2019s an email from Uma Nair, pulsating like the match itself. \u201cPakistan and India have these full-throttled accelerating two-to-tango duels. While our histories overlap and overwhelm, what stands out is an unwritten admiration and respect for great players and worthy records that will create their own pages of history on both sides of the board. Here am I, an art critic and curator, watching the adrenalin-pumped stands full of visitors who belong to either nation or even well-heeled Brits who love watching the alchemy pour out from fields to stands. But I must say I watch the game and read your notes with great relish. It gives me something to savour because somehow the commentators don\u2019t have your pizazz!!\u201d Ah thanks. That\u2019s the OBO, serving pizazz since, when was it, 2003? 25th over: India 146-1 (Sharma 81, Kohli 3) Now it\u2019s pace at both ends as Hafeez too is ostracised for a bad first over. Hassan Ali draws an inside edge from Sharma, but it\u2019s another Harrow squirt for four. And Kohli, of course, is instantly at home, with a cut for one and a pull for two. At the half-way stage, India are well on top but not absolutely lording it. \u201cJust catching up with the coverage,\u201d says Brian Withington, \u201cI see that in over 14 Sarfaraz \u2018shoes some faith\u2019 in Shadab. Just wondering whether that was a petite size eight belief or the size 14 Derek Pringle specials with the cut-out toes?\u201d Nice one: putting the stiletto in, not the boot. 24th over: India 136-1 (Sharma 75, Kohli 0) Senior or not, Shoaib found himself ditched after one over. Wahab returned for the first taste of pace since the 10th over, got a warning for running on the middle of the pitch, but made that vital incision. For Pakistan, blessed relief. For India, better to lose Rahul than Sharma. At last! An apparently innocuous delivery, but Rahul chips it straight to Babar at extra cover. Friends, Indians, cricket-lovers, cover your ears \u2013 it\u2019s time for Kohli. 23rd over: India 134-0 (Rahul 57, Sharma 74) You wait an hour and a half for an elderly part-time off-spinner, then two come along at once. And each of them goes for 11 off his first over. Mohammad Hafeez tosses it up and Rahul helps himself to six, inside-out over wide long-off. The carnage has resumed. 22nd over: India 123-0 (Rahul 51, Sharma 69) Now we do have a change of bowling, and it is an elderly part-timer coming on \u2013 Shoaib Malik, playing his 287th ODI. He shows none of that experience by dropping short to Rahul, who pulls him for six to reach fifty off 69 balls. It\u2019s been old-school. \u201cCouldn\u2019t agree more with Venkat,\u201d says Aditya Anchuri, picking up on the 19th over. \u201cIt\u2019s made worse in this day and age of social media. People using an innocent cricket match to further their petty political agendas.\u201d 21st over: India 112-0 (Rahul 43, Sharma 66) Rahul gets out of his rut by milking Imad. A tweet from Gary Naylor. \u201cEffigy manufacturing companies share prices rising on the Lahore Stock Exchange,\u201d he chortles. \u201cThe deluxe Sarfaraz edition and the ever popular Shoaib model look the best investments as it stands now. Though you might not want to throw out the Hardik Pandya ones just yet.\u201d 20th over: India 105-0 (Rahul 39, Sharma 63) KL Rahul has been playing second fiddle, and now he\u2019s in danger of falling silent altogether \u2013 his 39 has come off 64 balls, and when Shadab dishes up a full toss, he can only reverse-sweep it to the man at backward point. The last eight overs have gone for just 26, yet India are still in charge. 19th over: India 103-0 (Rahul 38, Sharma 62) Sarfaraz decides to stick rather than twist, and it goes well: only two off Imad\u2019s over. The run-rate has slowed, but that won\u2019t worry the Indians, who tend to start slowly anyway. Pakistan need three wickets in the next 20 minutes. \u201cAfternoon Tim.\u201d Afternoon Venkat. \u201cI\u2019m writing from Bangalore, India, to tell you that I dread India-Pakistan matches. It\u2019s all very well to talk about the noise and the atmosphere and the excitement. But it\u2019s all backed by 70 plus years of religious tension, violence, bloodshed, jingoism, posturing, nuclear threats, mass migrations, war and the cynical political capital made out of all the above. I wish those watching \u2013 live or on TV \u2013 would make every effort to downplay the tension and use this match as a symbol of normalcy rather than rivalry. A forlorn hope. But despite my dread, I think I\u2019ll try and follow the match :)\u201d That is a great email. 18th over: India 100-0 (Rahul 37, Sharma 60) Rahul pushes Shadab comfortably into the covers to bring up the hundred partnership, something no Indian openers have managed before in six World Cup games against Pakistan. And India won all those matches. That\u2019s drinks, and you don\u2019t need me to tell you who\u2019s on top. 17th over: India 99-0 (Rahul 36, Sharma 60) Five singles off Imad this time, plus a wide. Sarfaraz needs to do something fast, even if it means bringing on an elderly part-timer. \u201cI was in India in 2003,\u201d says Philip Mallett, \u201cwhen India beat Pakistan thanks largely to 98 from Tendulkar. For the next fortnight, every hotel I stayed in showed the whole game again on huge television screens, surrounded by jubilant Indians cheering every ball. Mind you, on the day of the match there were no waiters to be seen in the restaurants. It would have been a good day to carry out a bank robbery.\u201d 16th over: India 93-0 (Rahul 33, Sharma 58) Sharma, after catching his breath, gets going again with a late cut for four off Shadab. That was so delicate as to be almost sadistic. 15th over: India 87-0 (Rahul 32, Sharma 53) Four singles off Imad. \u201cWarning,\u201d says Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cPut on a \u2018Hit-Man\u2019 bandana... I have been keeping a close eye on my personal favourite from the very start, Rohit \u2018Double Ton Specialist\u2019 Sharma... You should too!\u201d 14th over: India 83-0 (Rahul 30, Sharma 51) Sarfaraz shoes some faith in Shadab, who repays it by restricting the batsmen to three singles. But still the best hope of a breakthrough seems to lie with a run-out. The batsmen are in more danger from themselves than from the bowlers. 13th over: India 80-0 (Rahul 28, Sharma 50) Imad restores order, conceding just a single. And the sun comes out! Manchester, you\u2019ve surpassed yourself. 12th over: India 79-0 (Rahul 27, Sharma 50) Sarfaraz sees that turn and plumps for spin at both ends, but instantly regrets it. Shadab comes on and it all goes horribly wrong \u2013 a long-hop cut for four, a full-toss clipped for six. That\u2019s 17 off the over and an excellent fifty for Sharma, from only 35 balls: the stuff of match-winners. 11th over: India 62-0 (Rahul 22, Sharma 38) Rahul attacks Imad, first delicately, with the finest of sweeps, then clumsily but effectively, with a mistimed chip over midwicket. There\u2019s another sniff of a run-out as Shadab\u2019s flying throw goes wide of the stumps with the batsman stranded. And in between, Imad gets one to straighten, sharply. It\u2019s all happening, and we haven\u2019t even seen Kohli yet. 10th over: India 53-0 (Rahul 14, Sharma 37) Wahab keeps it tight until the last ball, which is spanked wide of third man by Sharma, to celebrate his reprieve. And that\u2019s a fine fifty partnership, nice and composed apart from the one rush of blood. Of a run-out \u2013 Sharma went for a second, Rahul sent him back, all the man at midwicket had to do was throw to the keeper\u2019s end, and he threw to the bowler\u2019s end. That\u2019s a shocker. 9th over: India 46-0 (Rahul 12, Sharma 32) Sarfaraz removes Amir, before Oxenford does, and decides it\u2019s time for some spin. Imad Wasim starts with a wide but keps it tight thereafter. The score predictor is giving India 342, which could make for a very dull afternoon: in this World Cup, every team making 250 batting first has won. \u201cMorning Tim.\u201d Morning Simon McMahon. \u201cThe atmosphere at Old Trafford looks and sounds electric, even on the telly. Reminds me a bit of the Cowdenbeath v Cove Rangers play off final second leg at Central Park a couple of seasons ago. The tension that day was off the scale.\u201d 8th over: India 42-0 (Rahul 10, Sharma 31) Hassan had to go, so Sarfaraz sends for Wahab Riaz and it\u2019s left-arm quicks at both ends. Sharma\u2019s bonanza continues when Wahab tries a bouncer that just needs helping round the corner for four. \u201cFantastic atmosphere at this game,\u201d says Jonathan, \u201ctogether with some top-level WHAT ARE YOU DOING with Amir running onto the pitch so often. But do you know why there are so many empty seats visible in some parts of the ground?\u201d I don\u2019t. At a guess, it could be the queues for security checks. 7th over: India 35-0 (Rahul 8, Sharma 26) Just a couple of quick singles and a bye off Amir. The day belongs to Rohit Sharma so far, just ahead of umpire Oxenford. 6th over: India 32-0 (Rahul 7, Sharma 25) Hassan drops too short and wide and Sharma tucks in, cutting with abandon, in the air but safely. And then he goes one better with a front-foot pull for the first six of the day. Hassan has gone for 26 already. Meanwhile Bob O\u2019Hara is picking up on the chat from the 1st over. \u201cI think what Krishnamoorthy was trying to say is that #INDvPAK is almost as big as a Roses match.\u201d 5th over: India 20-0 (Rahul 6, Sharma 14) Rahul takes on Amir\u2019s bouncer and pulls it, handsomely, for four. Wasim Akram, on commentary, reckons that Amir\u2019s front foot is landing too wide, reducing his ability to swing it back in. And now Amir gets a second warning from umpire Oxenford for running on the pink zone. One more and he\u2019s off. But Amir still produces a slower ball, a cutter, that beats Rahul. His figures are impeccable: 3-1-6-0. \u201cGreat that the game has at least started on time,\u201d says Anand. \u201cNervous about India batting first in cloudy conditions. I do hope that Kohli\u2019s decision to bat first in the warm-up against NZ was in preparation of a situation like this...\u201d 4th over: India 16-0 (Rahul 2, Sharma 14) Hassan overpitches and Sharma plays the shot of the day, an effortless push for four to mid-off\u2019s right. Hassan bounces back with a shorter ball that seams away and beats the bat. 3rd over: India 11-0 (Rahul 1, Sharma 10) Facing Amir, Sharma almost plays on as he tries a late leave. He\u2019s standing outside his crease, Kohli-style, so Amir fires in a bouncer, too high to be dangerous. Amir is then warned for running on the middle of the pitch, although he only encroaches when he\u2019s a long way down. \u201cBit harsh,\u201d says Nasser Hussain. \u201cThis is the Cavaliers vs the Roundheads,\u201d reckons Risha Mohyeddin. \u201cBring it on!! Although we all know how that ended...\u201d 2nd over: India 9-0 (Rahul 0, Sharma 9) Runs! Off the inside edge. Hassan Ali\u2019s nip-backer defeats Rohit Sharma, but he manages a Harrow prod. When Hassan strays onto the pads, Sharma scores the first runs off the middle with an easy flick for two, followed by the same again for three. Hassan\u2019s first over, like Amir\u2019s, went from good to poor. 1st over: India 0-0 (Rahul 0, Sharma 0) Mohammad Amir takes centre stage and he\u2019s learnt his lines, and lengths \u2013 first two balls in the channel, third one fuller and swinging back in. KL Rahul, watchful, blocks them all. The next three he can watch all the way into Sarfaraz\u2019s gloves. Amir glanced up and thanked the gods of swing after the third ball, but went rather flat after that. Still, a maiden. The noise is unceasing \u2013 imagine what it\u2019ll be liked when we have a run. \u201cGood morning Tim.\u201d Good morning Krishnamoorthy. \u201cYou needed to have spent your formative years in the subcontinent to understand the nuances of an Ind-Pak match. A school-going kid in India will say Pakistan on being asked the opposite of India. That is how deep rooted the animosity is. The religious divide poisons it further as religion poisons everything it touches. It is bigger than El Clasico, North London Derby, Manchester Derby, Ashes, UCL final and London Marathon put together. There is no logic or rationale. To put it in context, my 80+ grandmom (who can\u2019t tell a kookaburra from a baseball or a golf ball) says \u201dIt does not matter if India loses all the matches but it must BEAT Pakistan (accompanied with a headmaster administering a spanking mime). The rest of the nation is not any better. By tonight V Kohli will be bigger than Imran and Tendulkar put together or his effigies will be burnt in front of his Delhi home.\u201d Never mind the weather, what about the climate? My colleague Tanya Aldred is at the game, with her campaigning hat on \u2013 do follow @TheNextText on Twitter. The word is there are no water jugs, just plastic bottles, plugging a sponsor. Come on ICC, you can do better than that. And here\u2019s an email from Aditi Prabhudesai. \u201cMuch hot air has been spewed forth over the perfidious English rain. With thousands of Indians and Pakistanis jetting in to watch today\u2019s encounter, one would do well to consider other environmental issues. Climate change has the potential to disrupt cricket. I believe temperatures had touched 50C during the last Ashes. Then there\u2019s air pollution which marred the Delhi Test played between India and Sri Lanka. There\u2019s a good chance cricket would have to be moved indoors in the dystopian future. If and when a carbon tax is introduced, cricket audiences would be limited to locals and the well heeled. Rain, I think, would be the least of our concerns.\u201d 1 India\u2019s opening pair. They\u2019re usually immense, but Shikhar Dhawan is out with a broken thumb \u2013 can KL Rahul step up? And can VJ Shankar fill Rahul\u2019s shoes at No.4, or will India rue the day they left Rishabh Pant at home? 2 Kohli against left-arm quicks. He only averages 50 against them, according to a Sky stat box, so he becomes just about mortal. Memo to Mohammad Amir: aim for his heel. 3 The spinners. We\u2019re in England, in the north, on a grey day, in a dank summer, and both these teams have gone with two spinners \u2013 Chahal and Yadav for India, Imad Wasim and Shadab Khan for Pakistan. Three of the four are wrist-spinners (the exception being Imad). And both these batting line-ups can play slow bowling in their sleep, so something\u2019s got to give. India 1 Rohit Sharma, 2 KL Rahul, 3 Virat Kohli (capt), 4 VJ Shankar, 5 MS Dhoni (wkt), 6 Hardik Pandya, 7 Kedar Jadhav, 8 Bhuvneshwar Kumar, 9 Kuldeep Yadav, 10 Yuzvendra Chahal, 11 Jasprit Bumrah. Pakistan 1 Imam-ul-Haq, 2 Fakhar Zaman, 3 Babar Azam, 4 Mohammad Hafeez, 5 Sarfaraz Ahmed (capt, wkt), 6 Shoaib Malik, 7 Imad Wasim, 8 Shadab Khan, 9 Hassan Ali, 10 Wahab Riaz, 11 Mohammad Amir. Sarfaraz Ahmed calls tails, it is, and he opts to bowl first, because of the forecast rain. Virat Kohli says he would have done the same. Morning everyone and welcome to the World Cup match with the most superlatives around its neck. It\u2019s the noisiest, niggliest, most intense, most watched game there can be, unless India and Pakistan meet again in the final, as they did two years ago, also on English turf. The last match I covered, England v West Indies 48 hours ago, was under-hyped. That\u2019s not a problem today. This is England, so we have to start by talking about the weather. According to the Met Office, there\u2019s rain around but it\u2019s not expected to be serious until lunchtime. We should get a game, albeit a truncated one. Both teams want to win in the same way Arsenal want to beat Spurs, or a six-year-old wants a bigger slice of cake than her eight-year-old sister. But only one of the teams needs to win. India have started authoritatively, beating Australia, dropping a point only to the rain. Pakistan have started characteristically, listless one day (against West Indies), lethal the next (against England). Currently ninth out of ten, caught between Bangladesh and Afghanistan, they really need a victory today. In fact, they need it so badly they\u2019ve gone to the trouble of electing a World Cup-winning captain as their prime minister. The form guide is interesting. In all their one-day international meetings, Pakistan are well ahead, by 73 wins to 54. But in the World Cup, where they have met six times, it\u2019s 6-0 to India. And the Indians may still be smarting from the 2017 Champions Trophy, when they won the group match easily, only to be humbled in the final. Whichever way you look at it, it\u2019s a game to savour. It begins, clouds permitting, at 10.30am BST, in about an hour.",

      "bodyText": "Medical authorities in Britain have launched an internal inquiry after unsafe medicines for common conditions were stolen from Italian hospitals, sold to UK pharmacies and potentially reached patients. Criminal gangs linked to the mafia infiltrated the NHS supply chain in 2014, which resulted in prescription medicines for prostate cancer, epilepsy and schizophrenia being imported into the UK. More than 10,000 units of stolen drugs had arrived in the UK by 2014, according to an investigation by Channel 4 Dispatches, with four types of unsafe medicine sold to pharmacies. The medicines were not counterfeit, but given the time they spent outside of the regulated supply chain they were classed as \u201cfalsified\u201d. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which did not alert the wider public at the time, said it believed the risk to public health was low since they were legitimate medicines. However, during a review of its 2014 investigation into reports of stolen medicines sold for use in the UK, the regulator found that records concerning the probe were incomplete \u2013 prompting an internal review to ensure it was adequately protecting the regulated supply chain. \u201cIn 2014, following reports of medicines being stolen in Italy and sold to the UK, we undertook an investigation and acted to make sure products on the UK market were safe,\u201d said MHRA chief executive Ian Hudson. \u201cWe received this information more than a year after the thefts occurred. \u201cIn addition to this case, the MHRA has seized falsified medicines from the regulated supply chain only nine times in the last decade, and there is no evidence any of these medicines made it to patients.\u201d A well-known high street pharmacy chain said to have stocked and prescribed the medicines is to be named on Monday by Dispatches. The first indication that the stolen Italian medicines had entered the UK\u2019s supply chain came in March 2014, when a German pharmaceutical wholesaler purchased breast cancer drugs which were found to have been tampered with and had become ineffective. The Italian regulator investigated a number of major thefts between 2011 and 2014 that saw thousands of critical medicines for serious illnesses go missing, later entering official medical supply chains across Europe. It is understood that the MHRA wrote to wholesalers and asked them to ensure the affected products did not enter the supply chain, and to quarantine such medicines if necessary and contact those they supplied requesting they do the same. The MHRA does not hold prescribing data, and has no direct evidence that patients received these medicines. However, it acknowledged that \u201cthere is a possibility that some of these medicines reached patient level\u201d. Former Liberal Democrat health minister Norman Lamb led calls for a review. \u201cPeople first of all need to be told that they may have received medicines that came through an illegal route,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what I find extraordinary is that there hasn\u2019t been openness about this having happened.\u201d All medicines in the UK have carried a unique barcode since February 2019, which allows their veracity to be authenticated after the MHRA implemented the EU Falsified Medicines Directive.",

Without the excellent Endler in goal for Chile, the US could have scored five or six They should have got four, but Lloyd missed a penalty.</p> <p>Press, Ertz and Lloyd were good for the US, although we knew how strong they are before the game. Of the subs, McDonald did enough to suggest she could be worth a start later in the tournament. But the big question mark for the US - their defence - remains. Thailand and Chile simply have not offered enough in attack for the defenders to be tested. Against Sweden, who beat the US at the 2016 Olympics, that may well change. <br></p> <p>For me, the player of the match was Endler, who kept the score respectable. She was commanding in the box, claiming crosses well and her save off a Press header in the second-half was the best I have seen in this tournament.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d06820a8f08374cc578f3be\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-16T17:54:13.094Z\">6.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Full-time: USA 3-0 Chile.

And put them on course for a potential clash with hosts France in the quarter-finals. Jon Tupper thinks there will only be one winner in that match: \u201cFrance\u2019s speed on the wings, and strength up the middle with Renard and Henry, has a huge possibility for sending the Americans a huge loss,\u201d he writes. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-2019/overview\">You can see the latest standings here</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d0673058f08532f138d2c7c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-16T16:54:57.226Z\">5.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Half-time thoughts: </strong></p> <p>1) The US have shown that even their second-string attack is capable of taking lesser teams apart.

      "bodyText": "And the report from today\u2019s game is up and running now for your reading pleasure. Thanks for your emails and tweets today: Post-amble: A solid performance from the US, who fielded a weakened side. Without the excellent Endler in goal for Chile, the US could have scored five or six They should have got four, but Lloyd missed a penalty. Press, Ertz and Lloyd were good for the US, although we knew how strong they are before the game. Of the subs, McDonald did enough to suggest she could be worth a start later in the tournament. But the big question mark for the US - their defence - remains. Thailand and Chile simply have not offered enough in attack for the defenders to be tested. Against Sweden, who beat the US at the 2016 Olympics, that may well change. For me, the player of the match was Endler, who kept the score respectable. She was commanding in the box, claiming crosses well and her save off a Press header in the second-half was the best I have seen in this tournament. Lloyd has one last attempt - a header that flies wide. And that\u2019s the last action of the game. 90 min +4: Galaz is booked - for an apparent elbow. Although she claims she was the elbowed rather than the elbowee. 90 min + 3: Long needs to be careful. She hacks at Zamora\u2019s shins - she is already on a yellow but the ref only issues a warning. 90 min+2: Naeher touches the ball! A Chile free-kick drifts through to her and she picks it up. I guess - if we\u2019re being very generous - that could count as a shot. 90 min: Would a part of the US want their defence to have been tested a little more in this match? As it is, they are going into playing some very good teams with their defenders receiving very little in-game action. Five minutes of added time. 88 min: Chile are still searching for their first shot of the game, which isn\u2019t a huge endorsement of the competitiveness of this match. Pardo comes on for Lara - maybe the sub can provide something for Chile. 85 min: \u201cThat\u2019s a borderline penalty call but the line is part of the area so if the foul takes place on the line it is in the area,\u201d says Rick McGahey via email. \u201cChilean keeper once more steps up so it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d 84 min: If Lloyd had scored that penalty, she would have had a hat-trick in her last two World Cup starts. She is shaking her head - possibly as she thinks about that penalty, or maybe because she has remembered she left the TV on back in her hotel room. 82 min: Sonnett comes on for Dahlkemper, meaning every outfield US player has now appeared at this World Cup. And we\u2019re only in the second game. VAR check! The officials check to see if there was a foul in the box after Press\u2019s free-kick. And there was contact on the very edge of the area. It was marginal at best, but no matter Lloyd has a chance for her hat-trick. And she misses! She sends it wide to Endler\u2019s right. 77 min: The announced crowd is apparently higher than the capacity of Parc Des Princes. Maybe they included the players? I mean, they are there. Press, one of the 45,000 odd in the stadium lines up her free-kick around 30-yards out. Chile clear. 74 min: US win their 134,598th corner of the game. Davidson steps up to take but it evades everyone Chilean, US and anyone else who may have wandered on to the pitch. Lloyd sets up Press shortly afterwards but Endler denies her again - this time off her legs. 73 min: McDonald hurls in one of her long throws. It comes to Lloyd and her looping header lobs over Endler but pops off the top of the bar. 70 min: The US win their 13th corner. Press takes and Endler punches clear from a pack of players. Chile are yet to have an attack of note this half, so we still don\u2019t know how the US cope on defence. 68 min: Chile make a change. Huenteo comes on for Urrutia. 66 min: Endler again! Press looks to have scored a close-range header but the Chilean keeper flies across goal to claw the ball away. The US are winning comfortably but there\u2019s a good argument a Chilean has been player of the match. 62 min: Krieger tracks back to mop up a Chile attack - she has worked hard today. McDonald teases her marker down the left and then cuts in for a shot on the goal. Her curling shot has Endler beaten but the shot finds the post rather than the net. McDonald has been very good since coming on. 59 min: The US are not going for another 13-0 by the look of things. But then again, Chile aren\u2019t letting them - particularly the excellent Endler. Press tries a volley from a sharp angle and the Chilean keeper palms it out for a corner. Long comes on for Horan. 56 min: Horan picks up a header from Horan and tries a shot from 35 yards out. It is not a good shot if you value shots being on target. She has another chance seconds later with Press squaring it to her around 10 yards out. Horan\u2019s shot this time is a better but Endler saves well. 53 min: Chile attack patiently before a loose pass loses them possession. The US mount their own attack but McDonald\u2019s long throw is cleared. Chile have been better this half so far. 50 min: McDonald is distributing the ball nicely for her teammates. This time she lays it off for Pugh, whose shot is deflected for a corner. Chile get it clear. 48 min: Chile continue to pass it out from the back - they\u2019re determined not to go to the long ball. But they play very tight at the back and that makes it hard to clear their lines. McDonald releases Pugh, who passes to Press and Endler pulls off a good save at the near post. It was offside anyway. 46 min: Halftime subs: Lopez comes on for Soto for Chile. McDonald replaces Ertz for the US. So, if the US go on to win this match - and I think they may just manage that - they will play Sweden. The US now have a huge advantage in goal difference +16 to +6, so a draw or win would send the US through as group winners. And put them on course for a potential clash with hosts France in the quarter-finals. Jon Tupper thinks there will only be one winner in that match: \u201cFrance\u2019s speed on the wings, and strength up the middle with Renard and Henry, has a huge possibility for sending the Americans a huge loss,\u201d he writes. You can see the latest standings here. Half-time thoughts: 1) The US have shown that even their second-string attack is capable of taking lesser teams apart. That depth if they do make it into the late stages of the tournament. 2) Don\u2019t make Carli Lloyd angry - or do make her angry if you want her to score a few. 3) Chile are tough defenders and Endler is a commanding keeper but this is not the World Cup in which they break through to the upper levels of the game 4) We still don\u2019t know if the US defence is capable of holding up against world-class attackers. In Chile\u2019s first real attack, they had the ball in the back of the net. The US can say they sprung an offside trap but it looked a little to me like some players lost their markers. Good news for Chile: they should only be two down as the US scored off a corner that should have been a free-kick. Bad news for Chile, they are 3-0 down. Worse news for Chile: the US were only 3-0 up at half-time against Thailand and then scored ten in the second half. 43 min: Saez takes a big hack at a US ankle and the Americans have a free-kick just outside the area on the right. Davidson takes it too quickly and has to retake. This time the ball comes out to Pugh who sends it high into the Paris sky. 40 min: Endler positions her defenders as the US line-up a free-kick around 25 yards out. Lloyd goes up for the header - again - but she uses her hand and it\u2019s Chile\u2019s ball. 37 min: Zamora\u2019s cross is gathered by Naeher and her long throw releases Press for a scamper down the wing. Chile clear. The excellent Press twists and turns on the edge of the area. Her shot is deflected out for a corner (an actual corner this time). Davidson sends in another good delivery and Lloyd thumps a header home. No saving that one. I think she may be fired up. 32 min: Yep, another look at the second US goal and it was NOT a corner. Chile are right to be angry at conceding from the (non) corner. They do have a corner of their own now though - their first of the game. Naeher comes out to claim the cross cleanly. 29 min: Ertz thrusts out an arm and catches - accidentally - her marker in the face. Chile win a free-kick around the halfway line but it comes to nothing. I still haven\u2019t seen a replay of the corner that led to the second goal so I\u2019m not sure if Chile are right to claim it should have been a goal kick. A quiet period for the US ends with a corner although Chile argue with the ref, saying it should be a goal-kick. Oh, and they\u2019ll be angry now. Ertz powers a header past Endler. The keeper gets a hand to it but it\u2019s too strong and she can only palm it into the corner. It was an excellent corner \u2013 the whip on it helped Ertz generate that power. 25 min: Peter Oh writes in with some stats. \u201cUnited States population: 327 million.Chile population: 18 million (about 5.5% of the U.S.) So if the stadium is \u201c90%\u201d for the U.S. and the rest for the South Americans, I\u2019d say La Roja are rather well supported\u201d Ah, but I didn\u2019t say the other 10% were Chilean. They\u2019re all Tuvaluan. 23 min: Chile get their first attack of the day and the ball ends up in the net. Chile play in the free-kick and Guerrero finds herself completely unmarked in the area. She slots it past Naeher and into the empty net. But the offside flag goes up. The US may claim they played the offside trap there but it shows they can be vulnerable at the back. 20 min: That goal was Lloyd\u2019s 112th at international level. It lifts her above someone called Marta. Not too bad company (she\u2019s 72 behind her former teammate Abby Wambach, mind). Lara is OK to continue and we resume. 18 min: Press has been causing plenty of problems for Chile on the left. A cross comes in and Ertz and Lloyd both go up for the header. It is Ertz who gets her head to it, and it is deflected for a corner. Chile\u2019s Lara is down in the area, and her teammates are calling for the trainer. 16 min: The US win a corner on the right for the first time. Chile scramble a Lloyd header clear before Lara hacks down Brian on the edge of the area. That leads to another corner which Chile handle. 13 min: Lloyd, at 36, is the oldest World Cup goalscorer in US history. You wouldn\u2019t bet against her trying to come back to score at 40 in 2023. What a player, what a ruthless competitor. Chile are, to be fair, not resorting to the long ball and are pinging some nice short passes. The problem is that they are finding it very tough to get our of their own half. Oh, and what a goal! A loose ball comes out to Lloyd on the edge of the area and she slams it home from 20 yards. 9 min: The US are faster, stronger, craftier and more incisive than Chile so far. Apart from that, it\u2019s pretty even. A corner for the US and Press sends it into the near post but Chile clear. 7 min: A lot of early pressure for the US. If it continues like this, things could get ugly for Chile. The US are getting lots of space on the wings, and the match could easily be 2-0 already. 5 min: Seeing as the US defenders didn\u2019t get to touch the ball that much against the Thailand, they elect to knock it about a bit at the back. Then they storm forward. Endler keeps out a near own-goal and Lloyd looks set to knock in the loose ball before the keeper smothers the ball. 3 min: The crowd appears to be 90% American, giving this a hint of a home game for the US. And the defending champions get an early corner. Endler punches straight to Brian, who has a great opportunity but she blazes the shot over the bar. Should have done better. 1 min: And we\u2019re off! The USA are in white and their opponents in red and blue. Chile do not concede in the first 12 seconds. \u201cUSA will win by 6-0 what can I win for my prediction,\u201d writes Sandy Blessing. You win a starting spot against Sweden. Better start warming up... The Chile anthem is very long. So long that it goes on longer than the Fifa allotted time for anthems. So they just cut it off midway through. Odd because Fifa is pretty comfortable with excess when its their own excess. The teams are walking out in Paris in front of what looks like a packed stadium (perhaps not that surprising given that 14% of US college freshmen decamp to Paris in the summer vacation). Carli Lloyd is back in the starting XI today, as captain. Although she\u2019s mainly a bench player these days at the age of 36, she is not happy about being a sub. It wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if she took out some of that anger on Chile today - via the medium of goals rather than fisticuffs. Our own Caitlin Murray \u2013 who bumped into Sam Mewis and her parents at the Eiffel Tower last week \u2013 is at the stadium and has been chatting to fans: I\u2019m here at Parc des Princes and it\u2019s definitely safe to say that the American contingent is dwarfing the Chilean one. But I\u2019ve seen a few Chile shirts walking around the stadium here, which is more than I saw from Thailand in Reims \u2014 perhaps that has something to do with Chile making their debut. I actually met a couple from Chile in the lobby of my hotel this morning, and the man said \u201cSo what do you think? US, 5-0?\u201d I said \u201cEh, 4-0\u201d and we laughed. Even though Jill Ellis has named a mostly second-choice starting 11, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt who the favorite is. No matter what side the fans are rooting for, it\u2019s a beautiful day in Paris for some soccer/football \u2014 sunny and only slightly hot, and there\u2019s a buzz in the air. For my part, I\u2019m saying 4-1 to the US today. It\u2019s Father\u2019s Day in the US, so we have a short clip of US players confirming they have fathers (a biological necessity) and love them too (not a necessity but welcome). Which is nice. Defens(c)e is seen as the US\u2019s biggest weakness but, as you may have noticed, they were not tested against Thailand. That may change against Chile, who have goalscoring midfielder Karen Araya at their disposal. She could cause the US a few problems if she\u2019s allowed space today. How well the US handle her, could give a few clues about how they fare against the stronger teams in the knockout stage. Tobin Heath has popped up on the ads on Fox selling an tyre company I cannot name for journalistic ethics reasons. She says her youth coaches are the best coaches she has ever worked with. Somewhere, a tear rolls down Jill Ellis\u2019s cheek. An email: \u201cI first got to know Alex Morgan via playing with her in the Fifa \u201819 Story mode,\u201d writes StickSports Fan [possibly not their legal name]. \u201cWhile it seems so based on the highlights I\u2019ve seen as research on YouTube, I want it confirmed - is Ms Morgan as good a football player in real life as she is playing alongside my character on Easy? Also, what\u2019s USA\u2019s preferred formation on the field?\u201d I imagine that depends on how good you are at Fifa. But I think against Thailand, that was pretty much Easy mode so you have an accurate picture. Morgan will be on the bench today though, although I imagine she will trot on for the last 15 mins or so if things are going well. The US played the rare 0-0-10 formation against Thailand, but it looks like they\u2019ll play 4-3-3 today. Having said that, I only got to page five of Inverting the Pyramid so I may be wrong. Sweden booked their place in the knockout stages with a victory over Thailand earlier today (they only managed five goals!) and the US will join them if they beat Chile. That should be a formality, even with a weakened team, but Chile are unlikely to give up 13 goals. That\u2019s because they have one of the best goalkeepers in the world in PSG\u2019s Christiane Endler. She\u2019s also a great penalty stopper, should any US players find themselves hacked down in the area today. You can read more on the Chile team in our guide here: Those of you expecting another double-digit thrashing may be disappointed today. Jill Ellis has named a weakened US team for their meeting with Chile. Many of the team\u2019s stars \u2013 including Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe and Crystal Dunn \u2013 are on the bench. Having said that, Ellis has done this kind of thing before in qualifying and, seeing as Chile are ranked below Thailand in the Fifa rankings, the US should win this one easily anyway. Also, when you can bring on a former world player of the year off the bench, you\u2019re probably doing OK. USA: Naeher, Krieger, Dahlkemper, Sauerbrunn, Davidson, Brian, Ertz, Horan, Press, Lloyd, Pugh. Subs: Harris, Mewis, O\u2019Hara, Morgan, Sonnett, Rapinoe, Lavelle, Heath, Dunn, Long, McDonald, Franch. Chile: Endler, Galaz, Guerrero, Saez, Toro, Claudia Soto, Araya, Lara, Zamora, Urrutia, Balmaceda. Subs: Campos, Rocio Soto, Diaz, Rojas, Aedo, Lopez, Grez, Pardo, Pinilla, Huenteo, Duran, Torrero. Referee: Hussein Riem (Germany) Tom will be here shortly, in the meantime Hope Solo gave her thoughts on the US\u2019s record win over Thailand in their opener: Should the US have taken their foot off the pedal against Thailand?

Police have advised residents in around 590 properties in Wainfleet and neighbouring areas to evacuate amid concerns about flood defences along the river Steeping. Parts of the market town near Skegness flooded on Wednesday after more than two months\u2019 worth of rain fell in two days. Three RAF helicopters dropped 270 one-tonne sandbags to repair the bank of the river. After evacuating 290 homes, police on Saturday published a further list of postcodes that needed to be to vacated, amounting to another 300 properties. They said the move was a \u201cprecautionary action\u201d and recommended that people stay in emergency accommodation or with family and friends. \u201cThose leaving their property need to turn off their electric if safe to do so and take medicine, pets, phone chargers, and essential items with them,\u201d read a statement by police.

      "bodyText": "The Coalition\u2019s plan to flatten tax brackets for middle to high income earners will provide twice as much benefit to men than women, a new analysis has found. The analysis by the Australia Institute, released on Monday, found that in 2024-25, the first year of the controversial third stage of the government\u2019s tax plan, men will pocket $11bn in income tax cuts while women receive just $6bn. Income tax cuts are the first order of business when parliament resumes in the first week of July but the Coalition and Labor are locked in a high stakes game of chicken, with both warning cuts for low and middle income earners should not be delayed by political posturing over the final stage. The Morrison government\u2019s income tax package is divided into three parts: the first stage provides a tax offset to benefit low and middle income earners from 2019 to 2022; the second stage raises the 19% tax bracket threshold from $41,000 to $45,000 from 2022; and the third stage flattens tax brackets from 2024 so everyone earning between $45,000 to $200,000 would pay a marginal rate of 30%. While Labor has agreed to the first stage and is open to the second, it has thus far balked at stage three, demanding to know how much of the tax cuts will flow to high-income earners in a bid to pressure the government to split the bill. Crossbench demands for a new coal power station or gas reservation have been rebuffed by the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, who has refused to horse trade or split the bill, pressuring Labor to pass the cuts in full. The Australia Institute found that, because the tax cuts in the third stage flow mainly to high-income earners, men get most of the benefit because males are more likely than females to earn higher incomes. The distributional analysis by senior economist Matt Grudnoff found the top 10% of income earners will get 31% of the tax cut in stage three, of which 23% goes to males and 8% goes to females. The benefits of the first stage of the tax plan are \u201calmost equal\u201d, with 47% going to women and 53% to men, it said. \u201cWhen stage two begins in 2022-23 the female share falls \u2026 to 43%. When stage three begins the female share falls to 36%.\u201d Grudnoff said \u201cthe final stages of these tax cuts will further entrench gender inequality\u201d. \u201cWith the slowing economy, the government needs to be clever with its fiscal stimulus,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tax cuts to high-income earners in 2024-25 are not well targeted and are too far off to help the economy right now.\u201d On Friday the shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, wrote to the government asking the total cost of tax cuts and how much would flow to people earning $180,000 or more. Chalmers cited estimates by the Australia Institute that high-income earners would receive $77bn of the benefit, while the Grattan Institute has put the figure at $89bn and the ANU\u2019s Centre for Social Research and Methods had suggested $88bn. \u201cAs you know, Labor stands ready to urgently pass the first tranche of tax cuts to address the weakness in the economy on your watch,\u201d he said. \u201cWe require this additional information to properly consider the latter stages before making final decisions.\u201d",

But when you add the act of pinching to that list it seems largely peculiar and out of place. It\u2019s something you\u2019d expect to see at a high-school level and it begs the question: why would a professional footballer resort to pinching?

      "body": "<p>As she sat on the train to the Hay festival late last month, the London-based Turkish novelist Elif Shafak received a chilling telephone call from her editor in Istanbul. She was told that police officers had entered the publishing house and taken copies of her books to a prosecutor, who planned to scour them for evidence of her having committed a \u201ccrime of obscenity\u201d by writing about, for example, sexual harassment or child abuse. At the same time, the writer witnessed an avalanche of abusive and misogynist messages directed at her on social media \u2013 digital intimidation to accompany harassment by the authorities.</p> <p>The targeting of novelists in this way marks a new nadir in the Turkish government\u2019s persecution of journalists, intellectuals, writers and academics. As Shafak has pointed out, the supreme irony is that real-life violence against women and girls is a desperately serious problem in Turkey. <a href=\"http://evaw-global-database.unwomen.org/en/countries/asia/turkey\" title=\"\">According to United Nations figures</a>, 38% of Turkish women experience physical or sexual violence from a partner. Women murdered by a partner or a family member numbered 409 in 2017, up from 237 four years previously, <a href=\"http://www.kadincinayetlerinidurduracagiz.net/for-english\">according to</a> the group We Will Stop Femicide. Self-evidently, the authorities ought to be investigating real violence against women and girls, not novelists legitimately pursuing their art. But there seems little hope of this. In 2016 the government <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-38030182\" title=\"\">introduced a bill</a> clearing statutory rapists of their crime if they married their victims. Back in 2014 Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-30183711\" title=\"\">declared</a>: \u201cYou cannot put women and men on an equal footing. It is against nature.\u201d He has also called childless women \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/06/turkish-president-erdogan-childless-women-deficient-incomplete\" title=\"\">deficient, incomplete</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Long before the attempted military coup against Mr Erdo\u011fan\u2019s government in July 2016, press and artistic freedom was seriously under threat in Turkey. Anti-defamation and anti-terrorism laws had been used aggressively to target journalists and writers. Shafak herself was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/02/elif-shafak-turkish-novelist-calls-for-support-writers-face-crackdown\" title=\"\">tried and acquitted in 2006</a> of \u201cinsulting Turkishness\u201d because one of the characters in her novel The Bastard of Istanbul referred to the massacre of Armenians in the first world war as genocide.</p> <p>After the coup attempt, Mr Erdo\u011fan, to quote Turkish journalist <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/the-prospect-podcast-72-turkey-and-the-rise-of-the-right\" title=\"\">Ece Temelkuran</a>, \u201cturned a crisis into an opportunity\u201d, and transformed this pressure into a full-scale purge. In the months afterwards, 150 media outlets were forcibly closed. In May, Amnesty described Turkey as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/05/turkey-the-worlds-largest-prison-for-journalists/\" title=\"\">the world\u2019s largest prison for journalists</a>\u201d. The targeting of Shafak\u2019s novels is just another twist in this tale of paranoia and repression.</p> <p>On 23 June, local elections in Istanbul will be rerun after <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-48190346\">Mr Erdo\u011fan\u2019s ruling AK party cried foul</a> when March\u2019s original ballot narrowly returned an opposition politician as mayor. At this moment in particular the international community must stand in solidarity with those Turks who, despite everything, still hope that the lineaments of their country\u2019s civil society have not been permanently damaged.</p>",

      "bodyText": "As she sat on the train to the Hay festival late last month, the London-based Turkish novelist Elif Shafak received a chilling telephone call from her editor in Istanbul. She was told that police officers had entered the publishing house and taken copies of her books to a prosecutor, who planned to scour them for evidence of her having committed a \u201ccrime of obscenity\u201d by writing about, for example, sexual harassment or child abuse. At the same time, the writer witnessed an avalanche of abusive and misogynist messages directed at her on social media \u2013 digital intimidation to accompany harassment by the authorities. The targeting of novelists in this way marks a new nadir in the Turkish government\u2019s persecution of journalists, intellectuals, writers and academics. As Shafak has pointed out, the supreme irony is that real-life violence against women and girls is a desperately serious problem in Turkey. According to United Nations figures, 38% of Turkish women experience physical or sexual violence from a partner. Women murdered by a partner or a family member numbered 409 in 2017, up from 237 four years previously, according to the group We Will Stop Femicide. Self-evidently, the authorities ought to be investigating real violence against women and girls, not novelists legitimately pursuing their art. But there seems little hope of this. In 2016 the government introduced a bill clearing statutory rapists of their crime if they married their victims. Back in 2014 Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, declared: \u201cYou cannot put women and men on an equal footing. It is against nature.\u201d He has also called childless women \u201cdeficient, incomplete\u201d. Long before the attempted military coup against Mr Erdo\u011fan\u2019s government in July 2016, press and artistic freedom was seriously under threat in Turkey. Anti-defamation and anti-terrorism laws had been used aggressively to target journalists and writers. Shafak herself was tried and acquitted in 2006 of \u201cinsulting Turkishness\u201d because one of the characters in her novel The Bastard of Istanbul referred to the massacre of Armenians in the first world war as genocide. After the coup attempt, Mr Erdo\u011fan, to quote Turkish journalist Ece Temelkuran, \u201cturned a crisis into an opportunity\u201d, and transformed this pressure into a full-scale purge. In the months afterwards, 150 media outlets were forcibly closed. In May, Amnesty described Turkey as \u201cthe world\u2019s largest prison for journalists\u201d. The targeting of Shafak\u2019s novels is just another twist in this tale of paranoia and repression. On 23 June, local elections in Istanbul will be rerun after Mr Erdo\u011fan\u2019s ruling AK party cried foul when March\u2019s original ballot narrowly returned an opposition politician as mayor. At this moment in particular the international community must stand in solidarity with those Turks who, despite everything, still hope that the lineaments of their country\u2019s civil society have not been permanently damaged.",

An inquiry, sparked by parents\u2019 serious concerns, found that the needs of highly troubled under-18s in the county were neglected as a result of significant failings in care provision by the two NHS-funded providers in the area. The inquiry team\u2019s unpublished 37-page report \u2013 seen by the Guardian \u2013 outlines how vulnerable young autistic people with problems including anxiety faced long delays in receiving specialist help and were repeatedly passed between different services. The two care providers argued over which of them was responsible for the child\u2019s care, as one focused on autism and the other on mental health issues. NHS clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) in Staffordshire commissioned the Northumberland Tyne and Wear (NTW) NHS mental health trust to review services for young people with autism in its area. It was triggered by longstanding criticism of two providers, Midlands Psychology (MP), which had a focus on autism, and Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (MPFT), from families. The inquiry found that health professionals dealing with the young people did not carry out proper risk assessments, and did not record risky behaviour by them that showed they were in danger of harming themselves, even though under-18s with autism are at higher risk of trying to take their own life. It also found that autistic youngsters who were experiencing a mental health crisis received poor support, despite that also raising their risk of self-harm or suicide. The NTW experts concluded that: \u201cWe as a team did not feel that the current approach to risk assessment and management to be robust, co-ordinated or safe.\u201d They were so worried by what they found that as soon as their inspection ended last July, they wrote to the NHS bodies that brought them in urging them to order the two providers to take \u201cimmediate action\u201d to tackle five areas of inadequate practice that, in their view, posed a risk of harm to young people, without waiting for its formal report to arrive.

He described Skripal, a former colonel in Russian military intelligence who betrayed dozens of Russian agents to MI6, as London\u2019s spy.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s your agent not ours. That means you spied against us and it\u2019s hard for me to say what happened with him subsequently. We need to forget about all this in the final analysis,\u201d said. According to Putin, \u201cglobal issues related to common economic, social and security interests are more important than the games played by intelligence agencies\u201d, he said.</p> <p>The Russian president also mentioned his recent meeting with members of the British community, describing it as \u201cvery good\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe have $22bn-worth of British investment. These people want to feel secure. They would a positive trend in relations to emerge. We treat them as friends, whose interests must be protected regardless of the current political situation,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Christian Turner, Britain\u2019s deputy national security adviser, went to Moscow this month to meet Russian ministers and officials.

It is thought to be unrealistic to expect Russia to accept responsibility for the Skripal episode, or allow the two GRU agents to be extradited for trial in the UK. The Foreign Office, and intelligence agencies, would have to judge whether some kind of acknowledgement that such episodes should not happen, or ever be repeated, the maximum likely to be offered, is sufficient for relations to be taken out of the deep freeze. Britain would need certainty that Russia had drawn the right conclusions from the episode. Britain remains certain that the Russian state was responsible for the poisoning based on the information provided by Porton Down, the government\u2019s chemical weapons research centre. Two named Russian agents were identified by the UK government inquiry as travelling to Salisbury at the time of the poisoning, and the pair then attempted on TV to explain their visit simply as driven as tourists\u2019 interest in the cathedral city. The inept explanation was seen as laughable inside Russia, and was thought to have embarrassed Putin. May said the operation has been conducted by GRU intelligence agents and would almost certainly have been approved outside the GRU at a senior level of the Russian state. Nevertheless, the UK side has been intrigued by recent public comments from Putin distancing the Russian political class from the actions of the spy agency. \u201cWhen all\u2019s said and done we need to turn this page connected with spies and assassination attempts,\u201d Putin said recently on the sidelines of an economic forum in St Petersburg. He described Skripal, a former colonel in Russian military intelligence who betrayed dozens of Russian agents to MI6, as London\u2019s spy. \u201cHe\u2019s your agent not ours. That means you spied against us and it\u2019s hard for me to say what happened with him subsequently. We need to forget about all this in the final analysis,\u201d said. According to Putin, \u201cglobal issues related to common economic, social and security interests are more important than the games played by intelligence agencies\u201d, he said. The Russian president also mentioned his recent meeting with members of the British community, describing it as \u201cvery good\u201d. \u201cWe have $22bn-worth of British investment. These people want to feel secure. They would a positive trend in relations to emerge. We treat them as friends, whose interests must be protected regardless of the current political situation,\u201d he said. Christian Turner, Britain\u2019s deputy national security adviser, went to Moscow this month to meet Russian ministers and officials. A level of co-operation is needed between countries intelligence agencies so that signals, such as troop movements, are not misread.",

      "bodyText": "Theresa May is deceiving us, either deliberately or through ignorance, with regard to the goal of reducing carbon emissions to zero by 2050 (May puts 2050 zero emission target into law, 12 June). This is impossible for any economy based on mass consumption. Over decades, most British manufacturing has shifted abroad, in particular to Asia where labour is cheap. These items are usually produced with high carbon outputs, with electricity supplied through coal. For an accurate figure of Britain\u2019s emissions, our consumption of goods produced overseas must be included. As Britain\u2019s consumption has increased enormously over the past 30 years, this carbon addition will be substantial. It is a nonsense for rich countries, with increasing consumption that is excluded from carbon calculations, to pretend they are cutting carbon emissions. A British child during their lifetime may produce at least 200 times more carbon than a poor African child. And it is the poor child who will suffer first from climate change. For a successful response to climate change, reality must take precedence over public relations. Nature cannot be cheated. Michael Stone Moretonhampstead, Devon \u2022 Now that the government is claiming bragging rights on carbon emissions, would this be a good time to reprint in a prominent position the report, hidden in last Monday\u2019s business section, which reveals that the UK gives \u00a32.5bn per year to developing countries in support of fossil fuel projects (Government criticised for funding fossil fuel-burning plants abroad, 10 June)? Celia Forsyth Kendal, Cumbria \u2022 We welcome plans announced to cut the UK\u2019s emissions. To achieve the target, the Committee on Climate Change estimates we will need a 10% shift away from travel in cars towards walking, cycling and public transport. That means thinking radically about how we design our towns and cities, the requirements on developers and how we target infrastructure investment towards schemes that prioritise active travel. But we can\u2019t afford to wait. Our charter for walking neighbourhoods sets out steps to encourage walking, such as making cities greener, implementing default 20mph speed limits and involving communities in the design and maintenance of public spaces. The benefits reach beyond mitigating climate change: neighbourhoods that are green and walkable inspire people to be more active, promoting physical and mental health, improving air quality and creating places where people want to live and work. Gemma Cantelo Head of policy and advocacy, The Ramblers \u2022 On consecutive days last week we heard political commitments about the crisis caused by climate change and the impact of the UK\u2019s progress on the sustainable development goals (SDGs).

      "body": "<p>A mere six minutes of screen-time in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/jul/26/guardianobituaries.filmnews\" title=\"\">John Schlesinger</a>\u2019s 1969 counter-cultural hit Midnight Cowboy was all it took to land Sylvia Miles her first Oscar nomination. For the 1975 adaptation of Raymond Chandler\u2019s Farewell, My Lovely, which brought her second Oscar nod, she still failed to clock up more than 10 minutes on screen. But then Miles, who has died aged 94, knew how to make every second count, filling her life as well as her performances with incident and vitality.</p> <p>Midnight Cowboy demonstrated her extraordinary way with character, conveying the depth of a complex life in a handful of concentrated gestures. Briskly applying her lipstick in the mirror, she is oblivious to the awkward attempts by the greenhorn hustler Joe (Jon Voight) to broach the subject of payment after sex.</p> <p>When the penny drops, it is with the force of an H-bomb. \u201cYou were gonna ask me for money?\u201d she croaks. \u201cWho the hell do you think you\u2019re dealing with? Some old slut on 42nd Street?\u201d She declares herself \u201cone hell of a gorgeous chick\u201d before diving, sobbing, in the direction of the nearest box of tissues.</p> <p>\u201cI become the character at the time I\u2019m doing it, so it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s two minutes or 200 hours,\u201d Miles later explained. Bob Dylan had been commissioned to write the film\u2019s theme song but failed to deliver it in time; nevertheless it was always Miles\u2019s contention that the eventual result, Lay Lady Lay, was inspired by her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbb1ee6e448cb0cde9fa7974c6b508862de47968\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbb1ee6e448cb0cde9fa7974c6b508862de47968/0_67_2496_1497/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sylvia Miles and Robert Mitchum in Farewell, My Lovely, 1975.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sylvia Miles and Robert Mitchum in Farewell, My Lovely, 1975.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Embassy Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She was no less memorable in Farewell, My Lovely as a boozy ex-showgirl briefly revived by the knowledge of her own usefulness, however fleeting, to the private detective Philip Marlowe (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/nov/03/biography.highereducation1\" title=\"\">Robert Mitchum</a>). In between those two films she had the rare chance to play a lead, and responded with some of her fiercest work: Heat (1972), produced by Andy Warhol and directed by Paul Morrissey, was a loose update of Sunset Boulevard in which she took the Gloria Swanson role of the faded star.</p> <p>Dazed non-professionals were Warhol and Morrissey\u2019s preferred collaborators and the presence for the first time in one of their movies of a skilled and vivid performer with her own baggage gave the film an extra kick.</p> <p>Miles brought the same degree of commitment to everything that came her way, be it a part or a party, and the suggestion that she might not be welcome at the latest shindig was far likelier to provoke her ire than a mere bad notice.</p> <p>After the critic John Simon referred to her in print in 1973 as \u201cone of New York\u2019s leading party girls and gate-crashers\u201d, she dumped her dinner on his head in a restaurant. Most reports claimed it was a plate of pat\u00e9, steak tartare, brie and potato salad; Miles added coleslaw and cold cuts in her own re-telling, which ended with her advising Simon: \u201cNow you can call me a plate-crasher, too!\u201d Decades later she was still smarting from the slight. \u201cHow could I crash anything? I was invited to everything!\u201d</p> <p>She was born in New York to Bella (nee Feldman) and her husband Reuben Scheinwald, a furniture-maker and factory owner . As a child she played chess with her father in Washington Square Park, and continued to do so competitively.</p> <p>She was educated at Washington Irving high school and Pratt Institute, and also attended the Actors Studio. She appeared in countless off-Broadway shows in her career, beginning in 1954 with A Stone for Danny Fisher, starring Zero Mostel.</p> <p>In 1957, a year into its run, she joined the cast of The Iceman Cometh, starring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/dec/28/guardianobituaries.filmnews\" title=\"\">Jason Robards</a>, in the production generally credited with fortifying that play\u2019s reputation.

      "bodyText": "A mere six minutes of screen-time in John Schlesinger\u2019s 1969 counter-cultural hit Midnight Cowboy was all it took to land Sylvia Miles her first Oscar nomination. For the 1975 adaptation of Raymond Chandler\u2019s Farewell, My Lovely, which brought her second Oscar nod, she still failed to clock up more than 10 minutes on screen. But then Miles, who has died aged 94, knew how to make every second count, filling her life as well as her performances with incident and vitality. Midnight Cowboy demonstrated her extraordinary way with character, conveying the depth of a complex life in a handful of concentrated gestures. Briskly applying her lipstick in the mirror, she is oblivious to the awkward attempts by the greenhorn hustler Joe (Jon Voight) to broach the subject of payment after sex. When the penny drops, it is with the force of an H-bomb. \u201cYou were gonna ask me for money?\u201d she croaks. \u201cWho the hell do you think you\u2019re dealing with? Some old slut on 42nd Street?\u201d She declares herself \u201cone hell of a gorgeous chick\u201d before diving, sobbing, in the direction of the nearest box of tissues. \u201cI become the character at the time I\u2019m doing it, so it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s two minutes or 200 hours,\u201d Miles later explained. Bob Dylan had been commissioned to write the film\u2019s theme song but failed to deliver it in time; nevertheless it was always Miles\u2019s contention that the eventual result, Lay Lady Lay, was inspired by her. She was no less memorable in Farewell, My Lovely as a boozy ex-showgirl briefly revived by the knowledge of her own usefulness, however fleeting, to the private detective Philip Marlowe (Robert Mitchum). In between those two films she had the rare chance to play a lead, and responded with some of her fiercest work: Heat (1972), produced by Andy Warhol and directed by Paul Morrissey, was a loose update of Sunset Boulevard in which she took the Gloria Swanson role of the faded star. Dazed non-professionals were Warhol and Morrissey\u2019s preferred collaborators and the presence for the first time in one of their movies of a skilled and vivid performer with her own baggage gave the film an extra kick. Miles brought the same degree of commitment to everything that came her way, be it a part or a party, and the suggestion that she might not be welcome at the latest shindig was far likelier to provoke her ire than a mere bad notice. After the critic John Simon referred to her in print in 1973 as \u201cone of New York\u2019s leading party girls and gate-crashers\u201d, she dumped her dinner on his head in a restaurant. Most reports claimed it was a plate of pat\u00e9, steak tartare, brie and potato salad; Miles added coleslaw and cold cuts in her own re-telling, which ended with her advising Simon: \u201cNow you can call me a plate-crasher, too!\u201d Decades later she was still smarting from the slight. \u201cHow could I crash anything? I was invited to everything!\u201d She was born in New York to Bella (nee Feldman) and her husband Reuben Scheinwald, a furniture-maker and factory owner . As a child she played chess with her father in Washington Square Park, and continued to do so competitively. She was educated at Washington Irving high school and Pratt Institute, and also attended the Actors Studio. She appeared in countless off-Broadway shows in her career, beginning in 1954 with A Stone for Danny Fisher, starring Zero Mostel. In 1957, a year into its run, she joined the cast of The Iceman Cometh, starring Jason Robards, in the production generally credited with fortifying that play\u2019s reputation. She was also in the US premiere of Jean Genet\u2019s The Balcony in 1960, for which her dresser was said to be Barbra Streisand. In 1981 she mounted a poorly received one-woman show, It\u2019s Me, Sylvia!, derived from articles she had written for the SoHo Weekly News and performed on a set modelled on her own notoriously cluttered apartment. Her career in the 1960s was dominated by theatre and television before Midnight Cowboy led film-makers to notice her. She was briefly seen in Dennis Hopper\u2019s The Last Movie (1971) and starred with Peter Fonda in the thriller 92 in the Shade (1975). In Michael Winner\u2019s tasteless horror The Sentinel (1977), she was a German zombie lesbian ballet dancer. She remained in that genre to play a fortune teller in The Funhouse (1981), then starred as James Mason\u2019s wife in the Agatha Christie adaptation Evil Under the Sun (1982). In Wall Street (1987), she was a brassy real estate agent, decked out in leopard print with sunglasses wedged in her platinum hair; she returned briefly in the 2010 sequel Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps. Her boisterous turn as the chicken-chomping, lip-smacking matchmaker in Crossing Delancey (1988) was among her funniest work. She was reunited with Morrissey on Spike of Bensonhurst (1988), in which he cast her as a coke-snorting politician. In Abel Ferrara\u2019s Go Go Tales (2007), starring Willem Dafoe and Bob Hoskins, she was a landlady who considers turning a pole-dancing club into a branch of Bed Bath and Beyond. \u201cI\u2019m always thought of as controversial or avant garde or erotic or salacious,\u201d she once reflected. \u201cBut there isn\u2019t anybody I know who wouldn\u2019t live my life if they could.\u201d Her days were spent \u201cgoing out, working, getting laid,\u201d and she flitted from one companion to the next with aplomb and enthusiasm.

      "bodyText": "France has seen a huge surge in enthusiasm for women\u2019s football, with TV viewing figures for the World Cup double what was predicted, national-team games packing stadiums, France shirts selling fast and players swiftly becoming household names. As France prepare to face Nigeria on Monday in Rennes, sponsors and TV commentators have revelled in the increased interest. More than 10 million French TV viewers have tuned in for each of France\u2019s matches. The top TV channel TF1, the main broadcaster of the tournament, had expected up to five million viewers for the first match. It got around double. Significantly, twice as many viewers watched France\u2019s 4-0 win against South Korea in the tournament\u2019s opening match than tuned in for the men\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifier against Andorra the night before. According to Mediam\u00e9trie analysts, 54% of French TV viewers of Les Bleues\u2019 fixtures are men under 50. Many of them are praising the \u201csuperior quality\u201d of the game. A large amount of families are watching on TV, as well as going to watch the teams in stadiums, where young boys can be seen in the special kits being sold in support of the women\u2019s team. Players such as the France captain, Amandine Henry, the star striker Eug\u00e9nie Le Sommer and the defender Wendie Renard have become household names and the team are regularly on the front pages \u2013 an increased visibility that has led commentators to predict an increased interest from sponsors. The crowds turning up to France\u2019s training sessions have swelled, with children calling out to players by their first names for autographs. The France manager, Corinne Diacre, has also swiftly become a household name for using dead-pan humour in response to being portrayed by media as overly strict and severe. The number of hotel bookings in towns hosting matches is said by tourism groups to be unexpectedly high, although for most matches not involving France the stadiums have been far from full. Bars screening the matches report a good turnout. \u201cThere have been a steady number of people watching it live,\u201d said a staff member at Au Metro, a Paris bar known for screening sport. France\u2019s second match, a 2-1 win against Norway in Nice, played to a packed stadium, despite women\u2019s football in the city previously seeing much smaller audiences in recent months. \u201cYou can feel this surge of momentum behind the sport \u2013 the TV viewing figures are staggering,\u201d said Virginie Bachelier, a sports correspondent for Ouest France, France\u2019s biggest-selling regional paper, which is devoting a large amount of coverage to the event. \u201cSix months ago, if a women\u2019s football match got one million TV viewers, that would be considered good.

In 2015, Peter gave us his papers, production files, manuscripts, books, records, tapes, pottery, posters, photographs, sculpture and props so that we could curate an archive in his name for the Cinema and Television History Research Institute at De Montfort University, Leicester. It documents both his work and his life because he made little distinction between them. Creativity flowed through everything he did, unrestricted by boundaries of genre or medium. That creativity flows through the stories, which the archive also reveals, of the talented women with whom Peter was romantically involved and collaborated artistically.",

Murray, who turned 32 last month, said on Sunday there was a moment recently that rekindled his love of the game he has played since he was young and how he was reminded he might never again reach the level that delivered him three slam titles and two Olympic gold medals. \u201cI hit some balls with some kids a few weeks ago,\u201d he said. \u201cI was practising on the court next to them. Seeing young kids running around and hitting tennis balls, just loving practising and playing, it makes you remember that is how you started \u2013 and the reason why you do it is because it is fun and you love it and it becomes a passion. \u201cYes, everyone wants to do well in their job but, ultimately, all you can do is do your best \u2013 and my best now might not be what it was when I was 25, in terms of what that looks like on a court. Who knows? Maybe it will be in a few months. Right now it certainly isn\u2019t, so I can\u2019t be expecting to put in that kind of performance.\u201d Murray admitted: \u201cThere were a number of times over the last 18 months that I did want to stop. I didn\u2019t want to play any more. I was getting no enjoyment out of tennis at all, whether that be training, practice, winning matches. I wasn\u2019t really bothered because it wasn\u2019t fun. Now it is nice. I just like playing.\u201d L\u00f3pez, who won the 2016 French Open doubles title with Marc L\u00f3pez and was the singles champion here two years ago, said: \u201cAs soon as you hit a few balls with him, you realise that he still has the feeling, the touch. You don\u2019t lose these abilities from one day to another. He is one of the greatest players ever and he is still playing great.\u201d Murray said this comeback felt like the first, six years ago after minor back surgery, but different from his aborted attempt when he rushed his return after his first major hip operation in 2018. \u201cWhen I had my back operation, the pain was significantly better. I had this one [four months ago] and the pain was also significantly better. They feel kind of similar. The operation I had in January last year and the groin surgery just before then, there was no change or difference in my pain. So those comebacks felt quite different to this one because I now have no pain or discomfort. \u201cWhen you get on the court, there is a risk of something happening. I have a metal hip now, so people may worry about that; there are things that could go wrong. But I\u2019m in pretty good shape, I\u2019m healthy and I\u2019ve trained loads. I have done a bunch of rehab. We\u2019ll see how it goes.\u201d Kyle Edmund, meanwhile, returns to the court after a much shorter break, against the top seed, Stefanos Tsitsipas, and the British No 1, still handling a chronic knee injury, says he has nothing to lose. \u201cObviously it\u2019s tough,\u201d he said of the prospect of playing for the first time against the world No 6 who a fortnight ago took an in-form Stan Wawrinka to five sets in the fourth round of the French Open. \u201cHe\u2019s played very well, won a lot this year. But at the same time it\u2019s almost an ideal situation, where there\u2019s no pressure on me to do well. It\u2019s almost everything is on him.\u201d Edmund has not played since the recurrence of a knee injury forced him to quit in the third set against Pablo Cuevas in the second round at Roland Garros nearly three weeks ago. Tsitsipas is taking nothing for granted. \u201cIt can take quite a while to adjust to new conditions, which I haven\u2019t played on for a year now,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think we\u2019re pretty equal.\u201d The Greek with a flair for words and an eye on bigger prizes welcomes the dawning of a new tennis age, although he points out that Alexander Zverev, with whom he has a frosty relationship, is not his only rival. \u201cLet\u2019s focus also on other guys,\u201d he said, \u201clike F\u00e9lix [Auger-Aliassime]; I believe he has big potential; and Alex [de Minaur], Taylor [Fritz], all of these guys. Frances [Tiafoe]. We\u2019re going to have a big, big rivalry in the future. \u201cMy relationship with Sascha [Zverev] is all right. I don\u2019t see him often. When I see him it\u2019s pretty, well ... OK, decent. We both know that we\u2019re going to face each other many times in the future. We both know that one of us is going to win more, one of us is going to win less. That\u2019s the sport that we chose to play. This is a competitive attitude, this daily competition to prove to each other that we\u2019re better.\u201d",

At the same time there was no head of health and safety in place, which for a food business is extraordinary. It was symptomatic of what was going on across the business,\u201d he said. Patisserie Valerie, which at one stage was valued at \u00a3450m, plunged into administration in January after it was unable to secure new bank finance. The black hole in its finances that precipitated the crisis has turned out to be at least \u00a394m. Patisserie Valerie\u2019s finance director, Chris Marsh, was arrested and bailed following the accounting scandal. The Serious Fraud Office has opened a criminal investigation but has not commented further. More than 900 staff lost their jobs in the wake of the collapse and the new company now operates 96 outlets with 2,000 staff. At its height, the chain that started life in London\u2019s Soho in 1926, had almost 200 outlets, employing 3,000 staff around the country. Luke Johnson, Patisserie Valerie\u2019s former executive chairman and its largest shareholder when it collapsed, has said he had no knowledge of the alleged fraud prior to October. Last week, he said he had been tricked by a fake picture of its financial health and questioned the rosy bill of health provided by auditor Grant Thornton. The chain\u2019s collapse had shattered his self-belief and left feeling him physically ill, he said. When asked about Scaife\u2019s claims, first made in an interview with the Sunday Telegraph, Johnson declined to comment further on the basis that a criminal investigation remains ongoing. Six months on from the buyout the \u201cnew\u201d Patisserie Valerie is looking much brighter, Scaife said on Sunday, with plans to replace the outlets\u2019 salmon and brown colour scheme and install a smaller menu. Scaife hosted a meeting of 140 key staff last week to thank them for their hard work in helping turn round the business. \u201cWe are delighted with the progress we have made. We found a lot of problems but we also inherited some great staff who really care about what they do. There\u2019s been a lot of hard work but it\u2019s very much back on track,\u201d said Scaife.",

Favourite clue, of 15 mentioned, was \u2018Prance about \u2013 what you do when hanging a picture?\u2019 for TITUP, well ahead of the rest. By common consent the puzzle as a whole was easier than average, and a few of you suggested that this seemed to be part of a trend. Are the advancing years bringing out a gentler tendency in my cluing? Not deliberately, I can assure you. My aim, as always, is to present you with a reasonably tough challenge (including a fair number of unfamiliar words to appeal to your lexical curiosity) which at the same time is enjoyable to solve.

Favourite clue, of 15 mentioned, was \u2018Prance about \u2013 what you do when hanging a picture?\u2019 for TITUP, well ahead of the rest. By common consent the puzzle as a whole was easier than average, and a few of you suggested that this seemed to be part of a trend. Are the advancing years bringing out a gentler tendency in my cluing? Not deliberately, I can assure you. My aim, as always, is to present you with a reasonably tough challenge (including a fair number of unfamiliar words to appeal to your lexical curiosity) which at the same time is enjoyable to solve.

I think some of it is to do with the fact that they aren\u2019t the most popular team out there \u2013 there\u2019s this perception that the USA are arrogant and everything is excessive and over the top with them.</p> <p>But there is also a perception that women\u2019s football should be all hugs, smiles and kisses \u2013 people do not expect a level of ruthlessness they might see in the men\u2019s game. That kind of win-at-all-costs attitude is perhaps something people don\u2019t expect from women. There\u2019s still that unspoken rule that everything should be all \u201cnicely\u2011nicely\u201d but listen: this is a World Cup.</p> <p>The ruthlessness of the USA team is what every other side in France should aspire to have too. That\u2019s why they are the defending champions.

      "bodyText": "Please join the esteemed Tom Lutz for coverage of USA-Chile. You may notice the USA have changed the lineup. A lot. So NOW they\u2019re resting players. And I\u2019ll stick by 1-0. That\u2019s all for me -- enjoy Tom\u2019s coverage here: StickSports fan also congratulates me on the 5-1 prediction and says it\u2019s OK if I show my dance atop my desk. I\u2019ve lost 30 pounds in 18 months, but I still don\u2019t think my desk would support me. We have a game report ... Predictions Tuvic Tuslow raves that I got my second-half prediction correct by saying Sweden would score again (or twice more) and Thailand might score one. And ... huh. I did. That doesn\u2019t happen often. So, I\u2019m asked, what\u2019s my prediction for USA-Chile? 1-0. Yes. 1-0. Assuming Endler makes a couple of early saves. If she doesn\u2019t, then 6-0. So what\u2019s the difference here between USA-Thailand and Sweden-Thailand? Simply put, Thailand improved. Sweden could easily have exceeded the USA\u2019s tally of three goals in the first half if not for Boonsing. Against the USA, poor goalkeeping contributed to an outright dam break, and if you\u2019ve been on the receiving end of many a blowout, you know the number of goals after that hardly matters. \u201cBut this is the World Cup,\u201d you might say. \u201cA team should be able to hold it together mentally!\u201d Not when few of your players have experience outside the domestic league of Thailand. Thailand managed to get the ball forward and make Sweden respect their counterattack. That made the second half play out a bit differently. The USA would have been a strong favorite against Sweden in whatever odds were made two weeks ago. Those odds shouldn\u2019t change based on comparing these two games. If the USA hammer five goals past Chile, then we\u2019ll talk. Even then, Sweden might be in the USA\u2019s heads after 2016. Sweden closes the game with (according to ESPN\u2019s stats) 35 shots to Thailand\u2019s five. That\u2019s 12 shots on goal, but Boonsing saved five. Boonsing guesses correctly, but the ball is well-struck into the lower left corner with the last kick of the game. Our first of the match comes deep in stoppage time. They want to see if Thailand handled the ball. It\u2019s a header that hits the arm of the unlucky Chinwong, who was running to her left and was moving her arm as someone running normally would. The close-range header hits the arm, and after a check, the ref points to the spot. Again, Sweden lose track of Thailand\u2019s best attacker, and she rips it near post past Lindahl. A wonderful moment for the underdogs. 90 min: The ever-dangerous Sung-Ngoen gets space on the right. With Sembrant closing and no teammates in sight, the Thai forward shoots high. 88 min: Dangda leaves her arm out in an \u201cunnatural position,\u201d and the ball clangs off it. That\u2019ll be a free kick from 28 yards out. The referee sees many things she does not like and moves around to correct them before allowing Rubensson to take the kick. Boonsing can\u2019t find it, but the ball is cleared out. 84 min: A foul 35 yards out gives Thailand a free kick. Phancha sends a harmless-looking ball into the box, but a teammate saves it near the endline and tries to send it back across, only to see Lindahl alertly collect it. At the other end, an exquisitely timed Chinwong tackle stops the Swedish counter. 82 min: That\u2019s deflating for Thailand, as is the departure of Orathai Srimanee, who is grimacing as she leaves. Orapin Waen-Ngoen is the replacement, and she immediately sends a through ball for Sung-Ngoen. Lindahl races out to collect it. Solid cross after a nifty give-and-go on the left flank, emphatically headed into the net from 10 yards out. 77 min: Sweden get five players within eight yards of the goal, but Anveg\u00e5rd puts it in the side netting. She then makes way for Mimmi Larsson. That\u2019s all three subs. Thailand still have two to make. 75 min: Sung-Ngoen gets space on the flank again. Her cross goes through, but Thailand retain possession. Nild plays wide, but it all ends with an overly ambitious effort that will do nothing but tick over Thailand\u2019s shot count. 72 min: Janogy with a few moves on the ball, and her shot is blocked ... by Schough, the Swedish substitute. Probably not the instant impact Schough wanted. 68 min: Tuvic Tuslow offers a prediction of a 4-0 final here. I\u2019ll say five. I think Janogy will be difficult to contain. And maybe Thailand will get one? Fischer has to slide to stop a run from Intamee, and the ball bounces toward a grateful Lindahl. Sweden substitution: Captain Caroline Seger departs, handing the armband to Asllani on her way out, and she\u2019s replaced by Olivia Schough. 65 min: Janogy fights for the ball at the near post and fights with the ref after the ball is ruled to have gone off her out of play. Goal difference update: By this time in the USA-Thailand game, the USA had seven goals. Sweden are stuck on three. 63 min: A break for Thailand. Sung-Ngoen swipes the ball from Seger and is off to the races on the left. She opts to wait for more players to arrive. They do, but they\u2019re all Swedish. That doesn\u2019t help. 62 min: Hurtig commits a foul while trying to reclaim the ball. After the whistle, she shows a bit of petulance and kicks it a few yards forward. The ref allows it. 60 min: If Sweden are thinking about getting 10 more goals to even out the goal difference, they\u2019re not playing that way. They\u2019re still working on their game. Patient buildup leading to quality shots. You know -- the things they\u2019ll need against the USA and in the knockout rounds. I see plenty of tank tops in the stands. Play resumes, and Hurtig is waved back on. 57 min: StickSports Fan again: \u201cNot celebrating would have been patronising and more insulting. Be critics about the actual football, not such irrelevant stuff please!\u201d OK. Jill Ellis should have taken Morgan and Rapinoe, both of whom have a lot of miles on their legs, out of the game for a bit of rest instead of leaving them out there to pile on, because goal difference clearly isn\u2019t going to make a difference in the USA\u2019s fortunes here, while Morgan and Rapinoe\u2019s health absolutely will. Thailand brings on Orathai Srimanee for Thongsombut. Then Hurtig joins Boonsing in the \u201cpainful shot at close range\u201d club, taking one smack to the face. She\u2019s down. 53 min: Two more shots -- Hurtig sends a header just wide off a corner, and Glas takes a mild shot from the top of the area than Boonsing easily snares. Abhijato Sensarma takes me up on my halftime discussion query: \u201cWhat should we talk about at half-time you ask? Okay, here\u2019s my question - what\u2019s the best kit of this World Cup in your opinion?\u201d I\u2019ll say South Africa. Thailand\u2019s trainer is out to take a look at Boonsing, who\u2019s feeling the effects of a shot she had no chance of saving with her hands. Looks like she\u2019ll stay in. One of Thailand\u2019s backups, by the way, plays in the USA at Kennesaw State. That\u2019s a college. 47 min: And right away, Janogy is quick to pounce on a loose ball and smashes it from six yards out. Unfortunately for her and perhaps for Boonsing, the Thai keeper is right there to absorb the brunt of it. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t play soccer any more. (That and my Achilles.) Teams are back on the field as we get a glimpse of Rolf\u00f6 eating a banana. She\u2019s been replaced by Madelen Janogy, who was superb off the bench when Sweden finally broke through Chile\u2019s defense after a weather delay. Scott Bassett writes: \u201cSweden are now ON PACE to equal the 13 goals of the US, since that game, if memory serves, was 3-0 at half time. However, their celebrations are simply not extreme enough. They need to really up their antics if they want to win the disgrace derby. Come on Sweden! You can do it!\u201d Since people want to keep talking about this, here\u2019s a question: Are the USA\u2019s celebrations simply the sign of a team that has a level of tenacity and competitiveness that others don\u2019t have? The rationale that the U.S. women were merely celebrating the first goals of newbies Mallory Pugh and Rose Lavelle doesn\u2019t hold water. Lavelle scored the USA\u2019s seventh goal (her second). Pugh scored No. 11. The rest were all from the long-familiar names -- Morgan, Rapinoe, Lloyd. Maybe it\u2019s just that the same ruthlessness and single-mindedness that led to these celebrations is also the same set of traits that helps the USA succeed? Or maybe not. Only so much armchair psychology we can do. StickSports Fan, who\u2019s either excited about the St. Louis Blues\u2019 Game 7 victory (which I also brought to you via the magic of The Guardian\u2019s live-commentary system) or the start of pro lacrosse season, has an interesting theory ... \u201cMaybe Sweden are just appearing sloppy, but in reality they are...ahem... trying not to celebrate as much because they fear facing irrational wrath from international media over their actions? Who knows.....\u201d I don\u2019t think so. They\u2019ve shot 20 times (Fox says 18, ESPN says 20), on pace to match the USA\u2019s tally against Thailand. The first celebration was a nice pile-up in front of the goal. The next two celebrations weren\u2019t notable. The last meaningful kick is from Anveg\u00e5rd, who produces a solid save from Boonsing, who has surely repaid her coach\u2019s faith in her. So what shall we talk about at halftime? 44 min: Hurtig drops after a rough challenge from Dangda. Our referee plays the advantage. Sweden is not inclined to take it. Dangda receives a yellow and will miss the next and surely final game of this Cup for Thailand. I believe we had a new Laws-mandated one-way drop ball, but the TV cameras declined to show us. The ball pings in and out of the Thai penalty area and falls to Rolf\u00f6, who takes a touch to the top of the arc. Her previous efforts have been lacking. This one isn\u2019t. It\u2019s drilled with some authority. Boonsing does very well to get a hand to it, but she can\u2019t keep it out. That\u2019s a goal to celebrate. 41 min: Sung-Ngoen goes 1v4, shrugs off a challenge and slices a cross toward a well-marked teammate. 39 min: All that said, the shot count is 16-1 in Sweden\u2019s favor. Charles Antaki writes: \u201cThe TV director occasionally cuts to the Thai bench to show a very cool looking woman in an expensive and ostentatiously non-sporting outfit, who the commentator claims is a billionaire who bankrolls the national team. If England had such a person they certainly wouldn\u2019t look so cool - it would be a sweaty, overweight businessman on his mobile phone - say Mike Ashley or, if were truly unlucky, Sir Philip Green.\u201d The USA should counter with Rihanna. 37 min: This is looking like an actual game of soccer, with each team having some possession in midfield and patiently seeking a way through. Thailand\u2019s wildest dream would be just to score once here, but this is competent football. Or, as the English called it until the Americans also started using that name, soccer. 34 min: Sweden concede a free kick in their own half. It lands just shy of the area, but Thailand appear to have forced a corner kick until the AR\u2019s flag goes up. Replay (not VAR) shows the call to be correct, because we ARs are awesome. (Legs still sore from yesterday.) I\u2019m not sure what this is, especially because I\u2019m not getting any sound with it, but I\u2019m mesmerized ... 32 min: Free kick goes the middle of the box again, but it\u2019s farther away from goal, and Eriksson\u2019s header sails over the bar. 31 min: The through ball was on for Sweden, but they botched it. In 2016, Sweden clinically converted on the few chances they had against the USA. This team simply doesn\u2019t appear to be on that level. But we should remember -- the bulk of the USA\u2019s goals were after halftime. This could still fall to pieces for Thailand, and Nild just gave up a needless free kick 28 yards out. 29 min: A pair of Swedish corner kicks produces nothing but a foul. Here\u2019s that Asllani goal: Luke Jones writes: \u201cNormally in a game like this in a big tournament the stands would be full of locals who turned out to cheer for Thailand, or maybe see a historically lopsided defeat. It really is too bad that FIFA or the organizers or whoever made that impossible.\u201d The crowd did seem sparse when the teams walked onto the pitch, but we can see a few pockets of supporters creating a bit of noise when either team has the ball. It\u2019s surely better attendance than Sweden had when it hosted. (In fairness, that was 24 years ago. Women\u2019s soccer has progressed a bit since then.) 25 min: But Sweden, frankly don\u2019t seem up for it. A sloppy pass here and there, then a terrific tackle from Chinwong. And as I type that, Chinwong loses track of Asllani, who can\u2019t direct a pinpoint cross into the net. They\u2019ve been a little wasteful, this Swedish team. If they score against the USA, that would probably send off some alarm bells. 23 min: Rolf\u00f6 with another rash shot. Reminder: Sweden must score, say, 12 goals to put any pressure on the USA in the Battle of Goal Difference. 22 min: Say this for Thailand -- they\u2019re trying to get numbers forward, and they\u2019ve been successful in getting into the opposing third twice, along with a bit of midfield possession. Doesn\u2019t matter who the opposition is -- that was lovely. Hurtig\u2019s header floats toward the far post and forces Boonsing to stretch for a nice save. Asllani collects it with no angle to shoot, then creates an angle to shoot. 2-0. 18 min: A good cross from Hurtig to a spot with two Swedish forwards and two Thai defenders occupying the same spot of grass. The carom is not on goal. 16 min: Shot for Thailand! And it\u2019s not a bad one at all. Sweden can\u2019t break up a Thailand possession, and the ball is crossed back to Nild at the top of the box. Her shot whistles high, but that wasn\u2019t bad. Sweden roars forward in response but produces only a tame shot. Fox kindly shows us the goal ... From email: Someone apparently thinks I\u2019m a European racist black lady. I\u2019d be OK with three of those things, but I am none. I thought we were letting the celebration thing drop ... 12 min: Swedish possession, Swedish possession, corner, foul, goal kick, and ... Thailand possession! Sung-Ngoen gets around the defense and crosses. Sweden forced to clear under pressure. 9 min: Save! OK, it\u2019s somewhat routine, as Rolf\u00f6 fires from the top of the area. But it\u2019s a save. Sweden reclaims the ball, and Rolf\u00f6 gets into the middle of the box, doing the hard work of beating four defenders but putting her shot nowhere near much of anything. Free kick from 35 yards out from the Phancha foul, and it\u2019s fair to say Sweden is going to be better in the air. Rubensson floats it to Sembrant -- defender\u2019s goal! 5 min: Phancha fouls Hurtig and immediately puts her hands up as it to bow or pray. 4 min: Decent chance here, with Eriksson playing a good cross to Asllani, who gets her head or torso to it but can\u2019t direct it goalward. 2 min: At the 1:01 mark, a Thai defender touches the ball. It\u2019s out for a throw-in. Asllani gets impatient and fires from outside the box to the periphery of the stadium. Kickoff: Looks like a lovely day in Nice. And now that the India-Pakistan match has been suspended due to ... you guessed it, rain ... you have no excuse to skip this one. Sweden\u2019s lineup Two changes up front, though supersub Madelen Janogy remains on the bench. Instead, Lina Hurtig and Anna Anveg\u00e5rd replace Sofia Jakobsson and Stina Blackstenius. Lineup, with clubs: GK 1-Hedvig Lindahl (Chelsea) D: 6-Magdalena Eriksson (Chelsea) D: 3-Linda Sembrant (Montpellier) D: 5-Nilla Fischer (Wolfsburg) D: 4-Hanna Glas (PSG) M: 17-Caroline Seger (Rosengard) M: 21-Elin Rubensson (Kopparbergs/G\u00f6teborg) M: 18-Fridolina Rolf\u00f6 (Bayern Munich) M: 9-Kosovare Asllani (Linkopings) M: 8-Lina Hurtig (Linkopings) F: 19-Anna Anveg\u00e5rd (Vaxjo) You can also call Rolf\u00f6 and Hurtig forwards if you like. Honestly, isn\u2019t the difference between a 4-5-1 and a 4-3-3 basically a matter of attitude? You could say Thailand\u2019s in a 4-3-3, but does anyone think they\u2019ll have three players pressing forward? Players in The Guardian\u2019s top 100: Fischer, Seger, Rolf\u00f6, Asllani. Also Blackstenius, who has moved to the bench. From Twitter: Cena was terrific in the Amy Schumer film Trainwreck. Before a nice feature on Nild, the pregame coverage on Fox included a rant from rasslin\u2019 star Hulk Hogan. It must work. After the Coca-Cola Hometown Heroes segment on Crystal Dunn, one of my awesome kids brought me a Coke. It\u2019s Father\u2019s Day, you know. Thailand\u2019s player to watch And we already have an email. Here\u2019s Tim Farnham: \u201cCan you just grow up and move on and do your job and cover Sweden - Thailand, please? You\u2019d think you had a complex about the US - Thailand match or something.\u201d I\u2019m 49 years old. But the last comment on the USA-Thailand game here (barring the occasional \u201ca sub is coming in -- she was a starter against the USA\u201d note) will be this: The player Alex Morgan consoled after that game was Miranda Nild. What do Morgan and Nild have in common, besides that moment? They\u2019re both Cal-Berkeley alumni. Nild finished her outstanding playing career in 2018. So Nild isn\u2019t just the recipient of a good show of sportsmanship from Morgan. She came up through the U.S. women\u2019s soccer gauntlet and excelled. Thailand lineup A few changes from the 0-13 decision against the USA, including the goalkeeper. New players get an asterisk. GK: 1-Waraporn Boonsing* D: 10-Sunisa Srangthaisong, 19-Pitsamail Sornsai*, 3-Natthakarn Chinwong, 5-Ainon Phancha M: 12-Rattikan Thongsombut, 8-Miranda Nild, 6-Pikul Khueanpet*, 7-Silawan Intamee, 17-Taneekarn Dangda* F: 21-Kanjana Sung-Ngoen Khueanpet was a first-half sub against the USA. Dangda was a second-half sub. Dangda had a hat trick in the game against Indonesia, as did Saowalak Pengngam, who\u2019s on the bench. When Thailand scored 13 ... May 27, 2018. Indonesia hosting Thailand. Your goal scorers: Dangda, Saengchan, Saengchan, Intamee, Dangda, Phancha, Boothduang, Dangda, Intamee, Pengngam, Pengngam, Pengngam, Chuchuen. The celebrations were subdued. Even somber. Maybe they watch American baseball, and they know that people who celebrate home runs a bit too much in a rout (or even in a close win) end up taking a fastball in the ribs. Welcome to the Battle of Goal Difference, the most anticipated television event since the Battle of Winterfell. If Sweden do not win by at least 12 goals, taking their goal difference to +14, they\u2019ll need to hope the USA fail to score more than one against Chile. The latter is actually possible, given the presence of Chile\u2019s outstanding goalkeeper Christiane Endler. And if either team falters, then they\u2019ll have more at stake because they\u2019ll need a win rather than a tie to win the group and keep themselves on course for an expected quarterfinal matchup with France. Wait. Is this really a thing to desire? Is it worth scoring a zillion goals rather than resting Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe? OK, OK. We\u2019ll let it go. Here\u2019s Sweden-Thailand. Enjoy. Beau will be here shortly, in the meantime here\u2019s Eni Aluko on that defeat for Thailand: I have to say I\u2019ve been surprised to see some of the reaction to the USA team\u2019s celebrations during the 13\u20110 win against Thailand. I think some of it is to do with the fact that they aren\u2019t the most popular team out there \u2013 there\u2019s this perception that the USA are arrogant and everything is excessive and over the top with them. But there is also a perception that women\u2019s football should be all hugs, smiles and kisses \u2013 people do not expect a level of ruthlessness they might see in the men\u2019s game. That kind of win-at-all-costs attitude is perhaps something people don\u2019t expect from women. There\u2019s still that unspoken rule that everything should be all \u201cnicely\u2011nicely\u201d but listen: this is a World Cup. The ruthlessness of the USA team is what every other side in France should aspire to have too. That\u2019s why they are the defending champions. I don\u2019t really understand the concept that they shouldn\u2019t have celebrated, because it would have been an even bigger disrespect to not celebrate.",

      "body": "<p>Will Britain\u2019s next prime minister have one of the shortest premierships in recent history? Theresa May\u2019s successor is yet to be selected but already talk has turned to whether an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/16/dominic-raab-tories-are-toast-if-they-miss-brexit-october-deadline\" title=\"\">early election is imminent</a>. With Boris Johnson the clear favourite for the job, his pledge to take the UK out of the EU by the end of October \u2013 deal or no deal \u2013 has led a number of Tory MPs to predict that a snap election will soon follow his arrival in 10 Downing Street.</p> \n<p>Johnson\u2019s closest rival, Jeremy Hunt \u2013 who came second in the first ballot \u2013 has accused him of \u201ceffectively committing the country to no deal \u2026 or an election\u201d. Although the former mayor of London has said he plans to negotiate a Brexit deal, there is scepticism that a) Brussels would be willing to cede to his demands, and b) there would be time for such a renegotiation to take place before the end of the article 50 extension on 31 October.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>While a hard Brexit deadline risks an unwelcome trip to the polling booth, a Brexit delay could prove fatal to the party</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Should no new deal materialise, Johnson has said he would take the UK out of the EU without a deal. This is something parliament would likely try to stop \u2013 potentially triggering a general election in the process. Campaign rivals have taken to jesting that they\u2019ll \u201cmeet again in November\u201d for a second leadership contest after the new government collapses.</p> \n<p>Johnson allies dismiss such ideas, suggesting parliament can\u2019t actually stop a no-deal Brexit. However, pro-EU MPs point to John Bercow \u2013 who they describe as an \u201cactivist speaker\u201d \u2013 as the great hope for finding a way to block no deal. Even if Bercow fails to rise to the occasion, there could be enough Tory MPs willing to take the drastic option of voting down their own government to prevent no deal. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/15/kenneth-clarke-bring-down-no-deal-government\" title=\"\">Ken Clarke has said</a> that if push came to shove he would do so, while the work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, used an interview over the weekend to say that she knew of other colleagues prepared to follow suit \u2013 insisting the numbers were there if MPs were pushed.</p> \n<p>Why then are so many Conservative MPs still willing to take a punt on Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy over that of a candidate like Hunt? The former foreign secretary won 114 votes in the first parliamentary party ballot, while Hunt managed 43. The Tory leadership candidates can be divided into two categories \u2013 those willing to delay Brexit (like Hunt) and those willing to risk a host of undesirable outcomes to deliver Brexit on time (like Johnson). At the moment, the latter option is winning.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a4b8465f-bb6b-46cf-9b61-d0767fe8bd40\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZeoPfUt2ShQ?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It\u2019s not that Tory MPs have suddenly warmed to the idea of an early general election \u2013 the bulk are terrified by the prospect. They just feel that these days there are few good choices. While a hard Brexit deadline risks the chance of an unwelcome trip to the polling booth, an indefinite Brexit delay could prove fatal to the party in the long term. Unless Brussels offers concessions, all Brexit choices come with flaws.</p> \n<p>For many MPs, the balance of risk has changed. The success of Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party means that delaying Brexit again is seen as destructive to the Tory party. Johnson told MPs at the One Nation caucus hustings this month: \u201cWe are facing an existential crisis and will not be forgiven if we do not deliver Brexit on 31 October.\u201d</p> \n<p>As one cabinet minister put it to me: \u201cTo delay would be death by a thousand cuts. A general election on a clear Brexit platform is not the worst option.\u201d There\u2019s a sense that any further delay to Brexit could isolate the Tory grassroots and do irreparable damage. Some Tory MPs believe a Prime Minister Johnson could even call an election himself in the event that parliament found a way to thwart no deal, and he found himself unable to fulfil his promises. \u201cThe thing Tory MPs fear is that Boris Johnson calls a general election when no deal is blocked. In order to deliver it, he has to change the composition of the Commons and that means a general election,\u201d one sceptical MP says.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2019/jun/14/tory-leadership-candidates-policies\">Then there were six: policies of remaining Tory contenders</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The hope is that by having a new leader in No 10, the entire mood music will change. Brussels will look to a Brexiteer prime minister and see someone who won\u2019t blink as Theresa May did over a no-deal Brexit. They will see in Johnson someone determined to deliver it and that, his supporters say, ought to lead to Brussels starting to renegotiate.

      "bodyText": "Will Britain\u2019s next prime minister have one of the shortest premierships in recent history? Theresa May\u2019s successor is yet to be selected but already talk has turned to whether an early election is imminent. With Boris Johnson the clear favourite for the job, his pledge to take the UK out of the EU by the end of October \u2013 deal or no deal \u2013 has led a number of Tory MPs to predict that a snap election will soon follow his arrival in 10 Downing Street. Johnson\u2019s closest rival, Jeremy Hunt \u2013 who came second in the first ballot \u2013 has accused him of \u201ceffectively committing the country to no deal \u2026 or an election\u201d. Although the former mayor of London has said he plans to negotiate a Brexit deal, there is scepticism that a) Brussels would be willing to cede to his demands, and b) there would be time for such a renegotiation to take place before the end of the article 50 extension on 31 October. Should no new deal materialise, Johnson has said he would take the UK out of the EU without a deal. This is something parliament would likely try to stop \u2013 potentially triggering a general election in the process. Campaign rivals have taken to jesting that they\u2019ll \u201cmeet again in November\u201d for a second leadership contest after the new government collapses. Johnson allies dismiss such ideas, suggesting parliament can\u2019t actually stop a no-deal Brexit. However, pro-EU MPs point to John Bercow \u2013 who they describe as an \u201cactivist speaker\u201d \u2013 as the great hope for finding a way to block no deal. Even if Bercow fails to rise to the occasion, there could be enough Tory MPs willing to take the drastic option of voting down their own government to prevent no deal. Ken Clarke has said that if push came to shove he would do so, while the work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, used an interview over the weekend to say that she knew of other colleagues prepared to follow suit \u2013 insisting the numbers were there if MPs were pushed. Why then are so many Conservative MPs still willing to take a punt on Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy over that of a candidate like Hunt? The former foreign secretary won 114 votes in the first parliamentary party ballot, while Hunt managed 43. The Tory leadership candidates can be divided into two categories \u2013 those willing to delay Brexit (like Hunt) and those willing to risk a host of undesirable outcomes to deliver Brexit on time (like Johnson). At the moment, the latter option is winning. It\u2019s not that Tory MPs have suddenly warmed to the idea of an early general election \u2013 the bulk are terrified by the prospect. They just feel that these days there are few good choices. While a hard Brexit deadline risks the chance of an unwelcome trip to the polling booth, an indefinite Brexit delay could prove fatal to the party in the long term. Unless Brussels offers concessions, all Brexit choices come with flaws. For many MPs, the balance of risk has changed. The success of Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party means that delaying Brexit again is seen as destructive to the Tory party. Johnson told MPs at the One Nation caucus hustings this month: \u201cWe are facing an existential crisis and will not be forgiven if we do not deliver Brexit on 31 October.\u201d As one cabinet minister put it to me: \u201cTo delay would be death by a thousand cuts. A general election on a clear Brexit platform is not the worst option.\u201d There\u2019s a sense that any further delay to Brexit could isolate the Tory grassroots and do irreparable damage. Some Tory MPs believe a Prime Minister Johnson could even call an election himself in the event that parliament found a way to thwart no deal, and he found himself unable to fulfil his promises. \u201cThe thing Tory MPs fear is that Boris Johnson calls a general election when no deal is blocked. In order to deliver it, he has to change the composition of the Commons and that means a general election,\u201d one sceptical MP says. The hope is that by having a new leader in No 10, the entire mood music will change. Brussels will look to a Brexiteer prime minister and see someone who won\u2019t blink as Theresa May did over a no-deal Brexit. They will see in Johnson someone determined to deliver it and that, his supporters say, ought to lead to Brussels starting to renegotiate. One concession on the Irish backstop and a Brexit deal could pass. But if that plan fails, many MPs still believe having Johnson at the helm is the best option. Speak to Johnson\u2019s supporters and they repeatedly point to what they see as his electability. They believe that the party is in dire straits and he is the man best positioned to take on both Farage and Jeremy Corbyn in a general election \u2013 whether that\u2019s in three months or three years. The crux of the matter: no one in the Tory party is sure how Johnson\u2019s Brexit gamble would play out. However, faced with only difficult decisions on Brexit, a growing number believe that come rain or shine Johnson is the person they want leading from the front. \u2022 Katy Balls is the Spectator\u2019s deputy political editor",

Iran has repeatedly warned it could block the strategic strait of Hormuz in a relatively low-tech, high-impact countermeasure to any attack by the US. Doing so would disrupt oil tankers travelling out of the Gulf region to the Indian Ocean and global export routes. The two damaged tankers arrived safely on Sunday at locations off the Emirati coast. Maritime experts will seek to transfer the highly flammable cargo on board the Kokuka to shore, according to an unnamed official quoted by Japanese state media. The Japanese trade minister, Hiroshige Seko, said at a G20 meeting in Japan on Saturday: \u201cFrom a viewpoint of global energy security, it is necessary for the international community to jointly deal with the act.\u201d Agence France-Presse contributed to this report",

The charity Action for Children estimates that 1.8 million children used Sure Start centres in England in 2017-18 \u2013 down from 2.2 million four years earlier \u2013 a direct consequence, it says, of a 62% cut in council early years service spending since 2010. The charity said it was especially concerned that deprived authorities had reported the biggest reductions in use, at a time when rising poverty was likely to have fuelled demand for parent and child support services in those areas. Numbers of children using Start Start in the 30 most deprived authorities were down by 22%, compared with 12% in the 30 least deprived councils, the study found. Overall, 10 councils reported a decline of more than 50% in children\u2019s centre visits over the four-year period, while a further 47 reported reductions of 20% or more. Sure Start was a flagship New Labour project designed to boost the educational and life chances of socially and economically disadvantaged children. The centres offer childcare and play sessions, parenting advice and employment coaching. At their peak in 2010, there were 3,600 centres, with a budget of about \u00a31.8bn. Between 500 and 1,000 Sure Start centres have closed in England since 2010, according to recent research. But \u201cclosure\u201d figures can mask the way some councils kept centres open while reducing services. Estimating footfall gave a more nuanced view of the impact of funding cuts, the charity said. The research findings \u2013 coupled with the failure of some councils to collect robust data on Sure Start centre use \u2013 raise questions about whether local authorities were meeting their duties to ensure there is adequate children\u2019s centre provision in their area, it added. Last week, campaigners in Buckinghamshire won permission at the high court to challenge plans by Buckinghamshire county council to close 19 of its 35 centres in September. A judicial review hearing in July will consider whether the council has breached its legal duties to provide sufficient Sure Start coverage. Imran Hussain, Action for Children\u2019s director of policy, said despite the importance of children\u2019s centres and their popularity among many families, years of cuts had left councils with little choice but to reduce Sure Start budgets and close centres. As a result, many services were harder to access. \u201cChildren\u2019s centres are unable to continue to reach families across communities, leaving many thousands of new parents with nowhere to turn for early help support \u2013 a far cry from the idea of easily accessible, one-stop-shops within pram-pushing distance,\u201d he said. A recent study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found Sure Start centres in deprived areas that offered high levels of service delivered major health benefits and millions of pounds in NHS savings through reduced hospitalisation. The child poverty expert Naomi Eisenstadt said it was not surprising the largest reductions in use were in the poorest areas containing the biggest concentrations of disadvantaged children as these areas had experienced disproportionately severe government funding cuts. She added that the hollowing out of Sure Start in recent years had swept away outreach services designed to encourage the most disadvantaged and \u201chard to reach\u201d families to come to the centres, and this may also have have impacted on declining take up. Action for Children, which provides 116 children\u2019s centres in England on behalf of councils, said its figures were underestimates, partly because about 20% of all 152 upper tier authorities that responded to its freedom of information requests said they had not collected data on children\u2019s centre use over the full four-year period. A Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cWe want every child to have the best start in life, with the opportunities and the stability to fulfil their potential and since 2013, the disadvantage gap for children at age five has narrowed. \u201cMore than 700,000 of the most disadvantaged two-year-olds have benefited from 15 hours\u2019 free childcare since its introduction in 2013, and 600,000 three- and four-year-olds have benefited from a 30-hours place in the first two years. They added: \u201cWe believe it is up to local councils to decide how to organise and commission services in their areas, as they are best-placed to understand local needs.\u201d",

Like Latham, Grandad has lived through wartime and poverty, is a conceptual artist and a philosopher, and reuses his teabags. (In a cheeky, affectionate coda to a larger work made in tribute to Latham at the Serpentine in 2017, Prouvost placed used teabags out on radiators around the slick gallery.)</p> <p>The irreverent gesture raised eyebrows, but was immediately evocative. We all know a teabag reuser \u2013 many of us indulge in such habits ourselves. \u201cI mean, why not?\u201d says Prouvost. \u201cI reused when we were there and I assisted him.

In her videos she speaks in whispery, confessional tones. Earlier sculptural work features inanimate objects mounted on little plinths \u2013 a pat of butter, a cigarette \u2013 talking with Prouvost\u2019s voice as the spotlight hits them. \u201cYou would turn me on if you put me in your mouth, you know\u201d whispers the e-cigarette.</p> <p>A long-running series of signs, painted in white on black panels, offer ambiguous and intimate statements about the space in which they\u2019re hanging and the reader\u2019s relationship to it: \u201cThis sign exists to make you see the wall better\u201d, \u201cIdealy this sign be spelt wright\u201d, \u201cThis sign wishes to have been read just by you\u201d.</p> <p>A delightful recent book on her work takes the form of a glossary \u2013 or \u201cLegsicon\u201d as it is dubbed in Prouvost speak. Under \u201clanguage\u201d she writes: \u201cHelps communication between humans but also misunderstanding.\u201d Well, quite.</p> <p>Prouvost moved to London aged 18 to study art at Central St Martin\u2019s. Having moved to Flemish-speaking Antwerp five years ago, she finds herself once again between languages and national identities.</p> <p> \u201cI feel a bit foreign everywhere. Yes, France as well,\u201d she admits. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of nice. Of course sometimes you want to engage and have a connection with someone. It [affects] language as well. I think in France, when someone tells me to \u2018fuck off\u2019 in French, you really feel it, but when you\u2019re a foreigner, you\u2019re just: \u2018Well, whatever.\u2019 You take in things with less weight. You\u2019re floating a bit.\u201d As a non-native speaker, she says, \u201cyou have a distance to the word\u201d.</p> <p>Prouvost sees a parallel between her status as \u201can outsider who is part of it\u201d and the act of travelling on the tube, deep below ground: not <em>in</em> the city, but somehow <em>of</em> the city. Sitting on the Jubilee line, we\u2019re ideally placed to make a break for it, extending our subterranean journey under the Channel, over to the continent.</p> <p>I wouldn\u2019t put it past Prouvost to really start digging a tunnel to Europe. Beneath the sweet, playful demeanour she has a solid anti-authoritarian streak and is a determined excavator.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you the way,\u201d she tells me, solemnly. \u201cI hope you\u2019re coming to help me.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Art on the Underground will be displayed at 270 sites across the network, from 20 June to 15 December</p></li> </ul>",

Earlier sculptural work features inanimate objects mounted on little plinths \u2013 a pat of butter, a cigarette \u2013 talking with Prouvost\u2019s voice as the spotlight hits them. \u201cYou would turn me on if you put me in your mouth, you know\u201d whispers the e-cigarette. A long-running series of signs, painted in white on black panels, offer ambiguous and intimate statements about the space in which they\u2019re hanging and the reader\u2019s relationship to it: \u201cThis sign exists to make you see the wall better\u201d, \u201cIdealy this sign be spelt wright\u201d, \u201cThis sign wishes to have been read just by you\u201d. A delightful recent book on her work takes the form of a glossary \u2013 or \u201cLegsicon\u201d as it is dubbed in Prouvost speak. Under \u201clanguage\u201d she writes: \u201cHelps communication between humans but also misunderstanding.\u201d Well, quite. Prouvost moved to London aged 18 to study art at Central St Martin\u2019s. Having moved to Flemish-speaking Antwerp five years ago, she finds herself once again between languages and national identities. \u201cI feel a bit foreign everywhere. Yes, France as well,\u201d she admits. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of nice. Of course sometimes you want to engage and have a connection with someone. It [affects] language as well. I think in France, when someone tells me to \u2018fuck off\u2019 in French, you really feel it, but when you\u2019re a foreigner, you\u2019re just: \u2018Well, whatever.\u2019 You take in things with less weight. You\u2019re floating a bit.\u201d As a non-native speaker, she says, \u201cyou have a distance to the word\u201d. Prouvost sees a parallel between her status as \u201can outsider who is part of it\u201d and the act of travelling on the tube, deep below ground: not in the city, but somehow of the city. Sitting on the Jubilee line, we\u2019re ideally placed to make a break for it, extending our subterranean journey under the Channel, over to the continent. I wouldn\u2019t put it past Prouvost to really start digging a tunnel to Europe. Beneath the sweet, playful demeanour she has a solid anti-authoritarian streak and is a determined excavator. \u201cI\u2019ll show you the way,\u201d she tells me, solemnly. \u201cI hope you\u2019re coming to help me.\u201d Art on the Underground will be displayed at 270 sites across the network, from 20 June to 15 December",

Andy Burnham called on the government for more public transport parity, claiming \u201cthere is no \u2018northern powerhouse\u2019\u201d without increased fairness in the way transport subsidies are managed. Burnham was speaking after more than 30 newspapers and news websites in the north of England demanded \u201ca revolution\u201d in how the region is treated by government. Along with dozens of regional politicians and business leaders, papers including the Manchester Evening News, Liverpool Echo, Sheffield Star and Newcastle Journal, called for \u201ca fundamental shift in decision-making out of London, giving devolved powers and self-determination to people in the north\u201d. In an interview on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Burnham claimed successive governments of \u201call colours\u2019 had failed the north of England. The mayor was questioned about his campaign promise to overhaul the region\u2019s bus network. In 2017, legislation handed Burnham and local councils powers over buses and he has until the end of this year to decide how to deploy them. Options include entering into a partnership with operators or setting up a franchised system that would dictate fares, routes, timetables and ticketing.

It is time we are given the same investment that London has had for decades.

The poll of 1,000 people found 76% wanted the system fully regulated for the first time since 1986 and 82% agreed that \u201cas local authorities provide public money for the bus network, they should have more control over bus services\u201d. If regulated, the mayor and councillors would be able to use franchising powers to dictate how the network was managed and simplify the fare structure, something they have been unable to do since bus services outside London were deregulated more than 30 years ago.",

Bedoya was investigating rightwing paramilitary death squads; on her way to an interview with an imprisoned militia leader in May 2000 she was abducted, drugged, gang-raped and tortured. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an interview, it was a trap,\u201d Bedoya said. \u201cIn my head there no timeline because so much was happening that I didn\u2019t even know where I was.\u201d In May, two of the men who attacked Bedoya were sentenced to decades in prison in a rare victory against impunity, but watchdogs have warned that threats and attacks on Colombian reporters are once again on the rise \u2013 particularly in isolated rural areas. Last year, the Bogot\u00e1-based Foundation for Press Freedom (or Flip) documented 477 attacks and threats against journalists, up 53% on 2017; three Colombian journalists were killed, up from one in 2017. A 2016 peace deal with the leftist rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) was supposed to usher in a peaceful chapter in Colombia, but violence still rages as dissident guerrilla factions and rightwing paramilitaries battle for control of territory once held by Farc. Activists and social leaders have been targeted at unprecedented levels: 702 have been murdered since the accord was signed, while 135 ex-combatants have also been killed. Meanwhile, Colombia\u2019s president, Iv\u00e1n Duque, has been accused of undermining the implementation of the accords, attacking the special reconciliatory tribunal it created and its provisions for rural development. This is against a backdrop of increasingly difficult territory for journalists. \u201cThis is particularly worrying as these are places where armed groups are most present and information is harder to access,\u201d said Flip\u2019s Pedro Vaca. \u201cIn Colombia there are few national media outlets, so local reporting becomes more vital, and attacks against one journalist lead to a culture of self-censorship.\u201d International media have also had their work impeded: the New York Times correspondent Nicholas Casey and photographer Federico R\u00edos Escobar were forced to leave the country after a revealing a military order that encouraged kill quotas for enemy combatants. Members of the governing Democratic Centre party attacked Casey on Twitter, with one senator, Mar\u00eda Fernanda Cabal, accusing him of having links to the rebels. When it emerged that respected local weekly Semana also had the scoop but decided not to publish it, one of the magazine\u2019s headline columnists, Daniel Coronell, criticised it in its own pages in late May. He was sacked later that week though later reinstated after a public outcry. When justice is served, it is painfully slow. Bedoya was left for dead after the May 2000 attack, but she was eventually forced to undertake her own investigation of the crime after the official inquiry went nowhere. \u201cThe authorities essentially didn\u2019t investigate for years,\u201d Bedoya said. \u201cSo after wanting to be alone, after wanting to kill myself, I had to do it myself.\u201d Nineteen years later, two former paramilitaries, Alejandro C\u00e1rdenas Orozco and Jes\u00fas Emiro Pereira Rivera, were finally sentenced in May to 40 and 30 years respectively for their roles in the attack. More than two dozen other suspects have not been charged. \u201cThat day people were congratulating me, but I decided to turn off my phone, stay off social media, and I shut myself in my house because I had nothing to celebrate,\u201d Bedoya said.

      "body": "<p>Sara Netanyahu, the wife of Israel\u2019s prime minister, has been convicted of illegally misusing thousands of pounds of public funds on lavish meals.</p> <p>A Jerusalem court on Sunday accepted a plea bargain in which Netanyahu agreed to admit to a lesser charge than the original fraud accusations. She will pay about $15,000 (\u00a312,000) in fines and reimbursements to the state.</p> <p>The sentencing ended one of the long-running cases against the family. However, Benjamin Netanyahu still faces the prospect of three corruption indictments later this year that may end his decade as leader and even result in a prison sentence. He denies all charges.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/sara-netanyahu-charged-misuse-public-funds-israel\">original indictment</a> against Sara Netanyahu, of fraud and breach of trust, she and a government employee were accused of spending roughly $100,000 (\u00a379,000) on catering from expensive restaurants between 2010 and 2013, despite having a in-house cook provided by the state.</p> <p>In Sunday\u2019s settlement, she admitted to taking unfair advantage of another person\u2019s mishandling of state money and reduced the overspending charge to $50,000. Former caretaker Ezra Saidoff also reached an agreement with the prosecution and was fined $3,000.</p> <p>\u201cAs in every plea bargain, each side makes concessions, sometimes hard concessions,\u201d said the prosecutor, Erez Padan, at the Jerusalem magistrates court. \u201cIt is right and proper for the public interest to bring this case to an end.\u201d</p> <p>Netanyahu\u2019s lawyer, Yossi Cohen, told the court his client had already been punished by public humiliation in the closely watched investigation. \u201cFour years of ugly leaks and denigrations\u201d constituted \u201cinhuman punishment\u201d, he said.</p> <p>\u201cNo other person could have withstood this. This lady is made of steel,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The 60-year-old child psychologist has been a controversial presence at her husband\u2019s side throughout his political career. In addition to the fraud case, she has faced mistreatment accusations from employees and was described in a newspaper as <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-sara-netanyahu-israels-marie-antoinette-1.5336821\">\u201cIsrael\u2019s Marie Antoinette\u201d</a>.</p> <p>In 2017, Netanyahu was <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/In-legal-blow-to-Netanyahus-court-grants-familys-ex-aide-win-in-labor-case-483728\">ordered to pay</a> tens of thousands of pounds in damages in a dispute with two former domesticstaff who accused her of bullying.

She was angry with him for not highlighting her professional qualifications in the press.</p> <p>\u201cBA, MA,\u201d she was heard shouting, exclaiming each syllable in reference to her bachelor and master\u2019s degrees.

      "bodyText": "Sara Netanyahu, the wife of Israel\u2019s prime minister, has been convicted of illegally misusing thousands of pounds of public funds on lavish meals. A Jerusalem court on Sunday accepted a plea bargain in which Netanyahu agreed to admit to a lesser charge than the original fraud accusations. She will pay about $15,000 (\u00a312,000) in fines and reimbursements to the state. The sentencing ended one of the long-running cases against the family. However, Benjamin Netanyahu still faces the prospect of three corruption indictments later this year that may end his decade as leader and even result in a prison sentence. He denies all charges. According to the original indictment against Sara Netanyahu, of fraud and breach of trust, she and a government employee were accused of spending roughly $100,000 (\u00a379,000) on catering from expensive restaurants between 2010 and 2013, despite having a in-house cook provided by the state. In Sunday\u2019s settlement, she admitted to taking unfair advantage of another person\u2019s mishandling of state money and reduced the overspending charge to $50,000. Former caretaker Ezra Saidoff also reached an agreement with the prosecution and was fined $3,000. \u201cAs in every plea bargain, each side makes concessions, sometimes hard concessions,\u201d said the prosecutor, Erez Padan, at the Jerusalem magistrates court. \u201cIt is right and proper for the public interest to bring this case to an end.\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s lawyer, Yossi Cohen, told the court his client had already been punished by public humiliation in the closely watched investigation. \u201cFour years of ugly leaks and denigrations\u201d constituted \u201cinhuman punishment\u201d, he said. \u201cNo other person could have withstood this. This lady is made of steel,\u201d he added. The 60-year-old child psychologist has been a controversial presence at her husband\u2019s side throughout his political career. In addition to the fraud case, she has faced mistreatment accusations from employees and was described in a newspaper as \u201cIsrael\u2019s Marie Antoinette\u201d. In 2017, Netanyahu was ordered to pay tens of thousands of pounds in damages in a dispute with two former domesticstaff who accused her of bullying. She faces a third lawsuit from an employee who alleged staff were treated like \u201cslaves\u201d. Last year, an audio recording emerged of Netanyahu furiously scolding a family publicist over a gossip column. She was angry with him for not highlighting her professional qualifications in the press. \u201cBA, MA,\u201d she was heard shouting, exclaiming each syllable in reference to her bachelor and master\u2019s degrees. Her husband responded to public shock over the tirade, saying on Facebook that everyone \u201cgets angry and says a few words that [they] didn\u2019t mean\u201d. Benjamin Netanyahu is entangled in a series of more severe corruption investigations and is due to appear at a pre-trial hearing in October after Israel\u2019s attorney general announced his intention to indict in all three cases. He could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted of bribery and a maximum three-year term for fraud and breach of trust. One case, called Case 1,000, involves allegations of receiving gifts, including cigars, champagne and jewellery, from billionaires, among them the Australian casino operator James Packer, allegedly in exchange for favours. In Case 2,000, Netanyahu is accused of colluding with the country\u2019s top-selling newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, to hurt its competition in exchange for favourable coverage. The third and most damning, Case 4,000, involves allegations that Netanyahu offered incentives to the Israeli telecoms provider Bezeq in exchange for positive stories on an online news website it owns. Netanyahu has denied all accusations, dismissing them as part of a witch-hunt orchestrated by the press. He will fight for re-election in September, weeks before the pre-trial hearing is due to start. A win for Netanyahu has been portrayed domestically as a lifeline to block the graft cases as some of his parliamentary allies have suggested they might back laws to grant him immunity.

That\u2019s what you sign up for when you go to see Carr: a grubby pleasure that may be more grubby than pleasure. We know we shouldn\u2019t. We\u2019ll regret it afterwards. There\u2019s certainly no deviation tonight from the formula that\u2019s served Carr well \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/may/11/jimmy-carr-funny-business-review-dorking-halls\">commercially if not always creatively</a> \u2013 for 20 years: blue humour, playground abuse, jokes about rape and paedophilia, and (according to taste) just enough wit and joke-writing flair to keep the stench and squalor at bay.</p> <p>Who knows what need Carr\u2019s comedy is meeting in some of us for jokes about dwarves, fat women and FGM? Carr\u2019s closing apologia insists he doesn\u2019t mean to hurt anyone, that his material is \u201cjoyful\u201d in intent. And certainly there is some subversive joy in having humour applied to such subjects. Deep-rooted convention is destabilised when Carr appears to laugh at the Nazi extermination of Gypsies. We gasp at the flouted taboo, then laugh to recall that \u2013 here at least \u2013 there are no consequences.</p> <p>Or no immediate ones. But, even if you agree that all subjects are fair game for comedy, Carr\u2019s relentless downward kicking (\u201cIs a dwarf an abortion that made it?\u201d) argues that jokes about lesbians, Gypsies and sexual violence aren\u2019t just acceptable, but something \u2013 over two long hours \u2013 to revel in. Many of his one-liners are barely jokes at all, just boorish cliches about vegans being boring or Germany being humourless. And you can\u2019t miss the \u201cmy mother-in-law\u201d echoes in his battery of one-liners (some neat, all unlovely) that each begin, \u201cMy girlfriend \u2026\u201d</p> <p>By that stage, I wasn\u2019t feeling the joy.

      "bodyText": "\u2018Welcome to 90 minutes of your life you\u2019re never getting back,\u201d runs the caption at the start of Jimmy Carr\u2019s touring show, Terribly Funny. That\u2019s what you sign up for when you go to see Carr: a grubby pleasure that may be more grubby than pleasure. We know we shouldn\u2019t. We\u2019ll regret it afterwards. There\u2019s certainly no deviation tonight from the formula that\u2019s served Carr well \u2013 commercially if not always creatively \u2013 for 20 years: blue humour, playground abuse, jokes about rape and paedophilia, and (according to taste) just enough wit and joke-writing flair to keep the stench and squalor at bay. Who knows what need Carr\u2019s comedy is meeting in some of us for jokes about dwarves, fat women and FGM? Carr\u2019s closing apologia insists he doesn\u2019t mean to hurt anyone, that his material is \u201cjoyful\u201d in intent. And certainly there is some subversive joy in having humour applied to such subjects. Deep-rooted convention is destabilised when Carr appears to laugh at the Nazi extermination of Gypsies. We gasp at the flouted taboo, then laugh to recall that \u2013 here at least \u2013 there are no consequences. Or no immediate ones. But, even if you agree that all subjects are fair game for comedy, Carr\u2019s relentless downward kicking (\u201cIs a dwarf an abortion that made it?\u201d) argues that jokes about lesbians, Gypsies and sexual violence aren\u2019t just acceptable, but something \u2013 over two long hours \u2013 to revel in. Many of his one-liners are barely jokes at all, just boorish cliches about vegans being boring or Germany being humourless. And you can\u2019t miss the \u201cmy mother-in-law\u201d echoes in his battery of one-liners (some neat, all unlovely) that each begin, \u201cMy girlfriend \u2026\u201d By that stage, I wasn\u2019t feeling the joy. But then, joy isn\u2019t exclusively what Carr\u2019s humour is about. It\u2019s a mug\u2019s game trying to parse other people\u2019s laughter, but at some points \u2013 as with the applause that greets a weak joke championing the use of gendered sexual swearwords \u2013 there seems to be some free-at-last sense of escape at play from the liberal consensus on what we are and aren\u2019t supposed to say. It\u2019s immaterial to point out that Carr, like many other middle-aged male standups, broadcasters and columnists, has been saying this stuff for years and no one has censored or marginalised him yet. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Carr is perfectly capable of joking across wider territory \u2013 as with the pert gag about Meghan Markle\u2019s feminism. I did find this show a little funnier than its recent predecessors \u2013 the quality of the wordplay a mite higher, the thuggishness less relentless.

And he shows no signs of surrendering it. \u2022 At Buxton Opera House, 18 June; Floral Pavilion, New Brighton, 19 June; then touring.",

Women were not deemed capable of that sort of thing.\u201d Accidental Agent proved 12 months ago that the latest Johnson Houghton in charge at Woodway is more than capable. He was a big outsider and so, in some eyes, a lucky winner but his trainer is unconcerned. Without Parole, a year younger than Accidental Agent, won a Group One over a mile later in the afternoon but finished behind her runner at Newbury last month. \u201cThey said they weren\u2019t very good four-year-olds last year and the three-year-olds were better,\u201d she says, \u201cbut Without Parole didn\u2019t get anywhere near them at Newbury, he hasn\u2019t proven himself from that generation. \u201cHe can only beat the horses in front of him, and if they\u2019re not as good as the horses of 10 years ago, so what? Who cares? I won.\u201d",

The shows are a spin-off from The Red Hand Files, the regular emails he sends to fans, in which he answers questions about meaty subjects such as God, evil and grief. (A moving post about the death of his teenage son, Arthur, went viral last November.)</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about intimacy and connectedness,\u201d Cave says tonight, introducing the unusual setup. Between the interactions he plays piano-only versions of his songs, the choices dictated by random requests and the chat that emerges. \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying,\u201d he says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/27/nick-cave-red-hand-files\">Nick Cave is showing us a new, gentler way to use the internet | Russell Cunningham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cave whippets around the stage in a golden-brown suit. A mix of people sit on chairs behind him, AA-meeting style; they have been selected indiscriminately, he says \u2013 \u201cThey haven\u2019t got VIP passes.\u201d Ushers with microphones roam the crowd as hands fly up. Initially, the exchanges resemble unburdenings to a preacher. A woman who lost her daughter to a brain tumour thanks him for playing God Is in the House. A lifelong fan tells him about his terminal cancer, and how he\u2019d often fall asleep during treatment before hearing his favourite song, Jubilee Street, on 2013\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/feb/14/nick-cave-push-sky-review\">Push the Sky Away</a>. But, after delivering his sympathies tenderly, Cave jokes, \u201cSlap him awake\u201d before singing the song beautifully.</p> <p>Cave makes a convincing standup. He has the best answer for someone who asks if his wife can cuddle him (\u201cJoin the queue, love\u201d) and goes full Bernard Manning answering a question about working away (\u201cMy wife doesn\u2019t want me at home after two weeks\u201d). There are also some curveballs. \u201cWhat\u2019s occurring?\u201d asks a Gavin and Stacey fan (\u201cIs that Welsh?\u201d), while another fan bizarrely duels with him about the koala, his favourite animal. \u201cIt\u2019d tear your face off,\u201d Cave rails.</p> <p>The glut of fans professing adoration gets wearing, but Cave\u2019s nuanced thoughts about art and morality, songwriting and stage nerves are fascinating. When he confesses to talking to Arthur each night before going on stage, you can hear a pin drop. \u201cTo go on stage with that person: all fear evaporates.

      "bodyText": "Conversations With Nick Cave, a series of performances that the musician began in Australia last year, sits somewhere between intimate gig and group therapy session. The shows are a spin-off from The Red Hand Files, the regular emails he sends to fans, in which he answers questions about meaty subjects such as God, evil and grief. (A moving post about the death of his teenage son, Arthur, went viral last November.) \u201cIt\u2019s about intimacy and connectedness,\u201d Cave says tonight, introducing the unusual setup. Between the interactions he plays piano-only versions of his songs, the choices dictated by random requests and the chat that emerges. \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying,\u201d he says. Cave whippets around the stage in a golden-brown suit. A mix of people sit on chairs behind him, AA-meeting style; they have been selected indiscriminately, he says \u2013 \u201cThey haven\u2019t got VIP passes.\u201d Ushers with microphones roam the crowd as hands fly up. Initially, the exchanges resemble unburdenings to a preacher. A woman who lost her daughter to a brain tumour thanks him for playing God Is in the House. A lifelong fan tells him about his terminal cancer, and how he\u2019d often fall asleep during treatment before hearing his favourite song, Jubilee Street, on 2013\u2019s Push the Sky Away. But, after delivering his sympathies tenderly, Cave jokes, \u201cSlap him awake\u201d before singing the song beautifully. Cave makes a convincing standup. He has the best answer for someone who asks if his wife can cuddle him (\u201cJoin the queue, love\u201d) and goes full Bernard Manning answering a question about working away (\u201cMy wife doesn\u2019t want me at home after two weeks\u201d). There are also some curveballs. \u201cWhat\u2019s occurring?\u201d asks a Gavin and Stacey fan (\u201cIs that Welsh?\u201d), while another fan bizarrely duels with him about the koala, his favourite animal. \u201cIt\u2019d tear your face off,\u201d Cave rails. The glut of fans professing adoration gets wearing, but Cave\u2019s nuanced thoughts about art and morality, songwriting and stage nerves are fascinating. When he confesses to talking to Arthur each night before going on stage, you can hear a pin drop. \u201cTo go on stage with that person: all fear evaporates. Nothing can go wrong because everything has gone wrong.\u201d His singing is also extraordinary in this intimate setting. A double header of Leonard Cohen\u2019s Avalanche (the first song he loved) and The Mercy Seat takes your breath away. So do versions of Brompton Oratory and Into My Arms from 1997\u2019s The Boatman\u2019s Call, his whispers as controlled as his velvety bellows. But the best moment is the rawest. Asked to perform a Grinderman track, he plays Palaces of Montezuma (\u201cI\u2019ve never done this before\u201d), messes it up, starts again and nails it. \u201cThat was awesome!,\u201d he cheers, and it is.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has been criticised for spreading the \u201chateful and divisive\u201d rhetoric of Katie Hopkins as part of an attack on the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. The US president was widely condemned on Sunday for quoting the far right commentator as part of his latest broadside against Khan, whom he accused of being \u201ca disaster\u201d for the capital who would \u201conly get worse!\u201d. He retweeted a Hopkins post in which she referred to London as \u201cstab-city\u201d and \u201cKhan\u2019s Londonistan\u201d following the deaths of three men in separate attacks on Friday and Saturday. Trump followed his message a few hours later with further criticism of Khan: \u201cHe is a national disgrace who is destroying the City of London!\u201d While a spokesperson for Khan said he was not going to \u201cwaste his time\u201d responding to the tweet, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said it was \u201cabsolutely awful to see [Donald Trump] using the tragedy of people being murdered to attack the mayor\u201d. He wrote: \u201c[Sadiq Khan] is rightly supporting the police to do their job while Katie Hopkins spreads hateful and divisive rhetoric. They seek to divide at a time we need to come together.\u201d Trump\u2019s post followed the stabbing to death of a man in Wandsworth, south-west London, shortly before 4.45pm on Friday, while another man was shot dead in Greenwich, in the south-east of the capital, at about 5pm the same day. On Saturday afternoon, a man in his 30s was stabbed to death in Tower Hamlets, east London. After the first two deaths Khan said he was \u201csickened to hear that two young lives have been ended within minutes of each other\u201d. He added: \u201cOur overstretched police are working around the clock to keep Londoners safe.\u201d A spokesman for the mayor said: \u201cSadiq is focusing on supporting London\u2019s communities and overstretched emergency services. He has been in regular touch with senior Met police officers last night and throughout the day. His thoughts are with the victims\u2019 families. He is not going to waste his time responding to this sort of tweet.\u201d The Muslim Council of Britain led calls for government figures to speak out against Trump\u2019s decision to retweet Hopkins. A spokesman for the group said: \u201cWhatever political differences our government or the Conservative party may have with Sadiq Khan, we would expect a clear and swift condemnation of Donald Trump\u2019s consistent endorsement of British bigots. \u201cOnce again the president of the United States has insulted the British people by sharing information from a well-known pedlar of hatred. This particular tweet points heavily to Islamophobic tropes against our capital city and its Muslim mayor.\u201d They pointed to the occasion in 2017 when Trump retweeted a handful of anti-Muslim videos posted by the deputy leader of the far-right group Britain First, an act that was criticised by the prime minister and home secretary. \u201cSilence on the issue is unacceptable for Muslim communities across the country, and demonstrates an alarming tolerance of Islamophobia in our country,\u201d they said. Naz Shah, a shadow equalities minister, said the fact that Trump could endorse people who use \u201cracist tropes\u201d and not provoke a response from the prime minister or Conservative party leadership candidates set a dangerous precedent. \u201cMinority communities are directly impacted when hatred and bigoted views are legitimised. Those communities will be looking at who will stand up for them?\u201d she said. \u201cSo far, there is nothing but deafening silence from this Conservative government.\u201d Hopkins\u2019 original tweet was posted alongside two screenshots of BBC News articles detailing the violence. She wrote: \u201c20 hours in Stab-City UPDATE. 2 stabbed to death. 1 shot dead. Three stabbed - but not dead. Wandsworth &amp; Tower Hamlets. This is Khan\u2019s Londonistan.\u201d Trump\u2019s hostility to Khan dates from 2015 when they were both fighting election campaigns and Khan criticised Trump\u2019s presidential campaign pledge to ban Muslims from the US as \u201coutrageous\u201d. The following May, Khan described Trump\u2019s views on Muslims as \u201cignorant\u201d, prompting Trump to challenge Khan to an IQ test. \u201cI will remember those statements. They are very nasty statements,\u201d said Trump. In June 2017, after Trump was elected president, he falsely suggested in a tweet that Khan had said there was \u201cno reason to be alarmed\u201d after the terrorist attacks in Borough Market and London Bridge. Khan had actually said the public should not be alarmed by the increased police presence on London\u2019s streets. Khan then called on the government to cancel Trump\u2019s state visit to the UK, saying \u201chis policies go against everything we stand for\u201d. His office gave permission for anti-Trump protesters to fly a protest blimp of Trump as a crying baby in a nappy. Earlier this month, just before arriving in the UK, Trump described Khan as \u201ca stone cold loser\u201d and \u201cvery dumb\u201d. He said Khan reminded him of the Democrat mayor of New York Bill de Blasio, \u201cwho has also done a terrible job \u2013 only half his height\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "When Jos\u00e9 Selgas and Luc\u00eda Cano unveiled their striking translucent wavy tunnel pavilion at London\u2019s Serpentine Gallery in 2015, it was variously described as a psychedelic pupa, a trippy womb, a rainbow wormhole and \u2013 perhaps key to its runaway success \u2013 an Instagrammer\u2019s paradise. Now it has gone trippy in a whole new sense, because it is being moved across the ocean to Los Angeles, where it is being reconstructed piece by piece for a summer of cultural happenings and intense community conversations. Even trippier, perhaps, is the fact that its landing spot is a public park next to the La Brea Tar Pits, where mammoths, sabre-toothed cats and other fearsome prehistoric creatures once roamed, only to sink for posterity into a black, goopy swamp and leave their fossilized bones for scientists to dig up and pore over. It promises, in short, to set up an unforgettable encounter between 50,000 BC and the 21st century, in which the prehistoric creatures\u2019 unfortunate fate will provide the backdrop for a discussion of the continuing, fraught relationship between the human inhabitants of modern Los Angeles and their disaster-prone natural surroundings. Oh, and David Lynch, perhaps the trippiest of modern film directors, will be on hand with some transcendental meditation. This wild and intriguing idea is the brainchild of Second Home, the co-working space company that wants the rest of us to rethink how we create and interact and, not coincidentally, commissioned Selgas and Cano to design its avant-garde first building off Brick Lane in east London. The transplanted pavilion is both an embodiment of Second Home\u2019s ideals and a calling card for its new co-work space racing toward completion in the heart of Hollywood. Sam Aldenton, one of the company\u2019s co-founders, had the idea of moving to Los Angeles \u2013 and using the pavilion to help him do it \u2013 almost as soon as the Serpentine Pavilion was up and running. A slightly mad idea, perhaps, and one that ended up taking close to four years to realise. \u201cA mixture of naivety and optimism\u201d is how Aldenton described it to the Observer on a tour of the concrete basin and partially erected tunnels three weeks before the scheduled 27 June opening. It\u2019s also explicitly a \u201clove letter\u201d from Aldenton and his high-powered team of expatriate Brits to the city they areadopting. The way they see it, they are merely aping the \u201cwild act of imagination\u201d that inspired the artists, architects, engineers and entrepreneurs before them who willed LA out of the desert. \u201cLike them,\u201d they write in a manifesto, \u201cwe\u2019ve fallen in love with the possibilities of Los Angeles. And at the same time, we\u2019re captivated by its flaws. Its madness and its chaos.\u201d The madness will involve free picnics, an outdoor screening of Raiders of the Lost Ark, a community culture marathon in which a variety of not-for-profit organizations will brainstorm and exchange ideas, a night of readings and discussion about the earthquakes, fires, landslides and drought that guarantee to make southern California unceasingly interesting. The assumption is that the tunnels themselves will be a compelling attraction, along a strip of Wilshire Boulevard that also includes the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, an automotive museum, a folk art museum and \u2013 coming soon \u2013 a museum celebrating the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the folks that bring you the Oscars. Lori Bettison-Varga, who directs both the Tar Pits museum and its sister institution across town, the Museum of Natural History, acknowledges that hosting the pavilion is \u201ca step outside the normal\u201d. But she also loves the idea of her museum building on the community space in the park to give people a stronger sense of the link between the climate change of the last Ice Age and the disruptions the world is enduring now. She also happens to be contemplating a major architectural overhaul of the Tar Pits to emphasize its relationship with the community and the city and sees the summer happenings as a great way to test the ideas she wants to incorporate in her new design. \u201cWe can have conversations around urbanism and public space and the environment and ask \u2013 what does it mean to be in a biodiversity hot spot and appreciate nature every day?\u201d Bettison-Varga said. \u201cThis is a great pilot for us.\u201d Aldenton is betting that Los Angeles, of all places, will grasp the idea at the heart of Second Home\u2019s experiment: that people have their most original ideas when they are thrown into unfamiliar surroundings with people they may not have thought to talk to.

      "bodyText": "10 summer whites Animus Vinho Verde Portugal 2018 (\u00a34.79, Aldi) A sprightly, citrusy dry white with just enough fruit. Relatively low in alcohol, so just right for summer lunchtime drinking, preferably in the sun and with a plate of fish or seafood. Tesco Finest SR Australia 2017 (\u00a39, Tesco) The pair of wines \u2013 see also the red GSM 2016 (\u00a39) \u2013 made for Tesco by South Australian producer d\u2019Arenberg are consistently among the best buys in the retailer\u2019s range. This sauvignon-riesling blend is an aromatic, lime-juicy delight. Taste the Difference Juran\u00e7on Sec France 2018 (\u00a39, Sainsbury\u2019s) In the foothills of the Pyrenees, Juran\u00e7on is home to two of France\u2019s finest but least well-known white grapes, petit and gros manseng, which dovetail here for an electric mix of tangy grapefruit and juicy exotic fruit. Marks &amp; Spencer Petit Chablis France 2017 (\u00a311, Marks &amp; Spencer) In the hands of La Chablisienne, one of France\u2019s better-run co-operatives, chardonnay from petit chablis can offer much of the charm of chablis proper at more humble prices, here with a silvery-flash of acidity and Cox\u2019s apple. Loraxel Cora Pened\u00e8s, Spain 2018 (\u00a313.50, lescaves.co.uk) Best known for the role it plays in cava, Catalan grape xarel-lo also makes highly individual dry white wines, with this breezy natural example offering crisp fresh pear and lemon and a salty streak that would suit shellfish. Thymiopoulos Atma White Naoussa, Greece 2018 (from \u00a312.99, shop.vinoteca.co.uk; borderswines.co.uk) Greek whites are among the most evocatively summery around, and this charming blend of the juice (but not skins) of red grape xinomavro and fragrant malagousia is alive with honeysuckle, blossom and white peachiness. Star Buy: Domaine Cady Cheninsolite Anjou, Loire, France 2017 (\u00a313.99, Waitrose) Rich and full but perfectly balanced with pinpoint clarity, this barrel-fermented 100% chenin blanc mixes fresh and baked apple with honey and luminous acidity. Fresh enough for meaty fish; robust enough for roast pork or chicken. Bodegas Hidalgo Manzanilla En Rama Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda, Jerez, Spain NV (from \u00a316.99, Waitrose; leaandsandeman.co.uk; uncorked.co.uk) The en rama style is dry sherry at its freshest, released each year unfiltered and straight from the barrel. Hidalgo\u2019s is always one of the best, with yeasty, nutty, sourdough notes it\u2019s full-flavoured but salty like sea-spray. Hofst\u00e4tter Villa Barthenau Vigna S Michele Pinot Bianco Alto-Adige, Italy 2016 (\u00a322.50, thewinesociety.com) A rather ho-hum variety, pinot bianco (aka pinot blanc) is made into a wine of pure delight here, with silkiness balanced by mountain-stream freshness, and white fruit lifted by blossom, spice and fragrant herbs. David Franz Long Gully Road Ancient Vine Semillon Barossa Valley, Australia 2017 (from \u00a325, shop.vinoteca.co.uk; thegoodwineshop.co.uk) Made from 129-year-old semillon vines, this modern classic from rising star winemaker David Franz is a gorgeous mix of drowsy summer day hay-and-grassiness, lime cordial tanginess, silky richness and lightness of alcohol. 10 summer reds Recchia Bardolino Veneto, Italy 2018 (\u00a37.99, reduced to \u00a35.99 until 9 July, Waitrose) Made from the same grape varieties as valpolicella, this refreshingly unoaked, light (12.5%) red north Italian bargain is best served a little chilled and is all about the uninhibited red cherry fruit, fresh acidity and gentle tannins. Star buy: Co-op Irresistible Australian Shiraz Mount Benson, Australia 2018 (\u00a37.25, The Co-op) When so much sub-\u00a310 Aussie shiraz is sickly and jammy, this is a real find: a wine with something of France\u2019s northern Rh\u00f4ne about its savoury suppleness, with fresh blackberry, black olive and a generous shake of the pepper pot. Vale D Maria Rufo Douro, Portugal 2016 (from \u00a38.50, thewinesociety.com; tanners-wines.co.uk) Cristiano van Zeller makes some of the Douro Valley\u2019s finest reds at Quinta do Vale D Maria. This is his version of a Burgundy village wine, lighter and more fruit-driven, but characteristically expressive with hints of violets, herbs and dark plums. Taste the Difference Zweigelt Austria 2017 (\u00a39, Sainsbury\u2019s) Like the equally tasteful Austrian dry white gr\u00fcner veltliner and riesling in Sainsbury\u2019s TTD range, this is made by Markus Huber, and it\u2019s just the trick for drinking chilled with grilled meat: an exuberant, light-bodied rush of black cherry. Bodega Lorca Esoterica Bonarda Uco Valley, Argentina 2018 (\u00a311.99, or \u00a38.99 as part of a mixed six, majestic.co.uk) Argentinian winemakers are really getting to grips with bonarda, using it to create light, easy-drinking wines with, as here, a kick of acidity and plum-skin tanginess that work so well slightly chilled when the thermometer rises. Domaine Joel Delaunay Touraine Gamay Loire, France 2018 (\u00a311.99, thevineking.co.uk; nywines.co.uk; oddbins.com) Gamay, generally associated with Beaujolais, is the red grape of summer, its crunchy, sappy, joyous fruity qualities on display in this succulent example from the Loire, which is full of finger-staining summer-pudding fruit. Alphabetical Vin Ordinaire Cape Red Western Cape, South Africa 2016 (from \u00a312.95, swig.co.uk; thegoodwineshop.co.uk; leaandsandeman.co.uk; laywheeler.com) A Bordeaux-style blend that is far from ordinary, but perfect for summer barbecues thanks to its freshening shading of pencil-lead and minty-herbaceous notes and abundant blackcurrant and blackberry juiciness. Vinteloper If Life Gives You Lagrein Langhourne Creek, Australia 2017 (\u00a316.99, redsquirrelwine.com) A rare Australian sighting of alpine Italian red grape variety lagrein and what fun it is: at 12.7 abv, it\u2019s made in that delicious modern wine bar \u2018vin de soif\u2019 style, but it\u2019s bursting with fresh black fruit and mouth-teasing, charcuterie-matching acidity. Le Clos du Caillou Bouquet des Garrigues C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne, France 2016 (from \u00a316.50, streetwines.co.uk; nywines.co.uk; vinvm.co.uk; jeroboams.co.uk) This aptly named red (you really do get a whiff of wild woody garrigue herbs, as well as olive, aniseed and brambly fruit) from ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-pape country is built for lamb studded with olives and roasted with rosemary on the barbecue or open-fire. Sandro Fay Costa Bassa Valtellina Superiore DOCG, Italy 2016 (from \u00a322, buonvino.co.uk; passionevino.co.uk) The grape variety of barolo and barbaresco, nebbiolo also makes beautiful wines in a lighter, prettier style further north in Lombardy\u2019s Valtellina. This is a beautiful expression: floral, raspberry-filled, fine-boned and silky-tannined. 10 summer ros\u00e9s Exquisite Collection Touraine Ros\u00e9 Loire, France 2018 (\u00a35.99, Aldi) Provence tends to get all the attention when it comes to elegant French pinks, but the ros\u00e9s of the Loire can provide the same kind of hazy, pastel-shaded pleasure, this gamay and malbec-based example is thirst quenching. Taste the Difference Fronton Negrette Ros\u00e9 Fronton, France 2018 (\u00a37, Sainsbury\u2019s) In the wine bars of Toulouse, negrette is the base of many a spicy, easy-drinking red, but it also works well as a ros\u00e9, with this dry Sainsbury\u2019s staple providing a whisper of those spicy notes in among some freshly made strawberry cordial. Contessa Cerasuolo d\u2019Abruzzo Italy 2018 (\u00a38.25, thewinesociety.com) Offering more depth (of flavour and colour) and viscous texture than your average pale and interesting modern pink, this food-friendly Italian is nonetheless dangerously easy-drinking, with plentiful soft-red cherry-berry fruit. Tesco Finest C\u00f4tes de Provence Ros\u00e9 France 2018 (\u00a38.50, Tesco) A textbook version of the patented Proven\u00e7al pink style at a very reasonable price, this has all the gentle red fruit and softly rendered citrus freshness to match summer classic dishes from salade ni\u00e7oise to garlicky grilled seafood. Le Bijou de Sophie Valrose Cabri\u00e8res, Languedoc, France 2018 (\u00a38.99, reduced to \u00a37.49, to 9 July, Waitrose) The winemakers of the Languedoc are now matching their peers down the Mediterranean coast in Provence with stylishly presented, and stylishly made, ros\u00e9s such as this, with its subtle strawberry and melon, and wash of fresh acidity. Star buy: Chapel Down English Ros\u00e9 England 2018 (\u00a312, Morrisons) English wines have never had a problem in providing crisp acidity; in generous vintages such as 2018, they can match that with delicious ripe fruit flavours. The combination, in this rosehip, cranberry and strawberry-scented ros\u00e9, is very fine indeed. Studio by Miraval Ros\u00e9 IGP Mediteranne, France 2018 (\u00a312, Co-op) The wine produced on the Brangelina-owned Miraval estate has always been better than it needed to be, and the same is true of this more affordable spin-off: it\u2019s graceful, refreshing, subtly tangy, and, naturally, comes in a very smart bottle. Judith Beck Pink Burgenland, Austria 2018 (from \u00a312.95, buonvino.co.uk; lescaves.co.uk) From a leading light in Austrian red wine, a typically lively and natural-tasting ros\u00e9. Made from a blend of Austrian local favourites zweigelt and blaufr\u00e4nkisch, it has plenty of energy and texture, with spiciness and just-tart-enough fruit. Ramon Bilbao Lalomba Rosado Rioja, Spain 2017 (\u00a323.50, greatwesternwine.co.uk) One of the best ros\u00e9s I\u2019ve tasted in a long time uses garnacha from vines grown at higher altitudes (600m above sea level) and has all the mineral finesse, fine texture and length of a fine white: delicate, long, filigree-complex, worth every penny. Domaine Tempier Bandol Ros\u00e9 Bandol, France 2018 (from \u00a325, huntsworthwine.co.uk; leaandsandeman.co.uk; wineandgreene.com; mayflywine.co.uk) You could reach for an older vintage of this unusually complex, textured, concentrated but still elegant Provence ros\u00e9: the 2016 and 2017 are both delightful. But with its citrus pithiness, peaches, and length so too, is the 2018. 10 best sparkling and fizz Aldi Cr\u00e9mant de Loire Blanc de Noir, France NV (\u00a37.99, Aldi) Aldi does well sourcing good-value French champagne-alikes. Made from 100% cabernet franc grapes this lively subtly red-berried and crisp fizz is a worthy companion to the retailer\u2019s perennial favourite, Cr\u00e9mant de Jura 2016 (\u00a38.29). Taste the Difference Pignoletto, Italy NV (\u00a38, Sainsbury\u2019s) From vineyards between Modena and Bologna, pignoletto can be a delightful alternative to prosecco, with a similar feathery lightness and sherbetty fizz plus, in this pristine example, a delightful easy-sipping mix of fresh pear, citrus and flowers. Marks &amp; Spencer Vintage Cava Spain 2015 (\u00a312, M&amp;S) In the recent rise of the sparklers, Spain\u2019s cava has been slightly left behind, but it can be brilliant value and distinctive in style, with the classic trio of local grape varieties and plenty of bottle age here bringing lipsmacking lemon and baked apple. Jansz Premium Cuv\u00e9e Tasmania, Australia NV (\u00a317.99, Waitrose, fells.co.uk) The relative cool of Tasmania is proving itself the best place for sparkling wine in the Antipodes, and Jansz has long been among the leaders on the island, with its flagship cuvee as reliably rich and full of fruit, brioche and verve as ever. Testalonga El Bandito I Wish I Was a Ninja Pet Nat Swartland, South Africa 2018 (from \u00a318.50, buonvino.co.uk; lescaves.co.uk) Pet Nat is a fashionable but actually very old method of making fizz where the wine is left to finish its fermentation in the bottle, making, in this case for a wonderfully light (9.5% abv), lithe, gentle-bubbled, subtly sweet partner for strawberries. Hunter\u2019s Miru Miru Ros\u00e9 NV Marlborough NZ (from \u00a319.50, mustwines.co.uk; jeroboams.co.uk) Very smart and swish pink fizz made from the champagne varieties pinot noir, champagne and pinot meunier with lots of fresh strawberry fruit, toastiness and creamy bubbles, and withenough weight to match with fish and veggies from the barbecue Waitrose Blanc de Noirs France NV (\u00a322.99, reduced to \u00a318.39 from 17 Jul-13 August, Waitrose) A brilliantly made 100% pinot noir champagne from one of the region\u2019s best places for the variety, the Aube, this has a weighty richness of fruit and bakery yeasty-savouriness with incisive acidity and is superb value at the offer price. Ferrari Maximum Brut Italy NV (from \u00a326.50, greatwesternwine.co.uk; harveynichols.com) No relation to the car company, precision is the watchword in Ferrari\u2019s Italian Alpine fizz, with this 100% chardonnay from vineyards up to 700m above sea-level a mineral match for many a pricier blanc de blancs champagne. Simpsons Wine Estate Chalklands Classic Cuv\u00e9e England 2016 (\u00a328, robersonwine.com) English couple Charles and Ruth Simpson earned their winemaking stripes on their estate in southern France, but this elegant fizz is a beautiful expression of one of sparkling wine\u2019s finest terroirs: the chalky soils of eastern Kent. Star buy: Champagne Drappier Brut Nature Zero Dosage France NV (from \u00a337.99, allaboutwine.co.uk; caviste.co.uk; champagneone.co.uk) Drappier make some of the cleanest, raciest, purest champagnes around, and this no-added sugar cuvee is no exception, with that scintillating house style in full refreshing effect and ready for aperitifs, oysters or a plush fish and chip dinner. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 June to reflect the fact that Valtellina is in Lombardy, not Piedmont.",

When he decided to quit Invesco and go it alone in 2013 it was a huge shock for the fund management industry. Invesco shares slumped by 7% on the day he announced his departure.</p>\n    <p>At Invesco Woodford held control of huge stakes in some of the UK\u2019s biggest firms, and his opinions mattered. His criticism of AstraZeneca chief executive David Brennan in the 2012 shareholder spring was widely regarded to have cost him his job, and his critique of BAE\u2019s attempted \u00a328bn merger with Airbus is acknowledged as one of the reasons the deal collapsed.</p>\n    <p>Woodford, who was widely referred to in the media as an investment \u201chero\u201d and fund management \u201cstar\u201d, had done exceedingly well over his quarter century there. A \u00a31,000 investment placed when he started at the firm in 1988 would have risen to \u00a323,000 by the time he left.</p>\n    <p>Woodford accidentally fell into fund management and hadn\u2019t heard of the term until he rocked up in the City in the 1980s sleeping on his brother\u2019s floor while looking for a job. He got his first break in insurance, before drifting into fund management. He had left school wanting to fly fighter jets but couldn\u2019t pass the RAF\u2019s aptitude test, and instead read economics and agricultural economics at the University of Exeter.</p>\n    <p>Feeling he had outgrown Invesco Perpetual, he set up his own firm Woodford Investment Management in 2014, on an industrial estate near Oxford. Within two weeks of launching, he had raised \u00a31.6bn, a UK record, and it quickly grew to \u00a316bn. In its first full year his flagship fund returned 16% and Woodford, a devotee of veteran US investor Warren Buffett, was dubbed the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-27/oracle-of-oxford-sees-red-as-stock-picking-powers-misfire\">\u201cOracle of Oxford\u201d</a>.</p>\n    <p>Asked if he ever doubted his judgment, Woodford once said: \u201cDaily. You must never, as a fund manager, stick your head in the sand saying \u2018everybody go away, I\u2019m right, I\u2019m right, I\u2019m right\u2019. You\u2019ve always got to expose yourself to criticism and the analysis that you may be wrong.\u201d</p>\n    <p>Woodford went on to say that the secret of successful fund management was a balance of arrogance and humility. \u201cYou have to have a sufficiently strong arrogant gene to back your judgment, back your conviction. If you didn\u2019t, you would end up with a portfolio that looks very much like the index. But, equally, you must have the humility to accept that you will get things wrong.\u201d</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rupertneate\"><b>Rupert Neate</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Jason Hollands, a managing director at Tilney Investment Management, said: \u201cThe trust is clearly experiencing significant selling pressure, on the back of the reputational hit to the manager, and because it has cross holdings in a number of businesses in common with the suspended fund which the latter needs to sell.\u201d</p> \n<p>The last snapshot of the trust\u2019s top 10 holdings included digital lender Atom Bank, a cold fusion nuclear energy firm called Industrial Heat, and artificial intelligence business Benevolent AI.</p> \n<p>While Hollands said the council pension fund holdings in Woodford are relatively small given the typical size of local authority retirement schemes, they are at risk of a loss on investment if shares end up being sold before the price recovers.</p> \n<p>The Dyfed Pension Fund, which manages the pension benefits for Carmarthenshire, Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion county councils, holds a \u00a32.4m stake in Woodford\u2019s listed fund.

      "bodyText": "Council workers have been left exposed to the underperformance of Neil Woodford\u2019s stock market-listed fund, with a \u00a310m investment by council pension schemes at risk from the fund\u2019s declining share price. Shares in the Woodford Patient Capital Trust Fund have tumbled 25% to 58p since 3 June, when Woodford made the shock decision to suspend his flagship Equity Income Fund, following a surge in redemptions sparked by bad market bets. While the FTSE 250-listed fund is not directly affected by the suspension, the move at its sister fund caused a sell off in shares and the value of shareholder investments to decline. At least three local authority pension funds, including Derbyshire, West Yorkshire and Dyfed in Wales, have investments tied up in Woodford\u2019s patient capital fund and risk seeing their investments fall further as the stock price continues to slide. Those pensions investments help fund retirement benefits for members including local government employees, councillors, school teachers, charities and housing association staff. Concerns over public investments in Woodford\u2019s fund first came into focus when Kent County Council was blocked from pulling \u00a3263m from his equity income fund at the end of May. It is believed that the local authority\u2019s request prompted Woodford to suspend the fund. Joel Benjamin, a member of Research for Action, which investigates public finances, said the episode raised questions over whether councils should be trusted to make large, risky investments. \u201cLocal authorities have a dubious record investing money on our behalf, with \u00a31bn losses in Iceland\u2019s banks in 2008 still fresh in people\u2019s minds,\u201d he said. The \u00a314.3bn West Yorkshire Pension Fund confirmed it holds a \u00a33.5m stake in the listed vehicle, but stressed its investments are reviewed on a regular basis. It refused to comment further on its patient capital trust holdings and confirmed it never held shares in Woodford\u2019s suspended equity income fund. Meanwhile, the rapid fall in Woodford\u2019s share price has left Derbyshire\u2019s pension fund \u00a3800,000 worse off. Derbyshire\u2019s pension scheme, which is worth \u00a35bn and has 100,000 members, holds 5m shares in Woodford\u2019s funds as part of its private equity portfolio. That investment is now worth \u00a33m compared with \u00a33.8m at the start of June. Jason Hollands, a managing director at Tilney Investment Management, said: \u201cThe trust is clearly experiencing significant selling pressure, on the back of the reputational hit to the manager, and because it has cross holdings in a number of businesses in common with the suspended fund which the latter needs to sell.\u201d The last snapshot of the trust\u2019s top 10 holdings included digital lender Atom Bank, a cold fusion nuclear energy firm called Industrial Heat, and artificial intelligence business Benevolent AI. While Hollands said the council pension fund holdings in Woodford are relatively small given the typical size of local authority retirement schemes, they are at risk of a loss on investment if shares end up being sold before the price recovers. The Dyfed Pension Fund, which manages the pension benefits for Carmarthenshire, Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion county councils, holds a \u00a32.4m stake in Woodford\u2019s listed fund. It accounts for 0.1% of its total \u00a32.4bn pension scheme. \u201cWe have nothing invested in the Equity Income fund,\u201d a Carmarthenshire spokeswoman said on behalf of the Dyfed Pension Fund. \u201cWe cannot comment further on future plans at this time.\u201d Woodford Patient Capital Trust declined to comment on the pension scheme holdings and share price decline.

When the game finished, I just said to him, \u2018Congrats, well done\u2019. And Nick gets back to me with a message that reads, \u2018Thanks, Nigel, it feels exactly like \u201896\u2019\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/14/toronto-raptors-nba-championship-finals-golden-state-warriors\">In the era of player power, the Raptors' NBA dynasty may be over before it begins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After guiding the Toronto Raptors to a historic 4-2 series win over the heavily-fancied Golden State Warriors in the NBA finals \u2013 ensuring a first-ever championship for the Canadian team \u2013 Nurse walked into the post-game press conference and discussed his unlikely rise, with a specific nod to his long stint in the UK.</p> <p>\u201cAll those jobs meant the world to me at the time,\u201d he said, referring to a coaching career that began with the Derby Rams in 1990 and continued through stints in London, Manchester and Brighton before he returned to his native US and tasted success in the NBA minor leagues.</p> <p>\u201cI loved all of them. Whether it was winning with Birmingham or with Rio Grande Valley. I never really got discouraged. I didn\u2019t really care about the level I was coaching at. I just wanted to learn and get better.\u201d</p> <p>He arrived in the East Midlands a lifetime ago, hired by Derby owner Tim Rudge as a player-coach. Nurse had just finished a scholarship at the University of Northern Iowa, where he had built a solid reputation on and off the court. He had served as an assistant to Eldon Miller and although the NBA was never an option, he still felt there were some playing opportunities further afield. He sent his CV to various teams around the globe but heard nothing. Then Rudge called, offered him a dual role and Nurse made his BBL debut five days later.</p> <p>\u201cHe was in his early 20s but looked about 16 or 17 and was quite scrawny\u201d says Martin Ford, who was part of that Derby team. \u201cAnd he was pedantic. It was all about precision. \u2018You sprint down the floor and you stand at this point because this is the optimum place you need to be to start our offense\u2019. Now, that point was about half a square meter. So, the biggest thing I took from him was the pinpoint positioning of players.\u201d</p> <p>The team travelled to games in a white van. It was customary for the coach to drive but Nurse wasn\u2019t old enough to take the wheel of a rental so Ford, the starting center, stepped up instead.</p> <p>\u201cA couple of times it broke down on the M1, driving back from Thames Valley and Crystal Palace,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI tried to cradle it to the service area but didn\u2019t manage it so we had to offload on the motorway and wait for assistance. A slight difference to what Nick is used to now.\u201d</p> <p>Nurse used the unconventional travel experience to his advantage. It allowed him to build relationships, namely with Ford. And that led to trust and the players committing fully to what their coach wanted.</p> <p>\u201cHe was my co-driver,\u201d Ford says. \u201cHe\u2019d sit in the front and we\u2019d chat. He was interested in you as a person. He wanted to know about my work, my family. That keeps you grounded as an individual but it also allows you to almost demand more from other people. I remember one game and it was tight. I\u2019d got injured, rolled my ankle or something. He took a timeout, came up to me and said, \u2018I need you out there. I know you\u2019re hurt but there are young lads here who don\u2019t have the experience so you\u2019ve got to come out and give me everything you have to try and help us win this game now.\u2019 Because he\u2019d got to know me and because he\u2019d allowed us to get to know him, we understood that desire to win. He created that within us. So I was quite happy to get back out there.\u201d</p> <p>Kevin Routledge, chairman of the BBL during much of Nurse\u2019s time there, also noticed Nurse\u2019s talent. \u201cThe players knew he was for them,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd they were going to go the extra mile. It\u2019s not about how much they get paid or the training facilities. Ultimately, it\u2019s about how much they buy into a coaching philosophy. It\u2019s a completely different circumstance Nick is in now but it\u2019s still about getting five guys out there, playing for each other.\u201d</p> <p>Since taking charge of the Raptors last summer, Nurse has frequently mentioned the one season he spent in Birmingham. You can understand why. While there, he first bumped into Masai Ujiri, a journeyman player, then lining out for Derby. Decades later, Ujiri \u2013 born in Bournemouth but raised in Nigeria \u2013 would become Raptors general manager and hire Nurse to replace Dwayne Casey as head coach.</p> <p>When Ujiri followed up that appointment by signing superstar Kawhi Leonard, Nurse claimed the last player he coached of that calibre was Tony Dorsey, a key member of the Bullets team. </p> <p>\u201cDorsey was the unstoppable force, like Kawhi,\u201d says Lloyd, who Nurse compared to Kyle Lowry.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a lot of similarities. Nick references that period all the time. He doesn\u2019t have to say it was like \u201896. He\u2019s won other championships. But 1996 was the first final, the first time he put a team together, when he figured out the way he wanted to coach and try out a lot of new things. Like the Raptors, we ran into the top team \u2013 London Towers, who\u2019d won everything. We weren\u2019t supposed to beat them but we ended up doing it at Wembley. </p> <p>\u201cI remember our last practice before we headed to London and it was one of the calmest practices we ever had. Whatever he said to do, we all did it. Similar to how Toronto were this year. No emotion, everyone knew what they had to do, the goals they had to accomplish ... he had us so prepared going into that weekend. You looked around and everyone was focused. It was a special feeling. It just felt different.\u201d</p> <p>Nurse won another championship with Manchester Giants in 2000 and was twice voted Coach of the Year. During his final spell in the UK with Brighton Bears, he ended up as head coach, general manager and owner. Memorably, three days after his eviction from the Celebrity Big Brother house, five-time NBA champion Dennis Rodman played for Nurse against the Guildford Heat and stuck around for two more games.</p> <p>\u201cThat was him thinking outside the box,\u201d Routledge says. \u201cHe saw the opportunity and had the audacity to pull it off. It was great publicity, it wasn\u2019t going to win him the league title but it was something he will have learned from. And that was the thing that always struck me about Nick: constantly learning and testing things out to see if they could work.\u201d</p>",

Then Rudge called, offered him a dual role and Nurse made his BBL debut five days later. \u201cHe was in his early 20s but looked about 16 or 17 and was quite scrawny\u201d says Martin Ford, who was part of that Derby team. \u201cAnd he was pedantic. It was all about precision. \u2018You sprint down the floor and you stand at this point because this is the optimum place you need to be to start our offense\u2019. Now, that point was about half a square meter. So, the biggest thing I took from him was the pinpoint positioning of players.\u201d The team travelled to games in a white van. It was customary for the coach to drive but Nurse wasn\u2019t old enough to take the wheel of a rental so Ford, the starting center, stepped up instead. \u201cA couple of times it broke down on the M1, driving back from Thames Valley and Crystal Palace,\u201d he remembers. \u201cI tried to cradle it to the service area but didn\u2019t manage it so we had to offload on the motorway and wait for assistance. A slight difference to what Nick is used to now.\u201d Nurse used the unconventional travel experience to his advantage. It allowed him to build relationships, namely with Ford. And that led to trust and the players committing fully to what their coach wanted. \u201cHe was my co-driver,\u201d Ford says. \u201cHe\u2019d sit in the front and we\u2019d chat. He was interested in you as a person. He wanted to know about my work, my family. That keeps you grounded as an individual but it also allows you to almost demand more from other people. I remember one game and it was tight. I\u2019d got injured, rolled my ankle or something. He took a timeout, came up to me and said, \u2018I need you out there. I know you\u2019re hurt but there are young lads here who don\u2019t have the experience so you\u2019ve got to come out and give me everything you have to try and help us win this game now.\u2019 Because he\u2019d got to know me and because he\u2019d allowed us to get to know him, we understood that desire to win. He created that within us. So I was quite happy to get back out there.\u201d Kevin Routledge, chairman of the BBL during much of Nurse\u2019s time there, also noticed Nurse\u2019s talent. \u201cThe players knew he was for them,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd they were going to go the extra mile. It\u2019s not about how much they get paid or the training facilities. Ultimately, it\u2019s about how much they buy into a coaching philosophy. It\u2019s a completely different circumstance Nick is in now but it\u2019s still about getting five guys out there, playing for each other.\u201d Since taking charge of the Raptors last summer, Nurse has frequently mentioned the one season he spent in Birmingham. You can understand why. While there, he first bumped into Masai Ujiri, a journeyman player, then lining out for Derby. Decades later, Ujiri \u2013 born in Bournemouth but raised in Nigeria \u2013 would become Raptors general manager and hire Nurse to replace Dwayne Casey as head coach. When Ujiri followed up that appointment by signing superstar Kawhi Leonard, Nurse claimed the last player he coached of that calibre was Tony Dorsey, a key member of the Bullets team. \u201cDorsey was the unstoppable force, like Kawhi,\u201d says Lloyd, who Nurse compared to Kyle Lowry. \u201cThere are a lot of similarities. Nick references that period all the time. He doesn\u2019t have to say it was like \u201896. He\u2019s won other championships. But 1996 was the first final, the first time he put a team together, when he figured out the way he wanted to coach and try out a lot of new things. Like the Raptors, we ran into the top team \u2013 London Towers, who\u2019d won everything. We weren\u2019t supposed to beat them but we ended up doing it at Wembley. \u201cI remember our last practice before we headed to London and it was one of the calmest practices we ever had. Whatever he said to do, we all did it. Similar to how Toronto were this year. No emotion, everyone knew what they had to do, the goals they had to accomplish ... he had us so prepared going into that weekend. You looked around and everyone was focused. It was a special feeling. It just felt different.\u201d Nurse won another championship with Manchester Giants in 2000 and was twice voted Coach of the Year. During his final spell in the UK with Brighton Bears, he ended up as head coach, general manager and owner. Memorably, three days after his eviction from the Celebrity Big Brother house, five-time NBA champion Dennis Rodman played for Nurse against the Guildford Heat and stuck around for two more games. \u201cThat was him thinking outside the box,\u201d Routledge says. \u201cHe saw the opportunity and had the audacity to pull it off. It was great publicity, it wasn\u2019t going to win him the league title but it was something he will have learned from. And that was the thing that always struck me about Nick: constantly learning and testing things out to see if they could work.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>I spend as much of the summer as possible in Sperlonga, which is to say not all that much. Would that I had my grandmother Ginny\u2019s work ethic. She spent most of her time there, doing little and living larger.</p> <p>My grandparents moved to Italy in 1952, seeking a rest cure for Ginny\u2019s recurrent tuberculosis. My grandfather John was a writer and gallerist, my grandmother a Broadway and Hollywood <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/virginia-campbell-ck03f220z\" title=\"\">starlet and painter</a>. Arriving in Rome they found themselves surrounded by friends old and new. It is incredible to hear my mum recall their names \u2013 Ginny died not so long ago \u2013 but suffice to say that Fellini\u2019s <em>La Dolce Vita</em> was inspired by Ginny and Grandpa, and specifically a party they threw. They are Steiner and his wife in the film, and Ginny\u2019s paintings adorn the walls of the infamous party scene, her guests Fellini\u2019s extras.</p> <p>That scene was their life in Rome and, for sanity, a regular antidote was essential. They bought an apartment in an isolated fishing village, Sperlonga, a couple of hours to the south. We still own it, but the town is no longer remote: connected by the Via Flacca, it is now a mecca for Roman and Neapolitan youth in the summer.</p> <p>The evening fish market in Gaeta(the town where Ginny, fresh from a plumbing course she took God-knows-why, repaired her friend Gore Vidal\u2019s toilet), butchers (little hole-in-the-walls on Gaeta\u2019s Via dell\u2019Indipendenza or the carnal temple that is Scherzerino in Itri) and greengrocers (none better than Poco Poco in Sperlonga) have produce that cries out to be cooked \u2013 simply \u2013 and eaten. This is the swamp Mussolini drained, leaving the most fertile land in Italy for tomatoes, courgettes, aubergines, melons, figs and peaches. This is the sea of grey mullet and gurnard, pink bream, black cuttlefish and red prawns. It is the sea Odysseus sailed \u2013 my balcony overlooks the false island, Circeo, thought to be Aeaea, where the goddess Circe turned Odysseus\u2019s crew to pigs. It is the sea of my childhood, which I cannot return to often enough.</p> <h2>APERITIVO</h2> <h2>White wine and peach punch</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b0646a7eb153a167cbf4880ef541a31a5d39404\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b0646a7eb153a167cbf4880ef541a31a5d39404/0_142_6192_6192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"White wine & peach punch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In Italy it is not uncommon to steep a peach in wine. It\u2019s not entirely obvious whether this is for the benefit of the peach or the vino but both seem to like it. </p> <p><em><strong>Makes </strong></em><em><strong>enough for 1</strong></em><br><strong>fresh ripe peach</strong> \u00bd, cut into segments (skin on, unless it bothers you)<br><strong>white wine</strong> \u00bd a bottle <br><strong>mint or basil</strong> a sprig (optional) <br><strong>ice</strong><br><strong>soda water</strong> (optional)</p> <p>Steep the peach in the wine for at least half an hour, but up to half a day, in the fridge. Serve it over ice, with the mint or basil submerged if you fancy it, and top with a mere splash of soda water.</p> <p>Italian Pimms. Drink the wine, then fish the peach from your glass and eat that too.</p> <h2>Olives, walnuts and rosemary</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c9860dc09f91cd4075ef910d4921ebfdda61b1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c9860dc09f91cd4075ef910d4921ebfdda61b1a/0_218_6192_6192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Olives, walnuts &amp; rosemary\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Aperitivo time is a time to nibble. Very crunchy salted crisps, peanuts and taralli, Italy\u2019s answer to the pretzel, are the norm, as are a few slices of pecorino and dried local sausage. Olives are on the table, too. Mixed with walnuts and rosemary, they make for a surprisingly complete moment on their own, or alongside a glass of something cold and fizzy.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves 4</strong></em><br><strong>stone-in olives</strong> 150g (look for gaeta or cerignola)<br><strong>walnuts</strong> 75g, lightly candied, lightly roasted or raw<br><strong>rosemary </strong>1 good sprig, leaves picked<br><strong>lemon </strong>1 wedge, cut into very small fragments<br><strong>extra virgin olive oil </strong>2 tbsp</p> <p>Toss everything together. Eat alongside your drinks.</p> <h2>ANTIPASTO</h2> <h2>Aubergines \u2018a funghetto\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e611afb6ac9614ece31337b1b7d6ba5ec6fa733e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e611afb6ac9614ece31337b1b7d6ba5ec6fa733e/0_1709_6192_6192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aubergines \u2018a funghetto\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>A wonderful woman, Leontina, helped Ginny look after my mother when she was a baby. She helped my mum with me when I was tiny, then did the same when my sister was born 10 years later. A few years ago, when she was still well enough to travel, Leontina came down from the convent to which she had retired and met us all in Rome. We drove with her to Sperlonga and she made two things I remember particularly well. She made a magnificent tomato sauce (see note below), and she did something fiendish with aubergines. Later, I discovered these were aubergines \u2018a funghetto\u2019 \u2013 cooked as one might cook mushrooms.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves 4</strong></em><em><strong> or more as an antipasto or side</strong></em><br><strong>aubergines</strong> 1kg (violet are best), cut in 2cm chunks<br><strong>extra virgin olive oil</strong> 80ml <br><strong>ripe plum or San Marzano tomatoes</strong> 600g, cut in 2cm chunks<br><strong>garlic</strong> 2 cloves, halved<br><strong>basil</strong> 12 leaves, torn</p> <p>Heat a non-stick or well seasoned, very wide pan over a high heat. Add the aubergines and half the oil at the same time. Stir occasionally until just starting to brown (10-15 minutes).</p> <p>Push the aubergines to one side. Add the tomatoes, garlic and remaining oil and fry for a couple of minutes. Lower the heat right down, stir everything together and add generous salt plus a little pepper. Make sure to cook in a single layer and stir very occasionally \u2013 every 5 minutes or so \u2013 or rather, gently turn in the pan. Cook like this for a good hour, or even more, until the tomatoes and aubergines are largely intact yet meltingly tender, all the liquid evaporated. Take off the heat. While still hot, stir in the basil, then let the dish cool to room temperature. Serve with firm brown bread or toasted white bread as an antipasto, a snack or a side.</p> <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The way Leontina made her tomato sauce was almost brutal in its simplicity. She took perhaps a kilo of tomatoes (good, ripe ones \u2013 halved, keeping seeds, skins and all), a finger of oil, a small onion (halved), and I think some whole garlic cloves. Everything was raw. She set the pot to simmer for half an hour with salt and pepper (or chilli), then blended the lot. It was one of the most delicious sauces I have ever tasted.</p> <h2>Saut\u00e9 of clams and mussels</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13a91393df26c2338eb44c2c2bbdf06d683028be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13a91393df26c2338eb44c2c2bbdf06d683028be/0_917_4000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Saut\u00e9 of clams &amp; mussels\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Some foods are the subject of much debate in their hometown, especially if that hometown is in Italy. What to argue about in a saut\u00e9 of shellfish? How much oil? Chilli? Tomato? Wine? Parsley? What is the best tasting bivalve? </p> <p>You might have a preference for clams or mussels, so use one or the other (double the quantity in the recipe below). You may prefer the dish without the tomato or with regulation parsley added instead of my heretical basil, or with fresh chilli or the conventional splash of wine. Cook it your way, and it\u2019ll come out just fine.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves 4 as a starter</strong></em><br><strong>live clams</strong> 750g <br><strong>live mussels</strong> 750g <br><strong>extra virgin olive oil</strong> 6 tbsp <br><strong>garlic</strong> 2 cloves, thinly sliced<br><strong>crushed dried chilli flakes</strong> 1 pinch <br><strong>cherry tomatoes</strong> 6, quartered, or 1 regular one in 1cm dice<br><strong>basil</strong> 8 leaves</p> <p>Sort through the clams and discard any with broken or empty shells, or open ones which refuse to close when tapped on the table. Beard the mussels, discarding any with broken or empty shells or open ones which refuse to close when tapped on the table.</p> <p>Heat a big, wide, heavy pan over a high heat. At the same time, add the clams, half the oil, the garlic and the chilli. Cook, with the lid on, for 1 minute.</p> <p>Add the mussels and tomatoes, and some black pepper if you fancy. Cook, with the lid on, for 2-3 minutes, shaking the pan every so often.</p> <p>Peek under the lid. When about half the shellfish have opened, start picking out the fully open ones and place them in a serving bowl. Keep the rest cooking, removing the opened ones to the serving bowl until the very last has opened (or has refused to, in which case, discard it).</p> <p>Tear the basil leaves and stir into the sauce with the remaining olive oil. Pour this sauce over the bowlful of cooked clams and mussels.</p> <p>Serve with crusty bread.</p> <p><strong>NOTE: </strong>To turn this into a primo (starch course), boil 500g dried spaghetti or spaghettini until al dente, and toss it in with the cooked shellfish and their juices just before serving.</p> <h2>PRIMO</h2> <h2>Rigatoni with ricotta and guanciale</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2eefd0130ce94b02caf915a25c3917fa67e30c30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2eefd0130ce94b02caf915a25c3917fa67e30c30/0_622_6192_6192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rigatoni with ricotta & guanciale\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It is worth seeking out fresh ricotta if you can; an Italian deli in the UK might have it, or get some if you go on holiday to Italy. Seek out sheep\u2019s milk for the best flavour \u2013 they make it in the Dolomites, Sardinia and southern Italy.</p> <p>This recipe is one I made up in Sperlonga, where we normally eat ricotta every day. For breakfast or lunch, or dinner\u2019s antipasto, room temperature with oil and rocket and bread; stuffed into courgette flowers; baked into a dessert or whipped with sugar and served with strawberries. Or in pasta.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves 4</strong></em><br><strong>rigatoni</strong> 400g (or penne rigati or tortiglioni)<br><strong>ricotta</strong> 250g, preferably sheep\u2019s milk<br><strong>freshly ground black pepper</strong> 1 full tsp <br><strong>parmesan or </strong><strong>pecorino romano</strong> 100g, grated <br><strong>guanciale</strong> 150g, cut into 5mm lardons, or pancetta cut the same way (for pancetta, which is less fatty, add also 2 tbsp olive oil</p> <p>Have ready a large pan of boiling, well-salted water, 10-12g salt per litre. Put the pasta on to boil.</p> <p>In a large bowl, whisk together the ricotta, pepper and half the grated cheese with a ladleful of the pasta water, until it\u2019s the texture of thick cream. Settle this bowl on the pasta pot, like a lid, to warm it.</p> <p>In a wide frying pan over a high heat, fry the guanciale (no oil \u2013 it has enough fat of its own) for 3-5 minutes, until it\u2019s crispy outside but still juicy within.</p> <p>When cooked, but al dente, drain the pasta and reserve a bowlful of its water. Toss the pasta in the guanciale and its cooking fat.</p> <p>Add the lot to the warmed ricotta mixture, stir to coat, and add a little more water if it gets claggy. Serve with the remaining grated cheese on top.</p> <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Guanciale is cured pig\u2019s cheek and jowl, like an \u00fcber-bacon, which is very fatty and piggy and spesh. For a vegetarian version of this dish, at least as flavoursome, omit it (and omit steps 4 and 6) and instead whisk into the ricotta 8 basil leaves (chopped), grated zest of 1 lemon, \u215b of a nutmeg (grated), and 3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil.</p> <h2>SECONDO</h2> <h2>Baked bream with tomatoes, olives and rosemary</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73703e7ca02f967a2505a19bea41d9c7e287986b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73703e7ca02f967a2505a19bea41d9c7e287986b/0_1032_6192_6192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Baked bream with tomatoes, olives &amp; rosemary\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Bream is a lovely, clean, white-fleshed fish. You can use any smallish white fish \u2013 bass or snapper or gurnard \u2013 whatever is freshest and most appealing. Beautiful fish should not be messed with. </p> <p><em><strong>Serves 4</strong></em><br><strong>whole fish</strong> 1.5kg, very fresh, scaled and gutted (any number of fish but keep them whole)<br><strong>sea salt</strong> 25g <br><strong>baby plum tomatoes</strong> 800g, datterino are best, halved<br><strong>extra virgin olive oil</strong> 5 tbsp <br><strong>black olives </strong>100g, stone-in and drained (gaeta if possible, otherwise kalamata or similar)<br><strong>rosemary</strong> 2 sprigs <br><strong>white wine</strong> 2 tbsp</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6.</p> <p>An hour or two before cooking, take the fish from the fridge. Inspect it for tenacious scales and rinse the belly. Rub it inside and out with half the salt. Let it come to room temperature.</p> <p>An hour or so (or more) before you plan to eat, toss the tomatoes with 4 tablespoons of the oil, spread them on a wide oven tray and bake for 25 minutes until condensed \u2013 you can do this ahead if you like.</p> <p>Take the tomatoes from the oven and scatter with the olives and rosemary. Lay the fish on top. Sprinkle with the wine and the remaining salt.</p> <p>Bake the fish \u2013 one 1-1.5kg beast will take 40 minutes (ish), roughly 750g fishes will take 30 minutes, and 400-600g specimens about 20 minutes.</p> <p>Test for doneness. You can use a food thermometer \u2013 you want an internal temperature of 55C \u2013 or test by gently pressing the fish with a finger; springy is underdone, just giving is perfect, firm or mushy is overdone. (Meaty fish goes firm, delicate fish goes mushy.) Or you can lift open the belly cavity with the tip of a knife and see if the flesh will \u2013 just \u2013 separate from the spine. Drizzle with the remaining oil and serve.</p> <h2>Pan-fried greens</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5ff4eac70d7da5faa3893c6eecd06ed06695f06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5ff4eac70d7da5faa3893c6eecd06ed06695f06/0_425_4000_4733/845.jpg\" alt=\"Greens\" width=\"845\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>If one thing gives me the greatest joy to eat it\u2019s a plate of properly cooked, totally tender, still vibrant and verdant greens. There are only two ways to serve them. Either boiled properly in plenty of well-salted water, refreshed and squeezed dry, then served room temperature with lemon and good olive oil. Or, as here, pan-fried with garlic and chilli.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves 4 </strong></em><br><strong>greens</strong> 1kg, cicoria (bitter green chicory), spinach, fine-stemmed chard or escarole <br><strong>extra virgin olive oil</strong> 4 tbsp <br><strong>garlic</strong> 1 large clove, thinly sliced<br><strong>crushed dried chilli</strong> 1 pinch</p> <p>Prepare the greens and wash them thoroughly. Cut them into large (10cm) pieces. Put a large pan of very well-salted water on to boil (as for pasta, 12g salt per litre).</p> <p>Boil the greens until they just lose any hint of crunch, so they are tender but still green. Drain, refresh in a colander under running water, and squeeze dry.</p> <p>Heat a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the oil and garlic at the same time. Fry until some of the garlic just begins to brown at the edges. Add the chilli, then straightaway the boiled greens.</p> <p>Reduce the heat to low and pan-fry, stirring, for 10 minutes or so until you are satisfied with the flavour.</p> <h2>Salad with lemon dressing</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0f845d28190021efb2835e3242b1efac4f714dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0f845d28190021efb2835e3242b1efac4f714dc/0_378_6192_6192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Salad\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>My wonderful mum makes wonderful salad. It is lemony and refreshing and simple. She sometimes serves it as we sit down, sometimes with the main, sometimes after, but it is always our favourite part of the meal.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves 4</strong></em><br><strong>lemon</strong> 1 large and very juicy <br><strong>garlic</strong> 1 clove <br><strong>very good extra virgin olive oil</strong> 5 tbsp <br><strong>salt</strong> 1 tsp <br><strong>freshly ground pepper</strong> \u00bc tsp <br><strong>lettuce</strong> 1 large and very beautiful \u2013 round lettuce, romano (cos/romaine) or escarole</p> <p>Zest the lemon \u2013 use a potato peeler for a delicate dressing or a grater for a punchier one. Squeeze the lemon juice and crush the garlic.</p> <p>Stir together the lemon zest and juice, garlic, oil and seasoning.</p> <p>Wash the lettuce and spin it properly dry. Dress it and serve immediately.</p> <h2>PUDDING</h2> <h2>Double torta caprese</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ecaadc38396d1aed64794ffc8760ade98e35481\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ecaadc38396d1aed64794ffc8760ade98e35481/0_520_6192_6192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Double Torta Caprese\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Capri is an ancient island of two halves, Capri and Anacapri. There are two types of visitor to the island: the raucous daytripping tourist and the vulgar bejewelled billionaire. There are two Capresi dishes: the caprese salad (tomato, mozzarella, basil) and the caprese cake (almond cake). And there are two caprese cakes: lemon and chocolate. Both sides of the island are beautiful, both visitors make for extremely entertaining people-watching, both Capresi dishes are delicious and both cakes are irresistible.</p> <p>Trying to have the best of both worlds, I make a torta caprese in two layers, dark and light. The lemon and chocolate cakes, united by almond, go beautifully together.

Add the chocolate and almond mixture. Start to stir \u2013 the mixture will be so thick it won\u2019t come together, so add the melted butter to help it along.

      "bodyText": "I spend as much of the summer as possible in Sperlonga, which is to say not all that much. Would that I had my grandmother Ginny\u2019s work ethic. She spent most of her time there, doing little and living larger. My grandparents moved to Italy in 1952, seeking a rest cure for Ginny\u2019s recurrent tuberculosis. My grandfather John was a writer and gallerist, my grandmother a Broadway and Hollywood starlet and painter. Arriving in Rome they found themselves surrounded by friends old and new. It is incredible to hear my mum recall their names \u2013 Ginny died not so long ago \u2013 but suffice to say that Fellini\u2019s La Dolce Vita was inspired by Ginny and Grandpa, and specifically a party they threw. They are Steiner and his wife in the film, and Ginny\u2019s paintings adorn the walls of the infamous party scene, her guests Fellini\u2019s extras. That scene was their life in Rome and, for sanity, a regular antidote was essential. They bought an apartment in an isolated fishing village, Sperlonga, a couple of hours to the south. We still own it, but the town is no longer remote: connected by the Via Flacca, it is now a mecca for Roman and Neapolitan youth in the summer. The evening fish market in Gaeta(the town where Ginny, fresh from a plumbing course she took God-knows-why, repaired her friend Gore Vidal\u2019s toilet), butchers (little hole-in-the-walls on Gaeta\u2019s Via dell\u2019Indipendenza or the carnal temple that is Scherzerino in Itri) and greengrocers (none better than Poco Poco in Sperlonga) have produce that cries out to be cooked \u2013 simply \u2013 and eaten. This is the swamp Mussolini drained, leaving the most fertile land in Italy for tomatoes, courgettes, aubergines, melons, figs and peaches. This is the sea of grey mullet and gurnard, pink bream, black cuttlefish and red prawns. It is the sea Odysseus sailed \u2013 my balcony overlooks the false island, Circeo, thought to be Aeaea, where the goddess Circe turned Odysseus\u2019s crew to pigs. It is the sea of my childhood, which I cannot return to often enough. APERITIVO White wine and peach punch In Italy it is not uncommon to steep a peach in wine. It\u2019s not entirely obvious whether this is for the benefit of the peach or the vino but both seem to like it. Makes enough for 1 fresh ripe peach \u00bd, cut into segments (skin on, unless it bothers you) white wine \u00bd a bottle mint or basil a sprig (optional) ice soda water (optional) Steep the peach in the wine for at least half an hour, but up to half a day, in the fridge. Serve it over ice, with the mint or basil submerged if you fancy it, and top with a mere splash of soda water. Italian Pimms. Drink the wine, then fish the peach from your glass and eat that too. Olives, walnuts and rosemary Aperitivo time is a time to nibble. Very crunchy salted crisps, peanuts and taralli, Italy\u2019s answer to the pretzel, are the norm, as are a few slices of pecorino and dried local sausage. Olives are on the table, too. Mixed with walnuts and rosemary, they make for a surprisingly complete moment on their own, or alongside a glass of something cold and fizzy. Serves 4 stone-in olives 150g (look for gaeta or cerignola) walnuts 75g, lightly candied, lightly roasted or raw rosemary 1 good sprig, leaves picked lemon 1 wedge, cut into very small fragments extra virgin olive oil 2 tbsp Toss everything together. Eat alongside your drinks. ANTIPASTO Aubergines \u2018a funghetto\u2019 A wonderful woman, Leontina, helped Ginny look after my mother when she was a baby. She helped my mum with me when I was tiny, then did the same when my sister was born 10 years later. A few years ago, when she was still well enough to travel, Leontina came down from the convent to which she had retired and met us all in Rome. We drove with her to Sperlonga and she made two things I remember particularly well. She made a magnificent tomato sauce (see note below), and she did something fiendish with aubergines. Later, I discovered these were aubergines \u2018a funghetto\u2019 \u2013 cooked as one might cook mushrooms. Serves 4 or more as an antipasto or side aubergines 1kg (violet are best), cut in 2cm chunks extra virgin olive oil 80ml ripe plum or San Marzano tomatoes 600g, cut in 2cm chunks garlic 2 cloves, halved basil 12 leaves, torn Heat a non-stick or well seasoned, very wide pan over a high heat. Add the aubergines and half the oil at the same time. Stir occasionally until just starting to brown (10-15 minutes). Push the aubergines to one side. Add the tomatoes, garlic and remaining oil and fry for a couple of minutes. Lower the heat right down, stir everything together and add generous salt plus a little pepper. Make sure to cook in a single layer and stir very occasionally \u2013 every 5 minutes or so \u2013 or rather, gently turn in the pan. Cook like this for a good hour, or even more, until the tomatoes and aubergines are largely intact yet meltingly tender, all the liquid evaporated. Take off the heat. While still hot, stir in the basil, then let the dish cool to room temperature. Serve with firm brown bread or toasted white bread as an antipasto, a snack or a side. NOTE: The way Leontina made her tomato sauce was almost brutal in its simplicity. She took perhaps a kilo of tomatoes (good, ripe ones \u2013 halved, keeping seeds, skins and all), a finger of oil, a small onion (halved), and I think some whole garlic cloves. Everything was raw. She set the pot to simmer for half an hour with salt and pepper (or chilli), then blended the lot. It was one of the most delicious sauces I have ever tasted. Saut\u00e9 of clams and mussels Some foods are the subject of much debate in their hometown, especially if that hometown is in Italy. What to argue about in a saut\u00e9 of shellfish? How much oil? Chilli? Tomato? Wine? Parsley? What is the best tasting bivalve? You might have a preference for clams or mussels, so use one or the other (double the quantity in the recipe below). You may prefer the dish without the tomato or with regulation parsley added instead of my heretical basil, or with fresh chilli or the conventional splash of wine. Cook it your way, and it\u2019ll come out just fine. Serves 4 as a starter live clams 750g live mussels 750g extra virgin olive oil 6 tbsp garlic 2 cloves, thinly sliced crushed dried chilli flakes 1 pinch cherry tomatoes 6, quartered, or 1 regular one in 1cm dice basil 8 leaves Sort through the clams and discard any with broken or empty shells, or open ones which refuse to close when tapped on the table. Beard the mussels, discarding any with broken or empty shells or open ones which refuse to close when tapped on the table. Heat a big, wide, heavy pan over a high heat. At the same time, add the clams, half the oil, the garlic and the chilli. Cook, with the lid on, for 1 minute. Add the mussels and tomatoes, and some black pepper if you fancy. Cook, with the lid on, for 2-3 minutes, shaking the pan every so often. Peek under the lid. When about half the shellfish have opened, start picking out the fully open ones and place them in a serving bowl. Keep the rest cooking, removing the opened ones to the serving bowl until the very last has opened (or has refused to, in which case, discard it). Tear the basil leaves and stir into the sauce with the remaining olive oil. Pour this sauce over the bowlful of cooked clams and mussels. Serve with crusty bread. NOTE: To turn this into a primo (starch course), boil 500g dried spaghetti or spaghettini until al dente, and toss it in with the cooked shellfish and their juices just before serving. PRIMO Rigatoni with ricotta and guanciale It is worth seeking out fresh ricotta if you can; an Italian deli in the UK might have it, or get some if you go on holiday to Italy. Seek out sheep\u2019s milk for the best flavour \u2013 they make it in the Dolomites, Sardinia and southern Italy. This recipe is one I made up in Sperlonga, where we normally eat ricotta every day. For breakfast or lunch, or dinner\u2019s antipasto, room temperature with oil and rocket and bread; stuffed into courgette flowers; baked into a dessert or whipped with sugar and served with strawberries. Or in pasta. Serves 4 rigatoni 400g (or penne rigati or tortiglioni) ricotta 250g, preferably sheep\u2019s milk freshly ground black pepper 1 full tsp parmesan or pecorino romano 100g, grated guanciale 150g, cut into 5mm lardons, or pancetta cut the same way (for pancetta, which is less fatty, add also 2 tbsp olive oil Have ready a large pan of boiling, well-salted water, 10-12g salt per litre. Put the pasta on to boil. In a large bowl, whisk together the ricotta, pepper and half the grated cheese with a ladleful of the pasta water, until it\u2019s the texture of thick cream. Settle this bowl on the pasta pot, like a lid, to warm it. In a wide frying pan over a high heat, fry the guanciale (no oil \u2013 it has enough fat of its own) for 3-5 minutes, until it\u2019s crispy outside but still juicy within. When cooked, but al dente, drain the pasta and reserve a bowlful of its water. Toss the pasta in the guanciale and its cooking fat. Add the lot to the warmed ricotta mixture, stir to coat, and add a little more water if it gets claggy. Serve with the remaining grated cheese on top. NOTE: Guanciale is cured pig\u2019s cheek and jowl, like an \u00fcber-bacon, which is very fatty and piggy and spesh. For a vegetarian version of this dish, at least as flavoursome, omit it (and omit steps 4 and 6) and instead whisk into the ricotta 8 basil leaves (chopped), grated zest of 1 lemon, \u215b of a nutmeg (grated), and 3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil. SECONDO Baked bream with tomatoes, olives and rosemary Bream is a lovely, clean, white-fleshed fish. You can use any smallish white fish \u2013 bass or snapper or gurnard \u2013 whatever is freshest and most appealing. Beautiful fish should not be messed with. Serves 4 whole fish 1.5kg, very fresh, scaled and gutted (any number of fish but keep them whole) sea salt 25g baby plum tomatoes 800g, datterino are best, halved extra virgin olive oil 5 tbsp black olives 100g, stone-in and drained (gaeta if possible, otherwise kalamata or similar) rosemary 2 sprigs white wine 2 tbsp Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6. An hour or two before cooking, take the fish from the fridge. Inspect it for tenacious scales and rinse the belly. Rub it inside and out with half the salt. Let it come to room temperature. An hour or so (or more) before you plan to eat, toss the tomatoes with 4 tablespoons of the oil, spread them on a wide oven tray and bake for 25 minutes until condensed \u2013 you can do this ahead if you like. Take the tomatoes from the oven and scatter with the olives and rosemary. Lay the fish on top. Sprinkle with the wine and the remaining salt. Bake the fish \u2013 one 1-1.5kg beast will take 40 minutes (ish), roughly 750g fishes will take 30 minutes, and 400-600g specimens about 20 minutes. Test for doneness. You can use a food thermometer \u2013 you want an internal temperature of 55C \u2013 or test by gently pressing the fish with a finger; springy is underdone, just giving is perfect, firm or mushy is overdone. (Meaty fish goes firm, delicate fish goes mushy.) Or you can lift open the belly cavity with the tip of a knife and see if the flesh will \u2013 just \u2013 separate from the spine. Drizzle with the remaining oil and serve. Pan-fried greens If one thing gives me the greatest joy to eat it\u2019s a plate of properly cooked, totally tender, still vibrant and verdant greens. There are only two ways to serve them. Either boiled properly in plenty of well-salted water, refreshed and squeezed dry, then served room temperature with lemon and good olive oil. Or, as here, pan-fried with garlic and chilli. Serves 4 greens 1kg, cicoria (bitter green chicory), spinach, fine-stemmed chard or escarole extra virgin olive oil 4 tbsp garlic 1 large clove, thinly sliced crushed dried chilli 1 pinch Prepare the greens and wash them thoroughly. Cut them into large (10cm) pieces. Put a large pan of very well-salted water on to boil (as for pasta, 12g salt per litre). Boil the greens until they just lose any hint of crunch, so they are tender but still green. Drain, refresh in a colander under running water, and squeeze dry. Heat a frying pan over a medium heat. Add the oil and garlic at the same time. Fry until some of the garlic just begins to brown at the edges. Add the chilli, then straightaway the boiled greens. Reduce the heat to low and pan-fry, stirring, for 10 minutes or so until you are satisfied with the flavour. Salad with lemon dressing My wonderful mum makes wonderful salad. It is lemony and refreshing and simple. She sometimes serves it as we sit down, sometimes with the main, sometimes after, but it is always our favourite part of the meal. Serves 4 lemon 1 large and very juicy garlic 1 clove very good extra virgin olive oil 5 tbsp salt 1 tsp freshly ground pepper \u00bc tsp lettuce 1 large and very beautiful \u2013 round lettuce, romano (cos/romaine) or escarole Zest the lemon \u2013 use a potato peeler for a delicate dressing or a grater for a punchier one. Squeeze the lemon juice and crush the garlic. Stir together the lemon zest and juice, garlic, oil and seasoning. Wash the lettuce and spin it properly dry. Dress it and serve immediately. PUDDING Double torta caprese Capri is an ancient island of two halves, Capri and Anacapri. There are two types of visitor to the island: the raucous daytripping tourist and the vulgar bejewelled billionaire. There are two Capresi dishes: the caprese salad (tomato, mozzarella, basil) and the caprese cake (almond cake). And there are two caprese cakes: lemon and chocolate. Both sides of the island are beautiful, both visitors make for extremely entertaining people-watching, both Capresi dishes are delicious and both cakes are irresistible. Trying to have the best of both worlds, I make a torta caprese in two layers, dark and light. The lemon and chocolate cakes, united by almond, go beautifully together. Making two in one is double the effort, and you may be just as happy if you double the quantities of one mix, omitting the other. Serves 10-12 For the lemon layer blanched almonds 125g cornflour 20g caster sugar 125g eggs 2 large egg yolk 1 large unsalted butter 100g, softened lemon finely grated zest and juice of 1 decent limoncello 50ml baking powder 1 tsp For the chocolate layer blanched almonds 125g bitter chocolate 100g, chilled and broken into pieces cocoa powder 25g eggs 2 large, separated caster sugar 90g vanilla extract \u00bd tsp lemon finely grated zest of 1 small unsalted butter 100g, melted To serve icing sugar strawberries 100g per person, sliced, or whole wild strawberries caster sugar \u00bd tsp lemon juice a small squeeze Have ready a 23-24cm round cake tin, the bottom greased and lined with ovenproof paper. A loaf tin is another decent way to go. Making two cakes in one requires part-baking the first layer so it doesn\u2019t mix with the second, before baking both together. Preheat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4. Make the lemon mixture first. Grind the almonds finely with the cornflour and 25g of the sugar in a food processor. Whisk the whole eggs and egg yolk with the remaining sugar until pale, thick and fluffy. Combine with the ground almond mixture and all the other lemon cake ingredients. Fold together until just incorporated, pour into the lined baking tin and level approximately with the back of your spoon. Par-bake for 12-15 minutes until semi-set. While the lemon cake is baking, quickly make the chocolate mixture: grind the almonds, chocolate and cocoa powder in a food processor, as finely as you can without the chocolate melting and clumping the lot together. Whisk the egg yolks with the sugar, vanilla and lemon zest until very thick and pale. Add the chocolate and almond mixture. Start to stir \u2013 the mixture will be so thick it won\u2019t come together, so add the melted butter to help it along. Whisk the egg whites to soft peaks and fold them gently into the cake mix. Take the half-cooked lemon cake from the oven. Spoon the chocolate mixture over the top, and smooth it gently as best you can. Return the tin to the oven for another 30 minutes, until just set. Remove it from the oven and leave to cool partially, about 15 minutes, before unmoulding onto a plate. When cooled to room temperature, dust the top with icing sugar before you slice it. Toss the strawberries with the caster sugar and a drop of lemon juice, to serve alongside.

      "body": "<p>When the American photographer <a href=\"http://www.vivianmaier.com/\" title=\"\">Vivian Maier</a> died at the age of 83 in 2009, impoverished and alone, no one knew who she was. The 150,000 pictures she had taken on her beloved Rolleiflex during her lifetime \u2013 street portraits, mostly \u2013 had never been published; many of her negatives had never even been printed. But all that changed in 2009, when a collector who had acquired a portion of her archive put the images online. Ever since, she has been both a popular enigma and a celebrated artist, her photographs widely exhibited and increasingly expensive to buy. In 2013, she was the subject of an Oscar-nominated documentary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/20/finding-vivian-maier-review-exposure-photographer-nanny\" title=\"\"><em>Finding Vivian Maier</em></a>, and now we find the bare bones of her life at the heart of a playful, tricksy and sometimes exasperating novel by the Danish writer Christina Hesselholdt.</p> <p>The polyphonic <em>Vivian</em>, translated by Paul Russell Garrett, is delivered in postcard-size chunks of first-person narrative by a smallish cast of characters (some are fictionalised, others are not): in addition to Maier herself, we hear from those with whom she spent her transient childhood in the US and in France (her mother was French); from Sarah and Peter, a wealthy Chicago couple who employ her as a nanny; and from their daughter, her charge, Ellen. Also, more intrusively, from a \u201cnarrator\u201d who elbows her way into the story at various points, sometimes to ponder the significance of this or that event and sometimes to ask whether or not her technique is working.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m really not fond of documentaries with dramatised scenes,\u201d this narrator writes late on in her book. \u201cIn dark moments, I think I may have strayed into this horrible genre.\u201d She\u2019s right about this, but perhaps not in the way that she means. In <em>Vivian</em>, the \u201cdramatised scenes\u201d in which different characters all describe the same, usually distinctly weird occurrence, from their own point of view, often work brilliantly. Hesselholdt inhabits them in a way that makes you feel as though she spent time interviewing them (Maier, incidentally, liked shoving a microphone in the faces of strangers almost as much as she liked ambushing them with her camera).</p> <p>But her own voice is irritating and not only because her observations are frequently banal; having effectively cast a spell on the reader, she keeps breaking it and in a way that serves no real purpose. It\u2019s a device that feels strangely old-fashioned: a postmodernism, flash but clunky, that seems to belong to another decade (the 1980s?) altogether.</p> <p>Hesselholdt does not seek, particularly, to explain Maier; however tough and peculiar her childhood, it does not entirely account for her compulsions. (She was a hoarder; Hesselholdt has one of her employers reinforce the floor of her bedroom with a metal joist.) Nor, thank God, does she try to make her likable: her rudeness and tendency to hector and bully are fully on show. Nevertheless, it\u2019s with her that you want to be. Sarah and Peter learn to be deft in their handling of her; Ellen, too, comes to understand that, as she is so stubborn and prickly, she must be treated with kid gloves, even by a little girl. There is magnificent comedy in the fact that she serves for dinner dishes (salted ox tongue) her non-European employers cannot stomach; that they spend their time wondering what, exactly, she keeps behind her locked door (newspapers is the answer). But there is something more purely satisfying about being inside Vivian\u2019s head.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"164fa902861057374356625e3fc40d4972c08c41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/164fa902861057374356625e3fc40d4972c08c41/0_0_1400_1400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From Finding Vivian Maier\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From Finding Vivian Maier.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sportsphoto/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She knows that she is odd and yet she doesn\u2019t know it at all. There is something sealed off about her; she cannot quite fathom other human beings \u2013 and it\u2019s this, surely, that drove her to take so many portraits. The best of her work owes its veracity and spark to a split second of connection between herself and the stranger whose picture she is taking: she is a provocateur, uninterested in the question of permission \u2013 they are surprised, puzzled, indignant, furious.</p> <p>Hesselholdt, poking her nose round the door again, reveals that at an exhibition of Maier\u2019s photographs she saw in Helsingborg, she and a friend discussed how easily they tire of realism. She wonders, too, how Maier found the energy to take so many pictures, when the approach to her subject \u201cwas always the same\u201d. I have two things to say about this. First, that I never grow weary of Maier\u2019s work: its shadows and its tenderness, its curiosity and its pluck.

      "bodyText": "When the American photographer Vivian Maier died at the age of 83 in 2009, impoverished and alone, no one knew who she was. The 150,000 pictures she had taken on her beloved Rolleiflex during her lifetime \u2013 street portraits, mostly \u2013 had never been published; many of her negatives had never even been printed. But all that changed in 2009, when a collector who had acquired a portion of her archive put the images online. Ever since, she has been both a popular enigma and a celebrated artist, her photographs widely exhibited and increasingly expensive to buy. In 2013, she was the subject of an Oscar-nominated documentary, Finding Vivian Maier, and now we find the bare bones of her life at the heart of a playful, tricksy and sometimes exasperating novel by the Danish writer Christina Hesselholdt. The polyphonic Vivian, translated by Paul Russell Garrett, is delivered in postcard-size chunks of first-person narrative by a smallish cast of characters (some are fictionalised, others are not): in addition to Maier herself, we hear from those with whom she spent her transient childhood in the US and in France (her mother was French); from Sarah and Peter, a wealthy Chicago couple who employ her as a nanny; and from their daughter, her charge, Ellen. Also, more intrusively, from a \u201cnarrator\u201d who elbows her way into the story at various points, sometimes to ponder the significance of this or that event and sometimes to ask whether or not her technique is working. \u201cI\u2019m really not fond of documentaries with dramatised scenes,\u201d this narrator writes late on in her book. \u201cIn dark moments, I think I may have strayed into this horrible genre.\u201d She\u2019s right about this, but perhaps not in the way that she means. In Vivian, the \u201cdramatised scenes\u201d in which different characters all describe the same, usually distinctly weird occurrence, from their own point of view, often work brilliantly. Hesselholdt inhabits them in a way that makes you feel as though she spent time interviewing them (Maier, incidentally, liked shoving a microphone in the faces of strangers almost as much as she liked ambushing them with her camera). But her own voice is irritating and not only because her observations are frequently banal; having effectively cast a spell on the reader, she keeps breaking it and in a way that serves no real purpose. It\u2019s a device that feels strangely old-fashioned: a postmodernism, flash but clunky, that seems to belong to another decade (the 1980s?) altogether. Hesselholdt does not seek, particularly, to explain Maier; however tough and peculiar her childhood, it does not entirely account for her compulsions. (She was a hoarder; Hesselholdt has one of her employers reinforce the floor of her bedroom with a metal joist.) Nor, thank God, does she try to make her likable: her rudeness and tendency to hector and bully are fully on show. Nevertheless, it\u2019s with her that you want to be. Sarah and Peter learn to be deft in their handling of her; Ellen, too, comes to understand that, as she is so stubborn and prickly, she must be treated with kid gloves, even by a little girl. There is magnificent comedy in the fact that she serves for dinner dishes (salted ox tongue) her non-European employers cannot stomach; that they spend their time wondering what, exactly, she keeps behind her locked door (newspapers is the answer). But there is something more purely satisfying about being inside Vivian\u2019s head. She knows that she is odd and yet she doesn\u2019t know it at all. There is something sealed off about her; she cannot quite fathom other human beings \u2013 and it\u2019s this, surely, that drove her to take so many portraits. The best of her work owes its veracity and spark to a split second of connection between herself and the stranger whose picture she is taking: she is a provocateur, uninterested in the question of permission \u2013 they are surprised, puzzled, indignant, furious. Hesselholdt, poking her nose round the door again, reveals that at an exhibition of Maier\u2019s photographs she saw in Helsingborg, she and a friend discussed how easily they tire of realism. She wonders, too, how Maier found the energy to take so many pictures, when the approach to her subject \u201cwas always the same\u201d. I have two things to say about this. First, that I never grow weary of Maier\u2019s work: its shadows and its tenderness, its curiosity and its pluck. Second, that I think Hesselholdt\u2019s fatigue can be felt, with fatal consequences, in the pages of her novel. As it goes on, it winds down dispiritingly. She seems not to know where to go with her experiment, either because she does not want fully to deal with her subject as an old woman or because realism is, for her, simply too exhausting a prospect. If she sometimes brings Maier vividly to life, this is all too brief and I can\u2019t quite decide how it makes me feel.

      "body": "<h2>Ko Pha Ngan, Thailand <em>by Yasmin Khan, food writer</em></h2> <p>For the past eight years I\u2019ve been going to Ko Pha Ngan, on the Gulf of Thailand. The dish that I always want when I arrive is pad see ew. It\u2019s made with wide, flat rice noodles; the name means \u201cfried in soy sauce\u201d, because that\u2019s its main flavouring. I always get it from the same place. I don\u2019t really want to say the name of it, I don\u2019t want the whole world to descend \u2026 It\u2019s not a formal place, just a little beach hut on a bay. There are always fresh prawns and squid in the noodles, and it\u2019s slightly sweet and you have a bit of chilli and bean sprouts, too. I always get a mint and lemon shake, which is whizzed together with ice so it\u2019s a bit like a slushie. I always sit in the same spot on some rocks overlooking a bay and it feels like you\u2019re in a James Bond movie, one of those picture-perfect shots at the end, and I sit there eating my spicy sweet noodles and drinking my mint shake. Even thinking about it makes me more relaxed.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.restaurantvillamas.com\" title=\"\">Restaurant Villa M\u00e1s</a>, San Feli\u00fa de Gu\u00edxols, Spain <em>by Monica Galetti, chef-owner, Mere</em></h2> <p>Five years ago, I went to Spain to eat at one of my favourite restaurants, Cellar Can Roca, and then on to stay in a seaside town near Girona. We went to a local seafood restaurant for lunch and had the simplest thing: a plate of local langoustines seasoned with olive oil and a bit of salt. It was just perfect: by the seaside, beautiful ingredients, a great wine list. It was so good we went back two days later for dinner. It is like that, isn\u2019t it, when you\u2019re on holiday \u2013 you find somewhere special and you go back. </p> <h2>Jammal, Batroun, Lebanon <em>by Anissa Helou, food writer</em></h2> <p>Jammal is gorgeous, small, right on the water, in the north of Lebanon. It\u2019s one of the best fish restaurants in the country. A lot of people go there by boat, anchoring just outside the creek, and then row over in a dinghy, which gives it a very romantic atmosphere. It\u2019s a limited menu: a few mezze and then the fish of the day, caught by their own fishermen. The seafood is in a cabinet and you choose what you want and how you want it prepared.</p> <p>The last time I went, we had tiny red mullet, which they fry and bring with fried pitta and tahini sauce. And it\u2019s one of the few places that make tamriyeh: filo rolls with a cream inside, fried and sprinkled with icing sugar.</p> <p>I like to go just before sunset and stay for two or three hours enjoying the seaside, the food and the people. It\u2019s an absolutely delightful way to spend an evening.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>My face was covered in soup, my lips and tongue were stinging, but my belly was full and my smile was wide</p> <footer> <cite>Zoe Adjonyoh</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <h2>Budva, Montenegro <em>by Olia Hercules, food writer</em></h2> <p>A 10-day trip to Montenegro a few years ago was the best family holiday I\u2019ve ever had. I had just finished my second cookbook and we hired a <a href=\"http://villamonalisa-montenegro.com/\" title=\"\">house on the top of the mountain</a> near Budva with my parents and some of our best friends. We spent the whole time cooking and eating. The local markets had great tomatoes and yellow beans, loads of watermelons and fantastic crumbly sheep\u2019s cheeses. The fish was good, too. We made garfish egg patties and deep-fried whitebait in fine polenta. That\u2019s what I love about going on holidays: enjoying local produce as it is, without too much embellishment, without overthinking it.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://tiongbahru.market/\" title=\"\">Tiong Bahru market</a>, Singapore <em>by Chetna Makan, food writer</em></h2> <p>We went here on a local tip-off, queueing for a chicken curry that was totally worth the wait. There was also a peanut pancake: a thick fluffy pancake and in between was crumbly, just-broken-up peanuts with a hint of sweetness. Oh, and the coffee! It\u2019s called kopi and is made with condensed milk. It\u2019s so strong and sweet but amazingly tasty. I would definitely go back to Singapore just to eat.<br><em>Chetna\u2019s Healthy Indian </em><em>(Octopus, \u00a320) is out now</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.murphysicecream.ie/phone/about-us.html\" title=\"\">Murphy\u2019s Ice Cream,</a> Dublin <em>by Ruby Tandoh, food writer</em></h2> <p>There is no bad time to eat ice-cream. I\u2019ve eaten it in blizzards and in cars and on park benches and, more often than I\u2019m proud of, in bed. But some ice-creams are particularly special. My favourite was in Dublin, on a particularly dismal day of our \u201cromantic\u201d rainy November weekend away, when we had trudged along the banks of the swollen Liffey and gone on a trip to the wind-whipped Howth peninsula. Back in the city that evening, what we needed was a mug of tea, a pint or a Supermac\u2019s. But, true to form, I insisted on ice-cream.</p> <p>I feigned a perfunctory Google search for \u201cDublin ice-cream\u201d despite already knowing perfectly well the where (a shop called Murphy\u2019s in Wicklow Street, decked out in smart blue and cream) and the what (its Dingle sea salt flavour). Murphy\u2019s is an old-fashioned ice-cream parlour, with familiar flavours like strawberry and chocolate nestled alongside specialities such as Irish cream liqueur. But the sea-salt flavour, made with salt from Murphy\u2019s original home in Dingle, on the country\u2019s south-west coast, was the most beautiful ice-cream I\u2019ve had. It tasted of sea air and the best thick, yellow cream. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"adc54f7a0637e87f176b7f9737bde41a7d2ede9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adc54f7a0637e87f176b7f9737bde41a7d2ede9c/331_0_2519_2520/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Best place I\u2019ve eaten on holiday illustrations\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spiny rock lobster on the Amalfi coast.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Garry Walton/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"http://www.daadolfo.com/daAdolfo.html\" title=\"\">Da Adolfo</a>, Amalfi coast, Italy <em>by Sabrina Ghayour, food writer</em></h2> <p>In 2005, I went to the Amalfi coast for a cousin\u2019s wedding. A couple of days after the wedding, we took a boat to Capri and stopped off for lunch along the way. A little rowing boat picked us up and brought us to a restaurant on the shore \u2013 you can\u2019t get there by road. Everything was picked out of the sea right in front of us. They took really fresh sea bass and baked it in salt crust. They cut spiny rock lobster in half and pan-fried it. We had amazing clams. It was nothing swanky, it didn\u2019t cost us loads of money, as everything on the Amalfi coast tends to, but it was just the most mind-blowing meal.</p> <h2>Spaghetti Jazz, Dhaka, Bangladesh <em>by Asma Khan, chef-owner, Darjeeling Express, London</em></h2> <p>In Dhaka there\u2019s an Italian restaurant called <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Italian-Restaurant/Spaghetti-Jazz-107533745970194/\" title=\"\">Spaghetti Jazz</a>, which has the most beautiful food. The owner, Shaheen Khan, has a great passion for Italy and she brought it to Dhaka at a time when there was absolutely no food from the west available in the city. Last summer, I went there just after filming my episode of <em>Chef\u2019s Table</em> for Netflix and had the best lobster in my life, served very simply with fresh spaghetti and garlic butter. It\u2019s a fabulous place. Dhaka is a very changed society now, but what Shaheen did 25 years ago, by starting that restaurant, was really radical.</p> <h2>Tokyo, Japan <em>by Angela Hartnett, chef-owner, Murano, London</em></h2> <p>A few years ago, my partner, Neil, [Borthwick] and I went to Tokyo. What stood out were two amazing tempura places. At <a href=\"https://mikawa-zezankyo.jimdo.com/english-information/\" title=\"\">Mikawa Zezankyo</a>, the whole menu was just pictures of the dishes and we were blown away by how simple and incredibly delicious everything was. The second place, <a href=\"https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/restaurants/miyagawa\" title=\"\">Miyagawa</a>, was a really old tempura bar with 10 seats. The guy who ran it must have been 70 and did everything himself. I\u2019ve never had better tempura. There are brilliant places in New York and London that do it, but nothing compares with Tokyo.</p> <h2>San Sebasti\u00e1n, Spain <em>by Nuno Mendes, chef-patron, M\u00e3os</em></h2> <p>I love San Sebasti\u00e1n. My first ever holiday with my partner was there and I\u2019ve probably been back five or six times. It has lovely beaches, it\u2019s affordable and the food is outstanding.</p> <p>On my most recent visit, I went to a restaurant called Ibai and it was the most inspiring meal that I\u2019ve had in years. It\u2019s an old-school Basque restaurant in a little basement room that\u2019s only open during the week for lunch. Everything we ate was incredible: the lobster salad with citrus dressing, the teardrop peas, the St George mushrooms. The sole was hands-down the best I\u2019ve ever had in my life, but the highlight was the <em>kokotxas</em>, or hake throats, which were so good we had to order seconds. There are very few really old-school restaurants like that around any more. We should treasure them.</p> <h2>Mother\u2019s Kitchen, Naivasha, Kenya <em>by Claire Thomson, food writer</em></h2> <p>Earlier this year, my family had a really memorable meal at Mother\u2019s Kitchen. We had the local dish of githeri, a beany casserole, and ugali, a maize porridge which soaks up the stew. There was also amazing plantain cooked with tomato and ginger and a pile of chapatis and samosas. It was a bare-bones restaurant with Formica tables and a dinner lady who piled a mountain of food on to your plate, but so delicious. It was a special trip for me because I was born in Africa, living in Zimbabwe and then Botswana, and this was the first time I\u2019d gone back with the kids. </p> <h2>Edinburgh, Scotland <em>by Sam Evans, co-founder, Hang Fire Southern Kitchen, Barry</em></h2> <p>I was absolutely blown away by eating in Edinburgh, from street food to fine dining. El Cartel is a taco joint with amazing vegan and vegetarian tacos. L\u2019Escargot Bleu is everything you want in a classic French bistro: Le Creuset, vintage posters, pots simmering away for hours. We heard that Ondine did the best seafood: it\u2019s quite swanky, very decadent and a little bit expensive. It was out of this world. At the Edinburgh Food Studio I had probably the best brunch of my life of slow-cooked scrambled eggs, and homemade chocolate spread with buttermilk brioche and gorgeous marmalade. </p> <p>There was a swagger and huge sense of pride about everywhere that I went. They know they\u2019re good. And as an eater, you know you\u2019re in safe hands.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/mar/07/10-best-beach-bars-cafes-europe-seafood-beer-readers-tips\">10 of the best beach bars and cafes in Europe: readers\u2019 tips</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Peace Palace Chop Bar, Osu, Ghana <em>by Zoe Adjonyoh, chef-owner of Zoe\u2019s Ghana Kitchen, London</em></h2> <p>On holiday last August, I went on a two-day walking tour of Accra with my wife, Sara, to find the best places for local food. Peace Palace Chop Bar in Osu isn\u2019t much from the outside \u2013 a rickety affair as most chop bars are \u2013 but backstage is a full production of maybe a dozen women toiling over huge vats of stews and soups, or thumping <em>fufu</em> into shape, or churning <em>banku</em> out of its dense porridge-like state into perfect rounds.</p> <p>After investigating the various vats, I sat down to eat a huge bowl of goat \u201clight soup\u201d, a clear, spicy broth popular in Ghana. I finished it in minutes. My face was covered in soup, my lips and tongue were stinging, but my belly was full and my smile was wide. It was insanely delicious \u2013 the goat so tender, the broth addictive in its depth of flavour, yet incredibly light. I found a new standard for light soup at Peace\u2019s chop bar and a new level of respect for its preparation.</p> <h2>Penang, Malaysia <em>by Fuchsia Dunlop, food writer</em></h2> <p>Penang is a famous centre of street food. I stayed in George Town, which was the first British settlement in south-east Asia, and it\u2019s a mix of colonial architecture, mosques, Chinese temples. Culturally, it\u2019s a fascinating mix, so the food is like that, too: a mash-up of Chinese, Malay, Indian, Thai and Peranakan, which is Straits Chinese \u2013 a mix-up in itself of Chinese and Malay influences. For me, it was particularly interesting because they\u2019ve got Chinese food \u2013 mainly from the south: Cantonese, Teochew and Hokkien, styles from Guangdong/Fujian \u2013 mixing up with all these south-east Asian influences and then some Indian spices as well.</p> <p>One of the classic Penang street food dishes is char kway teow, stir-fried rice noodles with seafood and beaten duck egg and bean sprouts. Another famous one is Assam laksa, made with mackerel, tamarind, pineapple, chilli and mint, so you get this amazing spice, fruitiness and sourness. Peranakan food is from these mixed families with Chinese and Malay influences. One of the most delicious things I had of that cuisine is called otak-otak. It\u2019s sort of a fish mousse that\u2019s seasoned with makrut lime and chilli and then steamed in banana leaves.</p> <h2>Alfama, Lisbon <em>by </em><em>Ramael Scully</em><em>, chef-owner, Scully, London</em></h2> <p>The last holiday I really enjoyed was in Lisbon because I didn\u2019t go to any cheffy restaurants. It was just nice to eat sardines on the bone, grilled with a bit of lemon on the side. When you\u2019re dealing with crazy flavours all the time, sometimes you need some classic cooking in your life. Lisbon is beautiful \u2013 I started thinking, this could be my retirement plan right here. I went with an Australian friend, who I catch up with once a year in a different city. We stayed in Alfama, the old part of Lisbon, and didn\u2019t go to any posh places, just little dinky restaurants such as <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tabernamanueldagorda/\" title=\"\">Taberna Manuel da Gorda</a> and <a href=\"https://www.thefork.com/restaurant/casa-da-tia-helena/372281\" title=\"\">Casa da Tia Helena</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26d74c4e89638f8a4db369651c894c4fbd6aa242\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26d74c4e89638f8a4db369651c894c4fbd6aa242/0_124_3262_4076/800.jpg\" alt=\"Best place I\u2019ve eaten on holiday illustrations\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The most perfect produce \u2026 the tomatoes, the garlic, the capers \u2026 and the seafood\u2019: Alison Roman on Sicily.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Garry Walton/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Sicily, Italy <em>by Alison Roman, food writer</em></h2> <p>Last year, I went with a friend to Sicily and we rented places in Palermo and Salina, one of the Aeolian islands off the northern coast. We didn\u2019t eat at restaurants all that often; it was more that they had incredible markets and I was able to do so much excellent cooking. I grew up in California, which I felt had the most perfect produce, but Sicily might have it beat \u2013 the tomatoes, the garlic, the capers and the seafood, which was so fresh and cheap. On Salina, we stayed near the harbour in the town of Santa Marina. Down the road, a woman ran a tiny fish counter called <a href=\"https://b-m.facebook.com/pescherialampara/\" title=\"\">Pescheria a Lampara</a> and she sold beautiful squid, shrimp and swordfish. I\u2019d never seen anything like that seafood. </p> <h2>Pittulongu, Sardinia <em>by Chantelle Nicholson, chef-patron, Tredwell\u2019s</em></h2> <p>I went to Sardinia with a good friend in 2010 and we stayed at a little hotel right on the beach in Pittulongu. It was in the middle of nowhere, not very touristy, but we discovered a little food shop about 20 minutes\u2019 walk away which had the most incredible produce: cured ham that they sliced to order, beautiful cheese, and tomatoes that were perfectly ripe and super-sweet. It was so simple but delicious and we lived on it for the next few days, going back to the shop a couple of times in the hot beating sun to stock up. That holiday really stays in my mind because everything we ate was so good.</p> <h2>Ming Fu, Taipei <em>by </em><em>Erchen Chang</em><em>, chef and co-owner, Bao and Xu, London</em></h2> <p>Ming Fu does classic Taiwanese cuisine. It\u2019s very small \u2013 a husband and wife team, with six tables. You need to pre-book their really famous dishes: crab glutinous rice and Buddha jumps wall, a soup with amazing stock (you can have it made not on the traditional shark\u2019s fin base) in which they cook loads of delicacies. My favourite thing was the grilled baby abalone with soy-glazed mayo \u2013 perfect in terms of texture, so tender. The cooking and thinking behind the dishes are the kind of things that inspire me for Xu. </p> <h2>Asador Etxebarri, Axpe, Spain <em>by </em><em>Ana Gon\u00e7alves</em><em>, chef and co-owner, T\u0100 T\u0100 Eatery</em></h2> <p>Asador Etxebarri in the Basque Country is probably my favourite restaurant in the world. My partner Meng and I went for my birthday in 2017 and we went back for his birthday this year. The location, about an hour outside San Sebasti\u00e1n, is amazing and the products and the way they cook them is, for me, close to perfection. It\u2019s a family-run restaurant that focuses on cooking with fire, although it\u2019s done much more gently than you\u2019d expect. My favourite dish is the grilled whole squid, served with caramelised onions and black ink sauce. They also do a reduced milk ice-cream using smoked milk. Meng and I always joke that if we ever get married, we\u2019ll get married at Etxebarri.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ko Pha Ngan, Thailand by Yasmin Khan, food writer For the past eight years I\u2019ve been going to Ko Pha Ngan, on the Gulf of Thailand. The dish that I always want when I arrive is pad see ew. It\u2019s made with wide, flat rice noodles; the name means \u201cfried in soy sauce\u201d, because that\u2019s its main flavouring. I always get it from the same place. I don\u2019t really want to say the name of it, I don\u2019t want the whole world to descend \u2026 It\u2019s not a formal place, just a little beach hut on a bay. There are always fresh prawns and squid in the noodles, and it\u2019s slightly sweet and you have a bit of chilli and bean sprouts, too. I always get a mint and lemon shake, which is whizzed together with ice so it\u2019s a bit like a slushie. I always sit in the same spot on some rocks overlooking a bay and it feels like you\u2019re in a James Bond movie, one of those picture-perfect shots at the end, and I sit there eating my spicy sweet noodles and drinking my mint shake. Even thinking about it makes me more relaxed. Restaurant Villa M\u00e1s, San Feli\u00fa de Gu\u00edxols, Spain by Monica Galetti, chef-owner, Mere Five years ago, I went to Spain to eat at one of my favourite restaurants, Cellar Can Roca, and then on to stay in a seaside town near Girona. We went to a local seafood restaurant for lunch and had the simplest thing: a plate of local langoustines seasoned with olive oil and a bit of salt. It was just perfect: by the seaside, beautiful ingredients, a great wine list. It was so good we went back two days later for dinner. It is like that, isn\u2019t it, when you\u2019re on holiday \u2013 you find somewhere special and you go back. Jammal, Batroun, Lebanon by Anissa Helou, food writer Jammal is gorgeous, small, right on the water, in the north of Lebanon. It\u2019s one of the best fish restaurants in the country. A lot of people go there by boat, anchoring just outside the creek, and then row over in a dinghy, which gives it a very romantic atmosphere. It\u2019s a limited menu: a few mezze and then the fish of the day, caught by their own fishermen. The seafood is in a cabinet and you choose what you want and how you want it prepared. The last time I went, we had tiny red mullet, which they fry and bring with fried pitta and tahini sauce. And it\u2019s one of the few places that make tamriyeh: filo rolls with a cream inside, fried and sprinkled with icing sugar. I like to go just before sunset and stay for two or three hours enjoying the seaside, the food and the people. It\u2019s an absolutely delightful way to spend an evening. Budva, Montenegro by Olia Hercules, food writer A 10-day trip to Montenegro a few years ago was the best family holiday I\u2019ve ever had. I had just finished my second cookbook and we hired a house on the top of the mountain near Budva with my parents and some of our best friends. We spent the whole time cooking and eating. The local markets had great tomatoes and yellow beans, loads of watermelons and fantastic crumbly sheep\u2019s cheeses. The fish was good, too. We made garfish egg patties and deep-fried whitebait in fine polenta. That\u2019s what I love about going on holidays: enjoying local produce as it is, without too much embellishment, without overthinking it. Tiong Bahru market, Singapore by Chetna Makan, food writer We went here on a local tip-off, queueing for a chicken curry that was totally worth the wait. There was also a peanut pancake: a thick fluffy pancake and in between was crumbly, just-broken-up peanuts with a hint of sweetness. Oh, and the coffee! It\u2019s called kopi and is made with condensed milk. It\u2019s so strong and sweet but amazingly tasty. I would definitely go back to Singapore just to eat. Chetna\u2019s Healthy Indian (Octopus, \u00a320) is out now Murphy\u2019s Ice Cream, Dublin by Ruby Tandoh, food writer There is no bad time to eat ice-cream. I\u2019ve eaten it in blizzards and in cars and on park benches and, more often than I\u2019m proud of, in bed. But some ice-creams are particularly special. My favourite was in Dublin, on a particularly dismal day of our \u201cromantic\u201d rainy November weekend away, when we had trudged along the banks of the swollen Liffey and gone on a trip to the wind-whipped Howth peninsula. Back in the city that evening, what we needed was a mug of tea, a pint or a Supermac\u2019s. But, true to form, I insisted on ice-cream. I feigned a perfunctory Google search for \u201cDublin ice-cream\u201d despite already knowing perfectly well the where (a shop called Murphy\u2019s in Wicklow Street, decked out in smart blue and cream) and the what (its Dingle sea salt flavour). Murphy\u2019s is an old-fashioned ice-cream parlour, with familiar flavours like strawberry and chocolate nestled alongside specialities such as Irish cream liqueur. But the sea-salt flavour, made with salt from Murphy\u2019s original home in Dingle, on the country\u2019s south-west coast, was the most beautiful ice-cream I\u2019ve had. It tasted of sea air and the best thick, yellow cream. Da Adolfo, Amalfi coast, Italy by Sabrina Ghayour, food writer In 2005, I went to the Amalfi coast for a cousin\u2019s wedding. A couple of days after the wedding, we took a boat to Capri and stopped off for lunch along the way. A little rowing boat picked us up and brought us to a restaurant on the shore \u2013 you can\u2019t get there by road. Everything was picked out of the sea right in front of us. They took really fresh sea bass and baked it in salt crust. They cut spiny rock lobster in half and pan-fried it. We had amazing clams. It was nothing swanky, it didn\u2019t cost us loads of money, as everything on the Amalfi coast tends to, but it was just the most mind-blowing meal. Spaghetti Jazz, Dhaka, Bangladesh by Asma Khan, chef-owner, Darjeeling Express, London In Dhaka there\u2019s an Italian restaurant called Spaghetti Jazz, which has the most beautiful food. The owner, Shaheen Khan, has a great passion for Italy and she brought it to Dhaka at a time when there was absolutely no food from the west available in the city. Last summer, I went there just after filming my episode of Chef\u2019s Table for Netflix and had the best lobster in my life, served very simply with fresh spaghetti and garlic butter. It\u2019s a fabulous place. Dhaka is a very changed society now, but what Shaheen did 25 years ago, by starting that restaurant, was really radical. Tokyo, Japan by Angela Hartnett, chef-owner, Murano, London A few years ago, my partner, Neil, [Borthwick] and I went to Tokyo. What stood out were two amazing tempura places. At Mikawa Zezankyo, the whole menu was just pictures of the dishes and we were blown away by how simple and incredibly delicious everything was. The second place, Miyagawa, was a really old tempura bar with 10 seats. The guy who ran it must have been 70 and did everything himself. I\u2019ve never had better tempura. There are brilliant places in New York and London that do it, but nothing compares with Tokyo. San Sebasti\u00e1n, Spain by Nuno Mendes, chef-patron, M\u00e3os I love San Sebasti\u00e1n. My first ever holiday with my partner was there and I\u2019ve probably been back five or six times. It has lovely beaches, it\u2019s affordable and the food is outstanding. On my most recent visit, I went to a restaurant called Ibai and it was the most inspiring meal that I\u2019ve had in years. It\u2019s an old-school Basque restaurant in a little basement room that\u2019s only open during the week for lunch. Everything we ate was incredible: the lobster salad with citrus dressing, the teardrop peas, the St George mushrooms. The sole was hands-down the best I\u2019ve ever had in my life, but the highlight was the kokotxas, or hake throats, which were so good we had to order seconds. There are very few really old-school restaurants like that around any more. We should treasure them. Mother\u2019s Kitchen, Naivasha, Kenya by Claire Thomson, food writer Earlier this year, my family had a really memorable meal at Mother\u2019s Kitchen. We had the local dish of githeri, a beany casserole, and ugali, a maize porridge which soaks up the stew. There was also amazing plantain cooked with tomato and ginger and a pile of chapatis and samosas. It was a bare-bones restaurant with Formica tables and a dinner lady who piled a mountain of food on to your plate, but so delicious. It was a special trip for me because I was born in Africa, living in Zimbabwe and then Botswana, and this was the first time I\u2019d gone back with the kids. Edinburgh, Scotland by Sam Evans, co-founder, Hang Fire Southern Kitchen, Barry I was absolutely blown away by eating in Edinburgh, from street food to fine dining. El Cartel is a taco joint with amazing vegan and vegetarian tacos. L\u2019Escargot Bleu is everything you want in a classic French bistro: Le Creuset, vintage posters, pots simmering away for hours. We heard that Ondine did the best seafood: it\u2019s quite swanky, very decadent and a little bit expensive. It was out of this world. At the Edinburgh Food Studio I had probably the best brunch of my life of slow-cooked scrambled eggs, and homemade chocolate spread with buttermilk brioche and gorgeous marmalade. There was a swagger and huge sense of pride about everywhere that I went. They know they\u2019re good. And as an eater, you know you\u2019re in safe hands. Peace Palace Chop Bar, Osu, Ghana by Zoe Adjonyoh, chef-owner of Zoe\u2019s Ghana Kitchen, London On holiday last August, I went on a two-day walking tour of Accra with my wife, Sara, to find the best places for local food. Peace Palace Chop Bar in Osu isn\u2019t much from the outside \u2013 a rickety affair as most chop bars are \u2013 but backstage is a full production of maybe a dozen women toiling over huge vats of stews and soups, or thumping fufu into shape, or churning banku out of its dense porridge-like state into perfect rounds. After investigating the various vats, I sat down to eat a huge bowl of goat \u201clight soup\u201d, a clear, spicy broth popular in Ghana. I finished it in minutes. My face was covered in soup, my lips and tongue were stinging, but my belly was full and my smile was wide. It was insanely delicious \u2013 the goat so tender, the broth addictive in its depth of flavour, yet incredibly light. I found a new standard for light soup at Peace\u2019s chop bar and a new level of respect for its preparation. Penang, Malaysia by Fuchsia Dunlop, food writer Penang is a famous centre of street food. I stayed in George Town, which was the first British settlement in south-east Asia, and it\u2019s a mix of colonial architecture, mosques, Chinese temples. Culturally, it\u2019s a fascinating mix, so the food is like that, too: a mash-up of Chinese, Malay, Indian, Thai and Peranakan, which is Straits Chinese \u2013 a mix-up in itself of Chinese and Malay influences. For me, it was particularly interesting because they\u2019ve got Chinese food \u2013 mainly from the south: Cantonese, Teochew and Hokkien, styles from Guangdong/Fujian \u2013 mixing up with all these south-east Asian influences and then some Indian spices as well. One of the classic Penang street food dishes is char kway teow, stir-fried rice noodles with seafood and beaten duck egg and bean sprouts. Another famous one is Assam laksa, made with mackerel, tamarind, pineapple, chilli and mint, so you get this amazing spice, fruitiness and sourness. Peranakan food is from these mixed families with Chinese and Malay influences. One of the most delicious things I had of that cuisine is called otak-otak. It\u2019s sort of a fish mousse that\u2019s seasoned with makrut lime and chilli and then steamed in banana leaves. Alfama, Lisbon by Ramael Scully, chef-owner, Scully, London The last holiday I really enjoyed was in Lisbon because I didn\u2019t go to any cheffy restaurants. It was just nice to eat sardines on the bone, grilled with a bit of lemon on the side. When you\u2019re dealing with crazy flavours all the time, sometimes you need some classic cooking in your life. Lisbon is beautiful \u2013 I started thinking, this could be my retirement plan right here. I went with an Australian friend, who I catch up with once a year in a different city. We stayed in Alfama, the old part of Lisbon, and didn\u2019t go to any posh places, just little dinky restaurants such as Taberna Manuel da Gorda and Casa da Tia Helena. Sicily, Italy by Alison Roman, food writer Last year, I went with a friend to Sicily and we rented places in Palermo and Salina, one of the Aeolian islands off the northern coast. We didn\u2019t eat at restaurants all that often; it was more that they had incredible markets and I was able to do so much excellent cooking. I grew up in California, which I felt had the most perfect produce, but Sicily might have it beat \u2013 the tomatoes, the garlic, the capers and the seafood, which was so fresh and cheap. On Salina, we stayed near the harbour in the town of Santa Marina. Down the road, a woman ran a tiny fish counter called Pescheria a Lampara and she sold beautiful squid, shrimp and swordfish. I\u2019d never seen anything like that seafood. Pittulongu, Sardinia by Chantelle Nicholson, chef-patron, Tredwell\u2019s I went to Sardinia with a good friend in 2010 and we stayed at a little hotel right on the beach in Pittulongu. It was in the middle of nowhere, not very touristy, but we discovered a little food shop about 20 minutes\u2019 walk away which had the most incredible produce: cured ham that they sliced to order, beautiful cheese, and tomatoes that were perfectly ripe and super-sweet. It was so simple but delicious and we lived on it for the next few days, going back to the shop a couple of times in the hot beating sun to stock up. That holiday really stays in my mind because everything we ate was so good. Ming Fu, Taipei by Erchen Chang, chef and co-owner, Bao and Xu, London Ming Fu does classic Taiwanese cuisine. It\u2019s very small \u2013 a husband and wife team, with six tables. You need to pre-book their really famous dishes: crab glutinous rice and Buddha jumps wall, a soup with amazing stock (you can have it made not on the traditional shark\u2019s fin base) in which they cook loads of delicacies. My favourite thing was the grilled baby abalone with soy-glazed mayo \u2013 perfect in terms of texture, so tender. The cooking and thinking behind the dishes are the kind of things that inspire me for Xu. Asador Etxebarri, Axpe, Spain by Ana Gon\u00e7alves, chef and co-owner, T\u0100 T\u0100 Eatery Asador Etxebarri in the Basque Country is probably my favourite restaurant in the world. My partner Meng and I went for my birthday in 2017 and we went back for his birthday this year. The location, about an hour outside San Sebasti\u00e1n, is amazing and the products and the way they cook them is, for me, close to perfection.

Kier not immune to forces that dragged down Carillion There is an arc of success, declining towards failure, that traces the fortunes of Britain\u2019s major infrastructure-building companies over the last 20 years. Firms like Carillion, which went bust early last year, grew fat on the juicy returns from working on new schools, hospitals and railway lines commissioned by Tony Blair\u2019s and Gordon Brown\u2019s administrations. Then came the financial crash, which coincided with a growing understanding inside government of how to write a contract with a private provider and not get ripped off.

But problems with designing and building major UK infrastructure projects continue \u2013 as does the arc of decline for the UK\u2019s private contractors. Green needs yet more clever manoeuvres to dodge Arcadia crash Sir Philip Green boasted last week that he had \u201cwon 7-0\u201d in his showdown with landlords over the future of his Arcadia retail empire, and in the process had swerved a \u201ccar crash\u201d. This sounds like great news for many of the 18,000 people that Arcadia employs at its 570 shops \u2013 although we know that nearly 1,200 of their jobs are already set to go. The rest must be feeling nervous. It is likely that Green\u2019s landlords will hand back the keys on at least 10% of the almost 200 stores for which Arcadia secured rent cuts under the restructuring scheme. Arcadia itself will also want to shut more shops than the 50 already scheduled for closure under the plan so that it can focus resources on those with a real future. Its brands also need culling.

His family has enjoyed bumper paydays from Arcadia for many years: since 2005, they have taken out at least \u00a31.5bn in dividends and payments related to BHS. The Green family\u2019s contribution of \u00a3100m into Arcadia\u2019s pension pot and \u00a350m in new cash was crucial in keeping it afloat last week.

      "body": "<p>An oil price surge prompted by trouble in the Middle East inevitably conjures up memories of late 1973, when a dramatic rise in the cost of crude ended the long postwar global economic boom.</p> \n<p>No question, the embargo organised by Opec during the Yom Kippur war was a game changer. The west had got used to oil prices of around $2 a barrel; within weeks it was paying $11 a barrel. Inflation soared, growth slowed, unemployment hit levels not seen since the 1930s.</p> \n<p>So the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/14/trump-iran-oil-tanker-attacks-nation-of-terror\">attack on two tankers </a>in the strait of Hormuz last week was freighted with history. In 1973, Arab states decided to use oil as an economic weapon in the hope that the west would put pressure on Israel. One explanation for last week\u2019s incidents is that Tehran \u2013 faced with crippling US sanctions \u2013 has decided that if Donald Trump is going to mess with the Iranian economy then it will mess with the US (and global) economy.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/13/what-impact-could-oil-tanker-attacks-have-on-global-economy-gulf-oman\">What impact could oil tanker attacks have on global economy?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Iran denies responsibility, but if this was its thinking the timing was smart. This is not the end of a quarter of a century of strong and uninterrupted growth \u2013 as was the case in 1973. It is more like the late 1970s, when the world economy was hit by a second oil shock triggered by the war between Iran and Iraq.</p> \n<p>By the time Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979, the global economy had still not fully recovered from the recession earlier in the decade. A period of stagflation \u2013 simultaneously rising inflation and unemployment \u2013 had left deep scars. Growth had eventually picked up, but the repair job was incomplete. The second oil shock exposed vulnerabilities; the upshot was a further burst of inflation and a second recession, this one even more painful than the first.</p> \n<p>The response to the first oil shock was \u2013 in most of the west \u2013 an attempt to do some running repairs to keep the postwar full employment model on the road. The response to the second oil shock was a complete system change. For the new breed of monetarists, control of inflation took precedence. The age of independent central banks dawned.</p> \n<p>Similarly, the global economy has never properly recovered from the banking crisis of 2008. In the years since, central banks and finance ministries have been desperate to proclaim that life has returned to normal, but it has not.</p> \n<p>Low unemployment suggests there is little to worry about. The jobless rate is at its lowest since early 1975 in the UK and has not been lower in the US since 1969, the year of Woodstock and the first manned moon landing.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"532e8393-b5fb-4cb9-9af1-f0ab3c7a0cbb\" data-atom-type=\"timeline\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Timeline\">\n    <p><i>(May 12, 2019)</i>&nbsp;<strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The UAE says four commercial ships off its eastern coast 'were subjected to sabotage operations'.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(May 14, 2019)</i>&nbsp;<strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Yemen's Houthi rebels launch a drone attack on Saudi Arabia, striking a major oil pipeline and taking it out of service.

      "bodyText": "An oil price surge prompted by trouble in the Middle East inevitably conjures up memories of late 1973, when a dramatic rise in the cost of crude ended the long postwar global economic boom. No question, the embargo organised by Opec during the Yom Kippur war was a game changer. The west had got used to oil prices of around $2 a barrel; within weeks it was paying $11 a barrel. Inflation soared, growth slowed, unemployment hit levels not seen since the 1930s. So the attack on two tankers in the strait of Hormuz last week was freighted with history. In 1973, Arab states decided to use oil as an economic weapon in the hope that the west would put pressure on Israel. One explanation for last week\u2019s incidents is that Tehran \u2013 faced with crippling US sanctions \u2013 has decided that if Donald Trump is going to mess with the Iranian economy then it will mess with the US (and global) economy. Iran denies responsibility, but if this was its thinking the timing was smart. This is not the end of a quarter of a century of strong and uninterrupted growth \u2013 as was the case in 1973. It is more like the late 1970s, when the world economy was hit by a second oil shock triggered by the war between Iran and Iraq. By the time Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979, the global economy had still not fully recovered from the recession earlier in the decade. A period of stagflation \u2013 simultaneously rising inflation and unemployment \u2013 had left deep scars. Growth had eventually picked up, but the repair job was incomplete. The second oil shock exposed vulnerabilities; the upshot was a further burst of inflation and a second recession, this one even more painful than the first. The response to the first oil shock was \u2013 in most of the west \u2013 an attempt to do some running repairs to keep the postwar full employment model on the road. The response to the second oil shock was a complete system change. For the new breed of monetarists, control of inflation took precedence. The age of independent central banks dawned. Similarly, the global economy has never properly recovered from the banking crisis of 2008. In the years since, central banks and finance ministries have been desperate to proclaim that life has returned to normal, but it has not. Low unemployment suggests there is little to worry about. The jobless rate is at its lowest since early 1975 in the UK and has not been lower in the US since 1969, the year of Woodstock and the first manned moon landing. But as David Blanchflower, a former member of the Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee, argues in his new book*, the labour market is not nearly as robust as the headline figures would suggest. Blanchflower says that if Britain and the US were really operating at full employment then wage growth would be a lot stronger. The fact that pressure for higher wages is much weaker than it was before the financial crisis means that genuine full employment is still some way off. Many people are underemployed, Blanchflower says, working fewer hours than they would like and often doing jobs for which they are over-qualified. Far from being a golden era for workers, this is actually an age of insecurity. This all rings eerily true. A decade of ultra-low interest rates ought to have delivered a humdinger of a recovery but it has failed to do so. Central banks keep looking for inflationary pressure that simply isn\u2019t there.

The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBshyyKQQoY&amp;feature=youtu.be\">modern-day pogrom</a> in 2013 seemed like a warning: whatever Georgia\u2019s aspirations to join Europe, its queer community would be left behind.</p> <p>But this week activists are planning the country\u2019s first LGBT pride events in a gambit to convert the underground explosion of queer culture in Georgia into political change. Arrayed against them are conservative and Christian activists and a police force that says they can\u2019t guarantee the safety of the protesters. Many fear the violence of 2013 could be repeated.</p> <p>\u201cPride is always controversial,\u201d said Giorgi Tabagari, one of the organisers of this year\u2019s events, which will conclude with a \u201cdignity march\u201d. \u201cBut how long can we hide?

Georgia\u2019s patriarch this week called for authorities to block pride, accusing anti-homophobia groups of promoting the \u201csin of Sodom\u201d. Police detained nine people on Friday after conservative activists attacked a pro-LGBT rally in downtown Tbilisi.</p> <p>The preparations for pride have sparked a national conversation and controversy within the LGBT community.

Nia Gvatua, the owner, offers a glass of champagne as she recalls her pitch to a friendly businessman to open a gay bar. He immediately handed her $20,000 (\u00a315,700) in cash.

      "bodyText": "Six years on, the violent scene remains imprinted in the minds of Georgia\u2019s LGBT community: dozens of gay rights demonstrators being beaten in the streets of Tbilisi by black-frocked priests and far-right protesters, some bearing clubs and other weapons. The modern-day pogrom in 2013 seemed like a warning: whatever Georgia\u2019s aspirations to join Europe, its queer community would be left behind. But this week activists are planning the country\u2019s first LGBT pride events in a gambit to convert the underground explosion of queer culture in Georgia into political change. Arrayed against them are conservative and Christian activists and a police force that says they can\u2019t guarantee the safety of the protesters. Many fear the violence of 2013 could be repeated. \u201cPride is always controversial,\u201d said Giorgi Tabagari, one of the organisers of this year\u2019s events, which will conclude with a \u201cdignity march\u201d. \u201cBut how long can we hide? If we saw government was effective at combating homophobia and moving in a different direction, maybe there would not be a need for us to do a risky decision like pride. But we need to decide whether to remain with the status quo or to push harder.\u201d An ex-Soviet state nestled in the South Caucasus, Georgia usually finds its way into headlines for its ongoing conflict with Russia or, lately, as a tourist haven with a booming culinary scene. The Georgian Orthodox church, the most trusted institution in the country according to polls, wields enormous power and wants to see the country remain a bastion of conservatism. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like a theocracy,\u201d said one person close to the government, who asked not to be named. Georgia\u2019s patriarch this week called for authorities to block pride, accusing anti-homophobia groups of promoting the \u201csin of Sodom\u201d. Police detained nine people on Friday after conservative activists attacked a pro-LGBT rally in downtown Tbilisi. The preparations for pride have sparked a national conversation and controversy within the LGBT community. The group has released videos with young gay, lesbian, and transgender people and allies stating openly that they support the event, a bold show of support that risks the public shaming and cyberbullying of them and their families. \u201cComing out is a very courageous thing for people to do,\u201d said Tabagari, who estimated that 500,000 people in a country of 3.5 million have seen the videos. \u201cWhen you start speaking in the first person, you trigger empathy. You get more supporters. We hope the majority get used to the idea that there are queer people around you.\u201d Every time he comes to Tbilisi, a 17-year-old who goes by the name Drago Flowers queues for the bus in Rustavi, 30 minutes away. Rail-thin with dyed hair, rainbow eyeshadow and tattooed legs, he\u2019s targeted so often with homophobic slurs and violence that he\u2019s become a regular in the local police station. \u201cI\u2019d rather be beaten up than hide who I am,\u201d said Flowers. \u201cHiding it would be torture.\u201d A video blogger who dreams of moving to New York one day, for now he focuses on his work as a make-up artist and performing in drag shows in some of Tbilisi\u2019s gay-friendly clubs, where he claims to be the only person capable of doing a death drop, an acrobatic move popular in a dance form called Vogue. He says he plans to attend pride. But is the country ready? \u201cMaybe in 100 years,\u201d he joked. Club culture has led to this moment. Several of Tbilisi\u2019s underground clubs have become incubators for political and equality movements, and police raids against the largest nightclub, Bassiani, sparked a protest movement called \u201cWhite Noise,\u201d a cross between a block party and street protest calling for drug decriminalisation. Alongside Bassiani\u2019s Horoom parties, LGBT nights where attendees must past an online screening and are banned from taking photographs, Flowers also named the club Success Bar as one of the few, new safe spaces in the city for queer people and allies to mingle. The party only gets started after midnight at Success Bar, a subterranean space inspired by the Berlin gay bars Roses and Barbie Deinhoff. Nia Gvatua, the owner, offers a glass of champagne as she recalls her pitch to a friendly businessman to open a gay bar. He immediately handed her $20,000 (\u00a315,700) in cash. Since then, she\u2019s been robbed, raided and picketed, all while Success Bar has grown to become part of the LGBT community. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people go from hiding in the corner in Success to being more open and confident. I see progress,\u201d said Gvatua. \u201cSome things have changed since 2013. There was no Bassiani. There was no Success Bar like this. There was no anti-discrimination law.\u201d While activists claim that Georgia has become more liberal since 2013, their opponents have been working to make it more conservative. After 2013, the church named 17 May \u201cFamily Values Day,\u201d holding marches on the same day that LGBT groups organise anti-homophobia demonstrations. Far-right parties, like the neo-fascist Georgian March, have promised to disrupt any attempt to hold a Tbilisi pride, blaming the liberal bogeyman George Soros. Tabagari said that LGBT people had become a popular target for fringe parties that want to gain visibility. \u201cI view this as a clear and present danger,\u201d Levan Vasadze, a wealthy Georgian businessman who is close to the church, said in an interview. \u201cI believe that drug addiction, perversion, our weakening of the family institute under the slogans of self-expression, tolerance and freedom, are killing my nation. We are not here to pose or whine. We view this as a true war.\u201d Vasadze is an outspoken voice for Georgian conservatism. He has forged ties to religious conservatives overseas, hosting the 2016 World Congress of Families, which was attended by George W Bush and blessed by the Georgian patriarch Ilia II. He blames Western \u201cindividualism\u201d for corrupting Georgians and is staunchly anti-abortion. \u201cThe mother\u2019s womb is supposed to be the safest place for children. We have made it a hell on earth.\u201d Vasadze said in a televised address that he has \u201cwarned\u201d the government that a pride event could end in \u201cprofound civil unrest\u201d. Despite receiving threats and a recent warning from the interior ministry that it could not provide security in the centre of the city, the organisers of Pride say they will move forward with plans to hold the event. Visibility is key, they say, and they believe they\u2019re reaching people, starting with their own families. After she came out as lesbian, Nino Bolkvadze\u2019s relatives from her native village stopped speaking with her for seven years. It took a health scare for them to reach out, inviting Bolkvadze and her girlfriend to visit. \u201cIt was amazing,\u201d said Bolkvadze, another organiser who regularly appears on television. \u201cSociety is becoming much more ready to accept gay people. I see this.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Kristina Keneally has reaffirmed Labor\u2019s support for the medevac legislation after Peter Dutton claimed the opposition is looking to repeal or amend the law which facilitates medical transfers from offshore detention. On Sunday the home affairs minister said that more than 30 people have come to Australia under the medevac bill and gave new details about the refugee swap deal with the United States, including that two Rwandans accused of murder are the only people to have come to Australia under the deal. Labor and the crossbench combined to pass the medevac bill in February over Coalition objections and Scott Morrison promised to repeal it if re-elected. Keneally, the shadow home affairs minister, and Labor leader Anthony Albanese have flagged they will continue to support the medevac legislation, despite the party\u2019s shock loss on 18 May. It will be subject to review by caucus, as with all policy taken to the 2019 election. On Sunday Dutton said the legislation creates \u201cquite a broad power\u201d to overrule the minister and order medical transfers. \u201cI understand Labor is reconsidering its position now and that they would be open to suggestions about how that bill could be repealed or at the very least wound back,\u201d he told ABC\u2019s Insiders. Keneally told Guardian Australia that Labor supports medevac because \u201cit provides a way for people who are sick to get the care they need and ensures minister has final discretion as to who can come\u201d but did not rule out consideration of amendments. \u201cWhat Mr Dutton\u2019s comments today misconstrued is that second aspect of the legislation \u2013 he did not recognise the fact the parliament explicitly ensured the minister retained that discretion. \u201cIf the government seeks to repeal medevac they need to explain to the parliament why that is necessary.\u201d Earlier, Dutton claimed the Coalition\u2019s harsh policies towards asylum seekers have been a success, with the number of refugees and asylum seekers on Manus Island and Nauru falling from 2,000 to just over 800. \u201cI want people off Manus and Nauru overnight, but I want to do it in a way that doesn\u2019t restart boats, kids drowning at sea et cetera,\u201d he said, citing people smuggling ventures in Sri Lanka to support the claim boats could restart. Dutton revealed that \u201cjust over 30\u201d asylum seekers have been brought to Australia under medevac, but said \u201cmany hundreds of people\u201d who required medical attention had been taken off Manus and Nauru under pre-existing provisions. Keneally said the fact dozens of people had come to Australia using the medevac provisions and other processes suggests the Morrison government \u201cseems to have come to a belated realisation that, while Labor and the broader community supports Operation Sovereign Borders, Australians do not like the idea of their government denying sick people the medical care they need\u201d. Dutton revealed that 531 people have gone from Manus and Nauru to the United States under a controversial refugee swap deal, with a further 295 \u201cin the pipeline, where they\u2019ve got approvals but they haven\u2019t been uplifted yet\u201d.

In May the Australian government was rocked by a report from Politico that Australia gave humanitarian protection to Leonidas Bimenyimana and Gregoire Nyaminani, two Rwandan men who had been charged with murder, on request from the US government. Dutton told Insiders the Australian government doesn\u2019t have \u201cplans to bring any others from America at this stage\u201d. \u201cBut we\u2019ll look at discussions with the US, UK, Canada, New Zealand \u2013 our closest partners \u2026 into the future we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d Dutton said he was \u201cnot sure\u201d the two men were guilty of killing tourists with machetes \u2013 which they confessed to under torture \u2013 and said the Australian government \u201cwill not take someone who is a risk to the Australian people\u201d. Dutton said the government had acted on the advice of experts with \u201cfull information\u201d including Australian Border Force and US intelligence agencies. Asked about the controversial $423m contract given to security contractor Paladin in Papua New Guinea, Dutton said it was an issue for the home affairs department whether it would be renewed in two weeks. He said the \u201clikely arrangement is that there will be a continuation\u201d of the Paladin contract.",

      "body": "<p>Lena Headey has been an actor for the better part of three decades, but the experience has not eased the doubt she has in her abilities. And even near-universal praise of the kind she received for her portrayal of Cersei Lannister in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/game-of-thrones\" title=\"\">Game of Thrones</a></em> doesn\u2019t do the trick.</p> <p>\u201cNo, it makes me doubt myself more,\u201d she says, when we meet in her apartment-like suite at the Soho House in Berlin. \u201cBecause you think they must be fucking lying.\u201d</p> <p>Headey, who speaks a kind of metropolitan RP spiced up with Yorkshire vowels, cockney glottal stops and Californian grammar, swears liberally and enthusiastically. With her prominent tattoos and an endearingly earthy attitude, it\u2019s fair to say that she betrays none of Cersei\u2019s regal airs.</p> <p>Nor is she making a play for sympathy or approbation. What she means is that there is no way of establishing objective criteria for what makes a performance \u201cgood\u201d, and people are acclaimed for a variety of reasons, many of which are insincere.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to push away the voice that goes, \u2018You\u2019re fucking shit, mate\u2019\u201d, she says, laughing, \u201cwhich is really hard some days.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/04/18/the-raw-appeal-of-game-of-thrones\" title=\"\">Writing in the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/04/18/the-raw-appeal-of-game-of-thrones\" title=\"\">New Yorker,</a></em><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/04/18/the-raw-appeal-of-game-of-thrones\" title=\"\"> </a>Clive James described Headey\u2019s Cersei as \u201ca beautiful expression of arbitrary terror, combining shapely grace with limitless evil in just the right measure to scare a man to death while rendering him helpless with desire.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I was much younger, I would weep every time I ended a job\u2026 it was such an intense experience</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He wasn\u2019t lying. Watching her in <em>Game of Thrones</em> \u2013 and she was never less than watchable \u2013 was like a study in tyranny as a seductive art. There was something magnetically human about her inhumanity. You were drawn to her devious charms even as you recoiled from her brutal deeds.</p> <p>At its best the show managed to transcend the blushing fact that it contained fire-breathing dragons and armies of demented zombies. And it was most often at its best when Headey was on screen and radiating cold calculation and ruthless intrigue.</p> <p>By common agreement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/20/game-of-thrones-was-this-the-cheesiest-ending-in-tv-history\" title=\"\">it was at its worst in the final series,</a> which managed to be both torturously slow and narratively rushed. Aside from the clunky plotting, the problem was that many of the best characters, played by actors of the calibre of Diana Rigg, Charles Dance, Jonathan Pryce, Stephen Dillane and Michelle Fairley, had been killed off, exposing the limitations of some of the actors in the leading roles, which up until then had been more symbolic than dramatic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"10a3feb630d99466cbab509c17e3cbf8cf606e27\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10a3feb630d99466cbab509c17e3cbf8cf606e27/0_6_3155_1893/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lena Headey as Cersei Lannister in series seven of Game of Thrones.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Headey as Cersei Lannister in series seven of Game of Thrones.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But as the denouement approached, the leads were called upon to drive the drama and, like the script, were not quite up to the job. When I outline this theory, Headey is careful not to take the bait.</p> <p>\u201cNo, listen,\u201d she says, \u201cI invested as a viewer and I have my favourite characters. And I\u2019ve got a few of my own gripes. But I haven\u2019t sat down drunkly with David [Benioff] and Dan [Weiss] yet.\u201d</p> <p>Benioff and Weiss are the two showrunners who adapted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/may/24/game-of-thrones-has-finished-on-tv-but-we-should-wait-for-the-final-books\" title=\"\">George RR Martin\u2019s books</a> and made one of the world\u2019s most popular TV series.</p> <p>What will she say when she has that drink?</p> <p>\u201cI will say I wanted a better death.\u201d</p> <p>In the penultimate episode Cersei was crushed by falling masonry along with her brother-lover Jaime (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau). It was an underwhelming end, to put it politely.</p> <p>\u201cObviously you dream of your death,\u201d she says. \u201cYou could go in any way on that show. So I was kind of gutted. But I just think they couldn\u2019t have pleased everyone. No matter what they did, I think there was going to be some big comedown from the climb.\u201d</p> <p>Following the anticlimactic finale, reports emerged of actors experiencing a difficult aftermath. Kit Harington, who played Jon Snow, released a statement confirming that he had checked into a luxury rehab in Connecticut. Headey suffered no such post-dramatic stress syndrome.</p> <p>She\u2019s still in touch with many of what she calls the \u201cThroners\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re all on a giant WhatsApp group which is a daily pile-on,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s hilarious. You can tell who\u2019s been drinking on that one.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/may/24/game-of-thrones-has-finished-on-tv-but-we-should-wait-for-the-final-books\">Game of Thrones has finished on TV \u2013 but we should wait for the final books | Andy Welch</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But as for a comedown, it\u2019s not happened.</p> <p>\u201cIt was amazing,\u201d she says, with cheery pragmatism. \u201cAnd things end and you move on.\u201d</p> <p>Given that the show turned Headey from a low-profile supporting actor into a global star, it\u2019s rather a large nine-year commitment to move on from. But she\u2019s now 45 and, she says, too long in the tooth to get caught up in the emotional turmoil of jobs finishing.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was much younger I would weep every time I ended a job,\u201d she says, \u201cand I would take everybody\u2019s phone number, every single person I\u2019d ever said hello to, because it had been such an intense experience. And then you get older and you have more of those experiences and they become less intense. I think the guys who grew up on that show, they probably formed really deep friendships that will carry them through. But most of us have our own kids. If kids don\u2019t balance you, then nothing does.\u201d</p> <p>Headey has two children, a nine-year-old boy from a marriage that ended in 2011 and a three-year-old girl with film-maker Dan Cadan, from whom she is now separated. It\u2019s said that many years ago she had an affair with the actor Jerome Flynn that either ended badly or had an unfortunate reprise or both.</p> <p>That\u2019s hardly an unusual circumstance in the film business, but in their case they were both cast in <em>Game of Thrones </em>and, according to rumours coming from the set, such was the enmity that they had to be kept apart. During the course of eight seasons their characters were only brought together once, very briefly, and Headey\u2019s Cersei didn\u2019t so much as glance at Flynn\u2019s Bronn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e133a8e6c5c94f1401a0fb2ac7ab29ddd4eaec23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e133a8e6c5c94f1401a0fb2ac7ab29ddd4eaec23/900_0_2425_2425/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Headey in The Sarah Connor Chronicles in 2008.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Headey in Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles in 2008.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/WARNER BROS/Sportsphoto Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She now lives in East Dulwich in south London, after a short stint in her native Yorkshire, following 12 years in Los Angeles.</p> <p>Having made her debut as a 17-year-old in the film <em>Waterland</em>, Headey carved out a busy but not particularly notable career in the UK and then America. With her striking looks, she tended to be cast in thrillers and horror films that by and large didn\u2019t trouble the box-office charts.</p> <p>Perhaps her real breakthrough came in television, playing Sarah Connor in <em>Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles</em>. The short-lived series made little impact here, but her performance as a smart, tough woman did not go unnoticed in Hollywood. A couple of years later Peter Dinklage (Cersei\u2019s brother, Tyrion Lannister in <em>Game of Thrones)</em> suggested that Headey should read for a part in a script he\u2019d been given that mixed the fantasy genre with ribald characterisations and baroque power struggles.</p> <p>\u201cWe were doing this little indie in LA called<em> Pete Smalls is Dead</em>,\u201d she recalls. \u201cAnd we were all sharing like one square of a hot caravan.

      "bodyText": "Lena Headey has been an actor for the better part of three decades, but the experience has not eased the doubt she has in her abilities. And even near-universal praise of the kind she received for her portrayal of Cersei Lannister in Game of Thrones doesn\u2019t do the trick. \u201cNo, it makes me doubt myself more,\u201d she says, when we meet in her apartment-like suite at the Soho House in Berlin. \u201cBecause you think they must be fucking lying.\u201d Headey, who speaks a kind of metropolitan RP spiced up with Yorkshire vowels, cockney glottal stops and Californian grammar, swears liberally and enthusiastically. With her prominent tattoos and an endearingly earthy attitude, it\u2019s fair to say that she betrays none of Cersei\u2019s regal airs. Nor is she making a play for sympathy or approbation. What she means is that there is no way of establishing objective criteria for what makes a performance \u201cgood\u201d, and people are acclaimed for a variety of reasons, many of which are insincere. \u201cYou have to push away the voice that goes, \u2018You\u2019re fucking shit, mate\u2019\u201d, she says, laughing, \u201cwhich is really hard some days.\u201d Writing in the New Yorker, Clive James described Headey\u2019s Cersei as \u201ca beautiful expression of arbitrary terror, combining shapely grace with limitless evil in just the right measure to scare a man to death while rendering him helpless with desire.\u201d He wasn\u2019t lying. Watching her in Game of Thrones \u2013 and she was never less than watchable \u2013 was like a study in tyranny as a seductive art. There was something magnetically human about her inhumanity. You were drawn to her devious charms even as you recoiled from her brutal deeds. At its best the show managed to transcend the blushing fact that it contained fire-breathing dragons and armies of demented zombies. And it was most often at its best when Headey was on screen and radiating cold calculation and ruthless intrigue. By common agreement it was at its worst in the final series, which managed to be both torturously slow and narratively rushed. Aside from the clunky plotting, the problem was that many of the best characters, played by actors of the calibre of Diana Rigg, Charles Dance, Jonathan Pryce, Stephen Dillane and Michelle Fairley, had been killed off, exposing the limitations of some of the actors in the leading roles, which up until then had been more symbolic than dramatic. But as the denouement approached, the leads were called upon to drive the drama and, like the script, were not quite up to the job. When I outline this theory, Headey is careful not to take the bait. \u201cNo, listen,\u201d she says, \u201cI invested as a viewer and I have my favourite characters. And I\u2019ve got a few of my own gripes. But I haven\u2019t sat down drunkly with David [Benioff] and Dan [Weiss] yet.\u201d Benioff and Weiss are the two showrunners who adapted George RR Martin\u2019s books and made one of the world\u2019s most popular TV series. What will she say when she has that drink? \u201cI will say I wanted a better death.\u201d In the penultimate episode Cersei was crushed by falling masonry along with her brother-lover Jaime (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau). It was an underwhelming end, to put it politely. \u201cObviously you dream of your death,\u201d she says. \u201cYou could go in any way on that show. So I was kind of gutted. But I just think they couldn\u2019t have pleased everyone. No matter what they did, I think there was going to be some big comedown from the climb.\u201d Following the anticlimactic finale, reports emerged of actors experiencing a difficult aftermath. Kit Harington, who played Jon Snow, released a statement confirming that he had checked into a luxury rehab in Connecticut. Headey suffered no such post-dramatic stress syndrome. She\u2019s still in touch with many of what she calls the \u201cThroners\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re all on a giant WhatsApp group which is a daily pile-on,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s hilarious. You can tell who\u2019s been drinking on that one.\u201d But as for a comedown, it\u2019s not happened. \u201cIt was amazing,\u201d she says, with cheery pragmatism. \u201cAnd things end and you move on.\u201d Given that the show turned Headey from a low-profile supporting actor into a global star, it\u2019s rather a large nine-year commitment to move on from. But she\u2019s now 45 and, she says, too long in the tooth to get caught up in the emotional turmoil of jobs finishing. \u201cWhen I was much younger I would weep every time I ended a job,\u201d she says, \u201cand I would take everybody\u2019s phone number, every single person I\u2019d ever said hello to, because it had been such an intense experience. And then you get older and you have more of those experiences and they become less intense. I think the guys who grew up on that show, they probably formed really deep friendships that will carry them through. But most of us have our own kids. If kids don\u2019t balance you, then nothing does.\u201d Headey has two children, a nine-year-old boy from a marriage that ended in 2011 and a three-year-old girl with film-maker Dan Cadan, from whom she is now separated. It\u2019s said that many years ago she had an affair with the actor Jerome Flynn that either ended badly or had an unfortunate reprise or both. That\u2019s hardly an unusual circumstance in the film business, but in their case they were both cast in Game of Thrones and, according to rumours coming from the set, such was the enmity that they had to be kept apart. During the course of eight seasons their characters were only brought together once, very briefly, and Headey\u2019s Cersei didn\u2019t so much as glance at Flynn\u2019s Bronn. She now lives in East Dulwich in south London, after a short stint in her native Yorkshire, following 12 years in Los Angeles. Having made her debut as a 17-year-old in the film Waterland, Headey carved out a busy but not particularly notable career in the UK and then America. With her striking looks, she tended to be cast in thrillers and horror films that by and large didn\u2019t trouble the box-office charts. Perhaps her real breakthrough came in television, playing Sarah Connor in Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles. The short-lived series made little impact here, but her performance as a smart, tough woman did not go unnoticed in Hollywood. A couple of years later Peter Dinklage (Cersei\u2019s brother, Tyrion Lannister in Game of Thrones) suggested that Headey should read for a part in a script he\u2019d been given that mixed the fantasy genre with ribald characterisations and baroque power struggles. \u201cWe were doing this little indie in LA called Pete Smalls is Dead,\u201d she recalls. \u201cAnd we were all sharing like one square of a hot caravan. Pete said you\u2019ve got to read this. I love Pete. I think he\u2019s wonderful and so I was like: \u2018Oh, if Pete\u2019s reading it, it must be fucking great.\u2019 That was my measure.\u201d Used to projects with brief shelf-lives, she thought she\u2019d go to Scotland and \u201chave a laugh for a month\u201d. A decade later she was earning, according to the Hollywood Reporter, $1m per episode for the eighth and final series of Game of Thrones. That kind of success and that kind of money is life-changing. In terms of her career, it means she\u2019s now sent scripts in which she is actively interested. Doors are opened, meetings are made, and everywhere she can expect the star treatment. But all of that comes with greatly increased fame, scrutiny and public recognition, none of which she much enjoys. \u201cSometimes when you\u2019re on the tube and suddenly someone nudges somebody else,\u201d she says. \u201cI panic in those situations. I go, fuck, I don\u2019t know how to handle that. Or someone chases you out of a tube \u2013 that\u2019s the weirdest thing. Those moments I hate.\u201d You still travel by tube? I ask with surprise. Apparently she does. The quid pro quo for the fame \u2013 aside from the money \u2013 is, that it \u201cgives you a voice\u201d. \u201cSo using it in ways that are helpful and supportive to others \u2013 it sounds naff but it\u2019s genuine \u2013 that\u2019s the balance for me,\u201d she says. Recently she\u2019s been using her voice to bring attention to the plight of migrants. Like many people she was deeply upset by the photograph of Alan Kurdi, the young Syrian boy found dead on a Turkish beach, that was taken in September 2015. She wanted to do something and got involved with the International Rescue Committee, visited migrant centres in Lesbos, where she befriended a Syrian family of refugees now relocated in northern Germany. It\u2019s a concern that also led to her appearing in a low-budget British feature film called The Flood, which was made by three people who had worked as volunteers at the Calais \u201cjungle\u201d \u2013 director Anthony Woodley, writer Helen Kingston, and producer Luke Healy. The film-makers wanted to open up a dialogue around the refugee/migrant debate that acknowledged the complexity and emotions on both sides of the issue. Headey plays a rather cold and officious civil servant assessing asylum claims at a refugee centre in England. Her character is also going through a difficult divorce, separation from her child, and is drinking too much. It\u2019s an understated performance, delivered in flat Yorkshire tones, a portrait of an emotionally vulnerable woman hiding under a harsh exterior. After rejecting one Eritrean claimant, she has second thoughts and goes against her number-crunching boss (Iain Glen, also of Game of Thrones) to come to the refugee\u2019s aid. It\u2019s about as far from high production values and every other Game of Thrones value as you could get. Headey was attracted to the change in scale. \u201cI sort of grew up in the small British film industry,\u201d she says, \u201cback when films were made for no money by people who felt passionate about their projects, and were shot in a really small space of time. And I missed that way of film-making.\u201d The film was actually made three years ago but has been sitting around waiting for a release spot. The delay, she says, was because another film about refugees had already been released, so the film industry, in her scathing phrase, had \u201cfulfilled its quota\u201d on the issue. \u201cIt\u2019s not a cool thing to talk about,\u201d she says of the refugee crisis. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of ugly. And sort of unfathomable. But when are we going to realise we need to find something that works?\u201d At the same time she acknowledges that it\u2019s a complex subject that can\u2019t easily be reduced to simple answers, noting, as the film does, that gangsters and criminals conceal themselves among and exploit genuine refugees. Nonetheless she thinks Germany has risen far more impressively to the challenge of the refugee crisis than the UK, which she says has neglected its moral and international obligations to unaccompanied minors. She has witnessed on a previous visit how differently things are done in Berlin. This time round she\u2019s in the German capital making an action film called \u2013 Nigel Farage beware! \u2013 Gunpowder Milkshake. It involves a band of female assassins and features Angela Bassett. Headey says she is enjoying the fun of physical exertion, but while she\u2019s done plenty of action and horror films, they don\u2019t reflect her own taste in film-making. For many years she\u2019s been nurturing an ambition to move to the other side of the camera. She\u2019s carefully studied how directors construct scenes and advise actors.

Ever.\u201d The Trap is a remarkably accomplished piece of work that features some gripping naturalistic performances from several actors, including the wonderful Michelle Fairley, yet another Game of Thrones colleague. The writing is crisp, spare and shot through with bristling repressed emotions. Headey\u2019s great cinematic hero, her \u201cnorth star of directing\u201d, is Shane Meadows, whose extraordinary four-part TV drama The Virtues recently concluded, having explored emotional depths that few drama writers would even consider attempting to reach. \u201cHe pulls you in and you\u2019re kind of giggling and then you realise that you\u2019re part of something really dark,\u201d she says approvingly of Meadows. Without giving anything away about the plot, it would be fair to say that, though only 30 minutes long, The Trap perfectly fulfils that brief. Amazingly, after the nine-year hiatus, the shooting took only four days \u2013 almost as quick as the writing. \u201cIt was a small crew moving at pace.\u201d She says her philosophy as a film-maker involves creating an environment in which everyone is heard and everyone loves what they\u2019re doing.

Every six months, she says, she gets a \u201cjones\u201d for a new tattoo. \u201cIt resets me,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s like a ritual.\u201d She doesn\u2019t know what the next one will be yet, but what usually happens is that she\u2019ll have the seed of an idea and then she\u2019ll start to obsess about it until she can find someone to do it. Her girlfriends often tell her that she\u2019s gone too far, but she\u2019s not put off by that. What troubles her is when her tattoos are covered up for filming. \u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s weird, I don\u2019t feel whole.\u201d Only her most devoted fans are likely to notice her next tattoo, but her directorial debut is well worth catching. Forget the Iron Throne. The seat of her true destiny may well turn out to be the director\u2019s chair. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 and 19 June 2019: to correct the location where the body of drowned child migrant Alan Kurdi was found and famously photographed in 2015 \u2013 it was a beach near Bodrum, Turkey \u2013 and to remove a reference to refugee camp funding.

      "bodyText": "Thank you very much for your company this afternoon. I\u2019m going to settle back, pour myself something cold and enjoy the familiar sight of Mancunian clouds making people furious. Here is that liveblog, helmed by Tim de Lisle for starters. Join him. Cricket: Just a little reminder before I sign off that tonight\u2019s cricket promises to be one of the sporting spectacles of the year - India vs Pakistan in the World Cup. You can follow all the action on The Guardian\u2019s over-by-over coverage from 6.30pm. State of Origin: Oof! Some big news has just dropped with the announcement of the squads for the second instalment of this year\u2019s State of Origin. Brad Fittler has made SEVEN changes to his Blues for game two over at Optus Stadium in Perth. Daniel Saifiti (Newcastle Knights) and Dale Finucane (Melbourne Storm) will make their debuts, while James Maloney (2018), Tom Trbojevic (2018), Tariq Sims (2018), Blake Ferguson (2017) and Wade Graham (2017) have all been recalled. There\u2019s no place for under-fire Latrell Mitchell despite his double try-scoring performance for the Roosters earlier today. Queensland are forced into two changes with Joe Ofahengaue and Jai Arrow both unavailable due to injury. Tim Glasby and Jarrod Wallace come into the 17 in their places. Christian Welch, Edrick Lee and Corey Norman will also join Camp Maroon this week as part of the extended squad. North Melbourne\u2019s spirited performance wasn\u2019t enough in the end as the Giants scrapped their way to second place on the ladder at Blundstone Arena. There was nothing between the sides at the main break but the class of GWS told in the second half with Josh Kelly, Tim Taranto and Stephen Congilio running all over the Kangaroos in chilly conditions. This fixture always loomed as a perfect opportunity for the Roosters to regain their mojo and so it proved with the hapless Bulldogs bulldozed at the SCG. Not only did the Roosters snap their three-game losing streak but they also saw Latrell Mitchell return to form with a two-try five-goal outing. The only downside was a late Bulldogs try denying the Roosters second place on the ladder by points difference but they still leapfrog the Raiders into third. Cricket World Cup: This World Cup has been fun but the English rain and the interminable group phase means it hasn\u2019t yet come to the boil. That could all change in a couple of hours with the recommencement of perhaps the biggest rivalry in world sport - India vs Pakistan. Let\u2019s hope the skies over Manchester have cleared and the puddles on the Old Trafford outfield have dried to allow this blockbuster to go ahead. NRL: 60 mins: Roosters 24-6 Bulldogs - The Roosters are still well in control of the two points late on against the Bulldogs at the SCG. Drew Hutchison crossed shortly after half-time to put the result beyond doubt. Swoon. AFL: 3QT: North Melbourne 8.6 (54) v GWS 11.6 (72) - Still all to play for at Blundstone Arena but the class of GWS\u2019s silky midfielders is finally beginning to tell. Josh Kelly, Tim Taranto, and Stephen Coniglio are the leading ball-winners and they each have at least one goal to their credit for good measure. They\u2019ve needed to step up because North Melbourne\u2019s defenders are putting in a superb shift to keep the Giants\u2019s storied tall forward line quiet. Cricket World Cup: Australia moved to the top of the Cricket World Cup group phase table with victory over Sri Lanka last night but questions remain over strategy and selection after another flawed performance. Aaron Finch\u2019s innings was a beauty though and worth finding on replay. His timing in the V early on was textbook then his power towards the end was brutal. Good grief! What a finish in the Super Netball! The ladder-leading Swifts cemented their status as the team to beat in this year\u2019s competition with a thrilling comeback win over crosstown rivals the Giants, their second of the season. The Swifts trailed for long periods but stormed back in the second half to snatch a late victory and extend their lead in top spot to ten points. Sam Wallace finished with 48 goals from 50 shots, backed up by Helen Housby\u2019s 11 from 12 and game-high 23 assists. Behind them goalkeeper Sarah Klau starred with four intercepts and she was integral to getting her side back into the contest in the third quarter when they were down by five points. Swifts coach Briony Akle reserved praise for English star Housby who stepped up when it counted in a side that was missing some key players including captain Maddy Proud. \u201cWe always knew we were going to have to get the ball to the players who had been around for a bit longer with some girls missing, and she really stood up today for us especially at the end when we really needed it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a work in progress all week and we just had to tell ourselves that we were going to be okay without Maddy despite what the outside voices were saying and Helen was a key part of that.\u201d The Swifts will travel to Adelaide next weekend to play the seventh-placed Thunderbirds, while the Giants will look to regroup for the match in Sydney on Saturday night against the third-placed Melbourne Vixens in what looms as a must-win game. With AAP. NRL: HT: Roosters 16-6 Bulldogs - No surprises at the SCG with the Roosters using their afternoon outing against the bottom-placed Bulldogs to find some form after three matches without a win. The returning Latrell Mitchell answered his critics with a comeback try after just eight minutes before Joseph Manu and Sitili Tupouniua crossed to hand the fourth-placed side a 16-point lead. Will Hopoate bulldozed his way over to reduce the deficit before half-time but the Roosters are looking good for a return to third spot on the ladder. AFL: How Australian sporting competitions manage their crowds is becoming a hot topic of debate following the AFL\u2019s crackdown on antisocial behaviour. A string of fist fights filmed by social media has spurred AFL bosses into action but supporters and commentators are now concerned the response is too heavy handed. Marvel Stadium management will review security procedures after the AFLvenue\u2019s chief executive Michael Green conceded some fans felt intimidated by the more-visible security presence. With crowd behaviour in the spotlight in recent weeks, stadium management beefed up patrolling of the aisles by guards but the increased presence has caused a fan backlash. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly something that we\u2019ll need to review and try to come up with the right balance because we clearly haven\u2019t got it right at the moment,\u201d Green told SEN on Sunday. NBA: I confess to knowing little about the NBA but I\u2019m not blind to the significance of this \u201cWoj Bomb\u201d of a trade story. Super Netball: 3QT: Swifts 42-43 Giants - A thrilling final quarter is in store for the Sydney derby in Super Netball with the Swifts winning their first bonus point of the match to reduce the deficit to the Giants to just one goal. Sam Wallace is emerging as the dominant force on court for the ladder leaders. AFL: HT: North Melbourne 7.3 (45) v GWS 7.3 (45) - It\u2019s still anyone\u2019s game at half-time at Blundstone Arena. Supercars: Scott McLaughlin has ended a 13-year wait with a thumping win to become the first Supercars driver to win the Triple Crown in Darwin. DJR Team Penske star McLaughlin enjoyed a flawless weekend in the Top End after winning both races from pole and the top-10 shootout in his Ford Mustang. No driver had completed the trifecta since its inception in 2006. McLaughlin also drew level with legend Peter Brock to sit equal-second on the list of career pole positions (57). From AAP. This is fun. Ryan Pierse is a brilliant photographer and his incredible shots are enhanced by his commentary of the planning and technique that went into creating them. Women\u2019s World Cup: Plenty still going on in France as sides jostle for spots in the last 16. Australia\u2019s Matildas are back in action during the early hours of Wednesday morning when they\u2019ll be looking for a result against Jamaica that not only secures them the three points they need to reach the knockout phase but also provides enough of a goal difference boost to improve their path to the latter stages. Super Netball: HT: Swifts 27-30 Giants - There\u2019s still little separating these crosstown rivals and finals bound sides in the last Super Netball match of the round. Both goal shooters are operating at 100% efficiency in a high quality contest. Manly superstar Tom Trbojevic has starred in the Sea Eagles\u2019 34-14 NRL demolition of St George Illawarra to seal his return to the NSW State of Origin side. Des Hasler\u2019s side scored 34 unanswered points on Sunday to inflict further pain on the Dragons. They have lost six of their past seven games to leave them stagnating heading into the representative-round break. The Dragons dominated early possession to open up an 8-0 lead but, when Jack Gosiewski burrowed over seven minutes after halftime, the home side led 16-8. No.1 Trbojevic imposed himself on the game at Lottoland, erasing any concerns about his troublesome hamstring which had kept him out for most of the year. First, he pierced through the Dragons\u2019 line and Cade Cust crossed from the next play. Five minutes later, he caught out some lazy defence around the ruck to send Mainese Fainu over. Then he did it all himself, cleaning up a Corey Norman grubber and running 70 metres to cap a memorable performance. In what was just just second game back from injury, he finished with 333 metres, one try assist, two line breaks, two line-break assists, 11 tackle busts and five offloads to announce he was back to his best. He looks certain to be named in the NSW side for Origin two as a replacement for injured winger Nick Cotric. From AAP. AFL: QT: North Melbourne 3.0 (18) v GWS 3.2 (20) - Not much to separate the two sides in Hobart as the Giants bid to climb second on the ladder and the Kangaroos battle to keep their finals hopes alive. Super Netball: QT: Swifts 13-13 Giants - Even stevens at quarter time in the NSW derby. The Swifts are looking to extend their lead on top of the ladder, the Giants to secure that fourth and final playoff position. NRL: Some big State of Origin news today with injuries ruling Mitchell Pearce out of making his Origin return for the Blues. The NSW comeback of Mitchell Pearce is over before it even began with the halfback ruled out of contention for State of Origin Game 2 due to injury. The Newcastle Knights player was widely tipped to be recalled for the Blues for next Sunday\u2019s must-win game in Perth but the 30-year-old has succumbed to hip and groin complaints. NSW coach Brad Fittler revealed Pearce had phoned him on Sunday morning \u2013 just hours before the Game 2 team would be revealed \u2013 to rule himself out. NRL: 60 mins: Sea Eagles 28-8 Dragons - That early Dragons lead is a distant memory now with the Sea Eagles storming home at Brookvale Oval. Jack Gosiewski, Cade Cust, and Manase Fainu have all crossed in the second half. Golf: Brooks Koepka is not out of the running to secure a hat-trick of US Open titles but big-hitting Gary Woodland continues to lead the field at Pebble Beach with 18 hols remaining. Victory at Pebble Beach on Sunday would render Koepka only the second player, and first since 1905, to win this major in three consecutive years. Through 54 holes, Koepka \u2013 who makes a point of deriving inspiration from negative forces, real or otherwise \u2013 trails Woodland\u2019s 11 under par by four. The scale of Koepka\u2019s potential triumph should not be overstated; victory in this US Open would represent a fifth in just nine major starts. Boxing: Tyson Fury remains the lineal heavyweight champion of the world following a second round stoppage against Tom Schwarz in Las Vegas. Fury dominated from the outset, showing incredible footwork and fast hands to school his young opponent and raise expectations ahead of a rematch with Deontay Wilder. NRL: 43 mins: Sea Eagles 10-8 Dragons - We\u2019re just into the second half at Brookvale Oval where Manly have recovered from an early eight point deficit to sneak ahead of St George Illawarra. Ben Hunt\u2019s early try was cancelled out by Reuben Garrick and Dylan Walker to keep the home side on course for two points that will cement their status as top eight contenders. The Firebirds remain winless after eight rounds of the Super Netball season as the Vixens continued their march to the finals at Queensland State Netball Centre. Under the watchful eye of Diamonds coach Lisa Alexander the Vixens rallied from losing the opening two quarters to smash their hosts in the third, outscoring them 19-9 to surge into a lead they never looked like relinquishing. The visitors changed their defensive structure and were a different team after the long break, led by star goalkeeper Emily Mannix who enjoyed a game-high five interceptions. Caitlin Thwaites top scored for Melbourne with 42 goals from 46 shots in a performance bolstered by six offensive rebounds. Tegan Philip chipped in in with 29 from 34. Along with the Swifts and Lightning the Vixens are part of a three team breakaway at the top of the ladder halfway through the regular season. The Firebirds are not out of the running for that fourth and final playoff spot but they will require a miraculous run home to feature in September. With AAP. Hello everybody and welcome to another edition of Sunday Sportwatch. On the agenda today we have live Super Netball, NRL and AFL, along with a smorgasbord of results and news from around the sporting world. We\u2019ll begin by catching up with the Super Netball fixture between the Firebirds and Vixens that has just concluded, swiftly rolling into the second match of the day between the Swifts and Giants that has just got underway. The opening NRL contest between the Sea Eagles and the Dragons is at the halfway mark, a battle followed at 4pm by the Roosters and Bulldogs. There\u2019s only one AFL outing to keep an eye on during this quiet bye round and that gets underway at 3.20pm when North Melbourne welcome GWS to Hobart. If that wasn\u2019t enough there\u2019s the men\u2019s cricket and women\u2019s football world cups to catch up on, moving day in the US Open golf, a heavyweight title fight and plenty more besides. If you\u2019d like to join in the conversation you can find me on Twitter - @JPHowcroft- or feel free to drop me an email - jonathan.howcroft.freelance@theguardian.com. Talk to me about today\u2019s action or whatever\u2019s on your mind really. I\u2019m here for the afternoon on my lonesome so any distraction from my hyperactive internal monologue is welcome. For example, anyone who\u2019s seen the new Maradona documentary that was released on Friday, I am happy to take movie reviews of any length. I cannot wait to see it.",

      "body": "<p>Perhaps we should have a robot prime minister. What do you think? It might be worth a go. Has technology advanced to the extent that some computer-centred entity could fail to do all the things Theresa May has failed to do almost as comprehensively? It\u2019s possible. It might even fail to do them more quickly and efficiently \u2013 by which I mean succeed in accomplishing that failure more quickly and efficiently.</p> <p>Then again, to give May a bit of credit, the comparatively slow rate at which she failed to achieve any of her goals was the most commendable aspect of her premiership. Her order of preference was probably: succeed quickly; succeed slowly; fail slowly; fail quickly. She got her third choice \u2013 like so much of the electorate \u2013 and hence she\u2019s been prime minister for a reasonably long time. So it wouldn\u2019t be fair to conclude that her robot equivalent was better merely because it managed to reach her current nadir of non-success in, say, 0.37 seconds rather than two years and 11 months.</p> <p>I could imagine it working reasonably well, though \u2013 particularly if the big policy decisions continue to be pre-ordained by referendum. We\u2019re just looking for someone, or something, to deal with all the unpalatable details, so perhaps it\u2019s easier if they literally don\u2019t have a palate: just some artificial intelligence software running on a MacBook Pro, cable-tied to the top of a kind of motorised trolley that it can move around for itself.</p> <p>Or on legs, I suppose, if the public can relate to them better. Though I suspect that would be a bit of a challenge in terms of processing power. Have you seen any of the various clips of robots trying to walk across uneven ground? It\u2019s really pathetic \u2013 it makes Vince Cable look sprightly. You wouldn\u2019t want the PM to forget all the details of the withdrawal agreement every time it had to negotiate a gravel path. Think of Chequers \u2013 it\u2019s Grade I listed, so I don\u2019t think you can just concrete the whole garden.</p> <p>Of course there\u2019ll be problems \u2013 we\u2019re not going to get perfect government, but then we never do with humans either. But the great advantage of a robot prime minister is that, when its government inevitably lets everyone down and collapses, it could be publicly smashed to bits to assuage the nation\u2019s rage.</p> <p>Let me be clear, I am not in favour of former prime ministers, however disappointing, being publicly smashed to bits. I think any sort of lynching is wrong. That\u2019s the sort of snowflake you\u2019re dealing with here. I even think what happened to Mussolini was a bit much. But it would be different with a robot, because it would all be backed up in the Cloud anyway, which was not the case with Mussolini, except according to the most rabidly pro-fascist conceptions of celestial reward.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In Sweden, a robot called Tengai can apparently nod, smile, wink and say sorry. Theresa May can barely do half that</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>You may be wondering what got me thinking about a new kind of prime minister you can take a sledgehammer to without ethical consequences. Well, the issue of whether robots can supplant humans has been in the news a lot. Tye Brady, chief robotics technologist at Amazon Robotics, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-48590628\" title=\"\">told the BBC the other day</a> that Amazon\u2019s warehouses will never be able to completely dispense with human workers. The firm currently has 200,000 robots on its no-payroll, but there\u2019ll always be some people too, he reckons \u2013 in the same way that the army still keeps quite a lot of horses, I suppose.</p> <p>The army\u2019s horses get pretty well treated these days, ever since the tactic of galloping towards machine guns was conclusively proven to be militarily ineffective. But if Tim Roache, general secretary of the trade union GMB, is to be believed, Amazon\u2019s treatment of people is contrastingly harsh: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-48590628\" title=\"\">They are breaking bones</a>, being knocked unconscious and being taken away in ambulances\u201d, was how he described warehouse working conditions last November. \u201cWe\u2019re standing up and saying enough is enough\u2026 they\u2019re not robots.\u201d</p> <p>Not all of them, anyway.</p> <p>But what will the remaining humans be doing, assuming Amazon\u2019s robotic development continues apace? Designing new robots? Bossing all the robots around? Maybe, but also, according to the BBC: \u201cOne task robots still struggle greatly with is picking up individual objects of varying shapes and standards \u2013 which is still a key job of the human worker.\u201d</p> <p>Horses find that tricky as well.</p> <p>So it\u2019s not necessarily what you\u2019d class as the higher-skilled tasks that will be reserved for humans in the robotic future. Walking over uneven ground and picking up knobbly objects may be the last things we\u2019re still best at. In Sweden, they\u2019ve developed a robot that can interview people for jobs (though as more jobs start being done by robots, it could find itself in a fax machine-style technological cul-de-sac).</p> <p>This machine, called <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-47442953\" title=\"\">Tengai</a>, can apparently interact in a human way \u2013 it can nod, smile, wink and say sorry.

      "bodyText": "Perhaps we should have a robot prime minister. What do you think? It might be worth a go. Has technology advanced to the extent that some computer-centred entity could fail to do all the things Theresa May has failed to do almost as comprehensively? It\u2019s possible. It might even fail to do them more quickly and efficiently \u2013 by which I mean succeed in accomplishing that failure more quickly and efficiently. Then again, to give May a bit of credit, the comparatively slow rate at which she failed to achieve any of her goals was the most commendable aspect of her premiership. Her order of preference was probably: succeed quickly; succeed slowly; fail slowly; fail quickly. She got her third choice \u2013 like so much of the electorate \u2013 and hence she\u2019s been prime minister for a reasonably long time. So it wouldn\u2019t be fair to conclude that her robot equivalent was better merely because it managed to reach her current nadir of non-success in, say, 0.37 seconds rather than two years and 11 months. I could imagine it working reasonably well, though \u2013 particularly if the big policy decisions continue to be pre-ordained by referendum. We\u2019re just looking for someone, or something, to deal with all the unpalatable details, so perhaps it\u2019s easier if they literally don\u2019t have a palate: just some artificial intelligence software running on a MacBook Pro, cable-tied to the top of a kind of motorised trolley that it can move around for itself. Or on legs, I suppose, if the public can relate to them better. Though I suspect that would be a bit of a challenge in terms of processing power. Have you seen any of the various clips of robots trying to walk across uneven ground? It\u2019s really pathetic \u2013 it makes Vince Cable look sprightly. You wouldn\u2019t want the PM to forget all the details of the withdrawal agreement every time it had to negotiate a gravel path. Think of Chequers \u2013 it\u2019s Grade I listed, so I don\u2019t think you can just concrete the whole garden. Of course there\u2019ll be problems \u2013 we\u2019re not going to get perfect government, but then we never do with humans either. But the great advantage of a robot prime minister is that, when its government inevitably lets everyone down and collapses, it could be publicly smashed to bits to assuage the nation\u2019s rage. Let me be clear, I am not in favour of former prime ministers, however disappointing, being publicly smashed to bits. I think any sort of lynching is wrong. That\u2019s the sort of snowflake you\u2019re dealing with here. I even think what happened to Mussolini was a bit much. But it would be different with a robot, because it would all be backed up in the Cloud anyway, which was not the case with Mussolini, except according to the most rabidly pro-fascist conceptions of celestial reward. You may be wondering what got me thinking about a new kind of prime minister you can take a sledgehammer to without ethical consequences. Well, the issue of whether robots can supplant humans has been in the news a lot. Tye Brady, chief robotics technologist at Amazon Robotics, told the BBC the other day that Amazon\u2019s warehouses will never be able to completely dispense with human workers. The firm currently has 200,000 robots on its no-payroll, but there\u2019ll always be some people too, he reckons \u2013 in the same way that the army still keeps quite a lot of horses, I suppose. The army\u2019s horses get pretty well treated these days, ever since the tactic of galloping towards machine guns was conclusively proven to be militarily ineffective. But if Tim Roache, general secretary of the trade union GMB, is to be believed, Amazon\u2019s treatment of people is contrastingly harsh: \u201cThey are breaking bones, being knocked unconscious and being taken away in ambulances\u201d, was how he described warehouse working conditions last November. \u201cWe\u2019re standing up and saying enough is enough\u2026 they\u2019re not robots.\u201d Not all of them, anyway. But what will the remaining humans be doing, assuming Amazon\u2019s robotic development continues apace? Designing new robots? Bossing all the robots around? Maybe, but also, according to the BBC: \u201cOne task robots still struggle greatly with is picking up individual objects of varying shapes and standards \u2013 which is still a key job of the human worker.\u201d Horses find that tricky as well. So it\u2019s not necessarily what you\u2019d class as the higher-skilled tasks that will be reserved for humans in the robotic future. Walking over uneven ground and picking up knobbly objects may be the last things we\u2019re still best at. In Sweden, they\u2019ve developed a robot that can interview people for jobs (though as more jobs start being done by robots, it could find itself in a fax machine-style technological cul-de-sac). This machine, called Tengai, can apparently interact in a human way \u2013 it can nod, smile, wink and say sorry. Theresa May can barely do half that. And, unlike many human interviewers, it will not discriminate on the basis of gender, ethnicity, religion, background or appearance. The 124,000 members of the Conservative party, the de facto interview panel for the most important job in the country, are unlikely to be so rational. These people once elected Iain Duncan Smith \u2013 it\u2019s as if they\u2019re part of an elaborate experiment aimed at undermining the notion of the wisdom of crowds. Another important post that needs filling at the moment is that of controller of Radio 4. One of the shortlisted applicants, Cassian Harrison, who confusingly is currently in charge of BBC Four (TV numbering), last year used an AI algorithm to select archive programmes for his channel\u2019s schedule. I think that makes him the diametric opposite of a luddite \u2013 he\u2019s embracing the approaching obsolescence of human input in his own line of work. This interview process would be an interesting test of Tengai\u2019s impartiality. Would it, as programmed, resist favouring a candidate who so enthusiastically supports its robot colleagues?

Official figures showed that the time between a case being given to prosecutors and a decision to charge increased by 140% between 2010 and 2017. The government has said that the average number of days until a charge is made has risen from 32 in 2010-2011 to 78 in 2017-2018. Shami Chakrabarti, the shadow attorney general, said that this showed \u201cshameful treatment of survivors\u2019 human rights\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOf course decisions should be considered carefully by the Crown Prosecution Service, but such a long wait for a decision to charge reveals an entire system paralysed by self-doubt,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is bad news for complainants and defendants, and for the quality of justice.\u201d</p> <p>In response, the CPS said: \u201cThe huge growth in digital evidence \u2013 as well as making sure we are properly sharing all relevant material with the defence \u2013 means some cases are taking longer to charge. We understand that timeliness is important for everyone concerned and we will consider this as part of the cross-government review into how the criminal justice system deals with rape complaints.\u201d</p> <p>Rebecca (not her real name) says that she was attacked after accepting a lift from a man in the early hours of a February morning in 2017. Shocked, she did not report the attack for 10 months, something the CPS argued was a significant factor in its decision to drop the prosecution.</p> <p>In a letter to Rebecca after she requested a victim\u2019s right to review, the CPS said: \u201cA defence barrister could \u2026 suggest that the delay in reporting the allegation for such an articulate and assertive individual as you is puzzling.\u201d</p> <p>The response left her stunned. \u201cThe reason I was assertive and eloquent was because I waited a long time to process what had happened before reporting,\u201d she told the <em>Observer</em>.</p> <p>The CPS letter also said that a defence barrister could suggest that the amount she had drunk affected her recall. She disputes this: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have gotten a rape kit done the next day if I had any doubts.\u201d</p> <p>The letter said that the barrister could claim that her \u201crefusal to cooperate [might] suggest you were not being entirely open\u201d. This is a reference to Rebecca\u2019s early reluctance to hand over her mobile phone and full medical records, which the investigating detective constable initially told her was mandatory.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason for that whatsoever [handing over her full medical history]. I\u2019ve had an eating disorder in the past which they could reframe as mental instability,\u201d Rebecca said.</p> <p>Earlier this year there was an outcry when the CPS confirmed that it had begun to use police consent forms that asked complainants for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/29/new-police-disclosure-consent-forms-could-free-rape-suspects\" title=\"\">permission to look at their mobile phones,</a> warning that refusal might jeopardise a prosecution.

      "bodyText": "A rape complainant was told by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) that her delay in reporting her alleged assault, her articulacy and her assertiveness were factors in its decision not to prosecute the man she said had attacked her. The explanation is given in a 2017 letter to the woman from the CPS, seen by the Observer, explaining its decision not to bring a case against the man despite initially charging him on the grounds that there was \u201creasonable suspicion he had committed rape\u201d. The letter, which sets out a series of concerns about how the woman would be portrayed by the alleged attacker\u2019s defence team, will reinforce concerns that the CPS is trying to second-guess how juries will behave. Last week it was reported that the CPS is to face a judicial review challenge over an alleged change in policy that is being blamed for a dramatic collapse in the number of rape cases going to court. This weekend it also emerged that there has been an increase in the amount of time it takes for a suspect to be charged over a suspected rape. Official figures showed that the time between a case being given to prosecutors and a decision to charge increased by 140% between 2010 and 2017. The government has said that the average number of days until a charge is made has risen from 32 in 2010-2011 to 78 in 2017-2018. Shami Chakrabarti, the shadow attorney general, said that this showed \u201cshameful treatment of survivors\u2019 human rights\u201d. \u201cOf course decisions should be considered carefully by the Crown Prosecution Service, but such a long wait for a decision to charge reveals an entire system paralysed by self-doubt,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is bad news for complainants and defendants, and for the quality of justice.\u201d In response, the CPS said: \u201cThe huge growth in digital evidence \u2013 as well as making sure we are properly sharing all relevant material with the defence \u2013 means some cases are taking longer to charge. We understand that timeliness is important for everyone concerned and we will consider this as part of the cross-government review into how the criminal justice system deals with rape complaints.\u201d Rebecca (not her real name) says that she was attacked after accepting a lift from a man in the early hours of a February morning in 2017. Shocked, she did not report the attack for 10 months, something the CPS argued was a significant factor in its decision to drop the prosecution. In a letter to Rebecca after she requested a victim\u2019s right to review, the CPS said: \u201cA defence barrister could \u2026 suggest that the delay in reporting the allegation for such an articulate and assertive individual as you is puzzling.\u201d The response left her stunned. \u201cThe reason I was assertive and eloquent was because I waited a long time to process what had happened before reporting,\u201d she told the Observer. The CPS letter also said that a defence barrister could suggest that the amount she had drunk affected her recall. She disputes this: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have gotten a rape kit done the next day if I had any doubts.\u201d The letter said that the barrister could claim that her \u201crefusal to cooperate [might] suggest you were not being entirely open\u201d. This is a reference to Rebecca\u2019s early reluctance to hand over her mobile phone and full medical records, which the investigating detective constable initially told her was mandatory. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for that whatsoever [handing over her full medical history]. I\u2019ve had an eating disorder in the past which they could reframe as mental instability,\u201d Rebecca said. Earlier this year there was an outcry when the CPS confirmed that it had begun to use police consent forms that asked complainants for permission to look at their mobile phones, warning that refusal might jeopardise a prosecution. This followed the collapse of several rape cases when it emerged that there had been mobile phone contact between complainants and their alleged assailants. Rebecca was confused by the order to hand over her phone. Both she and her assailant said that they had never communicated. Two years after her attack, Rebecca worries that women will be reluctant to report rape. \u201cUltimately there was nothing to prove I did not consent,\u201d she said. \u201cI very much made the report thinking that if some other girl reports something in the future, there\u2019ll at least be a little red flag showing he\u2019s got previous. But what pissed me off was how they handled all of the evidence-gathering.\u201d A spokesman for the CPS said: \u201cAll rape and serious sexual offences prosecutors receive training on myths and stereotypes to ensure they do not influence our decision-making. \u201cBalancing the rights of both a complainant and a suspect means that all reasonable lines of inquiry must be pursued.

      "body": "<p>Hong Kong has become a place whose present is unresolved and whose future is unimaginable. After the unexpected violence of the last week, no one can predict how the events of this afternoon, tomorrow, this week will play out. The only certainty is that Hong Kong\u2019s way of life is under immediate threat and its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/10/what-are-the-hong-kong-protests-about-explainer\" title=\"\">people are coming out</a> in force to defend it.</p> <p>But the curse of living in the eternal immediate present is that the stakes for this \u201clast fight\u201d could not be higher, especially since young Hong Kongers fear that if they are defeated in this battle, there will be nothing left to lose. The failure of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/30/-sp-hong-kong-umbrella-revolution-pro-democracy-protests\" title=\"\">Umbrella movement</a> five years ago, when Hong Kongers occupied important thoroughfares for 79 days, seeking greater democratic participation, to win any concrete gains has raised the stakes further still this time round.</p> <p>\u201cHK is not China! Not yet!\u201d These few words hastily scrawled on to a piece of A4 paper and tacked on to the concrete strut of a walkway aptly encapsulate the political crisis roiling Hong Kong. The territory has been plunged into instability after police fired rubber bullets and 150 rounds of teargas to break up a huge rally on 12 June, just days after a million people peacefully took to the streets to protest against extradition legislation.</p> <p>\u201cNot yet\u201d is a reference to the terms of the joint declaration governing Hong Kong\u2019s return to Chinese rule in 1997, which promised that the territory\u2019s way of life would remain unchanged for 50 years, until 2047. When it was signed, in 1984, the year 2047 seemed impossibly far off, but the proposed extradition law brings 2047 much, much closer.</p> <p>By permitting the rendition of anyone on Hong Kong soil to face trial in China, it would effectively remove the firewall between Hong Kong\u2019s common law system and the mainland\u2019s party-dominated legal system. Though the government has now suspended the bill, the process has unleashed a firestorm of fear and anger.</p> <p>Since the Umbrella movement, Hong Kongers have already seen irrevocable changes to their way of life: popularly elected <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/14/hong-kong-pro-democracy-legislators-disqualified-parliament\" title=\"\">lawmakers have been disqualified</a> by the courts for saying their oaths too slowly or with the wrong intonation; politicians have been forbidden to stand for election; a political <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/24/hong-kong-bans-pro-independence-party-as-china-tightens-grip\" title=\"\">party has been banned</a>; activists have been sent to prison on public-order offences; now the police have used violence against their own people.</p> <p>The unseemly rush to pass this unpopular extradition law has also weakened each of the territory\u2019s institutions.

      "bodyText": "Hong Kong has become a place whose present is unresolved and whose future is unimaginable. After the unexpected violence of the last week, no one can predict how the events of this afternoon, tomorrow, this week will play out. The only certainty is that Hong Kong\u2019s way of life is under immediate threat and its people are coming out in force to defend it. But the curse of living in the eternal immediate present is that the stakes for this \u201clast fight\u201d could not be higher, especially since young Hong Kongers fear that if they are defeated in this battle, there will be nothing left to lose. The failure of the Umbrella movement five years ago, when Hong Kongers occupied important thoroughfares for 79 days, seeking greater democratic participation, to win any concrete gains has raised the stakes further still this time round. \u201cHK is not China! Not yet!\u201d These few words hastily scrawled on to a piece of A4 paper and tacked on to the concrete strut of a walkway aptly encapsulate the political crisis roiling Hong Kong. The territory has been plunged into instability after police fired rubber bullets and 150 rounds of teargas to break up a huge rally on 12 June, just days after a million people peacefully took to the streets to protest against extradition legislation. \u201cNot yet\u201d is a reference to the terms of the joint declaration governing Hong Kong\u2019s return to Chinese rule in 1997, which promised that the territory\u2019s way of life would remain unchanged for 50 years, until 2047. When it was signed, in 1984, the year 2047 seemed impossibly far off, but the proposed extradition law brings 2047 much, much closer. By permitting the rendition of anyone on Hong Kong soil to face trial in China, it would effectively remove the firewall between Hong Kong\u2019s common law system and the mainland\u2019s party-dominated legal system. Though the government has now suspended the bill, the process has unleashed a firestorm of fear and anger. Since the Umbrella movement, Hong Kongers have already seen irrevocable changes to their way of life: popularly elected lawmakers have been disqualified by the courts for saying their oaths too slowly or with the wrong intonation; politicians have been forbidden to stand for election; a political party has been banned; activists have been sent to prison on public-order offences; now the police have used violence against their own people. The unseemly rush to pass this unpopular extradition law has also weakened each of the territory\u2019s institutions. The legislature descended into unseemly brawls, with fist fights breaking out as committees duelled. The civil service and judiciary are no longer seen as politically neutral. The police force, once seen as Asia\u2019s finest, is an object of popular hatred, and its relationship with the public is irretrievably damaged. The chief executive, Carrie Lam, is so unpopular that protesters carried pictures of her face stamped with the word \u201cLiar\u201d and 6,000 mothers turned out to accuse her of not being fit for office. Even though the bill has been put on hold, the process has already permanently devalued the institutions that HK people hold dear. Hong Kong\u2019s status as a city of protest is also under threat. The ability to demonstrate has become an important expression of local identity that distinguishes Hong Kong from China and over the years Hong Kongers have enthusiastically marched with performative flair, mounting shopping actions, carol singing rallies and artistic protests against censorship with blank placards. Yet the designation of Wednesday\u2019s protest as a riot, combined with court verdicts finding activists guilty on public nuisance charges, strike at the very heart of the ability to stage a protest. Today, any call to public action, even the act of giving speeches to a rally, requires a greater degree of caution.

      "body": "<p>It was a winter evening at a hospital just outside London and colorectal surgeon David Sellu\u2019s clinic was busy. But when a fellow doctor, an orthopaedic surgeon, asked him if he would see one of his patients, Sellu didn\u2019t hesitate to say yes. Which is how, an hour or so later, he came to meet the man whose death would turn him into a criminal serving 15 months in a prison cell.</p> <p>His new patient was a 66-year-old who had recently had a knee replacement, but was now complaining of abdominal pain. In <em>Did He Save Lives?</em>, the book that documents his story, Sellu recalls shaking hands with the man, James Hughes, a retired builder from Northern Ireland, and sitting by his bed to talk about how he was feeling. Sellu, now in his early 70s, speaks quietly and precisely. It\u2019s easy to imagine him on that evening nine years ago, pulling up a chair and explaining to Hughes that he\u2019d need painkillers to get him through the night and an urgent CT scan in the morning.</p> <p>That scan showed Hughes had a perforated bowel and would need surgery straight away. Sellu tried to book an operating slot, but the earliest he could secure a theatre and anaesthetist at the hospital, the private Clementine Churchill in Harrow, was for later that evening. At the last minute, however, the anaesthetist was delayed with another case. Sellu tried, but failed, to find another anaesthetist. Hughes\u2019s surgery eventually went ahead, but not until around three hours after the intended slot. During the operation Hughes bled a lot more than expected and, it turned out, was also suffering from cirrhosis of the liver. By the time the surgery was over and Hughes was transferred to intensive care, it was clear that he had an uphill battle ahead.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55d7941b681ee1a751d113bf762ddd4d4bf45e67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55d7941b681ee1a751d113bf762ddd4d4bf45e67/0_0_3156_1893/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On trial: consultant David Sellu makes his first appearance at Hendon Magistrates Court accompanied by his wife and son in August 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On trial: consultant David Sellu makes his first appearance at Hendon Magistrates Court accompanied by his wife and son in August 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: National Pictures/TopFoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sadly, it was one he couldn\u2019t win. Hughes died two days later, without ever regaining consciousness. Sellu remembers being told the news by a colleague on the phone. \u201cWhen something like that happens, you go through a very difficult time. You agonise about whether you could have done anything different \u2013 this happens after every death.\u201d More than a third of people who suffer from a perforated bowel die from it in the UK, however good their care. Nevertheless, it at no time occurred to Sellu that he might have caused his patient\u2019s death \u2013 or that anyone would imagine he had.</p> <p><em><strong>David Sellu\u2019s official</strong></em> birthdate is 22 November 1946, but that almost certainly wasn\u2019t the day he was born. He grew up in a village in a rural part of Sierra Leone, the eldest of 10 children. Neither of his parents could read or write and they expected their son\u2019s life would be like their lives, spent cultivating rice and tending to a small flock of sheep and goats. After he started to teach himself to read, his aunt got him a place in the local school \u2013 and on the first day, she and the headteacher chose his birthdate. It didn\u2019t make much difference to Sellu when anyone thought he was born, until 1968 when he needed to apply for a passport.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was numb. I\u2019d never imagined that we could ever be in that situation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He\u2019d done remarkably well academically and had won a scholarship to study medicine at Manchester University. He boarded a plane for the first time in his life and arrived in the UK knowing no one. When he realised he\u2019d left his toothbrush at home he headed into a shop near his hostel in London to buy another. The shop was Harrods: an attendant kindly pointed him towards another shop called Boots down the road.</p> <p>Fast forward four decades and Sellu had risen to become a senior consultant specialising in gastrointestinal and colorectal surgery. He and his wife Catherine, whom he had met when he was a registrar and she was a staff nurse at Hammersmith Hospital, lived with their family in a large, comfortable home in west London. There were four Sellu children and James, the youngest, decided to follow his father into medicine. Today, James is with his father to meet me, and he takes up the story. \u201cWe were living a good life,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had everything we wanted. I knew my father worked extremely hard \u2013 often he\u2019d already be at work when I woke up, and still at work when I went to bed. But I heard my parents discussing their patients and the difference they made to their lives and I found it inspiring. I wanted to do the same with my life.\u201d In the autumn of 2009, James got a place to study medicine at his father\u2019s old university.</p> <p>Meanwhile, across in Armagh, a builder with a painful leg was already thinking about having a knee replacement in London, a decision that would lead to his own death, but would also have a dramatic effect on the lives of both David Sellu and his son James.</p> <p><em><strong>The circumstances of</strong></em> Hughes\u2019s death meant an inquiry was inevitable and Sellu welcomed it. During the course of his career, he says, medicine has become increasingly complex. \u201cYou have doctors, nurses, managers, laboratories, protocols,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhen something goes wrong, you need to look at the whole system.\u201d</p> <p>Professor Duncan Empey, group medical director of the Churchill Hospital\u2019s parent group BMI, commissioned the report and, to Sellu\u2019s surprise, its two investigators were asked to trawl through his history to see whether he had made mistakes in the past. This, says Sellu, was unfair: put any surgeon\u2019s work under scrutiny and you will always find some instances where things went wrong; equally, any mismanagement should have been dealt with at the time. Either way, Sellu says he was never so much as criticised during his long career.</p> <p>The Empey report, as it was known, was critical of Sellu and he was summoned to appear before the General Medical Council (GMC) to defend himself against charges that his treatment of Hughes had fallen below the standard expected, to a serious degree; but neither the GMC nor, later on, the inquest or court, were aware of another report, the Root Cause Analysis (RCA), that was commissioned by the hospital to look into its procedures and carried out by its quality manager. Initially, the GMC decided there was no case to answer, but said it would await the outcome of further inquiries including the coroner\u2019s inquest. On a subsequent occasion, when he was summoned again to the GMC, Sellu noticed something troubling: all the other doctors up before the regulators on the day he was there were people, like him, who had foreign names.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ea6c1ee1d4114eea02228f28380aa5ec437e8c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ea6c1ee1d4114eea02228f28380aa5ec437e8c2/14_927_2796_1677/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Clearing his name: David Sellu at the Old Bailey in 2013. \u2018When I was in prison I realised this could destroy me.

The coroner homed in on the delay in performing surgery and then, all of a sudden, he interrupted proceedings, asked Sellu to step outside, and told Sellu\u2019s counsel and the court that he believed a crime had been committed. This led to a police investigation into whether or not Sellu had done enough to reduce the delays; and it culminated in the consultant being charged, in July 2012, on two counts: gross negligent manslaughter of James Hughes, and perjury in the coroner\u2019s court, which related to answers he had given when he first saw the CT scan report.</p> <p>For Sellu and his family, the cloud that had been hanging over their lives for the two years since the coroner referred the matter to the police was suddenly a full-blown storm. David and Catherine had done their best to keep how serious things were from their children, which meant that James, at university in Manchester, was shocked when he got the news. He remembers how it felt to be in court, and to see his father in the dock. \u201cI was numb,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d never imagined that we could ever be in that situation.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These days I\u2019m very wary. I\u2019ve realised you don\u2019t know who are your friends</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The case was tried in October and November 2013: Sellu was found not guilty of the perjury charge, but guilty by a majority of 10 to two \u2013 the minimum required to convict \u2013 of the manslaughter charge. He was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison, and served 15 months \u2013 including time in two prisons in Suffolk, many miles from his family, who had to make long journeys across the country to see him. James took breaks from his studies to support his mother and sisters on these trips.</p> <p>In his book, Sellu describes, movingly, his quiet but determined dignity in appalling conditions. Sharing a cell with two other men for up to 22 hours a day, he says, was like being locked in a toilet with strangers. Recreation, exercise and meaningful work were scarce. To while away the hours he taught himself Arabic and improved his French.</p> <p>Eventually there were opportunities for home leave and on one such occasion James delivered what David remembers as \u201ca bombshell\u201d. Despite having secured a merit in his master\u2019s degree and completing his medical degree, James had decided to stop his career as a doctor before it had even begun. His father\u2019s eyes fill with tears as he remembers hearing the news. \u201cCatherine and I had always encouraged him, always believed medicine was a wonderful career. We were devastated.\u201d</p> <p>Sellu was released in February 2015. In November 2016, after a campaign led by a fellow doctor, consultant neurologist Jenny Vaughan, his conviction was overturned by three appeal judges on the grounds the judge had not properly directed the jury. It emerged that in the RCA report the hospital\u2019s identified failings included its lack of an emergency anaesthetic rota. The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) ruled that it was satisfied Sellu had taken proactive steps to perform surgery and that Hughes\u2019s condition had not significantly deteriorated on the afternoon before the operation. Dr Rob Hendry, medical director at the Medical Protection Society, who represented Mr Sellu, said: \u201cThe tribunal heard all of the evidence in this case and tested it rigorously. As we have said before, they are best placed to weigh up all of the factors affecting a doctor\u2019s fitness to practise. By contrast, a criminal court is rarely the best place to hold a doctor to account for what has happened in a complex clinical environment.\u201d</p> <p>James has not revisited his decision to quit medicine. \u201cWhen something goes wrong, people look for a scapegoat,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re a black doctor, you\u2019re first in line. I loved the idea of being a doctor and impacting positively on other people\u2019s lives, but almost all doctors work in the private sector as well as the NHS, and the NHS needs the private sector to survive. And being a black doctor is just too risky. Also, if you end up in court, as my father did, you find yourself being tried by people who, with all due respect, haven\u2019t got a clue what they\u2019re listening to. At one point during my father\u2019s trial I noticed one of the jurors looking at a piece of evidence upside down.\u201d</p> <p>James Sellu now has a job in sales. His father \u2013 exonerated, cleared by the GMC \u2013 is back working part-time. He is \u201ca stronger person\u201d now, he reflects, \u201cand maybe a more compassionate one. But these days I\u2019m very wary. I\u2019ve realised you don\u2019t know who are your friends, and who are your enemies.\u201d He feels what happened to him contains important lessons both for the medical system and about racism, and he wants to highlight how individuals are being made to carry the can for the failures of a complex and under-resourced system.</p> <p>And yet, remarkably, there\u2019s no hint of anger about him. \u201cWhen I was in prison I realised this could destroy me,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew I couldn\u2019t allow it to do that. Many doctors who are investigated for alleged negligence take their own lives, and many people in prison take their own lives. I knew I had to look after my psychological health.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019ll always be sad about the choice James made, but he understands it. \u201cHaving been through what I\u2019d been through, I could see it from James\u2019s point of view. He saw how much I\u2019d sacrificed to be a doctor \u2013 and yet I ended up in a prison cell. So yes, I can see why he had second thoughts about following me down the same path.\u201d</p> <p><em>Did He Save Lives?

      "bodyText": "It was a winter evening at a hospital just outside London and colorectal surgeon David Sellu\u2019s clinic was busy. But when a fellow doctor, an orthopaedic surgeon, asked him if he would see one of his patients, Sellu didn\u2019t hesitate to say yes. Which is how, an hour or so later, he came to meet the man whose death would turn him into a criminal serving 15 months in a prison cell. His new patient was a 66-year-old who had recently had a knee replacement, but was now complaining of abdominal pain. In Did He Save Lives?, the book that documents his story, Sellu recalls shaking hands with the man, James Hughes, a retired builder from Northern Ireland, and sitting by his bed to talk about how he was feeling. Sellu, now in his early 70s, speaks quietly and precisely. It\u2019s easy to imagine him on that evening nine years ago, pulling up a chair and explaining to Hughes that he\u2019d need painkillers to get him through the night and an urgent CT scan in the morning. That scan showed Hughes had a perforated bowel and would need surgery straight away. Sellu tried to book an operating slot, but the earliest he could secure a theatre and anaesthetist at the hospital, the private Clementine Churchill in Harrow, was for later that evening. At the last minute, however, the anaesthetist was delayed with another case. Sellu tried, but failed, to find another anaesthetist. Hughes\u2019s surgery eventually went ahead, but not until around three hours after the intended slot. During the operation Hughes bled a lot more than expected and, it turned out, was also suffering from cirrhosis of the liver. By the time the surgery was over and Hughes was transferred to intensive care, it was clear that he had an uphill battle ahead. Sadly, it was one he couldn\u2019t win. Hughes died two days later, without ever regaining consciousness. Sellu remembers being told the news by a colleague on the phone. \u201cWhen something like that happens, you go through a very difficult time. You agonise about whether you could have done anything different \u2013 this happens after every death.\u201d More than a third of people who suffer from a perforated bowel die from it in the UK, however good their care. Nevertheless, it at no time occurred to Sellu that he might have caused his patient\u2019s death \u2013 or that anyone would imagine he had. David Sellu\u2019s official birthdate is 22 November 1946, but that almost certainly wasn\u2019t the day he was born. He grew up in a village in a rural part of Sierra Leone, the eldest of 10 children. Neither of his parents could read or write and they expected their son\u2019s life would be like their lives, spent cultivating rice and tending to a small flock of sheep and goats. After he started to teach himself to read, his aunt got him a place in the local school \u2013 and on the first day, she and the headteacher chose his birthdate. It didn\u2019t make much difference to Sellu when anyone thought he was born, until 1968 when he needed to apply for a passport. He\u2019d done remarkably well academically and had won a scholarship to study medicine at Manchester University. He boarded a plane for the first time in his life and arrived in the UK knowing no one. When he realised he\u2019d left his toothbrush at home he headed into a shop near his hostel in London to buy another. The shop was Harrods: an attendant kindly pointed him towards another shop called Boots down the road. Fast forward four decades and Sellu had risen to become a senior consultant specialising in gastrointestinal and colorectal surgery. He and his wife Catherine, whom he had met when he was a registrar and she was a staff nurse at Hammersmith Hospital, lived with their family in a large, comfortable home in west London. There were four Sellu children and James, the youngest, decided to follow his father into medicine. Today, James is with his father to meet me, and he takes up the story. \u201cWe were living a good life,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had everything we wanted. I knew my father worked extremely hard \u2013 often he\u2019d already be at work when I woke up, and still at work when I went to bed. But I heard my parents discussing their patients and the difference they made to their lives and I found it inspiring. I wanted to do the same with my life.\u201d In the autumn of 2009, James got a place to study medicine at his father\u2019s old university. Meanwhile, across in Armagh, a builder with a painful leg was already thinking about having a knee replacement in London, a decision that would lead to his own death, but would also have a dramatic effect on the lives of both David Sellu and his son James. The circumstances of Hughes\u2019s death meant an inquiry was inevitable and Sellu welcomed it. During the course of his career, he says, medicine has become increasingly complex. \u201cYou have doctors, nurses, managers, laboratories, protocols,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhen something goes wrong, you need to look at the whole system.\u201d Professor Duncan Empey, group medical director of the Churchill Hospital\u2019s parent group BMI, commissioned the report and, to Sellu\u2019s surprise, its two investigators were asked to trawl through his history to see whether he had made mistakes in the past. This, says Sellu, was unfair: put any surgeon\u2019s work under scrutiny and you will always find some instances where things went wrong; equally, any mismanagement should have been dealt with at the time. Either way, Sellu says he was never so much as criticised during his long career. The Empey report, as it was known, was critical of Sellu and he was summoned to appear before the General Medical Council (GMC) to defend himself against charges that his treatment of Hughes had fallen below the standard expected, to a serious degree; but neither the GMC nor, later on, the inquest or court, were aware of another report, the Root Cause Analysis (RCA), that was commissioned by the hospital to look into its procedures and carried out by its quality manager. Initially, the GMC decided there was no case to answer, but said it would await the outcome of further inquiries including the coroner\u2019s inquest. On a subsequent occasion, when he was summoned again to the GMC, Sellu noticed something troubling: all the other doctors up before the regulators on the day he was there were people, like him, who had foreign names. It was the inquest into Hughes death, in October 2010, that changed everything. The coroner homed in on the delay in performing surgery and then, all of a sudden, he interrupted proceedings, asked Sellu to step outside, and told Sellu\u2019s counsel and the court that he believed a crime had been committed. This led to a police investigation into whether or not Sellu had done enough to reduce the delays; and it culminated in the consultant being charged, in July 2012, on two counts: gross negligent manslaughter of James Hughes, and perjury in the coroner\u2019s court, which related to answers he had given when he first saw the CT scan report. For Sellu and his family, the cloud that had been hanging over their lives for the two years since the coroner referred the matter to the police was suddenly a full-blown storm. David and Catherine had done their best to keep how serious things were from their children, which meant that James, at university in Manchester, was shocked when he got the news. He remembers how it felt to be in court, and to see his father in the dock. \u201cI was numb,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d never imagined that we could ever be in that situation.\u201d The case was tried in October and November 2013: Sellu was found not guilty of the perjury charge, but guilty by a majority of 10 to two \u2013 the minimum required to convict \u2013 of the manslaughter charge. He was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison, and served 15 months \u2013 including time in two prisons in Suffolk, many miles from his family, who had to make long journeys across the country to see him. James took breaks from his studies to support his mother and sisters on these trips. In his book, Sellu describes, movingly, his quiet but determined dignity in appalling conditions. Sharing a cell with two other men for up to 22 hours a day, he says, was like being locked in a toilet with strangers. Recreation, exercise and meaningful work were scarce. To while away the hours he taught himself Arabic and improved his French. Eventually there were opportunities for home leave and on one such occasion James delivered what David remembers as \u201ca bombshell\u201d. Despite having secured a merit in his master\u2019s degree and completing his medical degree, James had decided to stop his career as a doctor before it had even begun. His father\u2019s eyes fill with tears as he remembers hearing the news. \u201cCatherine and I had always encouraged him, always believed medicine was a wonderful career. We were devastated.\u201d Sellu was released in February 2015. In November 2016, after a campaign led by a fellow doctor, consultant neurologist Jenny Vaughan, his conviction was overturned by three appeal judges on the grounds the judge had not properly directed the jury. It emerged that in the RCA report the hospital\u2019s identified failings included its lack of an emergency anaesthetic rota. The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) ruled that it was satisfied Sellu had taken proactive steps to perform surgery and that Hughes\u2019s condition had not significantly deteriorated on the afternoon before the operation. Dr Rob Hendry, medical director at the Medical Protection Society, who represented Mr Sellu, said: \u201cThe tribunal heard all of the evidence in this case and tested it rigorously. As we have said before, they are best placed to weigh up all of the factors affecting a doctor\u2019s fitness to practise. By contrast, a criminal court is rarely the best place to hold a doctor to account for what has happened in a complex clinical environment.\u201d James has not revisited his decision to quit medicine. \u201cWhen something goes wrong, people look for a scapegoat,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re a black doctor, you\u2019re first in line. I loved the idea of being a doctor and impacting positively on other people\u2019s lives, but almost all doctors work in the private sector as well as the NHS, and the NHS needs the private sector to survive. And being a black doctor is just too risky. Also, if you end up in court, as my father did, you find yourself being tried by people who, with all due respect, haven\u2019t got a clue what they\u2019re listening to. At one point during my father\u2019s trial I noticed one of the jurors looking at a piece of evidence upside down.\u201d James Sellu now has a job in sales. His father \u2013 exonerated, cleared by the GMC \u2013 is back working part-time. He is \u201ca stronger person\u201d now, he reflects, \u201cand maybe a more compassionate one. But these days I\u2019m very wary. I\u2019ve realised you don\u2019t know who are your friends, and who are your enemies.\u201d He feels what happened to him contains important lessons both for the medical system and about racism, and he wants to highlight how individuals are being made to carry the can for the failures of a complex and under-resourced system. And yet, remarkably, there\u2019s no hint of anger about him. \u201cWhen I was in prison I realised this could destroy me,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew I couldn\u2019t allow it to do that. Many doctors who are investigated for alleged negligence take their own lives, and many people in prison take their own lives. I knew I had to look after my psychological health.\u201d He\u2019ll always be sad about the choice James made, but he understands it. \u201cHaving been through what I\u2019d been through, I could see it from James\u2019s point of view. He saw how much I\u2019d sacrificed to be a doctor \u2013 and yet I ended up in a prison cell. So yes, I can see why he had second thoughts about following me down the same path.\u201d Did He Save Lives? A Surgeon\u2019s Story by David Sellu is published by Sweetcroft on 4 July at \u00a39.99",

It rings true but only scratches the surface of another, more cruel reality\u2013 that, in their desperation to save face, the Soviets were willing to sacrifice any number of men, women and children. Even as radiation spewed out of the plant from the burning reactor core, local people told John and me how they had seen Communist apparatchiks in the area spirit their families to safety in Moscow while the residents were being urged to carry on as if nothing had happened. In Pripyat, the satellite city built for Chernobyl workers, windows were left open, children played outside, and gardeners dug their allotments.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ed4824a8b627ad4614b737a298e619139d0eb64c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed4824a8b627ad4614b737a298e619139d0eb64c/0_2_4080_2449/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In a scene from the TV series, doctors treat casualties.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>In a scene from the TV series, doctors treat casualties. </em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sky Atlantic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The plume of deadly radioactive dust was just a harmless steam discharge, residents were told.

Thousands of visitors traipse around the ghost city of Pripyat, taking snaps of the crumbling housing blocks, parched swimming pool, schoolrooms, abandoned funfair and overgrown streets. The first time we visited, it seemed post-apocalyptic. We found homes still furnished, with personal belongings lying around. People had been told to take only what they needed for two or three days. It looked as if they had just vanished into thin air. Outside, the public-address system was still playing maudlin music and the funfair, with its bumper cars and brightly-coloured ferris wheel, was beginning to rust.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d2eab46932a30cb8391b76c60dc040ae10e1052\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d2eab46932a30cb8391b76c60dc040ae10e1052/39_18_5945_3567/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Visitors walk in the ghost city of Pripyat during a tour in the Chernobyl exclusion zone.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Visitors walk in the ghost city of Pripyat during a tour in the Chernobyl exclusion zone.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Genya Savilov/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As we drove through the 30km <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2011/apr/26/chernobyl-nuclear-disaster-in-pictures\" title=\"\">exclusion zone</a>, where, in 1990, 20,000 people still lived and worked, into the \u201cdead zone\u201d \u2013 a 10km circle around the plant \u2013 we stopped at checkpoints to be scanned for radioactive particles. Every time the scanner either failed to work and was given a good kicking \u2013 and still didn\u2019t work \u2013 or it would wail alarmingly and be swiftly unplugged. There were no explanations except for: \u201cIt\u2019s safe\u201d.</p> <p>If John or I put a toe off the designated path, the scientist accompanying us would drop the \u201cit\u2019s safe\u201d line and scream \u201cno, no, no \u2026 not there. There\u2019s <em>not</em> safe.\u201d Scientists estimate the contaminated area will not be safe for 24,000 years, give or take a thousand.</p> <p>At the entrance to Reactor 3, next to the concrete sarcophagus hastily thrown over Reactor 4, the scanners were equally silent as we pressed our hands into the vertical pads. (An executive from the UK company that supplied the machines later called me to claim the Soviets had turned up the dose levels to avoid triggering an alert.)</p> <p>At the Chernobyl Research Centre, a short distance from the power plant, scientists showed us pine saplings grown from seeds from the nearby \u201cred forest\u201d where the trees glowed after absorbing radiation and had to be dug up and buried. The saplings were all bizarre mutations, some with needles growing backwards. There was no sign of wildlife, not even birds. The researchers spoke of mice with six toes and deformed teeth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"245db1f9d3ea3ecf6cfc3de6543936b44290c2e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/245db1f9d3ea3ecf6cfc3de6543936b44290c2e1/0_224_2560_1535/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Downing photographing children from Chernobyl in a nearby hospital.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Downing photographing children from Chernobyl in a nearby hospital.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kim Willsher</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Soviets were not the only ones who lied.

Dissident scientist Andrei Sakharov was also deceived. \u201cTo my shame, I at first pretended that nothing much had happened,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Many doctors insisted there had been a spike in the number of cancers and leukemias. Children had been born with rare deformities including \u201cfrogs\u2019 legs\u201d, their hips twisted outwards. Others had heart defects, and thyroid cancers thought to have been caused by radioactive iodine. </p> <p>Yet officials insisted that all this was \u201cpoor food and poverty\u201d and unrelated to Chernobyl.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/gallery/2019/jun/15/the-photography-of-john-downing\">The photography of John Downing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In bare, prison-like hospitals, parents would thrust children at us and beg us to take them to the UK or plead for medicines or money for medicines.

Yet officials would say it was \u201canecdotal evidence\u201d and nothing to do with Chernobyl.

On 1 May 1986, the teenager and her school friends were ordered out on to the streets of the Ukrainian capital Kiev to take part in traditional parades. Oksana\u2019s father, a singer, was told it was his \u201cpatriotic duty\u201d to go with his male voice choir to Chernobyl to sing to the \u201cclean-up\u201d workers.

In the next room, Oksana lay dying, a skeletal figure staring blindly at the ceiling, who bore no resemblance to the smiling blond girl in a photograph on the mantlepiece.

      "bodyText": "There is a line in the television series Chernobyl that comes as no surprise to those of us who reported on the 1986 nuclear disaster in what was the Soviet Union \u2013 but that still has the power to shock: \u201cThe official position of the state is that global nuclear catastrophe is not possible in the Soviet Union.\u201d It was not possible, so in the days and months after the world\u2019s worst such accident, on 26 April, the Kremlin kept up its pretence. It dissembled, deceived and lied. I began investigating Chernobyl in the late 1980s after Ukrainian friends insisted authorities in the USSR were covering up the extent of the human tragedy of those \u2013 many of them children \u2013 contaminated by radiation when the nuclear plant\u2019s Reactor 4 exploded, blasting a cloud of poisonous fallout across the USSR and a large swathe of Europe. When photographer John Downing and I first visited, the Soviet Union, then on its last political legs, was still in denial about what happened despite president Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s new era of glasnost. The Chernobyl miniseries is a compelling account of how the disaster unfolded, based largely on the testimony of those present, most of whom died soon afterwards. It rings true but only scratches the surface of another, more cruel reality\u2013 that, in their desperation to save face, the Soviets were willing to sacrifice any number of men, women and children. Even as radiation spewed out of the plant from the burning reactor core, local people told John and me how they had seen Communist apparatchiks in the area spirit their families to safety in Moscow while the residents were being urged to carry on as if nothing had happened. In Pripyat, the satellite city built for Chernobyl workers, windows were left open, children played outside, and gardeners dug their allotments. The plume of deadly radioactive dust was just a harmless steam discharge, residents were told. It was 36 hours before the city was evacuated, by which time some were already showing signs of radiation sickness. On the TV news on 29 April \u2013 more than three days after the catastrophe, with the reactor fire still burning \u2013 Chernobyl was the sixth item. \u201cThere has been an accident\u201d the female presenter stated. \u201cTwo people have died\u201d. Schoolchildren in Byelorussia and Ukraine \u2013 the worst hit by fallout \u2013 were instructed to continue with their May Day celebrations and parades, even as the rain brought radioactive particles down on them. Today, Chernobyl is a tourist attraction. Thousands of visitors traipse around the ghost city of Pripyat, taking snaps of the crumbling housing blocks, parched swimming pool, schoolrooms, abandoned funfair and overgrown streets. The first time we visited, it seemed post-apocalyptic. We found homes still furnished, with personal belongings lying around. People had been told to take only what they needed for two or three days. It looked as if they had just vanished into thin air. Outside, the public-address system was still playing maudlin music and the funfair, with its bumper cars and brightly-coloured ferris wheel, was beginning to rust. As we drove through the 30km exclusion zone, where, in 1990, 20,000 people still lived and worked, into the \u201cdead zone\u201d \u2013 a 10km circle around the plant \u2013 we stopped at checkpoints to be scanned for radioactive particles. Every time the scanner either failed to work and was given a good kicking \u2013 and still didn\u2019t work \u2013 or it would wail alarmingly and be swiftly unplugged. There were no explanations except for: \u201cIt\u2019s safe\u201d. If John or I put a toe off the designated path, the scientist accompanying us would drop the \u201cit\u2019s safe\u201d line and scream \u201cno, no, no \u2026 not there. There\u2019s not safe.\u201d Scientists estimate the contaminated area will not be safe for 24,000 years, give or take a thousand. At the entrance to Reactor 3, next to the concrete sarcophagus hastily thrown over Reactor 4, the scanners were equally silent as we pressed our hands into the vertical pads. (An executive from the UK company that supplied the machines later called me to claim the Soviets had turned up the dose levels to avoid triggering an alert.) At the Chernobyl Research Centre, a short distance from the power plant, scientists showed us pine saplings grown from seeds from the nearby \u201cred forest\u201d where the trees glowed after absorbing radiation and had to be dug up and buried. The saplings were all bizarre mutations, some with needles growing backwards. There was no sign of wildlife, not even birds. The researchers spoke of mice with six toes and deformed teeth. The Soviets were not the only ones who lied. France\u2019s authorities hid information about the radioactive cloud over its territory, and Hans Blix, then director general of the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA)\u2013 still accused of minimising the dangers following the catastrophe\u2013 released a statement that settlements around Chernobyl would \u201cbe safe for residents\u201d before long. Dissident scientist Andrei Sakharov was also deceived. \u201cTo my shame, I at first pretended that nothing much had happened,\u201d he said. Many doctors insisted there had been a spike in the number of cancers and leukemias. Children had been born with rare deformities including \u201cfrogs\u2019 legs\u201d, their hips twisted outwards. Others had heart defects, and thyroid cancers thought to have been caused by radioactive iodine. Yet officials insisted that all this was \u201cpoor food and poverty\u201d and unrelated to Chernobyl. In bare, prison-like hospitals, parents would thrust children at us and beg us to take them to the UK or plead for medicines or money for medicines. Oncologists told us they were so short of chemotherapy drugs they would give one sick child half a protocol and another the other half, condemning both. Yet officials would say it was \u201canecdotal evidence\u201d and nothing to do with Chernobyl. We were welcomed by dozens of desperate families, good Soviet citizens who had little but would put what little they had on the table to show us hospitality, and who could not understand why their leaders could not explain why their children were dying of radiation-linked diseases except to say \u201cit\u2019s not Chernobyl\u201d. For me, one particular girl, Oksana, and her family, encapsulated the human tragedy. On 1 May 1986, the teenager and her school friends were ordered out on to the streets of the Ukrainian capital Kiev to take part in traditional parades. Oksana\u2019s father, a singer, was told it was his \u201cpatriotic duty\u201d to go with his male voice choir to Chernobyl to sing to the \u201cclean-up\u201d workers. He told us he had been more scared of the still raging reactor fire than the silent, invisible killer he was breathing in and out. Oksana\u2019s parents pressed cakes, local \u201cchampagne\u201d, brandy and vodka on us and talked about their only child\u2019s unexplained \u201csickness\u201d. In the next room, Oksana lay dying, a skeletal figure staring blindly at the ceiling, who bore no resemblance to the smiling blond girl in a photograph on the mantlepiece. She did not speak and did not appear to respond to anything or to move, except to blink slowly every few minutes. Oksana died, as did many others \u2013but because no data was kept from before the disaster, nothing can be proven. Today, as the TV series points out, the official number of directly attributable victims of Chernobyl is 31. Other, \u201cunscientific\u201d, estimates vary from 4,000 to 93,000. John and I returned several times to Chernobyl. When I went back for the 30th anniversary three years ago, and interviewed Pripyat residents evacuated to the town of Slavutych, all told of friends and relatives who had died prematurely after the disaster: more \u201canecdotal evidence\u201d of the ongoing Chernobyl tragedy. Now my photographer friend John Downing has terminal lung cancer. \u201cI often wonder if Chernobyl had anything to do with it,\u201d he told me. Like many others, he will never know. John reminded me of a scientist we met in Moscow. The man had spent some time in Chernobyl. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget. He took a notebook out of his desk and ran a Geiger counter over it, which started crackling like mad. Four years on, and it was still highly radioactive,\u201d John said. Today, 33 years on, Vladimir Putin has dismissed the TV miniseries as US misinformation and reportedly said Russia will make its own \u201cversion\u201d blaming the CIA. Like radiation, Kremlin propaganda has a long half-life. Poison legacy Chernobyl was to be the largest nuclear plant in the world, with 12 reactors. Years before the catastrophe, a KGB report highlighted flaws in the RBMK reactor. The radioactive elements released in the explosion are active for between 30 and 24,000 years \u2013 an environmental threat for centuries. Up to 600,000 people, known as \u2018liquidators\u2019, took part in the clean-up. Some were ordered to shovel fatally radioactive graphite, working in shifts of 90 seconds each. About 350,000 people from more than 200 villages were evacuated. The last reactor was shut down in 2000.",

      "body": "<p>When I walked past <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/may/07/mural-of-journalist-lyra-mckee-unveiled-in-belfast\" title=\"\">the mural honouring Lyra McKee in Belfast</a>, having just left the Holy Family Boxing Club a few minutes earlier, the tangled feelings took hold of me. The smiling face of McKee, the gifted 29-year-old journalist and novelist who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/apr/19/derry-woman-killed-in-terrorist-act-say-northern-ireland-police\" title=\"\">had been shot dead while she was reporting on rioting in Derry on 18 April 2019</a>, gave me a shock of sadness. But I smiled when I saw her words on the wall: \u201cIt won\u2019t always be like this. It\u2019s going to get better.\u201d</p> <p>Having spent another morning with Gerry Storey, the inspirational 83-year-old boxing trainer at the Holy Family, it seemed as if sunshine lit up that dark green wall again. Storey has lived his life instilling the hope that resonates through McKee\u2019s words. He has used the violent business of boxing to spread peace and reconciliation for 60 years. Amid the many examples of his courage I thought of one specific encounter as I gazed at this new mural.</p> <p>On a Sunday night near the end of winter in 1972, Belfast looked like a ghost town. Storey would not have been surprised to see tumbleweed blowing through the empty streets or a creaking barroom door swing open as a gunman loomed into view. There were more guns, bombs and cowboys dressed in sinister black balaclavas than in a Hollywood movie.</p> <p>The burned-out husks of buses and cars were a silent reminder of recent rioting and bombings. These were bleak times but Storey, whose gym was found in the Republican area of New Lodge, offered hope and progress. He loved working with young fighters, watching them bloom between the ropes, and the Holy Family rules were sacrosanct. Once you stepped inside the gym you left the world outside. Before you reached the heavy bags dangling from steel hooks, and the speed balls waiting to be pummelled with rhythmic precision, you shed the Troubles. You trained to become a better boxer and a better person.</p> <p>When gyms from across the sectarian divide asked for help, Storey showed the same generosity. He travelled into Loyalist territory to pick up fighters or spend time in rival gyms. Most boxing clubs around Belfast had shut down. It was dangerous to operate at night and the few surviving gyms looked to the Holy Family as a template for the future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df3ee1ade66233de50728f88d407c03122fb52ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df3ee1ade66233de50728f88d407c03122fb52ae/158_157_1411_846/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The boxer and photographer Hugh Russell\u2019s picture of a Belfast bombing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The boxer and photographer Hugh Russell\u2019s picture of a Belfast bombing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hugh Russell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No one crisscrossed Belfast like Storey. He was always unarmed as he knew boxing obliterated division and strife. There could be no forbidden areas to a boxing man who moved easily from an IRA heartland to a UVF or UDA enclave.</p> <p>Storey was safe in New Lodge as the IRA links of his brother Bobby Sr, and his nephews Seamus and Bobby Jr, were respected. But the genial trainer had been summoned to meet the Loyalist Army Council just off the Shankill Road. He felt calm. If the paramilitaries warned him, he would simply explain his motives. Storey did not consider more ominous possibilities.</p> <p>He parked his car on a side street. One of three minders led Storey up a narrow stairwell to the first floor. The minder knocked on the door and waited. This moment would have turned the blood of most men cold. Yet, with one deep breath to steady himself, Storey walked into the room. A dozen men watched him approach.</p> <p>\u201cGood evening,\u201d he said, breaking the silence.</p> <p>\u201cGerry Storey,\u201d one of the men said, rising to his feet and extending his hand.</p> <p>Storey recognised Harry Burgess, Bob Morrison and Tucker Lyttle. He avoided looking too closely at anyone else. Too much knowledge in Belfast could be a dangerous thing.</p> <p>\u201cTake a seat, Gerry,\u201d Burgess said, pointing to an empty chair.</p> <p>The formality of the setting, and the seriousness of the men, meant Storey had not been wrong. These boys were the top Loyalist paramilitaries in the North. \u201cWe know what you\u2019ve been doing,\u201d another man said quietly. \u201cYou\u2019ve never hid it.\u201d</p> <p>There was a long silence and then a different Loyalist leader leaned across the table. He was close enough that Storey could have ruffled the man\u2019s hair.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u201cIf anybody offends you, they will be dealt with severely,\u201d another man said, that last word laced with menace</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe understand what you\u2019re trying to do,\u201d the man said. \u201cWe\u2019re behind you 100%.\u201d</p> <p>It was incredible \u2013 for many of the men were used to ordering the murder of a random Catholic or planning retaliatory attacks on Republican communities. Yet they were embracing a Catholic boxing trainer whose family was linked to the IRA.</p> <p>\u201cGerry,\u201d Burgess continued, \u201cwe\u2019d love you to run more of your shows on Rumford Street. Bring the kids from the Holy Family and box in our club.\u201d</p> <p>The Rumford Social Club, just off the Shankill Road, was an infamous meeting place for Loyalist paramilitaries. \u201cYou\u2019ll have our protection,\u201d a heavy-set man said, spreading his arms to indicate the full might of the UDA, the UVF and UFF. If Storey, the leading amateur trainer in Britain and Ireland, had not believed in the power of boxing, he would have thought it miraculous.</p> <p>\u201cIf anybody offends you, they will be dealt with severely,\u201d another man said, his gruff voice lacing that last word with menace. They would maim or kill anyone who offended him.</p> <p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d Storey said. \u201cMy boys will be delighted to box at the Rumford.\u201d</p> <p>The men rose to shake his hand. It was so harmonious that Storey wondered why it could not always be this simple. Why could only boxing bring them together?</p> <p>There were still three assassination attempts on his life over the years. The bitterness of those who opposed his peaceful work was stemmed only by orders from paramilitary leaders on both sides that Storey should be spared.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and thebiggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>There were often riots and shootouts around the Holy Family but a surreal ceasefire ensued whenever Storey\u2019s green Cortina cruised into view. The \u201cgunplay\u201d would abate until the trainer was safely inside the gym where he would work with Catholic and Protestant fighters.</p> <p>Two of Storey\u2019s best \u201cwee boxers\u201d, Hugh Russell and Davy Larmour, came from different backgrounds. Russell from New Lodge; Larmour from the Shankill. Years later, as professional fighters, they supplemented their boxing income with other work. Russell was on his way to becoming one of the great photographers of the Troubles and he had begun working at the <em>Irish News</em>. Larmour worked at the docks and drove a pirate taxi at night.</p> <p>They fought two savage battles. Yet there was no trouble outside the ring and Russell and Larmour, a Catholic and a Protestant, remained friends. That friendship was illuminated in the aftermath of their first brutal bout at the Ulster Hall in March 1982.</p> <p>A victorious but bloodied Russell moved towards his mother. Eileen Russell clutched her glasses in her left hand. She had hardly worn them all night as she could not bear to watch. Russell was still in the ring but his arms were outstretched, as if to tell his mum he needed her.</p> <p>Brendan Murphy, the renowned photographer who was Russell\u2019s mentor, framed his shot perfectly. He caught his battered protege leaning through the ropes to kiss his mother. Love and relief, mingled with tears and horror, were etched into Eileen\u2019s face. Murphy pressed the shutter just before they kissed. His black-and-white photograph distilled boxing\u2019s gory drama and bruising intimacy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93e2dd259c54b44f963e8890544767d0e8820806\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93e2dd259c54b44f963e8890544767d0e8820806/620_621_5961_4613/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hugh Russell bends down to kiss his mother, Eileen, just after he beat Davy Larmour\" width=\"1000\" height=\"774\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hugh Russell bends down to kiss his mother, Eileen, just after he beat Davy Larmour.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Murphy/Irish News</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eileen Russell cried as she kissed her son. She wanted him to throw away the boxing gloves and pick up his camera for good. But she knew the urge to fight still pumped in his blood, which dripped on to the turquoise canvas.</p> <p>\u201cI won,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cYes, son,\u201d Eileen smiled up at him through her veil of tears. \u201cYou won.\u201d</p> <p>The loser hurt all over. In the shower Larmour watched the blood run from his face, chest and legs before it disappeared down the plughole with water which turned red beneath his feet. He lifted his tender face to the shower and winced. He had come so close to winning; but he would have to keep driving his taxi while he waited for the rematch.</p> <p>Larmour felt better as he towelled himself dry. The dressing room was silent as he pulled on his shoes and socks. His hands were bruised. He had hit Russell very hard, and very often. He was just about to pull on his jacket when an official came into the dressing room.</p> <p>\u201cDavy, how are you getting up to the hospital?\u201d the man asked.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m driving.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWould you take Hugh?\u201d the official asked.</p> <p>\u201cAye, no problem,\u201d Larmour said.</p> <p>\u201cGood man,\u201d the official murmured.</p> <p>The streets around the Ulster Hall had emptied and few would have seen two fierce rivals leave the scene of their epic fight together. When they got to Larmour\u2019s car, Russell stretched out in the back. It felt strange for Larmour to be driving again, as if he was back in his taxi, and he looked into the rearview mirror. He saw the fighting photographer\u2019s face, cut and swollen beneath the gauzy street lights.</p> <p>\u201cHow you doing, mate?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m OK, Davy,\u201d Russell said.</p> <p>Larmour and Russell joked about being stopped at an army checkpoint. They imagined the confusion if British soldiers saw a beaten-up Protestant driving a bloodied Catholic to hospital.</p> <p>A nurse led them each to a bed in the same room. She pulled a screen between them to offer some privacy. Davy closed his eyes as he ached with fatigue.</p> <p>Eventually, a doctor walked in and took a long look at Larmour\u2019s face. \u201cOh my,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been badly hurt. Who did this to you?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cfd740f4b2893a0437a92572b0688ea56ba133f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfd740f4b2893a0437a92572b0688ea56ba133f8/138_70_4826_2895/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hugh Russell and Davy Larmour in 2019, outside the Holy Family Boxing Gym.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hugh Russell (left) and Davy Larmour in 2019, outside the Holy Family Boxing Gym.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Davy pushed the screen away. \u201cHe did,\u201d he said with a laugh as he pointed at Russell, spread out on the adjoining bed.</p> <p>The doctor\u2019s eyes widened as he stared at Russell\u2019s freckly face which needed 33 stitches, twice as many as Larmour. The two boxers had been through the bloodiest fight of their lives.</p> <p>Storey, who inspired them both, remained at the Holy Family rather than work as a professional trainer. He knew he could give hope to many more lives if he steered young fighters away from the paramilitaries. It did not prevent the Provisional IRA or the Loyalist UDA and UVF from respecting his work which ran counter to their aims.</p> <p>That respect had been most obvious in the weeks following the 1981 hunger strikes when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2014/may/06/bobby-sands-hunger-strikers-ira\" title=\"\">Bobby Sands</a> and nine other Republican prisoners starved themselves to death. They had been locked in a desperate struggle with Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government as they protested against conditions in the Maze prison.</p> <p>With morale in the Maze at a new low, both Republican and Loyalist leaders in the cages asked for Storey to give them boxing tuition. For the next six months Storey went into the Maze twice a week. He would spend one afternoon in the Republican cages and another in the Loyalist cages. The prisoners were so uplifted that the opposing paramilitary groups in the Maze began talking to each other and even shared boxing equipment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f61378a53df99c1682fccd9e05b3fbebb658fa7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f61378a53df99c1682fccd9e05b3fbebb658fa7a/0_22_5184_3111/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gerry Storey hands over the Belle Storey perpetual trophies to the best male and female boxers in the Holy Family Boxing Club to Paddy Barnes and Michaela Walsh\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gerry Storey hands over the Belle Storey perpetual trophies to the best male and female boxers in the Holy Family Boxing Club to Paddy Barnes and Michaela Walsh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hugh Russell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was the kind of hope I know Lyra McKee would have loved. The McKee mural is found on the edge of the Cathedral Quarter, where the bars and caf\u00e9s are full of bearded hipsters and stylish young women showing off their tattoos and piercings, looking as if they would be as at home in Berlin or Copenhagen as Belfast. Despite McKee\u2019s death, Belfast felt like a city of warmth and hope.</p> <p>The Holy Family, still surrounded by old IRA murals, is a five-minute walk away. I took even more comfort from the fact that, just a few hours later, the club would be crammed again with 30 boys and girls returning to the oasis of boxing to work with Gerry Storey \u2013 an irreducibly hopeful man who, even in the darkest of times, has always made Belfast a better place.</p> <p><em>Donald McRae\u2019s </em><a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.co.uk/books/In-Sunshine-or-in-Shadow/Donald-McRae/9781471163104\" title=\"\"><em>In Sunshine or in Shadow</em></a><em>: How Boxing Brought Hope in the Troubles is published by Simon &amp; Schuster at \u00a320</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "When I walked past the mural honouring Lyra McKee in Belfast, having just left the Holy Family Boxing Club a few minutes earlier, the tangled feelings took hold of me. The smiling face of McKee, the gifted 29-year-old journalist and novelist who had been shot dead while she was reporting on rioting in Derry on 18 April 2019, gave me a shock of sadness. But I smiled when I saw her words on the wall: \u201cIt won\u2019t always be like this. It\u2019s going to get better.\u201d Having spent another morning with Gerry Storey, the inspirational 83-year-old boxing trainer at the Holy Family, it seemed as if sunshine lit up that dark green wall again. Storey has lived his life instilling the hope that resonates through McKee\u2019s words. He has used the violent business of boxing to spread peace and reconciliation for 60 years. Amid the many examples of his courage I thought of one specific encounter as I gazed at this new mural. On a Sunday night near the end of winter in 1972, Belfast looked like a ghost town. Storey would not have been surprised to see tumbleweed blowing through the empty streets or a creaking barroom door swing open as a gunman loomed into view. There were more guns, bombs and cowboys dressed in sinister black balaclavas than in a Hollywood movie. The burned-out husks of buses and cars were a silent reminder of recent rioting and bombings. These were bleak times but Storey, whose gym was found in the Republican area of New Lodge, offered hope and progress. He loved working with young fighters, watching them bloom between the ropes, and the Holy Family rules were sacrosanct. Once you stepped inside the gym you left the world outside. Before you reached the heavy bags dangling from steel hooks, and the speed balls waiting to be pummelled with rhythmic precision, you shed the Troubles. You trained to become a better boxer and a better person. When gyms from across the sectarian divide asked for help, Storey showed the same generosity. He travelled into Loyalist territory to pick up fighters or spend time in rival gyms. Most boxing clubs around Belfast had shut down. It was dangerous to operate at night and the few surviving gyms looked to the Holy Family as a template for the future. No one crisscrossed Belfast like Storey. He was always unarmed as he knew boxing obliterated division and strife. There could be no forbidden areas to a boxing man who moved easily from an IRA heartland to a UVF or UDA enclave. Storey was safe in New Lodge as the IRA links of his brother Bobby Sr, and his nephews Seamus and Bobby Jr, were respected. But the genial trainer had been summoned to meet the Loyalist Army Council just off the Shankill Road. He felt calm. If the paramilitaries warned him, he would simply explain his motives. Storey did not consider more ominous possibilities. He parked his car on a side street. One of three minders led Storey up a narrow stairwell to the first floor. The minder knocked on the door and waited. This moment would have turned the blood of most men cold. Yet, with one deep breath to steady himself, Storey walked into the room. A dozen men watched him approach. \u201cGood evening,\u201d he said, breaking the silence. \u201cGerry Storey,\u201d one of the men said, rising to his feet and extending his hand. Storey recognised Harry Burgess, Bob Morrison and Tucker Lyttle. He avoided looking too closely at anyone else. Too much knowledge in Belfast could be a dangerous thing. \u201cTake a seat, Gerry,\u201d Burgess said, pointing to an empty chair. The formality of the setting, and the seriousness of the men, meant Storey had not been wrong. These boys were the top Loyalist paramilitaries in the North. \u201cWe know what you\u2019ve been doing,\u201d another man said quietly. \u201cYou\u2019ve never hid it.\u201d There was a long silence and then a different Loyalist leader leaned across the table. He was close enough that Storey could have ruffled the man\u2019s hair. \u201cWe understand what you\u2019re trying to do,\u201d the man said. \u201cWe\u2019re behind you 100%.\u201d It was incredible \u2013 for many of the men were used to ordering the murder of a random Catholic or planning retaliatory attacks on Republican communities. Yet they were embracing a Catholic boxing trainer whose family was linked to the IRA. \u201cGerry,\u201d Burgess continued, \u201cwe\u2019d love you to run more of your shows on Rumford Street. Bring the kids from the Holy Family and box in our club.\u201d The Rumford Social Club, just off the Shankill Road, was an infamous meeting place for Loyalist paramilitaries. \u201cYou\u2019ll have our protection,\u201d a heavy-set man said, spreading his arms to indicate the full might of the UDA, the UVF and UFF. If Storey, the leading amateur trainer in Britain and Ireland, had not believed in the power of boxing, he would have thought it miraculous. \u201cIf anybody offends you, they will be dealt with severely,\u201d another man said, his gruff voice lacing that last word with menace. They would maim or kill anyone who offended him. \u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d Storey said. \u201cMy boys will be delighted to box at the Rumford.\u201d The men rose to shake his hand. It was so harmonious that Storey wondered why it could not always be this simple. Why could only boxing bring them together? There were still three assassination attempts on his life over the years. The bitterness of those who opposed his peaceful work was stemmed only by orders from paramilitary leaders on both sides that Storey should be spared. There were often riots and shootouts around the Holy Family but a surreal ceasefire ensued whenever Storey\u2019s green Cortina cruised into view. The \u201cgunplay\u201d would abate until the trainer was safely inside the gym where he would work with Catholic and Protestant fighters. Two of Storey\u2019s best \u201cwee boxers\u201d, Hugh Russell and Davy Larmour, came from different backgrounds. Russell from New Lodge; Larmour from the Shankill. Years later, as professional fighters, they supplemented their boxing income with other work. Russell was on his way to becoming one of the great photographers of the Troubles and he had begun working at the Irish News. Larmour worked at the docks and drove a pirate taxi at night. They fought two savage battles. Yet there was no trouble outside the ring and Russell and Larmour, a Catholic and a Protestant, remained friends. That friendship was illuminated in the aftermath of their first brutal bout at the Ulster Hall in March 1982. A victorious but bloodied Russell moved towards his mother. Eileen Russell clutched her glasses in her left hand. She had hardly worn them all night as she could not bear to watch. Russell was still in the ring but his arms were outstretched, as if to tell his mum he needed her. Brendan Murphy, the renowned photographer who was Russell\u2019s mentor, framed his shot perfectly. He caught his battered protege leaning through the ropes to kiss his mother. Love and relief, mingled with tears and horror, were etched into Eileen\u2019s face. Murphy pressed the shutter just before they kissed. His black-and-white photograph distilled boxing\u2019s gory drama and bruising intimacy. Eileen Russell cried as she kissed her son. She wanted him to throw away the boxing gloves and pick up his camera for good. But she knew the urge to fight still pumped in his blood, which dripped on to the turquoise canvas. \u201cI won,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, son,\u201d Eileen smiled up at him through her veil of tears. \u201cYou won.\u201d The loser hurt all over. In the shower Larmour watched the blood run from his face, chest and legs before it disappeared down the plughole with water which turned red beneath his feet. He lifted his tender face to the shower and winced. He had come so close to winning; but he would have to keep driving his taxi while he waited for the rematch. Larmour felt better as he towelled himself dry. The dressing room was silent as he pulled on his shoes and socks. His hands were bruised. He had hit Russell very hard, and very often. He was just about to pull on his jacket when an official came into the dressing room. \u201cDavy, how are you getting up to the hospital?\u201d the man asked. \u201cI\u2019m driving.\u201d \u201cWould you take Hugh?\u201d the official asked. \u201cAye, no problem,\u201d Larmour said. \u201cGood man,\u201d the official murmured. The streets around the Ulster Hall had emptied and few would have seen two fierce rivals leave the scene of their epic fight together. When they got to Larmour\u2019s car, Russell stretched out in the back. It felt strange for Larmour to be driving again, as if he was back in his taxi, and he looked into the rearview mirror. He saw the fighting photographer\u2019s face, cut and swollen beneath the gauzy street lights. \u201cHow you doing, mate?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019m OK, Davy,\u201d Russell said. Larmour and Russell joked about being stopped at an army checkpoint. They imagined the confusion if British soldiers saw a beaten-up Protestant driving a bloodied Catholic to hospital. A nurse led them each to a bed in the same room. She pulled a screen between them to offer some privacy. Davy closed his eyes as he ached with fatigue. Eventually, a doctor walked in and took a long look at Larmour\u2019s face. \u201cOh my,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been badly hurt. Who did this to you?\u201d Davy pushed the screen away. \u201cHe did,\u201d he said with a laugh as he pointed at Russell, spread out on the adjoining bed. The doctor\u2019s eyes widened as he stared at Russell\u2019s freckly face which needed 33 stitches, twice as many as Larmour. The two boxers had been through the bloodiest fight of their lives. Storey, who inspired them both, remained at the Holy Family rather than work as a professional trainer. He knew he could give hope to many more lives if he steered young fighters away from the paramilitaries. It did not prevent the Provisional IRA or the Loyalist UDA and UVF from respecting his work which ran counter to their aims. That respect had been most obvious in the weeks following the 1981 hunger strikes when Bobby Sands and nine other Republican prisoners starved themselves to death. They had been locked in a desperate struggle with Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government as they protested against conditions in the Maze prison. With morale in the Maze at a new low, both Republican and Loyalist leaders in the cages asked for Storey to give them boxing tuition. For the next six months Storey went into the Maze twice a week. He would spend one afternoon in the Republican cages and another in the Loyalist cages. The prisoners were so uplifted that the opposing paramilitary groups in the Maze began talking to each other and even shared boxing equipment. It was the kind of hope I know Lyra McKee would have loved. The McKee mural is found on the edge of the Cathedral Quarter, where the bars and caf\u00e9s are full of bearded hipsters and stylish young women showing off their tattoos and piercings, looking as if they would be as at home in Berlin or Copenhagen as Belfast. Despite McKee\u2019s death, Belfast felt like a city of warmth and hope. The Holy Family, still surrounded by old IRA murals, is a five-minute walk away. I took even more comfort from the fact that, just a few hours later, the club would be crammed again with 30 boys and girls returning to the oasis of boxing to work with Gerry Storey \u2013 an irreducibly hopeful man who, even in the darkest of times, has always made Belfast a better place.

      "body": "<p>Our Guardian Tokyo Week has touched on everything from unauthorised picnics to underground rap battles between businessmen. We explored in depth whether next year\u2019s Olympics can live up to the 1964 games, how Tokyo is bracing itself for its next once-in-a century earthquake, and how life is changing for women in the city.</p> <p>We asked you for your thoughts on how the city\u2019s changed, and for your comments on our coverage.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what you told us:</p> <h2>\u2018What is so great about Tokyo \u201cfinally opening up\u201d?\u2019</h2> <p>In response to our report by the Guardian\u2019s Tokyo correspondent, Justin McCurry, on whether the city is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/10/tokyo-big-year-is-the-impenetrable-city-finally-opening-up\">opening up to the outside world</a>, Lou, who has lived in Tokyo for 20 years, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Tokyo is changing, but not for the better. Many old, beautiful traditions are dying out. Young people aren\u2019t upholding them. English is infiltrating and the result is not good \u2013 the Japanese language is chock full of random, annoying English words.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mass immigration will be the nail in the coffin. Japan will be \u2018globalised\u2019 and its traditions relegated to tourist spots. Why do we want Tokyo to be like London? What is so great about Tokyo \u2018finally opening up\u2019? The whole world is becoming a homogenous lump. Where will the tourists go then?\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>On social media we asked readers to share their hopes and fears for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. @kakiandbambino said he hoped no-one - players, staff or spectators \u2013 dies due to heatstroke.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/kakiandbambino/status/1136797889890357248\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"ja\" dir=\"ltr\">\u9078\u624b\u3001\u30b9\u30bf\u30c3\u30d5\u3001\u89b3\u5ba2\u306e\u65b9\u3005\u304c\u3001\u71b1\u4e2d\u75c7\u3067\u4ea1\u304f\u306a\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3088\u3046\u306b\u3002</p>&mdash; kakiko ide (@kakiandbambino) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kakiandbambino/status/1136797889890357248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 7, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2>\u2018An environmental disaster\u2019</h2> <p>The Guardian\u2019s athetics correspondent, Sean Ingle, reported from the city on whether Tokyo 2020 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/11/robots-and-reconstruction-can-tokyo-2020-top-1964s-olympic-legacy\">can live up to 1964\u2019s Olympic legacy</a>: \u201cSuch was the event\u2019s success that it has set the bar dazzlingly high for Tokyo 2020.\u201d</p> <p>Toby Miller got in touch to highlight the darker side of those games. He said the 1964 Tokyo Olympics was \u201can environmental and human, classic Cold-War disaster\u201d. Miller, author of Greenwashing Sport, describes environment destruction caused by the construction of the high-speed rail link between Osaka and Tokyo.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The canals, sea, and rivers below the railway were inundated with concrete and landfill, and a centuries-old field of seaweed destroyed. Water stagnated, sludge emerged, and sea life perished. Estuaries turned into cesspools and/or were transformed into roads. The tramway system was virtually destroyed in favor of freeways and cars became dominant. Clearance of living things saw hundreds of thousands of homeless cats and dogs killed by the state. As with all very rapid, massive modernizations, from the US through the Soviet Union to China, this transformation was achieved through violence; in this case, the horror of war and its detritus, followed by preferential Cold-War terms.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <h2>\u2018Tokyo\u2019s Floating Stadium\u2019</h2> <p>Mid-week a curious email landed in our inbox. The subject line was \u201cTokyo\u2019s Floating Stadium\u201d, and it was sent from Florian Busch Architects, in Shibuya-ku. <a href=\"https://www.florianbusch.com/fsp\">It announced</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After several plans to build a new National Stadium for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo had been cancelled, the embarrassment was redeemed by an almost happy ending. In July of 2020, the New National Stadium, a ship, anchored under Odaiba\u2019s Rainbow Bridge and Tokyo became the first host of an era of a newfound Olympic spirit.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>This \u201cfloating stadium\u201d was a groundbreaking architectural feat that would travel the world, from one Olympic city to the next.</p> <p>It also wasn\u2019t real, but in fact an elaborate tease devised by the architect firm \u201cin response to the mess surrounding the Olympic stadium\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/12/tokyo-braces-earthquake-of-a-century-japanese-translation\">\u3053\u308c\u306f\u201d\u3082\u3057\u3082\u201d\u306e\u8a71\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\uff0d100\u5e74\u306b\u4e00\u5ea6\u306e\u9707\u707d\u306b\u5099\u3048\u308b\u6771\u4eac</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>\u2018Japanese academia is more open to non-Japanese professors\u2019</h2> <p>We <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/06/tokyoites-tell-us-how-your-city-is-changing\">asked readers to share their thoughts </a>about how Tokyo was changing. Laurence Williams, associate professor in the Faculty of Foreign Studies at Sophia University, a private university in Chiyoda ward in central Tokyo, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Japanese academia is much more open to non-Japanese professors than it used to be. Tokyo itself is diverse and exciting and this is a great time to be working in the city. Numbers of international students are rising sharply (because of demographic decline, universities are increasingly looking abroad). Most international students are still from elsewhere in Asia, although US/UK/Europe numbers are rising.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <h2>Old Japan and new Japan</h2> <p>Susannah, who lives in Shibuya, sent in this photo of the Imperial Palace from across the water, and writes: \u201cThis is just after New Years, and shows an impressive contrast between nature, old Japan, and new Japan.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0094989c26f1c80b5bd11555dd686ac6ce911dd8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0094989c26f1c80b5bd11555dd686ac6ce911dd8/0_171_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Old and new Japan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Old and new Japan</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Susie Krieble</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018Is this racism? Yes, but not, I think, in a straightforward way\u2019</h2> <p>David Chart wrote in to say that he served on Kawasaki City committees dealing with issues affecting foreign residents, and reckons the treatment of them hasn\u2019t changed. A couple of years ago he helped organise a survey of foreign residents living in Kawasaki to find out problems they were facing. In a <a href=\"https://www.davidchart.com/2016/11/02/experiences-of-racism-in-japan/\">blogpost</a> at the time about the survey results, he said the Japanese police occasionally single out foreigners due to their race, and ask them questions, and \u201csometimes they make them call their mothers\u201d. He told Guardian Cities: \u201cThe composition of the foreign population has changed a lot even while I have been here, but the problems they face have changed much less. Is this racism? Yes, but not, I think, in a straightforward way.</p> <h2>\u2018Central housing estates are experiencing a renaissance\u2019</h2> <p>On Tuesday we published an investigation by Guardian Cities and the Waseda Chronicle into how Tokyo\u2019s suburban housing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/11/how-tokyo-suburban-housing-blocks-became-ghettoes-for-the-old\">became vast ghettoes for elderly people</a>. Reader Lewis Parley wrote in to say:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Your article about the aging population of Tokyo\u2019s suburban housing estates was very informative. I think it would be beneficial to the series if you contrast this phenomenon with the renaissance some more central public housing estates are experiencing due to the influx of immigrant families ( Chinese in Kawaguchi, Indian/ Bangladeshi in Ojima, Koto-ku and Kasai, Edogawa-ku). By also featuring these places, I think you\u2019d give the reader a more balanced picture of the changes Tokyo\u2019s population is experiencing.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>During the week, people shared photos of their favourite and suprising Tokyo scenes on Twitter and Instagram, such as these posts:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/yoookd/status/1138427355096080384\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"ja\" dir=\"ltr\">My Tokyo memory:  the handrails of escalators at the underground stations in Tokyo are \u2018Antibacterial\u2019.  \u6771\u4eac\u306e\u5730\u4e0b\u9244\u30a8\u30b9\u30ab\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u306e\u624b\u3059\u308a\u3001\u6297\u83cc\u4ed5\u69d8\u3002<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GuardianTokyo?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GuardianTokyo</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardiancities?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@guardiancities</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/BsXyT9pjL5\">pic.twitter.com/BsXyT9pjL5</a></p>&mdash; Yo Okada-Howells (@yoookd) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yoookd/status/1138427355096080384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 11, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/yoookd/status/1138431656849788932\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Do you know lots of manhole covers in Tokyo show Sakura(cherry blossom)?

Here\u2019s what you told us: \u2018What is so great about Tokyo \u201cfinally opening up\u201d?\u2019 In response to our report by the Guardian\u2019s Tokyo correspondent, Justin McCurry, on whether the city is opening up to the outside world, Lou, who has lived in Tokyo for 20 years, said: Tokyo is changing, but not for the better. Many old, beautiful traditions are dying out. Young people aren\u2019t upholding them. English is infiltrating and the result is not good \u2013 the Japanese language is chock full of random, annoying English words. Mass immigration will be the nail in the coffin. Japan will be \u2018globalised\u2019 and its traditions relegated to tourist spots. Why do we want Tokyo to be like London? What is so great about Tokyo \u2018finally opening up\u2019? The whole world is becoming a homogenous lump. Where will the tourists go then?\u201d On social media we asked readers to share their hopes and fears for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. @kakiandbambino said he hoped no-one - players, staff or spectators \u2013 dies due to heatstroke. \u2018An environmental disaster\u2019 The Guardian\u2019s athetics correspondent, Sean Ingle, reported from the city on whether Tokyo 2020 can live up to 1964\u2019s Olympic legacy: \u201cSuch was the event\u2019s success that it has set the bar dazzlingly high for Tokyo 2020.\u201d Toby Miller got in touch to highlight the darker side of those games. He said the 1964 Tokyo Olympics was \u201can environmental and human, classic Cold-War disaster\u201d. Miller, author of Greenwashing Sport, describes environment destruction caused by the construction of the high-speed rail link between Osaka and Tokyo. The canals, sea, and rivers below the railway were inundated with concrete and landfill, and a centuries-old field of seaweed destroyed. Water stagnated, sludge emerged, and sea life perished. Estuaries turned into cesspools and/or were transformed into roads. The tramway system was virtually destroyed in favor of freeways and cars became dominant. Clearance of living things saw hundreds of thousands of homeless cats and dogs killed by the state. As with all very rapid, massive modernizations, from the US through the Soviet Union to China, this transformation was achieved through violence; in this case, the horror of war and its detritus, followed by preferential Cold-War terms.\u201d \u2018Tokyo\u2019s Floating Stadium\u2019 Mid-week a curious email landed in our inbox. The subject line was \u201cTokyo\u2019s Floating Stadium\u201d, and it was sent from Florian Busch Architects, in Shibuya-ku. It announced: After several plans to build a new National Stadium for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo had been cancelled, the embarrassment was redeemed by an almost happy ending. In July of 2020, the New National Stadium, a ship, anchored under Odaiba\u2019s Rainbow Bridge and Tokyo became the first host of an era of a newfound Olympic spirit.\u201d This \u201cfloating stadium\u201d was a groundbreaking architectural feat that would travel the world, from one Olympic city to the next. It also wasn\u2019t real, but in fact an elaborate tease devised by the architect firm \u201cin response to the mess surrounding the Olympic stadium\u201d. \u2018Japanese academia is more open to non-Japanese professors\u2019 We asked readers to share their thoughts about how Tokyo was changing. Laurence Williams, associate professor in the Faculty of Foreign Studies at Sophia University, a private university in Chiyoda ward in central Tokyo, said: Japanese academia is much more open to non-Japanese professors than it used to be. Tokyo itself is diverse and exciting and this is a great time to be working in the city. Numbers of international students are rising sharply (because of demographic decline, universities are increasingly looking abroad). Most international students are still from elsewhere in Asia, although US/UK/Europe numbers are rising.\u201d Old Japan and new Japan Susannah, who lives in Shibuya, sent in this photo of the Imperial Palace from across the water, and writes: \u201cThis is just after New Years, and shows an impressive contrast between nature, old Japan, and new Japan.\u201d \u2018Is this racism? Yes, but not, I think, in a straightforward way\u2019 David Chart wrote in to say that he served on Kawasaki City committees dealing with issues affecting foreign residents, and reckons the treatment of them hasn\u2019t changed. A couple of years ago he helped organise a survey of foreign residents living in Kawasaki to find out problems they were facing. In a blogpost at the time about the survey results, he said the Japanese police occasionally single out foreigners due to their race, and ask them questions, and \u201csometimes they make them call their mothers\u201d. He told Guardian Cities: \u201cThe composition of the foreign population has changed a lot even while I have been here, but the problems they face have changed much less. Is this racism? Yes, but not, I think, in a straightforward way. \u2018Central housing estates are experiencing a renaissance\u2019 On Tuesday we published an investigation by Guardian Cities and the Waseda Chronicle into how Tokyo\u2019s suburban housing became vast ghettoes for elderly people. Reader Lewis Parley wrote in to say: Your article about the aging population of Tokyo\u2019s suburban housing estates was very informative. I think it would be beneficial to the series if you contrast this phenomenon with the renaissance some more central public housing estates are experiencing due to the influx of immigrant families ( Chinese in Kawaguchi, Indian/ Bangladeshi in Ojima, Koto-ku and Kasai, Edogawa-ku). By also featuring these places, I think you\u2019d give the reader a more balanced picture of the changes Tokyo\u2019s population is experiencing.\u201d During the week, people shared photos of their favourite and suprising Tokyo scenes on Twitter and Instagram, such as these posts: \u2018It had become a building site\u2019 Trevor Skingle got in touch to describe the tension he\u2019d observed between modernisation, and the desire to preserve the city\u2019s heritage. Take for instance the old \u2018Habutae Dango\u2019 that was located near Nippori Station with its 200-year-old history as a tea house and dango (sweet dumpling shop), a favourite haunt of the poet Masaoka Shiki and the author Natsume Soseki, and repository of a few Shogitai relics from the 1868 Battle of Ueno. Each time I visited Tokyo I would make a point of visiting to enjoy their dango and matcha green tea whilst at the same time contemplating the wonderful garden view available only to patrons only to find on my visit in 2018 that it had become a building site.\u201d On the other hand, he adds: \u201cAs a Tokyo history buff I am astonished at some of the historical finds that I\u2019ve made which are still there.\u201d Guardian Cities is live in Tokyo for a special week of in-depth reporting.

Last year the number of indies on UK high streets grew for the second year running \u2013 by 15 to 883, according to the <a href=\"https://www.booksellers.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Booksellers Association</a>. As a reader, writer and literary salon host, I\u2019m delighted. As a person genuinely worried that Donald Trump believes <em>The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</em> is a how-to book, I\u2019m relieved.</p> <p>This resurgence is partly thanks to <a href=\"https://indiebookshopweek.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Independent Bookshop Week</a>, which started on Saturday and runs to 22 June. Across Britain and Ireland indies are doing what they do best: hosting readings and signings, cooking up literary lunches and generally feeding curiosity.

Now based at the Savoy, my salon is simple \u2013 a mix of established and emerging writers read new work, then we talk about it and them too. Nowadays, readers want to meet writers (whether writers like it or not). I\u2019m lucky enough to love it and have toured over 50 indies since my novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/06/you-will-be-safe-here-damian-barr-review\" title=\"\">You Will Be Safe Here</a></em> came out in April.</p> <p>Much Ado Books in Alfriston very kindly put me up in their barn while I finished the last draft.

As for getting a place in the window \u2013 for that your book must enter the very soul of the bookseller (or sell 1,000 copies a day \u00e0 la <em>Pinch Of Nom</em>).

      "bodyText": "As global temperatures rise at the rate political standards fall, the news that independent bookshops are reviving gives rare cause for celebration. Last year the number of indies on UK high streets grew for the second year running \u2013 by 15 to 883, according to the Booksellers Association. As a reader, writer and literary salon host, I\u2019m delighted. As a person genuinely worried that Donald Trump believes The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is a how-to book, I\u2019m relieved. This resurgence is partly thanks to Independent Bookshop Week, which started on Saturday and runs to 22 June. Across Britain and Ireland indies are doing what they do best: hosting readings and signings, cooking up literary lunches and generally feeding curiosity. Bookshop crawls are quite the thing now and you can join one locally or engage in literary tourism farther afield. Check the hashtag or just join a convoy of people with Books are my Bag totes \u2013 I refuse to wash the Tracey Emin special edition. Reading is solitary and social \u2013 for over 10 years I\u2019ve hosted literary salons inspired by Madame de Pompadour and the 18th-century salonni\u00e8res. Now based at the Savoy, my salon is simple \u2013 a mix of established and emerging writers read new work, then we talk about it and them too. Nowadays, readers want to meet writers (whether writers like it or not). I\u2019m lucky enough to love it and have toured over 50 indies since my novel You Will Be Safe Here came out in April. Much Ado Books in Alfriston very kindly put me up in their barn while I finished the last draft. At Lighthouse Books in Edinburgh I played fetch with Artemis, the bookshop dog, while perusing their radial shelves \u2013 a bookshop pet really helps trade, the cuter the better. I read at Shakespeare &amp; Company in Paris the evening after Notre Dame burned and saw how powerfully stories give a community a reason to connect \u2013 it was packed with Parisians glad to have the chance to sit and listen and reflect. Every month, my salon celebrates a different indie. Past favourites include Booka in Oswestry, The Edge of the World in Penzance and Golden Hare in Edinburgh \u2013 winner of this year\u2019s Independent Bookshop of the Year at the British Book Awards. As it is Pride Month we\u2019re showcasing Category Is Books in Glasgow. One of the newest to open its doors, it is owned and run by wife-and-wife team Charlotte and Fionn Duffy-Scott: \u201cWe\u2019re a specialist queer bookshop \u2013 we only stock books that have LGBTQIA+ characters, narratives, or were created by somebody in the community. We don\u2019t stock anything that we feel is homophobic, transphobic, biphobic, misogynistic, terf-y, racist or fascist.\u201d No Ayn Rand or Ann Widdecombe there and quite right too. After all, you wouldn\u2019t walk into travel bookshop Stanfords and ask for a cookbook. To reduce bookshops to selling is to mistake writing for typing or reading as a workout for your eyes. The best indies don\u2019t stock everything \u2013 every book must fight a sort of intellectual Hunger Games to win a space on the shelves. As for getting a place in the window \u2013 for that your book must enter the very soul of the bookseller (or sell 1,000 copies a day \u00e0 la Pinch Of Nom). Space is at a premium but every indie can order you anything and get it for the next day. If you get to know them, they get to know you and your tastes far better than any algorithm can. Indies that don\u2019t just survive but thrive do so because they celebrate and anchor a community \u2013 Gay\u2019s the Word, Crediton Community Bookshop, The Second Shelf.

      "body": "<p>Rachel Taylor had booked a holiday cottage in the Lake District as a treat for her mother. Two weeks before their holiday her father became seriously ill and she had to cancel. He died soon afterwards. Since the payment was non-refundable, Taylor claimed the \u00a3646 cost on her travel insurance. To her astonishment, she was told that she was only entitled to half that. </p> <p>\u201cI was told it was because there were two people travelling, and my policy paid out on a per-person basis,\u201d she says. \u201cI argued that the cost for the week was \u00a3646 for the cottage, irrespective of the number of people, the entire booking was in my name only and I was the only person who had suffered any financial loss. How can my mum be expected to make a claim when her name does not appear anywhere on the booking confirmation?\u201d</p> <p>Taylor is one of thousands of holidaymakers who find themselves left out of pocket by caveats tucked away in the small print of travel insurance.</p> <p>As insurers compete to offer the lowest prices on comparison websites, fees and exclusions have been quietly rising. Inflated excess charges, inadequate cover for illness or cancellation, and refusal to pay out for lost possessions without proof of ownership can make a cheap policy costly. Some companies use the omission of a middle name, or failure to declare an inconsequential past ailment, as an excuse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15125ab151022cb71f614e6664fd58dedd467fc4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15125ab151022cb71f614e6664fd58dedd467fc4/0_241_1599_959/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julie Annakin and her husband David\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julie Annakin and her husband David in Sydney. She ran into trouble with her Nationwide travel insurance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the Annakin family</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last year, the <em>Observer</em> reported the case of Juliet Thomas, who was left with a bill of \u00a330,000 after being diagnosed with a kidney tumour while on holiday. Her insurer, Coverwise, refused to cover the cost because she had failed to declare a previous prescription of sleeping tablets when buying the policy.</p> <p>Although her brief insomnia was unrelated to the tumour, Coverwise\u2019s underwriter, Axa, insisted it disqualified her because she had bought a basic policy designed for those with no recent health issues.</p> <p>Axa was also the underwriter for Taylor\u2019s American Express annual gold policy. The company told the <em>Observer</em>: \u201cTo keep premiums down, most travel insurers only pay for the insured person\u2019s proportion if a trip is cancelled \u2013 additional travellers will need to submit their own claims. This is one of the many reasons every person should be fully insured.\u201d</p> <p>Axa has since paid Taylor the full cost of the holiday.</p> <p>Onerous excess charges are one of the most common stings.

      "bodyText": "Rachel Taylor had booked a holiday cottage in the Lake District as a treat for her mother. Two weeks before their holiday her father became seriously ill and she had to cancel. He died soon afterwards. Since the payment was non-refundable, Taylor claimed the \u00a3646 cost on her travel insurance. To her astonishment, she was told that she was only entitled to half that. \u201cI was told it was because there were two people travelling, and my policy paid out on a per-person basis,\u201d she says. \u201cI argued that the cost for the week was \u00a3646 for the cottage, irrespective of the number of people, the entire booking was in my name only and I was the only person who had suffered any financial loss. How can my mum be expected to make a claim when her name does not appear anywhere on the booking confirmation?\u201d Taylor is one of thousands of holidaymakers who find themselves left out of pocket by caveats tucked away in the small print of travel insurance. As insurers compete to offer the lowest prices on comparison websites, fees and exclusions have been quietly rising. Inflated excess charges, inadequate cover for illness or cancellation, and refusal to pay out for lost possessions without proof of ownership can make a cheap policy costly. Some companies use the omission of a middle name, or failure to declare an inconsequential past ailment, as an excuse. Last year, the Observer reported the case of Juliet Thomas, who was left with a bill of \u00a330,000 after being diagnosed with a kidney tumour while on holiday. Her insurer, Coverwise, refused to cover the cost because she had failed to declare a previous prescription of sleeping tablets when buying the policy. Although her brief insomnia was unrelated to the tumour, Coverwise\u2019s underwriter, Axa, insisted it disqualified her because she had bought a basic policy designed for those with no recent health issues. Axa was also the underwriter for Taylor\u2019s American Express annual gold policy. The company told the Observer: \u201cTo keep premiums down, most travel insurers only pay for the insured person\u2019s proportion if a trip is cancelled \u2013 additional travellers will need to submit their own claims. This is one of the many reasons every person should be fully insured.\u201d Axa has since paid Taylor the full cost of the holiday. Onerous excess charges are one of the most common stings. These can be as much as \u00a3300 and some insurers apply them to different parts of a single claim. If a handbag is stolen with a phone and purse inside, the phone and bag would be classed under \u201cpersonal possessions\u201d and cash under \u201cpersonal money\u201d, with an excess payable on both. Others charge for each person on a policy even if it\u2019s a single claim, rendering some cover worthless. A family of four claiming \u00a31,000 cancellation cover could face a combined excess of \u00a31,200 \u2013 more than the cost of their trip. Julie Annakin was on holiday with her husband when his wallet containing \u00a3200 was stolen. \u201cI contacted Nationwide to claim on our FlexPlus policy,\u201d she says. \u201cI was asked who the money belonged to and replied it was both of us.

One is, the other will be, pope.</p> <p>Ratzinger is Pope Benedict XVI, the arch-conservative, once nicknamed God\u2019s rottweiler.

Set-up scenes (in Rome and Buenos Aires), in which each confides in a religious sister to bring out his backstory, are overlong and creaky.

Bergoglio is Argentinian, fanatical about football, knows the words to Yellow Submarine and dances the tango at least once a week. If they were a couple, they would be odd. But this relationship is more intricate and odder than that of any couple: both men incarnate opposite poles of a single role. One is, the other will be, pope. Ratzinger is Pope Benedict XVI, the arch-conservative, once nicknamed God\u2019s rottweiler. Cardinal Bergoglio is the outspoken advocate of change who believes the duty of the church is to give food to the starving \u2013 bread of heaven and of Earth to those bombarded in Syria, washed up on Lampedusa, abandoned in hospitals. Extraordinarily, the rule keeper, Benedict, wants to violate a Catholic tradition unbroken for more than 700 years: he wants to resign. Is Bergoglio the man to take his place? The heart of the play is in the encounters between the two men in the Vatican. Set-up scenes (in Rome and Buenos Aires), in which each confides in a religious sister to bring out his backstory, are overlong and creaky. They lend the action a Jesuit-style, propagation-of-the-faith-piece feel. What powers the production are the second-half exchanges between the two prelates as they confront one another\u2019s different ways of living their experience of God and the church in the world. As directed by James Dacre, Anton Lesser (Benedict) and Nicholas Woodeson (Bergoglio) seem to reveal, in fits and starts and flashes, the tattered, torn and patched-together souls of these aged men who have experienced depths of sin and have struggled to find self-forgiveness (performances not to be missed). When they finally find a way forward, through compassion and acceptance of change, it is not just as popes present and future, but as people facing up to the complexities of existence. \u2022 At the Royal &amp; Derngate, Northampton, until 22 June",

      "body": "<p>Shortly before Samuel Beckett died in 1989, he received a request to name a new drama company and its theatre after him. Playwrights and thespians are habitually immortalised in this way \u2013 London can currently count the Pinter, Coward, Olivier, Gielgud and Garrick theatres, among others. But Beckett was not being asked to give his name to a gilded West End playhouse, an overture he would doubtless have detested and declined. Sala Beckett in Barcelona, founded by the actor Luis Miguel Climent and playwright Jos\u00e9 Sanchis Sinisterra, is as far from the plush velvet orthodoxies of commercial theatre as it is possible to imagine.</p> <p>Sala Beckett occupies a remodelled workers\u2019 cooperative building in Poblenou, a former industrial quarter wedged between the sea and the heart of Barcelona. In Spanish, <em>sala</em> means simply a room or hall. \u201cIt\u2019s a space for creation and encounter,\u201d says current director, Toni Casares. \u201cIt\u2019s not a listings theatre that opens its shutters 10 minutes before the performance and closes them again as soon as the audience has left. It\u2019s a space where things occur, where things are cooking throughout the day.\u201d Standing apart from the conventions of the industry and the culture of leisure, Sala Beckett puts on plays, but it also \u201cshapes, experiments, searches and manipulates time\u201d.</p> <p>Beckett\u2019s subversive dissection of the human condition through the precise and visceral deployment of language, rather than scenography, runs like a darkly glittering seam through the workings of his eponymous theatre. Sala Beckett envisages the training of playwrights and the staging of performances to be innately conjoined, inviting audiences, who are not just seen as \u201ccustomers for an industrial product\u201d, to sit in on rehearsals and engage with actors. For Beckett, a supremely radical artist whose polymorphic writings sought to express \u201ca condition of essentialism\u201d, it seems a particularly apt afterlife.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31e09c0db8b3b603345ae4fae87ebdc3ff7b57d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31e09c0db8b3b603345ae4fae87ebdc3ff7b57d7/0_0_8681_8762/991.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Conspicuous traces of use\u2019: inside Flores &amp; Prats\u2019s Sala Beckett in Barcelona.\" width=\"991\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Conspicuous traces of use\u2019: inside Flores &amp; Prats\u2019s Sala Beckett in Barcelona.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adria Goula</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The physical setting for this afterlife was created by Barcelona-based architects Ricardo Flores and Eva Prats, pillars of the Catalan architectural world, whose oeuvre reverberates with lineages and cross-fertilisations.

Other architects in the competition proposed demolishing it, but Flores &amp; Prats felt the building and its history epitomised the provisional spirit of Sala Beckett, with its quotidian rituals of work and discovery, where art evolves over time. Mortality and the passing of time were critical themes of Beckett\u2019s work.</p> <p><em>What Where</em>, the epigrammatic title of Beckett\u2019s final play, is also the title of a new exhibition that considers the architecture of Sala Beckett. Some elements were shown at last year\u2019s architecture biennale in Venice, but this presents a new perspective, focusing more intently on the relationship with Beckett. \u201cIt\u2019s been an opportunity to find out how the design of a theatre relates to the activities taking place within it: writing and making theatre inspired by one of the 20th century\u2019s greatest writers,\u201d says curator Vicky Richardson. In an era of ossifying political mindsets, borders and national identities, Beckett, an Irishman who wrote in French, spent time in London and Paris and gave his name to a Catalan theatre company, still stands for confrontational modernity and the persistence of fluidly transnational culture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"973de7852e995b1f7b95310dd81e64a256bb3220\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/973de7852e995b1f7b95310dd81e64a256bb3220/0_0_11560_5780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"inside Flores & Prats\u2019s Sala Beckett in Barcelona.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Somewhat surreally, What Where the exhibition is set in the Roca Gallery in west London, which was designed by Zaha Hadid, whose obsession with sterile, computer-generated form is the polar opposite of the tactile, hand-drawn approach of Flores &amp; Prats.

      "body": "<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-liverpool/exhibition/keith-haring\" title=\"\">Keith Haring</a></strong>, at Tate Liverpool, is a true surprise: a show of unexpected jubilance and beauty. The American artist was only 31 when he died in 1990, and it is almost beyond belief that some of the most vital images in this enormous exhibition were painted when he was living with Aids. But for a British audience who know him through the instantly recognisable graphics, undimmed down the years through the use of timeless black and white on everything from T-shirts and posters to Reebok sneakers, at least part of the pleasure is the sheer power of them, writ large and in radiant colour.</p> <p>Radiance \u2013 and the radiating black lines scintillating around Haring\u2019s simplified images of lovers, tellies, barking dogs and his <a href=\"https://wepresent.wetransfer.com/story/yes-but-why-keith-haring/\" title=\"\">trademark baby</a>, crawling ever-onwards \u2013 is the overwhelming effect of this art. It is achieved entirely through line and colour. Just two elements \u2013 and even one, if you consider the original chalk drawings he made on vacant subway hoardings in New York in the early 1980s. Somehow, two of these have been preserved like chunks of the Berlin Wall and are shown here alongside fabulous photographs of the speccy young Haring darting about with his chalk to the fascination of passing passengers.</p> <p>He was a performance artist of every kind \u2013 dancer to DJ to action painter \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.haring.com/!/pop-shop\" title=\"\">from the start</a>. A video called <em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/arteideorg/status/578337091584716802\" title=\"\">Painting Myself Into a Corner</a></em> shows Haring at 21, working the paper-lined floor of his studio with dynamic black brushstrokes. He leaps off from Pollock to pop. Discarded hoardings become substrates for his dazzling paintings of a chortling Mickey Mouse and figures sprouting TV sets for heads. Workmen\u2019s tarpaulins were cheap canvases for his buzzing hieroglyphics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d722b5d577071e02c674b90be0d65456e78d427b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d722b5d577071e02c674b90be0d65456e78d427b/0_0_2953_1987/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Keith Haring in subway car (New York), c1983.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keith Haring in subway car (New York), c1983.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tseng Kwong Chi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And anyone visiting Tate Liverpool will immediately sense the connection with ancient Egypt. This is not far-fetched. Haring studied semiotics, and was a sophisticated consumer of world cultures from Dr Seuss to Japanese watercolours, Aboriginal drawings to African cave art. The terrific directness of his work is derived, at the very least, from looking at the paintings of the French modernist <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/jean-dubuffet-1035\" title=\"\">Jean Dubuffet</a> as much as Walt Disney.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For all the violence he warned against, and drew, there is an equal message of love</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To begin with, Haring\u2019s lexicon of picture-words seems ebulliently clear. The baby is all perfection and innocence. The <a href=\"https://www.mcgawgraphics.com/products/keith-haring-untitled-1987-dance\" title=\"\">dancing men</a> are freedom, rebellion, joy, release. The cross symbols \u2013 both mathematical and religious \u2013 mean exactly what they stand for.

      "bodyText": "Keith Haring, at Tate Liverpool, is a true surprise: a show of unexpected jubilance and beauty. The American artist was only 31 when he died in 1990, and it is almost beyond belief that some of the most vital images in this enormous exhibition were painted when he was living with Aids. But for a British audience who know him through the instantly recognisable graphics, undimmed down the years through the use of timeless black and white on everything from T-shirts and posters to Reebok sneakers, at least part of the pleasure is the sheer power of them, writ large and in radiant colour. Radiance \u2013 and the radiating black lines scintillating around Haring\u2019s simplified images of lovers, tellies, barking dogs and his trademark baby, crawling ever-onwards \u2013 is the overwhelming effect of this art. It is achieved entirely through line and colour. Just two elements \u2013 and even one, if you consider the original chalk drawings he made on vacant subway hoardings in New York in the early 1980s. Somehow, two of these have been preserved like chunks of the Berlin Wall and are shown here alongside fabulous photographs of the speccy young Haring darting about with his chalk to the fascination of passing passengers. He was a performance artist of every kind \u2013 dancer to DJ to action painter \u2013 from the start. A video called Painting Myself Into a Corner shows Haring at 21, working the paper-lined floor of his studio with dynamic black brushstrokes. He leaps off from Pollock to pop. Discarded hoardings become substrates for his dazzling paintings of a chortling Mickey Mouse and figures sprouting TV sets for heads. Workmen\u2019s tarpaulins were cheap canvases for his buzzing hieroglyphics. And anyone visiting Tate Liverpool will immediately sense the connection with ancient Egypt. This is not far-fetched. Haring studied semiotics, and was a sophisticated consumer of world cultures from Dr Seuss to Japanese watercolours, Aboriginal drawings to African cave art. The terrific directness of his work is derived, at the very least, from looking at the paintings of the French modernist Jean Dubuffet as much as Walt Disney. To begin with, Haring\u2019s lexicon of picture-words seems ebulliently clear. The baby is all perfection and innocence. The dancing men are freedom, rebellion, joy, release. The cross symbols \u2013 both mathematical and religious \u2013 mean exactly what they stand for. All the television sets in a colossal ziggurat, presided over by angry gods, bear nothing but crosses on their screens: wrong, wrong, wrong. A man falling down a staircase, black on nuclear yellow, is literally a warning sign. Haring develops diagrams of cause and effect. Sometimes they are the visual equivalent of syllogisms: money causes greed, which causes violence, which causes death. But not everything is quite so black and white. Flying saucers in DayGlo colours seem to have a benevolent place in his art, as if they carried exotic outsiders. Dogs \u2013 dancing, barking, glowing \u2013 are animal, human and mythical. In a work from 1983, Haring painted a caterpillar with an early PC for a head. Perhaps it will turn into a butterfly, more likely a monster. On screen is a poor little man being caught by the tail. Haring had the strongest presentiment of the couch generation, of human beings enslaved by screens of all shapes and sizes. It seems all wrong that so many people now experience his work reduced to the size of their iPhone case. The big works are huge; specifically the massive black and white ink drawing The Matrix, a kind of fizzing-all-over collage of Haring\u2019s every emblem and symbol, which runs the full length of a gallery wall like riotous graffiti.

      "body": "<p><strong><a href=\"https://bridgetheatre.co.uk/whats-on/a-midsummer-nights-dream/\" title=\"\">A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream</a></strong> is often staged as a daydream \u2013 wild eglantine, gossamer wings, summer light. But Nicholas Hytner\u2019s wild, immersive and original production, without sacrificing comedy, reintroduces \u201cblack-browed night\u201d and emphasises the play\u2019s sexual anarchy. He takes as many liberties as Puck himself, including the handing over of Titania\u2019s lines to Oberon, which, although startling, works intriguingly well and is in keeping with a comedy built on permissive suitor-swapping.</p> <p>The opening startles too: it\u2019s more Margaret Atwood\u2019s <em>The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</em> than Shakespearean comedy. Smart choirs \u2013 women in nuns\u2019 habits, men in suits \u2013 are \u201cchanting faint hymns\u201d. A promenading audience is drawn into this puritanical cult. Perhaps this is a world suggested by Theseus\u2019s threat to Hermia about having to \u201cendure the life of a nun\u201d. Perhaps the unruliest dreams arise out of repressive conditions.</p> <p>Hippolyta is raised high above the heads of the audience in a glass booth \u2013 as in a gone-wrong fairy-tale. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/13/game-of-thrones-brienne-gwendoline-christie-changed-life\" title=\"\">Gwendoline Christie</a> plays her with her own brand of weird magic and intensity. This is redoubled as she takes on Titania in a dress like a green silk bank on the move, complete with glittering corsage. Languidly sculptural, she leans from her swing (a nod at Peter Brook\u2019s famous production) to play havoc with the mortals below.</p> <p>Designer Bunny Christie is fearlessly in charge of levitating, ivy-entwined brass beds that alarm as much as any circus act. And there is no shortage of actual circus acts as sleazily glamorous aerialists play the fairies and sensuously doodle in the air, dropping from their cloth perches like hieroglyphs \u2013 a wonder to behold.</p> <p>But at the heart of the evening is a show-stealing Bottom. Upstaging, let us not forget, is Bottom\u2019s ambition: he wants to take on all the parts in the mechanicals\u2019 play. Hammed Animashaun\u2019s simple egotism in the role is adorably jovial and after turning donkey, his laugh disarmingly hangs on to being human before descending into a bray.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d016e9a2e6714717c20bda1acf6c52200004ff4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d016e9a2e6714717c20bda1acf6c52200004ff4/0_0_4334_3250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hammed Animashaun as Bottom.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The show-stealing Hammed Animashaun as Bottom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Harlan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In this production, it is Oberon who becomes besotted with Bottom. As Oberon, Oliver Chris starts off uncontroversially before getting hilariously and uninhibitedly into the groove, especially in an unforgettable airborne bath scene, complete with bubbles, champagne and ongoing delusion. Bottom endears himself to us by falling in good-naturedly with his new amour. David Moorst\u2019s Puck is riveting: ratty, creaturely, all nervous blink and twitch but with a delinquent grace. At one point, he dives into the audience\u2019s human safety net.</p> <p>The lovers are conventionally cast: a tall, flaxen Helena (Tessa Bonham Jones at home in the role); a dark, doe-eyed Hermia (an excellent Isis Hainsworth, like a child lost in the woods). Lysander (Kit Young) and Demetrius (Paul Adeyefa) are cast like dashing brothers who dally, briefly, with one another. It\u2019s an evening of unsafe magic, exuberantly offset with hits \u2013 Jimmy Cliff\u2019s I Can See Clearly Now, Florence and the Machine\u2019s Only If For a Night, Dizzee Rascal\u2019s Bonkers.

      "bodyText": "A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream is often staged as a daydream \u2013 wild eglantine, gossamer wings, summer light. But Nicholas Hytner\u2019s wild, immersive and original production, without sacrificing comedy, reintroduces \u201cblack-browed night\u201d and emphasises the play\u2019s sexual anarchy. He takes as many liberties as Puck himself, including the handing over of Titania\u2019s lines to Oberon, which, although startling, works intriguingly well and is in keeping with a comedy built on permissive suitor-swapping. The opening startles too: it\u2019s more Margaret Atwood\u2019s The Handmaid\u2019s Tale than Shakespearean comedy. Smart choirs \u2013 women in nuns\u2019 habits, men in suits \u2013 are \u201cchanting faint hymns\u201d. A promenading audience is drawn into this puritanical cult. Perhaps this is a world suggested by Theseus\u2019s threat to Hermia about having to \u201cendure the life of a nun\u201d. Perhaps the unruliest dreams arise out of repressive conditions. Hippolyta is raised high above the heads of the audience in a glass booth \u2013 as in a gone-wrong fairy-tale. Gwendoline Christie plays her with her own brand of weird magic and intensity. This is redoubled as she takes on Titania in a dress like a green silk bank on the move, complete with glittering corsage. Languidly sculptural, she leans from her swing (a nod at Peter Brook\u2019s famous production) to play havoc with the mortals below. Designer Bunny Christie is fearlessly in charge of levitating, ivy-entwined brass beds that alarm as much as any circus act. And there is no shortage of actual circus acts as sleazily glamorous aerialists play the fairies and sensuously doodle in the air, dropping from their cloth perches like hieroglyphs \u2013 a wonder to behold. But at the heart of the evening is a show-stealing Bottom. Upstaging, let us not forget, is Bottom\u2019s ambition: he wants to take on all the parts in the mechanicals\u2019 play. Hammed Animashaun\u2019s simple egotism in the role is adorably jovial and after turning donkey, his laugh disarmingly hangs on to being human before descending into a bray. In this production, it is Oberon who becomes besotted with Bottom. As Oberon, Oliver Chris starts off uncontroversially before getting hilariously and uninhibitedly into the groove, especially in an unforgettable airborne bath scene, complete with bubbles, champagne and ongoing delusion. Bottom endears himself to us by falling in good-naturedly with his new amour. David Moorst\u2019s Puck is riveting: ratty, creaturely, all nervous blink and twitch but with a delinquent grace. At one point, he dives into the audience\u2019s human safety net. The lovers are conventionally cast: a tall, flaxen Helena (Tessa Bonham Jones at home in the role); a dark, doe-eyed Hermia (an excellent Isis Hainsworth, like a child lost in the woods). Lysander (Kit Young) and Demetrius (Paul Adeyefa) are cast like dashing brothers who dally, briefly, with one another. It\u2019s an evening of unsafe magic, exuberantly offset with hits \u2013 Jimmy Cliff\u2019s I Can See Clearly Now, Florence and the Machine\u2019s Only If For a Night, Dizzee Rascal\u2019s Bonkers. You would not want all your Midsummer Night\u2019s Dreams like this but it\u2019s a legitimately dark, energetic dream, and there is always something to delight, amaze or alarm \u2013 it is not only Bottom who is \u201ctransported\u201d. And when, at the end, large moon balloons are tossed into the crowd, it seems the party will go on forever. I found myself calculating: five stars might not be enough. How about throwing in an extra moon? Suitor-swapping also drives Terence Rattigan\u2019s 1943 drawing-room comedy While the Sun Shines. What the butler sees in the bedroom is revealed only by the butler\u2019s rolling eyes (John Hudson is spot on). The show, divertingly directed by Paul Miller, stars the beguiling Philip Labey as the Earl of Harpenden, a leading man who prefers not to lead, with splendid back up from Julian Moore-Cook as Lieutenant Mulvaney, a Yankee who seems too big for the genteel flat in which he finds himself and Lieutenant Colbert, a disputatious Frenchman (amusing Jordan Mifs\u00fad needs only to fine-tune his accent). Dorothea Myer-Bennett is sultry \u2013 and no fool \u2013 as Mabel Crum, the \u201ctrollop\u201d, and Sabrina Bartlett comically earnest (except when tipsy) as Elizabeth, the girl who causes all the trouble. The lightest of light entertainment. Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike, by Christopher Durang, was a Tony-award winning hit on Broadway in 2013. Directed by Walter Bobbie, the comedy leans on Chekhov and sometimes loses its balance (as if Chekhov did not wish to oblige by becoming a prop).

But it is Mark Hadfield\u2019s Vanya, a tentative and depressive writer, who saves the night when he delivers a tremendous monologue of nostalgia, grief and fear for the planet. Until that moment, I had been contemplating leaving Bath for Moscow.

Despite having no prior interest in (or knowledge of) F1, I found <em>Senna</em> both informative and engaging \u2013 a riveting portrait of a man whose high-speed achievements had previously meant nothing to me. For his latest work, Kapadia has once again focused on a sport in which I have no emotional investment \u2013 football. Yet watching this typically punchy portrait of Argentina\u2019s most infamous sporting son, I found myself gripped by a universally accessible tale of a divided soul \u2013 a figure whose dual personas are embodied in the two names of the film\u2019s title; Diego and Maradona.</p> \n<p>Kapadia opens his film in breathless, bravura style \u2013 a frenetic car-chase through the crowded streets of Naples (<em>The Italian Job</em> meets <em>The French Connection</em>), which snappily gets us up to speed with Maradona\u2019s shooting-star career prior to his big-bucks transfer to Napoli in 1984. A head-spinning montage of sights (excruciating ankle injuries) and sounds (Pel\u00e9 declaring that his spiritual successor \u201cisn\u2019t psychologically prepared yet\u201d) plunge us into the melee of an overcrowded press conference, where this underdog city unveils its most expensive signing.</p> \n<p>\u201cI would like to know,\u201d says the French journalist who gets in the first question, \u2018if Maradona knows what the Camorra is\u2026\u201d It\u2019s a provocative gambit, and the young footballer, caught in the glare of the cameras and flashbulbs, looks baffled. It also perfectly sets out Kapadia\u2019s stall; a tale of rags and riches, saints and sinners, crime and football, injury and victory, all played out against the backdrop of the city that comes to embody his divided spirit.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We are shown the thin line between adoration and abjection that anyone who lives their life in public must walk</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Trainer Fernando Signorini provides the key that unlocks this duality.

Throughout all of the high-profile triumphs and scandals that ensue (drug busts, disqualifications, affairs, contested offspring etc), Kapadia keeps this dynamic tension to the fore, reminding us of Maradona\u2019s roots, juxtaposing the extravagant lifestyle that made him headline news with the hard-knocks reality of his background.</p> \n<p>Having grown up in the poverty of Villa Fiorito, south of central Buenos Aires, sporting prodigy Diego effectively provided for his family from the age of 15.

Here, straightforward prettiness often abounds, particularly on the country-leaning tracks, some with the odd female backing coo. It\u2019s sufficient to support the idea of this 16th LP (his first 11 were under the name Smog) as a domestic pastorale. But Callahan\u2019s gnomic half-smile and his ability to pull the rug out under certainties remain. The shepherd\u2019s in a sheepskin waistcoat, after all \u2013 capable of betrayal.",

      "body": "<p>For the first time in his life, Ken Livingstone didn\u2019t vote Labour at the European elections last month. But don\u2019t panic: he didn\u2019t vote Liberal Democrat either. Not for him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/31/alastair-campbell-labour-expulsion-discrimination-appeal\" title=\"\">the (supposed) treachery of Alastair Campbell.</a> In fact, he didn\u2019t vote at all. The former mayor of London was in Angola, making a speech to the World Tourism Forum, a trip that came up at the last moment, leaving him with no time to arrange a postal vote. Did the result, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/28/remainers-eu-elections-second-brexit-referendum\" title=\"\">disastrous for both Labour and the Tories</a>, shock him? (In west Africa for less than 24 hours, he was back in good time for the TV coverage.) No, not at all. It struck him as utterly predictable and he sees no cause for concern on the Labour side. \u201cI think there\u2019s a consensus now that Labour have got to campaign for the UK to remain in the EU,\u201d he insists, as if such a position was the most straightforward thing in the world. (It isn\u2019t, especially since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/07/peterborough-byelection-result-labour-sees-off-brexit-party-threat-to-hold-seat\" title=\"\">byelection in Peterborough</a>, a constituency that voted strongly to leave, which Labour managed to win.)</p> <p>Livingstone\u2019s old comrade Jeremy Corbyn, whose fence-sitting in this matter barely serves to conceal his Leaver tendencies, will soon, he believes, have other things on his mind than the question of Europe. \u201cJeremy has always been a critic of the EU,\u201d he says, almost fondly (Livingstone voted Remain in the referendum, \u201cwithout any doubt\u201d in his mind at all). \u201cAnd half of Labour MPs are in seats that voted to leave, so they thought they\u2019d have to respect that. But I think that\u2019s all behind us now. There isn\u2019t a majority in parliament for leaving without a deal and the Tories are going to elect a leader who will go for a hard Brexit. So there must be a prospect of a general election soon.\u201d Labour will, he claims, win this election and thereafter it will swiftly become clear that Brexit was merely \u201ca brief diversion\u201d. Britain will stay in the EU and Corbyn and John McDonnell will then set about leading what he believes will be the best and most reforming Labour government since that of Clement Attlee in 1945.</p> <p>Crikey. As conversations go, this one has certainly kicked off at high speed. What makes it all the more dizzying \u2013 the idea that Brexit is just a \u201cbrief diversion\u201d strikes me as preposterous, if not a touch mad \u2013 is that it is so unexpected. For one thing, Livingstone is ostensibly here to talk about <em>Livingstone\u2019s London: A Celebration of People and Places</em>, a gentle little book full of historical statistics and stuff about blue plaques that he has written for a new publishing company set up by his wife\u2019s two sisters; before our meeting was fixed, we were told that he wasn\u2019t keen to talk about politics. For another, his words, punchy and far reaching, are somewhat at odds with his bearing. He\u2019s perfectly affable, a smile permanently spread across his face, but there\u2019s something rather frail and depleted about him, too: if he talks proudly of being a house-husband, behind the boast it\u2019s possible to detect a certain purposelessness and sense of loss. His wide, royal blue braces only add to this effect. They seem to belong to another man altogether.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Politicians don\u2019t answer questions any more. That\u2019s one of the reasons why Farage has done so well</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He and I meet in a private club in Soho (neither of us is a member) on the morning of Trump\u2019s visit \u2013 and yes, if he wasn\u2019t seeing me, he would be out there protesting alongside Corbyn. \u201cThis is the worst president of my lifetime,\u201d he says. \u201cA most irrational man and if things go wrong, we\u2019re going to have a bloody war.\u201d He travelled here on the tube and will return home the same way; he never learned to drive and no, he has never ridden a Boris bike, either. Outside, a pneumatic drill attacks another London street, but the terrible din seems to affect Livingstone far less than it does me.</p> <p>His answers to my questions are long and digressive, reaching ever further backwards into the past. I have the feeling that whatever lengths he might have gone to when he was mayor to protect his privacy, he rather likes doing interviews. \u201cPoliticians don\u2019t answer questions any more,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons why Farage has done so well. He says what he thinks. When I was campaigning against Boris [to be mayor], one of the things that always amazed me was that he always said what people wanted to hear, whatever the audience.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8e271b8a25584e1667089be4dfd39adb9ba1af7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e271b8a25584e1667089be4dfd39adb9ba1af7a/0_0_3500_1961/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Livingstone campaigning to regain the job of London mayor, 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"560\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Livingstone campaigning to regain the job of London mayor, 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivia Harris/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At whose feet does he lay this trend for half-truths and empty platitudes? Apparently, for this as for so much else, we can blame New Labour: \u201cIt\u2019s the legacy of the Blair era. You tell people what they want to hear.\u201d Livingstone thinks those polls that suggest more people would now vote Remain than Leave are correct, but that this can be put down to the business community rather than politicians: \u201cThe worries of business have got across to people.\u201d If he was a Labour MP in a Leave constituency, he wouldn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cPeople were lied to. If I was an MP, I would be campaigning to say: this was a mistake. We must remain or you will lose your jobs. I suppose they worry that the party will be decimated if they do, but I can\u2019t see the point unless you say what you believe. Only eccentrics like Kate Hoey [the MP for Vauxhall] and John Mann [the MP for Bassetlaw] voted Leave. Everyone else knew how bad it would be for the economy.\u201d</p> <p>Has he said any of this to Corbyn and McDonnell? \u201cThey don\u2019t need my advice. But if they asked, I would tell them.\u201d His greatest regret \u2013 the only regret he is willing to admit to me \u2013 is that he didn\u2019t return to parliament after losing to Boris Johnson for the second time in 2012 (Livingstone was the MP for Brent East from 1987 to 2001) and so won\u2019t be available to join their cabinet. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have ever disagreed about economic issues,\u201d he says. \u201cAs I say, Labour is going to come out in favour of Remain, whether by means of an election or a second referendum. The real issue isn\u2019t the EU. The real issue is that Cameron and May make Thatcher look like a progressive liberal. They have made cuts she would never had dared to. Would she have cut 22,000 police? No, it\u2019s inconceivable.\u201d</p> <p>The way forward is, he thinks, perfectly obvious. \u201cWe do not need to increase taxes on ordinary people to rebuild our state. We just need to stop the super-rich and the corporations that pay no bloody tax. If we make them pay their share, we\u2019ll have all the money we need.\u201d</p> <p>But there may be other reasons why no one asks his advice just lately. Livingstone is not currently a member of the Labour party, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/may/21/ken-livingstone-resignation-labour-party-statement-antisemitism\" title=\"\">having resigned his membership last year </a>because he did not wish to be a \u201cdistraction\u201d following allegations of antisemitism made against him (until then, he had been fighting disciplinary action that followed after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/28/timeline-events-leading-to-ken-livingstone-suspension-labour\" title=\"\">he told the BBC in 2016</a> that in 1932 Hitler had championed Jewish emigration to Israel and was \u201csupporting Zionism before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews\u201d). Does he feel sad about this? \u201cOf course. But the trouble is that when Jeremy became leader the disciplinary unit was stuffed with Blairites, who hate lefties like me. They dragged it out for two years and were clearly planning to drag it out for more. I was just being used to undermine Jeremy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a932fc8bcb9457e0b69fb8b3eb64863eb331623\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a932fc8bcb9457e0b69fb8b3eb64863eb331623/0_0_1901_2025/939.jpg\" alt=\"Celebrating with Denise Lewis in 2005 after London being awarded the 2012 Olympics.\" width=\"939\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Celebrating with Denise Lewis in 2005 after London being awarded the 2012 Olympics.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Phillips/Barcroft Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hmm. I\u2019m not sure I buy this argument, if only because the party expelled Alastair Campbell so quickly \u2013 and simply for having admitted, after the election, that he had not voted Labour (it took them about two seconds). But he\u2019s not to be put off. \u201cThe rules are clear. You can\u2019t support other parties and stay in the Labour party.\u201d Why, then, has no one disciplined his old friend Kate Hoey, who likes to be photographed cosying up to Nigel Farage? He laughs. \u201cI know. When she was a Marxist, I completely agreed with her. But she has bizarre views now.\u201d</p> <p>Still, he\u2019s hopeful that the issue of antisemitism in the party will soon be resolved. To my amazement, he is utterly \u201cdelighted\u201d that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/28/equality-body-launches-investigation-of-labour-antisemitism-claims\" title=\"\">Equalities and Human Rights Commission</a> is formally to investigate whether Labour has unlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimised people because they are Jewish, an inquiry announced last month after it received a number of complaints of antisemitism in the party. \u201cIt\u2019s brilliant,\u201d he says, banging the table so that his coffee cup rattles. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to do a fair investigation, they\u2019re going to find that about 250 members have been found to have tweeted something antisemitic, that about 100 are still under investigation, and that this is about 0.08% of our members.\u201d</p> <p>Even better, the investigation will give him the chance to clear his name, to prove once and for all that journalists have wilfully misquoted him and that he never said Hitler was a Zionist (he did, however, unquestionably say that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/30/ken-livingstone-repeats-claim-nazi-zionist-collaboration\" title=\"\">Hitler supported Zionism</a>). \u201cI\u2019m writing to them. I assume they will want to question me.\u201d</p> <p>What follows, in this part of our conversation, is dispiriting, to put it mildly (and from a man, too, who will later tell me that he has just finished reading Simon Schama\u2019s \u201cquite remarkable\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/08/the-story-of-the-jews-belonging-1492-1900-review-simon-schama-fight-to-fit-in\" title=\"\"><em>The Story of the Jews).</em></a> When I ask him about the experiences of Luciana Berger, the Jewish former Labour MP who required police protection during last year\u2019s Labour party conference, he says only that the abuse she gets \u201con the internet\u201d comes not from party members, but \u201cfrom bigots\u201d (she would doubtless disagree, given the behaviour of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/23/liverpool-wavertree-labour-constituency-antisemitism-luciana-berger-derek-hatton\" title=\"\">some members of her local party</a>). When I ask if he doesn\u2019t see the point made by Margaret Hodge, another Jewish Labour MP, when she notes that the mere fact of the EHRC investigation brings shame on the party, he will respond only off the record. When I ask if some Labour activists don\u2019t wilfully and perniciously conflate Judaism and Zionism, he talks for some while about Ben Gurion, Benjamin Netanyahu and a book called <em>The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine</em>, after which he insists that he wouldn\u2019t know what people say online \u201cbecause I\u2019ve never been on the internet in my life\u201d.</p> <p>In more than 50 years in the Labour party, he never saw or heard anything antisemitic. \u201cIf you\u2019re antisemitic, you\u2019re not going to join the Labour party, are you?\u201d And why\u2019s that? \u201cBecause the most prominent Jewish MPs are Labour MPs.\u201d The allegations against both himself and the Labour party are not upsetting to him, first because he has had \u201c38 years of lies and smears\u201d and, second, because he knows they\u2019re the invention of the media. \u201cYou plough through these stories and there\u2019s almost no examples [of antisemitic abuse].\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9188d8826c12dc1bc5fc9cf02225d5dcf30c4a42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9188d8826c12dc1bc5fc9cf02225d5dcf30c4a42/0_38_3488_2352/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With fellow Labour stalwart John McDonnell in 1982.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"674\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With fellow Labour stalwart John McDonnell in 1982.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ford/Daily Mail/REX Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Livingstone was born in 1945, into a world in which things seemed always to be getting better: \u201cthe luckiest generation of Londoners in history\u201d, as he puts it in his book. Thanks to the Labour government\u2019s commitment to housebuilding, when he was five, his family was able to swap its tiny south London council flat, which had no bathroom, for one with hot water and a bedroom each for him and his sister. His dad, a former merchant seaman turned window cleaner, and his mum, a former music hall dancer, were Tories, but they were socially liberal and not, for the times, particularly strict and their son wonders now if this didn\u2019t have to do with the fact that they were more interested in each other than in their children. \u201cThey were passionately committed to each other and didn\u2019t plan to have kids. They met when Mum was dancing and Dad and his mates were hanging about at the stage door. They went for fish and chips afterwards and by the end of the evening, they knew it was the relationship of their life. The fourth time they met, it was their wedding.\u201d He sounds a little awestruck. Does he find this romantic? \u201cNo, I just wish it had happened to me.\u201d</p> <p>In his book, which is part memoir and part guide (there is a wholechapter devoted to restaurants, about which he used to write for the<em> Evening Standard</em>, and in which he reveals that his favourite chippy is the Nautilus in Fortune Green, and that it was the <em>Birds of a Feather</em> star Lesley Joseph who introduced him to pink champagne when they ate at the Ivy), Livingstone makes a lot of his hardscrabble beginnings: one pair of socks and one pair of pants used to have to last all week, or so he says.</p> <p>But it wasn\u2019t really his family\u2019s relative lack of wealth that influenced his politics (in any case, his parents went on to buy their own home in West Norwood). Nor was it his sense of being different, though different was undoubtedly how he felt. \u201cI almost died of gastroenteritis when I was two,\u201d he says. \u201cI was physically three years behind everyone else, the smallest, runtiest kid. I couldn\u2019t climb the bars in the gym; I used to come joint last with a fat boy in running races. I was weak and nerdy. I was the last kid in my year to get pubic hair.\u201d</p> <p>So what was it, then? What turned him leftwards? \u201cIt was just about doing things. That\u2019s why people went into politics then, on both sides: to get things done, not to be a bloody celebrity.\u201d John Major, he reminds me, was, just like himself, on Lambeth Council\u2019s housing committee as a young councillor: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to remember that Tory leaders then had fought side by side with working-class men in the war, whereas the political elite now haven\u2019t had any contact with working-class people. That\u2019s why they\u2019re so unrepresentative.\u201d</p> <p>His father worried about him, this boy who was obsessed with astronomy and amphibians and who never seemed to have a girlfriend (women, he says, found neither his face nor his \u201cboring voice\u201d attractive; he was 21 before he drunkenly lost his virginity). But it was a time of full employment and when he left school, like every boy in his class, he soon found a job, in his case, working as an animal technician at the Royal Marsden cancer research unit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"11fa1e5007e18b0fe059d7ff08e45a6aba3bc399\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11fa1e5007e18b0fe059d7ff08e45a6aba3bc399/0_0_3000_2007/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With his wife, Emma Beal,  after casting his vote in the London mayoral and local elections, May 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"669\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With his wife, Emma Beal, after casting his vote in the London mayoral and local elections, May 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rosie Hallam/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And then there was politics. Livingstone joined the Labour party in 1968 when everyone else seemed to be leaving it and as a result, in the 70s, he rose swiftly and smoothly through the ranks, first as a councillor and later on the Greater London Council, which he would eventually lead. He was always a controversial figure. His support for gay rights, he says, led to one report in the press suggesting he was importing pills from San Francisco that caused semen to be strawberry flavoured. But he has just as often been vindicated. The London congestion charge, which he brought in as mayor, has, for instance, been copied by other cities and towns and no future politician would ever think of rolling it back now.</p> <p>Does he miss running the city? \u201cYes, I loved it.\u201d Is there anything he wishes he had done differently? Seemingly unable to understand the question \u2013 though I rephrase it a couple of times \u2013 he launches into a list of his achievements, from enabling planning permission for the Shard, the capital\u2019s tallest building, to the revamping of the city\u2019s overground train services. Of course, the first time he stood to be mayor in 2000, it was as an independent against Labour\u2019s official candidate, Frank Dobson. Blair would rather have had just about anyone other than him in the job, including (according to Livingstone) Delia Smith. What does Livingstone think of Blair now? Has time softened the edges off their enmity? \u201cThe problem with Tony was that he was very talented and bright, but in his years at Oxford, he never went to any political event. He was into acting and music.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m going to get into environmental campaigning: there\u2019s a real possibility of extinction by the end of the century</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I laugh a bit at this, because to almost anyone else, this might be seen as a plus: a politician with a hinterland and thus, perhaps, a sense of perspective. But Livingstone continues smoothly on. \u201cHe had to join Labour or Cherie wouldn\u2019t have married him, so he comes into politics with no background or understanding and he reads all this crap about how I\u2019m a Soviet agent.\u201d Is Corbyn\u2019s Labour party too apt to forget the achievements of New Labour? \u201cWell, he will keep the policies on race and sexuality. But they didn\u2019t restructure the economy. That\u2019s the damning indictment.\u201d</p> <p>Livingstone has five children: teenagers with his wife, Emma Beal, whom he married in 2009, and three older children, two girls and a boy, whose existence only became public during the 2008 mayoral election campaign (in a memoir he published in 2011, he revealed, oh-so-casually, that he had agreed to help out their mothers, friends of his who both feared they might miss their chance to have children; at the time, he was still with Kate Allen, Amnesty International UK director and the partner with whom he spent 20 years before he met Beal). Are his children Corbynites? What do they make of their father\u2019s politics?</p> <p>\u201cMy children are not into politics,\u201d he says. \u201cThe three older ones are in their late 20s. They saw what I had to put up with and that\u2019s not going to encourage you. But they\u2019re all progressive: my older girls [Georgia and Lottie] work in the NHS; one is a midwife and one works in administration. Liam runs a website. Tom [his son with Beal] spends all day on the computer and Mia shops with her friends. She wants to be a marine biologist.\u201d Are they proud of their father? He replies by answering a question I haven\u2019t yet asked. \u201cWe all go out for meals together regularly and we get on well.\u201d Is it true that they all used to go on holiday together? \u201cYes, it is.\u201d You\u2019re the great paterfamilias, I say. \u201cWell, look how old I am with kids in their early teens. It\u2019s unusual. But they keep me young. That and walking the dog.\u201d</p> <p>Does he believe his political career is over now? \u201cTom and Mia are 15 and 16. They don\u2019t need me hanging around any more. So I\u2019m going to get much more involved in environmental campaigning, because I\u2019m pessimistic: I believe there\u2019s a real possibility of extinction by the end of the century.\u201d</p> <p>Are there still newts in the pond in his north London garden?</p> <p>\u201cThere are, but the tragedy is that 10 years ago in the springtime, there would be a dozen frogs laying spawn and now there are none. The population has collapsed and there are very few newts, too, comparatively. It used to be heaving with amphibians! We are destroying the planet. When I was a boy, we assumed we\u2019d go to Mars. But we know now that\u2019s too expensive and there\u2019s deadly radiation. We evolved to live on this planet \u2013 look how astronauts are when they spend six months at the space station. They can hardly walk. So we can\u2019t just spread out across the universe. That\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d</p> <p>Talking of newts and far-off planets, he looks, and sounds, highly animated. Nevertheless, in his heart ambition and perhaps even (whisper it) regret are, I think, still swirling around in such a way as to put a bit of a crimp on a man\u2019s retirement. \u201cIf the Labour party was to bring me back in, it would be all screaming about antisemitism,\u201d he says. \u201cBut Jeremy has the chance now to run the best government since 1945.\u201d So he would like a job? His gaze shifts beyond my shoulder. \u201cI would do\u2026 anything.\u201d</p> <h2>Book extract: Livingstone\u2019s London by Ken Livingstone</h2> <p>I had no option but to stand as an independent for mayor, and won a convincing majority on 4 May 2000.

You\u2019re now the leader of the equivalent of a small nation. Resolute, that\u2019s what you must be, resolute.\u201d This struck me as a bit odd, given just 15 years previously she was comparing me to a communist dictator, but the mood on the streets was amazing, with everyone shaking my hand and slapping me on the back. After the vote was analysed it turned out that I had got the support of 46% of Labour voters, 33% of Lib Dems and, bizarrely, 24% of Tories.</p> <p>As leader of the GLC I had been managing the 47 other Labour members, but the American mayoral system, which is used at City Hall, is completely different. You\u2019re the chief executive of the whole machine and every decision is made by you. Just 10 days after the election I was completely knackered and woke up one morning to find my leg swollen. My GP thought it was thrombosis and whisked me off to hospital. Fortunately it turned out to be a Baker\u2019s cyst caused by my spending too long on my knees gardening.</p> <p>One of the most important things was to clamp down on the way the bus companies were ripping London off. Back in my GLC days, tube and bus drivers earned the same, but after bus privatisation bus drivers\u2019 wages had been slashed to just \u00a316,000 a year, compared to the tube drivers on \u00a325,000. Having organised a wage increase for the bus drivers, I couldn\u2019t get on a bus without the driver congratulating me.</p> <p>A lot of people were amazed when I appointed to run Transport for London the American Bob Kiley, who had joined the CIA in 1963 and ended up as executive assistant to CIA director Richard Helms, who had been given a suspended prison sentence for lying to Congress and covering up assassinations. But Bob and I hit it off immediately and I was delighted to discover that he had spent a lot of his time driving Robert Kennedy to election rallies in his campaign to be president in 1968.</p> <p>Although everyone thought I wouldn\u2019t get on with the head of London\u2019s police, both Sir John Stevens and his deputy, Ian Blair, had a great working relationship with me. Towards the end of my first year in office, I was with Sir John at a police officers\u2019 annual dinner when he got word that there had been a fire in my office. Fearing this might be a deliberate attempt on my life, Sir John sent armed police to my home. Sitting in the car with Sir John, his protection officer asked me: \u201cCan you think of anybody who might have a grudge against you?\u201d I laughed and said: \u201cHow long have you got?\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Livingstone\u2019s London</em> is published by Muswell Press (\u00a38.99).

      "bodyText": "For the first time in his life, Ken Livingstone didn\u2019t vote Labour at the European elections last month. But don\u2019t panic: he didn\u2019t vote Liberal Democrat either. Not for him the (supposed) treachery of Alastair Campbell. In fact, he didn\u2019t vote at all. The former mayor of London was in Angola, making a speech to the World Tourism Forum, a trip that came up at the last moment, leaving him with no time to arrange a postal vote. Did the result, disastrous for both Labour and the Tories, shock him? (In west Africa for less than 24 hours, he was back in good time for the TV coverage.) No, not at all. It struck him as utterly predictable and he sees no cause for concern on the Labour side. \u201cI think there\u2019s a consensus now that Labour have got to campaign for the UK to remain in the EU,\u201d he insists, as if such a position was the most straightforward thing in the world. (It isn\u2019t, especially since the byelection in Peterborough, a constituency that voted strongly to leave, which Labour managed to win.) Livingstone\u2019s old comrade Jeremy Corbyn, whose fence-sitting in this matter barely serves to conceal his Leaver tendencies, will soon, he believes, have other things on his mind than the question of Europe. \u201cJeremy has always been a critic of the EU,\u201d he says, almost fondly (Livingstone voted Remain in the referendum, \u201cwithout any doubt\u201d in his mind at all). \u201cAnd half of Labour MPs are in seats that voted to leave, so they thought they\u2019d have to respect that. But I think that\u2019s all behind us now. There isn\u2019t a majority in parliament for leaving without a deal and the Tories are going to elect a leader who will go for a hard Brexit. So there must be a prospect of a general election soon.\u201d Labour will, he claims, win this election and thereafter it will swiftly become clear that Brexit was merely \u201ca brief diversion\u201d. Britain will stay in the EU and Corbyn and John McDonnell will then set about leading what he believes will be the best and most reforming Labour government since that of Clement Attlee in 1945. Crikey. As conversations go, this one has certainly kicked off at high speed. What makes it all the more dizzying \u2013 the idea that Brexit is just a \u201cbrief diversion\u201d strikes me as preposterous, if not a touch mad \u2013 is that it is so unexpected. For one thing, Livingstone is ostensibly here to talk about Livingstone\u2019s London: A Celebration of People and Places, a gentle little book full of historical statistics and stuff about blue plaques that he has written for a new publishing company set up by his wife\u2019s two sisters; before our meeting was fixed, we were told that he wasn\u2019t keen to talk about politics. For another, his words, punchy and far reaching, are somewhat at odds with his bearing. He\u2019s perfectly affable, a smile permanently spread across his face, but there\u2019s something rather frail and depleted about him, too: if he talks proudly of being a house-husband, behind the boast it\u2019s possible to detect a certain purposelessness and sense of loss. His wide, royal blue braces only add to this effect. They seem to belong to another man altogether. He and I meet in a private club in Soho (neither of us is a member) on the morning of Trump\u2019s visit \u2013 and yes, if he wasn\u2019t seeing me, he would be out there protesting alongside Corbyn. \u201cThis is the worst president of my lifetime,\u201d he says. \u201cA most irrational man and if things go wrong, we\u2019re going to have a bloody war.\u201d He travelled here on the tube and will return home the same way; he never learned to drive and no, he has never ridden a Boris bike, either. Outside, a pneumatic drill attacks another London street, but the terrible din seems to affect Livingstone far less than it does me. His answers to my questions are long and digressive, reaching ever further backwards into the past. I have the feeling that whatever lengths he might have gone to when he was mayor to protect his privacy, he rather likes doing interviews. \u201cPoliticians don\u2019t answer questions any more,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons why Farage has done so well. He says what he thinks. When I was campaigning against Boris [to be mayor], one of the things that always amazed me was that he always said what people wanted to hear, whatever the audience.\u201d At whose feet does he lay this trend for half-truths and empty platitudes? Apparently, for this as for so much else, we can blame New Labour: \u201cIt\u2019s the legacy of the Blair era. You tell people what they want to hear.\u201d Livingstone thinks those polls that suggest more people would now vote Remain than Leave are correct, but that this can be put down to the business community rather than politicians: \u201cThe worries of business have got across to people.\u201d If he was a Labour MP in a Leave constituency, he wouldn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cPeople were lied to. If I was an MP, I would be campaigning to say: this was a mistake. We must remain or you will lose your jobs. I suppose they worry that the party will be decimated if they do, but I can\u2019t see the point unless you say what you believe. Only eccentrics like Kate Hoey [the MP for Vauxhall] and John Mann [the MP for Bassetlaw] voted Leave. Everyone else knew how bad it would be for the economy.\u201d Has he said any of this to Corbyn and McDonnell? \u201cThey don\u2019t need my advice. But if they asked, I would tell them.\u201d His greatest regret \u2013 the only regret he is willing to admit to me \u2013 is that he didn\u2019t return to parliament after losing to Boris Johnson for the second time in 2012 (Livingstone was the MP for Brent East from 1987 to 2001) and so won\u2019t be available to join their cabinet. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have ever disagreed about economic issues,\u201d he says. \u201cAs I say, Labour is going to come out in favour of Remain, whether by means of an election or a second referendum. The real issue isn\u2019t the EU. The real issue is that Cameron and May make Thatcher look like a progressive liberal. They have made cuts she would never had dared to. Would she have cut 22,000 police? No, it\u2019s inconceivable.\u201d The way forward is, he thinks, perfectly obvious. \u201cWe do not need to increase taxes on ordinary people to rebuild our state. We just need to stop the super-rich and the corporations that pay no bloody tax. If we make them pay their share, we\u2019ll have all the money we need.\u201d But there may be other reasons why no one asks his advice just lately. Livingstone is not currently a member of the Labour party, having resigned his membership last year because he did not wish to be a \u201cdistraction\u201d following allegations of antisemitism made against him (until then, he had been fighting disciplinary action that followed after he told the BBC in 2016 that in 1932 Hitler had championed Jewish emigration to Israel and was \u201csupporting Zionism before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews\u201d). Does he feel sad about this? \u201cOf course. But the trouble is that when Jeremy became leader the disciplinary unit was stuffed with Blairites, who hate lefties like me. They dragged it out for two years and were clearly planning to drag it out for more. I was just being used to undermine Jeremy.\u201d Hmm. I\u2019m not sure I buy this argument, if only because the party expelled Alastair Campbell so quickly \u2013 and simply for having admitted, after the election, that he had not voted Labour (it took them about two seconds). But he\u2019s not to be put off. \u201cThe rules are clear. You can\u2019t support other parties and stay in the Labour party.\u201d Why, then, has no one disciplined his old friend Kate Hoey, who likes to be photographed cosying up to Nigel Farage? He laughs. \u201cI know. When she was a Marxist, I completely agreed with her. But she has bizarre views now.\u201d Still, he\u2019s hopeful that the issue of antisemitism in the party will soon be resolved. To my amazement, he is utterly \u201cdelighted\u201d that the Equalities and Human Rights Commission is formally to investigate whether Labour has unlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimised people because they are Jewish, an inquiry announced last month after it received a number of complaints of antisemitism in the party. \u201cIt\u2019s brilliant,\u201d he says, banging the table so that his coffee cup rattles. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to do a fair investigation, they\u2019re going to find that about 250 members have been found to have tweeted something antisemitic, that about 100 are still under investigation, and that this is about 0.08% of our members.\u201d Even better, the investigation will give him the chance to clear his name, to prove once and for all that journalists have wilfully misquoted him and that he never said Hitler was a Zionist (he did, however, unquestionably say that Hitler supported Zionism). \u201cI\u2019m writing to them. I assume they will want to question me.\u201d What follows, in this part of our conversation, is dispiriting, to put it mildly (and from a man, too, who will later tell me that he has just finished reading Simon Schama\u2019s \u201cquite remarkable\u201d The Story of the Jews). When I ask him about the experiences of Luciana Berger, the Jewish former Labour MP who required police protection during last year\u2019s Labour party conference, he says only that the abuse she gets \u201con the internet\u201d comes not from party members, but \u201cfrom bigots\u201d (she would doubtless disagree, given the behaviour of some members of her local party). When I ask if he doesn\u2019t see the point made by Margaret Hodge, another Jewish Labour MP, when she notes that the mere fact of the EHRC investigation brings shame on the party, he will respond only off the record. When I ask if some Labour activists don\u2019t wilfully and perniciously conflate Judaism and Zionism, he talks for some while about Ben Gurion, Benjamin Netanyahu and a book called The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine, after which he insists that he wouldn\u2019t know what people say online \u201cbecause I\u2019ve never been on the internet in my life\u201d. In more than 50 years in the Labour party, he never saw or heard anything antisemitic. \u201cIf you\u2019re antisemitic, you\u2019re not going to join the Labour party, are you?\u201d And why\u2019s that? \u201cBecause the most prominent Jewish MPs are Labour MPs.\u201d The allegations against both himself and the Labour party are not upsetting to him, first because he has had \u201c38 years of lies and smears\u201d and, second, because he knows they\u2019re the invention of the media. \u201cYou plough through these stories and there\u2019s almost no examples [of antisemitic abuse].\u201d Livingstone was born in 1945, into a world in which things seemed always to be getting better: \u201cthe luckiest generation of Londoners in history\u201d, as he puts it in his book. Thanks to the Labour government\u2019s commitment to housebuilding, when he was five, his family was able to swap its tiny south London council flat, which had no bathroom, for one with hot water and a bedroom each for him and his sister. His dad, a former merchant seaman turned window cleaner, and his mum, a former music hall dancer, were Tories, but they were socially liberal and not, for the times, particularly strict and their son wonders now if this didn\u2019t have to do with the fact that they were more interested in each other than in their children. \u201cThey were passionately committed to each other and didn\u2019t plan to have kids. They met when Mum was dancing and Dad and his mates were hanging about at the stage door. They went for fish and chips afterwards and by the end of the evening, they knew it was the relationship of their life. The fourth time they met, it was their wedding.\u201d He sounds a little awestruck. Does he find this romantic? \u201cNo, I just wish it had happened to me.\u201d In his book, which is part memoir and part guide (there is a wholechapter devoted to restaurants, about which he used to write for the Evening Standard, and in which he reveals that his favourite chippy is the Nautilus in Fortune Green, and that it was the Birds of a Feather star Lesley Joseph who introduced him to pink champagne when they ate at the Ivy), Livingstone makes a lot of his hardscrabble beginnings: one pair of socks and one pair of pants used to have to last all week, or so he says. But it wasn\u2019t really his family\u2019s relative lack of wealth that influenced his politics (in any case, his parents went on to buy their own home in West Norwood). Nor was it his sense of being different, though different was undoubtedly how he felt. \u201cI almost died of gastroenteritis when I was two,\u201d he says. \u201cI was physically three years behind everyone else, the smallest, runtiest kid. I couldn\u2019t climb the bars in the gym; I used to come joint last with a fat boy in running races. I was weak and nerdy. I was the last kid in my year to get pubic hair.\u201d So what was it, then? What turned him leftwards? \u201cIt was just about doing things. That\u2019s why people went into politics then, on both sides: to get things done, not to be a bloody celebrity.\u201d John Major, he reminds me, was, just like himself, on Lambeth Council\u2019s housing committee as a young councillor: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to remember that Tory leaders then had fought side by side with working-class men in the war, whereas the political elite now haven\u2019t had any contact with working-class people. That\u2019s why they\u2019re so unrepresentative.\u201d His father worried about him, this boy who was obsessed with astronomy and amphibians and who never seemed to have a girlfriend (women, he says, found neither his face nor his \u201cboring voice\u201d attractive; he was 21 before he drunkenly lost his virginity). But it was a time of full employment and when he left school, like every boy in his class, he soon found a job, in his case, working as an animal technician at the Royal Marsden cancer research unit. And then there was politics. Livingstone joined the Labour party in 1968 when everyone else seemed to be leaving it and as a result, in the 70s, he rose swiftly and smoothly through the ranks, first as a councillor and later on the Greater London Council, which he would eventually lead. He was always a controversial figure. His support for gay rights, he says, led to one report in the press suggesting he was importing pills from San Francisco that caused semen to be strawberry flavoured. But he has just as often been vindicated. The London congestion charge, which he brought in as mayor, has, for instance, been copied by other cities and towns and no future politician would ever think of rolling it back now. Does he miss running the city? \u201cYes, I loved it.\u201d Is there anything he wishes he had done differently? Seemingly unable to understand the question \u2013 though I rephrase it a couple of times \u2013 he launches into a list of his achievements, from enabling planning permission for the Shard, the capital\u2019s tallest building, to the revamping of the city\u2019s overground train services. Of course, the first time he stood to be mayor in 2000, it was as an independent against Labour\u2019s official candidate, Frank Dobson. Blair would rather have had just about anyone other than him in the job, including (according to Livingstone) Delia Smith. What does Livingstone think of Blair now? Has time softened the edges off their enmity? \u201cThe problem with Tony was that he was very talented and bright, but in his years at Oxford, he never went to any political event. He was into acting and music.\u201d I laugh a bit at this, because to almost anyone else, this might be seen as a plus: a politician with a hinterland and thus, perhaps, a sense of perspective. But Livingstone continues smoothly on. \u201cHe had to join Labour or Cherie wouldn\u2019t have married him, so he comes into politics with no background or understanding and he reads all this crap about how I\u2019m a Soviet agent.\u201d Is Corbyn\u2019s Labour party too apt to forget the achievements of New Labour? \u201cWell, he will keep the policies on race and sexuality. But they didn\u2019t restructure the economy. That\u2019s the damning indictment.\u201d Livingstone has five children: teenagers with his wife, Emma Beal, whom he married in 2009, and three older children, two girls and a boy, whose existence only became public during the 2008 mayoral election campaign (in a memoir he published in 2011, he revealed, oh-so-casually, that he had agreed to help out their mothers, friends of his who both feared they might miss their chance to have children; at the time, he was still with Kate Allen, Amnesty International UK director and the partner with whom he spent 20 years before he met Beal). Are his children Corbynites? What do they make of their father\u2019s politics? \u201cMy children are not into politics,\u201d he says. \u201cThe three older ones are in their late 20s. They saw what I had to put up with and that\u2019s not going to encourage you. But they\u2019re all progressive: my older girls [Georgia and Lottie] work in the NHS; one is a midwife and one works in administration. Liam runs a website. Tom [his son with Beal] spends all day on the computer and Mia shops with her friends. She wants to be a marine biologist.\u201d Are they proud of their father? He replies by answering a question I haven\u2019t yet asked. \u201cWe all go out for meals together regularly and we get on well.\u201d Is it true that they all used to go on holiday together? \u201cYes, it is.\u201d You\u2019re the great paterfamilias, I say. \u201cWell, look how old I am with kids in their early teens. It\u2019s unusual. But they keep me young. That and walking the dog.\u201d Does he believe his political career is over now? \u201cTom and Mia are 15 and 16. They don\u2019t need me hanging around any more. So I\u2019m going to get much more involved in environmental campaigning, because I\u2019m pessimistic: I believe there\u2019s a real possibility of extinction by the end of the century.\u201d Are there still newts in the pond in his north London garden? \u201cThere are, but the tragedy is that 10 years ago in the springtime, there would be a dozen frogs laying spawn and now there are none. The population has collapsed and there are very few newts, too, comparatively. It used to be heaving with amphibians! We are destroying the planet. When I was a boy, we assumed we\u2019d go to Mars. But we know now that\u2019s too expensive and there\u2019s deadly radiation. We evolved to live on this planet \u2013 look how astronauts are when they spend six months at the space station. They can hardly walk. So we can\u2019t just spread out across the universe. That\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d Talking of newts and far-off planets, he looks, and sounds, highly animated. Nevertheless, in his heart ambition and perhaps even (whisper it) regret are, I think, still swirling around in such a way as to put a bit of a crimp on a man\u2019s retirement. \u201cIf the Labour party was to bring me back in, it would be all screaming about antisemitism,\u201d he says. \u201cBut Jeremy has the chance now to run the best government since 1945.\u201d So he would like a job? His gaze shifts beyond my shoulder. \u201cI would do\u2026 anything.\u201d Book extract: Livingstone\u2019s London by Ken Livingstone I had no option but to stand as an independent for mayor, and won a convincing majority on 4 May 2000. The first words I said after the result was announced were: \u201cAs I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted 14 years ago.\u201d The Daily Mail warned: \u201cLeftwing extremist Ken Livingstone seizes control.\u201d The Daily Telegraph said: \u201cLivingstone represents the Beckhamisation of politics.\u201d The Independent on Sunday warned \u201cKen has his eyes on No 10\u201d and the Sunday Telegraph said I was not up to the job. The Times claimed: \u201cPutin is said to be an admirer.\u201d Oddly enough, Margaret Thatcher came up to me at an event and said: \u201cStick to your guns: everyone will be trying to tell you to do something else, but you must keep your resolve. You\u2019re now the leader of the equivalent of a small nation. Resolute, that\u2019s what you must be, resolute.\u201d This struck me as a bit odd, given just 15 years previously she was comparing me to a communist dictator, but the mood on the streets was amazing, with everyone shaking my hand and slapping me on the back. After the vote was analysed it turned out that I had got the support of 46% of Labour voters, 33% of Lib Dems and, bizarrely, 24% of Tories. As leader of the GLC I had been managing the 47 other Labour members, but the American mayoral system, which is used at City Hall, is completely different. You\u2019re the chief executive of the whole machine and every decision is made by you. Just 10 days after the election I was completely knackered and woke up one morning to find my leg swollen. My GP thought it was thrombosis and whisked me off to hospital. Fortunately it turned out to be a Baker\u2019s cyst caused by my spending too long on my knees gardening. One of the most important things was to clamp down on the way the bus companies were ripping London off. Back in my GLC days, tube and bus drivers earned the same, but after bus privatisation bus drivers\u2019 wages had been slashed to just \u00a316,000 a year, compared to the tube drivers on \u00a325,000. Having organised a wage increase for the bus drivers, I couldn\u2019t get on a bus without the driver congratulating me. A lot of people were amazed when I appointed to run Transport for London the American Bob Kiley, who had joined the CIA in 1963 and ended up as executive assistant to CIA director Richard Helms, who had been given a suspended prison sentence for lying to Congress and covering up assassinations. But Bob and I hit it off immediately and I was delighted to discover that he had spent a lot of his time driving Robert Kennedy to election rallies in his campaign to be president in 1968. Although everyone thought I wouldn\u2019t get on with the head of London\u2019s police, both Sir John Stevens and his deputy, Ian Blair, had a great working relationship with me. Towards the end of my first year in office, I was with Sir John at a police officers\u2019 annual dinner when he got word that there had been a fire in my office.

The quote marks are her own. \u201c\u2018Healing crystals\u2019 are mined in places like Myanmar and the Democratic Republic of Congo where mineral extraction is linked to severe human-rights violations and environmental harm.\u201d In the DRC, seven-year-old children work in the cobalt and copper mines, where covetable \u201chealing\u201d stones such as citrine and smoky quartz abound. International NGO <a href=\"https://www.globalwitness.org/en/\" title=\"\">Global Witness</a> found that the Taliban earns up to $20m a year from Afghanistan\u2019s lapis mines, lapis lazuli being, as crystal websites explain, one of the best stones for activating psychic abilities. \u201cAs with most minerals,\u201d adds Sampat, \u201cit is impossible to know for sure if your crystal was obtained via an environmental and human rights horror show.\u201d</p> <p>Crystals are found on every continent, but it\u2019s difficult to find a crystal seller who will specify the origins of individual stones and even harder to find one willing to talk honestly about the effects of mining. There\u2019s no governing body requiring they do so, no regulator for an industry mired in exploitation and secrecy. Stephen Wells at <a href=\"https://www.kacha-stones.com/\" title=\"\">Kacha Stones</a> is one of a handful of sellers who prides himself on his ethical practices. He emails from India where he\u2019s sourcing moonstone, tourmaline and kyanite despite their rarity and his infected root canal. \u201cIf something is cheap and available in huge quantities,\u201d he writes, \u201cthe odds are it\u2019s the result of a huge commercial enterprise, often the by-product of mining entirely unrelated to crystals.\u201d</p> <p>For Wells, the importance of ethical crystal mining is not solely about the impact on the planet, but also on the crystal itself \u2013 he believes the mining of a stone affects its healing properties. \u201cTaking something by force, destructively, has an effect on any living thing. Crystals are archetypal pure frequencies, nature\u2019s perfect geometric tuning forks. Can anyone imagine the shockwaves of explosions having no impact?\u201d At home, using a garden fork and trowel, he digs for Welsh quartz. \u201cI don\u2019t dig indiscriminately. I fill in the small holes I make and try not to exploit myself in the process. That\u2019s as eco-friendly as mining gets, but it isn\u2019t going to make much of an impact on global trade.\u201d The more we talk, the more surprising it seems that crystal consumers, the kind of people who wouldn\u2019t eat a battery-farmed egg, let alone meat they couldn\u2019t trace, are yet to question the provenance of their crystals.</p> <p><em><strong>An industrial park </strong></em>in Watford, and rain beats down on the plastic roof of the warehouse where <a href=\"https://www.thecrystalgeode.co.uk/\" title=\"\">the Crystal Geode</a>, a wholesale crystal supplier, stores its salt lamps, amethysts and complicated fairy ephemera. Neil Ashcroft, director of the family business, explains first the expansion of the company, and then the expansion of his mind. In 1986, when he was in his late 20s and working for the police, Ashcroft was in a motorbike accident that hospitalised him for two years. It technically killed him three times and lost him his left leg. He had \u201cout-of-body experiences\u201d; when he finally returned home, he was different. An ex introduced him to crystals, which helped him feel more \u201cgrounded\u201d. He never planned to make much money from selling them and still, today, spends much of his time advising customers on, \u201csay, which stones are best for anxiety, or which are best for blood disorders.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4243fe111924c84877fe3f123863a70c9834d4f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4243fe111924c84877fe3f123863a70c9834d4f6/8_0_1761_2200/800.jpg\" alt=\"Hard labour: a worker grades amethysts by colour in Uruguay.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hard labour: a worker grades amethysts by colour in Uruguay.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andres Stapff/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But as celebrities began broadcasting their interest, says Ashcroft, he saw the industry explode. While sales are up, the pressure to undercut prices online is rising too, which makes it harder for Ashcroft to maintain his insistence on high-quality crystals, ethically mined. And while he attempts to work only with suppliers he trusts, he\u2019s clear there\u2019s much he\u2019ll never know: crystals are rarely the primary product that miners are looking for, but rather the shiny byproducts found alongside more valuable elements used in our phones and TVs \u2013 so mining supply chains are complicated and often shrouded in mystery.</p> <p>Ashcroft releases a defeated sigh: \u201cAll I can do is ensure that at least quality and genuine crystals are coming into the market. We\u2019re buying from the best possible sources. But sometimes unethical mines are the only sources of the crystals people want. I try to stay as aware of their origins as possible, but I can be concerned about it while also feeling\u2026 impotent?\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cMost retailers feel they want to [be ethical], but can\u2019t implement it.\u201d As we descend from the office into aisles lined with cardboard boxes containing carved angels and jade tumble stones, he tries to elaborate \u2013 the market is so huge, the demand is so high, the internet is so vast\u2026 But his words tail off.</p> <p>The truth is, many retailers have no idea where their crystals come from. Many, like tourmaline, amethyst, quartz and citrine (used to \u201cmanifest abundance and prosperity\u201d) are found in gold, copper or cobalt mines, but even publicly traded industrial mines aren\u2019t required to disclose profits from byproducts. And rather than directly from mines, or even the factories where the stones are cut and polished, retailers like the Crystal Geode buy from go-betweens, independent traders who sell at touring shows, who, even if they have documentation to prove their supply chain, are disinclined to share it, in part for fear of doing themselves out of a job.</p> <p><em><strong>The experience of</strong></em> taking a train into the suburbs, then driving through an industrial park, then picking through the boxes of a crystal retailer felt like an odd reflection of the experience of trying to understand the dark origins of crystals themselves: a step-by-step sloughing off of glamour, of magic. Their story is not dissimilar to that of cocaine, a drug that wealthy westerners buy because it makes them feel fun and interesting, choosing to ignore the fact people have almost definitely been tortured and beheaded earlier in its supply chain in order to provide their weekend buzz. Consumers buy a product they benefit from, whether through the brief bitter high of cocaine, or the compliments garnered from a \u00a35 party dress, or the feeling of inner peace from wearing a crystal, and therefore, doesn\u2019t it make sense that we share in the moral culpability for the unethical practices that brought it to us?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"066b171c149f65b684027796ec91d1e8ac9bdbee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/066b171c149f65b684027796ec91d1e8ac9bdbee/0_366_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Window shopping: a display of healing crystals in a British shop.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Window shopping: a display of healing crystals in a British shop.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David J Green/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Notting Hill, it\u2019s easier to forget.<em><strong> </strong></em>The <em>Financial Times</em>\u2019s \u201cHow To Spend It\u201d profile of the owners of <a href=\"https://venusrox.com/\" title=\"\">Venusrox</a> begins with a vision of wealthy wellness: \u201cMatt and Victoria Forster are smooth-skinned, clear-eyed and radiate a happiness and harmony that most of us could spend a lifetime failing to achieve. Ask them their secret and they answer in unison: \u2018Passion for crystals.\u2019\u201d One bright morning (after they twice turned down interview requests), I visited their showroom, a gallery of stones all of which are labelled with the country they\u2019ve come from, and some also labelled with the mines. There were small smooth stones (including lapis lazuli from Afghanistan and shattuckite from the DRC) for a few pounds, and large glittering rocks the size of a newborn baby for tens of thousands. It was here that the secondary ethical dilemma of the crystal industry became immediately apparent. It\u2019s one thing to market a crystal for its decorative purposes, but another with the promise it will, like amethyst, \u201chelp overcome addictions\u201d.</p> <p>The appeal of crystals is two-tiered. Their infinite sparkliness has an obvious draw, but their value relies on a belief in their healing powers. Emma Lucy Knowles, author of <em>The Power of Crystal Healing</em> (her celebrity clients include Victoria Beckham) explains it to me like this: \u201cWe work with crystals to draw out the \u2018negative\u2019 and \u2018heighten\u2019 the positive, such as love, protection, abundance or seeking to detoxify from fear, guilt, worry. They can be used to filter that property into the energy centres, the chakras.\u201d She recommends placing quartz by photos of people you love, \u201cto promote that vibration in their direction\u201d. \u201cCrystals are formed under pressure, much like ourselves. The power of life force \u2013 what\u2019s not to love about that?\u201d It\u2019s a hypothetical question.</p> <p>Standing among the quartz and citrine in Notting Hill, I breathe deeply, and consider my flow. In 2001 Dr Christopher French, a psychologist at Goldsmith, set out to test the effects of crystals on 80 volunteers. Half were given a piece of quartz to meditate with, while the rest were given a piece of similar-looking plastic and told it was a crystal. They were also given a booklet explaining 10 of the sensations they might experience, which included tingling, more focused attention, improved sense of wellbeing, a rise in hand temperature and \u201cactivation of all levels of consciousness\u201d. Out of the 80, only six failed to experience at least one of these sensations. \u201cThe fact that the same effects were found with both genuine and fake crystals undermines any claims that crystals have the mysterious powers which they are claimed to have,\u201d said French. Dr Richard Wiseman, a psychologist at the University of Hertfordshire in Hatfield, added: \u201cThe power of crystals is in the mind instead of in the crystals. Clearly there is an effect, but people are paying hundreds of pounds for crystals and they might as well pay just a couple of quid.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"459f86d81ec2cf7791072b42ef9a8e4296a5049c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/459f86d81ec2cf7791072b42ef9a8e4296a5049c/0_1152_4084_2450/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On the rocks: a young woman at a crystal healing session.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On the rocks: a young woman at a crystal healing session.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But who really wants to hear this? Who wants to pull back the wizard\u2019s curtain? Neil Ashcroft of the Crystal Geode is clear that crystals have helped him: \u201cThey work \u2013 whether it\u2019s a placebo effect or not, they worked for me.\u201d For most of his customers a belief in the healing power of crystals, rather than the power of placebos, is a kind of faith. An understandable choice, it could be argued, in a time when people report feeling ever more critical of experts and \u201cfacts\u201d, keen for a release from technology, disconnected from traditional systems of care and desperate for something shiny that might save them. While it might be possible to debate the efficacy of healing crystals, it is harder to argue the often murky ethics of the process that delivers them.</p> <p>As the crystal market continues to grow, so does the need for an international reckoning. In 2000 campaigning from organisations such as Global Witness resulted in a United Nations resolution, and the establishment of the <a href=\"https://www.kimberleyprocess.com/en/about\" title=\"\">Kimberley Process</a> in 2002 virtually eliminated \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d. It\u2019s possible that the government could bring in similar regulations for crystals, but it\u2019s currently unlikely \u2013 despite the celebrity-led boom, the healing crystal industry is still nowhere near as profitable or powerful as the diamond industry. A crystal revolution would rely on a tipping of emotion. A consumer push.</p> <p>\u201cIt would be a great shame,\u201d says Sophia Pickles, the campaign leader at Global Witness, \u201cif consumers buying goods that they believe help them \u2018connect with the Earth\u2019 are, in fact, making purchases that are connected to grave human-rights abuses, environmental destruction, conflict and corruption. Unfortunately, this is a very real risk for products like crystals.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9b330e8dda1df4a415f5624e1b3c331f2c712cb6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b330e8dda1df4a415f5624e1b3c331f2c712cb6/124_13_766_957/400.jpg\" alt=\"Gwyneth likes them: the Goop Medicine Bag, including quartz, jasper, carnelian and citrine.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gwyneth likes them: the Goop Medicine Bag, including quartz, jasper, carnelian and citrine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Goop Shop</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Until retailers are required to prove responsible sourcing and reveal their supply chains, she says, crystal consumers must acknowledge they\u2019re participating in practices that are having devastating environmental and social impact. \u201cThe responsibility of companies to address harms to people and planet in their supply chains is gaining increasing traction. Industries selling \u2018wellbeing\u2019 that do not make it their business to take steps to ensure they are sourcing their materials responsibly are at risk of accusations of deep hypocrisy.\u201d</p> <p>A slow change is rumbling. A petition demanding Paltrow\u2019s <a href=\"https://goop.com/uk\" title=\"\">Goop</a> sell only ethically sourced crystals runs at almost 17,000 names, under the line, \u201cNo amount of sage can get rid of the bad vibes that come from human exploitation and environmental destruction.\u201d The growing number of people who use crystals, whether to \u201cdetoxify\u201d, reduce anxiety, or decorate iPhones must acknowledge their healing crystals are likely to have contributed to human trauma or environmental destruction.</p> <p>If more people knew this, wouldn\u2019t they begin rocking the boat? Campaigning as we have with food and fashion, people could start asking questions, demanding transparency about a crystal\u2019s origins, about the conditions of the mine, and the route it took to arrive in their warming hand. Because the power of a healing crystal is nothing compared with the power of a hundred thousand crystal buyers closing their purses. And now they know.</p> <p><em>Email Eva at <a href=\"mailto:e.wiseman@observer.co.uk\">e.wiseman@observer.co.uk</a> or follow her on Twitter<a href=\"http:\">@EvaWiseman</a></em></p>",

There\u2019s no governing body requiring they do so, no regulator for an industry mired in exploitation and secrecy. Stephen Wells at Kacha Stones is one of a handful of sellers who prides himself on his ethical practices. He emails from India where he\u2019s sourcing moonstone, tourmaline and kyanite despite their rarity and his infected root canal. \u201cIf something is cheap and available in huge quantities,\u201d he writes, \u201cthe odds are it\u2019s the result of a huge commercial enterprise, often the by-product of mining entirely unrelated to crystals.\u201d For Wells, the importance of ethical crystal mining is not solely about the impact on the planet, but also on the crystal itself \u2013 he believes the mining of a stone affects its healing properties. \u201cTaking something by force, destructively, has an effect on any living thing. Crystals are archetypal pure frequencies, nature\u2019s perfect geometric tuning forks. Can anyone imagine the shockwaves of explosions having no impact?\u201d At home, using a garden fork and trowel, he digs for Welsh quartz. \u201cI don\u2019t dig indiscriminately. I fill in the small holes I make and try not to exploit myself in the process. That\u2019s as eco-friendly as mining gets, but it isn\u2019t going to make much of an impact on global trade.\u201d The more we talk, the more surprising it seems that crystal consumers, the kind of people who wouldn\u2019t eat a battery-farmed egg, let alone meat they couldn\u2019t trace, are yet to question the provenance of their crystals. An industrial park in Watford, and rain beats down on the plastic roof of the warehouse where the Crystal Geode, a wholesale crystal supplier, stores its salt lamps, amethysts and complicated fairy ephemera. Neil Ashcroft, director of the family business, explains first the expansion of the company, and then the expansion of his mind. In 1986, when he was in his late 20s and working for the police, Ashcroft was in a motorbike accident that hospitalised him for two years. It technically killed him three times and lost him his left leg. He had \u201cout-of-body experiences\u201d; when he finally returned home, he was different. An ex introduced him to crystals, which helped him feel more \u201cgrounded\u201d. He never planned to make much money from selling them and still, today, spends much of his time advising customers on, \u201csay, which stones are best for anxiety, or which are best for blood disorders.\u201d But as celebrities began broadcasting their interest, says Ashcroft, he saw the industry explode. While sales are up, the pressure to undercut prices online is rising too, which makes it harder for Ashcroft to maintain his insistence on high-quality crystals, ethically mined. And while he attempts to work only with suppliers he trusts, he\u2019s clear there\u2019s much he\u2019ll never know: crystals are rarely the primary product that miners are looking for, but rather the shiny byproducts found alongside more valuable elements used in our phones and TVs \u2013 so mining supply chains are complicated and often shrouded in mystery. Ashcroft releases a defeated sigh: \u201cAll I can do is ensure that at least quality and genuine crystals are coming into the market. We\u2019re buying from the best possible sources. But sometimes unethical mines are the only sources of the crystals people want. I try to stay as aware of their origins as possible, but I can be concerned about it while also feeling\u2026 impotent?\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cMost retailers feel they want to [be ethical], but can\u2019t implement it.\u201d As we descend from the office into aisles lined with cardboard boxes containing carved angels and jade tumble stones, he tries to elaborate \u2013 the market is so huge, the demand is so high, the internet is so vast\u2026 But his words tail off. The truth is, many retailers have no idea where their crystals come from. Many, like tourmaline, amethyst, quartz and citrine (used to \u201cmanifest abundance and prosperity\u201d) are found in gold, copper or cobalt mines, but even publicly traded industrial mines aren\u2019t required to disclose profits from byproducts. And rather than directly from mines, or even the factories where the stones are cut and polished, retailers like the Crystal Geode buy from go-betweens, independent traders who sell at touring shows, who, even if they have documentation to prove their supply chain, are disinclined to share it, in part for fear of doing themselves out of a job. The experience of taking a train into the suburbs, then driving through an industrial park, then picking through the boxes of a crystal retailer felt like an odd reflection of the experience of trying to understand the dark origins of crystals themselves: a step-by-step sloughing off of glamour, of magic. Their story is not dissimilar to that of cocaine, a drug that wealthy westerners buy because it makes them feel fun and interesting, choosing to ignore the fact people have almost definitely been tortured and beheaded earlier in its supply chain in order to provide their weekend buzz. Consumers buy a product they benefit from, whether through the brief bitter high of cocaine, or the compliments garnered from a \u00a35 party dress, or the feeling of inner peace from wearing a crystal, and therefore, doesn\u2019t it make sense that we share in the moral culpability for the unethical practices that brought it to us? In Notting Hill, it\u2019s easier to forget. The Financial Times\u2019s \u201cHow To Spend It\u201d profile of the owners of Venusrox begins with a vision of wealthy wellness: \u201cMatt and Victoria Forster are smooth-skinned, clear-eyed and radiate a happiness and harmony that most of us could spend a lifetime failing to achieve. Ask them their secret and they answer in unison: \u2018Passion for crystals.\u2019\u201d One bright morning (after they twice turned down interview requests), I visited their showroom, a gallery of stones all of which are labelled with the country they\u2019ve come from, and some also labelled with the mines. There were small smooth stones (including lapis lazuli from Afghanistan and shattuckite from the DRC) for a few pounds, and large glittering rocks the size of a newborn baby for tens of thousands. It was here that the secondary ethical dilemma of the crystal industry became immediately apparent. It\u2019s one thing to market a crystal for its decorative purposes, but another with the promise it will, like amethyst, \u201chelp overcome addictions\u201d. The appeal of crystals is two-tiered. Their infinite sparkliness has an obvious draw, but their value relies on a belief in their healing powers. Emma Lucy Knowles, author of The Power of Crystal Healing (her celebrity clients include Victoria Beckham) explains it to me like this: \u201cWe work with crystals to draw out the \u2018negative\u2019 and \u2018heighten\u2019 the positive, such as love, protection, abundance or seeking to detoxify from fear, guilt, worry. They can be used to filter that property into the energy centres, the chakras.\u201d She recommends placing quartz by photos of people you love, \u201cto promote that vibration in their direction\u201d. \u201cCrystals are formed under pressure, much like ourselves. The power of life force \u2013 what\u2019s not to love about that?\u201d It\u2019s a hypothetical question. Standing among the quartz and citrine in Notting Hill, I breathe deeply, and consider my flow. In 2001 Dr Christopher French, a psychologist at Goldsmith, set out to test the effects of crystals on 80 volunteers. Half were given a piece of quartz to meditate with, while the rest were given a piece of similar-looking plastic and told it was a crystal. They were also given a booklet explaining 10 of the sensations they might experience, which included tingling, more focused attention, improved sense of wellbeing, a rise in hand temperature and \u201cactivation of all levels of consciousness\u201d. Out of the 80, only six failed to experience at least one of these sensations. \u201cThe fact that the same effects were found with both genuine and fake crystals undermines any claims that crystals have the mysterious powers which they are claimed to have,\u201d said French. Dr Richard Wiseman, a psychologist at the University of Hertfordshire in Hatfield, added: \u201cThe power of crystals is in the mind instead of in the crystals. Clearly there is an effect, but people are paying hundreds of pounds for crystals and they might as well pay just a couple of quid.\u201d But who really wants to hear this? Who wants to pull back the wizard\u2019s curtain? Neil Ashcroft of the Crystal Geode is clear that crystals have helped him: \u201cThey work \u2013 whether it\u2019s a placebo effect or not, they worked for me.\u201d For most of his customers a belief in the healing power of crystals, rather than the power of placebos, is a kind of faith. An understandable choice, it could be argued, in a time when people report feeling ever more critical of experts and \u201cfacts\u201d, keen for a release from technology, disconnected from traditional systems of care and desperate for something shiny that might save them. While it might be possible to debate the efficacy of healing crystals, it is harder to argue the often murky ethics of the process that delivers them. As the crystal market continues to grow, so does the need for an international reckoning. In 2000 campaigning from organisations such as Global Witness resulted in a United Nations resolution, and the establishment of the Kimberley Process in 2002 virtually eliminated \u201cconflict diamonds\u201d. It\u2019s possible that the government could bring in similar regulations for crystals, but it\u2019s currently unlikely \u2013 despite the celebrity-led boom, the healing crystal industry is still nowhere near as profitable or powerful as the diamond industry. A crystal revolution would rely on a tipping of emotion. A consumer push. \u201cIt would be a great shame,\u201d says Sophia Pickles, the campaign leader at Global Witness, \u201cif consumers buying goods that they believe help them \u2018connect with the Earth\u2019 are, in fact, making purchases that are connected to grave human-rights abuses, environmental destruction, conflict and corruption. Unfortunately, this is a very real risk for products like crystals.\u201d Until retailers are required to prove responsible sourcing and reveal their supply chains, she says, crystal consumers must acknowledge they\u2019re participating in practices that are having devastating environmental and social impact. \u201cThe responsibility of companies to address harms to people and planet in their supply chains is gaining increasing traction. Industries selling \u2018wellbeing\u2019 that do not make it their business to take steps to ensure they are sourcing their materials responsibly are at risk of accusations of deep hypocrisy.\u201d A slow change is rumbling. A petition demanding Paltrow\u2019s Goop sell only ethically sourced crystals runs at almost 17,000 names, under the line, \u201cNo amount of sage can get rid of the bad vibes that come from human exploitation and environmental destruction.\u201d The growing number of people who use crystals, whether to \u201cdetoxify\u201d, reduce anxiety, or decorate iPhones must acknowledge their healing crystals are likely to have contributed to human trauma or environmental destruction. If more people knew this, wouldn\u2019t they begin rocking the boat? Campaigning as we have with food and fashion, people could start asking questions, demanding transparency about a crystal\u2019s origins, about the conditions of the mine, and the route it took to arrive in their warming hand. Because the power of a healing crystal is nothing compared with the power of a hundred thousand crystal buyers closing their purses. And now they know.

He is also an industrial-strength incompetent whose parliamentary supporters include just one of the ministers who served with him during his rackety two years as foreign secretary. Then there is the hefty back catalogue of offensive remarks and a private life that would stagger David Lloyd George or the Duke of Wellington. Rory Stewart, one of the other competitors in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservative-leadership\" title=\"\">leadership race</a>, has even suggested that Mr Johnson isn\u2019t fit to give proper instructions to the commanders of Britain\u2019s nuclear submarines. Not safe with the deterrent is an accusation that Tories sometimes level at Labour leaders, but I\u2019ve never before heard it hurled at a putative Conservative leader by a fellow blue.</p> <p>This is a short summary of reasons that other Tories supply to explain why prime minister Johnson is a reckless idea. You hear them often from Tories who are nevertheless voting to install him at Number 10. Written off as a busted flush by many colleagues just a few months ago, the boy who once talked about becoming \u201cking of the world\u201d is closer than ever to capturing the premiership of Britain.

One component of it is the widespread feeling among Tory MPs that their next leader has to be someone who campaigned for Brexit. This belief is not just confined to Leave-supporting Tory MPs. A lot of those who were Remainers think this as well. After the May experience, another Remainer as leader won\u2019t do, nor will a born-again Brexiter. This helps to explain why Jeremy Hunt, a very distant second in the first ballot, has not attracted as much support as he expected. The belief is that only a Brexiter stands any chance of selling a compromise to the party without being called a traitor to the cause. Another reason for thinking that the next Tory prime minister has to be a Brexiter is that putting one of them in charge is the only way for Brexiter fantasies to be tested to their final and irrefutable destruction.</p> <p>Mr Johnson\u2019s campaign is much slicker than the shambolic effort of three years ago. His <a href=\"https://amp.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/03/boris-johnson-tory-leadership-campaign-video\" title=\"\">leadership team includes Gavin Williamson</a>, who was a senior figure on Theresa May\u2019s winning campaign in 2016, and Andrew Mitchell, who was a senior figure on David Davis\u2019s losing campaign in 2005. Between these two former chief whips, they know both what to avoid and what to do in order to win.</p> <p>He has been further helped to a commanding early advantage by the state of the competition. Among non-Tories, Mr Stewart\u2019s attention-seizing and guerrilla-like campaign has made him the break-out star of the battle. Unfortunately for him, this is a contest in which non-Tories have precisely zero votes. Mr Hunt is failing to erase the perception that he is a smoother, blander version of Mrs May in a competition where it pays to be as different seeming to the outgoing prime minister as possible. Historically, successful leaders are often those who can fuse a compelling personal story with a narrative about spreading opportunity. Sajid Javid is trying to serve this recipe, but it\u2019s not pleasing the palate of enough of the diners he has to impress. Dominic Raab has tried too hard to be the macho man for the Brexit ultras. He unnerved even some of them by saying that he might attempt to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/13/suspending-parliament-break-brexit-deadlock-stretch-constitution\" title=\"\">shutter parliament</a> in order to ram through a no-deal Brexit. This is supposed to be a contest for the prime ministership of a mature democracy, not the chairmanship of the junta in a banana republic. Michael Gove is still struggling to recover his balance and answer the charges of hypocrisy after being compelled to admit that he has snorted mind-bending narcotics other than Brexit.</p> <p>In these contests, momentum tends to be self-feeding. When a bandwagon is rolling, the careerist seeks to clamber aboard while seats are still available. The Johnson team is telling wavering Conservative MPs that they should leap on the bandwagon before they are run over by it. I\u2019ve heard all sorts of explanations from Tories about why they are swallowing their misgivings and voting for the former foreign secretary, including one MP who revealed that his wife and children are threatening to punish him by changing the locks to the family home. Whatever the surface reasoning, it often boils down to the hope of wedging their bottoms into the back seat of a better class of government limo.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Farage is a giant magnet attracting clouds of iron filings in the direction of the former foreign secretary</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His big lead and the close bunching of the also-rans ought to be an advantage to the frontrunner in this week\u2019s sequence of elimination ballots. The energies of the following pack will be concentrated not on attacking him, but wrestling with each other to be the second name that will be put to Tory members. The climactic parliamentary phase may well involve some of the chicanery for which Tory leadership contests are renowned. My conversations with Tories suggest that Mr Gove is the rival most feared by the Johnson camp. No one knows the other man\u2019s vulnerable spots better than the fellow Brexiter who destroyed the last Johnsonian leadership bid with a last-minute betrayal. His team don\u2019t fancy a Johnson-Gove cage fight and would prefer the other finalist to be Mr Hunt. They may be able to contrive this outcome by telling some Johnson supporters to switch behind Hunt to ensure that he beats Gove in the last stages of the parliamentary balloting.</p> <p>He wouldn\u2019t be winning without the willingness of many Tory MPs to suspend their disbelief. They are working terrifically hard to persuade themselves that they will get <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/13/two-boris-johnsons-duplicity-tory-leadership\" title=\"\">the version of Boris Johnson that they like</a> without any of the features that repel them. So he\u2019s getting the backing of Brexit ultras who claim he\u2019ll deliver their version of the enterprise. He\u2019s also garnered support from one-nation-type Tories who are telling themselves that the former mayor of London is really a liberal centrist. This coalition is riddled with ideological contradictions and he has already made promises that he simply won\u2019t be able to fulfil. Don\u2019t imagine that Tory MPs aren\u2019t aware of this. The sentient ones are perfectly conscious of it as they equally know that he is a wild gamble that could go disastrously wrong for both their party and their country.</p> <p>Fear is the key to understanding why, fear most of all of Nigel Farage. This is the single most important factor propelling Boris Johnson towards Number 10. The leader of the Brexit party is not on the ballot paper, but he is the most influential personality in this contest. He is a giant magnet attracting clouds of iron filings in the direction of the former foreign secretary. By far and away his biggest-selling proposition to Tory MPs terrified of losing their seats is that he is the only one of them with the force of personality to stand any chance of suffocating the Brexit party and defeating Labour.</p> <p>And if it all goes horribly wrong? At least, I often hear Tories muse, a Johnson premiership \u201cwill cheer everyone up\u201d. When your party looks like it is going to hell in a handcart, they reckon you might as well hurtle towards the inferno with a smile on your face. I warn them not to repeat this in public because I am not convinced that the wider nation will be laughing with them.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",

They may be able to contrive this outcome by telling some Johnson supporters to switch behind Hunt to ensure that he beats Gove in the last stages of the parliamentary balloting. He wouldn\u2019t be winning without the willingness of many Tory MPs to suspend their disbelief. They are working terrifically hard to persuade themselves that they will get the version of Boris Johnson that they like without any of the features that repel them. So he\u2019s getting the backing of Brexit ultras who claim he\u2019ll deliver their version of the enterprise. He\u2019s also garnered support from one-nation-type Tories who are telling themselves that the former mayor of London is really a liberal centrist. This coalition is riddled with ideological contradictions and he has already made promises that he simply won\u2019t be able to fulfil. Don\u2019t imagine that Tory MPs aren\u2019t aware of this. The sentient ones are perfectly conscious of it as they equally know that he is a wild gamble that could go disastrously wrong for both their party and their country. Fear is the key to understanding why, fear most of all of Nigel Farage. This is the single most important factor propelling Boris Johnson towards Number 10. The leader of the Brexit party is not on the ballot paper, but he is the most influential personality in this contest. He is a giant magnet attracting clouds of iron filings in the direction of the former foreign secretary. By far and away his biggest-selling proposition to Tory MPs terrified of losing their seats is that he is the only one of them with the force of personality to stand any chance of suffocating the Brexit party and defeating Labour. And if it all goes horribly wrong? At least, I often hear Tories muse, a Johnson premiership \u201cwill cheer everyone up\u201d. When your party looks like it is going to hell in a handcart, they reckon you might as well hurtle towards the inferno with a smile on your face. I warn them not to repeat this in public because I am not convinced that the wider nation will be laughing with them. \u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer",

      "body": "<p>Late one afternoon last month, in a meeting room in the offices where I work in north London, I sat and wept. This is not something I make a habit of. My own tears were provoked by the tears of Judy Griffiths, a central interviewee in <em>The Unwanted: The Secret Windrush Files</em>, a documentary we had then just completed.</p> <p>Judy had come to our offices to watch sections of the programme, to let us know if she was happy with how we\u2019d portrayed her story. Tough, educated and resilient, she is one of a number of victims (or perhaps survivors) of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/08/home-office-told-of-windrush-errors-five-years-ago-experts-say\" title=\"\">Windrush </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/08/home-office-told-of-windrush-errors-five-years-ago-experts-say\" title=\"\">scandal </a>that we interviewed for the film.</p> <p>Even for her, with her level of drive and resourcefulness, taking on a cold, officious and target-driven <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/30/windrush-scandal-how-changed-uk-immigration-system\" title=\"\">immigration system</a> was draining and damaging. Yet, in one way, Judy was comparatively fortunate. She happened to have kept hold of some of the documents that the Home Office demanded in order to demonstrate her long residence in the UK. She was also able to track down other scraps of evidence needed to prove something that should never have been in question.</p> <p>That paper trail, gathered by a woman who has lived and worked in the UK for more than 50 years, included the antenatal records of her now adult children. Others caught in the dragnet of the so-called \u201chostile environment\u201d, and unable to provide similar documents, were dragged into the lower circles of immigration-law hell.</p> <p>I cried last month not only because Judy cried, but because I was enormously relieved that our film meant something to her. I don\u2019t know exactly what brought her to tears. My guess would be that seeing herself and her story framed within a TV documentary brought home, in new ways, the staggering injustice of what she has been through, and reminded her of the obvious \u2013 that none of it should ever have happened.</p> <p>But Judy also cried because the film contains an interview with a friend she had recently made and recently lost \u2013 Sarah O\u2019Conner, another victim of the scandal. Sarah had moved to Britain aged six and, after 51 years\u2019 residence, had suddenly been refused employment and then benefits. Like Judy she had been forced to become a campaigner for the rights of the so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/23/windrush-generation-will-get-uk-citizenship-says-amber-rudd\" title=\"\">Windrush </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/23/windrush-generation-will-get-uk-citizenship-says-amber-rudd\" title=\"\">generation</a>.

Even Piers Morgan looked genuinely hot under the collar on breakfast TV when he expressed outrage at the fact that Anthony Bryan \u2013 another of the interviewees in <em>The Unwanted</em> \u2013 was still waiting for his status to be resolved.</p> <p>It is testimony to the scale and severity of the Windrush scandal that it was able to command enough media bandwidth and enough headspace within the national consciousness to cut through the background Brexit hubbub. For an outrage to metastasize into full-blown, Defcon-1 national scandal in 2018 it needed to be really, really bad.</p> <p>During the final, farcical attempts to push her Brexit deal through parliament, Theresa May was said to have worried about her political \u201clegacy\u201d. Her place in history will only become apparent when the Brexit nightmare is, somehow, resolved. There is no question, however, about how May will be remembered by black Britons. Her legacy within that community is set in stone and has little to do with her three dismal years in Downing Street.</p> <p>May will be remembered as the home secretary who sent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/19/theresa-may-was-not-opposed-to-go-home-vans-official-accounts-suggest\" title=\"\">vans with \u201cGo Home\u201d blazoned on their sides</a> to patrol our multicultural cities. The politician who, in 2012, declared her intent \u201cto create, here in Britain, a really hostile environment for illegal immigrants\u201d.

The challenge came when people who had been enslaved under the laws that then governed Britain\u2019s slave colonies were brought to Britain by their \u201cowners\u201d. Some absconded and claimed their freedom. It fell to the judges to determine if those defined as human property in the colonies remained so once they set foot in Britain or, if by breathing in British air, they were freed and magically became legal persons.

Then, black and brown people who had been told their whole lives that they were British subjects with the right to come to the \u201cmother country\u201d began to exercise those rights. In 1948, Britain was asked to cash that promissory note. Instead, the charade was exposed because the principle of free movement within the empire, long a hallowed tenet of the imperial project, had in reality only ever been intended to apply to white people.</p> <p>Postwar Britain, battered and near bankrupt, was desperate to cling on to as much of the empire as possible \u2013 rebranding it the British Commonwealth. Politicians, both Labour and Conservative, were united in their determination that Britain should retain her status as a \u201cworld power\u201d \u2013 albeit a poor relation to the US and USSR in the age of the superpowers.. Key to achieving this, they believed, were the bonds between Britain and the nations of the old Commonwealth \u2013 Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa \u2013 sometimes tellingly referred to as the \u201cwhite dominions\u201d.</p> <p>When, in 1948, parliament passed a new <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/11-12/56/enacted\" title=\"\">British Nationality Act</a> the aim was to reaffirm existing rights that enabled the two-way flow, between Britain and the old Commonwealth, of people who were regularly described in postwar official documents as \u201cour stock\u201d, \u201cour people\u201d or people of \u201cBritish stock\u201d. What the politicians failed to predict was that even as they were debating the act, 492 black people from the Caribbean would board the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/22/windrush-story-not-a-rosy-one-even-before-ship-arrived\" title=\"\">Empire Windrush</a> and exercise their rights as British subjects to work and live in the UK.</p> <p>The big historical truth that we have yet to confront is wrapped up with the same painful truth that explains how the Windrush scandal of 2018 could have happened \u2013 that the arrival of the Empire Windrush in 1948 was unplanned and unexpected. The people on board were unwanted and their moment of arrival set in train two oppositional processes.</p> <p>It established 1948 as the symbolic beginning of the postwar migration that created modern, multiracial Britain. At the same time it provoked a political struggle that saw successive British governments, both Labour and Conservative, set out to design and introduce laws to limit what they called \u201ccoloured migration\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The deeper roots of the scandal lie not in laws but in beliefs. The belief that Britishness is the same as whiteness</p> <footer> <cite>David Olusoga</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The great dilemma they faced was that any act that put limits on migration of British subjects from all parts of the empire would inevitably limit the movement of white people from the \u201cwhite dominions\u201d. Whereas draft legislation that overtly targeted the black and brown people would damage Britain\u2019s standing in the world and undermine the creation of the Commonwealth \u2013 the rebranded, reimagined version of the empire that included newly independent states, as well as the old dominions. In an interview in 1954, Winston Churchill\u2019s private secretary Sir David Hunt explained the dilemma: \u201cThe minute we said we\u2019ve got to keep these black chaps out, the whole Commonwealth lark would have blown up.\u201d</p> <p>The political struggles of the period that followed the arrival of the Windrush are recorded on the pages of hundreds of documents held at the National Archives. What they reveal is that even before the Windrush set sail from Kingston, British politicians had concluded that \u201ccoloured migration\u201d automatically represented a \u201ccolour problem\u201d and was thus to be discouraged and curtailed. The other deeper and more fundamental and unquestioned belief that runs through those thousands of archival pages is that black and brown people could never really be British.</p> <p>The old racism of imperialism not only rendered the postwar political elite unable to see black people as full British citizens, it provided them with a whole glossary of stereotypes and preconceptions that they then deployed in order to justify their aim of introducing immigration controls. In the late 40s and early 50s, a series of studies was launched in Whitehall.</p> <p>The function of the studies was to find evidence of problems supposedly caused by the presence of black migrants. One study, by the Working Party on Coloured People Seeking Employment in the United Kingdom, reported in late 1953. It concluded, despite much evidence to the contrary, that \u201ccoloured workers\u201d struggled to find employment in the UK, and that such difficulties were caused by their \u201cirresponsibility, quarrelsomeness and lack of discipline\u201d. The report also stated that black men were \u201cslow mentally\u201d and in general were \u201cnot up to the standards required by British employers\u201d.</p> <p>British business came to a different conclusion. Several major employers not only hired Caribbean migrants, but actively recruited them directly from the West Indies. By 1956, London Transport was recruiting in Barbados, even loaning migrants the costs of their passage to Britain. British Rail placed ads in the Barbados Labour Office and the NHS appealed to West Indian women to come to Britain and train to become nurses. It was these companies that issued the invitation to the \u201cmother country\u201d that Britain\u2019s postwar governments withheld.</p> <p>Despite the efforts of five governmental studies there was no evidence that \u201ccoloured migration\u201d led to a \u201ccolour problem\u201d. Even worse, there was sparse evidence that the public was particularly interested. Minutes from meetings of Churchill\u2019s cabinet from the mid-50s reveal that politicians were well aware \u201ccoloured migration\u201d was not an issue about which there was any deep public concern.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"aaa90b3941d19494ff9f39e9bca48f4608c7cb73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aaa90b3941d19494ff9f39e9bca48f4608c7cb73/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators protest against the hostile environment immigration policy outside the Home Office in Westminster, London, in April 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators protest against the hostile environment immigration policy outside the Home Office in Westminster, London, in April 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a meeting in June 1955, the cabinet debated \u201cproposals for the appointment of an independent committee of enquiry into coloured migration\u201d, noting that \u201cthe first purpose of an enquiry should be to ensure that the public ... were made aware of the nature and extent of the problem: until this was more widely appreciated the need for restrictive legislation would not be recognised\u201d. In another meeting, in November 1955, the cabinet concluded that \u201cthe problem of colonial immigration has not yet aroused general public anxiety, although there was some concern mainly due to housing difficulties in a few localities where most of the recent immigrants were concentrated\u201d.</p> <p>It was not until 1962, after the public mood <em>had</em> grown more hostile, that Harold Macmillan\u2019s government finally hit upon a mechanism by which the migration of black and brown people could be limited without curtailing the movement of white citizens of the \u201cold Commonwealth\u201d. The 1962 Commonwealth Immigrants Act used a voucher system based upon employment prospects to determine who was able to enter the UK.</p> <p>A government working party, set up to explore the options, concluded that this was \u201cthe only workable method of controlling immigration from the Commonwealth without either bringing such immigration to a virtual standstill or ostensibly discriminating against immigrants on a basis of colour\u201d. The key word is \u201costensibly\u201d.</p> <p>Another confidential minute noted that while the new system \u201cwould apply equally to all parts of the Commonwealth, without distinction on ground of race and colour, in practice it would interfere to the minimum extent with the entry of persons from the \u2018old\u2019 Commonwealth\u201d. The then home secretary, Rab Butler, was clear that the act\u2019s \u201crestrictive effect is intended to, and would, in fact, operate on coloured people almost exclusively\u201d.</p> <p>The 1962 act was the great watershed, the end of the charade. And there are strands of legislative DNA that stretch from that moment, through the Immigration Act of 1971 and the later immigration laws passed under David Cameron, that removed the legal safeguards that shielded the Windrush generation, all the way to the Windrush scandal of 2018.</p> <p>The deeper historical roots of the scandal, however, lie not in laws but in beliefs. The belief that Britishness is the same as whiteness, and that black and brown people can never truly be British, no matter what the laws say or what is written on their passports. Such beliefs were held, almost universally, by postwar-era politicians.</p> <p>In the late 20th century, when the multiracial society they were unable to envisage emerged, such notions should have perished. That they did not goes some way to explaining how the scandal of 2018 happened.</p> <p><em>David Olusoga is speaking at a preview of The Unwanted: The Secret Windrush Files at the <a href=\"https://southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/136845-david-olusoga-secret-windrush-files-2019\" title=\"\">Southbank Centre in London at 7pm next Sunday</a> 23 June and the documentary is on BBC Two at 9pm on 24 June </em></p>",

Postwar Britain, battered and near bankrupt, was desperate to cling on to as much of the empire as possible \u2013 rebranding it the British Commonwealth. Politicians, both Labour and Conservative, were united in their determination that Britain should retain her status as a \u201cworld power\u201d \u2013 albeit a poor relation to the US and USSR in the age of the superpowers.. Key to achieving this, they believed, were the bonds between Britain and the nations of the old Commonwealth \u2013 Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa \u2013 sometimes tellingly referred to as the \u201cwhite dominions\u201d. When, in 1948, parliament passed a new British Nationality Act the aim was to reaffirm existing rights that enabled the two-way flow, between Britain and the old Commonwealth, of people who were regularly described in postwar official documents as \u201cour stock\u201d, \u201cour people\u201d or people of \u201cBritish stock\u201d. What the politicians failed to predict was that even as they were debating the act, 492 black people from the Caribbean would board the Empire Windrush and exercise their rights as British subjects to work and live in the UK. The big historical truth that we have yet to confront is wrapped up with the same painful truth that explains how the Windrush scandal of 2018 could have happened \u2013 that the arrival of the Empire Windrush in 1948 was unplanned and unexpected. The people on board were unwanted and their moment of arrival set in train two oppositional processes. It established 1948 as the symbolic beginning of the postwar migration that created modern, multiracial Britain. At the same time it provoked a political struggle that saw successive British governments, both Labour and Conservative, set out to design and introduce laws to limit what they called \u201ccoloured migration\u201d. The great dilemma they faced was that any act that put limits on migration of British subjects from all parts of the empire would inevitably limit the movement of white people from the \u201cwhite dominions\u201d. Whereas draft legislation that overtly targeted the black and brown people would damage Britain\u2019s standing in the world and undermine the creation of the Commonwealth \u2013 the rebranded, reimagined version of the empire that included newly independent states, as well as the old dominions. In an interview in 1954, Winston Churchill\u2019s private secretary Sir David Hunt explained the dilemma: \u201cThe minute we said we\u2019ve got to keep these black chaps out, the whole Commonwealth lark would have blown up.\u201d The political struggles of the period that followed the arrival of the Windrush are recorded on the pages of hundreds of documents held at the National Archives. What they reveal is that even before the Windrush set sail from Kingston, British politicians had concluded that \u201ccoloured migration\u201d automatically represented a \u201ccolour problem\u201d and was thus to be discouraged and curtailed. The other deeper and more fundamental and unquestioned belief that runs through those thousands of archival pages is that black and brown people could never really be British. The old racism of imperialism not only rendered the postwar political elite unable to see black people as full British citizens, it provided them with a whole glossary of stereotypes and preconceptions that they then deployed in order to justify their aim of introducing immigration controls. In the late 40s and early 50s, a series of studies was launched in Whitehall. The function of the studies was to find evidence of problems supposedly caused by the presence of black migrants. One study, by the Working Party on Coloured People Seeking Employment in the United Kingdom, reported in late 1953. It concluded, despite much evidence to the contrary, that \u201ccoloured workers\u201d struggled to find employment in the UK, and that such difficulties were caused by their \u201cirresponsibility, quarrelsomeness and lack of discipline\u201d. The report also stated that black men were \u201cslow mentally\u201d and in general were \u201cnot up to the standards required by British employers\u201d. British business came to a different conclusion. Several major employers not only hired Caribbean migrants, but actively recruited them directly from the West Indies. By 1956, London Transport was recruiting in Barbados, even loaning migrants the costs of their passage to Britain. British Rail placed ads in the Barbados Labour Office and the NHS appealed to West Indian women to come to Britain and train to become nurses. It was these companies that issued the invitation to the \u201cmother country\u201d that Britain\u2019s postwar governments withheld. Despite the efforts of five governmental studies there was no evidence that \u201ccoloured migration\u201d led to a \u201ccolour problem\u201d. Even worse, there was sparse evidence that the public was particularly interested. Minutes from meetings of Churchill\u2019s cabinet from the mid-50s reveal that politicians were well aware \u201ccoloured migration\u201d was not an issue about which there was any deep public concern. In a meeting in June 1955, the cabinet debated \u201cproposals for the appointment of an independent committee of enquiry into coloured migration\u201d, noting that \u201cthe first purpose of an enquiry should be to ensure that the public ... were made aware of the nature and extent of the problem: until this was more widely appreciated the need for restrictive legislation would not be recognised\u201d. In another meeting, in November 1955, the cabinet concluded that \u201cthe problem of colonial immigration has not yet aroused general public anxiety, although there was some concern mainly due to housing difficulties in a few localities where most of the recent immigrants were concentrated\u201d. It was not until 1962, after the public mood had grown more hostile, that Harold Macmillan\u2019s government finally hit upon a mechanism by which the migration of black and brown people could be limited without curtailing the movement of white citizens of the \u201cold Commonwealth\u201d. The 1962 Commonwealth Immigrants Act used a voucher system based upon employment prospects to determine who was able to enter the UK. A government working party, set up to explore the options, concluded that this was \u201cthe only workable method of controlling immigration from the Commonwealth without either bringing such immigration to a virtual standstill or ostensibly discriminating against immigrants on a basis of colour\u201d. The key word is \u201costensibly\u201d. Another confidential minute noted that while the new system \u201cwould apply equally to all parts of the Commonwealth, without distinction on ground of race and colour, in practice it would interfere to the minimum extent with the entry of persons from the \u2018old\u2019 Commonwealth\u201d. The then home secretary, Rab Butler, was clear that the act\u2019s \u201crestrictive effect is intended to, and would, in fact, operate on coloured people almost exclusively\u201d. The 1962 act was the great watershed, the end of the charade. And there are strands of legislative DNA that stretch from that moment, through the Immigration Act of 1971 and the later immigration laws passed under David Cameron, that removed the legal safeguards that shielded the Windrush generation, all the way to the Windrush scandal of 2018. The deeper historical roots of the scandal, however, lie not in laws but in beliefs. The belief that Britishness is the same as whiteness, and that black and brown people can never truly be British, no matter what the laws say or what is written on their passports. Such beliefs were held, almost universally, by postwar-era politicians. In the late 20th century, when the multiracial society they were unable to envisage emerged, such notions should have perished. That they did not goes some way to explaining how the scandal of 2018 happened.

Even Matt Berry couldn\u2019t save Year of the Rabbit from itself. A spoof Victorian London drama comedy of the sort seen only about a million times since the dawn of television, it wanted to be Ripper Street with giggles. It ended up being the Two Ronnies\u2019 \u201cphantom raspberry blower of old London town\u201d with, astonishingly, fewer laughs. And much much filth. The gags, it seems in hindsight, were all about disability, prostitutes and mud, and all done with a certain frenetic foul-mouthiness substituting for actual humour. I may have misread the opening episode, and it will doubtless be to the taste of some souls. But if this is the start of Channel 4\u2019s vaunted \u201csummer of comedy\u201d, bring on ye autumnal mists. I\u2019m proud to count myself a convert to women\u2019s (if not men\u2019s) football, and not just because my cousin\u2019s daughter last weekend skilfully carved her name into posterity as the first World Cup scorer for Scotland (a thrillzillion congratulations, Ms Emslie from all your Ferguson kin). Urgent and arty and gleeful, and so far without a sour male tantrummy rant, the women\u2019s game is, so arguably, what the \u201cbeautiful game\u201d was ever meant to be about, before the playground squalor and the racism and the rank fouls and the insane fees \u2013 and the coverage is hooking me. Twitter-spats about the \u201cgender-biased\u201d BBC panel (the likes of Gabby Logan, Alex Scott, Hope Solo and Gemma Fay attained insightful, analytical, professional levels that every bawbag-brained male pundit should shudder to dare to aspire to) being, all, um\u2026 women\u2026 leave me seething with headscratching wonderment. And, admittedly, a modicum of admiration for the mysteries of the universe: dinosaurs still exist! And some (like footballers) can be women!",

In March of this year, federal prosecutors revealed that certain wealthy American families paid for their children to get into the \u201cright\u201d elite universities. They did this by contacting a man called Rick Singer. Singer got the parents to have their kids categorised as having a learning disability. This meant that they could take their SAT or ACTs in a special centre, where a supervisor, paid off by Singer, would either take the child\u2019s test themselves or alter it so it had more correct answers (a high SAT/ACT score gets you into the best colleges). Sometimes this wasn\u2019t enough, so Singer would also arrange for the child to suddenly acquire an exceptional sporting talent, such as being a rowing cox or a \u201ckicker\u201d for American football.

Using real-life transcripts, actors voice the parts of Singer and his co-conspirators utterly convincingly; and there are a couple of subtle points made by contributors, including one who points out that, though this seems like a case of cash, it\u2019s actually a case of racism, too.</p> <p><em>Gangster Capitalism</em> seems to be setting itself up as a strand, rather than a one-off series, which is fair enough.

And every one of this great show\u2019s sponsors \u2013 clever phone-charging luggage, mattresses that adjust to different needs, delivery food whenever you want \u2013 are fulfilling an itch that doesn\u2019t really need scratching.

It has been reported that Facebook will not directly control the currency but that some members of the consortium will act as \u201cnodes\u201d within the system that can give the green light to transactions. Reports also suggest that hotels website Booking.com and the payments technology company Stripe have signed up. It is expected that Facebook will release a briefing on the new cryptocurrency this week. Concerns have been raised, however, that regulatory issues and Facebook\u2019s hitherto poor track record on data privacy and protection are likely to prove major hurdles on the way to making any cryptocurrency a success. Facebook is also looking at paying users fractions of a coin for activities such as viewing ads and interacting with content related to online shopping, in a system similar to the loyalty schemes run by retailers.",

      "body": "<p>I have been critical, I hope with good reason, of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s equivocation over what is rapidly becoming a pressing need to call another referendum. But credit where credit is due: at least the Labour leader attempted in the Commons last week to block the possibility of a no-deal Brexit \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/12/keir-starmer-urges-mps-to-back-safety-valve-to-stop-no-deal-brexit\" title=\"\">alas, without success</a>.</p> <p>In common with <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m00057m9\" title=\"\">this year\u2019s Reith lecturer</a>, Lord Sumption, I do not like referendums, and believe in representative democracy. Moreover, in keeping with Edmund Burke\u2019s address to the electors of Bristol some 250 years ago, I think MPs should regard themselves as representatives, not delegates. Unfortunately, in last week\u2019s vote, eight Labour MPs behaved as delegates of Leave constituencies and voted with the Gadarene rush of Conservative Brexiters.</p> <p>Sumption, while arguing that the law must not encroach too much on politics, acknowledges that representative democracy has gone wrong, and the extremists have taken over. Thus, whether or not they are real Leavers, Conservative claimants to the succession to the premiership behave as if they are.</p> <p>Like so many of us Remainers, Sumption believes the 2016 referendum was a mistake. It has produced three years of chaos, and we need another referendum to sort out the mess.</p> <p>And what a mess it is! There is economic and social chaos all around us. To take a specific example: during those three years, foreign direct investment in the UK has fallen by 30%, while it has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/93c681ca-7c9c-11e9-81d2-f785092ab560\" title=\"\">increased by 43% in the other 27 members of the EU</a>. And domestically generated investment \u2013 the seed corn of productivity and decent jobs \u2013 is also near collapse. The Bank of England estimates that, thanks to the uncertainty associated with Brexit, the level of investment in the economy is anything between 6% and 14% lower than it would have been.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What comparisons with the past bring to the surface is the sheer mediocrity of most of the present contenders</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And in his new book, <em>Not Working: Where Have All the Good Jobs Gone?</em>, Professor David Blanchflower convincingly demonstrates that behind the boasts of high employment lies the phenomenon of widespread underemployment, with many people working less than they want to, or in jobs way beneath their qualifications.</p> <p>And this is before we exit \u2013 if the likes of Boris Johnson bring us to the edge of the cliff. There are daily stories of bad economic and industrial news, but the slowdown so far is as nothing compared with the damage that will be wrought if the nonsense is not stopped. The CBI is getting desperate; the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, says a no-deal exit would be like taking \u201ca sledgehammer\u201d to the economy; and Whitehall is in justified panic about the terrifying prospect of leaving the customs union and the intricate network of supply chains provided by the single market.</p> <p>So what does the Conservative party do? It threatens to unite around a candidate, Johnson, who is publicly contemptuous of business, promises tax cuts for his supporters, and appears to be blissfully unaware or uncaring of the damage caused by almost a decade of austerity.</p> <p>Three months ago, the fashionable view at Westminster was that although the Conservative party at large might love Johnson, its elected representatives had more sense. But panic about Farage and the Brexit party have put the kibosh on that.</p> <p>Some commentators have found crumbs of comfort in the history of failed favourites in previous Tory leadership races. But what such comparisons bring to the surface is the sheer mediocrity of most of the present contenders, by comparison with the political giants of the past. In 1975, Margaret Thatcher defeated Edward Heath \u2013 they were both formidable figures \u2013 for the Tory leadership. In 1976, Jim Callaghan defeated Denis Healey, Roy Jenkins and Tony Crosland, among others.</p> <p>Last week I spoke to Sir Bernard Ingham, Mrs Thatcher\u2019s press secretary, now 86 but as sharp as ever. Although a Brexiter himself, he does not know whether Thatcher would have been, given that the European single market was one of her greatest achievements. Lord (Charles) Powell, the official who also worked closely with her, is quite firmly of the view that, while fighting her corner in Europe, she would not have contemplated leaving.</p> <p>Ingham points out that Thatcher did not like the aim of \u201cever-closer union\u201d: but the UK has a get-out-of-jail-free card for that, and it is doubtful whether the Germans are as keen as the French on the original goal.</p> <p>The prospect of no deal would be such a calamity that, although the Tories are flocking round Johnson to save the party, the consequences would make their previous losses of reputation for economic competence \u2013 such as Black Wednesday \u2013 look like a vicarage tea party.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I have been critical, I hope with good reason, of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s equivocation over what is rapidly becoming a pressing need to call another referendum. But credit where credit is due: at least the Labour leader attempted in the Commons last week to block the possibility of a no-deal Brexit \u2013 alas, without success. In common with this year\u2019s Reith lecturer, Lord Sumption, I do not like referendums, and believe in representative democracy. Moreover, in keeping with Edmund Burke\u2019s address to the electors of Bristol some 250 years ago, I think MPs should regard themselves as representatives, not delegates. Unfortunately, in last week\u2019s vote, eight Labour MPs behaved as delegates of Leave constituencies and voted with the Gadarene rush of Conservative Brexiters. Sumption, while arguing that the law must not encroach too much on politics, acknowledges that representative democracy has gone wrong, and the extremists have taken over. Thus, whether or not they are real Leavers, Conservative claimants to the succession to the premiership behave as if they are. Like so many of us Remainers, Sumption believes the 2016 referendum was a mistake. It has produced three years of chaos, and we need another referendum to sort out the mess. And what a mess it is! There is economic and social chaos all around us. To take a specific example: during those three years, foreign direct investment in the UK has fallen by 30%, while it has increased by 43% in the other 27 members of the EU. And domestically generated investment \u2013 the seed corn of productivity and decent jobs \u2013 is also near collapse. The Bank of England estimates that, thanks to the uncertainty associated with Brexit, the level of investment in the economy is anything between 6% and 14% lower than it would have been. And in his new book, Not Working: Where Have All the Good Jobs Gone?, Professor David Blanchflower convincingly demonstrates that behind the boasts of high employment lies the phenomenon of widespread underemployment, with many people working less than they want to, or in jobs way beneath their qualifications. And this is before we exit \u2013 if the likes of Boris Johnson bring us to the edge of the cliff. There are daily stories of bad economic and industrial news, but the slowdown so far is as nothing compared with the damage that will be wrought if the nonsense is not stopped. The CBI is getting desperate; the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, says a no-deal exit would be like taking \u201ca sledgehammer\u201d to the economy; and Whitehall is in justified panic about the terrifying prospect of leaving the customs union and the intricate network of supply chains provided by the single market. So what does the Conservative party do? It threatens to unite around a candidate, Johnson, who is publicly contemptuous of business, promises tax cuts for his supporters, and appears to be blissfully unaware or uncaring of the damage caused by almost a decade of austerity. Three months ago, the fashionable view at Westminster was that although the Conservative party at large might love Johnson, its elected representatives had more sense. But panic about Farage and the Brexit party have put the kibosh on that. Some commentators have found crumbs of comfort in the history of failed favourites in previous Tory leadership races. But what such comparisons bring to the surface is the sheer mediocrity of most of the present contenders, by comparison with the political giants of the past. In 1975, Margaret Thatcher defeated Edward Heath \u2013 they were both formidable figures \u2013 for the Tory leadership. In 1976, Jim Callaghan defeated Denis Healey, Roy Jenkins and Tony Crosland, among others. Last week I spoke to Sir Bernard Ingham, Mrs Thatcher\u2019s press secretary, now 86 but as sharp as ever. Although a Brexiter himself, he does not know whether Thatcher would have been, given that the European single market was one of her greatest achievements. Lord (Charles) Powell, the official who also worked closely with her, is quite firmly of the view that, while fighting her corner in Europe, she would not have contemplated leaving. Ingham points out that Thatcher did not like the aim of \u201cever-closer union\u201d: but the UK has a get-out-of-jail-free card for that, and it is doubtful whether the Germans are as keen as the French on the original goal. The prospect of no deal would be such a calamity that, although the Tories are flocking round Johnson to save the party, the consequences would make their previous losses of reputation for economic competence \u2013 such as Black Wednesday \u2013 look like a vicarage tea party.",

      "body": "<p>\u2018Art and life \u2013 there is no separation between the two,\u201d Oscar Murillo says. It is a line that stays in the mind although it is thrown out casually, part of a longer conversation. What is clear is that Murillo\u2019s life is jammed with work to the point where art and life have become almost indistinguishable. He has a solo exhibition, <a href=\"https://www.kettlesyard.co.uk/events/oscar-murillo/\" title=\"\">Violent Amnesia</a> (his first in the UK since 2013), at Kettle\u2019s Yard in Cambridge; there is a show at <a href=\"https://www.davidzwirner.com/artists/oscar-murillo\" title=\"\">David Zwirner</a>\u2019s London gallery; he is reviving a show in Berlin; and, later this month, a further show will open at <a href=\"https://theshed.org/\" title=\"\">The Shed in New York</a>.</p> <p>Murillo is also on this year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/may/01/turner-prize-2019-thrilling-shortlist-offers-sci-fi-sculpture-and-gunshot-soundscapes\" title=\"\">Turner </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/may/01/turner-prize-2019-thrilling-shortlist-offers-sci-fi-sculpture-and-gunshot-soundscapes\" title=\"\">prize shortlist</a>, saluted by the jury for the way he \u201cpushes the boundaries of materials\u201d \u2013 especially in his paintings. In addition, he has been commissioned to do a piece for <a href=\"https://2019.artnight.london/artist/oscar-murillo/\" title=\"\">Art Night in Walthamstow</a>, part of the mayor of London\u2019s first London Borough of Culture celebrations in Waltham Forest. </p> <p>It is a sunny morning, and Murillo arrives late at his Tottenham studio on a bicycle, pleading \u201cthe school run\u201d and opening the door to a high-ceilinged, handsome space \u2013 several rooms \u2013 in which the first thing one notices is a lifesize ragdoll lying on its back like the victim of a crime scene (about these figures, more later). On the opposite wall are two imposing floor-to-ceiling oils in red, black and blue. His paintings are workouts \u2013 part of a series called <em>Catalyst</em> \u2013 with a fevered cross-hatching of lines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"791b3aaba0cfb19ff344f074950458ea8fd5666f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/791b3aaba0cfb19ff344f074950458ea8fd5666f/0_0_2476_3000/825.jpg\" alt=\"Violent Amnesia, 2014-2018 by Oscar Murillo, installed at Kettle\u2019s Yard, Cambridge.\" width=\"825\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Violent Amnesia, 2014-2018 by Oscar Murillo, installed at Kettle\u2019s Yard, Cambridge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Hollow/\u00a9 Oscar Murillo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Their colours carry across the room like voices that cannot be ignored, seeming still to contain the energy with which they were produced. It is only when you look close up that you see the mix of materials: cotton, linen and funereal velvet. He talks about the work as \u201cmark making\u201d. He says it is \u201ctherapeutic\u201d. There is no mistaking its instinctive brilliance. Nor is it difficult to imagine how it was that, about seven years ago, while still doing an MA at the Royal College of Art in his early 20s, he was \u201cdiscovered\u201d.</p> <p>Success is a mix of luck and talent \u2013 Murillo has both, and his rise has been meteoric. He became \u2013 thanks, in part, to Donald and Mera Rubell, the Miami-based collectors of contemporary art \u2013 an art world phenomenon. In 2013, at Phillips auction house in New York, one of his paintings was estimated at $30,000, and fetched $401,000. But there can be a downside to over-exposure, and from some quarters the critical sour grapes cannot have been easy for a young man (he is now 33). </p> <p>Murillo has such a gravity of expression that his smile comes as a relief. There is a combative defensiveness, too, mixed up with his generosity. His black jacket is zipped up to the collar on this warm day. He wears a single earring, and his hair is on the edge of exclamatory. He is, unmistakably, a Londoner in his cool garb and yet \u2013 for ever \u2013 a Colombian. The connection becomes clear on arrival, as he brews an espresso. Generously, he offers me, as a present, a packet of coffee \u2013 Valle del Cauca, Roldanillo, from western Colombia, where he was born in a small town called La Paila. He searches his phone for an image of the breathtakingly beautiful blue-green valley where the coffee was grown. A tiny image, so far from Tottenham. We exclaim over it and sit down to talk.</p> <p>There is in Murillo\u2019s work a disturbance, a drama, a sense that paint itself is on the move \u2013 this is the defining effect of the Kettle\u2019s Yard show. And yet the work is arresting in the fullest sense: you are stopped in your tracks by a blackened canvas hanging in your way like a chaotic garment, part brick-shaped patchwork, part frenzied scribble. Beyond, is a bold, ongoing installation called <em>The Institute of Reconciliation</em>. The floor is covered in black, cast-off canvases \u2013 sails turning into a sea. These have been hurled by Murillo against the gallery\u2019s white wall, which is now covered in black smudges like the whispered memory of a fight.</p> <p>Over the road, in tiny St Peter\u2019s church, there is an astonishing congregation of Murillo\u2019s stricken, papier-mache-faced models (in Colombia, they burn effigies \u2013 usually of politicians \u2013 at New Year). These ordinary folk sit in pews (purchased from a defunct church in Greenwich) that have been attacked by Murillo with an axe. They seem to await an explanation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3ee93686bd739d594ecf80518b1ad4da5d5af2e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ee93686bd739d594ecf80518b1ad4da5d5af2e0/424_771_7650_4627/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Institute of Reconciliation, 2014-ongoing, installed at St Peter\u2019s Church as part of Murillo\u2019s Violent Amnesia show at Kettle\u2019s Yard, Cambridge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"605\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Institute of Reconciliation, 2014-ongoing, installed at St Peter\u2019s Church as part of Murillo\u2019s Violent Amnesia show at Kettle\u2019s Yard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Hollow / Kettle's Yard</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He has always been a versatile artist (painting, video, sound works and performances) and with a particularly authoritative sense of theatre. His most famous piece was his 2014 recreation of a factory from his home town, called <em><a href=\"http://www.mercantilenovel.com/\" title=\"\">A Mercantile Novel</a></em><em>,</em> complete with Colombian workers who brought their production line of chocolate-covered marshmallows to David Zwirner\u2019s gallery in New York. Some critics thought Oscar and the chocolate factory gimmicky, but no one could deny his daring. </p> <p>I decide to risk the million-dollar question: how does he define art? He is a nomadic conversationalist, confessing that his talk is as \u201ccurving\u201d as a mountain road \u2013 in a Colombian landscape, maybe.</p> <p>\u201cThere are two parallel answers to this question,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s important to be aware of art history. I went to Westminster University, where there was an incredible history of art tutor. This set the tone for my career. We went through art history chronologically. You consider how art interacts with science, politics and religion. As an 18-year-old, you begin to understand the marriage between art and life. You compare historical patronage with the contemporary context.\u201d</p> <p>Art history gave him a \u201ccompass\u201d and a \u201cpermission\u201d and a \u201cconfidence\u201d to do his own thing.</p> <p>\u201cBut history is history and you think: now let me forge my own path, ignoring what is allowed or not allowed\u2026 just going for it.\u201d</p> <p>Asked how he feels about being on the Turner prize shortlist, he is reluctant to expand.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My work's been embedded in social discourse for as long as I can remember, and focused on family. That\u2019s what matters</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cArt is an echo chamber and artists are often in a little bubble.\u201d The Turner prize is valuable as a \u201cvessel of discourse\u201d. But is he stressed about it? \u201cNot at all.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cJust going for it\u201d means incessant work. He describes himself as a \u201crestless spirit\u201d for whom migration is a problematic subject. He has a way of anticipating difficult conversations before they have materialised: \u201cI\u2019m not interested in a conversation about migration in relation to me; my work does not come from that,\u201d he warns.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, migration has a tendency to overpower: \u201cIt can be too easy to say that being a migrant is a key to identity.\u201d</p> <p>Murillo came to Hackney, east London, from Colombia at a time of economic meltdown in his country. He was 10 and spoke no English at all \u2013 which he has described as \u201cconfusing.\u201d</p> <p>In the Kettle\u2019s Yard show, there is an extraordinary sound piece called <em>My Name </em><em>Is Belisario</em>, narrated by Murillo\u2019s father in Spanish, about migrating to the UK, which is translated into English, French, German, Hebrew and Arabic. You tune into this babel discontinuously, experiencing his father\u2019s dislocation vicariously through sound.</p> <p>\u201cLike many people throughout history, my father took a decision rooted in desperation, curiosity and desire that radically changed the course of our family\u2019s history. A lot of my improvisation is rooted in my father\u2019s will as a human being, his restlessness, his desire to go beyond his limited existence.\u201d</p> <p>His father looked at London on a world map and asked himself: \u201cWhy not try it over there in that country?\u201d It is moving to learn that he wept all the way from Colombia to London on the plane \u2013 distraught at leaving family behind.</p> <p>Does Murillo think about how different his own life might have been had his father not taken the radical decision to come to the UK?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c6d0278b9f0110c3468c219096f02dc06e7ce2b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6d0278b9f0110c3468c219096f02dc06e7ce2b9/0_422_4788_3026/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Murillo in his studio with one of his stuffed figures.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"632\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Murillo in his studio with one of his stuffed figures.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOf course\u2026 I think about it constantly. I\u2019d most likely have been working in a factory [the marshmallow factory, presumably]. There is a 70% chance that would have been the case.\u201d</p> <p>And where is home emotionally \u2013 Tottenham? Colombia?</p> <p>\u201cColombia is an incredibly racist and hypocritical country with a quasi-apartheid system. I have this repetitive, waking dream of being in a large water tank, pitch-black. Someone is submerging the top of my head, oppressing me, holding me down, and I have only a little oxygen left. They pull me back up until I\u2019m conscious and able to continue with existence. That is what Colombia is like. The oxygen is the beautiful landscape I just showed you. It\u2019s that beauty in nature that keeps people in Colombia alive. People have this existence of \u2013 you name it \u2013 corruption, racism, oppression. I\u2019m not going to romanticise it at all. It is a terrible country.\u201d</p> <p>He goes back there often, he says.</p> <p>It is easy to present Murillo\u2019s life as an over-simplified rags-to-riches story \u2013 to emphasise that he was working as a cleaner in the Gherkin building in the City when he first made a name for himself (the Gherkin, in this Cinderella-esque context, ought to have been a pumpkin). But this take on his story nettles him, because the reality was other \u2013 he was a teaching assistant before becoming a cleaner: \u201cThe story of me as a cleaner is more sensational than the story of me as a teaching assistant in schools \u2013 trying to forge a career as an artist.\u201d</p> <p>It was during the school holidays, he explains, when he was able to work full-time as an artist, that \u201cthe penny dropped\u201d. He saw he needed more time for his art.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4eb3b4bd40d870635dc69979f738bb39bc1ef302\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4eb3b4bd40d870635dc69979f738bb39bc1ef302/0_0_1280_1431/894.jpg\" alt=\"Untitled (Drawings off the wall), the painting that sold for $401,000 rather than an estimated $30,000 at a New York auction in 2011\" width=\"894\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Untitled (Drawings off the wall), the painting that sold for $401,000 rather than an estimated $30,000 at a New York auction in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zach Feuer Gallery, New York / Phillips.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMy priority had never been the teaching \u2013 that was just a really sad way of making money. But if you think about cleaning, it\u2019s a beautiful thing, because the only sacrifice you have to make is to wake up pretty early [laughs]. When I worked in the Gherkin, I\u2019d wake up at four in the morning \u2013 which in the summer was perfect because it is already daylight \u2013 and I\u2019d cycle from Dalston to Liverpool Street, a really nice cycle ride, and see busloads of migrants going to the city. And then I\u2019d get there and there\u2019d be nobody there. How much dirt can an office worker produce? It\u2019s very minimal. And then, from 9 o\u2019clock until I was really tired, I could go on working [on his art] \u2013 my entire day was free.\u201d</p> <p>And when it was no longer financially necessary to work as a cleaner (people used to talk about \u201cthe Murillo effect\u201d when discussing the art market), was there any pressure in finding himself suddenly wealthy and conspicuous?</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Where is the peril? What is the concern? When you have an Instagram or Facebook account, most people show the best of themselves, a false profile. Beautiful selfies, holiday pictures, nice hotels. Yet when you meet that person, you\u2019ll know that is far from the truth; they have a very normal existence, even if they have made it big. The content of my work is social investigation and collaborative. It has been embedded in social discourse for as long as I can remember, and focused on family life. That\u2019s what matters. You are never going to catch me living a life of lavishness, because that is not interesting. And if working with a successful commercial gallery and selling my work means an income, then that is shared among the people I love \u2013 my extended family and friends.\u201d</p> <p>There is no overstating the importance of family to Murillo.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m interested in the wellbeing family brings,\u201d he says. \u201cThat I can have the people I care about round me is a huge virtue.\u201d</p> <p>He has two young daughters and tells me he is determined not to steer his children in an artistic direction \u2013 it matters to him that they find their own path.</p> <p>\u201cMy eldest daughter, Valentina, who is nine years old, has an innate interest in art; and once, when we were in New York where I was doing a residency, at two years old she got completely covered in paint \u2013 I have the picture of her burnt in my memory\u2026 a beautiful sight. But pushing kids towards art because I\u2019m an artist? No, I do not want to impose myself.\u201d </p> <p>His family are to be an important part of Walthamstow\u2019s Art Night. He is inviting more than 30 family members and friends to take part. \u201cI\u2019m going to sign them up as members,\u201d he says. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.walthamstowtradeshall.com/\" title=\"\">Walthamstow</a><a href=\"http://www.walthamstowtradeshall.com/\" title=\"\"> Trades Hall</a> is a club for working people. Murillo tells me in advance that it\u2019s a sense of the time warp that inspires him when visiting the place: \u201cGentrification has involved social destruction, but walking into this members\u2019 club is like walking 30 or 40 years back in time. It gives you an understanding of a society that has become marginalised.\u201d</p> <p>The building looks as if it has worked and partied hard for decades. The letters on its front door are like a few teeth hanging on in an old man\u2019s mouth. T AM OW TR DES A. The club was established in 1920 and now has more than 200 members, with a core group of elderly people (membership \u00a335 per year). Loyal club member Brenda Shearing, who has been on the committee for 17 years, shows me round and says she hopes the club will \u201cgo on for ever\u201d.</p> <p>Clubs like this are closing down across the UK, and Murillo\u2019s intervention will, they hope, encourage a younger membership \u2013 people who want to commit time and TLC to the place. In a later phone call, Murillo talks about \u201clong-term commitment\u2026 I don\u2019t want Art Night simply to be a gesture\u201d. Helen Nisbet, artistic director of the event, suggests that his family and friends will bring \u201ca new conversation and culture\u201d to the place. And his family\u2019s membership money will contribute to the club\u2019s future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a5536970fd249b074faa944b2c262f2164070d5a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5536970fd249b074faa944b2c262f2164070d5a/0_309_8424_5113/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Installation shot of Violent Amnesia at Kettle\u2019s Yard\" width=\"1000\" height=\"607\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Installation shot from Violent Amnesia at Kettle\u2019s Yard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Hollow / Kettle's Yard</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Visitors to Art Night can look forward to bingo, live music and a large dance floor. In the 70s and 80s, dancers used to queue round the block to get in. And on 22 June, Cathy, one of the club\u2019s oldest members, will celebrate her 90th birthday here, with a line-up of crooners. She has been informed about Murillo\u2019s performance \u2013 she was offered the option to celebrate her birthday on another night, but is staying put. Besides, Murillo will not disturb her, as he is to perform outside. His inspiration will be the 1987 Proclaimers song Letter from America (sung a cappella).</p> <p>I spent the evening thinking about</p> <p>All the blood that flowed away</p> <p>Across the ocean to the second chance</p> <p>I wonder how it got on</p> <p>When it reached the promised land?</p> <p>These powerful lyrics are about people affected by the destruction of industry in the Scottish lowlands in the 1980s, and look back to the 18th-and 19th-century Highland Clearances. There is no puzzle about why they should speak to Murillo or to any migrant who has ever searched for a promised land.</p> <p>In 2016, Murillo famously <a href=\"http://www.artnews.com/2016/04/11/oscar-murillo-deported-from-australia-after-destroying-his-passport-mid-flight-in-protest/\" title=\"\">tore up his British passport</a> (he also had a Colombian one) and flushed it down the toilet of a plane en route to Sydney (he was detained in Sydney, deported to Singapore, eventually returned to Britain).

      "bodyText": "\u2018Art and life \u2013 there is no separation between the two,\u201d Oscar Murillo says. It is a line that stays in the mind although it is thrown out casually, part of a longer conversation. What is clear is that Murillo\u2019s life is jammed with work to the point where art and life have become almost indistinguishable. He has a solo exhibition, Violent Amnesia (his first in the UK since 2013), at Kettle\u2019s Yard in Cambridge; there is a show at David Zwirner\u2019s London gallery; he is reviving a show in Berlin; and, later this month, a further show will open at The Shed in New York. Murillo is also on this year\u2019s Turner prize shortlist, saluted by the jury for the way he \u201cpushes the boundaries of materials\u201d \u2013 especially in his paintings. In addition, he has been commissioned to do a piece for Art Night in Walthamstow, part of the mayor of London\u2019s first London Borough of Culture celebrations in Waltham Forest. It is a sunny morning, and Murillo arrives late at his Tottenham studio on a bicycle, pleading \u201cthe school run\u201d and opening the door to a high-ceilinged, handsome space \u2013 several rooms \u2013 in which the first thing one notices is a lifesize ragdoll lying on its back like the victim of a crime scene (about these figures, more later). On the opposite wall are two imposing floor-to-ceiling oils in red, black and blue. His paintings are workouts \u2013 part of a series called Catalyst \u2013 with a fevered cross-hatching of lines. Their colours carry across the room like voices that cannot be ignored, seeming still to contain the energy with which they were produced. It is only when you look close up that you see the mix of materials: cotton, linen and funereal velvet. He talks about the work as \u201cmark making\u201d. He says it is \u201ctherapeutic\u201d. There is no mistaking its instinctive brilliance. Nor is it difficult to imagine how it was that, about seven years ago, while still doing an MA at the Royal College of Art in his early 20s, he was \u201cdiscovered\u201d. Success is a mix of luck and talent \u2013 Murillo has both, and his rise has been meteoric. He became \u2013 thanks, in part, to Donald and Mera Rubell, the Miami-based collectors of contemporary art \u2013 an art world phenomenon. In 2013, at Phillips auction house in New York, one of his paintings was estimated at $30,000, and fetched $401,000. But there can be a downside to over-exposure, and from some quarters the critical sour grapes cannot have been easy for a young man (he is now 33). Murillo has such a gravity of expression that his smile comes as a relief. There is a combative defensiveness, too, mixed up with his generosity. His black jacket is zipped up to the collar on this warm day. He wears a single earring, and his hair is on the edge of exclamatory. He is, unmistakably, a Londoner in his cool garb and yet \u2013 for ever \u2013 a Colombian. The connection becomes clear on arrival, as he brews an espresso. Generously, he offers me, as a present, a packet of coffee \u2013 Valle del Cauca, Roldanillo, from western Colombia, where he was born in a small town called La Paila. He searches his phone for an image of the breathtakingly beautiful blue-green valley where the coffee was grown. A tiny image, so far from Tottenham. We exclaim over it and sit down to talk. There is in Murillo\u2019s work a disturbance, a drama, a sense that paint itself is on the move \u2013 this is the defining effect of the Kettle\u2019s Yard show. And yet the work is arresting in the fullest sense: you are stopped in your tracks by a blackened canvas hanging in your way like a chaotic garment, part brick-shaped patchwork, part frenzied scribble. Beyond, is a bold, ongoing installation called The Institute of Reconciliation. The floor is covered in black, cast-off canvases \u2013 sails turning into a sea. These have been hurled by Murillo against the gallery\u2019s white wall, which is now covered in black smudges like the whispered memory of a fight. Over the road, in tiny St Peter\u2019s church, there is an astonishing congregation of Murillo\u2019s stricken, papier-mache-faced models (in Colombia, they burn effigies \u2013 usually of politicians \u2013 at New Year). These ordinary folk sit in pews (purchased from a defunct church in Greenwich) that have been attacked by Murillo with an axe. They seem to await an explanation. He has always been a versatile artist (painting, video, sound works and performances) and with a particularly authoritative sense of theatre. His most famous piece was his 2014 recreation of a factory from his home town, called A Mercantile Novel, complete with Colombian workers who brought their production line of chocolate-covered marshmallows to David Zwirner\u2019s gallery in New York. Some critics thought Oscar and the chocolate factory gimmicky, but no one could deny his daring. I decide to risk the million-dollar question: how does he define art? He is a nomadic conversationalist, confessing that his talk is as \u201ccurving\u201d as a mountain road \u2013 in a Colombian landscape, maybe. \u201cThere are two parallel answers to this question,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s important to be aware of art history. I went to Westminster University, where there was an incredible history of art tutor. This set the tone for my career. We went through art history chronologically. You consider how art interacts with science, politics and religion. As an 18-year-old, you begin to understand the marriage between art and life. You compare historical patronage with the contemporary context.\u201d Art history gave him a \u201ccompass\u201d and a \u201cpermission\u201d and a \u201cconfidence\u201d to do his own thing. \u201cBut history is history and you think: now let me forge my own path, ignoring what is allowed or not allowed\u2026 just going for it.\u201d Asked how he feels about being on the Turner prize shortlist, he is reluctant to expand. \u201cArt is an echo chamber and artists are often in a little bubble.\u201d The Turner prize is valuable as a \u201cvessel of discourse\u201d. But is he stressed about it? \u201cNot at all.\u201d \u201cJust going for it\u201d means incessant work. He describes himself as a \u201crestless spirit\u201d for whom migration is a problematic subject. He has a way of anticipating difficult conversations before they have materialised: \u201cI\u2019m not interested in a conversation about migration in relation to me; my work does not come from that,\u201d he warns. What\u2019s more, migration has a tendency to overpower: \u201cIt can be too easy to say that being a migrant is a key to identity.\u201d Murillo came to Hackney, east London, from Colombia at a time of economic meltdown in his country. He was 10 and spoke no English at all \u2013 which he has described as \u201cconfusing.\u201d In the Kettle\u2019s Yard show, there is an extraordinary sound piece called My Name Is Belisario, narrated by Murillo\u2019s father in Spanish, about migrating to the UK, which is translated into English, French, German, Hebrew and Arabic. You tune into this babel discontinuously, experiencing his father\u2019s dislocation vicariously through sound. \u201cLike many people throughout history, my father took a decision rooted in desperation, curiosity and desire that radically changed the course of our family\u2019s history. A lot of my improvisation is rooted in my father\u2019s will as a human being, his restlessness, his desire to go beyond his limited existence.\u201d His father looked at London on a world map and asked himself: \u201cWhy not try it over there in that country?\u201d It is moving to learn that he wept all the way from Colombia to London on the plane \u2013 distraught at leaving family behind. Does Murillo think about how different his own life might have been had his father not taken the radical decision to come to the UK? \u201cOf course\u2026 I think about it constantly. I\u2019d most likely have been working in a factory [the marshmallow factory, presumably]. There is a 70% chance that would have been the case.\u201d And where is home emotionally \u2013 Tottenham? Colombia? \u201cColombia is an incredibly racist and hypocritical country with a quasi-apartheid system. I have this repetitive, waking dream of being in a large water tank, pitch-black. Someone is submerging the top of my head, oppressing me, holding me down, and I have only a little oxygen left. They pull me back up until I\u2019m conscious and able to continue with existence. That is what Colombia is like. The oxygen is the beautiful landscape I just showed you. It\u2019s that beauty in nature that keeps people in Colombia alive. People have this existence of \u2013 you name it \u2013 corruption, racism, oppression. I\u2019m not going to romanticise it at all. It is a terrible country.\u201d He goes back there often, he says. It is easy to present Murillo\u2019s life as an over-simplified rags-to-riches story \u2013 to emphasise that he was working as a cleaner in the Gherkin building in the City when he first made a name for himself (the Gherkin, in this Cinderella-esque context, ought to have been a pumpkin). But this take on his story nettles him, because the reality was other \u2013 he was a teaching assistant before becoming a cleaner: \u201cThe story of me as a cleaner is more sensational than the story of me as a teaching assistant in schools \u2013 trying to forge a career as an artist.\u201d It was during the school holidays, he explains, when he was able to work full-time as an artist, that \u201cthe penny dropped\u201d. He saw he needed more time for his art. \u201cMy priority had never been the teaching \u2013 that was just a really sad way of making money. But if you think about cleaning, it\u2019s a beautiful thing, because the only sacrifice you have to make is to wake up pretty early [laughs]. When I worked in the Gherkin, I\u2019d wake up at four in the morning \u2013 which in the summer was perfect because it is already daylight \u2013 and I\u2019d cycle from Dalston to Liverpool Street, a really nice cycle ride, and see busloads of migrants going to the city. And then I\u2019d get there and there\u2019d be nobody there. How much dirt can an office worker produce? It\u2019s very minimal. And then, from 9 o\u2019clock until I was really tired, I could go on working [on his art] \u2013 my entire day was free.\u201d And when it was no longer financially necessary to work as a cleaner (people used to talk about \u201cthe Murillo effect\u201d when discussing the art market), was there any pressure in finding himself suddenly wealthy and conspicuous? \u201cWhat do you mean? Where is the peril? What is the concern? When you have an Instagram or Facebook account, most people show the best of themselves, a false profile. Beautiful selfies, holiday pictures, nice hotels. Yet when you meet that person, you\u2019ll know that is far from the truth; they have a very normal existence, even if they have made it big. The content of my work is social investigation and collaborative. It has been embedded in social discourse for as long as I can remember, and focused on family life. That\u2019s what matters. You are never going to catch me living a life of lavishness, because that is not interesting. And if working with a successful commercial gallery and selling my work means an income, then that is shared among the people I love \u2013 my extended family and friends.\u201d There is no overstating the importance of family to Murillo. \u201cI\u2019m interested in the wellbeing family brings,\u201d he says. \u201cThat I can have the people I care about round me is a huge virtue.\u201d He has two young daughters and tells me he is determined not to steer his children in an artistic direction \u2013 it matters to him that they find their own path. \u201cMy eldest daughter, Valentina, who is nine years old, has an innate interest in art; and once, when we were in New York where I was doing a residency, at two years old she got completely covered in paint \u2013 I have the picture of her burnt in my memory\u2026 a beautiful sight. But pushing kids towards art because I\u2019m an artist? No, I do not want to impose myself.\u201d His family are to be an important part of Walthamstow\u2019s Art Night. He is inviting more than 30 family members and friends to take part. \u201cI\u2019m going to sign them up as members,\u201d he says. Walthamstow Trades Hall is a club for working people. Murillo tells me in advance that it\u2019s a sense of the time warp that inspires him when visiting the place: \u201cGentrification has involved social destruction, but walking into this members\u2019 club is like walking 30 or 40 years back in time. It gives you an understanding of a society that has become marginalised.\u201d The building looks as if it has worked and partied hard for decades. The letters on its front door are like a few teeth hanging on in an old man\u2019s mouth. T AM OW TR DES A. The club was established in 1920 and now has more than 200 members, with a core group of elderly people (membership \u00a335 per year). Loyal club member Brenda Shearing, who has been on the committee for 17 years, shows me round and says she hopes the club will \u201cgo on for ever\u201d. Clubs like this are closing down across the UK, and Murillo\u2019s intervention will, they hope, encourage a younger membership \u2013 people who want to commit time and TLC to the place. In a later phone call, Murillo talks about \u201clong-term commitment\u2026 I don\u2019t want Art Night simply to be a gesture\u201d. Helen Nisbet, artistic director of the event, suggests that his family and friends will bring \u201ca new conversation and culture\u201d to the place. And his family\u2019s membership money will contribute to the club\u2019s future. Visitors to Art Night can look forward to bingo, live music and a large dance floor. In the 70s and 80s, dancers used to queue round the block to get in. And on 22 June, Cathy, one of the club\u2019s oldest members, will celebrate her 90th birthday here, with a line-up of crooners. She has been informed about Murillo\u2019s performance \u2013 she was offered the option to celebrate her birthday on another night, but is staying put. Besides, Murillo will not disturb her, as he is to perform outside. His inspiration will be the 1987 Proclaimers song Letter from America (sung a cappella). I spent the evening thinking about All the blood that flowed away Across the ocean to the second chance I wonder how it got on When it reached the promised land? These powerful lyrics are about people affected by the destruction of industry in the Scottish lowlands in the 1980s, and look back to the 18th-and 19th-century Highland Clearances. There is no puzzle about why they should speak to Murillo or to any migrant who has ever searched for a promised land. In 2016, Murillo famously tore up his British passport (he also had a Colombian one) and flushed it down the toilet of a plane en route to Sydney (he was detained in Sydney, deported to Singapore, eventually returned to Britain). And there is no mistaking his vitriol when he says he wishes to \u201chold a mirror up to this country, which is culpable of waves of migration \u2013 including the Irish and Scots leaving their homelands because of persecution and having to go to America. There is still a notion that western society somehow occupies a higher moral ground. The discussion about ethnicity needs to be reversed.\u201d The Trades Hall has further concentrated Murillo\u2019s mind on what he describes as \u201cthe tragic hypocrisy of the British people \u2026This country has no concern for the working people. It happens in the context of art too. You can talk about race all you like, and yet there is no comparable conversation about class. Yet class touches the core \u2013 it is a raw wound. You have people who live below the poverty line on this island.\u201d The outrage in Murillo is tangled up in melancholy. In a leaflet accompanying the Kettle\u2019s Yard show, he remembers taking a bullet train in Tokyo, in 2017, and encountering a Japanese phrase, \u201cMono no aware\u201d, which translates as \u201cthe pathos of things\u201d. He has suggested that this inspired some of the work in his show. Yet the last thing he tells me \u2013 offered as an over-arching thought \u2013 is more about people than things. He says what concerns him most, in all his work, is \u201cthe loss of humanity within our society, whether in my family or other communities\u201d. And you can hear, even in his tone of voice, that for Murillo, lamentation is always on the edge of revolt. \u2022 Art Night is on 22 June in Walthamstow and King\u2019s Cross, London. Oscar Murillo: Violent Amnesia is at Kettle\u2019s Yard, Cambridge, until 23 June; Manifestation is at David Zwirner, London W1, until 26 July Art Night 2019: other highlights Transforming car parks, malls, a market and more, the fourth edition of Art Night comprises more than 50 projects taking place on 22 June in Walthamstow and King\u2019s Cross. Alongside Murillo\u2019s work, highlights include: The first outdoor commission in the UK for over 15 years by veteran US artist Barbara Kruger. The large-scale work, Untitled (look like us, talk like us, think like us, pray like us, love like us), will be in Walthamstow Town Square. New Yorker Cory Arcangel (who studied classical guitar before turning to art) collaborates with organist Hampus Lindwall for They told me there would be tea in which leading artists have composed new music for the organ of St Mary\u2019s church, Walthamstow. Meanwhile, in the more workaday venue of Sainsbury\u2019s car park, Joe Namy will create a sound installation using cars (The Eighth Automobile) and, along Walthamstow market, British duo Hannah Quinlan and Rosie Hastings will present a musical spectacle exploring gay culture. In King\u2019s Cross, Marina Abramovic fans should seek out the UK premiere of her first virtual reality piece, Rising, while Coal Drops Yard will host US sound artist Christine Sun Kim, who has collaborated with students at Frank Barnes School for Deaf Children for We Mean Business, a three-part commission exploring deafness.

But some cooks are unconvinced by assurances from the force\u2019s knife-crime strategy manager, Supt Matt McFarlane, that the utensils won\u2019t compromise standards of food preparation. Has he really considered knife skills, in the round?</p> <p>The last time a similar innovation was proposed, rather persuasively, by three doctors in the <em>BMJ</em>, the late chef Anthony Bourdain considered it \u201canother sign of the coming apocalypse\u201d. And that <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/330/7502/1221?sort_by=field_highwire_a_epubdate_value&amp;sort_order=DESC&amp;items_per_page=10&amp;page=1&amp;panels_ajax_tab_tab=bmj_related_rapid_responses&amp;panels_ajax_tab_trigger=rapid-responses\" title=\"\">roundly derided scheme</a> was devised not with domestic stabbing in mind, but with armed young men with neither an obvious interest in, nor much opportunity for, home cooking. Isn\u2019t that reason enough to rethink a plan that encourages women to cohabit with psychopaths whose suspicions, thanks to a new blunt knife, they may have alerted? Isn\u2019t there a better case for free stab vests, for wear during cooking and whenever a known assailant might be around, in or out of the house? You can\u2019t be too careful. As the Nottingham police and crime commissioner, one Paddy Tipping, said last week of the blunt knives project: \u201cIt is an excellent initiative.

      "bodyText": "Nottinghamshire police have been defending a new scheme to distribute blunt-ended knives to victims of domestic abuse. But some cooks are unconvinced by assurances from the force\u2019s knife-crime strategy manager, Supt Matt McFarlane, that the utensils won\u2019t compromise standards of food preparation. Has he really considered knife skills, in the round? The last time a similar innovation was proposed, rather persuasively, by three doctors in the BMJ, the late chef Anthony Bourdain considered it \u201canother sign of the coming apocalypse\u201d. And that roundly derided scheme was devised not with domestic stabbing in mind, but with armed young men with neither an obvious interest in, nor much opportunity for, home cooking. Isn\u2019t that reason enough to rethink a plan that encourages women to cohabit with psychopaths whose suspicions, thanks to a new blunt knife, they may have alerted? Isn\u2019t there a better case for free stab vests, for wear during cooking and whenever a known assailant might be around, in or out of the house? You can\u2019t be too careful. As the Nottingham police and crime commissioner, one Paddy Tipping, said last week of the blunt knives project: \u201cIt is an excellent initiative. Some research shows that women are attacked around 19 times before they leave their home.\u201d Assuming his force can justify the threat to domestic carving, there remains the possibility that blunt knives might not offer victims as much protection as, for instance, the containment of domestic aggression following one or two, instead of 19 attacks. True, sharp instruments are used, to judge by one report, in 47.4% of murders of women. But an investigation by Vice into murder cases where the killers had already been reported by partners suggests, given the range of weaponry, that police might find utensil-based crime prevention even more of a struggle than supporting victims.

Kerri McAuley, 32, was punched to death in 2017 by Joe Storey, who had 11 previous convictions for offences against women and two earlier restraining orders prior to one supposed to be protecting McAuley. Jane Clough, 26, was murdered in 2010 with a penknife \u2013 a 3in Leatherman multi-tool \u2013 by her ex-partner and the father of her child, Jonathan Vass. The killer brought it with him when he lay in wait in the car park of a hospital where Clough was a nurse in A&amp;E. He was bailed and awaiting trial at the time, following her report of rape. Shania Grice, 19, was fined \u00a390 for wasting police time before, in 2016, Michael Lane, the ex-partner she had repeatedly reported for stalking, slit her throat \u2013 rather than stabbing her \u2013 with a knife.

Many opponents had slammed the cuts as a corporate giveaway that benefited the super-rich. But big firms lobbied for it, saying \u2013 as AT&amp;T did \u2013 that it would fund job-creating expansions.</p> <p>The bill was voted into law in December 2017, <a href=\"https://www.thebalance.com/trump-s-tax-plan-how-it-affects-you-4113968\">reducing</a> the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. AT&amp;T\u2019s benefit was a <a href=\"https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/att-cut-over-23000-jobs-congress-passed-tax-bill\">tax windfall of $21</a><a href=\"https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/att-cut-over-23000-jobs-congress-passed-tax-bill\">bn</a> and an additional estimated $3bn annually. But instead of creating jobs and increasing investment into the company, AT&amp;T has <a href=\"https://cwa-union.org/sites/default/files/20190508-cwa-att-jobs-report-update.pdf\">eliminated 23,328 jobs</a> since the tax cut bill was passed, according to a recent report by the Communications Workers of America. The CWA also said AT&amp;T <a href=\"https://district9.cwa-union.org/news/releases/despite-promises-att-announces-california-layoffs\">reduced </a>their capital investments by $1.4bn.</p> <p>\u201cThe promises that were made from that legislation have not been fulfilled,\u201d said Betsy Lafontaine, an AT&amp;T call center employee in Appleton, Wisconsin, for nearly 30 years who was laid off after her center was shut down in March 2019.</p> <p>An AT&amp;T representative told the Guardian: \u201cWe continue to hire in areas where we\u2019re seeing increasing demand for products and services, but technology is changing rapidly and that affects hiring and employment.

      "bodyText": "Stephen Smith worked at an AT&amp;T call center in Meriden, Connecticut, for over 20 years before the giant telecoms company announced it was closing the city\u2019s three call centers in February 2019. \u201cAt 46 years old, I\u2019m looking for a new job,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThey basically told us we either need to move south or lose our job. It was out of the blue. We had no idea.\u201d Smith and about 90 of his colleagues were offered severance packages or the option to relocate to Georgia or Tennessee. But for most workers who have spouses with their own careers, elderly parents nearby in need of care, or children still in school, relocating on a whim isn\u2019t an option. These sudden mass layoffs have become increasingly common for workers at AT&amp;T and many other big firms. But it was not meant to be that way. AT&amp;T\u2019s CEO, Randall Stephenson, promised in November 2017 to invest $1bn in capital expenditure and create 7,000 new jobs at the company if Trump\u2019s hugely controversial tax cut bill passed. Many opponents had slammed the cuts as a corporate giveaway that benefited the super-rich. But big firms lobbied for it, saying \u2013 as AT&amp;T did \u2013 that it would fund job-creating expansions. The bill was voted into law in December 2017, reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. AT&amp;T\u2019s benefit was a tax windfall of $21bn and an additional estimated $3bn annually. But instead of creating jobs and increasing investment into the company, AT&amp;T has eliminated 23,328 jobs since the tax cut bill was passed, according to a recent report by the Communications Workers of America. The CWA also said AT&amp;T reduced their capital investments by $1.4bn. \u201cThe promises that were made from that legislation have not been fulfilled,\u201d said Betsy Lafontaine, an AT&amp;T call center employee in Appleton, Wisconsin, for nearly 30 years who was laid off after her center was shut down in March 2019. An AT&amp;T representative told the Guardian: \u201cWe continue to hire in areas where we\u2019re seeing increasing demand for products and services, but technology is changing rapidly and that affects hiring and employment. There are fewer jobs in parts of the business that are declining and facing technology shifts.\u201d AT&amp;T is among several large corporations whose CEOs announced support of the Trump tax cut bill by claiming if the legislation passed, their companies would ensure workers reaped benefits from it. But a report published on 22 May by the Congressional Research Service, a non-partisan thinktank for members of Congress, found the tax cuts did not significantly affect the economy or boost wages, but benefited investors more than anyone else. \u201cThe evidence continues to mount that the Trump-GOP tax cuts were a scam, a giant bait-and-switch that promised workers big pay raises, a lot more jobs and new investments, but they largely enriched CEOs and the already wealthy,\u201d said Frank Clemente, executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness. He noted only 4% of the US workforce saw any sort of pay increase or bonus from the tax cuts. Meanwhile, data collected by ATF shows corporations have cut thousands of jobs since the tax cuts were passed, while using tax windfalls to buy back $1tn of their own stock, which primarily benefits corporate executives and wealthy investors since half of all Americans own no stock. General Motors\u2019 CEO, Mary Barra, was one of Trump\u2019s economic advisers on tax reform, and the company vocally supported working with the Trump administration on tax reform \u201cthat is beneficial to the US economy, beneficial to US manufacturing and creates jobs\u201d. In November 2018, GM announced it would cease operations at five plants in Michigan, Ohio, Maryland and Ontario, Canada, resulting in the loss of more than 14,000 jobs in those communities. As GM is closing plants, the company has spent $10bn since 2015 on stock buybacks, and made a net profit of over $8bn despite paying no federal taxes in 2018. GM reported a tax windfall of $157m in the first three months of 2018 due to the Trump tax cut. Daniel Adams worked at the General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio, for more than 25 years and is one of hundreds of workers faced with either being forced to uproot and relocate their families to continue employment at GM, or hope the company will cut a deal with the UAW union to reopen the plant. \u201cIt\u2019s like having a gun to your head,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThey\u2019re not only hurting workers, they\u2019re hurting families.\u201d A GM representative said: \u201cIn November, we announced that four US plants would be on \u2018unallocated status\u2019 (meaning they don\u2019t have a product assigned to them). The largest of the affected plants was our Lordstown Complex, which built compact sedans. We took the action because consumer demand has been rapidly shifting away from sedans and toward crossovers and trucks.\u201d Wells Fargo, the fourth largest bank in the US by assets, tied a minimum wage increase of $15 an hour to the Trump tax cuts and pledged increased investments in workers. The company is estimated to save $3.7bn annually due to the Trump tax cut. The bank\u2019s 2018 tax savings were 47 times more than the costs of its minimum wage increases. Rather than invest in its workforce, Wells Fargo bought back 350m shares in early 2018, worth about $22.6bn, increased CEO salary by 36%, and announced plans in September 2018 to eliminate at least 26,000 jobs in the US over the next three years as many of those positions are being sent overseas. \u201cNobody here saw any of that benefit; if anything, quite the opposite. They changed our healthcare plans in 2019, so the costs for everyone went up, the costs for prescriptions went up,\u201d said Mark Willie, a Wells Fargo office employee in Des Moines, Iowa. \u201cWe need a voice because we\u2019re often forgotten about in pursuit of profits, and that\u2019s evident with the jobs being sent overseas.\u201d Wells Fargo said: \u201cSavings from tax reform enabled Wells Fargo to further invest in our team members and communities.

Measures would also be taken to cut back the number of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/03/venetians-renew-calls-for-cruise-ships-to-be-banned-after-crash\" title=\"\">cruise ships</a> able to dock at nearby Zeebrugge from five a day to just two. Cruise companies will also be asked to dock during the week rather than at weekends to help spread the crowds.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to control the influx more if we don\u2019t want Bruges to become a complete Disneyland here,\u201d De fauw told the Flemish TV channel VRT in a news item that was picked up by media outlets around the world.</p> <p>Bruges is visited by 8.3 million people a year, up 28% in the last two years, and yet just 2.5 million of those spend a night. Too few of those filling the cobbled streets and sun-dappled squares are spending money when they come, instead being shipped in and shipped out within hours of arrival, but also breaking the calm serenity of the city, De fauw said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9e7eb30c33a5800fc70515da6a11c2878efb3dc9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e7eb30c33a5800fc70515da6a11c2878efb3dc9/13_118_2413_3017/800.jpg\" alt=\"Dirk De fauw, mayor of Bruges: \u2018The inhabitants of Bruges don\u2019t recognise their own city.\u2019\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dirk De fauw, mayor of Bruges: \u2018The inhabitants of Bruges don\u2019t recognise their own city.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Boffey/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tourists recognise that there is a problem. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying it but there are too many people,\u201d said Eli Sabbair, 36, from Iran, standing under Bruges\u2019s belfry tower. But Jonckheere, along with his brother Daniel, who inherited the shop on Katelijnestraat in 1990 from their parents, Joseph and Lucette, greeted the news with understandable dismay.</p> <p>Not everyone was pleased when the Jonckheere brothers switched from selling poultry to flogging Bruges-branded merchandise and Belgian beers to tourists. But travellers outnumber residents in Bruges city centre by about three to one.</p> <p>\u201cAnd it is much harder work to sell chicken \u2013 a lot more controls,\u201d said Jonckheere. \u201cThe younger people all buy their food from the big supermarkets anyway, Carrefour and Delhaize. That is how it is now. A lot of people in this city live off tourism. OK, not everyone spends money when they come, but many do.\u201d</p> <p>Daniel, who is president of the local retailers\u2019 association, will make his feelings clear to the mayor at a meeting over the coming weeks.</p> <p>Under the shade of the sycamores by the city\u2019s monastery, Nick Notre Dame, 39, was tending to his horse and carriage as he waited for customers. \u201cYou can never have enough tourists,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the mayor has got this wrong. But it is true that not enough people stay for very long. The groups move through very fast, they have no time to do anything, and they all have a budget \u2013 and they don\u2019t go over it.\u201d</p> <p>The grumblings of some of the 120,000 who live in Bruges have not gone unnoticed by De fauw, who was born and bred in the city \u2013 a place, he said, that was generally at ease with itself. Highly affluent, with unemployment no higher than 5%, Bruges broke with the rest of Flanders in last year\u2019s elections by choosing De fauw, a candidate with a liberal approach to migration, rather than the strident approach championed by the far-right nationalist Vlaams Belang party, which made substabtial gains in the region.</p> <p>Over a coffee in a cafe on the Kraanplein, the city\u2019s <em>burgemeester</em> explained that his move was in keeping with a series of decisions that had allowed Bruges to maintain its attraction to locals and visitors alike.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ef38fbe74db5dc565bebbb2a69a6b390a816e29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ef38fbe74db5dc565bebbb2a69a6b390a816e29/400_715_3202_1921/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Another of Bruges\u2019s big attractions: Belgian beer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Another of Bruges\u2019s big attractions: Belgian beer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arterra/Universal Images Group via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere are 13 central cities in Flanders,\u201d said De fauw. \u201cBruges is the third biggest behind Antwerp and Ghent. And for something like 12 or 14 years we have come top when the people were asked in a survey whether they are proud of their city. It is said that 90% are proud of their city \u2013 and we want to keep it like this.\u201d</p> <p>In 1996 there was a ban on building new hotels in the city centre, and in 2002 there was a prohibition on holiday homes.</p> <p>\u201cNow we are looking at the areas outside the city centre \u2013 such as Sint Andries \u2013 to see if we need to do the same there on holiday homes. Otherwise we will end up with no one living in Bruges.

      "bodyText": "There is a distinctly military pace to the ant-like line of tourists that streams out every morning from Bruges\u2019s sprawling art-deco railway station and the nearby coach park. Clutching phones or maps, and with backpacks firmly strapped on, they swarm with purpose in the direction of the Flemish city\u2019s cathedral, the spire of which is just visible over the top of the sycamore and oak trees that act as a break between the modern suburbs and transport hubs and one of the world\u2019s best-preserved medieval centres. But watching the tourists pass by his souvenir shop on the way to the sites this weekend, 61-year-old Paul Jonckheere was struggling to maintain his naturally cheerful demeanour. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect this \u2013 why would the mayor do it?\u201d Jonckheere asked. \u201cI can\u2019t understand this at all.\u201d The city of Bruges, a Unesco world heritage site, last week became just the latest stop on the global tourist trail to question the philosophy that more is better when it comes to visitors. Last week the mayor, Dirk De fauw, elected in October under the slogan \u201cGo with De fauw\u201d, announced that the municipality would no longer advertise or promote day trips to the city. Measures would also be taken to cut back the number of cruise ships able to dock at nearby Zeebrugge from five a day to just two. Cruise companies will also be asked to dock during the week rather than at weekends to help spread the crowds. \u201cWe have to control the influx more if we don\u2019t want Bruges to become a complete Disneyland here,\u201d De fauw told the Flemish TV channel VRT in a news item that was picked up by media outlets around the world. Bruges is visited by 8.3 million people a year, up 28% in the last two years, and yet just 2.5 million of those spend a night. Too few of those filling the cobbled streets and sun-dappled squares are spending money when they come, instead being shipped in and shipped out within hours of arrival, but also breaking the calm serenity of the city, De fauw said. Tourists recognise that there is a problem. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying it but there are too many people,\u201d said Eli Sabbair, 36, from Iran, standing under Bruges\u2019s belfry tower. But Jonckheere, along with his brother Daniel, who inherited the shop on Katelijnestraat in 1990 from their parents, Joseph and Lucette, greeted the news with understandable dismay. Not everyone was pleased when the Jonckheere brothers switched from selling poultry to flogging Bruges-branded merchandise and Belgian beers to tourists. But travellers outnumber residents in Bruges city centre by about three to one. \u201cAnd it is much harder work to sell chicken \u2013 a lot more controls,\u201d said Jonckheere. \u201cThe younger people all buy their food from the big supermarkets anyway, Carrefour and Delhaize. That is how it is now. A lot of people in this city live off tourism. OK, not everyone spends money when they come, but many do.\u201d Daniel, who is president of the local retailers\u2019 association, will make his feelings clear to the mayor at a meeting over the coming weeks. Under the shade of the sycamores by the city\u2019s monastery, Nick Notre Dame, 39, was tending to his horse and carriage as he waited for customers. \u201cYou can never have enough tourists,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the mayor has got this wrong. But it is true that not enough people stay for very long. The groups move through very fast, they have no time to do anything, and they all have a budget \u2013 and they don\u2019t go over it.\u201d The grumblings of some of the 120,000 who live in Bruges have not gone unnoticed by De fauw, who was born and bred in the city \u2013 a place, he said, that was generally at ease with itself. Highly affluent, with unemployment no higher than 5%, Bruges broke with the rest of Flanders in last year\u2019s elections by choosing De fauw, a candidate with a liberal approach to migration, rather than the strident approach championed by the far-right nationalist Vlaams Belang party, which made substabtial gains in the region. Over a coffee in a cafe on the Kraanplein, the city\u2019s burgemeester explained that his move was in keeping with a series of decisions that had allowed Bruges to maintain its attraction to locals and visitors alike. \u201cThere are 13 central cities in Flanders,\u201d said De fauw. \u201cBruges is the third biggest behind Antwerp and Ghent. And for something like 12 or 14 years we have come top when the people were asked in a survey whether they are proud of their city. It is said that 90% are proud of their city \u2013 and we want to keep it like this.\u201d In 1996 there was a ban on building new hotels in the city centre, and in 2002 there was a prohibition on holiday homes. \u201cNow we are looking at the areas outside the city centre \u2013 such as Sint Andries \u2013 to see if we need to do the same there on holiday homes. Otherwise we will end up with no one living in Bruges. We are not like Amsterdam yet \u2013 and we will provide to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d \u201cWe want the people who stay in our hotels, who go to restaurants, who buy something in the shops, but we will not promote for those tourists who just come a few hours to Bruges,\u201d De fauw added. \u201cThey have a quick walk around Bruges, they walk as quickly as possible, they do not buy anything and they go back to the bus, and go back to the hotel for a meal, in Antwerp, Brussels or Ghent.\u201d \u201cWhen you come to the city it must be a little bit slowly, you don\u2019t have to hurry up and spend three hours with a guide. They don\u2019t have the time to sit on a terrace and have a tea or beer \u2013 no, they have no time. They are disturbing a little bit the charming character of our city.\u201d De fauw said he was concerned about the shops in his city since he had noticed via his own children how online purchasing was becoming the norm. \u201cMy son bought three jackets and I asked why he needed three jackets, but he was just going to send two back once he had tried them on,\u201d De Fauw said. \u201cI want to help the shops too. \u201cWhen you have tourists who don\u2019t stay a long time they go to just one part of the city, and the shops there are fixed on tourists. So what do they sell? Chocolate and beer. The inhabitants of Bruges don\u2019t recognise their own city. They see no clothes shops, butchers, bakers.

In the 2008 black comedy film In Bruges, Colin Farrell\u2019s hitman character is driven mad by the picture-book perfection and gentleness of the city. \u201cAn important part of that film was at night,\u201d De fauw said. \u201cThat is when the city is at its most beautiful, when it is so calm and you can walk along the canals, and it so quiet you can even hear doors opening. That\u2019s what I want everyone to enjoy.\u201d",

Suffolk County Council \u2013 the area in which health secretary Matt Hancock is an MP \u2013 plans to cut as many as 31 full-time posts from its 120-strong health visitor workforce, through a combination of redundancies and not filling vacancies, despite the team\u2019s key role in family health. Internal council documents seen by the Observer show that the Conservative-controlled authority intends to push through the controversial plan by September in order to save \u00a31m from its health visiting, school nursing and family nurse partnership services. The council is being forced to change the way it provides health services for children and young people because the public health grant it receives from central government has been slashed by \u00a35.47m (16.7%) since 2015/16. The council wants to drastically reduce the role of health visitors so they no longer undertake three of the five checks of mother-and-baby health that all should receive by the time the infant is two-and-a-half years old. In future they will focus on the most vulnerable families \u2013 with nurses, who health visitors say have not had the same training, taking on the other three checks. Health visitors help parents tackle childhood obesity, prepare for their baby to have its childhood vaccinations and ensure that infants bond with their mother and father in the crucial early months. The proposal has triggered a backlash. Local Conservative MPs are warning that \u201cdismantling\u201d Suffolk\u2019s health visiting service will reduce the advice and support that parents receive to help them negotiate the challenges of having a baby. MPs including Jo Churchill and Dr Dan Poulter intend to question council leader Matthew Hicks about the plans at a meeting on 5 July. The documents reveal that north-east Ipswich and coastal Suffolk are due to lose 14 full-time equivalent health visitor posts, and south and west Ipswich 7 posts, because the council has decided to cut the budget of its 0-19 Healthy Child Service by 10%, which is about \u00a31m. Poulter, who served as a health minister in the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, said: \u201cHaving worked hard as a health minister to personally oversee the rebuilding of the health visitor workforce, and increase health visitor numbers by over 4,000 between 2012 and 2015, it is disappointing to see councils like Suffolk dismantling a service that is so important to new families.\u201d The Local Government Association, which represents councils in England and Wales, recently warned that health visitor numbers had fallen so much since 2015 \u2013 to about 8,000 \u2013 that services for \u201cour youngest generation\u201d were at risk. Retirements, health visitors leaving to do other jobs and a lack of new recruits meant the residual workforce was \u201cbeing stretched to its limits\u201d, it said. Year-on-year Whitehall cuts to public health budgets is leading to councils reducing sexual health and drug and alcohol addiction services, Poulter added. \u201cSadly, it looks as though health visiting services and the families they care for are now also suffering.\u201d He urged ministers to amend the Health and Social Care Act 2012 so that the NHS regains responsibility for public health. One Suffolk health visitor said: \u201cWe\u2019re all feeling very angry and very demoralised by the council\u2019s decision. We all support each other in our work but are now being put in competition with each other for jobs, because we\u2019re all having to reapply for our existing jobs. \u201cIt\u2019s short-sighted to cut health visitor numbers because if a mum who needs health advice about her baby can\u2019t see us she\u2019ll go to her GP or A&amp;E, both of which are already very busy.

A spokesperson added: \u201cDue to reductions in public health grants and other cost pressures, we have had to make adjustments to the care and support we provide, and often these have proved to be difficult decisions. \u201cHowever, we believe with the new service, and by working collaboratively, we will be able to provide the very best care and support that our children and young people deserve.\u201d",

Is this the death of sex in cinema?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It said that a new summer pattern has emerged: the release of several European-produced festival and arthouse films \u2013 often, like this year\u2019s French drama <em>Mektoub, My Love: Intermezzo</em><em>,</em> heavy with action \u2013 followed by a season of sexless Hollywood action and family films.</p> <p>Lost between those two options is the classic sex scene. So no more <em>Don\u2019t Look Now</em> with Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland; no <em>9<strong>\u00bd</strong> Weeks</em> with Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke; no <em>Dangerous Liaisons</em>, <em>The Postman Always Rings Twice</em> or <em>Mulholland Drive</em><em> </em>... the list goes on.</p> <p>\u201cOnce a staple of high-gloss, adult-oriented, mainstream movies,\u201d the <em>Washington Post</em> wrote, the sex scene \u201chas been largely forgotten and ignored, recommitted to the very esoteric margins it sprang from generations ago\u201d.</p> <p>But why? According to academics and close observers of Hollywood culture, the reasons are multifarious, and suggest that the movie business is going through a profound realignment of priorities backed by broad cultural, political and legislative changes.</p> <p>According to Stephen Galloway, a columnist at the <em>Hollywood Reporter</em>, the changes are primarily economic: Hollywood is simply no longer in the business of making mid-budget character dramas that might or might not include physical bonding. Instead, movies must appeal to the \u201cfour quadrants\u201d \u2013 male and female, over and under the age of 25. \u201cWeirdly, it\u2019s not a new puritanism \u2013 Hollywood has always been puritanical. Its about economics,\u201d says Galloway. \u201cInclude sex and you\u2019ll get an \u2018R\u2019 rating, and that means no kids: that\u2019s not going to bring in a four-quadrant audience.\u201d</p> <p>The current exceptions, or at least aberrations, seem to be musical dramas involving homosexual love: witness the success of the Elton John coming-out-and-getting-famous drama <em>Rocketman</em>, or the Queen biopic <em>Bohemian Rhapsody</em>, which has reportedly produced a billion dollars in business for its producers, the group\u2019s drummer and guitar player.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"291638fcda027078bbea13ce04d668cf7c581c56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/291638fcda027078bbea13ce04d668cf7c581c56/0_0_1821_2760/660.jpg\" alt=\"Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger in 9\u00bd Weeks (1986).\" width=\"660\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger in 9\u00bd Weeks (1986).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/MGM/Sportsphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But no discussion of sex in the cinema in 2019 can take place without reference to #MeToo \u2013 the movement that has brought profound changes to what women can insist on in their contracts. \u201cWomen feel far less compelled to agree to nudity, and it\u2019s empowered them to say no,\u201d says Galloway. In the current environment, lawyers for actors are demanding more specific, iron-clad protections in \u201cnudity riders\u201d, including the ability to sue for leaked footage.</p> <p>Part of the change, again is economic. Female actors, if they\u2019re lucky, can pick up lucrative fashion and beauty endorsements, both of which demand careful image preparation and maintenance. Having your latest sex scene blasted across the internet is hardly an endorsement of sophistication.</p> <p>The changes, Galloway says, apply equally to television, where despite the greater freedom of content provided by Netflix and HBO, the classic sex scene is still something of a rarity.</p> <p>Where there are exceptions, they can be startling. The new drugs-and-sex teen drama <em>Euphoria</em> starring the former Disney star Zendaya is a case in point.</p> <p>According to reports last week, <em>Euphoria</em> includes graphic nudity (including 30 male exposures in one episode), violence (a statutory rape involving a 17-year-old trans girl) and sex scenes involving choking and drug use, including Zendaya\u2019s character herself overdosing.</p> <p>\u201cThere are going to be parents who are going to be totally fucking freaked out,\u201d <em>Euphoria\u2019s</em> creator, Sam Levinson, son of director Barry Levinson, <a href=\"https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2019/06/hbo-drake-produced-euphoria-parents-freaked-out\" title=\"\">told </a><em><a href=\"https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2019/06/hbo-drake-produced-euphoria-parents-freaked-out\" title=\"\">Variety</a></em><a href=\"https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2019/06/hbo-drake-produced-euphoria-parents-freaked-out\" title=\"\"> last week</a>.</p> <p>But, again, liberating 22-year-old Zendaya from her Disney-princess prison with a shocking coming-of-age series is not quite equivalent to the behaviour that female actors are now taking a harder stance against. From producers demanding unnecessary nudity to the allegations of routine \u201ccasting couch\u201d sexual abuse that are likely to be heard by a Manhattan jury when the producer Harvey Weinstein goes on trial in September, the mood in the movie business has shifted.</p> <p>Professor Linda Hirshman, author of <em>Reckoning</em> \u2013 a major new study of sexual abuse and harassment that traces the origins of the #MeToo movement to the death of Mary Jo Kopechne in Ted Kennedy\u2019s car at Chappaquiddick in 1969 \u2013 argues that the roots of the current anti-sex mood go back to the restoration of the British monarchy in 1660.</p> <p>It was then that women were first allowed to take the stage and treated almost by definition as being sexually available. Fast-forward 300 years, and Hollywood, Hirshman writes, \u201cwas like Restoration English theater on steroids\u201d. Or, as Marilyn Monroe once noted, the men she knew saw Hollywood as \u201can overcrowded brothel, a merry-go-round with beds for horses\u201d.</p> <p>But returning to the days before 1660 may not be what today\u2019s actresses have in mind. In her research for <em>Reckoning</em>, Hirshman says several actresses told her that, although they objected to being pressurised to appear nude, the fact of nudity itself was not the problem.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"09f0d9e937930457e2e066f382265a384b3c3b90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09f0d9e937930457e2e066f382265a384b3c3b90/278_0_5306_3184/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie in Don\u2019t Look Now (1973).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie in Don\u2019t Look Now (1973).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey complained bitterly about being abused by their male co-stars when they appeared in sex scenes prior to the #MeToo movement,\u201d Hirshman says. \u201cIn some cases, male co-stars took advantage during sex scenes, touching them where it wasn\u2019t necessary for the scene.\u201d</p> <p>Hirshman believes actresses could have sued years ago under America\u2019s 1964 Civil Rights Act on the grounds of being made to work in a hostile environment. \u201cOf course, it would have been the end of their careers, and of course they didn\u2019t want to sacrifice their ambitions.\u201d</p> <p>She believes the turning point came in 2016 with the Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson\u2019s sexual harassment lawsuit against the head of her network, Roger Ailes \u2013 a landmark case that helped dispel the stigma of bringing a lawsuit. The floodgates opened. But the political and legislative environment matters too: Hirshman points out that California has very advanced employment-equality laws.</p> <p>Female stars such as Reese Witherspoon and Meryl Streep have joined the effort for sexual-equality education, helping to turn the tide against harassment in an industry where career success and failure for aspiring actresses seems to turn on the unknowable machinations of producers, directors and agents, most of whom are male.</p> <p>Just maybe, then, the death of the contemporary sex scene has deeper roots for women in the acting profession than are readily obvious, Hirshman says. \u201cWe can speculate they might be exercising a scintilla of the new power that they now have and putting limits on their exposure to abuse.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>X-rated scenes</strong></h2> <p><strong>Secretary (2002)</strong><br>Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader portray BDSM roleplay </p> <p><strong>9</strong><strong>\u00bd Weeks (1986)</strong><br>Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger explore a brief but graphic and obsessive affair</p> <p><strong>The Piano Teacher (2001)</strong><br>Michael Haneke directs Isabelle Huppert and Beno\u00eet Magimel in an exploration of sado-masochism</p> <p><strong>Last Tango in Paris (1972)</strong><br>Marlon Brando\u2019s obsession with Maria Schneider becomes a test of sexual disassociation.</p> <p><strong>Don\u2019t Look Now (1973)</strong><br>Rumours circulated for years that Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie\u2019s frank sex scene was not simulated</p> <p><strong>Blue Is the Warmest Colour (2013)</strong><br>European in origin, the lesbian love story includes a seven-minute sex scene</p> <p><strong>American Psycho (2000)</strong><br>Mary Harron\u2019s brilliant but profoundly unfriendly take on male sexual sociopathology</p> <p><strong>The Outlaw (1943)</strong><br>Jane Russell hits the hay as the feisty Rio McDonald in the role that made her famous</p> <p><strong>Black Swan (2010)</strong><br>Darren Aronofsky\u2019s ballet melodrama features a fantasy lesbian scene with Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis</p>",

According to academics and close observers of Hollywood culture, the reasons are multifarious, and suggest that the movie business is going through a profound realignment of priorities backed by broad cultural, political and legislative changes. According to Stephen Galloway, a columnist at the Hollywood Reporter, the changes are primarily economic: Hollywood is simply no longer in the business of making mid-budget character dramas that might or might not include physical bonding. Instead, movies must appeal to the \u201cfour quadrants\u201d \u2013 male and female, over and under the age of 25. \u201cWeirdly, it\u2019s not a new puritanism \u2013 Hollywood has always been puritanical. Its about economics,\u201d says Galloway. \u201cInclude sex and you\u2019ll get an \u2018R\u2019 rating, and that means no kids: that\u2019s not going to bring in a four-quadrant audience.\u201d The current exceptions, or at least aberrations, seem to be musical dramas involving homosexual love: witness the success of the Elton John coming-out-and-getting-famous drama Rocketman, or the Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody, which has reportedly produced a billion dollars in business for its producers, the group\u2019s drummer and guitar player. But no discussion of sex in the cinema in 2019 can take place without reference to #MeToo \u2013 the movement that has brought profound changes to what women can insist on in their contracts. \u201cWomen feel far less compelled to agree to nudity, and it\u2019s empowered them to say no,\u201d says Galloway. In the current environment, lawyers for actors are demanding more specific, iron-clad protections in \u201cnudity riders\u201d, including the ability to sue for leaked footage. Part of the change, again is economic. Female actors, if they\u2019re lucky, can pick up lucrative fashion and beauty endorsements, both of which demand careful image preparation and maintenance. Having your latest sex scene blasted across the internet is hardly an endorsement of sophistication. The changes, Galloway says, apply equally to television, where despite the greater freedom of content provided by Netflix and HBO, the classic sex scene is still something of a rarity. Where there are exceptions, they can be startling. The new drugs-and-sex teen drama Euphoria starring the former Disney star Zendaya is a case in point. According to reports last week, Euphoria includes graphic nudity (including 30 male exposures in one episode), violence (a statutory rape involving a 17-year-old trans girl) and sex scenes involving choking and drug use, including Zendaya\u2019s character herself overdosing. \u201cThere are going to be parents who are going to be totally fucking freaked out,\u201d Euphoria\u2019s creator, Sam Levinson, son of director Barry Levinson, told Variety last week. But, again, liberating 22-year-old Zendaya from her Disney-princess prison with a shocking coming-of-age series is not quite equivalent to the behaviour that female actors are now taking a harder stance against. From producers demanding unnecessary nudity to the allegations of routine \u201ccasting couch\u201d sexual abuse that are likely to be heard by a Manhattan jury when the producer Harvey Weinstein goes on trial in September, the mood in the movie business has shifted. Professor Linda Hirshman, author of Reckoning \u2013 a major new study of sexual abuse and harassment that traces the origins of the #MeToo movement to the death of Mary Jo Kopechne in Ted Kennedy\u2019s car at Chappaquiddick in 1969 \u2013 argues that the roots of the current anti-sex mood go back to the restoration of the British monarchy in 1660. It was then that women were first allowed to take the stage and treated almost by definition as being sexually available. Fast-forward 300 years, and Hollywood, Hirshman writes, \u201cwas like Restoration English theater on steroids\u201d. Or, as Marilyn Monroe once noted, the men she knew saw Hollywood as \u201can overcrowded brothel, a merry-go-round with beds for horses\u201d. But returning to the days before 1660 may not be what today\u2019s actresses have in mind. In her research for Reckoning, Hirshman says several actresses told her that, although they objected to being pressurised to appear nude, the fact of nudity itself was not the problem. \u201cThey complained bitterly about being abused by their male co-stars when they appeared in sex scenes prior to the #MeToo movement,\u201d Hirshman says. \u201cIn some cases, male co-stars took advantage during sex scenes, touching them where it wasn\u2019t necessary for the scene.\u201d Hirshman believes actresses could have sued years ago under America\u2019s 1964 Civil Rights Act on the grounds of being made to work in a hostile environment. \u201cOf course, it would have been the end of their careers, and of course they didn\u2019t want to sacrifice their ambitions.\u201d She believes the turning point came in 2016 with the Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson\u2019s sexual harassment lawsuit against the head of her network, Roger Ailes \u2013 a landmark case that helped dispel the stigma of bringing a lawsuit. The floodgates opened. But the political and legislative environment matters too: Hirshman points out that California has very advanced employment-equality laws. Female stars such as Reese Witherspoon and Meryl Streep have joined the effort for sexual-equality education, helping to turn the tide against harassment in an industry where career success and failure for aspiring actresses seems to turn on the unknowable machinations of producers, directors and agents, most of whom are male. Just maybe, then, the death of the contemporary sex scene has deeper roots for women in the acting profession than are readily obvious, Hirshman says. \u201cWe can speculate they might be exercising a scintilla of the new power that they now have and putting limits on their exposure to abuse.\u201d X-rated scenes Secretary (2002) Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader portray BDSM roleplay 9\u00bd Weeks (1986) Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger explore a brief but graphic and obsessive affair The Piano Teacher (2001) Michael Haneke directs Isabelle Huppert and Beno\u00eet Magimel in an exploration of sado-masochism Last Tango in Paris (1972) Marlon Brando\u2019s obsession with Maria Schneider becomes a test of sexual disassociation.

Another is that governments were so dazzled by the technology \u2013 and so paralysed by neoliberal notions of the alleged inadequacy of the state \u2013 that they just let the creative destruction rip. But the biggest problem of all was that we collectively took tech companies at their own valuation. The people who founded these outfits all maintained that they were not like the evil capitalists of old. They were cool, young, idealistic, smart and never, ever wore suits. They supported the Democrats and had mantras such as \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d in their filings to regulators. What we omitted to notice was that the companies they founded were just corporations. And once they went public they did what corporations do: maximise shareholder value, come what may, avoid regulation and pay as little tax as possible. Just like tobacco companies and arms manufacturers, in fact. It has taken a long time for these pennies to drop, but better late than never.

He was dropped a second time by a violent combination in the last round, seemingly unconscious on descent, before somehow making it to his feet and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/dec/02/tyson-fury-wbc-heavyweight-boxing-deontay-wilder-split-draw\">settling for a split draw</a>. Although Fury failed in his bid to regain the world heavyweight championship he\u2019d won from Wladimir Klitschko but never lost in the ring, the career-best performance sent his stock through the roof. Indeed, Fury signed a money-spinning contract with Top Rank and ESPN on the heels of it.</p> <p>That partnership begins tonight with what can only be accurately described as a marking-time fight. Schwarz, a German who is somehow ranked No 2 by the World Boxing Organization despite being unknown to all but the most hardcore observers until the match was announced in April, looks the part at a strapping 6ft 5in, undefeated in 24 fights including 16 victories inside the distance. But the ledger is, shall we say, light on recognizable names and includes only one 10-rounder, a unanimous decision over the ordinary Dennis Lewandowski three years ago. He was a 12-1 longshot at the MGM Grand sports book when I arrived on Thursday and the number has drifted to 15-1 in the days since.</p> <p>In short, Fury is expected to win and look good doing it.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d054b538f08374cc578ed19\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-15T19:48:28.070Z\">8.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Bryan will be here shortly. </strong>In the meantime <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/14/tyson-fury-vegas-heavyweight-tom-schwarz-boxing\">here\u2019s his lookahead</a> to tonight\u2019s main event.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/14/tyson-fury-vegas-heavyweight-tom-schwarz-boxing\">Tyson Fury enjoys Vegas sparkle in reanimated heavyweight division</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div>",

If I had both my hands, I believe it would\u2019ve went differently.\u201d Next up: Tyson Fury v Tom Schwarz. We\u2019ve got a spicy one cooking between Jesse Hart and Sullivan Barrera. We\u2019re halfway through the scheduled 10-round light heavyweight affair, the last of the undercard bouts ahead of tonight\u2019s main event, and both guys have been in trouble at different points. Mikaela Mayer has just won a 10-round unanimous decision over Lizbeth Crespo by scores of 98-92, 99-91 and 100-90. The US Olympian was in total command from the third round on, improving her record to 11 wins in as many pro fights. \u201cI am ready for a world title fight next,\u201d Mayer said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the champions to step up and get in the ring with me.\u201d She adds: \u201cCrespo was a tough challenge, but I got through it and am ready to move on to bigger things.\u201d In case you missed it ... Josh Warrington defended his IBF featherweight title for a second time with a split-decision win over Kid Galahad in Leeds a few hours ago. Upset alert! We\u2019ve just had an surprise on the undercard as Albert Bell handed super featherweight contender Andy Vences his first professional defeat in an entertaining 10-round super featherweight scrap. Bell (15-0, 5 KOs) outthrew and outlanded his opponent from start to finish, winning by 97-93 on all three judges\u2019 scorecards. \u201cI worked so hard for this,\u201d Bell said afterward. \u201cIn my first 10-rounder, I went out there and put my undefeated record on the line against a top guy. You don\u2019t see that too much anymore. I\u2019ve been counted out and this shows that I\u2019m a fighter to be taken seriously at 130 pounds.\u201d Said a disappointed Vences (22-1-1, 12 KOs): \u201cI fought someone who didn\u2019t want to fight. I was looking for the action the whole fight, pressuring him. I thought that I hurt him and connected on the bigger punches. This is the hurt business.\u201d Earlier, Fury\u2019s friend and teammate Isaac Lowe bolstered his credentials as a featherweight prospect with unanimous-decision win over Duarn Vue. Mikaela Mayer, who represented the US at the Rio Olympics, is in the ring now for a 10-round super featherweight bout against Lizbeth Crespo. One more 10-rounder between light heavyweights Jesse Hart and Sullivan Barrera will follow, then Fury and Schwarz will make their ringwalks. Hello and welcome to the MGM Grand Garden Arena for tonight\u2019s heavyweight clash between Tyson Fury and Tom Schwarz. When last we saw the Gypsy King, he\u2019d just spent most of a December evening boxing the ears off Deontay Wilder, frustrating the WBC heavyweight champion with an effective jab and deft movement, even surviving a ninth-round knockdown to roar back in the final reel. He was dropped a second time by a violent combination in the last round, seemingly unconscious on descent, before somehow making it to his feet and settling for a split draw. Although Fury failed in his bid to regain the world heavyweight championship he\u2019d won from Wladimir Klitschko but never lost in the ring, the career-best performance sent his stock through the roof. Indeed, Fury signed a money-spinning contract with Top Rank and ESPN on the heels of it. That partnership begins tonight with what can only be accurately described as a marking-time fight. Schwarz, a German who is somehow ranked No 2 by the World Boxing Organization despite being unknown to all but the most hardcore observers until the match was announced in April, looks the part at a strapping 6ft 5in, undefeated in 24 fights including 16 victories inside the distance. But the ledger is, shall we say, light on recognizable names and includes only one 10-rounder, a unanimous decision over the ordinary Dennis Lewandowski three years ago. He was a 12-1 longshot at the MGM Grand sports book when I arrived on Thursday and the number has drifted to 15-1 in the days since. In short, Fury is expected to win and look good doing it. Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime here\u2019s his lookahead to tonight\u2019s main event.",

I can appreciate thoroughbred thinness in super-high-cocoa chocolate, as anyone who has tried to wrestle a segment from a 70% plus bar will testify: you want it to snap easily. But who can resist the shameless confidence of chunky chocolate?</p> <p>I was particularly excited by the newish <a href=\"https://tonyschocolonely.com/uk/en\" title=\"\"><strong>Tony\u2019s Chocolonely</strong></a>. The retro-wrapped bars are gloriously weighty (180g, \u00a33.98), and there\u2019s a truly admirable ethos behind the company. I had high hopes for the 51% <strong>Dark Almond Sea Salt</strong>, but I have come to hate salt in chocolate; the first bite is wonderful, but thereafter tiring and confusing. But others declared it some of the best chocolate they\u2019d eaten, and the Milk (32%) is sweet, creamy and could easily replace a more famous milk chocolate. Be warned, the thumb-thick pieces are not uniform: a nightmare for a dispensing parent.</p> <p>Two chunky bars which I ate whole were <a href=\"https://uk.venchi.com/milk-chocolate-hazelnut-bar-no-added-sugar\" title=\"\"><strong>Venchi\u2019s Nocciolata</strong></a> (100g, \u00a36): milk chocolate with whole Piedmont hazelnuts, but maltitol instead of sugar. I was appalled I liked it so much (not a fan of artificial sweeteners).</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.hotelchocolat.com/uk/corn-flakes-and-milk-slab.html\" title=\"\"><strong>Hotel Chocolat\u2019s Corn Flakes &amp; Milk</strong></a> (90g, \u00a33.95) was my nemesis. It is the perfect everything: one small slab, thick enough to feel indulgent without threatening dental displacement. With no piece demarcations to navigate, you have to eat the whole damn thing, and the malty flavour owns you; if you\u2019ve grown out of Maltesers, look at this.</p>",

I can appreciate thoroughbred thinness in super-high-cocoa chocolate, as anyone who has tried to wrestle a segment from a 70% plus bar will testify: you want it to snap easily. But who can resist the shameless confidence of chunky chocolate? I was particularly excited by the newish Tony\u2019s Chocolonely. The retro-wrapped bars are gloriously weighty (180g, \u00a33.98), and there\u2019s a truly admirable ethos behind the company. I had high hopes for the 51% Dark Almond Sea Salt, but I have come to hate salt in chocolate; the first bite is wonderful, but thereafter tiring and confusing. But others declared it some of the best chocolate they\u2019d eaten, and the Milk (32%) is sweet, creamy and could easily replace a more famous milk chocolate. Be warned, the thumb-thick pieces are not uniform: a nightmare for a dispensing parent. Two chunky bars which I ate whole were Venchi\u2019s Nocciolata (100g, \u00a36): milk chocolate with whole Piedmont hazelnuts, but maltitol instead of sugar. I was appalled I liked it so much (not a fan of artificial sweeteners). Hotel Chocolat\u2019s Corn Flakes &amp; Milk (90g, \u00a33.95) was my nemesis. It is the perfect everything: one small slab, thick enough to feel indulgent without threatening dental displacement. With no piece demarcations to navigate, you have to eat the whole damn thing, and the malty flavour owns you; if you\u2019ve grown out of Maltesers, look at this.",

It\u2019s a parade of dishes which, on a colour chart, would run the gamut from \u201cdark earth\u201d through \u201csilted river bed\u201d all the way to \u201cploughed field\u201d. Personally, I have no problem with brown food; some of the most intense, strident dishes I have ever eaten have been brown. In cooking, caramelisation is your friend and caramel is brown. Others feel differently.

It\u2019s a\u00a0boisterous bit of overtly butch cookery. Come for this</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some will protest that precious metals as food decoration is a cultural thing, with a venerable history in Indian cookery. But I\u2019m not in India. I\u2019m on Maddox Street on the edge of London\u2019s Mayfair, where there\u2019s already too much pointless gilding. I don\u2019t like eating things which serve no nutritional purpose. I particularly don\u2019t like eating things which are destined to travel straight through me so that the product at the other end turns out so glittery you could hang it on a Christmas tree if, say, Tim Burton was in charge of the decorations.</p> <p>Apart from offering the opportunity to make poo jokes in a restaurant review \u2013 never to be missed \u2013 there\u2019s a more serious point here. How do we evaluate a restaurant like this, where the substantial bill clearly pays for things like silver leaf on the cauliflower, which have nothing to do with the food? For a start, Lucknow 49 is a very comfortable restaurant, literally so. The upholstered bench seating is stacked with throw cushions and bolsters \u2013 so many, indeed, that I have to chuck a few off to create a space in which to wriggle my sizeable arse. There is olive green paintwork, as well as what looks like hand-printed decoration around the archway into the back-dining room, and blocky floral prints. It\u2019s a self-conscious take on the domestic, the sort of relaxed style that costs proper money. Accordingly, the cheapest bottle of wine is \u00a329 for something drinkable the name of which I can\u2019t recall, and the dinner bill for two will easily break \u00a3130.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"618e56bdfb65efdc22c87ece3916c1522b2951bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/618e56bdfb65efdc22c87ece3916c1522b2951bd/0_150_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Offered on the bone, to which strands cling with little resolve\u2019: raan masala\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Offered on the bone, to which strands cling with little resolve\u2019: raan masala</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Let\u2019s stop there for a moment. The fact that you can visit a serviceable high-street curry house and pay buttons for indeterminate animal protein batch-cooked in a glowing sauce, which will repeat on you for days, does not mean food from the Indian tradition should never cost as much as that from France, Italy or Japan. If you believe that, you are dismissing the whole of Indian culture as somehow inferior. You will need to have a long hard talk with yourself.</p> <p>The food just needs to be worth it. At Lucknow 49, some of it pretty much is and some of it really isn\u2019t. (The \u00a39 paratha wraps stuffed with grilled lamb for takeaway at lunchtime may be the best deal). It all comes with a compelling narrative: after the fall of the Mughal empire, the royal family and their cooks shifted from Delhi to Lucknow. The double lamb chops here, cooked over charcoal, are big, meaty beasts, with a fine char, hot, crisped fat, and the rising scent of newly roasted spices. Lucky royal family. The <a href=\"https://www.lucknowldn.com/images/L49-menu-all.pdf\" title=\"\">online menu</a> shows them to be \u00a312.50 for two, which is good value for this quantity and quality of meat. I assume it was too much value, because at the restaurant these terrific chops are actually \u00a316. There are a few examples of this, which a polite person would describe as unfortunate. The menu has been updated since my visit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bcfc2b20c2a24ef276f5bf6467a45982c7225273\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bcfc2b20c2a24ef276f5bf6467a45982c7225273/0_377_5368_3221/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Ignore the silliness of the silver leaf\u2019: cauliflower.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Ignore the silliness of the silver leaf\u2019: cauliflower.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Boned chicken thighs are marinated in a saffron-flavoured cream before being charcoal grilled and are buttery and rich in all the right places. They are proof, if needed, that thigh wins out over breast every time. Potato and green chilli patties are sturdy rather than impressive. Flatbreads, stuffed with lentils and rice dumplings and a heavy dollop of yogurt and chutney, make up the numbers rather than thrill.</p> <p>Of the mains the true star is the raan masala. A classic raan recipe calls for a leg of lamb to be roasted for at least six hours and for as much as a day, until it has all but fallen apart into its deep dark sauce, with the edge of that caramel which comes with the virtuous interaction of meat and heat. Here, it is offered on the bone, to which strands cling with little resolve. It\u2019s a boisterous bit of overtly butch cookery. Come here for this.</p> <p>If you can ignore the silliness of the silver leaf, there\u2019s an equal heft to the cauliflower dish in its own dun-coloured sauce. Most importantly it has been timed perfectly. It could have been so much watery mush to be gummed away, but the cauliflower has tension and bite. Whole quail steamed in a stridently spiced gravy points up one of the issues with this kind of cookery. When a sauce is so multilayered and full on, the meat under it could be anything; quail is delicate and doesn\u2019t quite stand up to this armed assault, but the dish is not an unwelcome presence. Dhruv Mittal announced himself previously with a restaurant in Soho called Dum Biryani which, unsurprisingly, focused on pots of baked, accessorised rice. Curiously it is the goat biryani here which is the least impressive or generous. It\u2019s just a little dry and meagre. The meat is tough.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"68e1a6a46635087c0bb72336deb5ba7a8c7112e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68e1a6a46635087c0bb72336deb5ba7a8c7112e4/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A little dry\u2019: goat biryani.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A little dry\u2019: goat biryani.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Still there is a luscious, albeit small serving of dal makhani for \u00a37 with which to lubricate it. Finally, there are a couple of extremely sweet desserts, a carrot halwa and a milk cake with alphonso mango, to detain you, although not for very long. This is one of those moments where not only do I have to separate the impact of silver leaf from the underlying dish, but also my very pleasant night out from the cost of the experience.</p> <p>Understand Lucknow 49 as a relaxed Indian restaurant in London\u2019s Mayfair that will only occasionally knock your socks off, but will still show you a nice time along the way, and you won\u2019t be disappointed. Bizarrely, in a complex London restaurant sector that\u2019s sometimes tricky to navigate, it\u2019s more of a recommendation than it might seem.</p> <h2>News bites</h2> <p>Maddox Street has long been home to a bunch of serious places to eat. They\u2019re never cheap \u2013 this is London\u2019s Mayfair, after all \u2013 but some are very good indeed. Among those is the original branch of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/mar/08/goodman-restaurant-london\">Goodman</a>, which is firmly in the premier division of steakhouses. There\u2019s a strong choice of both breeds and cuts, all treated with due care and attention, as well as killer sides like the Josper grilled tomatoes and the truffle mash (<em><a href=\"https://www.goodmanrestaurants.com/\">goodmanrestaurants.com</a></em>).</p> <p>While we\u2019re in the area I have to record my dismay at the closure of Mark Jarvis\u2019s restaurant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/aug/19/stem-london---we-are-fed-delightfully---restaurant-review\">Stem</a>, just around the corner from Maddox Street on Princes Street. It was that rare thing: a small bistro knocking out cracking food at a reasonable price. Jarvis has blamed the closure on building works in the area which have harmed business and says they may come up with another plan for the site. I\u2019ll keep my fingers crossed.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in Manchester, the soon-to-open Stock Exchange Hotel has announced that the food and beverage operation will be overseen by Tom Kerridge of the <a href=\"https://www.thehandandflowers.co.uk/\">Hand and Flowers</a>. \u201cWe\u2019ll be bringing a bit of Marlow up to Manchester,\u201d Kerridge said.</p> <p><em>Email Jay at <a href=\"mailto:jay.rayner@observer.co.uk\" title=\"\">jay.rayner@observer.co.uk</a> or follow him on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jayrayner1?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">@jayrayner1</a></em></p> <p><br></p>",

Some will protest that precious metals as food decoration is a cultural thing, with a venerable history in Indian cookery. But I\u2019m not in India. I\u2019m on Maddox Street on the edge of London\u2019s Mayfair, where there\u2019s already too much pointless gilding. I don\u2019t like eating things which serve no nutritional purpose. I particularly don\u2019t like eating things which are destined to travel straight through me so that the product at the other end turns out so glittery you could hang it on a Christmas tree if, say, Tim Burton was in charge of the decorations. Apart from offering the opportunity to make poo jokes in a restaurant review \u2013 never to be missed \u2013 there\u2019s a more serious point here. How do we evaluate a restaurant like this, where the substantial bill clearly pays for things like silver leaf on the cauliflower, which have nothing to do with the food? For a start, Lucknow 49 is a very comfortable restaurant, literally so. The upholstered bench seating is stacked with throw cushions and bolsters \u2013 so many, indeed, that I have to chuck a few off to create a space in which to wriggle my sizeable arse. There is olive green paintwork, as well as what looks like hand-printed decoration around the archway into the back-dining room, and blocky floral prints. It\u2019s a self-conscious take on the domestic, the sort of relaxed style that costs proper money. Accordingly, the cheapest bottle of wine is \u00a329 for something drinkable the name of which I can\u2019t recall, and the dinner bill for two will easily break \u00a3130. Let\u2019s stop there for a moment. The fact that you can visit a serviceable high-street curry house and pay buttons for indeterminate animal protein batch-cooked in a glowing sauce, which will repeat on you for days, does not mean food from the Indian tradition should never cost as much as that from France, Italy or Japan. If you believe that, you are dismissing the whole of Indian culture as somehow inferior. You will need to have a long hard talk with yourself. The food just needs to be worth it. At Lucknow 49, some of it pretty much is and some of it really isn\u2019t. (The \u00a39 paratha wraps stuffed with grilled lamb for takeaway at lunchtime may be the best deal). It all comes with a compelling narrative: after the fall of the Mughal empire, the royal family and their cooks shifted from Delhi to Lucknow. The double lamb chops here, cooked over charcoal, are big, meaty beasts, with a fine char, hot, crisped fat, and the rising scent of newly roasted spices. Lucky royal family. The online menu shows them to be \u00a312.50 for two, which is good value for this quantity and quality of meat. I assume it was too much value, because at the restaurant these terrific chops are actually \u00a316. There are a few examples of this, which a polite person would describe as unfortunate. The menu has been updated since my visit. Boned chicken thighs are marinated in a saffron-flavoured cream before being charcoal grilled and are buttery and rich in all the right places. They are proof, if needed, that thigh wins out over breast every time. Potato and green chilli patties are sturdy rather than impressive. Flatbreads, stuffed with lentils and rice dumplings and a heavy dollop of yogurt and chutney, make up the numbers rather than thrill. Of the mains the true star is the raan masala. A classic raan recipe calls for a leg of lamb to be roasted for at least six hours and for as much as a day, until it has all but fallen apart into its deep dark sauce, with the edge of that caramel which comes with the virtuous interaction of meat and heat. Here, it is offered on the bone, to which strands cling with little resolve. It\u2019s a boisterous bit of overtly butch cookery. Come here for this. If you can ignore the silliness of the silver leaf, there\u2019s an equal heft to the cauliflower dish in its own dun-coloured sauce. Most importantly it has been timed perfectly. It could have been so much watery mush to be gummed away, but the cauliflower has tension and bite. Whole quail steamed in a stridently spiced gravy points up one of the issues with this kind of cookery. When a sauce is so multilayered and full on, the meat under it could be anything; quail is delicate and doesn\u2019t quite stand up to this armed assault, but the dish is not an unwelcome presence. Dhruv Mittal announced himself previously with a restaurant in Soho called Dum Biryani which, unsurprisingly, focused on pots of baked, accessorised rice. Curiously it is the goat biryani here which is the least impressive or generous. It\u2019s just a little dry and meagre. The meat is tough. Still there is a luscious, albeit small serving of dal makhani for \u00a37 with which to lubricate it. Finally, there are a couple of extremely sweet desserts, a carrot halwa and a milk cake with alphonso mango, to detain you, although not for very long. This is one of those moments where not only do I have to separate the impact of silver leaf from the underlying dish, but also my very pleasant night out from the cost of the experience. Understand Lucknow 49 as a relaxed Indian restaurant in London\u2019s Mayfair that will only occasionally knock your socks off, but will still show you a nice time along the way, and you won\u2019t be disappointed. Bizarrely, in a complex London restaurant sector that\u2019s sometimes tricky to navigate, it\u2019s more of a recommendation than it might seem. News bites Maddox Street has long been home to a bunch of serious places to eat. They\u2019re never cheap \u2013 this is London\u2019s Mayfair, after all \u2013 but some are very good indeed. Among those is the original branch of Goodman, which is firmly in the premier division of steakhouses. There\u2019s a strong choice of both breeds and cuts, all treated with due care and attention, as well as killer sides like the Josper grilled tomatoes and the truffle mash (goodmanrestaurants.com). While we\u2019re in the area I have to record my dismay at the closure of Mark Jarvis\u2019s restaurant Stem, just around the corner from Maddox Street on Princes Street. It was that rare thing: a small bistro knocking out cracking food at a reasonable price. Jarvis has blamed the closure on building works in the area which have harmed business and says they may come up with another plan for the site. I\u2019ll keep my fingers crossed. Meanwhile, in Manchester, the soon-to-open Stock Exchange Hotel has announced that the food and beverage operation will be overseen by Tom Kerridge of the Hand and Flowers. \u201cWe\u2019ll be bringing a bit of Marlow up to Manchester,\u201d Kerridge said.

We contort our bodies into something that looks impossible, taking our inspiration from things like The Matrix, anime cartoons, Dragon Ball Z.\u201d One of the moves, \u201cbone-breaking\u201d, looks as if limbs are being dislocated as the dancer\u2019s bodies \u201cfold like origami\u201d, as one critic noted. \u201cThat\u2019s very much our wow factor,\u201d Gray beams.</p> <p>Born in school canteen dance-offs, inter-school competitions followed, as did a high-profile appearance on America\u2019s Best Dance Crew. Gray formed his own dance collective that developed through various incarnations; his HyperActive crew evolved first into Maineventt and later to the Brooklyn Ringmasters and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/sep/26/flexn-review-angry-and-electrifying-commentary-on-black-lives-in-america\">FlexN</a>. Now, he has a 30-strong dance company called the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOrS5x02Vnw\">DREAM Ring</a>, which stands for \u201cDance Rules Everything Around Me\u201d.</p> <p>Recruiting dancers from predominantly underrepresented and impoverished urban backgrounds, Gray says that flexing gave people a voice in communities where they were historically silenced. \u201cThere are ways of conveying a message when you dance. A lot of the time it can be pure entertainment, but flexing is a mode of storytelling. It\u2019s a lot more than just entertainment or a wow factor: it\u2019s a vocabulary, a means of expression for those who previously had none. Our bodies become the vocabulary.\u201d</p> <p>Telling stories through vignettes of the everyday became a part of a much bigger narrative for flexing too, with performances often tackling the political or, as Gray puts it, \u201cdifficult issues that our community face every day\u201d. He elaborates further: \u201cWe\u2019re dancing about the issues that are happening around us, all of us as people, no matter where we are all experiencing those issues. We\u2019re all going through the same thing, just in different ways.</p> <p>\u201cI think the vocabulary with flexing is what allows it to speak to people all over the world because it comes from a human place. When you see the realness and the emotion and the feel of it, people connect with it.\u201d Yet dealing with issues such as race divisions in the US alongside a pioneering new dance style meant initially people didn\u2019t know how to interpret them. \u201cThere was so much scepticism about who we were. We had to work extra hard to make people believe in us.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"039ac7b99e6562b71b92803ba889bbffe98f412b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/039ac7b99e6562b71b92803ba889bbffe98f412b/0_440_4000_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Reggie \u2018Regg Roc\u2019 Gray\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reggie \u2018Regg Roc\u2019 Gray will bring Alphabus to Manchester this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joel Chester Fildes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Following projects with MIF in <a href=\"https://mif.co.uk/previous-festivals/mif15/flexn-manchester-the-d-r-e-a-m-ring/\">2015</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/jun/13/10-of-the-brightest-stars-of-manchester-international-festival-2017\">2017</a>, for this year\u2019s festival Gray\u2019s dancers are teaming up with <a href=\"https://youngidentity.org/\">Young Identity</a> \u2013 a Manchester-based arts organisation and charity that works to empower young people from working-class backgrounds through spoken word.

We took part in a poetry slam called The World Cup which was led by Apple and Snakes, an organisation who brought a group of poetry organisations from across the UK together.

      "bodyText": "Brooklyn-based dancer Reggie \u201cRegg Roc\u201d Gray never imagined that a street dance style he invented during his lunchtimes at school would go on to become a global craze. Used by Madonna, Beyonc\u00e9, Jay-Z and Nicki Minaj, to name a few, Gray\u2019s \u201cflexing\u201d dance became a phenomenon thanks to the audacity of its moves \u2013 many of which look physically impossible \u2013 and its powerful political comment. \u201cThe style itself was an evolution of the bruk-up and a lot of dancehall from the early 90s,\u201d Gray explains of flexing\u2019s Jamaican roots. \u201cBruk-up means \u2018broke up\u2019 and in flexing, moves are broken up and limbs flexed awkwardly. We contort our bodies into something that looks impossible, taking our inspiration from things like The Matrix, anime cartoons, Dragon Ball Z.\u201d One of the moves, \u201cbone-breaking\u201d, looks as if limbs are being dislocated as the dancer\u2019s bodies \u201cfold like origami\u201d, as one critic noted. \u201cThat\u2019s very much our wow factor,\u201d Gray beams. Born in school canteen dance-offs, inter-school competitions followed, as did a high-profile appearance on America\u2019s Best Dance Crew. Gray formed his own dance collective that developed through various incarnations; his HyperActive crew evolved first into Maineventt and later to the Brooklyn Ringmasters and FlexN. Now, he has a 30-strong dance company called the DREAM Ring, which stands for \u201cDance Rules Everything Around Me\u201d. Recruiting dancers from predominantly underrepresented and impoverished urban backgrounds, Gray says that flexing gave people a voice in communities where they were historically silenced. \u201cThere are ways of conveying a message when you dance. A lot of the time it can be pure entertainment, but flexing is a mode of storytelling. It\u2019s a lot more than just entertainment or a wow factor: it\u2019s a vocabulary, a means of expression for those who previously had none. Our bodies become the vocabulary.\u201d Telling stories through vignettes of the everyday became a part of a much bigger narrative for flexing too, with performances often tackling the political or, as Gray puts it, \u201cdifficult issues that our community face every day\u201d. He elaborates further: \u201cWe\u2019re dancing about the issues that are happening around us, all of us as people, no matter where we are all experiencing those issues. We\u2019re all going through the same thing, just in different ways. \u201cI think the vocabulary with flexing is what allows it to speak to people all over the world because it comes from a human place. When you see the realness and the emotion and the feel of it, people connect with it.\u201d Yet dealing with issues such as race divisions in the US alongside a pioneering new dance style meant initially people didn\u2019t know how to interpret them. \u201cThere was so much scepticism about who we were. We had to work extra hard to make people believe in us.\u201d Following projects with MIF in 2015 and 2017, for this year\u2019s festival Gray\u2019s dancers are teaming up with Young Identity \u2013 a Manchester-based arts organisation and charity that works to empower young people from working-class backgrounds through spoken word. Working with artists such as Lemn Sissay, Saul Williams, Linton Kwesi Johnson and Kate Tempest, the collective encourages individuals to tell the stories of the here and now through poetry, their ethos chiming with Gray\u2019s. \u201cWe started Young Identity because we thought black, working-class voices in poetry were just not heard,\u201d says Shirley May, its CEO and artistic director. \u201cAnd of those that were heard, they were male. We started out to give a voice to young black men and women. We took part in a poetry slam called The World Cup which was led by Apple and Snakes, an organisation who brought a group of poetry organisations from across the UK together. In many ways, we mirrored what happened to Reggie with flexing: he gave a voice to those without one through the power of movement; we give it through the power of spoken word and poetry.\u201d Alphabus will bring together dancers from New York and poets from Manchester in a project that utilises ideas from African, Greek and east Asian mythology to help understand the present day through language and movement. As one of the project\u2019s writers, Billie Meredith, explains: \u201cHumanity is timeless and, regardless of location, all of our stories stem from something universal: a moral question that\u2019s relatable to now, to forever. \u201cThe project revolves around language and movement. Alphabus \u2013 \u2018alpha\u2019 as in alphabet, \u2018bus\u2019 as in movement \u2013 is the central character of our narrative but at no given time is Alphabus one person. He or she is many identities and all of us. The overarching message is about the human condition and the relationships we have.\u201d The universality of the message has a political edge too, with May revealing that Brexit was an issue many of Young Identity\u2019s young poets wanted to explore in the project\u2019s early planning sessions. Part of the Alphabus story seeks to explore the dystopia of the debate through generational divides in a way that may ultimately make their audiences see alternate points of view. \u201cIt\u2019s a modern story and the journey of a relationship and how that relationship can change, can cause revolution, war, peace,\u201d she says. We\u2019re not here to preach or testify. The beauty of art is that it is completely subjective and the information we give in the show is for our audiences to go away and wrestle with their feelings over that.\u201d Gray agrees: \u201cThe poetry and the dance are to be interpreted the way the audience see it. I don\u2019t look for it to be a definite definition. It\u2019s the interpretation of the audience and how they feel.

The <em>NYT</em> published a long apology and decided to end all syndicated cartoons. On Monday, it announced that it was dropping all cartoons, syndicated and in-house, from its international edition. The newspaper did not deny that the decision was linked to the furore over antisemitism, but insisted that it wanted to bring the international edition in line with the US edition, which abandoned political cartoons some time ago.</p> <p>Cartoons are at the cutting edge of free expression because they are dangerous.

      "bodyText": "What does a newspaper do if it publishes an antisemitic cartoon? Determine that it won\u2019t do so again? Or stop publishing cartoons? The New York Times appears to have taken the second route. In April, its international edition (which is distinct from its US edition) ran a syndicated cartoon by the Portuguese cartoonist Ant\u00f3nio Moreira Antunes that depicted the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, as a guide dog leading a blind Donald Trump wearing a yarmulke. It was widely condemned as antisemitic. The NYT published a long apology and decided to end all syndicated cartoons. On Monday, it announced that it was dropping all cartoons, syndicated and in-house, from its international edition. The newspaper did not deny that the decision was linked to the furore over antisemitism, but insisted that it wanted to bring the international edition in line with the US edition, which abandoned political cartoons some time ago. Cartoons are at the cutting edge of free expression because they are dangerous. By their nature, they can be shocking, offensive, disturbing. Often, they cross the line. But they can also expose power and pomposity with a clarity and sharpness unique to a cartoon. That\u2019s why the most repressive regimes in the world routinely jail cartoonists: Jiang Yefei in China, Atena Farghadani in Iran, Musa Kart in Turkey, Ram\u00f3n Ns\u00e9 Esono Ebal\u00e9 in Equatorial Guinea. And then, of course, there are the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists, murdered for the offence they caused. A commitment to freedom of expression requires us to accept that we will make mistakes. When that happens, and however strong the backlash, our response cannot be to hide away from the very possibility of making any more mistakes. That way leads to a world in which we refuse to say, write or publish anything dangerous at all. \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",

According to Human Rights Watch, protesters were chased, whipped, shot at and, according to several reports, raped. Initial reports put the death toll at 30. But, as the Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors continued to investigate, the figure continued to rise to 60. By 6 June, they believed that 108 people had been killed (including 40 people whose bodies had been pulled from the Nile, footage showed that their limbs had been weighed down with cement bricks to keep their bodies below water). As of 12 June, the committee estimate the death toll at 118 people. But state sources disagree. Initially, the state news agency claimed that just 46 people had died. Later, the director general of the health ministry put the figure at 61. They have not updated these numbers in response to the bodies which have been counted by the Sudanese doctors committee.",

      "body": "<p>We are entering an age in which you can no longer trust your ears or eyes. Bots, trolls and fake news merchants have demolished the idea that you can believe what you read online. But audio and video always felt like truth\u2019s life raft, offering an accurate portrayal of reality we could cling to.</p> \n<p>Not for much longer. Forget post-truth, this is the era of post-reality, where \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/12/deep-fakes-fake-news-truth\" title=\"\">deep fake</a>\u201d software will allow anyone to create believable video footage of anyone saying anything. Last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/11/deepfake-zuckerberg-instagram-facebook\" title=\"\">some artists published</a> a convincing deep fake of Facebook chief, Mark Zuckerberg, saying: \u201cThe more you express yourself, the more we own you.\u201d A couple of months ago, Barack Obama was out there telling viewers to \u201cstay woke, bitches\u201d, while before that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2018/mar/24/emma-gonzalezs-powerful-march-for-our-lives-speech-in-full-video\" title=\"\">young anti-gun activist Emma Gonz\u00e1lez</a> was faked into tearing up the US constitution, to the misplaced fury of some Republicans.</p> \n<p>There are hundreds of these videos circulating, with more every day. The US House intelligence committee, worried by the possible national security risks, met to discuss this last week.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/11/deepfake-zuckerberg-instagram-facebook\">Doctored video of sinister Mark Zuckerberg puts Facebook to the test</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In some ways, deep fakes aren\u2019t all that new: the selective editing and clipping of real footage to create a falsehood, a \u201cshallow fake\u201d, you could say, is already the staple of conspiracy theorists and even the odd respectable news outlet. And large-scale political fakery is as old as the hills: your grandparents might remember the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/feb/04/uk.politicalnews6\" title=\"\">Zinoviev letter</a>\u201d, a 1924 forgery published by the <em>Daily Mail</em> that was purportedly from the Soviet Comintern, asking the British Communist party to engage in sedition.</p> \n<p>The difference now is that it is cheaper, easier, quicker and done far better. Deep fakes still aren\u2019t perfect, but digital technologies improve rapidly. They were originally designed to improve movie production, but within five years what was once the million-dollar CGI preserve of Hollywood studios will be a free app on your phone.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s easy to imagine what happens then. Fake but perfect videos will circulate of Donald Trump saying he\u2019s secretly a member of the Ku Klux Klan or that George Soros is funding an anti-democratic coup. You will see the announcement of a nuclear strike \u2013 leaked on Twitter. A supposedly \u201cprivate recording\u201d where a candidate admits to colluding with a foreign government will fly around the world faster and farther than any press-released rebuttal. No doubt a future Cambridge Analytica will be paid to make sure these videos reach certain key swing voters the day before an election.</p> \n<p>The possibilities are especially dangerous in countries with existing ethnic or religious tensions and less experience in dealing with digital literacy. In India, simple faked images and videos of alleged child kidnappings have led to lynchings, while in Gabon rumours about a deep fake video of President Ali Bongo created a political crisis. The problem won\u2019t be restricted to the rich and famous \u2013 you too might be the subject of a deep fake. There are chatrooms in seedy digital corners where developers will make fake sex tapes of anyone you ask them to \u2013 an ex, an annoying colleague? \u2013 for around $20. (Like many pioneering technologies, deep fakes are being popularised via pornography.)</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"87f812b8-2dda-4e44-bac0-a7c407f304c6\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/F7_DBM7OIfM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There is already a counter-movement: academic conferences, the US military and Facebook researchers are all involved in an arms race, trying to build fraud-spotting tech. (Literally in some cases: one technique involves looking for unusual arm gesticulation.) This is vital work \u2013 perhaps the most important technological task of the next 10 years \u2013 but it\u2019s only part of the answer.

      "bodyText": "We are entering an age in which you can no longer trust your ears or eyes. Bots, trolls and fake news merchants have demolished the idea that you can believe what you read online. But audio and video always felt like truth\u2019s life raft, offering an accurate portrayal of reality we could cling to. Not for much longer. Forget post-truth, this is the era of post-reality, where \u201cdeep fake\u201d software will allow anyone to create believable video footage of anyone saying anything. Last week, some artists published a convincing deep fake of Facebook chief, Mark Zuckerberg, saying: \u201cThe more you express yourself, the more we own you.\u201d A couple of months ago, Barack Obama was out there telling viewers to \u201cstay woke, bitches\u201d, while before that the young anti-gun activist Emma Gonz\u00e1lez was faked into tearing up the US constitution, to the misplaced fury of some Republicans. There are hundreds of these videos circulating, with more every day. The US House intelligence committee, worried by the possible national security risks, met to discuss this last week. In some ways, deep fakes aren\u2019t all that new: the selective editing and clipping of real footage to create a falsehood, a \u201cshallow fake\u201d, you could say, is already the staple of conspiracy theorists and even the odd respectable news outlet. And large-scale political fakery is as old as the hills: your grandparents might remember the \u201cZinoviev letter\u201d, a 1924 forgery published by the Daily Mail that was purportedly from the Soviet Comintern, asking the British Communist party to engage in sedition. The difference now is that it is cheaper, easier, quicker and done far better. Deep fakes still aren\u2019t perfect, but digital technologies improve rapidly. They were originally designed to improve movie production, but within five years what was once the million-dollar CGI preserve of Hollywood studios will be a free app on your phone. It\u2019s easy to imagine what happens then. Fake but perfect videos will circulate of Donald Trump saying he\u2019s secretly a member of the Ku Klux Klan or that George Soros is funding an anti-democratic coup. You will see the announcement of a nuclear strike \u2013 leaked on Twitter. A supposedly \u201cprivate recording\u201d where a candidate admits to colluding with a foreign government will fly around the world faster and farther than any press-released rebuttal. No doubt a future Cambridge Analytica will be paid to make sure these videos reach certain key swing voters the day before an election. The possibilities are especially dangerous in countries with existing ethnic or religious tensions and less experience in dealing with digital literacy. In India, simple faked images and videos of alleged child kidnappings have led to lynchings, while in Gabon rumours about a deep fake video of President Ali Bongo created a political crisis. The problem won\u2019t be restricted to the rich and famous \u2013 you too might be the subject of a deep fake. There are chatrooms in seedy digital corners where developers will make fake sex tapes of anyone you ask them to \u2013 an ex, an annoying colleague? \u2013 for around $20. (Like many pioneering technologies, deep fakes are being popularised via pornography.) There is already a counter-movement: academic conferences, the US military and Facebook researchers are all involved in an arms race, trying to build fraud-spotting tech. (Literally in some cases: one technique involves looking for unusual arm gesticulation.) This is vital work \u2013 perhaps the most important technological task of the next 10 years \u2013 but it\u2019s only part of the answer. Deep fakes\u2019 greatest strength is not technological, but our willingness to believe and click \u201cshare\u201d for any old nonsense so long as it fits in with our pre-existing views about the world. You might assume that deep fakes mean everyone will believe everything they see, but the real risk to democracy is the opposite: no one will believe anything at all. If everything is potentially fakable, everything can be dismissed as lie. A leading politician caught lying on camera? It\u2019s a deep fake!

Over the past few years, they have developed a new technique of censorship by distraction, smothering truths under a torrent of meaningless rubbish. They will soon be able to do this automatically, pumping out millions or even billions of pieces of content to keep everyone suitably confused. As the political scientist Hannah Arendt wrote in the 1950s, the ideal subject of an authoritarian regime is not a committed Nazi or Bolshevik, but someone for whom \u201cthe distinction between fact and fiction, true and false, no longer exists\u201d, because they are far more malleable.

      "bodyText": "Seven infant monkeys were accidentally poisoned and died at one of the largest primate research centers in the US, internal documents shared with the Guardian have revealed. The young macaques died after their mothers were marked with dye at the University of California, Davis, primate research laboratory. Once reunited with their infants, the female macaques inadvertently transferred the dye, which proved toxic to them. Seven of the infants, none more than a few weeks old \u2013 with one just a day old \u2013 subsequently died. UC Davis reported the incidents to federal authorities in April 2018, with further details provided in a letter sent a year later. In the latter document, UC Davis told the federal watchdog Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare that two of the infants were found to have \u201cgeneralized weakness and respiratory distress\u201d, with dye found on their lips and tongues. Both of these infants had \u201csevere edema and swelling of the larynx and tongue\u201d and, despite emergency treatment, died. The other deceased infants were \u201ceither found dead or euthanized upon arrival at the hospital\u201d. All seven of them had some amount of dye on their fur, skin or around the mouth, which probably triggered a deadly allergic reaction. In response, the Office of Laboratory and Animal Welfare told UC Davis that infants aged under six months should not be marked with dye and that mothers and babies should be kept apart longer to minimize the transfer of the markings. The correspondence has been released under Freedom of Information laws. The tragedy is the latest blow to the primate research operation at UC Davis, one of the largest in the country. The university said it had about 4,200 primates, mostly rhesus macaques, which it keeps for research into HIV/Aids, Zika virus and other infectious diseases, respiratory disease, reproductive health, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and ageing. In 2016, it emerged that UC Davis was among nine federally funded research centers being investigated over mistreatment of primates. In March of that year, a primate fractured both legs after escaping through an unsecured door at the facility, with another primate subsequently injured following a similar incident. UC Davis has been targeted by animal rights activists over these incidents, as well as a 2005 episode where seven monkeys died from apparent heat exposure. The US Department of Agriculture subsequently handed the university a $4,815 fine. The latest deaths show that \u201cseven infant rhesus monkeys ranging in age from one to 19 days of age were forcibly removed from their mothers, had a physical exam, were tattooed, had blood drawn, were marked with a dye with irritant capacity, and then placed back on their anesthetized and unresponsive mothers\u201d, said John Gluck, an academic and former primate researcher. \u201cHow could UC Davis fail to consider that this intensely stress-provoking experience would not place these infants at risk? Negligence is the word I would use.\u201d The New England Anti-Vivisection Society, which wants UC Davis and other facilities to reduce the numbers of primates used for research, said it has written to the USDA requesting that the university be fined $70,000 over the infant monkey deaths. \u201cIt\u2019s 2019, and we can no longer deny the science that shows non-human primates suffer like we would and feel pain like we do,\u201d said Mike Ryan, head of government affairs at the group. \u201cInvasive and deadly experiments on captive primates who are abused in cages for their entire lives must end.\u201d The US government has curbed some primate research in recent years, with the National Institutes of Health announcing in 2015 it would no longer fund biomedical research on chimpanzees. Facing hefty public opposition to primate testing, some facilities, such as at Harvard, have wound down their programs and sent their apes and monkeys to sanctuaries.

But when Sammy died, confesses Wodehouse, \u2018I made what I think was a mistake by appointing as his successor an Aberdeen terrier who was supposed (though he seldom did) to answer to the name of Angus\u2026 Angus had a way of standing in front of me and looking at me like a Scottish preacher about to rebuke the sins of his congregation.\u2019 One can only marvel over the following sentences \u2013 the first for its parenthetical descent and the second for being appallingly funny. \u2018Over Bill, the foxhound, even Mr Erwitt, broadminded though he is, would, I\u2019m afraid, have shaken his head. Bill was a stray in the last stages of starvation and so covered with ticks that only the keenest eye could detect that there was a dog underneath.\u2019 Finally, he considers the \u2018hotly debated\u2019 question of whether dogs have a sense of humour. \u2018My own opinion is that some have and some don\u2019t. Dachshunds have, but not St Bernards and Great Danes. Apparently a dog has to be small to be fond of a joke. You never find an Irish wolfhound trying to be a stand-up comic.\u2019 Just perfect.",

The International Renewable Energy Agency says that the cost of solar PV and onshore wind decreased by 13% last year and that renewable power is already the cheapest source of electricity in many parts of the world. Former US energy secretary Steven Chu confirms that the cost of renewable energy at the best sites is now as low as 2 cents per kilowatt hour \u2013 and falling.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the oil and gas sector is planning to spend more on exploration and extraction and seems either unaware of the accelerating transfer to clean technologies or overreliant on unproved carbon capture methods. The danger is that, as households, car owners and industries choose greener options, trillions of pounds of insurance companies\u2019 and pension funds\u2019 assets may become stranded beneath the seabed. If, as seems increasingly likely, the market may eventually manage the demands of the Paris agreement, perhaps the Treasury should concentrate on discouraging investment in the oil and gas industry. <br><strong>Eurof</strong><strong> Thomas</strong><br>Cardiff<br></p> <h2>This white male is no whiner<br></h2> <p>As a white, heterosexual male, I appear to have upset Barbara Ellen (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/08/time-gay-people-stepped-aside-hetero-whiners-have-rights-too\" title=\"\">It\u2019s time gay people stepped aside\u2026 hetero whiners have rights too</a>\u201d, Comment).

Who sells the guns and ammunition used in these conflicts?

According to the Campaign Against Arms Trade, in the four years since the Saudi-led coalition started its attacks in Yemen, \u201cthe UK has enabled the war with \u00a35bn of arms sales\u201d. The Civilian Impact Monitoring Project reports that airstrikes, some with UK-made aircraft and bombs, killed or injured more than 400 children in the last year alone. If we knew more about these wars, perhaps we would ban such exports and campaign to persuade other industrial nations to do the same. Instead, our government allows DSEI, one of the biggest arms fairs, to come to London in September and will welcome arms dealers and military delegations from around the world.<br><strong>Michael Bassey</strong><br>Coddington, Newark, Notts</p> <h2>Poor pay of care workers<br></h2> <p>One thing your article on care workers didn\u2019t mention was the pay (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/09/6000-residential-care-workers-suffer-violent-attacks\" title=\"\">Revealed: 6,000 residential care workers suffer violent attacks</a>\u201d, News).

The International Renewable Energy Agency says that the cost of solar PV and onshore wind decreased by 13% last year and that renewable power is already the cheapest source of electricity in many parts of the world. Former US energy secretary Steven Chu confirms that the cost of renewable energy at the best sites is now as low as 2 cents per kilowatt hour \u2013 and falling. Meanwhile, the oil and gas sector is planning to spend more on exploration and extraction and seems either unaware of the accelerating transfer to clean technologies or overreliant on unproved carbon capture methods. The danger is that, as households, car owners and industries choose greener options, trillions of pounds of insurance companies\u2019 and pension funds\u2019 assets may become stranded beneath the seabed. If, as seems increasingly likely, the market may eventually manage the demands of the Paris agreement, perhaps the Treasury should concentrate on discouraging investment in the oil and gas industry. Eurof Thomas Cardiff This white male is no whiner As a white, heterosexual male, I appear to have upset Barbara Ellen (\u201cIt\u2019s time gay people stepped aside\u2026 hetero whiners have rights too\u201d, Comment). May I apologise on behalf of myself and others like me who have spent their lives unaware of the misery that we have brought to so many people? Most of my friends and acquaintances are heterosexual, though a few would describe themselves as LGBT. No one appears to question their own or anyone else\u2019s sexuality and I would argue that there is a general acceptance and tolerance of each other. I have to say that I have never come across this group of whining, privileged people with whom Barbara Ellen appears to associate. Most people I know get on with their lives and other people. John Tait Falkirk The UK\u2019s weapons of war Simon Tisdall\u2019s horrendous account of the under-reported conflicts in Cameroon and across the Sahel region, coupled with the reports that do reach us of the conflict in Yemen, must lead us to ask: who provides the weapons of murder? Who sells the guns and ammunition used in these conflicts? (\u201cIn a world full of festering wars, why are so many of them ignored?\u201d, World) The answer is that Britain does, in company with other industrialised countries. According to the Campaign Against Arms Trade, in the four years since the Saudi-led coalition started its attacks in Yemen, \u201cthe UK has enabled the war with \u00a35bn of arms sales\u201d. The Civilian Impact Monitoring Project reports that airstrikes, some with UK-made aircraft and bombs, killed or injured more than 400 children in the last year alone. If we knew more about these wars, perhaps we would ban such exports and campaign to persuade other industrial nations to do the same. Instead, our government allows DSEI, one of the biggest arms fairs, to come to London in September and will welcome arms dealers and military delegations from around the world. Michael Bassey Coddington, Newark, Notts Poor pay of care workers One thing your article on care workers didn\u2019t mention was the pay (\u201cRevealed: 6,000 residential care workers suffer violent attacks\u201d, News). My 25-year-old granddaughter, a graduate, earns the minimum wage at a nearby care home for people with dementia. The weeks of training for the 12-hour shifts included methods to avoid assaults, including punching and groping. She bathes the residents, feeds them, cleans them when they soil themselves and lays them out when they die. I wouldn\u2019t do this work for twice the living wage, let alone \u00a38.21 an hour. She finds the job very rewarding. But she has no chance of getting her own home. And what of her future? She is looking to find a kinder, fairer country to emigrate to. What have we come to? Pat Smith Bishampton, Pershore, Worcestershire Ich bin ein geordie My late father\u2019s wartime and postwar experience provides a textbook example of the \u201cnever again\u201d instincts of D-Day veterans described by Will Hutton (\u201cThese old heroes evoked a glorious shared purpose. It\u2019s now under threat\u201d, Comment). Coming from the poorest part of Newcastle, he spent five years in prison camp. However, his friendly disposition meant that he learned from his German captors to \u201cspeak the language like a Prussian\u201d. After 1945, he was a natural for the Tyneside Anglo-German Friendship Society, through which he met German guest workers helping to get industry going again in Gateshead. In due course, my parents celebrated their silver wedding anniversary with their friends in Bavaria. Incidentally, he had served in the Tyneside Scottish Battalion of the Black Watch, which provided another cross-cultural experience of sorts in a camp where many came from beyond the Cheviots. He would have had nothing but scorn for the dangerous anti-German fantasies spewed out by gung-ho Brexiters. Geoff Reid Bradford, Yorkshire The only way is Essex As an Essex man, could I ask Euan Ferguson to explain what he meant in his review of 63 Up (Television, the New Review) when he described naughty Tony as \u201cnow Essexed in every sense\u201d? I hadn\u2019t noted that Tony now writes serious music like son of Essex Mark-Anthony Turnage, or perhaps he has joined a book club (we have the densest concentration of them in the country)? I would remind Euan of Germaine Greer\u2019s description of the place as \u201ca county of wide open skies, pretty girls and no snobs\u201d. Michael Munt Wivenhoe, Colchester",

      "body": "<p>The Conservative right has become the enemy within, a force bent on destroying not only our relationship with Europe but with much else that this country holds dear. The shredding of collective bargaining and the ambition to excuse our privatised utilities from their public-interest obligations were early objectives. Now there is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\" title=\"\">Brexit</a>. Next is the undermining of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc+politics/conservatives\" title=\"\">BBC</a>, along with the steady erosion of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/05/nhs-america-brexit-trump\" title=\"\">NHS</a> and the criminal justice system. The barbarians have stormed the gate in a libertarian assault on Britain\u2019s public institutions.</p> <p>The BBC is a longstanding target for their venom. Then chancellor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jul/06/osborne-slashes-bbc-budget-pay-over-75s-tv-licences\" title=\"\">George Osborne\u2019s decision in 2015</a>, conceived without consultation, to force it to shoulder the \u00a3750m annual cost of offering free BBC licence fees to the over-75s \u2013 turning an independent BBC into an arm of the Department for Work and Pensions \u2013 was a disgrace. It appeared to be part of his campaign to curry favour with the Tory right and show that even if he was a Remainer he was a fellow rightist at heart. The BBC board should have resigned en bloc.</p> <p>But it did not want to raise the stakes so high, preferring to take the path of least resistance, rescuing what it could. Last week, the chickens came home to roost. The corporation announced, after a consultation with <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-48583487\" title=\"\">190,000 people</a>, that it could only afford to continue to offer the concession to a third of the age group, the very poorest who receive pension credit. To find the \u00a3500m extra to sustain the concession to all over-75s would have implied making swingeing reductions to some of what BBC viewers and listeners regard as most precious: its radio services, its regional infrastructure, BBC2 and 4. Instead, it believes its current efficiency drive can allow it just to square the circle \u2013 meet its imposed obligations, if only to a third of the over-75s, and preserve the services to which they and its wider audiences are so attached.</p> <p>The enemy within went into attack mode immediately. No Tory leadership candidate who wants to win the votes of its Tory pensioner activists can back the BBC. The<em> Daily Telegraph</em> and <em>Daily Mail</em> went into overdrive. A week after the D-Day anniversary, this anti-British institution, they declared, anxious to protect its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jul/24/bbc-is-paying-too-much-for-talent-it-can-afford-to-lose\" title=\"\">overpaid presenters</a>, managers and lush pensions, had obliged hard-pressed over-75s \u2013 veterans \u2013 to find \u00a3154 a year out of their stagnant incomes.

      "bodyText": "The Conservative right has become the enemy within, a force bent on destroying not only our relationship with Europe but with much else that this country holds dear. The shredding of collective bargaining and the ambition to excuse our privatised utilities from their public-interest obligations were early objectives. Now there is Brexit. Next is the undermining of the BBC, along with the steady erosion of the NHS and the criminal justice system. The barbarians have stormed the gate in a libertarian assault on Britain\u2019s public institutions. The BBC is a longstanding target for their venom. Then chancellor George Osborne\u2019s decision in 2015, conceived without consultation, to force it to shoulder the \u00a3750m annual cost of offering free BBC licence fees to the over-75s \u2013 turning an independent BBC into an arm of the Department for Work and Pensions \u2013 was a disgrace. It appeared to be part of his campaign to curry favour with the Tory right and show that even if he was a Remainer he was a fellow rightist at heart. The BBC board should have resigned en bloc. But it did not want to raise the stakes so high, preferring to take the path of least resistance, rescuing what it could. Last week, the chickens came home to roost. The corporation announced, after a consultation with 190,000 people, that it could only afford to continue to offer the concession to a third of the age group, the very poorest who receive pension credit. To find the \u00a3500m extra to sustain the concession to all over-75s would have implied making swingeing reductions to some of what BBC viewers and listeners regard as most precious: its radio services, its regional infrastructure, BBC2 and 4. Instead, it believes its current efficiency drive can allow it just to square the circle \u2013 meet its imposed obligations, if only to a third of the over-75s, and preserve the services to which they and its wider audiences are so attached. The enemy within went into attack mode immediately. No Tory leadership candidate who wants to win the votes of its Tory pensioner activists can back the BBC. The Daily Telegraph and Daily Mail went into overdrive. A week after the D-Day anniversary, this anti-British institution, they declared, anxious to protect its overpaid presenters, managers and lush pensions, had obliged hard-pressed over-75s \u2013 veterans \u2013 to find \u00a3154 a year out of their stagnant incomes. This bloated liberal institution, home to Remain Britain, should be forced to pay for the pensioners\u2019 TV licence, cutting the pay of its well\u2013heeled staff to find the funds. Facts did not intrude into this argument: if every BBC presenter and manager earned no more than \u00a3150,000, well below the salaries of their tormentors and the \u00a3275,000 Boris Johnson gets for his Daily Telegraph column, the BBC would save no more than \u00a320m. Unhappily for its critics, because the BBC discloses the pay of its highly paid employees \u2013 and its wider workforce \u2013 more comprehensively and transparently than any other British organisation, it can prove its point. The greater truth is that it is being asked to find savings that represents a rounding error in Britain\u2019s \u00a3700bn a year of public spending for no other reason than the enemy within want to shrink it still further out of ideological conviction. It is already a quarter smaller in real terms than in was in 2010, besieged by behemoths like Netflix, Liberty Global and Fox, none of which cares a fig for British over-75s. Britain\u2019s pensioners deserve and want a BBC worth listening to and watching, that continues to embody the best of British values and culture, anchoring our national creativity, which overseas broadcasters want to milk rather than nurture.

On 4 June the Australian federal police raided the home of News Corp Australia journalist Annika Smethurst, investigating the alleged publication of \u201cofficial secrets\u201d. The investigation relates to a report in April 2018 that the heads of the defence and home affairs ministries had discussed draconian new powers to allow the ASD to spy on Australian citizens for the first time. After the raids, several news outlets including the Sydney Morning Herald reported that Malcolm Turnbull had ruled out using Australia\u2019s international spy agency to monitor Australians in a meeting of the national security committee of cabinet.

Barr has been willing to back up Trump.\u201d</p> <p>Sipher said Barr\u2019s review was \u201chunting for scapegoats\u201d.</p> <p>Among the key figures Trump and allies have often attacked for their roles in the Russia investigation which they vilify as a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d are: former FBI director James Comey, ex-CIA director John Brennan, ex-FBI agent Peter Strzok and ex-FBI lawyer Lisa Page.

      "bodyText": "Attorney general William Barr\u2019s controversial decision to launch a new inquiry into the origins of the FBI\u2019s 2016 Russia investigation has fueled concerns about the politicization of the justice department and could hamper attempts to combat Kremlin meddling in the 2020 election, say ex-top DoJ and CIA officials, and key Democrats. Critics say that Barr\u2019s investigation \u2013 which partially overlaps another one by the DoJ\u2019s own inspector general \u2013 will probably be used by Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign to fuel attacks on the special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s critical conclusions about Russian interference in the 2016 election and subsequent obstruction efforts by the president. Some critics see it as an overtly political \u201cinvestigation into the investigators\u201d that is pandering to Trump\u2019s oft-repeated claims that his 2016 election campaign was targeted by the so-called \u201cdeep state\u201d in an effort to thwart his election. Barr\u2019s review will scrutinize the FBI and key intelligence agencies involved in the initial stages of the 2016 Russia investigation which the FBI launched as a counter-intelligence investigation to examine early signs of Russian meddling in the election. John Sipher, who served in the CIA\u2019s National Clandestine Services for 28 years with a stint leading its Russia operations, said: \u201cTrump with Barr\u2019s help is trying to craft a narrative of a coup aimed at his campaign.\u201d Sipher added: \u201cThe attorney general has shown a willingness to play ball with Trump. Barr has been willing to back up Trump.\u201d Sipher said Barr\u2019s review was \u201chunting for scapegoats\u201d. Among the key figures Trump and allies have often attacked for their roles in the Russia investigation which they vilify as a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d are: former FBI director James Comey, ex-CIA director John Brennan, ex-FBI agent Peter Strzok and ex-FBI lawyer Lisa Page. Some Trump aides and allies have called on these figures to be prosecuted. \u201cEven if nothing is found they\u2019ve spun up their [political] base. There\u2019s no downside,\u201d Sipher said. Mary McCord, a former top DoJ prosecutor who led the department\u2019s national security division until spring 2017, said that launching a review into the genesis of the Russia investigation meant Barr was \u201callowing the president to have an open issue going into the 2020 elections that allows the whole witch-hunt\u201d mantra to gain traction. Trump\u2019s delight with Barr\u2019s sweeping non-criminal review, led by the US attorney for Connecticut, John Durham, has been palpable. \u201cI am so proud of our attorney general that he is looking into it,\u201d Trump has said. \u201cI think it\u2019s great.\u201d Trump\u2019s faith in Barr was also underscored when he gave him oversight of the review, passing over the director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, who would normally oversee such an investigation, the former FBI general counsel Jim Baker said.

      "bodyText": "The opening of a \u20ac600m super-museum in Berlin has been postponed to next year, raising sceptical eyebrows among locals wary of the German capital\u2019s growing tendency to deliver large public building projects late and over budget. The Humboldt Forum will host blockbuster exhibitions about world culture, anthropology and ethnology, and is also expected to delicately touch on Germany\u2019s under-explored colonial history. Described by some as Berlin\u2019s answer to the British Museum, it is housed inside the Stadtschloss, a reconstructed Prussian palace that was torn down by the Soviet administration of East Berlin in the 1950s. It was originally scheduled to open on 19 September with an exhibition to mark the 250th birthday of its namesake, the explorer and polymath Alexander von Humboldt. But on Wednesday the foundation charged with planning the museum conceded that because of technical issues, \u201cit is not realistic to expect to have the building ready to use as planned by the end of 2019\u201d. A wrongly programmed subterranean climate control system and pipework blocking emergency exit routes were among the factors that Petra Wesseler, the president of the Federal Office for Building and Regional Planning, blamed for the delay. Small engineering flaws have already snowballed into bigger problems for the Humboldt Forum: leading international museums including the Louvre, London\u2019s Victoria and Albert Museum and New York\u2019s MoMA reportedly declined to loan it about 150 exhibits while it was still a construction site. A launch exhibition centred around ivory was also postponed to 2020 because the material is particularly sensitive to sudden changes in temperature and humidity. Among Berliners, the museum\u2019s sputtering non-start has awoken tragicomic memories of the German capital\u2019s Berlin-Brandenburg airport, which still awaits completion seven years after it was shut down because of \u201ctechnical difficulties\u201d a month before its scheduled opening in 2012. Unlike the airport, which is likely to end up costing more than three times original estimates, the rebuilding of the 15th-century city palace that houses the new museum is expected to be completed within budget. A project contentious with many Berliners since it was first mooted in the early 90s, the rebuilding of the 44,000 sq metre palace prompted protests from those who accused it of being yet another expensive pastiche reconstruction of a historic building. Some curators have also complained that the Humboldt Forum\u2019s spectacular neoclassical outer shell is a burden to its contents, harking back to Berlin\u2019s pre-democratic past rather than looking to the future. In July, the French art historian B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Savoy resigned from the Humboldt Forum\u2019s advisory board, expressing her frustration with the lack of research into the provenance of objects scheduled to be exhibited in the space. Savoy said uncomfortable questions about the ethics of showcasing artefacts that European explorers had often taken from other continents without consent had merely been covered up by the Humboldt label \u201cto make sure that none of its radiation leaks outside\u201d. The Humboldt forum, she said, \u201cis like Chernobyl\u201d. The former British Museum director Neil MacGregor, who chairs the Humboldt\u2019s advisory committee, has defended the concept behind the new museum. The two Humboldt brothers, Willhelm the philosopher and his naturalist younger brother, Alexander, \u201csought to regard all cultures as of equal value\u201d, MacGregor has argued. \u201cThat is a pre-colonial view of the world which we would like to use fruitfully for the post-colonial era.\u201d MacGregor, whose Memories of a Nation exhibition about Germany enjoyed success in Britain and the country it takes as its subject, appears to be losing a more practical argument about the new exhibition space: he has called for admission to the Humboldt Forum to be free, as it is with the British Museum. But last month Berlin\u2019s culture senator, Klaus Lederer of the leftwing party Die Linke, ruled that permanent exhibitions inside the space would not be exempt from the entrance fees that Berlin museums charge Making the Humboldt Forum free for all, Lederer said, would have negatively affected smaller cultural events, such as youth and fringe theatres.",

      "bodyText": "The New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has said her government will \u201chold everyone to account\u201d over damage to a Sydney apartment complex, as authorities work to determine the root cause of persistent cracking within decade-old building. Residents of Sydney\u2019s Mascot Towers apartments complex have been left in limbo as engineers try to put an end to the cracking, which forced an evacuation on Friday. Berejiklian said on Sunday the government wants to \u201cget to the root cause\u201d and find out what has occurred. \u201cThere was some speculation it could have been from things that happened in the near vicinity but we need to find out the cause before we know how to act,\u201d she said. Asked if the NSW government would help displaced residents in the meantime, the premier said, \u201cWe\u2019re getting to the bottom of what happened.\u201d All 122 units and all but two ground-level shops of the decade-old Mascot Towers in Sydney\u2019s inner south were empty on Saturday and no advice has been given on when residents and businesses would be able to permanently return. On Sunday, owners and occupiers were told engineers had determined three access zones would be put in place for the next five to seven days. About half of all units would be partly accessible from Monday, so that residents, escorted by the building manager, could return for a short period of time to collect personal items. \u201cThereafter the engineer will advise if further monitoring or alternate and corrective action is required,\u201d an update said. Concerns had emerged about cracks in the building\u2019s primary support structure and facade masonry, prompting moves to install temporary structural support. Some residents were given about an hour to pack their things and evacuate. Labor MP for Heffron, Ron Hoenig, said he had been told there was no chance the evacuated complex would collapse. He also suggested residents might be out of the property for about a week. Initial investigations are expected to focus on a new apartment block that was recently built next door. \u201cIt\u2019s suspicious that the new building is not even occupied and the building that\u2019s been up for 12 years all of a sudden has substantial cracks,\u201d Hoenig said. Authorities said on Saturday that there had been \u201cidentifiable movements in the basement area\u201d, but no signs of any \u201cimmediate structural failures\u201d. The airport rail line and Mascot train station, which sits underneath the complex, had not been impacted. Renters have been informed their temporary accommodation will not be covered by insurance while owners\u2019 alternate housing may also not be covered. A temporary shelter is in place at the Sydney town hall. Residents and owners will receive a daily update email and have been told to contact the state\u2019s consumer watchdog if the are facing financial hardship. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit annoying to not really know what is going on and move at short notice but we\u2019ll deal with it,\u201d Mascot Towers tenant Jade told reporters on Saturday. Another tenant, who is now living nearby with a friend, said he was effectively homeless after being given 75 minutes to leave on Friday night. \u201cThe general thing going through my mind was \u2018what can I leave here and just go buy\u2019,\u201d tenant Cameron told AAP on Saturday. Engineers had been surveying the damage over weeks, but noticed a widening in the cracks on Thursday and Friday. The evacuation comes months after the Opal Tower debacle and with Sydney having experienced a decade-long apartments boom. In December, hundreds of residents had to be evacuated from the Opal Tower in Sydney\u2019s Olympic Park after a crack developed in a load-bearing concrete panel and the building shifted 2mm \u2013 causing plaster to crack and doors to stick in their frames. In February, an independent report found that multiple design and construction faults had led to damage at the Opal Tower. Engineers Australia said the situation was further evidence changes were needed in the building and construction sector. \u201cThe evacuation of Opal Tower was a major wake-up call for NSW to get serious about reform,\u201d spokesman Jonathan Russell said in a statement. \u201cIt is time to finally implement the changes agreed by Council of Australian Governments in response to its inquiry into regulation of the sector.\u201d In response to the Opal tower crisis, the NSW government announced plans to tighten building regulations and inspections. The premier said strata building policy was \u201calways a work in progress\u201d and \u201cof course\u201d more needs to be done. \u201cWe need to ensure their rights are protected, whether they\u2019re owners or whether they\u2019re tenants,\u201d she said. Berejiklian said she anticipated a new NSW Building Commissioner would be named in the \u201cvery near future\u201d. Guardian Australia has contacted Mascot Towers for comment.

You name it. \u201cLet me put it this way, I feel every shot I hit. I think that\u2019s always going to be the place from here going forward.\u201d Image of the day was provided by Stenson, who was pictured lying in the rough, next to a fan he had hit with a \u201csemi shank\u201d on the 16th. This was a typical act of decency from Stenson, who explained what happened after signing for his 70. \u201cHe\u2019s in good spirits because he\u2019s taking selfies of himself while he\u2019s down on the ground,\u201d Stenson said. \u201cI walk up to him. I said: \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 What else can you say? And he says: \u2018Can you do me one favour? Can I take a picture with you?\u2019 So next thing I\u2019m down on the ground as well, taking a picture, laying down with him and his girlfriend. \u201cIt feels like he\u2019s had maybe one or two refreshments that might have eased the pain. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s got a concussion but I asked for his details so I can contact him at a later date and check up on him. I might send him a couple of dozen balls or something to try to make up for my poor shot.\u201d",

That was a dramatic afternoon\u2019s play; if we have anything like a repeat tomorrow, when we make our way towards the business end, it\u2019s going to be a heck of a battle between Woodland and Rose.

But the dream eagle\u2019s not to be, his ball breaking to the right. Still, a birdie was the minimum requirement, and he\u2019s made it.

Up on 17, McIlroy finds sand with his 7-iron, and hits his escape a little bit thin. He\u2019ll need to sink a 25-footer coming back for his par. He can\u2019t make it.

And then he drains the 40-footer for his par save! This is astonishing! Look at this one of two ways: this is simply going to be Woodland\u2019s year, because his short game and steely nerve are the business! The other is that his tee-to-green game is beginning to fray, and there\u2019s only so often you can chip in or drain monster putts.

Long tipped for better things, without ever quite delivering, perhaps this is his time. <br> <strong>But of course there are still 36 holes to play. </strong>With plenty of big names lurking, much could, and probably will, change over the next few hours, as the 119th United States Open Championship takes proper shape. Buckle up, it\u2019s going to be one heck of a ride around a track that\u2019s expected to get a little harder - and therefore <em>harder</em> - over the weekend.

      "bodyText": "Rose wanders off looking very happy, a spring in his step. Woodland appears a little more pensive and trudges off with his hands in his pockets. Relaxed or downcast? Up to you. Either way, he\u2019s got plenty to think about as he goes into the final day of the US Open holding the 54-hole lead. That was a dramatic afternoon\u2019s play; if we have anything like a repeat tomorrow, when we make our way towards the business end, it\u2019s going to be a heck of a battle between Woodland and Rose. And some other big hitters, like Louis Oosthuizen, Rory McIlroy, Matt Kuchar and a certain Brooks Koepka, will want their say as well. Hope you can join us tomorrow. Nighty night! -11: Woodland -10: Rose -7: Koepka, Reavie, Oosthuizen -6: McIlroy -5: Kuchar, Hadley -4: Willett, McDowell, Rahm, Stenson, Wallace -3: An, Schauffele, Scott Woodland sends his putt a little too far out to the left, and it skims the side of the hole. He blows out hard, knowing that\u2019s a good chance spurned. Rose in fact has a ten-footer as well, and whether he\u2019s helped by a wag in the crowd yelling \u201cIt\u2019s straighter than it looks!\u201d is a question for another time. But it is straight, and in it goes! Birdie, and a 68. Woodland makes do with par for a 69. His lead has been halved today, but he\u2019s still in the box seat going into Sunday! Woodland\u2019s 106 yards from the flag. He screws a fine wedge to ten feet! A great chance for a closing birdie that\u2019d give him a round of 68. Then Rose takes a swish at his sand shot ... and out it comes, leaving a five-footer for his birdie and a round of 68. Two huge putts coming up here. Rose does indeed have a way into the green. He\u2019s 276 yards out, so out comes the fairway wood. He lashes it into the bunker guarding the front right of the green. His ball lands on the upslope, and he\u2019s got green to work with. All of which may explain why he\u2019s walking towards the green enjoying a good laugh with his caddie. Just the two players left out there: Gary Woodland and Justin Rose. Both send their tee shots at 18 towards the tree on the right, not wanting to take any chances with the rocks falling down to the Pacific on the left. Woodland ends up behind the tree, so he won\u2019t be able to launch one towards the green. He\u2019ll be laying up. Rose might have a route in, but we\u2019ll see about that for sure in a minute. Woodland draws one around the tree and he\u2019ll have a nice wedge in. Oosthuizen was going round with Aaron Wise today. The 22-year-old from Vegas had an absolute shocker: a 79 that included a quadruple-bogey eight at 9. He ends the day well down the standings at +3. Sepp Straka, who had been hovering around the top of the leader board during the first two days, also had a miserable time, shooting 76. He\u2019s +3 as well. But both young players will be better for the experience. Two putts for Woodland, and that\u2019s another par. He\u2019s still only made two bogeys all week! This is how you win US Opens. Meanwhile Rose\u2019s ball takes a little bobble as it comes off the face of his putter, and stays up on the right. And on 18, Oosthuizen lays up, then wedges in to 25 feet. But he can\u2019t guide the right-to-left curler in for birdie. Still, he makes his par, and he\u2019d have taken three under for the last four holes when he was standing on the 15th tee. He\u2019s right back in the mix! Rose caresses a lovely 6-iron straight at the flag on 17. He\u2019s ten feet away! Woodland finds the green too, but he\u2019s 35 feet away. Advantage Rose, you\u2019d have thought, but we\u2019ve been here before. Meanwhile it was a par for Chez Reavie at the last, and he signed for a marvellous 68. -11: Woodland (16) -9: Rose (16) -7: Koepka (F), Reavie (F), Oosthuizen (17) -6: McIlroy (F) -5: Kuchar (F), Hadley (F) -4: Willett (F), McDowell (F), Rahm (F), Stenson (F), Wallace (F) Rose shows his stones by getting up and down from the curly kale at the front of 17. He remains two off the lead, because Woodland fails to guide in his left-to-right breaker for birdie. Up on 18 - a hole Chesson Hadley had earlier bogeyed to finish with 70 on -5 - McIlroy arrows a stunning second from 220 yards to 20 feet. But the dream eagle\u2019s not to be, his ball breaking to the right. Still, a birdie was the minimum requirement, and he\u2019s made it. He signs for a 70, and at -6 a second US Open still isn\u2019t out of the question. But he\u2019ll most likely need the leaders to stumble. Par for Matt Kuchar down the last. He signs for a disappointing 70, having started so well. He\u2019s -5. But it\u2019s three birdies in a row for Louis Oosthuizen, who rolls in a 15-footer on 17! He\u2019s -7, having looked totally out of it an hour ago! Rose, in prime position in the centre of 16, lands his 9-iron a couple of yards short of the green. It snags in the thick stuff. Woodland spins his to 12 feet. Meanwhile on 18, McIlroy bangs a glorious drive down the middle, cutting the corner, the rocks, the Pacific Ocean, the lot. He\u2019ll be wanting birdie, dreaming of eagle. Woodland and Rose both hit safe irons down 16. Neither particularly long, but safety first. Henrik Stenson and Jon Rahm both finished with one-under 70s, by the way. They\u2019re -4, not totally out of it, but requiring both Woodland and Rose to lose their nerve spectacularly, at which point they can take their chances with the remainder of the field. -11: Woodland (15) -9: Rose (15) -7: Koepka (F), Reavie (17) -6: Hadley (17), Oosthuizen (16) -5: Kuchar (17), McIlroy (17) -4: Willett (F), McDowell (F), Rahm (F), Stenson (F), Wallace (F) Rose is just short of the 15th in two. His putt up is not Woodlandesque, kinking five feet to the left. But he holds his nerve to tidy up. His partner, the leader Woodland, has a great chance to extend his advantage at the top, but doesn\u2019t commit to a ten-footer for birdie and so par will have to do. Up on 17, McIlroy finds sand with his 7-iron, and hits his escape a little bit thin. He\u2019ll need to sink a 25-footer coming back for his par. He can\u2019t make it. He slips back to -5, where he started the day. So much for moving. What he\u2019d give for Matt Wallace\u2019s finish. Par for Reavie, though, and he remains in a tie for third at -7. Matt Wallace has struggled all day. But he drains a 35-foot eagle putt across 18, and suddenly a poor round has turned into an acceptable level-par 71. He\u2019s -4 going into Sunday. Meanwhile his playing partner Koepka takes two putts for his par, and that\u2019s a 68 to go with two 69s for the defending champ. He\u2019s -7. Back-to-back birdies for Louis Oosthuizen, at 15 and 16. He\u2019s salvaging his US Open bid at the end of his round. He\u2019s -6. But bother for Matt Kuchar on 17. He fluffs a chip and can\u2019t guide home a putt from the fringe. He slips to -5. And on 18, Koepka accepts the situation and quickly knocks a chip into the heart of the green but 40 feet from the flag, about the best he could do. This is going to be interesting for Brooks Koepka. The champ sends his drive at 18 towards the tree on the right. He\u2019s up close, but there\u2019s enough room for a full swing, and a route under the branches to the green. He opts to go for it ... and slices it to the right. He\u2019s short of the green, and it\u2019s not a great leave, because there\u2019s a bunker in the road, and branches of another tree overhanging it, so a simple chip is out of the question. Rose then knocks in his birdie putt from the fringe at the back! It\u2019s pretty much a replay of what happened at 12 in terms of narrative and dramatic rhythm. This is rollicking good fun, with both Woodland and Rose giving as good as they\u2019re getting, scrambling when they must, making the big birdies when they can. And it\u2019s only Saturday! Goodness know what tomorrow is going to bring. -11: Woodland (14) -9: Rose (14) -7: Koepka (17), Reavie (16) Woodland gets a huge break with his chip into the 14th. He seriously underhits it, but somehow the ball doesn\u2019t topple back off the false front. Had it done so, he\u2019d have been back on the fairway, snookered by the bunker like McIlroy was earlier. But his ball stays stubbornly stuck on the green. And then he drains the 40-footer for his par save! This is astonishing! Look at this one of two ways: this is simply going to be Woodland\u2019s year, because his short game and steely nerve are the business! The other is that his tee-to-green game is beginning to fray, and there\u2019s only so often you can chip in or drain monster putts. Take your pick. A how-did-that-stay-out moment on 17. A gorgeous tee shot by Koepka, pin high to 25 feet. He hits what looks like a perfect birdie putt, but it somehow lips out on the left while travelling at glacial speed. That really should have dropped. Gravity has done a number on Koepka there. He stays at -7. Real bother for Woodland at 14. His drive didn\u2019t finish in the bunker, but awfully tangled rough just beside. The grass turns his club over as he takes his second shot, and the ball disappears into awful stuff on the other side of the fairway. He\u2019s forced to hack out, and will need an up-and-down from 50 yards for his par. Meanwhile Rose is just off the back in three, close enough to the flag, on the fringe. And Kuchar hands back the shot he picked up at 15 within one hole. He\u2019s -6. Adam Scott has suffered since the turn, with bogeys at 11, 12 and 14. But he\u2019s just holed out from sand at the par-three 17th. He\u2019s -2. Some other admin: Francesco Molinari in with a level-par 71; he\u2019s -2. Xander Schauffele finished with a 71 as well; he\u2019s -3. Sergio limped home in par since we last heard from him, and that\u2019s a dismal 75; he\u2019s +1. And it was a 73 for Jordan Spieth; news of his recovery a little premature perhaps, and he\u2019s +1 too. ... something finally happens for Rory McIlroy! He sends his second shot at 15 from 160 yards to 12 feet, and rolls in the putt! The birdie takes him to within five of Woodland\u2019s lead ... and both Woodland and Rose have found sand with their tee shots at the par-five 13th. McIlroy permits himself a low-key air-punch in celebration. -11: Woodland (13) -8: Rose (13) -7: Koepka (16), Kuchar (15), Reavie (15) -6: McIlroy (15) G-Mac holes a monster across 18 for eagle! That means it\u2019s a round of 70 for the 2010 champion, and he\u2019s -4 going into the final day. Koepka is pin high at 16 in two. He\u2019ll have a look at birdie from 15 feet. But he can\u2019t make it. Birdie for Matt Kuchar at 15; he\u2019s -7. Woodland clips his chip from the front-left of the 13th to four feet, and tidies up for par. And he\u2019s got a three-stroke lead again, because Rose twitches over a five-footer and it\u2019s a miserable bogey. Before Woodland chipped in on 12, Rose was dreaming of getting to within one. Now all of a sudden he\u2019s three behind again. Leader board coming up next, because ... Woodland\u2019s tee shot at 13 finds the tangled nonsense down the right. His second squirts left, and nearly ends up in the bunker guarding the green, but stops just short. It\u2019s in the rough, but sitting up. Rose meanwhile is short of the green in two, but on the fairway. This US Open is turning into a bit of a grind now ... and it\u2019s wonderful entertainment! Compare and contrast. After the wonder chips by Woodland and Koepka, McIlroy - in the bunker to the right of the 14th green in two - hits a fat splash. His ball only just gets out of the sand, then curls all the way back off the false front of the green, and now he\u2019s faced with a big up-and-down to stay at -5. Which he does, nearly chipping in himself for birdie, but there\u2019s to be no celebration for McIlroy. That\u2019s a really poor way to pass on a good chance for birdie, despite the fact he nearly salvaged it with his wedge. Woodland chips in! A cute little clack of the wedge, and his ball serenely rolls along a right-to-left route and into the cup! What a par save! And suddenly Rose\u2019s nine-foot putt looks twice as long! He makes it, though, refusing to allow Woodland\u2019s escape affect him. A broad smile, and he\u2019s closed the gap at the top! But if Woodland\u2019s par isn\u2019t ludicrous enough, up on 15 Koepka trundles his chip across the green and into the cup to stay at -7! Difficult to say who\u2019s happier of the three, though Rose is the one who\u2019s made material gain. -11: Woodland (12) -9: Rose (12) -7: Koepka (15), Reavie (13) -6: Kuchar (14) Woodland\u2019s in a hell of a bind. His ball is plugged in the face of the bunker, but not in the sand. He\u2019s forced to stand three feet below in the trap, grip down, and stab his ball out sideways. And he slightly overcooks it, his ball squirting into the rough on the other side of the green. And there\u2019s similar trouble for the champ Koepka on 15, as his wedge out of the awful rough to the side of the green flies through the dancefloor and into more cabbage. Meanwhile eagle-eyed readers will have noticed that Koepka didn\u2019t make birdie at the par-five 14th after his blootered drive. Having laid up with his second, he wedged to 15 feet but didn\u2019t make the putt. And now he\u2019s just pulled his approach into deep filth to the left of the 15th green. There could be some change afoot at the top soon. Woodland\u2019s tee shot at 12 snags the thick stuff surrounding the bunker at the front of the green. Rose responds by whipping a 5-iron into the front-right portion of the green ... and he gets a very fortunate bounce, as the ball leaps forward and lands on a slope that gathers his ball towards the hole. He\u2019ll have a great look at birdie from ten feet, while his partner has some trouble to be dealing with. Reavie rolls in a putt from off the front of 13! That\u2019s back-to-back birdies. That was a perfect read. Reavie, from Wichita, a lineman. He\u2019s -7. But he\u2019s still four off the lead, because Woodland taps in from three feet for birdie at 11. Rose couldn\u2019t guide in a seven-foot curler for his birdie, and there\u2019s significant separation at the top again. -11: Woodland (11) -8: Rose (11) -7: Koepka (14), Reavie (13) Speaking of Spanish capitulations, Jon Rahm bogeyed 10, 11 and 13, and all looked lost. But he\u2019s just carded back-to-back birdies at 14 and 15, and he\u2019s level par for an, ahem, adventurous round. At -3 he\u2019s a little too far back you\u2019d have thought, unless both Woodland and Rose unravel. But both have gone close at 11, Woodland especially, so Rahm shouldn\u2019t hold his breath. A slightly disappointing 72 for Matt Fitzpatrick. The young Sheffield star posted a couple of early birdies, but suffered mid-round, with bogeys at 8, 9, 10 and 13. A birdie at 14 salvaged his score a little, and despite it all he\u2019s still in red figures at the US Open, a state of affairs that should never be sniffed at. Meanwhile you might be wondering why I\u2019ve been ignoring Sergio today. Bogeys at 1, 4, 5, 8 and 9 are why I\u2019ve been doing that. He\u2019s since picked up one shot at 13, but through 16 holes he\u2019s four over for his round and +1. Ah well, at least he made his first cut at a major since 2017. Oh Sergio! Chez Reavie makes a 15-footer on 12 for birdie. He\u2019s ticking along without fuss, and is only four off the lead at -6. Another par for McIlroy who remains at -5. Oosthuizen can\u2019t get up and down from sand at 11 and slips to -4. A drama-free par for Woodland at 10. And Rose makes his 30th one-putt of the week, scrambling par to stay within two of his playing partner. -10: Woodland (10) -8: Rose (10) -7: Koepka (13) -6: Kuchar (12), Hadley (12), Reavie (12) -5: McIlroy (12) -4: Willett (F), Stenson (14), Oosthuizen (11) Dustin Johnson is in with a level-par 71. Pebble Beach isn\u2019t going to pay him back for the carnage of 2010. He\u2019s -2, having moved not a jot today. Meanwhile Brooks Koepka, having made his way through perhaps the hardest stretch at Pebble Beach without a misstep, opens his shoulders on the par-five 14th and clatters a monster drive down the track. McIlroy is in danger of dropping a stroke at 11, finding himself snagged on a bank to the right of the green. He can\u2019t get particularly close with his bump down. But he rolls in the seven footer coming back to save his par. Nothing\u2019s happening today for the 2011 winner at all, but there are always patches like this, there\u2019s a long way to go, and at least he\u2019s hanging in there. Brandon Wu is in with his second 71 of the week. Filed alongside yesterday\u2019s wonderful 69, the 22-year-old Californian is leading the race for low amateur. At -2, he\u2019s a couple of shots ahead of Viktor Hovland, who you\u2019ll remember getting as high as -4 on Thursday. A further two shots back, it\u2019s Chandler Eaton at +2. And it\u2019s safe to say Michael Thorbjornsen is out of contention after an unfortunate 84 today; he\u2019s +15. But at 17, he\u2019ll just be thrilled to have made it to the weekend. Plenty of big-name pros didn\u2019t. One of the shots of the day by Chesson Hadley, who fires his approach at 11 over the flag, landing his ball at the back of the green and spinning it 30 feet back to seven feet. But he can\u2019t reward himself by converting the birdie chance. He stays at -6. Rose meanwhile remains at -8 after doing extremely well to get up and down from a tight lie to the left of the green. He does pretty well to get within eight feet, then pokes in a right-to-left curler to scramble his par. Woodland makes a fairly fuss-free par. Koepka opts to putt, and lags a long one from 60 to three feet. That\u2019s a great save. The champion is three under for his round today, the best of anyone in the top ten bar the long-finished Danny Willett - who had been playing in slightly more favourable conditions. That could prove a significant trend. He stays at -7. McIlroy lets another 15-foot birdie putt dribble by, this time at 10. Shades of DJ yesterday, who let so many chances slide. Rory remains at -5. He looks dejected, but he\u2019s still only five off the lead, and there\u2019s still so much golf to play. Meanwhile Koepka hits a 6-iron into the par-three 12th, but either it gets caught up in the wind (which is picking up a little bit, albeit in unpredictable spasms) or he\u2019s under-clubbed. Whatever, he\u2019s short of the green and looking totally radged off as a result. Woodland drops his first shot since the 9th hole on Thursday. Only his second bogey of the week. He totally misreads his putt from the fringe at the back of 8, sending it miles to the right, expecting a right-angle snap when it was more of a gentle slider. That leaves him with a tricky six-footer across the green, and he can\u2019t save himself. Meanwhile in true match-play fashion, Rose strokes his birdie putt straight into the cup. And suddenly a four-shot lead is only two! It\u2019ll be fascinating to see how Woodland responds to his first setback for 48 hours. -10: Woodland (8) -8: Rose (8) -7: Koepka (11) -6: Kuchar (10), Hadley (10) -5: Reavie (9), McIlroy (9), Oosthuizen (8) -4: Willett (F), Stenson (12) A wild tee shot by Koepka on 11. But his power enables him to force his ball greenwards, when most would leave it well short. He\u2019s inches off the back, and cradles a putt from the fringe to tap-in distance. What an escape! He stays at -7. \u201cI suspect you\u2019re right, Scott,\u201d is the perfect start to email correspondence, as employed here by Simon McMahon. \u201cMickelson is fated never to win the US Open. Being about as far from an elite sportsman as it\u2019s possible to be, I\u2019ve no great insight into this, but I imagine he won\u2019t give it up easily, a bit like Jimmy White still thinks he can win the World Snooker Championship cos he made a century in practice, or Dundee United think they\u2019ll win Big Cup cos they beat Arbroath in a pre-season friendly. Sport really is a metaphor for life, or vice versa, or something, eh?\u201d Probably more for us than him. After all, he\u2019s got the Masters, the Open and the PGA in the bag. And if missing out on a US Open is good enough for Sam Snead, it should be good enough for Lefty. Chez Reavie makes a sensational par save on 9, curling in a downhill right-to-left putt from 30 feet. He stays at -5. Par for McIlroy, a 15-foot birdie effort sliding by on the low side. He turns in level-par 35. Back on 8, Rose arrows his own shot of the day, a 5-iron straight at the flag. He\u2019ll have a look at birdie from 15 feet on this exceptionally difficult hole. Woodland\u2019s second, a 7-iron pushed a little to the right, takes a lucky bounce off the hood of a bunker and kicks towards the green. He\u2019ll have two putts from the fringe at the back for par - but that could have gone anywhere. Sand and a penalty area to the right. A garden-variety par for Woodland on 7. Rose leaves himself a testing par saver from five feet, having raced a 40-foot birdie effort by. He can\u2019t miss this one coming back, for the sake of his confidence more than anything else. And he doesn\u2019t. No three-putts for Rose this week. Meanwhile Oosthuizen drops back to -5, having found that tricky bank by the side of 8. And on 9, Kuchar yips a tiddler for par and sends the ball four feet past! Oh dear. He does very well to gather himself and knock the one coming back in for bogey. But that\u2019s two shots gone in two holes. Meanwhile Gary Woodland clatters a fine tee shot down 8, but there\u2019s an ominous rumble coming from behind ... it\u2019s Brooks Koepka, who birdies 10 after stroking his second to eight feet, and moves into a share of second spot! -11: Woodland (7) -7: Koepka (10), Rose (7) -6: Kuchar (9), Hadley (9) Gary Woodland gets up and down from a greenside bunker at the par-five 6th, and he\u2019s extended his lead to four. We\u2019re getting to the point where the chasing pack need him to slip up and offer them some hope ... but he\u2019s only dropped one stroke this week! Justin Rose meanwhile has to make do with par after his approach finds an awful lie to the right of the dancefloor. Meanwhile Chez Reavie sends his second into the tousled bank to the left of 8, and the result is a shot dropped. He\u2019s back to -5. -11: Woodland (6) -7: Kuchar (8), Rose (6) -6: Koepka (9), Hadley (8), Oosthuizen (7) -5: Reavie (8), McIlroy (8) Wallace can only bash his ball into the heart of 9. He\u2019s 30 feet past the flag, though. Two putts, but that\u2019s a double bogey. He\u2019s out in 38, having clattered down the standings to -1. But a no-fuss par for his partner Koepka, who reaches the turn in a blemish-free 33. He\u2019s -6. Par for McIlroy at 8: he stays at -5. And Phil Mickelson ends his round with a triple-bogey eight. It\u2019s a 75, he\u2019s +3, and the career slam\u2019s just not going to happen, is it. Matt Wallace\u2019s round is threatening to unravel. Having bogeyed 8, he\u2019s only one over today. But his tee shot at 9 finds thick oomska down the left, and his attempt to gouge out flies straight left, and he\u2019s in even worse trouble now. He pinches the bridge of his nose in an attempt to keep calm. He\u2019s currently -3 but won\u2019t stay there long. Meanwhile Jon Rahm nearly extricates himself from trouble at 10, chipping from a tight spot on the right to ten feet. But he shoves the par saver and slips back to -4. Matt Kuchar does very well to bundle his ball from the thick grass to a couple of feet. He\u2019ll escape with just a bogey. But that means Gary Woodland now has a three-stroke lead ... and he\u2019s just cracked a fine driving iron down the par-five 6th. He\u2019s looking calm and composed today. Meanwhile back-to-back birdies for Xander Schauffele, at 10 and 11, have brought the 25-year-old Californian back into this tournament. And the 2016 Open champ Henrik Stenson isn\u2019t out of this, reaching the turn in 34. -10: Woodland (5) -7: Kuchar (7), Rose (5) -6: Koepka (8), Hadley (7), Reavie (7), Oosthuizen (6) -5: Rahm (9), McIlroy (7) -4: Willett (F), Furyk (12), Schauffele (11), Stenson (9), Wise (6) Kuchar sends his second at the troublesome 8 high onto the bank to the left of the green. He\u2019s facing an almost impossible chip down, and sure enough it flies through the green and into thick stuff on the other side. He\u2019d take a bogey now and run. Meanwhile birdie for Oosthuizen at 6, and he\u2019s back to -6. In attempting to gently splash out of the bunker, Rose suffers a full-blown shank. Off the hosel. The ball squirts to the right and snags in the rough stuff just over the bunker. He nips his third shot close, but that\u2019ll be a bogey. Woodland manages to splash out to ten feet, and makes the saver to remain at -10. Meanwhile Chez Reavie - after decent finishes at the last two PGAs - makes birdie at 6 and 7 to rise to -6. Rose is having to fight his game tee to green. He shoves his tee shot at the par-three 5th into the bunker on the right. He\u2019s going to be short-sided from there. And Woodland follows him in! Trouble for the pair there. Before Woodland can tidy up for his birdie, his partner Rose gets up and down from greenside sand. So the final group both pick up a shot. Quite a few of the leading pack making hay over the first seven holes, where the scorin\u2019 is good. -10: Woodland (4) -8: Kuchar (7), Rose (4) -6: Koepka (7), Hadley (7) -5: Rahm (8), Reavie (6), McIlroy (6), Oosthuizen (5) Woodland looks to be in a little trouble on 4, his perfect tee shot having found a massive divot. His wedge in will surely be difficult to control. But he somehow slams the brakes on right by the flag, and he\u2019ll surely be converting that for his first birdie of the day. Meanwhile birdie for McIlroy at 6, and he\u2019s back where he started the day at -5. And another birdie for Matt Kuchar, this time at 7, and folk are finally starting to make their moves on Moving Day! Thanks to Rob. Back just in time for some top eagle action. Matt Kuchar and Chesson Hadley have just played the par-five 6th in a combined total of six strokes. Two stunning second shots, two eagles! Kuchar\u2019s presence here is no surprise; he\u2019s so often involved at the business end of the majors. But Hadley, a 31-year-old from North Carolina, has no track record in the majors whatsoever. What\u2019s more, he\u2019s missed six of his last seven cuts! Meanwhile it\u2019s back-to-back birdies for Brooks Koepka, who follows up 6 with a 20-footer at 7. All told, the top of the leader board suddenly looks a whole lot different. -9: Woodland (3) -7: Kuchar (6), Rose (3) -6: Koepka (7), Hadley (6) -5: Rahm (8), Oosthuizen (5) The Americans are coming; Jim Furyk and Matt Kuchar to be precise. A birdie for Furyk at the ninth gets him t0 -4, two under on the day, while Kuchar is now at -5 after gaining a shot at the 4th. He\u2019s joint fourth, with the menacing Koepka, who has just birdied 6 and is beginning to relish these grimy conditions. Tiger finishes with a birdie at 18 for a 71 and he will go into the final round at level par. And with that I\u2019ll return you to the comforting arms of Scott Murray. Thanks for your time. Bye. Woods produces some magic on 16 to grab a birdie from a long way away on the green. The putt is sensational but it\u2019s all been a bit of a mess today. That\u2019s his fourth birdie but five bogeys have checked his progress and are stymying any continuation of his fairytale comeback. For now. He\u2019s +1 , but he\u2019s TIger. Danny Willett is in the bunker on 18. It\u2019s not an awful position though, or lie for that matter, and he produces a fine sand wedge to leave himself a short putt for par. He rolls that in without drama and that is a 67 for the Englishman and the round of the day. He\u2019s the clubhouse leader on -4 and remarkably is currently in a tie for fifth. Well played that man. And immediately he\u2019s giving an interview \u2026 It was really good. I got off to a hot start and came in really strong down the last few. It\u2019s pretty windy out there but you\u2019ve got to get out quick, hang on through the middle and come home strong. Them leaders would probably bite you hand off for level par or -1 with the position they\u2019re in. If someone is double figures under par at the end of the day I think they\u2019ll be leading Gary Woodland and Justin Rose are on the first tee, and they\u2019ll be pleased nobody has jumped out of the pack at them so far. Rose drifts his iron into the rough on the right. Woodland, who has only made one bogey in this tournament so far, follows him in there. Up on the 1st green Oosthuizen holes a long one to save par while McIlroy misses his birdie putt to the right on 2. Thanks as always Scott. Things are looking tough out there but Mickelson is a fighter and snares a fine birdie two at 12 to return to -2. That was on the back of a bogey at 11 for the big man who keeps on coming, whatever the course throws at him. Koepka passes up a birdie chance at 3 but rattles in the par saver to suggest he\u2019s in the mood to move. Rory punches his third into the green, but from that position there\u2019s no control, and his ball dribbles off the back of the putting surface. He\u2019s left with a 40-footer from the fringe for his par. Bogey is the realistic target now, of course, and he does pretty well to pop a putt, the even longer grass hampering his back-stroke, to six feet. But he really needs that bogey putt to go in. It does. He\u2019s -4. Meanwhile Mickelson creams a tee shot at the par-three 12th to 12 inches. He\u2019ll be back to -2 unless he has one of his infamous rushes of blood from close range. And with that, I\u2019m taking a break. Rob Bleaney will look after you, and I\u2019ll see you again soon. McIlroy is making a mess of this opening hole. He gouges out of the rough on the right ... and sends his ball into the equally thick rubbish down the other side. He\u2019ll have fancied a quick start, but this is no good. Meanwhile birdie for Tiger at 14, after he nearly holed out for eagle with his wedge; he\u2019s +1. Koepka curls in his par saver! That is quite absurd given the trouble he found off the tee. He stays at -4. But his partner Matt Wallace can\u2019t perform a similar feat of escapology after a loose tee shot, and he\u2019s -3. Meanwhile a bogey for Mickelson at 11; he slips back to -1. And Rory\u2019s out and about, but he\u2019s already in bother, pushing his iron off the 1st tee into the rough down the right. Trouble for the defending champ on 2. Koepka sprays his drive into thick stuff down the right. That ball disappeared. This is going to be interesting, on a monster par four. He gouges out, then sends a wedge biting 15 feet past the flag. He\u2019ll have a putt with a lot of movement for par. Not ideal, but after that drive, to even have a chance of saving par has been some effort. Meanwhile par for Fitzpatrick on 3, though he nearly drained a 40-footer for birdie from the back of the green. Willett goes close to another birdie at 15, but his effort from 20 feet shaves the lip. Birdie for Jon Rahm at 3, though, to cancel out a dropped shot at 2. He\u2019s -3. Xander Schauffele has been erratic over the opening four holes, to say the least. After that aforementioned double at 1, he dropped another at 2, then birdied 3. Finally he\u2019s threaded his drive at 4 through the small entrance to the green, nearly hitting the flagstick. Had that happened, we could have had a hole-in-one albatross on our hands! But the ball scampered past, towards the back of the green. Two putts later, and that\u2019s another birdie. He\u2019s one over for his round today, but at -2 overall, at least on the way back. A little frustration for Brooks Koepka, too. He strokes his second at 1 to 15 feet, but his straight uphill birdie putt stops one dimple short of an opening birdie. And apologies, but there was some misinformation flying around regarding Fitzpatrick\u2019s shot into the par-five 6th. It was his third, not his second, after a poor tee shot. So the 20-footer was for birdie, not eagle. And he didn\u2019t make it. So he stays at -4. Bah. It hurt me just as much as it hurt you. News of Rickie Fowler, who is in with a disappointing 71. He was three under for his round after 7, then was an inch away from holing out from sand at 8, but that near miss took the wind out of his sail. Bogeys at 9, 10 and 15 knocked him back to +1, and the frown that accompanied a near miss for birdie at the last tells the story. His major-championship frustration continues. DJ bounces back with birdie at the par-five 6th. He\u2019ll be slightly disappointed, nonetheless, having lashed his second from 225 yards to 15 feet. But he doesn\u2019t quite hit his eagle putt, which dies off to the right at the last. He\u2019s -4. Birdie for Danny Willett at 14, and he\u2019s -3 again, having weathered his mid-round storm. And coming behind Dustin is Matt Fitzpatrick, who clacks a gorgeous fairway wood into the green like the big man before him. He\u2019ll have a look at an eagle putt from about 20 feet that\u2019d take him to within three of the lead! Bogey for Tiger at 12. He\u2019s +2, his race is run, if it wasn\u2019t already, long ago. Meanwhile Nate Lashley is going along nicely, following up birdie at 1 with another at 6. The 36-year-old debutant - whose tragic backstory is briefly told here - is -3 overall. Meanwhile on the first tee, it\u2019s Brooks Koepka, who whips his opening iron down the fairway. He\u2019ll be going round today with Matt Wallace, the young English prospect\u2019s chops up after tie for third at Bethpage Black last month. Back-to-back birdies for Francesco Molinari! He follows up one at 3 by nearly backspinning a wedge from 100 yards into the cup at 4. He rises to -4 for the tournament. He\u2019ll be ruing that double-bogey/bogey finish at 8 and 9 yesterday, though the amount of absurd par saves he made earlier in the round may ensure he stays philosophical about the whole enterprise. Matt Fitzpatrick joins him at -4 by going extremely close with his tee shot at the par-three 5th, knocking in a short putt for his second birdie of the day. But DJ\u2019s going the other way, after finding the bunker to the right of 5. He\u2019s -3 again. -9: Woodland -7: Rose -6: Oosthuizen -5: Wise, McIlroy -4: Fitzpatrick (5), Molinari (4), Reavie, Hadley, Kuchar, Koepka, Wallace You have got to love Patrick Reed. He\u2019s totally unrepentant for his club-snapping antics of yesterday. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything to the golf course, I didn\u2019t say obscenities or anything like that. It was a split second, I moved on and did my business, hit my next golf shot.\u201d Ewan Murray reports. The wind\u2019s up a little today and, surprise surprise, the links are playing much tougher. Nobody\u2019s made a charge towards the top of the leaderboar... er, hold on! Here comes the big man! Dustin follows up his birdie at 3 by wedging from 70 yards at the short par-four to seven feet, then rolling in the putt. He\u2019s -4! If his putter is hot today, we could be in for something special, because the rest of his game looked in super nick yesterday. Imagine if he managed to lift the famous old trophy tomorrow, a fairytale end to his 2010 nightmare. There wouldn\u2019t be a dry eye in the house. -9: Woodland -7: Rose -6: Oosthuizen -5: Wise, McIlroy -4: D Johnson (4), Reavie, Hadley, Kuchar, Koepka, Wallace Xander Schauffele looks like a major champion in waiting. The 25-year-old from San Diego has only made nine previous starts in the majors, but already has second-placed finishes at the Open and the Masters to his name, plus fifth and sixth-placed finishes at his two US Open appearances. He\u2019s got the game for the big occasion. But this one might be beyond him. All looked fine and dandy after his opening round of 66, but yesterday\u2019s 73 was a slog, and he\u2019s opened up today by careering down the 1st like the Keystone Kops. A double-bogey after visiting the rough on both sides of the hole, plus a greenside bunker, and he\u2019s crashed down to +1. Here\u2019s a little upwardly mobile action, though. Birdie for the 2016 champ Dustin Johnson, who rattles in a 20-footer at 3. He\u2019s -3, and really should be a few shots better off, because he played very well yesterday tee to green, but his flat stick did a number on him coming home. I lost count of the short birdie putts he missed. He\u2019s only six behind, and if the big man can get something going ... well, he may feel Pebble Beach owes him big-style after his notorious Sunday meltdown in 2010. And a birdie for Lefty at 6, the first splash of red colour on his card today. He\u2019s -2. It all goes wrong quicksmart for Hideki Matsuyama. He finds deep rough down the left of 11, then more thick stuff on the other side of the track. Throw in a missed short putt, and that\u2019s a double bogey that sends him crashing down to -1. Only one of the early starters has got as high as -4, and Danny Willett couldn\u2019t stay there. The leading pack will be satisfied with the way this is panning out. Tiger pulls a straight 15-foot birdie putt to the left of the cup at 9. He swishes his putter through the air in great irritation. He tidies up for par, and he\u2019s turning in 36. He\u2019s +1 for his round and the tournament. Meanwhile birdie for Matt Fitzpatrick at 2, and the young Englishman is -3. A nice run by Paul Casey! The 41-year-old Englishman bogeyed 2 and 3, but he\u2019s responded with birdies at 4, 6 and now 7, the latest the reward for a monster putt from the back of the green, An Byeong-hun territory. He\u2019s -1. Meanwhile Hideki Matsuyama repairs the damage of bogey at 9 with birdie at 10 to return to -3. But Danny Willett can\u2019t repeat the trick. Another wild tee shot, and after hacking his way up the left of the 10th, it\u2019s back-to-back bogeys. There goes that momentum! He slips back to -2. Patrick Cantlay was the hipster-tipster\u2019s choice this week. No wonder: he\u2019d just won the Memorial Tournament at Muirfield Village, a victory that came off the back of a top-ten finish at the Masters and a tie for third at last month\u2019s PGA. An opening-day 73 meant he was off the pace from the get-go, and yesterday\u2019s 71 didn\u2019t really address that. The 27-year-old Californian only just made the cut. But he\u2019s finally made a significant move up the leader board today. A fine 68, after coming home with birdies at 13, 16 and 17, have taken him to -1 for the tournament. That\u2019s the round of the day so far. He\u2019s just outside the top 30 right now, but with the wind picking up a little, and the greens likely to get a touch harder as a result, he might find himself in a better position come the end of the day. Nothing\u2019s happening for Phil Mickelson. He\u2019s parred the first five holes, having left most of his birdie attempts well short. The putter not his friend today. He remains at -1. Tiger meanwhile stays +1 after par at 8. He had a good run at a 20-foot birdie putt, but it didn\u2019t drop and right now he\u2019s a study in frustration. Bogey for Matsuyama at 9, and he reaches the turn in 33. He\u2019s -2. Then coming behind, Willett drops his first stroke of the day, the result of sending his tee shot into the second cut down the left. He gives himself a chance to escape with par, clipping his third to 15 feet, but he can\u2019t make the putt. Bogey, but he\u2019s turned round in 32, a figure he\u2019d have grasped with both hands when teeing it up at 1. Tiger\u2019s left with a 40-footer down the 7th green. He nearly makes it, of course. Then his three-footer for par horseshoes out. Oh dear. A rush of blood there, hit far too hard. That\u2019s the easiest stretch of the course finished with, and he\u2019s gone backwards. He\u2019s +1, and the title\u2019s pipe-dream territory now. His partner An Byeong-hun shows the way to go, following up birdie at 6 with another at 7, thanks to a tramliner from the back of the green. He\u2019s -2. Tiger\u2019s just off the front of the par-five 6th in two. This would be a good time to do something outrageous. He opts for putter instead of wedge, and leaves his 60-footer a good seven feet short. It costs him, because he shoves his birdie putt wide right, and that\u2019s a great opportunity to move into red figures spurned. He very nearly flies the green at the 98-yard 7th, too, so it looks like another chance to pick up a stroke has gone. Willett however gets up and down magnificently from the bank to the side of 8, and keeps his card blemish-free. He stays at -4. A chance for Matsuyama to join Willett at -4. He swishes a fine second across the cliffs and into the treacherous 8th green. He\u2019s left himself a ten-foot putt for birdie ... but he can\u2019t nail it. He remains at -3. Mind you, how long Willett, in the group behind, stays at -4 is a good question, because he\u2019s tugged a 6-iron from the centre of the 8th fairway to the really thick stuff to the left of the green. His ball\u2019s disappeared into that nonsense. And it\u2019s a downhill lie. Good luck Danny! Danny Willett is flying! He clips his tee shot at the teeny-tiny 7th - playing at just 98 yards today - to 12 feet. The downhill putt he\u2019s left with is a gentle right-to-left slider, but he judges it perfectly and he\u2019s -4 now. Worthy of today\u2019s first updated leader board, I\u2019m arguing. -9: Woodland -7: Rose -6: Oosthuizen -5: Wise, McIlroy -4: Willett (7), Reavie, Hadley, Kuchar, Koepka, Wallace And another birdie for Tiger! He sends his tee shot into the centre of the par-three 5th. A straight uphill putt from 25 feet is always dropping, on an inevitable journey from the second it left the face of his flat stick. He\u2019s repaired the damage of the first three holes in short order. He\u2019s back to level par. Another birdie for Danny Willett, who creamed a fairway wood into the front of the par-five 6th, the ball breaking right towards the hole and stopping 20 feet short. His eagle putt shaved the right of the cup; he\u2019s -3 for both his round and the tournament. He\u2019s going round with his pal and compatriot Luke Donald; the former number one sees his eagle effort, set up after a similarly lovely fairway wood sent scampering into the green, stop one dimple short. Donald\u2019s +1, slowly piecing his career back together after injury. Three birdies in a row for Hideki Matsuyama, at 4, 5 and 6. The Japanese superstar, still chasing that elusive major, having tied for second a couple of years ago at Erin Hills, is -3. Tiger meanwhile chips close at 4, and tidies up from five feet for a desperately needed birdie. He\u2019s back to +1. A closing bogey for Tyrrell Hatton, the result of a wayward drive into sand down the right. He signs for a 69. He was rubbing his wrist gingerly after blasting out of that fairway bunker. Hopefully nothing serious, as at level par for the tournament, he\u2019s nicely placed for a very respectable finish tomorrow. He\u2019d been going round with one of the pre-tournament hot tips, Tommy Fleetwood, but Southport\u2019s finest has never really got going this week. A 73, to go with his 71-73 weekday work. He\u2019s +4. It\u2019s all going badly wrong for Tiger. He finds greenside sand at 3, and is forced to play away from the pin, such is his awkward position. He splashes to the heart of the green, then races his long, long, long par putt five feet past. He makes the one coming back, but that\u2019s two bogeys in the first three holes, a start he could barely afford. He\u2019s +2. As for America\u2019s other romantic choices? Rickie Fowler drops his first shot of the day at 9, though he still turns in 33; he\u2019s -1. And career-slam-chasing Phil Mickelson, from the centre of the fairway at 1, allows his approach to topple back off the front of the green. He\u2019s left with a 40-foot putt. He leaves it a couple of turns short, but will at least escape with par, remaining at -1. The post-Augusta comedown suffered by the 2016 Masters champion Danny Willett has been well documented, so there\u2019s no need to go into all that again here. But he\u2019s slowly making his way back. A win in Dubai last November, and this could be his best showing in a major since, well, you know. Birdies at 1 and 3, and he seems to be carrying himself with a little more confidence this week. It\u2019s lovely to see. And at -2, he\u2019s currently inside the top 20. Here\u2019s to the 31-year-old from Sheffield keeping it going. Rory Sabbatini is having quite the spectacular week. On Thursday, he became the first representative of Slovakia to make a hole-in-one in major-championship golf, acing the 12th. He\u2019s also got his eye in today. Having just hold a big curling putt from the fringe at 4, he rolls in a chip from distance across 5. Back-to-back birdies, and he\u2019s level par. Meanwhile news of the aforementioned Rhys Enoch: he\u2019s in with a third-round 71, and is, for what this is worth at this super-early stage, the clubhouse leader at +2. Tiger thinks the jig is up? No, no, he\u2019s not hard-wired like that, is he. From the centre of the 2nd fairway, he sends a long iron into the green, using the bank on the right to send his ball rolling left towards the cup. That\u2019s gorgeous. He\u2019ll be left with a ten-footer for bounce-back birdie. But he leaves the putt high on the right. Off he storms in the frustrated style. Meanwhile Rickie Fowler has clearly come out with an all-guns-blazing attitude. He\u2019s so unlucky not to hole out from the bunker to the right of the 8th green, his ball smacking the pin and stubbornly staying on the lip. Still, he\u2019ll tap in for par, and he remains at -2. \u201c$&amp;*!\u201d Tiger performs one of the curse words in the style of Brian Blessed on the 1st green. A baritone boom that rings around Pebble Beach, his reaction to a dropped shot on the opening hole. He\u2019d failed to give his chip in enough oomph, and the remaining putt was always a big ask. He slips to +1, and is now ten behind with 35 holes left to play. A suggestion that he knows the jig is now up, if it wasn\u2019t already. Meanwhile Hatton is this close to chipping in from sand at 17. He\u2019ll save his par. The 27-year-old from High Wycombe seems to enjoy the grind of a US Open. Another birdie for Tyrrell Hatton! He\u2019s going along very nicely today. Birdies at 3, 6, 7 and now 15, offset by a single bogey at 5. Three under for his round and -1 overall. Easy to forget that Hatton tied for sixth last year at Shinnecock Hills, given all the final-round noise surrounding Tommy Fleetwood\u2019s 63 and Brooks Koepka retaining his crown. Meanwhile Rickie Fowler is doing just as well: more birdies, at 6 and now the tiny 98-yard par-three 7th, where he rolled in a 40-footer. He\u2019s suddenly -2 overall and must be wondering what the heck happened yesterday. Here comes Tiger! He starts the day at level par for the championship. Nine behind the leader Gary Woodland. Probably too far back, especially on a US Open course where you can\u2019t take too many liberties in chasing a low score. Then again, Lou Graham was 11 shots behind leader Tom Watson at the halfway stage of the 1975 Open, and went on to win his only major at Medinah. So nothing\u2019s impossible yet. However, flaying an iron off the 1st tee into the deep stuff down the left isn\u2019t an ideal start. He does pretty well to gouge back out to the fairway; he\u2019ll have to get up and down from 50 yards or so to save his par. So yesterday afternoon, Patrick Reed fluffed a chip and then did this ... Yes, yes, won\u2019t somebody think of the kids, etc. But let\u2019s face it, we\u2019ve all wanted to do that at some point in our lives. Is it as spectacular as Rory McIlroy\u2019s helicopter fling into the deep blue at Doral? Rory\u2019s meltdown was more measured and elegant, but hats off to Reed for the decisiveness of the act, all executed quickly, crisply, cleanly and without fuss. A bit like Withnail taking care of the live chicken at Uncle Monty\u2019s cottage. Also, his calm disposing of the bits and the way his caddie simply handed him another club, the pair getting on with business as though nothing out of the ordinary had happened, was a nicely paced comic conclusion to the scene. Role model: 0/10. Entertainer: 10/10. Anyway, whether he\u2019s in a better frame of mind today is a moot point: he\u2019s three over for his round through 16. He\u2019s +5 overall. Some early movement towards the bottom of the leader board. Tyrrell Hatton was out in 33, and has been parring his way along since. He\u2019s two under for his round through 14 and level par overall. Canadian Nick Taylor, the low amateur in this tournament way back in 2009 at Bethpage Black, has just birdied 11 and 13; he\u2019s two under today and level par for the championship. And Marcus Kinhult is the third player out there who has made it to two under for his round; the 22-year-old Swede, the current British Masters champ, is level par on his US Open debut. Rickie Fowler was leading this tournament after the morning wave on Thursday. A fine opening 66, but once again the prospect of that elusive major-championship victory proved to be one great tease. Having started slowly yesterday with a couple of bogeys, he looked pretty emotional when he then sailed a shot from the centre of the 18th fairway into the Pacific Ocean. He ended with a miserable 77, the low point a double after visiting the hazard down the right of the admittedly troublesome 8th. Ah well, as a student of links golf, there\u2019s always Portrush next month, it\u2019d be lovely to see him break his duck at the Open anyway. The popular Californian is off well today, with birdie at 3. He\u2019s level par for the tourney. Rhys Enoch reached the clubhouse late yesterday afternoon. The 30-year-old Welshman, who made it to Pebble Beach via the qualifiers at Walton Heath in Surrey, had been out in the penultimate three-ball, following up his miserable opening round of 78. Weekend participation looked extremely unlikely when he began yesterday with bogey at 1, but birdies at 4, 7 and 9, plus eagle at 6, saw him hit the turn in 31. He ended up with a 66, second best of day, bettered only in a US Open at Pebble Beach by Tiger Woods, Justin Rose and Gary Woodland (2000, Thursday and yesterday respectively). That meant he\u2019d swerved the cut, just, a sparkling performance from the Sunshine Tour regular. Enoch\u2019s been enjoying himself on the front nine again today, making consecutive birdies at 4, 5 and 6, though three bogeys have balanced out his card. He\u2019s level for his round through 13, and +2 overall. Here are a few of the names we\u2019ll be missing this weekend, on account of their failure to make the cut. The 2009 champion Lucas Glover; Branden \u2018Mr 62\u2019 Grace; Tony Finau; Jimmy Walker; Ian Poulter; Justin Thomas; Thorbjorn Olesen; the two-time winner Ernie Els; Kevin Na; Keegan Bradley; Kiradech Aphibarnrat; Kim Si-woo; Thomas Pieters; CT Pan. Or as major-championship Saturdays will soon be rebranded, Best Keep An Eye On What Brooks Is Doing Day. The two-time defending champion, looking to become only the second player to three-peat at a US Open, hasn\u2019t been playing that well this week, by his own lofty standards anyway. Yet he\u2019s still in a tie for sixth, just five shots off the lead, and Gary Woodland\u2019s had to post a bogey-free 65, equalling the Pebble Beach US Open record of Tiger Woods (2000) and Justin Rose (Thursday) to establish such an advantage. So it\u2019s on. The three-peat is still on. Woodland already looks tough to beat, mind. He was sensational yesterday. His birdie down 9, made despite his drive finding a deep divot, exemplified both his talent and steely determination. Long tipped for better things, without ever quite delivering, perhaps this is his time. But of course there are still 36 holes to play. With plenty of big names lurking, much could, and probably will, change over the next few hours, as the 119th United States Open Championship takes proper shape. Buckle up, it\u2019s going to be one heck of a ride around a track that\u2019s expected to get a little harder - and therefore harder - over the weekend.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump\u2019s feud with Sadiq Khan dates back to 2015 when they were both fighting election campaigns. It intensified after the terrorist attacks on London in 2017 and now threatens to overshadow the president\u2019s state visit to the UK. 10 December 2015 Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign pledge to ban Muslims from the US was criticised as \u201coutrageous\u201d by Sadiq Khan when he was standing to be mayor of London. He told the BBC that he hoped Trump \u201closes badly\u201d. 10 May 2016 After Khan was elected as mayor of London, Trump suggested Khan would be exempt from his proposed travel ban on Muslims. \u201cThere will always be exceptions,\u201d he said and added that the election of Khan was a \u201cgood thing\u201d. 16 May 2016 Khan said Trump\u2019s views on Muslims were \u201cignorant\u201d. Trump then challenged Khan to an IQ test. \u201cI will remember those statements. They are very nasty statements,\u201d he told ITV. 4 June 2017 After the terrorist attacks on Borough Market and London Bridge, Trump falsely suggested in a tweet that Khan had said there was \u201cno reason to be alarmed\u201d. Khan had actually said the public should not be alarmed by the increased police presence on London\u2019s streets. A spokesman for Khan responded by saying he had \u201cmore important things to do than respond to Donald Trump\u2019s ill-informed tweet that deliberately takes out of context his remarks\u201d. Trump followed up with another tweet, saying this was a \u201cpathetic excuse\u201d that the mainstream media was \u201cworking hard to sell\u201d. 6 June 2017 Khan called on the government to cancel Trump\u2019s state visit to the UK. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should roll out the red carpet to the president of the USA in the circumstances where his policies go against everything we stand for,\u201d he said. 29 July 2017 Khan told the Guardian he was a \u201creluctant participant\u201d in his ongoing row with Trump. He said: \u201cWe\u2019re not schoolchildren. He\u2019s the president of the United States, so I\u2019m unclear what his beef is with me.\u201d 5 July 2018 Khan\u2019s office gave permission for anti-Trump activists to fly a protest blimp of Trump as a crying baby in a nappy. Later, free speech campaigners made a blimp of Khan wearing a yellow bikini in protest at \u201cbody-shaming\u201d adverts the mayor vowed to ban on the London Underground. 13 July 2018 On his working visit to London, Trump claimed Khan had \u201cdone a very bad job on terrorism\u201d. He added: \u201cI think he has done a bad job on crime, if you look, all of the horrible things going on there, with all of the crime that is being brought in.\u201d 1 June 2019 Khan compared the language used by Trump to rally his supporters to that of \u201cthe fascists of the 20th century\u201d. Writing in the Observer he said: \u201cPresident Donald Trump is just one of the most egregious examples of a growing global threat. The far right is on the rise around the world, threatening our hard-won rights and freedoms and the values that have defined our liberal, democratic societies for more than 70 years.\u201d 2 June 2019 In an interview with the Sunday Times, Trump compared Khan to the New York mayor, Bill de Blasio, and said he had no plans to meet him during his state visit to London. Trump said: \u201cI don\u2019t think much of him. I think that he\u2019s the twin of De Blasio, except shorter.\u201d 3 June 2019 Just before landing in the UK, Trump described Khan as \u201ca stone cold loser\u201d and \u201cvery dumb\u201d. Khan\u2019s office accused Trump of \u201cchildish insults\u201d . 15 June 2019 After three people were killed in London in the space of 24 hours, Trump retweeted a tweet from right-wing commentator Katie Hopkins and said that the UK capital needed a new mayor and that Khan was \u201ca disaster\u201d. Several hours later he tweeted again, saying that Khan was \u2018destroying the City of London.\u201d A spokesman for the mayor said that Khan\u2019s thoughts were \u201cwith the victims\u2019 families. He is not going to waste his time responding to this sort of tweet.\u201d",
