More specifically it was Australia\u2019s opening batsman versus the fast bowler Kagiso Rabada, the match-up that had created so much friction in the ill-fated 2018 Test series that saw Warner banned for a year.</p> <p>In that series the pair were after each other throughout. When Warner had a scuffle with South African wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock in a stairwell at the Durban ground, the leaked security footage showed Rabada remaining on the landing after Warner had been hustled away, glaring in his departing direction with the kind of stare that could have burned through stone.</p> <p>When Warner had another departure in the Port Elizabeth Test, it came after Rabada had given him a working over, targeting his body before taking his stumps. Rabada received an ICC sanction for shouting at the batsman, while already facing an unresolved charge for shouldering Australia\u2019s then-captain Steve Smith in the first innings.</p> <p>And when Rabada appealed the Smith charge to be cleared to play in the third Test in Cape Town, Warner went after him all guns blazing. After five balls where Warner was hit hard on the arm and then edged past his stumps, he smashed five boundaries in a row from Rabada, including an audacious flip-pull for six. The sixth ball in the sequence cost him his stumps.</p> <p>It was the second day of a Test match and Warner had made 30 off 14 balls, which his batting partner Cameron Bancroft claimed did not represent any particular desire to take Rabada down. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say Dave did anything out of the ordinary to attack him or anything like that, I think he just played his natural way and at the end of the day he got a pretty good ball to get him out.\u201d As it turned out, Bancroft wasn\u2019t always the best at summing up a situation, as the following day he became collateral damage when Warner\u2019s animosity spilled over into ball-tampering.</p> <p>So in this year\u2019s World Cup match at Old Trafford, their meeting was one to anticipate. They didn\u2019t face off immediately; South Africa\u2019s leg-spinner Imran Tahir opened the bowling in an attempt to confuse Australia\u2019s aggressive openers. There was certainly confusion as Warner should have been run out in the first over, only for the ball to be returned to the wrong end. The fielder? Rabada.</p> <p>That at least gave him the pleasure of bowling at Warner in the second over, and immediately beating him with a beauty past the outside edge. A seriously fast short ball cut Warner in half, then another short one crashed into the splice.</p> <p>In the subsequent over it was counter-punch time, with Warner lofting over cover with the fielding restrictions in play. Four runs. Warner blocked the next, then was fried by a ball that screamed through and nearly nicked him off again, followed by a bouncer that had him leaping. Warner replied in the next over with a pull for six, then after several more survival shots, a top edge fine for four.</p> <p>It was compelling, end to end stuff. And by the end of it Warner was still there, with half of Rabada\u2019s allotted overs gone. He was still there on 66 when Rabada came back in the 23rd over. Glenn Maxwell did Australia the favour of soaking up one Rabada over, avoiding the risk of Warner trying something too expansive, but that cost Maxwell his wicket instead in Rabada\u2019s seventh.</p> <p>With Faf du Plessis hoarding his strike bowler\u2019s last three overs, Warner went on, and on. Chasing 326 he didn\u2019t have much choice. With four wickets down and one retired hurt he had even less choice. This seemed to galvanise Warner, who has pottered and scratched around at times through this World Cup even while piling up an unreasonable number of runs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/jul/06/australia-v-south-africa-cricket-world-cup-2019-live\">South Africa beat Australia by 10 runs: Cricket World Cup 2019 \u2013  as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This time there was none of that.

The album included the single Girl from Ipanema, sung by Astrud Gilberto, to whom Gilberto was then married. It sold more than a million copies, and brought him international acclaim.</p> <p>It was an extraordinary achievement for a musician who had initially struggled to succeed and find acceptance for his music. Born in Juazeiro in Bahia state, he began playing the guitar as a teenager, forming a band while still at school.

His experiment also suggests to him that Liberals alienated by brutal factionalism, or by comparatively progressive leaders like Malcolm Turnbull, will flirt with a breakaway movement but return to the mothership if they get a sufficiently red meat conservative.</p> <p>To put it bluntly, he\u2019s discovered consciously declining to be reactionary isn\u2019t a winning formula on the right in 2019. \u201cWe were too sensible for a lot of people who want the system detonated,\u201d he says.</p> <p>If this sounds like sour grapes, or revisionism, it isn\u2019t.

      "bodyText": "If you ask him to tell you who killed Australian Conservatives \u2013 Cory Bernardi\u2019s attempt to pitch a new tent on the right flank of Australian politics \u2013 the technical answer is Bernardi. He\u2019s folded his own political political party. But the substantive answer, he says candidly, is Scott Morrison. Morrison\u2019s ascension in August last year knocked his insurgency stone dead. \u201cHe reclaimed a lot of the ground we\u2019d tilled the soil for,\u201d Bernardi says. Once Malcolm Turnbull was deposed \u201cthere was a very clear move back to them\u201d. But the story of the demise of Australian Conservatives is more interesting and multidimensional than Morrison being a Liberal leader Bernardi\u2019s rightwing supporters could vote for without holding their noses. After a parliamentary term spent trying to carve out territory on the hard right fringe of Australian politics, trying to create a conservative party that declined to be overtly nationalist or racist, Bernardi has concluded the voters just aren\u2019t interested. The experiment might not have foundered, Bernardi tells Guardian Australia\u2019s politics podcast this week, if the Liberals had lost the May election, gone rancorously into opposition, and the conservative and liberal wings had split, although he insists he\u2019s \u201cgrateful\u201d that didn\u2019t happen. Given how things landed, he\u2019s taken stock of the journey, and reached some conclusions. The view progressive Australians have of Bernardi is he\u2019s an outlier \u2013 inflammatory on same sex marriage, which he once predicted could presage bestiality, provocative on Islam, which he once categorised as a \u201ctotalitarian, political and religious ideology\u201d. But in the febrile and highly competitive world of the micro-party right, the South Australian was a mainstream conservative; an economic rationalist and free marketeer who was avowedly socially conservative but not interested in being a shopfront for evangelical Christianity. Bernardi has concluded rusted-off rightwing voters aren\u2019t interested in a micro party alternative that espouses comparatively mainstream conservative values, and prioritises policy consistency over flip-flop populism. His experiment also suggests to him that Liberals alienated by brutal factionalism, or by comparatively progressive leaders like Malcolm Turnbull, will flirt with a breakaway movement but return to the mothership if they get a sufficiently red meat conservative. To put it bluntly, he\u2019s discovered consciously declining to be reactionary isn\u2019t a winning formula on the right in 2019. \u201cWe were too sensible for a lot of people who want the system detonated,\u201d he says. If this sounds like sour grapes, or revisionism, it isn\u2019t. Bernardi doesn\u2019t blame anybody else, or cast himself as a victim. He\u2019s clinical in his own debrief, acknowledging that he, and the party he put together, wasn\u2019t equipped to deal with the complexities that presented themselves over the past couple of years. His self-appraisal is, in fact, brutal. \u201cWe spent millions of dollars getting a message out that no one listened to,\u201d he says. When he embarked on the Australian Conservatives experiment, Bernardi made some assumptions. Principal among them was One Nation would implode, creating room for a new entrant to the rightwing petrie dish in Australian politics. He was correct about the implosion but Bernardi did not grasp how loyal Pauline Hanson\u2019s base was. One Nation supporters are \u201csticky\u201d, he says. He discovered just how sticky when he attempted to critique Hanson\u2019s obvious contradictions and inconsistencies. The blowback, he says, was intense. People would be abusive, telling him Hanson \u201cwent to jail for us\u201d. Bernardi says he discovered there was no prospect of a logical conversation with the Hanson cohort \u2013 a cohort he calls \u201cthe angry voter\u201d. He says extreme nationalists, politicians with a \u201crace-based orientation\u201d, have a perennial appeal for a proportion of Australian voters. \u201cThese people are not healthy for us on the right side of politics,\u201d he says. Bernardi says the racism, the antisemitism, the aggressively exclusionary rhetoric about Islam, is dangerous, but he\u2019s always held the view that these attitudes exist in Australia, and political movements have to address fears in the community by speaking to these issues, otherwise nativism will escalate. \u201cI think you\u2019ve got to stop that rising,\u201d he says.

The club plays a vital role for a diverse, low-income community living in one of Melbourne\u2019s most gentrified suburbs. Local business sponsorships and some council funding mean there are no fees, and the club can hire buses to ferry the players to away games. Abdurahman acknowledges that many of the young players have had difficult lives. Many are refugees and a sizeable proportion are African Australian, including Abdurahman, who came to Australia from Ethiopia in the mid-2000s. Others come from Asian, Arab and Indigenous backgrounds, he says. Fitzroy Lions player Roma Bahmoud competes against Watsonia Heights football club. To help the older players into employment, Abdurahman has created a work experience program with a local Coles supermarket. And the club\u2019s first competitive season has been a success so far. \u201cJust last week, we won 18-0 with one of the teams,\u201d Abdurahman says. That\u2019s the thing, these kids are talented. The talent is just too much to handle, but they don\u2019t have the opportunity. It just makes me happy to see them on the field. Making a run for the ball.",

      "bodyText": "The Morrison government says it remains committed to a plan criticised as \u201cbrutal\u201d to dock the welfare of those who repeatedly fail to pay state fines, and may still proceed with cuts to student payments claimed by the unemployed, the disabled and sole parents. The Coalition introduced a number of welfare measures in 2017 which drew the ire of social service groups but ultimately never came into effect because the government failed to win the support of the Senate or the states and territories. Guardian Australia reported this month that internal documents suggested the contentious plan to drug test welfare recipients was not a priority, but the government has insisted it remains on its agenda. Other welfare proposals from the last parliament included about $90m in cuts to student payments, legislation to automatically deduct rent from welfare recipients living in social housing, which critics said could put family violence survivors at risk, and a plan to impose the \u201cdemerit point\u201d compliance scheme on those doing the remote work-for-the-dole program, which has seen payment suspensions surge. Asked whether the government would pursue these policies, a spokesman for the new social services minister, Anne Ruston, said only: \u201cThe government is working through the legislative priorities of the year ahead.\u201d But the spokesman did confirm the government still intended to create the scheme to automatically dock 15% of payments for those who have unpaid fines. The policy was scheduled to begin in March, but appeared to be in disarray with the government failing to win the support of the Senate or states and territories, who would ultimately benefit from the recouped revenue. However, the make-up of the new Senate is more favourable to the government. \u201cThe Encouraging Lawful Behaviour of Income Support Recipients proposal remains government policy and requires legislative approval,\u201d Ruston\u2019s spokesman said. \u201cThe announced commencement date of 1 March 2019 was subject to the passage of legislation and agreement with jurisdictions on the operation of the measure.\u201d Labor had opposed the cuts to the $208-a-year pensioner education supplement and the $32.20-a week education entry payment, which are intended to help low-income people with the cost of study. The changes would save the budget $95m over five years, but the opposition said the policy would hurt people with disability, carers, sole parents and the unemployed. The Australian Council of Social Service has previously lashed the plan to dock welfare payments from people with court-ordered state fines as \u201cparticularly brutal\u201d. The proposal would automatically dock 15% of an income support payment, but critics say it will push vulnerable people into homelessness. Welfare groups including the Australian Unemployed Workers Union have also expressed grave concerns about a plan announced last year to link Newstart recipients to farm work using the national database. The unemployed would face losing their welfare payments for four weeks if they turned down what the government described as a \u201csuitable job without reasonable excuse\u201d. The department of employment confirmed the policy would begin in July next year. But it would not respond to questions about how the policy would work, including whether people would be supported to relocate, or what would be considered a \u201creasonable excuse\u201d.",

For the giant <a href=\"https://www.inpex.com.au/our-projects/ichthys-lng-project/\">Ichthys</a> project in the NT, gas is extracted from an offshore well in the Browse Basin, between Australia and Indonesia, and sent 890km via subsea pipe to Darwin.

Australia is a significant player in this drive, with $38bn in investments on the books \u2013 fourth behind only the US, Canada or Russia. As the prime minister, Scott Morrison, concedes, Australia\u2019s emissions are rising \u2013 they have been since 2015. The government\u2019s analysis blames much of that on LNG. Yet the idea the export gas industry is good for the planet \u2013 and Australia deserves credit for it \u2013 appears set for a serious workout in this parliament. Some uncontested facts: the Australian industry has surged across the Top End in the past five years to a point where the country rivals Qatar as the world\u2019s biggest LNG exporter. Seven multi-decade developments have started production at Gladstone, Queensland, near Darwin and especially in northern Western Australia. Export earnings from LNG increased 61% in two years to almost $50bn, putting it behind only iron ore in value. The industry employs thousands of people. LNG developments often involve remarkable feats of engineering. For the giant Ichthys project in the NT, gas is extracted from an offshore well in the Browse Basin, between Australia and Indonesia, and sent 890km via subsea pipe to Darwin. There, the gas is cooled into liquid form. It is then shipped to Asia, converted back to gas and burned to generate electricity and heat and used in industrial processes, including making plastic. It is an incredibly energy intensive process and produces a large amount of heat-trapping emissions. Berlin-based researchers at Climate Analytics found the growth in LNG pollution in Australia between 2015 and 2020 would effectively wipe out that avoided through the 23% national renewable energy target. LNG emissions in Australia reach the atmosphere as methane, which leaks from wells and pipes as it is extracted and transported, and as carbon dioxide when gas is processed and burned. LNG emissions in Australia are significant but dwarfed by what is released when the gas is decompressed and burned in Japan, China and Korea. Taylor says these emissions are good because LNG is taking the place of coal and there are fewer emissions than there would otherwise be. He is yet to address the inconsistency in the government promoting gas exports as good for the climate while also enthusiastically backing coal exports including Adani\u2019s controversial Carmichael mine. The 150m tonnes a year Taylor cites comes from a back-of-the-envelope calculation by the environment department \u2013 the difference between burning all the LNG Australia exported last year and burning an equivalent amount of black coal. No evidence has been given that LNG is displacing coal to that extent but the figure was included as evidence in the department\u2019s latest report on national emissions. Taylor then claimed Australia\u2019s emissions \u201chad the potential\u201d to lower global emissions by that amount; by the time parliament resumed it had become a fact. The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (Appea) has made similar claims. Neither Taylor\u2019s office nor Appea answered a question from Guardian Australia on what basis they assumed LNG was displacing coal. Based on the most recent advice from the government\u2019s office of the chief economist, there doesn\u2019t appear to be one. In a quarterly commodities report released on 1 July, the office says Japan \u2013 Australia\u2019s biggest LNG market \u2013 has started reopening the large nuclear power fleet closed after the Fukushima disaster. The office says gas in Japan is expected to face increasing competition from nuclear and renewable power. Where it is preferred to these sources LNG is increasing global emissions. This marries up with a trend illustrated by the International Energy Agency: gas and coal use jumped after Fukushima, increasing global emissions. Now nuclear is starting to return. The picture is a little less clear in China, the second biggest market for Australian LNG. It wants the share of gas in the energy mix to rise from 7% to 15% by 2030, in part to help reduce air pollution caused by coal. It is also increasing its use of nuclear, solar and wind. Tony Wood, energy program director at thinktank the Grattan Institute, is annoyed by claims that gas is displacing coal. \u201cIt is a counterfactual \u2013 unprovable \u2013 but is speculative at best, highly questionable at worst.\u201d Wood says there may be some instances where gas is preferred to coal but it is likely to also be competing with nuclear and gas from Qatar, which \u2013 due to fugitive methane emissions from wells on the West Australian North West Shelf and some Queensland coal-seam gas fields \u2013 could be cleaner than that from Australia. He objects to suggestions Australia deserves credit for its LNG exports while emissions are increasing at home. Frank Jotzo, an economist and professor at the ANU Crawford School of Public Policy, says: \u201cWhat is certain is the expansion of the LNG industry is holding up the transition to zero carbon fuels.\u201d He says any conversation about LNG emissions come with a significant caveat: we still do not have a good estimate of global fugitive emissions. Gas has about half the CO2 emissions of coal when burned but methane leaked during processing \u2013 while lasting in the atmosphere only about 12 years \u2013 is so potent it has a warming power about 28 times greater than CO2 when calculated over a century. A recent study found the level of atmospheric methane has increased significantly since 2007 after a relative flat period. Scientists say they are unsure why. But they are clear that methane emissions need to be reduced. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says they need to be cut by 35% between 2010 and 2050 under a path that gives the world a chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C. Despite this, a dramatic expansion of the LNG is proposed across the globe, mostly in North America but also Australia. According to the Global Energy Monitor, these plans put the LNG industry on a collision course with the goals of the Paris agreement. Ted Nace, the group\u2019s executive director, says there is still time for a moratorium on new LNG developments. And he says the industry may yet face a wake-up call as the falling cost of renewable energy puts expensive fossil fuel investments at risk of becoming uncompetitive stranded assets. A paper in the journal Nature last week suggests something will have to give on LNG plans if the world is to stop the climate crisis pushing into more dangerous territory. Researchers from California and Beijing calculated if all existing fossil fuel infrastructure across the planet was allowed to run for its expected lifespan that alone would be enough to push global heating beyond 1.5C.",

      "bodyText": "Phil Neville is back where it all began. A month ago he sat at the same beachside restaurant on the pebbly Mediterranean shoreline, just beneath the Promenade des Anglais, and talked about trying to win the World Cup. Four weeks on England manager\u2019s suntan is several shades deeper but Neville has failed, albeit narrowly, to lead the Lionesses into Sunday\u2019s final in Lyon. Speaking before the defeat in the third-place play\u2011off against Sweden on Saturday, he seems to be still in Nice in body only but, contrary to rumours swirling around the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, the former Manchester United defender is not eyeing a lucrative ticket back into the men\u2019s game. \u201cThe last 18 months have given me things no other job could have done,\u201d he says. \u201cYou read stories, people saying: \u2018What\u2019s the next move?\u2019 but I can\u2019t think of a better job. I\u2019m with an organisation [the FA] that backs anything I want. I get a set of players that sing and play to my tune; I\u2019ve got scope to make an impact on people\u2019s lives.\u201d Accordingly one of football\u2019s most hyperactive minds has already moved on to Tokyo, where he will lead an 18-strong GB squad at next year\u2019s Olympics and, after that, back to England, for Euro 2021. It is indicative that, in his hotel room in the hours before Tuesday night\u2019s 2-1 defeat by the United States, Neville was busy identifying which players he would soon be saying farewell to and their likely replacements. Which is not to say the agonising reverse to Jill Ellis\u2019s side on the sultriest of Lyon nights has left him immune from painful introspection. \u201cStraight afterwards I was fine,\u201d says England\u2019s manager. \u201cBut the next morning I was angry, disappointed, frustrated. I thought we\u2019d win but we were a little bit short. The mindset\u2019s got to change. We do 12 reps now; we\u2019ve got to start doing 16. The players realise they\u2019ve got to give an extra five or 10%.\u201d A \u201ctruth and honesty\u201d session in Nice on Thursday morning beckoned. \u201cWe spoke the honest truth to each other, cleared the air, put everything on the table,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes in life you have people around you who don\u2019t always tell you the truth but I did \u2013 I told them we need to start working harder or we\u2019ll never get past the semi\u2011final stage. \u201cSo our work\u2019s got to get even more brutal. I\u2019ve got to be more ruthless; I take responsibility; I should probably have got another five or 10% out of them. They need to know winning involves pain and sacrifice, mentally, technically and physically.\u201d Victory will also necessitate squad refreshment. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see a mass change of personnel,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re a young squad. Some players will be moved on and some won\u2019t make the standard but we\u2019ve widened the pool so that we\u2019ve got another 13 to 14 ready to come in. \u201cI came into this job with no previous knowledge of the women\u2019s game. That\u2019s actually been a benefit; it\u2019s opened up opportunities for players people told me should never play for England. I\u2019ve introduced ideas probably no one else was thinking of.\u201d Eighteen months into the role he is not ready to walk away, even if an improved deal would not go amiss. \u201cI\u2019m committed,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t see another job which would give me what I have now. I can\u2019t think of a better one. I love my job, I\u2019m happy.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m contracted until the end of Euro 2021 and, as long as the FA keep backing me and the players show the same kind of thirst for learning, I\u2019ll be here until then. But I\u2019m the kind of person that, if the players get bored of my ideas and stop listening, then I\u2019ll say: \u2018Thanks very much, you\u2019ve given me the best time of my life,\u2019 and empty my office.\u201d In the meantime Neville has unfinished business. \u201cLosing the semi-final does feel like failure. We wanted gold. The texts coming through saying, \u2018You\u2019ve inspired the nation\u2019 are lovely but annoying. I\u2019ve been brought up where winning\u2019s the only thing that matters.\u201d Small wonder he will refuse any invitations for a red carpet return. \u201cI don\u2019t want it. The players don\u2019t want it either. They\u2019ve not earned it. They\u2019d feel embarrassed. If we had an open-top bus tour around Trafalgar Square, it would be sending completely the wrong message. A trip to Downing Street would be celebrating failure.\u201d Yet despite England\u2019s third consecutive semi-final exit from a major tournament, Neville acknowledges his squad contains some excellent veterans capable of finally changing that narrative. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m letting Jill Scott retire in the next two years. The same goes for Steph Houghton and Karen Bardsley, They\u2019re too good, they\u2019ve been our best players, the spine of our team. \u201cBut 12 months ago we finished third in the under-20s World Cup. We\u2019ve had 11 of those players train with us, under the radar. We divide them into gold, silver and bronze types and we\u2019ve probably got eight gold star players in that group. They\u2019ll be in the Euro 2021 squad. \u201cManchester City\u2019s Lauren Hemp is one and we have to get them involved quickly but I\u2019m not going to give them caps just because they\u2019ve got potential. They\u2019ve got to be better than players performing at world-class level. That\u2019s an unbelievable challenge but, all of a sudden, we\u2019re going to have real competition for places.\u201d More immediately a holiday beckons. \u201cI just want to lie on a sun lounger,\u201d he concedes. \u201cAnd go to Wimbledon.\u201d",

What looks certain is that the South African number has a fine career ahead of him. </p> <p>One small query, though. Not about his batting but his treatment. Twice he was hit on the head by bouncers. The first of those, via Pat Cummins, was flush on the front of the lid. When the medical staff walked out to the middle, they were sent straight off by Umpire Dharmasena. Now, I know that RVDD didn\u2019t appear worried but surely he has to be given the once over before continuing?

They\u2019ve had a difficult time recently, with Shaun Marsh badly injured in the nets and Glenn Maxwell recovering. They made a real hash of their big chase against India at The Oval, and they were pretty ordinary in chasing a small total against Afghanistan. They\u2019ll have to do well today if they want to keep top spot, because India are romping past Sri Lanka in Leeds.</p> <p>South African fans meanwhile will be a combination of delighted and frustrated, wondering where this kind of batting was earlier in the tournament. But the question is also where were these surfaces. This one looks lovely for batting, lots of even bounce and the ability to play through the line.</p> <p>But at least this has been a good top-order performance, starting with the openers who got off to a flyer, then du Plessis and van der Dussen bringing it home. Australia have firepower, they might do this in a canter with Aaron Finch in the form of his life and David Warner a reliable foil. But it will be interesting to see how they approach it.</p> <p>An email question from Ruth Purdue: \u201cNow you\u2019re in my home city, what\u2019s your favourite ground in the World Cup, apart from Lord\u2019s?\u201d It may be heresy but I\u2019m not all that big on Lord\u2019s.

If Australia win, they get to chill out here in Manchester before their semi-final, then have a couple more days to relax before the final should they qualify. If Australia lose and India win, India will go top of the table and get the Manchester semi, which will be against the theoretically easier opponent New Zealand rather than England in Birmingham. Plenty to play for then.</p> <p>As for South Africa, they\u2019ve had a miserable tournament, and there\u2019s been a fair amount of pillorying and apologising and all that sort of thing, which seems entirely over the top for a sporting event.

The big news from Old Trafford is that Australia will travel to Birmingham to play England on Thursday, India now en route to Manchester for the first semi-final against New Zealand on Tuesday. We\u2019ll be back with the OBO tomorrow for the Women\u2019s Ashes clash from Canterbury. Until then... goodnight! Faf du Plessis talks. He wanted his team to go home with a small smile and they have. Cites van der Dussen is a great example for young players out there if you are struggling to get it away early you need to hang in there. Says it shows maturity from him. Mark Nicholas is thrilled about a slap he played down the ground off Pat Cummins and Faf is too. A word for JP Duminy and Imran Tahir as champion human beings. Well done, Faf. Class as always from the Proteas\u2019 captain. Blimey, what an evening. Warner, brilliant. Carey, even better. Khawaja, in major strife with his hamstring. Stoinis, quite possibly in just as much trouble with a side strain. For South Africa, Imran Tahir and JP Duminy leave the field in this format for their country for the final time and leave as winners. Rabada did it early and late, Phehlukwayo held his nerve. Faf du Plessis in the player of the match. The No 11 holes out to deep midwicket from the penultimate ball. A fine victory by the Protreas after an eventful run chase. Australia will play England in the second semi-final at Edgbaston on Thursday! WHOA! IS BEHRENDORFF RUN OUT? Stand by! He isn\u2019t. NOT OUT! Play on! Australia need 12 from the final three balls, having added a most unlikely three to begin the 50th. 49th over: Australia 308-9 (Behrendorff 5, Lyon 2) Target 326. Outstanding death bowling by Rabada. He\u2019s left Australia 18 to get from the last over. Phehlukwayo, who picked up the important wicket of Cummins just as Australia got on a roll, to bowl it. BOWLED! He\u2019s bent back middle stump! Starc did what he had to, trying to pop the length ball over long-on, but he missed and his opposing number hit. Khawaja ramps perfectly from well outside off stump... but it is on to his leg stump! He could not have timed that any better from outside the tram tracks; it was a certain boundary had it not collected the stumps en route. 25 off 11 needed. 48th over: Australia 301-7 (Starc 16, Khawaja 18) Target 326. Khawaja tries to ramp Morris and it comes off the outside edge, somehow, to third man. They all have a good laugh. Less so the bowler when Starc smacks him 81 metres over long-on for SIX! Back in the slot, Starc goes over his head for four more! Your move, Faf. He gets Starc off strike with one to deep point, Khawaja on strike for the final two balls as the sun finally goes back behind the stand. And he plays a brilliant clip off his pads into the gap for another boundary! One more to come in the expensive over, Khawaja digs it out for one to keep the strike. 17 from the over! They need 25 from 12 balls! Surely Australia can\u2019t do this with a bloke on one leg?! 47th over: Australia 284-7 (Starc 5, Khawaja 12) Target 326. Khawaja can\u2019t get Rabada away when it is in his half - or a couple of low full tosses - but he can help a bouncer on the way, hooking over short fine for four. With 42 from 18 balls needed, I can\u2019t imagine a scenario where he will risk doing any more damage to that hammy. Watching the close up camera, he is grimmacing between overs. 46th over: Australia 277-7 (Starc 4, Khawaja 6) Target 326. Well played, Chris Morris. He\u2019s done plenty right in this tournament without much reward but this over has probably won it for the Proteas - just three singles coming after claiming the key wicket of Carey. Instructively, Khawaja declines a sharp single, suggesting that if they are any chance it has to be in boundaries. They need 49 in 24 balls. Morris has got him! Carey slices, it\u2019s high in the air and Markram takes a fine catch running in off the deep point rope! The end of a brilliant 69-ball innings from the South Aussie. That should be that for South Africa. Khawaja walking out to resume his innings. 45th over: Australia 274-6 (Carey 85, Starc 1) Target 326. Excellent over of slower balls from Phehlukwayo, repaying the faith showed in him by du Plessis. Interestingly, it is Starc joining Carey rather than the injured Khawaja. We are told that he sustained the hamstring strain when batting, not fielding. \u201cA quick question, and I just joined the OBO and so do not know if this has been asked and answered already,\u201d starts Archishman \u201cWho would the typical England supporter prefer to face in the semis? Australia or India? Does anyone know?\u201d Surely that\u2019s Australia? Especially given the injuries sustained today. Cummins hits the all-rounder hiiiiigh in the air off the top edge and Duminy takes the safe chance at long-off. The main man, Carey, is still there but he\u2019s running out of reliable partners. 44th over: Australia 269-5 (Carey 83, Cummins 8) Target 326. Tandem legspinners in the final ten overs of an ODI! Brilliant scenes for lovers of the craft. Shamsi is less effective this time around though, unlucky not to win Carey\u2019s wicket off an edge that runs away for four but culpable for letting the left-hander free his arms in the slot, slow-swept like Steve Waugh in this corresponding fixture (sort of!) in 1999. All told, 12 from it. They need 57 from 36 balls. 43rd over: Australia 257-5 (Carey 72, Cummins 7) Target 326. Told you! Cummins backs himself against Tahir, nailing him over cover. Carey\u2019s turn and he goes better again HUGE over long on for SIX! And again, he directs to the other side of the ground, flat-batting four more to long off. Supreme timing! 17 off it. The battle for (staying in) Manchester has some sting left in it yet! 42nd over: Australia 240-5 (Carey 60, Cummins 2) Target 326. Outstanding over from Shamsi, back into the attack and going for just two singles, Carey to third man and Cummins down the ground. He has 0/48 from his eight so far but with the exception of one, he\u2019s been frugal and dangerous. Keep him on, Faf! Jarrod Kimber notes on radio that Cummins was up at No7 in the Big Bash a couple of years ago and did well enough to win a Man of the Match gong on the basis of his biffing. Somewhere, he has the skills to do this alongside Carey. 41st over: Australia 236-5 (Carey 58, Cummins 1) Target 326. With Carey there is hope for the Australians. He is taking on Tahir, down the track for two to begin down the ground with mid-off up then launching over his head to finish! Nine from the over, which is just short of what they need in every over in this final stretch. And despite Cummins\u2019 troubles of late with the blade, he can hit a ball. 40th over: Australia 227-5 (Carey 50, Cummins 0) Target 326. A wicket maiden in the 40th over! How about that! Cummins cannot get Pretorious away. A magnificent over at a crucial time. Australia need 99 from the final ten. From nowhere! THE BIG WICKET! Warner tries to clear mid-on after running the pitch but he\u2019s caught by a diving Chris Morris. 39th over: Australia 227-4 (Warner 122, Carey 50) Target 326. Carey to 50 with a clever shot, steering over third man for another four. Rabada has been brought back but it hasn\u2019t worked. He has only two overs left. They need a wicket urgently. I\u2019m very much up for writing up the history of that incident before Thursday. 38th over: Australia 220-4 (Warner 121, Carey 45) Target 326. Morris still has four overs left to get through, which Warner will like the sound of. But they do show him a fraction more respect after the big over against Shamsi, satisfied with the singles on offer out to the sweepers. The fourth of those rasied the 100 partnership between these two, in just 83 balls. But they need 106 more in 72. 37th over: Australia 215-4 (Warner 118, Carey 43) Target 326. They are having a real pop now, Shamsi under pressure for the first time so far today. They go bang, bang, bang here - Carey smashing a long-hop, Warner pulling behind square then lofting over cover for back to back boundaries. 16 from the over. \u201cNever have we seen a team fight so hard to stay in Manchester,\u201d quips Bharat Sundaresan on radio. 111 from 78 balls is an equation Warner and Carey won\u2019t be daunted by. 36th over: Australia 199-4 (Warner 109, Carey 36) Target 326. Watching Warner\u2019s ton celebration back, he really gave it big. More than usual. Perhaps it means a touch more against South Africa? I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll ask him later. He goes again from the first ball of Morris\u2019 fresh over, hammering him back over his head! He\u2019s getting better and better the longer he is there. What could halt him? Injury. Or cramp. There\u2019s something giving him trouble, causing him to signal to the dressing room. Probably cramp. Time for some of that pickle juice they so enjoy. \u201cIs this the World Cup with the highest number of injuries to players during the tournament and at nets?\u201d asks Anand Kumar. \u201cDont remember reading about do many net session injuries.\u201d Better than pre-play football injuries. Actually, I shouldn\u2019t say that as I really enjoy watching England play their games before play. 35th over: Australia 191-4 (Warner 102, Carey 35) Target 326. Carey is going stroke for stroke with Warner, jumping down at Tahir\u2019s first ball and driving over mid-off for his fifth four. Warner\u2019s turn, who is denied another four himself only by the stumps at the non-strikers\u2019 end. They now need 135 from 90 balls. 34th over: Australia 183-4 (Warner 101, Carey 29) Target 326. What a wonderful way to bring it up, a perfect late cut through the cordon for four. His ton is up from an even 100 balls. Even if Australia don\u2019t get up here, what form this opener is in. From the ball before he struck another four off Morris to move to 97 off his hip with ease. Put it this way: if Warner is still batting in an hour, they probably win. 33rd over: Australia 174-4 (Warner 93, Carey 28) Target 326. CRUNCH! Warner gets a full toss from Tahir, back into the attack, and gives it the treatment through cover to move into the 90s. Carey\u2019s turn and he looks like he might have given a return catch but the replay confirms it is a bump ball. Drinks are on the field \u201cIs Khawaja going to be able to bat?\u201d asks Aleksei Vasilev. \u201cAnd with Stoinis too injured, does this mean Handscomb and Mitch Marsh will now play the semifinal? If Khawaja is gone, I say parachute Matty Wade in.\u201d All of that could happen. There\u2019s a lot going on in camp Australian, all of a sudden. 32nd over: Australia 167-4 (Warner 88, Carey 26) Target 326. Carey is flying now. He\u2019s such a clever cricketer, laying his base before going at the bowling. Against Duminy, the sixth bowler for South Africa, he cuts late and perfectly behind point for four. Later in the set, he punishes an overpitched delivery through cover for another. They are keeping the required rate below nine. Now to keep it there. 31st over: Australia 157-4 (Warner 88, Carey 17) Target 326. Shot, Alex. That\u2019s a gem of a stroke, timed off the pads what gap there is on the legside, racing away. Make no mistake, he\u2019s been Australia\u2019s find of the comp. Warner is less convincing with another top edge, this time landing just beyond the man on the 45. \u201cEvening Adam.\u201d Hello, Damian Clarke. \u201cThere I was, in the garden, evening sunshine dappling onto my deckchair through the leaves of the oak, gently dozing to the commentary on the DAB. Lovely. Then, two doors down, the party starts, with a Liam Gallagher impressionist screeching out at nearly 150dB on the PA. So I\u2019ve retreated to my safe room in the basement to join you on OBO. Sanity slowly returning.\u201d You\u2019ve made a good decision. I wonder when the Cricketarist will bust out Everlong tonight? I cracked the code about two weeks ago: they play this the moment the decision is made that the game, as a contest, is over. 30th over: Australia 148-4 (Warner 84, Carey 12) Target 326. Clever from Warner, reversing his hands to access the territory behind point for a boundary. We should never forget that he still has all of those tricks. Carey is happy enough playing himself in with singles for now but they\u2019ll have to put the foot down soon. 29th over: Australia 141-4 (Warner 78, Carey 11) Target 326. Warner nearly caught by van der Dussen running back with the flight at mid-off! Shamsi creates the error, the opener miscuing high in the air. He stuck out a hand but didn\u2019t quite have the reach. Earlier in the over, Carey nearly gave a catch back to the spinner as well. Shamsi remains dangerous in over over where he is used. \u201cThe absolute \u2018bantz\u2019 if England get knocked out of their own World Cup due to inclement weather,\u201d replies Digvijay Yadav about the prospect of Edgbaston\u2019s semi getting rained out. They do have spare days for the semi, it\u2019s worth noting 28th over: Australia 136-4 (Warner 74, Carey 10) Target 326. Five more risk-free singles down the ground off Duminy. We\u2019re yet to get an update on Stoinis from CA\u2019s media officer. As soon as that comes through, I\u2019ll let you know. 27th over: Australia 131-4 (Warner 71, Carey 8) Target 326. Spin twins! Shamsi does take over at the Jimmy End. They are more comfortable against him this time around, hitting the sweepers and rotating the strike for five. Australia now require 8.5 runs an over. Alternatively: they require 200-odd from Warner. \u201cPeople question whether Marcus Stoinis justifies his spot in a top-line outfit,\u201d says Nick Toovey, \u201cbut one aspect where he leads the world is the disappointed/angry look at himself. He truly is world class at letting everybody know that he really is better than what he has just produced.\u201d He also has down the skill of balancing his helmet on the back of his head as he walks from the field. That can\u2019t be easy. It has been written (by Vish, once of this parish, from memory) that England\u2019s players always wear their helmets all the way to the dressing room to prevent an unflattering shot being taken of them. 26th over: Australia 126-4 (Warner 69, Carey 5) Target 326. A bit strange that Shamsi was taken off with Warner so obviously struggling against him. We\u2019ll see if he is swung around next up. Instead, it JP Duminy now with his off-breaks for now, operating from the broadcast end in this his final ODI. It works a treat to begin, going for just one down the ground, Carey defending the rest. 25th over: Australia 125-4 (Warner 68, Carey 5) Target 326. I\u2019m surprised that Carey wasn\u2019t elevated ahead of Stoinis and Maxwell given how he is going but he\u2019s out there now at No7 with plenty of overs still in this game for him. First up, the \u2018keeper is beaten by Rabada, squaring him up a treat. But he gets a chance to play a cover drive - his best shot - later in the set, making no mistake. Urrrgh, Maxwell out just as he was against England off an edge behind from a pull/hook gone wrong, de Kock pouching an easy chance. Bringing Rabada on to him has worked a treat. He never looked at ease out there today. 24th over: Australia 119-3 (Warner 67, Maxwell 12) Target 326. Maxwell isn\u2019t in control here, his inside edge used to begin from Shamsi. Later in the over, they\u2019re up for leg before against Warner but it is heading down leg and they don\u2019t review. 23rd over: Australia 116-3 (Warner 66, Maxwell 10) Target 326. Rabada is back, which is a logical move from Faf given the way Maxwell has been out in the competition so far. Even Justin Langer issued some concern about the Victorian against genuine pace. Sure enough, he beats him twice to begin. The first comes off the inside edge, not far at all from the woodwork, the next sailing past the outside edge with the bat a fair way from his body. Maxwell does get a couple with a neat steer down to third man, which will be good for the confidence. He keeps the strike with one to cover. His strike rate in the tournament is 195. 22nd over: Australia 113-3 (Warner 66, Maxwell 7) Target 326. Shamsi is well in the game early in this spell, both batsmen only taking the single to long off on offer. Warner is well beaten by the last delivery, a genuine edge spitting through first slip for four. Not a bad matchup with the left-arm wrist spinner against the opener. 21st over: Australia 107-3 (Warner 61, Maxwell 6) Target 326. A poor over from Phehlukwayo to begin, Maxwell getting the chance to free his arms to smash through midwicket to the rope. Don\u2019t bowl there to him. Oh, he does again to Warner, who puts away a second half-tracker. South Africa are in control but they need a decent shift from their all-rounder with these two batting together. 20th over: Australia 97-3 (Warner 56, Maxwell 1) Target 326. Thanks, Geoff, for stepping in as the super sub. What an unfortunate bit of running, Stoinis unable to dive due to the side strain injury he is so clearly carrying. He was very glum walking off in front of my position - he looks to be in big trouble for the semi. Shamsi now for his first over of left-arm wrist spin, Warner trying to force him away through the off-side but unable to beat the field through the first four balls, two singles to finish through cover. An excellent start from the second spinner. \u201cIf I\u2019ve understood the rules correctly,\u201d says Phillip Mallett, \u201cAustralia may have good reason to want to play at Edgbaston, given the forecast for rain on Thursday and Friday, since if the game is cancelled they surely go through to the final as the higher placed team?\u201d Gosh, there is a bit going on all of a sudden, isn\u2019t there? How about this: if the game today is a tie, Australia will leapfrog India on Net Run Rate. That would be... well, controversial. Such a turn of events would definitely get NRR scrapped forever. 19th over: Australia 95-3 (Warner 55, Maxwell 0) Target 326. Tahir slips after a good over in the 16th. He bowls a full toss and Warner punishes it through midwicket. Easy. But then the run-out comes, and Maxwell comes in. Carefully. Blots out the over. Adam Collins is back. Alley-oop. That is an incredible piece of wicketkeeping from Quentin de Kock! Rabada has botched two previous run-outs but this time he\u2019s involved with a successful one. Warner knocks Tahir away for a single and takes off. Stoinis isn\u2019t fully fit and struggles. Rabada tries to throw down the stumps from midwicket and is just offline, but instead of taking the ball as it bounces near his left leg, de Kock stretches down his left hand and redirects it behind himself onto the stumps. No-look deflection. And Stoinis is short by a few inches. 17th over: Australia 91-2 (Warner 51, Stoinis 22) Target 326. Warner drives straight for one, and there\u2019s his milestone. There are some jeers but more cheers from the stands. \u201cI even saw a South African applauding!\u201d says Jim Maxwell on the wireless. A couple more singles, then Stoinis gets a leg-side gift and swivels on his back leg to pull it fine for four. The partnership is worth 58 now. 17th over: Australia 84-2 (Warner 49, Stoinis 17) Target 326. Tahir is back. A couple of leg breaks, a couple of googlies, off his long curved run. From the far end it almost looks like he\u2019s running at right angles to the wicket. Warner just knocks a couple of singles, gauging the risk. 16th over: Australia 81-2 (Warner 47, Stoinis 16) Target 326. Chris Morris in from the broadcast end and Warner pulls him for six! Lined it up, Warner, and got it a bit up and down but lobbed it comfortably into the crowd on the short side of the ground. Warner is having to fire up in the absence of his senior teammates. Drinks. \u201cGiven the history between these sides in world cups happening in England, a tie is always on the cards. So, does NRR decide the final standings as India and Aus will end up with same number of wins?\u201d Hello Anand. It\u2019ll be NRR indeed if that\u2019s the case. 15th over: Australia 72-2 (Warner 39, Stoinis 15) Target 326. Pretorious pitches up, Warner just lofts the straight drive casually over the bowler, and it bounces away for four down the ground. Chip shot with a bit of sauce. Stoinis gets the strike after a single, and he\u2019s determined to play everything off the back foot. He does so again, for an on-side drive! Outstanding technique. Back-foot punch through wide long-on for four. You don\u2019t see many of those. 14th over: Australia 63-2 (Warner 34, Stoinis 11) Target 326. Morris is bowling full, but the batsmen keep finding the field. Just a single to Warner from the over. \u201cAustralia not looking like a team that\u2019s too concerned at the prospect of a trip to Edgbaston on Thursday?\u201d asks Brian Withington. I\u2019m sure England would rather play Australia at Edgbaston than Lord\u2019s. And Australia would have two more days to get their injury niggles right. 13th over: Australia 62-2 (Warner 33, Stoinis 11) Target 326. I said cheerio very blithely before, didn\u2019t I? Now I\u2019m back. When they sentence you to seven years hard labour on the OBO, they mean it. So a half-hobbled Stoinis and a counter-punching Warner are doing their best. Pretorius gives Stoinis exactly the length that he wants so he can punch off the back foot instead of striding forward. Four through point. Warner slashes four of his own off the top edge, fine third man. 12th over: Australia 51-2 (Warner 28, Stoinis 6) Target 326. Morris, who has had some very good days with the ball in this tournament, replaces the excellent Rabada. Warner enjoys the shift, smashing a loose first delivery off the back foot through point for four. The new man responds well, beating Warner with one that cuts away. Into his channel, Warner plays out the rest respectfully. I\u2019m returning to radio for half an hour, Geoff Lemon jumping back into the chair in my place. Keep him company at geoff.lemon@theguardian.com. Back shortly. 11th over: Australia 47-2 (Warner 24, Stoinis 6) Target 326. George Dobell makes an interesting point on the radio: if Khawaja\u2019s hamstring problem is a strain rather than a tear, losing here buys him two extra days. A fascinating little twist this Australian tale seems to be taking here at Old Trafford. Three singles taken off Pretorious, all through the legside. Will Faf stick with Rabada for another? 10th over: Australia 44-2 (Warner 23, Stoinis 4) Target 326. Between overs, two things happen. One, a Mexican Wave. Two, Marcus Stoinis swallows a couple of tablets. That\u2019s the third time we\u2019ve seen the medicos out in the middle during this power play. They are truly up against it here now. Then again, this is precisely what Warner loves. He\u2019ll probably make 212 not out. Don\u2019t doubt it. The opener is out of the frying pan from the first Rabada ball with one to square leg. Can Stoinis get off the mark? He can, with a gorgeous drive on the up through extra cover. 9th over: Australia 39-2 (Warner 22, Stoinis 0) Target 326. Pretorious jags back at Stoinis, hitting his inside edge. The all-rounder plays out the rest, coninuing the process of getting his eye in. He\u2019s yet to score off nine deliveries so far. Now that India have done the job over Sri Lanka, I can confirm that if Australia lose, they will play England in Birmingham on Thursday. Deary me. 8th over: Australia 38-2 (Warner 22, Stoinis 0) Target 326. Back to Rabada versus Warner at the Statham End, which is proper BOX OFFICE. The quick finds his top edge pulling but fine leg is inside the ring so the ball falls safe! Just 10 metres inside the rope in front of the big red corporate box, rolling over the rope. He takes one to mid-on from the next ball to calm things down a tad and put Stoinis into the firing line for one delivery, the all-rounder defending it off the back foot. 7th over: Australia 33-2 (Warner 17, Stoinis 0) Target 326. Fantastic decision from Warner to advise Smith not to review, umpires call coming up on the TV technology, the ball just hitting the balls after just striking in line. Meanwhile, it\u2019s Marcus Stoinis into the middle during the power play. As Jarrod Kimber notes on the SEN radio call, he made his name as an early-overs slugger but rarely gets a chance in the first ten these days. Then again, that\u2019s not his role today. I wonder how close they were to sending Alex Carey out to join Warner? Australia in strife. Smith is given out lbw from Pretorious\u2019 second ball! It looks high and potentially hitting outside the line even, so he consults Warner... but the opener has advised him to keep walking. Can\u2019t wait to see the restrospective technology on this one! 6th over: Australia 29-1 (Warner 17, Smith 3) Target 326. I tell you what, lucky that the Australia \u2018A\u2019 squad are out here with Pete Handscomb ready to be pulled off the bench for the semi-final if Khawaja\u2019s injury is a serious one. We didn\u2019t pick up anything at the ground during the fielding innings. We have asked the CA media officer what the situation is, who replies that it is a \u201chamstring strain\u201d that is \u201ccurrently being assessed.\u201d Back in the middle, WARNER SMACKS RABADA FOR SIX OVER MIDWICKET! As you do! Slapped more than pulled. Compelling scenes! Brian Withington is worried that I\u2019m leaving the OBO full stop. Not at all! I\u2019ll be with you throughout the Ashes, both women and men. I love you guys. 5th over: Australia 20-1 (Warner 10, Smith 0) Target 326. Tahir into his third off the top. It doesn\u2019t take long for Khawaja to employ the reverse sweep, but picks out backward pont. He plays the conventional version of it next, into the deep for one. Hold on, at the end of that single Khawaja has called for the physio. He has RETIRED HURT! That left thigh he was strapping? Steve Smith is out there now, Warner playing out the couple of remaining deliveries. Big news, this. 4th over: Australia 18-1 (Warner 10, Khawaja 5) Target 326. Between overs, the medical staff are out with Khawaja, who is having his thigh restrapped. He\u2019s only been out there for a few balls. Slightly odd, but play on. Rabada\u2019s turn again and Warner is after him straight away, smashing the fast bowler off a length over cover for four. Shot. Sure enough, Rabada responds with a rapid bouncer. It says 142kph on the clock but forget that, this was quick with both of Warner\u2019s feet off the ground swaying out the way as the ball went past his grille. Exiting cricket, this. \u201cAhhh South Africa,\u201d emails Paul Rice. \u201cAlways raise their game against the \u201cabrasive\u201d Australian side. I wonder if Mr de Kock will have a few words for Mr Warner? Where was this batting performance in the last matches.\u201d I strongly doubt it, to answer your first question. I\u2019m certain both players are very happy to put that incident from Durban last year behind them. And yes, you\u2019re right, I am plugging a piece of mine from 18 months ago. 3rd over: Australia 13-1 (Warner 5, Khawaja 5) Target 326. Make no mistake, Australia are under all sorts of pressure here. Yes, they have been certain starters in the semi-finals for 11 days and had the last week off, but if they can\u2019t stick the landing on their group stage today, they have to move to Birmingham for a semi-final against England on Thursday. Both in terms of the logistics of moving and the opposition - New Zealand the alternative if they get up - this is serious stuff. Khawaja is off the mark with one to square leg then back on strike for the final delivery, which he duly hits down the ground with authority for a boundary. RUN IMRAN TAHIR, RUN! He sets off for a 100m dash with Finch giving catching practice off the back foot to Markram. Wickets don\u2019t come easier than that. 2nd over: Australia 5-0 (Warner 2, Finch 3) Target 326. Rabada is on and from his first ball Finch is playing well away from his body down to third man, no more than ten metres away from landing in the pouch of the fielder placed there. Warner\u2019s turn, and he\u2019s playing and missing. Singles follow to mid-off and square leg before Rabada cuts Warner in half. That\u2019s a fantastic over of fast bowling. This is a nervous start from the Australians. 1st over: Australia 2-0 (Warner 1, Finch 1) Target 326. Rabada should have ran Warner out! From the third ball, the left-hander took off after clipping to short fine leg but Finch said NO and rightly so. Had the throw been to his end rather than back to Tahir, it would have surely been curtains for Warner on zero. He\u2019s off strike next ball down to mid-off, Finch then getting his first run to square leg. The players are back on the field. Duminy and Tahir lead out South Africa in front of me, arm in arm, for the final innings of the ODI careers. A nice moment. And Tahir will be opening the attack with his leg spin; David Warner on strike. PLAY! Thanks, Geoff. I come to you slightly gutted that Rassie van der Dussen didn\u2019t make it three maiden tons in the final week from the game\u2019s young guns, Avishka Fernando and Nicholas Pooran saluting for the first time in this World Cup. What looks certain is that the South African number has a fine career ahead of him. One small query, though. Not about his batting but his treatment. Twice he was hit on the head by bouncers. The first of those, via Pat Cummins, was flush on the front of the lid. When the medical staff walked out to the middle, they were sent straight off by Umpire Dharmasena. Now, I know that RVDD didn\u2019t appear worried but surely he has to be given the once over before continuing? Anyway - I\u2019m glad he was not only fine but in outstanding nick in those final ten overs. This is my final OBO stint of the World Cup and it has been a wonderful experience talking to you throughout. Keep me company. Let\u2019s have some fun. If nothing else, this will be a good workout for Australia\u2019s batting ahead of the finals. They\u2019ve had a difficult time recently, with Shaun Marsh badly injured in the nets and Glenn Maxwell recovering. They made a real hash of their big chase against India at The Oval, and they were pretty ordinary in chasing a small total against Afghanistan. They\u2019ll have to do well today if they want to keep top spot, because India are romping past Sri Lanka in Leeds. South African fans meanwhile will be a combination of delighted and frustrated, wondering where this kind of batting was earlier in the tournament. But the question is also where were these surfaces. This one looks lovely for batting, lots of even bounce and the ability to play through the line. But at least this has been a good top-order performance, starting with the openers who got off to a flyer, then du Plessis and van der Dussen bringing it home. Australia have firepower, they might do this in a canter with Aaron Finch in the form of his life and David Warner a reliable foil. But it will be interesting to see how they approach it. An email question from Ruth Purdue: \u201cNow you\u2019re in my home city, what\u2019s your favourite ground in the World Cup, apart from Lord\u2019s?\u201d It may be heresy but I\u2019m not all that big on Lord\u2019s. For me it\u2019s a tie between Old Trafford and Edgbaston. The semi-final venues. Looking forward to both those games. We\u2019ll take a few minutes for a breather, then Adam Collins will handle innings two. Please direct your love and appreciation to him. Cheerio. 50th over: South Africa 325-6 (Phehlukwayo 4) Well, there was drama in the sub-plot with van der Dussen pulling a single first ball. Phehlukwayo got a full wide on and carved it away for four while probably just looking for a single, but hit it too well. He missed the next ball, but van der Dussen ran as soon as Cummins released it, and got through for a bye. Rassie then flicked two runs to midwicket and made it back for the second, but Cummins got through the batsman next ball, hitting his helmet and lobbing away to leg. They could have got a leg bye but didn\u2019t go for it. Final ball of the day, van der Dussen had to go for it. He ends on 95 from 97 balls, and made up beautifully for a slow start. He falls short! Goes for the glory shot from the final ball, pulling Cummins and striking it well, but not well enough to the long side. Maxwell is lurking back on the rope and doesn\u2019t drop outfield catches. 49th over: South Africa 317-5 (van der Dussen 92, Phehlukwayo 0) Starc finishes his work for the day without bowling his full ten, which you wouldn\u2019t have believed four hours ago. He was no good early but he found his way late. He does have his 25th and 26th wickets for the tournament, and he does continue his streak of taking a wicket in every match he\u2019s played here. That last spell was still going at 93 or 94 miles an hour, and still very full aside from the odd deliberate short ball. Phehlukwayo keeps out the final ball of the over, another fine yorker that bounces over his stumps after the squeezing defensive shot, and van der Dussen will have strike next over. He\u2019s had a dirty day, but he\u2019s cleaning up at the end. Finally Starc gets the line right, nice and full, a bit of reverse tweaking the line off straight, and Pretorius tries to go across the ball as so many have done before in the milliseconds before their doom. Zing go the bails, boys, clip clip clip. 48th over: South Africa 313-4 (van der Dussen 90, Pretorius 1) Cummins to bowl, btu starts with a wide. The gamble on a short batting line-up has worked for South Africa, with Pretorius listed too high at No6 but not having to come out until the 47th over. Rassie van der Dussen nearly runs himself out trying to get the strike back, coming too far down as Pretorius hits straight to Smith at cover. But Smith\u2019s throw misses, and gives away a run, allowing van der Dussen the chance to pull Pat Cummins for six! Huge, over the long side of the ground. The pitch is off-centre today, so it\u2019s a lot closer to the western edge than the eastern. But van der Dussen defies the advice of the Pet Shop Boys and goes east. He... dussen van der listen to anyone. Cummins tries to bounce him again but it\u2019s too high, and then the batsman pulls the next ball for four! This has been outstanding since his difficult start. He dinks two into the leg side by not hitting it too hard, then works a single to keep strike. One of the best bowlers in the biz goes for 16, South Africa go past 300, van der Dussen has a chance at a century to match his captain\u2019s. Standing ovation to that man in green. 47th over: South Africa 297-4 (van der Dussen 77, Pretorius 0) The next batsman to the crease is Dwayne Pre- Pre-, Pretorius, Pretorius. Non-striker\u2019s end, as van der Dussen pulls two runs from the last ball. Starc gets a late consolation. Great catch from Stoinis, running in from long on. Duminy had to go for it, pulling the short ball but toe-ending it a bit probably, for it to go quite straight but into the hands. The umpires are getting a replay to check the catch, but it\u2019s fine. Stoinis was coming in and around a bit, dived forward, got his hand under the ball. The crowd don\u2019t like it and give it a boo, assuming that it must have bounced, but that\u2019s just silly because it clearly landed on his fingers first. Lots of those replays are vague, but this one was clear. 46th over: South Africa 290-3 (van der Dussen 73, Duminy 11) Maxwell to bowl out, but Finch might have gone to the well once too often. Duminy only has one job, and he does it, crouching low to smear with a flat bat through cover for four. Really reached for it and got enough. Pulls a single, then van der Dussen opens his stance and blasts it straight for six! Imperious. Maxwell starts trying to bowl roundarm to confuse Rassie, who clips a brace, then a single, for the over to cost 14. Maxwell ends with 10 overs, 0-57. 45th over: South Africa 276-3 (van der Dussen 64, Duminy 6) Starc is back. He\u2019s battled today, with suggestions that he\u2019s got a sore knee. But he\u2019s landing his length right finally, in the yorker stage of the day. The line isn\u2019t perfect but the full balls at least make it hard to score more than singles. Five from the over. 44th over: South Africa 271-3 (van der Dussen 62, Duminy 3) Lyon\u2019s day is done, with 2-53 from his ten overs, and Maxwell is back with a couple of overs left up his sleeve. He bowls as well as ever, five singles and a wide, and has got through nine overs conceding 43. What will South Africa decide is enough? Just getting to 300 should be the main priority, to put that chasing pressure on. 43rd over: South Africa 265-3 (van der Dussen 60) Brilliant running from du Plessis to start the over. The very second that he turns Behrendroff off his pads he is sprinting, head down, never doubting that he\u2019ll come back as the ball runs softly towards the midwicket fielder charging in from the deep. They make it back for the second. He\u2019s on 99... and drives to long off for his hundred! It\u2019s his 12th overall, and his third fastest. But he won\u2019t go past that score \u2013 after van der Dussen sweeps the fast man into a gap behind square leg for four, then turns the strike over again, du Plessis gets a short ball that he has to go for, gets a thick top edge and it lobs up to short third man where Starc is waiting. 42nd over: South Africa 257-2 (du Plessis 97, van der Dussen 55) A classic of the genre: du Plessis slowing up a bit as he approaches a century. A few dots from Lyon before Faf gets off strike. But his partner makes up for it by reverse-lapping Lyon for four. Romeo is hoping for a South African win \u201cbecause if I wanted England to win the thing, I\u2019d rather they played Australia at Edgbaston, where they\u2019ve won 6 out of 11 ODIs between the two with two no-results. At Lord\u2019s, Australia have won 9 out of 15 with one tied and as I remember they\u2019ve always done very well at Lord\u2019s, at least since the Massie Test I was lucky enough to go to.\u201d 41st over: South Africa 251-2 (du Plessis 96, van der Dussen 51) Ten overs to go. Teams can get 100 from the last 10 if they\u2019re going well. But it almost starts terribly for South Africa, with van der Dussen nearly run out. He walks at Behrendorff, punches to mid-off and runs with the shot. Finch gathers and flicks at the stumps, hitting direct. It looks very much like the batsman is out. But the replay shows that his sprint from the second he hit the ball saved him. He dives full length, and just gets the toe of the bat into his ground before the stumps light up. And that\u2019s the 50th run for van der Dussen. Six from the over in the end including a brace for du Plessis. 40th over: South Africa 245-2 (du Plessis 92, van der Dussen 49) Cummins decides to try bowling properly short, and it works. Rassie van der Dussen gets a lucky top edge for one, then bails out of another pull, then misses a third. Four singles from the over, a tidy one for an Australian seamer for once. 39th over: South Africa 241-2 (du Plessis 90, van der Dussen 47) What a shot from van der Dussen! He\u2019s not late to the party; he\u2019s been at the part for ages, he\u2019s just been sitting in the corner sulking and not talking to anyone. But suddenly he\u2019s jumped on the floor with a fresh repertoire of moves from Breakdance II: Electric Boogaloo. He walks at Behrendorff, arrives at the ball, then whips it off his pads and high over square leg for six. That was... attractive. Unsettlingly so. 38th over: South Africa 231-2 (du Plessis 88, van der Dussen 39) They\u2019ve obviously got a policy of more caution against spin in this innings. Again, I wonder where Smith has been, or even Finch, and Lyon\u2019s last two overs. Maxwell gets through another for four singles, and has conceded 37 from 48 balls even with that six last over. 37th over: South Africa 227-2 (du Plessis 86, van der Dussen 37) Behrendorff hasn\u2019t been seen since the 13th over, but here he is at last. He\u2019s tight on the stumps, and they only manage a couple of singles from the first few balls. This will not stand, decides Faf du Plessis. Gets a ball back of a length and muscles it past mid-on for four. Airborne but straight enough, the short-arm jab, not timed but with Finch up in the circle it goes for four anyway. The next ball, fuller, gives Faf the chance for a fuller swing, and he gets a cleaner lofted connection for four more! These two are not slowing down. 36th over: South Africa 217-2 (du Plessis 77, van der Dussen 36) Away we go for six more! Maxwell has been going at 4 runs per over to this point, but his seventh over may have been one too many. Van der Dussen hasn\u2019t looked great today, and he\u2019s still going slowly, but he\u2019s tried to lift the rate there, skipping down to launch Maxwell straight and high. That was a big one. Nine from the over with some singles. 35th over: South Africa 208-2 (du Plessis 75, van der Dussen 29) The frontliners are being hit alright! Lyon comes back on for Cummins, and du Plessis drops to one knee and plants him over midwicket for six more. Right out of the middle again, that sounded lush. Singles, ten from the over, the 200 up with 90 balls to go. South Africa don\u2019t bat deep in meaningful terms but their all-rounders can hit. They could be on for a really big one today. Drinks. 34th over: South Africa 198-2 (du Plessis 68, van der Dussen 26) Maxwell for his sixth, and again it\u2019s five runs. Singles, a two when deep backward square is slow to get around. So the frontliners are being hit and the support bowlers are having the quiet time. 33rd over: South Africa 193-2 (du Plessis 65, van der Dussen 24) Faf du Plessis has a lot of respect for Pat Cummins. I interviewed him after the Test series last year and quoted some of it in my book. \u201cHe\u2019s an exceptional player. We would sit on the side of the field and just admire what he does. We\u2019d say, \u2018Look at the guy, he\u2019s still running in and bowling quick.\u2019 Diving at balls when he\u2019s just finished an eight-over spell, runs in the series. As a batter I definitely felt he was the biggest challenge. He\u2019s a nice guy, Pat. You enjoy it when nice guys do well, even opposition, the good people of the game. We\u2019re looking forward to having a beer now with the Australian team.\u201d And now in Manchester, Faf advances and smashes Cummins straight for six! That\u2019s how much he likes Cummins today. Walks down at one of the fastest in the world and hits him dead straight, onto the black shade cloth covering the seats at the Pavilion end. The ball rolls back down the slope. Then du Plessis hangs back and hacks through cover with an angled bat as he did earlier, for another four. 32nd over: South Africa 179-2 (du Plessis 53, van der Dussen 24) Maxwell burgles another over for four singles. He\u2019ll be out the laundry window before you know it. 31st over: South Africa 175-2 (du Plessis 51, van der Dussen 22) Mitchell Starc is down on his haunches for a moment here, looking discomfited. An injury to him would be quite literally the last thing Australia would want, even if he\u2019s been off the boil today. Rassie hands the strike over to Faf, who drives a single to raise his minor milestone. Excellent innings at just about a run a ball. Five from the over with a few singles and a leg bye. 30th over: South Africa 170-2 (du Plessis 49, van der Dussen 20) Maxwell zips through another over for three singles. He\u2019s loving this, just 14 from his 24 balls so far. Steal another couple and he will have had a great day even before he bats. 29th over: South Africa 167-2 (du Plessis 48, van der Dussen 18) That\u2019s just rude from du Plessis! Starc returns, all is quiet, no wides, an early single. The South African captain plays out four balls with due respect and care. Then the last ball of the over, he camps on the back foot and flays through cover for four! Back-foot punch with an angled blade and a flourish after the stroke, just beating the field. On the slow-mo replay, Faf is a picture: lime-green shirt, hot pink gloves, forearms like knotted rope. I hope he doesn\u2019t retire. 28th over: South Africa 162-2 (du Plessis 44, van der Dussen 17) Faf is running the doubles like an American barkeep. Taking Maxwell through square leg, then through point. Hustling back. Five from the over thanks to a Rassie single first ball, managing to actually drive a spinner for a risk-free run. He\u2019s much happier against pace, clearly. 27th over: South Africa 157-2 (du Plessis 40, van der Dussen 16) Stoinis gets a lot of wickets with the short ball, and Rassie nearly becomes another one but doesn\u2019t hit his pull well enough to reach deep square leg. He does drive a full toss through cover for four. \u201cHi Geoff,\u201d emails John Barnes. \u201cI was surprised that there was rain about earlier today and thought I\u2019d take a look at Edgbaston for Thursday. Er, looks like there might not be a game even with a reserve day! What happens in that case? Does the higher team go through or is it head to heads? Christ I hope there\u2019s a game. I can see England being bundled out because of the bloody weather.\u201d John, I knew that no one would have read the entire 88-page playing conditions document except for Alison Mitchell of the BBC, so I asked her. She\u2019s confirmed that an abandoned semi-final will be awarded to the higher team on the table, and an abandoned final means a shared trophy. Cut it in half, I guess? Your team won the W r d u and ours won the o l C p? 26th over: South Africa 148-2 (du Plessis 38, van der Dussen 9) Maxwell gets through a quiet over for four runs. They\u2019ll want to be a bit more proactive against Maxwell, I would have thought. 25th over: South Africa 144-2 (du Plessis 35, van der Dussen 8) Stoinis with his medium pace, and the batsmen are happy to work him around. Ones and twos, a wide for a bouncer. If only Markram were still out there, he was exquisite to watch today. Nothing gold can stay. 24th over: South Africa 136-2 (du Plessis 31, van der Dussen 5) There you have it! Rassie looking desperate, sees Maxwell the part-time off-spinner bowling and wants to crash him for six. Comes down, beaten on the outside edge by a quicker ball, and it\u2019s a missed stumping. The ball crashed into Carey, maybe his wrists or his chest even with some bounce and pace, but there was no nick on it. The gloveman should have taken that, unfortunately. Maxwell is playing today being smashed on the arm by Starc in the same net session where Cummins broke Shaun Marsh\u2019s arm. But Maxwell has come good. Three singles from his over. 23rd over: South Africa 133-2 (du Plessis 29, van der Dussen 4) It\u2019s fifth-bowler time. Finch has decided he needs some from his second liners, so Maxwell is warming up while Stoinis comes on to bowl. A quiet over as the batsmen have a look at him, just a couple of singles. They\u2019ve got some latitude to take their time, and van der Dussen has looked scratchy all day. 22nd over: South Africa 131-2 (du Plessis 28, van der Dussen 3) Lyon very nearly gets through another tight over, two runs and a leg bye, but from the last ball du Plessis comes forward and drives him through cover for four. Top shot. South Africa need those sort of strokes, to make sure their early initiative doesn\u2019t drift away. 21st over: South Africa 124-2 (du Plessis 23, van der Dussen 3) Cummins has hit van der Dussen! Flush on the helmet with a short ball. Rassie tried to hook and missed, very late on the shot. There\u2019s a curious lack of response. The batsman just shakes his head and carries on. The bowler just turns and walks back. The medical staff don\u2019t appear. They try to come on at the end of the over but the batsman waves them back. Surely they have to at least check him? That was solid contact to the side of the head. 20th over: South Africa 122-2 (du Plessis 22, van der Dussen 2) Faf drives a single from Lyon\u2019s first ball, but after that the spinner is all over van der Dussen. He nearly yorks the batsman at one stage, and Rassie is very uncomfortable and is entirely engaged in just keeping Lyon out. Five dot balls. 19th over: South Africa 121-2 (du Plessis 21, van der Dussen 2) Cummins starting to get some assistance from the wicket as the ball wears, which is curious. He nips one back in to van der Dussen that nearly cleans up the stumps. Du Plessis isn\u2019t sure about the pace of Cummins\u2019 short balls, either, lumping a couple away towards point for a two and then a three, but not with any conviction. \u201cUp in Leeds, Geoff. We win at Northernness,\u201d emails Jon Millard. \u201cYes, yes, complete massacre on the Football, before of them points that out. And the music, to be fair. And rain...\u201d 18th over: South Africa 115-2 (du Plessis 16, van der Dussen 1) There\u2019s what Lyon brings to the team. The quicks all get belted, the track looks lovely for batting, the outfield is lightning, and he says give the ball to me, I\u2019ll sort this out. Brakes on. Both openers gone. Rassie van der Dussen is next out, right-handed as is Faf du Plessis. Lyon flights the ball to Rassie immediately. Lyon again! De Kock wants to take him down, and goes for a huge hoy over the leg side. Spin, takes the outside edge after straightening from around the wicket, and the ball goes high and drops comfortably into the hands of Starc at backward point around about the fielding circle line. 17th over: South Africa 112-1 (de Kock 51, du Plessis 15) Here\u2019s fun, Steve Smith is going to bowl. He took a wicket against New Zealand, with Colin de Grandhomme punting the first ball he\u2019d faced from Smith to long-off. Smith starts, not really short but on leg stump and de Kock almost does the splits to get low enough to pull that ball regardless, and hits it well for four. \u201cHang on, I thought Ashley Giles was the King of Spain?\u201d writes Andrew Thomas regarding El Rey. I don\u2019t know what El Rey is El Rey of. El Rey of Sunshine, perhaps? 16th over: South Africa 107-1 (de Kock 46, du Plessis 15) De Kock doesn\u2019t want to let the momentum shift. He drops to one knee facing Lyon and plays a scoop shot fine for four. Well timed. Drinks. \u201cMonitoring the excellent coverage from a damp and rainy Sydney,\u201d writes Jonothan Holt. \u201cQuery for you. If a fielder hits the stumps with a direct throw they get the run out credit \u2013 all good. However if the fielder\u2019s throw is gathered by the wicketkeeper who breaks the stumps why is it still the fielder\u2019s credit and not the wicketkeepers? Seems a bit unfair (as an ex-keeper myself!)\u201d As far as I know there\u2019s no formal credit for run-outs in basic stats archives. You\u2019ll find a record of catches but not run-outs. Which has always seemed weird. But where you see them listed on scorecards, there\u2019s a fair bit of latitude for interpretation. I\u2019ve seen plenty listed as fielder/keeper both, and some listed with three players where there\u2019s a relay throw. But those scorecard entries don\u2019t correlate to a stats column as far as I know. Individual databases like CricViz are the ones who\u2019ve started tracking fielding involvement in more detail. 15th over: South Africa 102-1 (de Kock 41, du Plessis 15) Back comes Starc. Can he get his game together this time around? Well, he doesn\u2019t bowl five wides. Instead his line is sufficiently improved that it clips the pad and goes for four leg byes instead. Marginal gains? Again he over-corrects with width, and du Plessis drives square for four. \u201cI have to say, the Aussies are rather going around the park,\u201d says Jonathan Agnew on the BBC, definitely not at all like someone who might be finding the sight enjoyable. Here\u2019s another for him, as du Plessis drives through extra cover for four! Top shot. Starc has 0-34 from four overs, and South Africa have their hundred up. 14th over: South Africa 90-1 (de Kock 41, du Plessis 7) Inside edged past the stumps! De Kock is nearly bowled as Lyon bowls around the wicket and angles in towards the left-hander. Survives. They milk the spinner rather than attacking now. 13th over: South Africa 84-1 (de Kock 38, du Plessis 4) Some calm returns to the field of play. Du Plessis chops a short ball through cover and gets three, as Cummins tippy-toes inside the rope trying not to kick it as he saves. Sri Lanka have reached 267 at Headingley, with Angelo Mathews making a hundred. 12th over: South Africa 80-1 (de Kock 37, du Plessis 1) Well, you wonder whether Markram\u2019s slight tentativeness in the last couple of overs brought his undoing. He\u2019d been so positive and assured before that, and if he\u2019d come down to that ball or gone back to attack it, he might have defused it. Against the run of play, Nathan Lyon does the trick! Sure, he\u2019s been hit for six, but he\u2019s held his nerve. Flights the ball again in this over, draws Markram forward and dips it on him. Markram\u2019s back foot is dragged an inch out of his ground, and there\u2019s no way to get back before Carey has the bails off. The third umpire confirms a clear-cut call. 11th over: South Africa 78-0 (Markram 34, de Kock 36) Australia finally gets out of the first ten overs. Runs ahoy. Cummins to de Markram, who knocks a single, then de Kock who flicks three runs. Cummins bowls a wide way over Markram\u2019s head. Then the batsman is defending up on his toes. I think Markram has made the assessment that they\u2019re off to a wonderful start, and he just wants to rein it in now and make sure he doesn\u2019t play one shot too many. Tries to glide past backward point but Maxwell is too fast. \u201cI am backing Proteas to get a result today when it least matters most,\u201d writes John Norris. \u201cSure they haven\u2019t really clicked, but you should know more than most that past performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance, Geoff.\u201d Ha. That\u2019s a sly reference to the Final Word podcast which has been running through the World Cup. Emma John\u2019s Guardian podcast The Spin has been a lot of fun as well. 10th over: South Africa 73-0 (Markram 33, de Kock 33) Behrendorff bowls and Markram misses and is hit on the thigh pad. Then gets tangled in his next shot. Then hits the next to cover. Three dot balls, what is this? Straight to point. Four dot balls. Fielded by the bowler. Five! Could this be a maiden? No, a single from the last ball. But a good comeback from Behrendorff. 9th over: South Africa 72-0 (Markram 32, de Kock 33) De Kock is going stroke for stroke with Markram now, and passes his teammate\u2019s score by cutting another boundary from Cummins. Crisp again. 8th over: South Africa 66-0 (Markram 32, de Kock 27) Lyon for his second over, and Markram skips down and drives him for six! Over long on, 85 metres into the camera area at ground level. What a knock from Markram already. Then he dinks a single, and de Kock pushes another. Lyon darts the ball through, almost bowling inswingers rather than off-breaks. Australia rattled. \u201cOn your point of Hashim Amla possibly playing his last ODI, I wonder if it may well be Faf\u2019s last match as well?\u201d writes Ranjit Unnithan. \u201cHis comments at the pre-match presser certainly didn\u2019t exclude the possibility. If so, he will be missed - one of the most underrated cricketers in world cricket! But it certainly looks the end for many - Tahir, Duminy - but possibly Faf, Amla, Steyn and even Ottis?\u201d Yes, very much an era\u2019s end for South Africa. I think Faf may stay on a bit longer to help ease that transition. But we\u2019ll see. 7th over: South Africa 57-0 (Markram 25, de Kock 25) Now they get some ballet involved. Cummins bowls his first ball, de Kock smacks a straight drive for four, and Markram at the far end has to do a theatrical spinning fall to get out of the way. I think he was more concerned with not stopping a boundary rather than his own safety, because he twirled to make sure he got no touch, rather than trying to protect himself. It works, and the ball goes straight for four. Then another drive on the up to the cover boundary! What a display of strokeplay! The batsmen have 25 apiece, after Australia donated the first few runs of the day. Seven overs and 57 on the board. Whoosh. 6th over: South Africa 48-0 (Markram 25, de Kock 16) Jim Maxwell is on BBC radio. \u201cThis ground, if it didn\u2019t have a boundary, the ball would roll into the North Sea.\u201d Value for shots today. Aaron Finch turns to Nathan Lyon, hoping that spin will slow the South Africans, but Markram produces a perfect straight drive for four. 5th over: South Africa 42-0 (Markram 20, de Kock 15) Now Quinton de Kock is joining the party! Starc serves him up a tray of hors d\u2019oeuvres first up to be fair, and Quinny stuffs himself with a leg glance from the leg stump line. But his next shot isn\u2019t to buffet bowling, its Quinton rushing into the kitchen and seizing a steak off the open flame. Decent length, on the up, but he drives it cleanly through cover nonetheless for four. 4th over: South Africa 34-0 (Markram 20, de Kock 7) Glorious shot from Markram! Behrendorff gives him a bit of width, but there must be been telepathy. Markram clears his front leg early, shuffles to open up the angle for himself, and carves it away for four! Third man is back, but that back-cut beats him easily into the rope. Outstanding. Then Markram hops on the front dog and laces a cover drive for the same result. Those shots were pure Outkast, just so fresh and clean. 3rd over: South Africa 25-0 (Markram 12, de Kock 6) A bit more controlled from Starc this time, clipped for a two and a one by de Kock, and just the one wide this time, well outside off stump this time. Radar still processing, though he produces a good yorker. 2nd over: South Africa 21-0 (Markram 12, de Kock 3) I neglected to mention, apologies, that Hashim Amla is missing after a knock on the knee. I wonder if we\u2019ve seen him play his last ODI for South Africa. The replacement is the left-arm wrist spinner Tabraiz Shamsi, and everyone else shuffles up the order, with the all-rounders Pretorious, Phehlukwayo and Morris starting from No6. Behrendorff will bowl, left-arm swing from both ends. He\u2019s picked off by de Kock for two off the pads, then one to point, and Markram finishes the over with a cover drive for four. He played a belter against Australia in the Durban Test last year, did Markram, in the fourth innings. All cuts and cover drives. Looking in top touch today. 1st over: South Africa 14-0 (Markram 8, de Kock 0) South Africa score six runs with one ball bowled. Not because Markram has smashed it over the rope, but because Starc bowls five wides, a dot ball, then another wide. He\u2019s bowling fast, 90 miles an hour from the off. But not accurately. When he finally corrects to the off side, Markram drives him on the bounce over point for four, then cuts another four. Quite the start from Starc! Not in a good way. Anthem time. Who doesn\u2019t love an anthem? With the mascot kids and the players and the big balloon. Some of these kids look relatively old compared to the usual, I wonder how they feel at being made to hold hands with grizzled cricketers. Reeza Hendricks has to take two mascot kids because he\u2019s last in line and someone hasn\u2019t done their maths. It\u2019s all a bit Pied Piper for me. And as someone smarter than me once said, if there\u2019s one lesson from the Pied Piper it\u2019s: pay your freelancers. Mitchell Starc will have first use of the ball today. If you still need something to fill in your time, here\u2019s a long piece that I wrote in appreciation of his Ben Stokes yorker. This is my highest ever words-per-delivery ratio, by the way. Cheers for Faf du Plessis, who calls correctly. Bat first, the sensible method. And why not? Australia have only chased twice in this tournament, and they lost to India and were very sluggish against Afghanistan in so doing. \u201cShould be a great match,\u201d writes El Rey. To those who don\u2019t speak Spanish, The King. Humble chap. \u201cIs a preamble preliminary to an amble?\u201d I think it\u2019s more of a preliminary amble, Your Grace. That makes sense to me etymologically, because a preamble is an early stroll through a garden of ideas before you get down to the serious labour in the furrows of the main text. An idea is a seed, ready to be planted. If you want to keep up to date with the India-Sri Lanka match while we wait, Tim de Lisle can take care of you. Updates from Manchester: there was a smattering of rain earlier this morning, and there\u2019s still some thick cloud and a very humid atmosphere. But there are patches of blue as well and the sun is breaking through here and there. Hopefully we have no interruptions. Both teams are out there warming up at the moment with nets and practice stumps and all kinds of equipment out on the ground, it\u2019s very busy out there with the blue-and-orange shirted ground staff and some broadcasters and security and umpires. High traffic area. Drop me a line. The usual communication lines are open. Email is good, isn\u2019t it? geoff.lemon@theguardian.com, or on Twitter using @GeoffLemonSport. Hop in. Good morning or other time of day to you all, and welcome to Old Trafford. So much better than New Trafford. (Is there a New Trafford?) It\u2019s the final day of the World Cup group stage. Not to be confused with a finals day, which is when finals will be played. Australia and India will both play on this final day and a subsequent finals day, but South Africa and Sri Lanka will play today but no further. India and Sri Lanka are playing right now down in Leeds (up in Leeds? Sideways in Leeds?) and then Australia v South Africa will start at 13:30 local British time. There\u2019s still a bit to play for, for the finalists. If Australia win, they get to chill out here in Manchester before their semi-final, then have a couple more days to relax before the final should they qualify. If Australia lose and India win, India will go top of the table and get the Manchester semi, which will be against the theoretically easier opponent New Zealand rather than England in Birmingham. Plenty to play for then. As for South Africa, they\u2019ve had a miserable tournament, and there\u2019s been a fair amount of pillorying and apologising and all that sort of thing, which seems entirely over the top for a sporting event. But at least if they can get a win today, they\u2019ll have a more cheerful note to go home on.",

      "bodyText": "Nope! That\u2019s it! Egypt are knocked out of their own Africa Cup of Nations. It\u2019s a thoroughly deserved result, too. South Africa were the better team from the get-go, solid in defence and always dangerous in attack. The Cairo International Stadium falls silent, much like the Maracana did after the final match of the 1950 World Cup, I\u2019ll be bound. What a shock! Mohamed Salah looks crestfallen, but can have no complaints. To a man, Egypt were thoroughly second best tonight. Congratulations to South Africa; commiserations to the hosts. Thanks for reading! 90 min +4: Veldwijk is immediately sent clear down the inside-right channel. He\u2019s one on one with El Shenawy, but can\u2019t convert. Will South Africa live to regret giving up that gilt-edged opportunity? 90 min +3: And the clock ticks on further as Veldwijk comes on for the goalscorer Lorch ... who is nearly manhandled off the field by an irate Trezeguet. 90 min +2: Furman\u2019s number goes up on the subs board. He takes his own sweet time to depart, causing Hamed all manner of head-heat. Furman eventually departs, and he\u2019s replaced by Kekana. 90 min: Mokotjo romps into space down the left. He should find Lau free in the centre, but clanks his cross into Hegazy. That would have sealed it. As things stand, though, there will be four added minutes in which Egypt can save themselves. 89 min: Tau departs momentarily on the medical truck. Salah taps his wrist theatrically, the internationally recognised mime for \u201cAdd some effing time on, ref!\u201d 88 min: Tau is down. He\u2019s either injured, wants a rest, is running down the clock, or is trying his best to irritate the desperate hosts. Maybe all four. 87 min: The crowd gather themselves and turn up the volume again. Can they push their impotent heroes on? They\u2019re not worried now! Two passes out from the back, and Mothiba is racing down the right in acres, with Lorch free in the middle! No idea where Egypt\u2019s defence has gone. But they\u2019re not there. Lorch opens his body and rams a shot past El Shenawy and into the bottom right! The stadium falls silent in the style of the Maracana 1950. The hosts are on the verge of crashing out! 84 min: A little better from Egypt, as Soliman immediately gets involved down the right, linking up with Elmohamady and Salah. They can\u2019t quite open South Africa up, but for a second the visitors were worried. 83 min: Egypt make their last swap of the regulation 90 minutes. Soliman comes on for Elneny. 81 min: Salah goes chasing after a long punt down the right, but is beaten to the ball by Williams, who comes off his line, claims, then sets South Africa on the attack. Mothiba crosses from the right, and Tau is penalised for over-excited play in the box. 80 min: Ah no, Salah leaves it to Warda at the last moment. Warda floats a godawful free kick into the box, easy pickings for Williams. Even if Egypt do get through tonight, they don\u2019t look like champions. They\u2019ve been incredibly poor. 79 min: He\u2019ll get another go from a similar spot, because Zungu is booked for a hysterical lunge on Warda. 78 min: A free kick for Egypt out on the left. They load the box. Salah takes, and fails to beat the first man. That was dismal. 77 min: Warda turns in from the left and whips a shot well wide of goal. He hardly had any space to work with. The South African defence has been super-solid tonight. 76 min: A contested drop ball in the middle of the park, after play is stopped so Mokotjo can get some treatment. A rare spot these days. 74 min: Salah backs himself in a footrace with Hlanti down the right ... and loses. Egypt can\u2019t get anything going. A lot of their players are visibly anxious. Their cup hopes could be going south here, quite literally. 72 min: A gorgeous move down the right, Mkhize in the centre of a series of one-twos that finally release Lorch into the box. He slams a shot towards the bottom right. El Shenawy parries and claims with safe hands. That was delicious football from South Africa. 70 min: Now it\u2019s South Africa\u2019s turn to pass up a golden opportunity to score. Hlanti swings the free kick towards the far post. Hlatshwayo rises highest and plants a header inches wide of the left-hand post. What a chance! He holds his head in despair. 69 min: Ashraf is booked for a late lunge on Mokotjo, who requires a little treatment as a result. It\u2019s going to be a free kick out on the right. 68 min: Salah is at least looking a little livelier now. Elneny scoops a pass down the right, and he scampers after it, forcing Mkhwanazi into conceding a cheap corner. Nothing happens from the set piece, though, because Williams flaps in a crowded area, and gets his goalkeeper\u2019s decision. 66 min: It\u2019s not, though. It\u2019s sent flat along the face of the Egyptian box, and easily cleared. Trezeguet races into acres of space on the counter, and very nearly releases Salah with a wedge down the inside-left channel. Mkhize does very well to read the danger and intercept. 65 min: A free kick for South Africa out on the right. Hlanti to take. This better be an improvement on that last atrocity. 64 min: Egypt make their second change, hooking El Said and sending on Warda. 63 min: A long ball down the middle panics Mkhize, who heads out for a corner under pressure from Ali. El Said to take the corner. The delivery is awful, and easily cleared. Hamed then shoots from the best part of 40 yards, which rather obviously signals Egyptian frustration. 61 min: Tau knocks the ball past Alaa down the right, in the playground style, then chases after it. He wins the race with the defender, but can\u2019t catch up with the ball, failing by the width of a cigarette paper to keep it in play. 60 min: Hlanti fires the ball into the top left ... of the stand behind the goal. That was ludicrously off target. A preposterous effort. What a waste. 59 min: Hamed clips Mokotjo to the ground, 30 yards from goal. The resulting free kick is just right of centre. Hlanti to take. Everyone else on the edge of the box. 57 min: Ali flashes a wild one over the bar. But then Egypt come back at South Africa, and should really open the scoring. Salah, deep and cutting in from the right, rolls a stunning diagonal pass between the South African central defenders to release Trezeguet into the box, just to the left of goal. Trezeguet is one on one with Williams, and shapes to sidefoot into the bottom right ... but once again slaps a lame effort straight at the keeper. The best chance of the match. 56 min: Salah picks up a loose ball and bursts down the right. But Hlanti has his number, and barges him off the ball. The crowd are slipping into a frustrated funk. Their team have achieved very little tonight. 54 min: Salah has a belt from distance. It\u2019s blocked. Egypt\u2019s star man has been extremely quiet. 53 min: El Said wedges a ball over the top for Ali, who nearly gets clear of Mkhize. But the defender keeps strong and the striker can\u2019t get a sniff. South Africa have been superb in defence. They\u2019ve only conceded twice in the tournament so far. Egypt of course yet to let one in. We possibly shouldn\u2019t be too surprised that it\u2019s still 0-0. 51 min: Mkhwanazi launches long down the left and releases Lorch into an awful lot of space. Lorch lets Egypt off the hook by taking a heavy touch and running the ball out of play for a goal kick. There was danger for Egypt there. 50 min: Now it\u2019s Egypt\u2019s turn to whip in a cross. Elmohamady hoicks one in from the right, with Trezeguet waiting at the far post. But there\u2019s far too much juice on the ball. Goal kick. 49 min: Space for Mokotjo down the left. He hooks into the box. El Shenawy goes well to punch clear under pressure from his own players ... and wins a free kick anyway. Goalkeepers are a protected species all right. 47 min: Egypt have obviously been given a rocket, though. Trezeguet bustles his way past Furman, then feeds Elneny, who strides purposefully towards the box and whistles a rising shot inches over the crossbar. Were that on target, it was nestling in the top left, and Williams wasn\u2019t getting there. 46 min: Lorch is quickly up and at Egypt again, rolling his way down the left wing before sending across a fairly aimless pass to nobody. Here we go again! South Africa get the second half underway. Egypt have made one half-time change, withdrawing Mohsen and sending on Ahmed Ali. Half-time entertainment. Other international tournaments are available. To this end, here\u2019s Hope Solo on tomorrow\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup final ... ... and Jonathan Wilson on Peru, the underdogs in the final tie of the Copa America. The South Africans have looked dangerous. The hosts have not. 45 min: Salah tries to cream a diagonal shot into the top left. It\u2019s well wide, and Williams had it covered anyway. 44 min: Hlanti is booked for a slide tackle that results in his standing on Salah\u2019s foot. Salah isn\u2019t happy with the challenge and for a second it briefly threatens to kick off. But it\u2019s just a yellow card, and a free kick just to the right of centre, 25 yards out. 43 min: Egypt enjoy a bit of sterile possession in the midfield. It\u2019s not what the punters want to see, but in truth they could do with hearing the half-time whistle, so it\u2019s not a bad ploy. 41 min: Salah tries to sprint past Mkhwanazi down the right, but runs out of room. He wants a free kick as the pair tussle, but the decision goes the other way. Salah, beyond livid, smashes a shot towards the side netting in anger and frustration. He\u2019s very fortunate not to get himself booked. 39 min: Tau slips a pass down the inside-right channel for Lorch, who is denied a shot on goal by El Shenawy, out quickly to challenge. The next phase leads to a corner that causes quite the scramble. Egypt eventually clear, but they are rocking. 38 min: Another Egyptian attack fizzles out into nothingness. Salah has been quiet; Trezeguet, one fine run apart, fairly ineffectual. If they don\u2019t get their gamefaces on, and quick, they could be going out tonight. 36 min: A deep cross into the Egyptian box from the left. Hegazy misjudges it. Lorch takes up possession and sends a screamer goalwards from a tight angle. The shot hits Ashraf\u2019s upper arm, but he had both of his arms behind his back, and the referee\u2019s not interested in a clearly accidental incident. Then South Africa come again, Mokotjo sending a low fizzer inches wide of the left-hand post. Bafana Bafana have been by far the better team. 34 min: A free kick for South Africa out on the right. Hlanti whips it into the Egyptian area. Mohsen heads clear. South Africa take an age over the resulting throw. Nothing comes of it, but they\u2019re doing a fine job of disrupting Egypt\u2019s rhythm and frustrating the hosts. 33 min: A period of scrappy play. South Africa will be much the happier of the two teams. Egypt just haven\u2019t got going. 31 min: Elmohamady has time and space down the inside-right. Salah is begging for the ball to his right. Elmohamady instead rolls a pass across the face of the box, hoping to tee up El Said for a shot. Mkhize is wise to Elmohamady\u2019s game, though, and steps in to intercept with ease. Egypt are strangely ponderous in attack. 29 min: Mothiba\u2019s presence on the edge of the Egyptian box creates panic, and a little space for his strike partner Lorch, on the right-hand edge of the D. Lorch swivels and sends a speculative snapshot inches wide of the left-hand post. The crowd are beginning to get a little pensive now. South Africa have come the closest to scoring, on more than a couple of occasions to boot. 28 min: Egypt nearly open up South Africa with the cutest move of the match so far. Trezeguet drives down the inside-left channel and crisply one-twos with Mohsen, but just as it looks as though there\u2019s a route into the box, Mkhize and Hlatshwayo slam the door shut. 26 min: A free kick for Egypt out on the left. El Said to take, with everyone else on the edge of the box. Mkhize heads clear with power. Suddenly South Africa are on the counter, with Egypt light, but Mokotjo and Lorch make some poor choices and the chance to trouble the hosts is gone. I\u2019m not quite sure how this is still goalless, because both teams really are going for it. 24 min: ... Egypt should score. A simple blooter clear suddenly finds Salah leading a three-on-two charge, South Africa having seriously over-committed at the corner. Salah could take a shot on himself from the edge of the box, having run half the length of the pitch with the ball himself. But he opts to roll in Trezeguet to his right. Trezeguet\u2019s clear in the box ... and he rolls a dismally soft effort straight at Williams, who does extremely well not to burst out laughing. That was awful. 23 min: The corner from the left is worked to the right flank. Furman loops into the mixer, forcing El Shenawy into a desperate tip away from a crowded six-yard box. Another corner. From which ... 22 min: Lorch stands over it. He\u2019s preparing to take. But then he wanders off, and Tau whips a glorious effort over the wall and towards the top left. El Shenawy, who has been in decent form in this tournament, tips over the bar. Nothing was expected of South Africa tonight, but they\u2019re right in this match. 21 min: Lorch and Mokotjo busy themselves 25 yards from the Egyptian goal. Eventually an Egyptian leg extends in frustration and clips Mokotjo over. A free kick in a very dangerous central position. 19 min: South Africa have been excellent so far. It\u2019s the sort of performance that would, in most other stadiums, have quietened the crowd. Not here. Not this one. The atmosphere is fantastic. 17 min: A long diagonal pass by Elneny sets Salah scampering down the right. He\u2019s in space, but his cross is no good. Egypt may be the hosts and hot favourites to win this match, but they aren\u2019t quite clicking at the moment. South Africa are giving as good as they\u2019re getting. 15 min: A poor touch by Furman allows Salah to break upfield with great intent. He\u2019s got Mohsen to his left, and should play him in on goal with an easy pass. But Salah\u2019s pass is poor, behind his team-mate, and South Africa are allowed to go up the other end themselves, Tau cutting in from the right again and looking for the top right from 25 yards. He stings El Shenawy\u2019s hands, a fine effort. 13 min: Salah drops deep and wedges a pass down the inside-right channel for El Said. There\u2019s just too much weight on the ball, which was a shame for Egypt as El Said had sprung the offside trap with a perfectly timed burst. 11 min: A brief break in play as Hamed gets some treatment. It looks like Mothiba accidentally stood on his trouser arrangement as he made his challenge. That\u2019s gotta hurt. 10 min: Mothiba tears at great speed down the right, and for a second it looks like he\u2019s breaking clear. Hamed slides in, though, to stop him with a desperate last-ditch tackle. Mothiba performs a spectacular triple roll in the hope of winning a free kick on the edge of the box, but it\u2019s a fair tackle, just, and Egypt clear their lines. 8 min: El Said takes possibly the worst free kick in the entire history of the sport. With the box loaded, he hoofs the ball from a position tight on the byline as hard as he can, miles over the heads of everyone in the area, and out of play for a goal kick. That really was appalling. Such good work from Trezeguet to win the free kick, as well. 7 min: Some sloppy play by South Africa in the midfield, and Trezeguet is allowed to showcase his skills down the left. He draws a foul from Mkhize, and this is a free kick that\u2019s essentially a corner. 5 min: Salah slips a pass down the right for Elmohamady, who from the byline cuts the ball back into the box. A deflection sends the ball straight to Salah, just inside the area. He has a first-time flash towards the bottom right, but it nicks off a defender and out for a corner. Nothing comes of the resulting set piece, but that was a very decent chance for Salah, and he really should have done better. 3 min: This is a very hectic start. Mohsen sends a shot straight at Williams. Then up the other end, Tau sashays in from the right and peals a shot over the bar from 25 yards. Well over in the end, but it was a fantastic run. 2 min: Trezeguet works his way down the left and crosses to ... nobody in particular. But the hosts will be happy at having made progress down both flanks already. We have kick-off! The hosts get the party started, and stroke it around the back for a bit. Then suddenly Elmohamady sprints down the right and crosses ... to nobody in particular. South Africa come straight back at Egypt, Lorch sending a strange floater in from the left that\u2019s an easy claim for El Shenawy. A bright start! The teams are out! Both anthems performed and thoroughly respected. Egypt\u2019s bumps along at a fair old pace, and one of the players is a good few semitones out of key, but he\u2019s belting it out with great passion so fair enough. South Africa\u2019s epic is only a few minutes shorter than the Ring Cycle. Egypt sport red shirts and white shorts. South Africa wear yellow shirts and green shorts. We\u2019ll be off in a minute! A magnificent atmosphere under the lights at the Cairo International Stadium. It looks like a near-capacity 75,000 crowd, and they\u2019re all giving it plenty. The home fans are busy honouring their favourites ... ... but Bafana Bafana have some spirited backing too. Egypt won all three of their Group A matches. A goal from right-winger Trezeguet decided their opening match against Zimbabwe. After that, they registered two identical victories against DR Congo and Uganda: both matches ended 2-0 with goals from Mohamed Salah and captain Ahmed El Mohamady. South Africa have coughed and spluttered. Two 1-0 losses, to the Ivory Coast and Morocco, bookmarked a 1-0 win over Namibia. Bongani Zungu is their only goalscorer in the tournament so far. It was enough to scrape into the knockout stage as the fourth-best third-placed finishers. This is only the third time Egypt and South Africa have met in the Africa Cup of Nations. On both previous occasions, the Pharaohs have beaten Bafana Bafana, 1-0 in the groups in 1996, 2-0 in the 1998 final. OK, it\u2019s a small sample size, but given that South Africa went on to lift the cup in 1996, whoever wins today will be thinking history is very much on their side going forwards. The winner of this match will meet Nigeria in the quarters. Egypt: Mohamed El-Shenawy, Ashraf, Ahmed El Mohamady, Hegazy, Alaa, Hamed, Elneny, El Said, Salah, Mohsen, Trezeguet. Subs: Razek El-Shenawy, Morsy El Mohamady, Gaber, Ghazal, Said, Mansour, Kamel, Hamdi, Emad, Warda. South Africa: Williams, Hlanti, Mkhwanazi, Hlatshwayo, Mkhize, Furman, Zungu, Mokotjo, Lorch, Mothiba, Tau. Subs: Keet, Maela, Cardoso, Mphahlele, Maboe, Serero, Mabunda, Bvuma, Vilakazi, Kekana, Veldwijk. Referee: Eric Otogo-Castane (Gabon). Can hosts Egypt make it to the quarter-finals of the Africa Cup of Nations? Recent form points to yes. They won all three of their group games, and while the performances have yet to wow their fans, at least they\u2019re getting the job done. By comparison, South Africa only scraped into the last 16 as the fourth and final best third-placed finishers from the groups. They scored a grand total of one goal in doing so. South Africa manager Stuart Baxter is on record saying it\u2019d be a \u201cnational disaster\u201d for Egypt should they fail to win this one, and you can see his point. But this is football, so, y\u2019know. And there\u2019s a chance Mohamed Salah could be out, having sat out training yesterday with a heavy cold. Can the 1996 champs cause a huge upset and turf the seven-time winners out of their own party? We\u2019ll find out soon enough. It\u2019s on! Kick-off in Cairo: 8pm BST, 9pm local.",

Eight years ago in New Zealand England\u2019s campaign was mired in dwarf-throwing and ferry-dipping controversy but this time Jones is adopting a relaxed attitude towards his players and has urged them to enjoy their surroundings.

      "body": "<div id=\"block-5d2112ff8f08cf92bb76abbd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-06T21:32:34.950Z\">10.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Paul MacInnes's report of Evans' dramatic exit</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As a wail of discontent went around Court No 1, Dan Evans did his best to cover his eyes. The winner that had been there for the taking, the one that would have taken another game in this tense marathon to deuce, had flopped into the net. Evans, the last Briton in the men\u2019s draw, was going home.</p> \n  <p>Neither of these players had ever gone beyond the third round at Wimbledon before. That privilege, and a daunting encounter with third seed Rafael Nadal tomorrow, will now go to Jo\u00e3o Sousa. Sousa is the first Portuguese player in history to reach the second week of Wimbledon and on balance he deserved this narrow victory 4-6, 6-4, 7-5, 4-6, 6-4. But yes, it was close, the margins as fine as one mis-hit shot.</p> \n  <p>Evans started the match in barnstorming form. The British No 3 looking to rebuild his career at 29 after a year out of the game, had looked handy enough in getting past Federico Delbonis and Nikoloz Basilashvili in straight sets to reach this point. He carried on as he left off, breaking Sousa in the opening game and subduing him with energy and some superb stroke play. One backhand that was played like a drop shot but flew over Sousa\u2019s head as a lob, was a thrill in and of itself. He looked very much on top.</p> \n  <p>After breaking early in the second set the wind seemed set fair behind Evans. But out of nowhere, his mouth started to run, arguments with the umpire, others and perhaps himself. There was bad language and ultimately a warning. Amid all this Sousa broke back, and then did so again with the score at 5-4 to the Portuguese. Game back on.</p> \n  <p>In the third set it looked entirely as if the tables had turned. Sousa\u2019s powerful forehand, which had been so effectively neutered early on, was now dictating proceedings. Evans looked to have less power than his opponent, but was maybe also fatigued, getting caught on the back foot, letting shots drift. Still he nearly closed out the set after breaking early, but at 4-5 Sousa pounced and went 2-1 ahead.</p> \n  <p>After having given so much already, an Evans comeback was not guaranteed. But it did arrive, the Solihull native claiming an epic 10 minute game to take the third and decisive break in the set. The crowd was up for it and, after a break to close over the roof, Evans looked refreshed. He broke Sousa again at 1-1, but the Portuguese hit back instantly. The set then ran according to serve until it effectively became a tie-break. Evans once again began to snip and it was clear the energy was running low again. Sousa stayed calm, leaned on his forehand and had the last laugh.</p> \n  <p>Earlier in the day on Centre Court there was also defeat for another Briton, Heather Dart. This loss was more comprehensive however, a 6-1 6-1 shellacking at the hands of No 1 seed Ashleigh Barty. There was little in the way of a contest between the two players, Dart lacking anything of the power necessary to impose herself on the Australian. There were cheers at least when she held her serve, but the match was over in 53 minutes.</p> \n  <p>Afterwards Dart, who had never made it beyond the first round of the singles at Wimbledon before, said: \u201cI\u2019m super happy with my performances this week. I think today is such a good learning curve for me. She played great. She didn\u2019t let me in the match at all.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s obviously a tough lesson to learn. Again, it\u2019s been a great tournament for me. I should take a lot of positives from it.\u201d </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-06T22:41:01.103Z\">at 11.41pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d2100508f08cf92bb76ab50\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-06T20:11:14.432Z\">9.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>That\u2019s all from me today</strong>.

Then he comes up with a sliced backhand winner on the run, as you do. Yet two errors let Sousa climb to 30-all - and he has a match point after running down a backhand and sending a splendid winner down the line. This could be it. Evans bangs a missile down the line. Sousa somehow chops it just over the net. Evans hurtles forward and looks to have made it - only to dink a drop shot into the net! Oh no! What a miss! That is gutwrenching. Evans, overwhelmed by disappointment, wastes no time stomping off Court 1 at the end of a match he\u2019s thrown away. He was a break up in every set and fluffed his lines in sets two, three and five. Take nothing away from Sousa, though. He refused to give up and becomes the first Portuguese player to reach the fourth round. He faces Rafael Nadal next. Just what you want after a four-hour battle. As for Evans, his defeat means there are no British men left in the singles.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31f1c44d23e43b0cddf763be35a1d641e2c20e3b\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31f1c44d23e43b0cddf763be35a1d641e2c20e3b/0_0_3130_2087/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dan Evans reacts at the net after losing to Joao Sousa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dan Evans reacts at the net after losing to Joao Sousa.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d0a850a1930fe38aaa2af0be28fc694173e2bd1f\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0a850a1930fe38aaa2af0be28fc694173e2bd1f/0_0_1986_1437/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joao Sousa celebrates beating Dan Evans.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"724\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Whilst Sousa celebrates his victory.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-06T20:26:37.721Z\">at 9.26pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d20fe128f08d0b6ca52b6f8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-06T20:03:11.945Z\">9.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>You feel Evans has enough chances to get into the game, but too many mistakes allow Sousa a love hold and a 5-4 lead.</strong> We have approached the Business End of the match.

For a start we have the grandees of the sport, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams, all in singles action. While Williams has a rerun of last year\u2019s semi-final when she faces Julia Goerges in the first match on Court 1, Nadal will hope not to suffer any after-effects from his weird evening with Nick Kyrgios when he faces the experienced Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and when that\u2019s done Federer gets to have a go at another Frenchman, Lucas Pouille, the 27th seed.</p> \n  <p>But that\u2019s not all! Because what a day it is to be British! Harriet Dart, snubbed in the mixed doubles by the treacherous Jay Clarke, is through to the third round for the first time and plays Ashleigh Barty, the world No 1, in the first match on Centre. Then there\u2019s Johanna Konta, moving along without much fanfare, in an intriguing tussle with the USA\u2019s Sloane Stephens, the ninth seed and former US Open champion, in the second match on Court 1, where the singles action finishes with the resurgent Dan Evans taking on Portugal\u2019s Joao Sousa, who\u2019ll be riding high after his thumping second-round win over Marin Cilic.</p> \n  <p>And that\u2019s still not all! Because Andy Murray is playing not one but two doubles matches after his adventure with Serena had to be postponed because of the Gauff show last night. First Sir Muzz plays alongside \n   <strike>\n     Some Other Bloke \n   </strike> Pierre-Hugues Herbert in the second round of the men\u2019s doubles - they face Franko Skugor and Nikola Metic \u2013 and then he gets down to business with Serena in a match that still needs a court and won\u2019t start before 5.30pm. They play Andreas Mies and Alexa Guarachi.</p> \n  <p><strong>Play begins at:</strong> 11am BST.</p> \n </div> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "As a wail of discontent went around Court No 1, Dan Evans did his best to cover his eyes. The winner that had been there for the taking, the one that would have taken another game in this tense marathon to deuce, had flopped into the net. Evans, the last Briton in the men\u2019s draw, was going home. Neither of these players had ever gone beyond the third round at Wimbledon before. That privilege, and a daunting encounter with third seed Rafael Nadal tomorrow, will now go to Jo\u00e3o Sousa. Sousa is the first Portuguese player in history to reach the second week of Wimbledon and on balance he deserved this narrow victory 4-6, 6-4, 7-5, 4-6, 6-4. But yes, it was close, the margins as fine as one mis-hit shot. Evans started the match in barnstorming form. The British No 3 looking to rebuild his career at 29 after a year out of the game, had looked handy enough in getting past Federico Delbonis and Nikoloz Basilashvili in straight sets to reach this point. He carried on as he left off, breaking Sousa in the opening game and subduing him with energy and some superb stroke play. One backhand that was played like a drop shot but flew over Sousa\u2019s head as a lob, was a thrill in and of itself. He looked very much on top. After breaking early in the second set the wind seemed set fair behind Evans. But out of nowhere, his mouth started to run, arguments with the umpire, others and perhaps himself. There was bad language and ultimately a warning. Amid all this Sousa broke back, and then did so again with the score at 5-4 to the Portuguese. Game back on. In the third set it looked entirely as if the tables had turned. Sousa\u2019s powerful forehand, which had been so effectively neutered early on, was now dictating proceedings. Evans looked to have less power than his opponent, but was maybe also fatigued, getting caught on the back foot, letting shots drift. Still he nearly closed out the set after breaking early, but at 4-5 Sousa pounced and went 2-1 ahead. After having given so much already, an Evans comeback was not guaranteed. But it did arrive, the Solihull native claiming an epic 10 minute game to take the third and decisive break in the set. The crowd was up for it and, after a break to close over the roof, Evans looked refreshed. He broke Sousa again at 1-1, but the Portuguese hit back instantly. The set then ran according to serve until it effectively became a tie-break. Evans once again began to snip and it was clear the energy was running low again. Sousa stayed calm, leaned on his forehand and had the last laugh. Earlier in the day on Centre Court there was also defeat for another Briton, Heather Dart. This loss was more comprehensive however, a 6-1 6-1 shellacking at the hands of No 1 seed Ashleigh Barty. There was little in the way of a contest between the two players, Dart lacking anything of the power necessary to impose herself on the Australian. There were cheers at least when she held her serve, but the match was over in 53 minutes. Afterwards Dart, who had never made it beyond the first round of the singles at Wimbledon before, said: \u201cI\u2019m super happy with my performances this week. I think today is such a good learning curve for me. She played great. She didn\u2019t let me in the match at all. \u201cI think it\u2019s obviously a tough lesson to learn. Again, it\u2019s been a great tournament for me. I should take a lot of positives from it.\u201d That\u2019s all from me today. It\u2019s been eventful. Thanks for reading. See you again on Monday. Dan Evans begins with a beauty of a backhand down the line for 15-0. Then he comes up with a sliced backhand winner on the run, as you do. Yet two errors let Sousa climb to 30-all - and he has a match point after running down a backhand and sending a splendid winner down the line. This could be it. Evans bangs a missile down the line. Sousa somehow chops it just over the net. Evans hurtles forward and looks to have made it - only to dink a drop shot into the net! Oh no! What a miss! That is gutwrenching. Evans, overwhelmed by disappointment, wastes no time stomping off Court 1 at the end of a match he\u2019s thrown away. He was a break up in every set and fluffed his lines in sets two, three and five. Take nothing away from Sousa, though. He refused to give up and becomes the first Portuguese player to reach the fourth round. He faces Rafael Nadal next. Just what you want after a four-hour battle. As for Evans, his defeat means there are no British men left in the singles. You feel Evans has enough chances to get into the game, but too many mistakes allow Sousa a love hold and a 5-4 lead. We have approached the Business End of the match. Evans is now serving to stay in it. Evans is really annoyed with himself. He\u2019s swearing at himself. Then he apologies. \u201cBrainless,\u201d he bellows. Then he swears again. He needs to get it together. This is a test of mentality. Joao Sousa nets a forehand and Dan Evans holds to 30. It\u2019s 4-4. It\u2019s tight. I\u2019m predicting 12-all and a tie-break. A break point for Dan Evans; but Joao Sousa snuffs it out with a smash. Sousa holds. Another chance goes begging. Sousa leads 4-3. Dan Evans holds to 15. Three-all - and your guess is as good as mine. Dan Evans lies on the grass, smiling after a diving forehand drops just long at the end of another wondrous rally. This is such a good match. 15-all. Both players are playing some outstanding shots. The game goes to 30-all. Yet Sousa holds to 30 and leads 3-2 in the final set. Dan Evans despairingly put his hand over his face after failing to do enough with a forehand at 15-all, allowing Joao Sousa to win the point at the net. But he responds with a gorgeous, audacious, sliced backhand drop shot for 30-all. You never know what\u2019s going to happen next, though. Even Evans doesn\u2019t seem to know. As it turns out it\u2019s a double-fault that hands Sousa a break point. And Evans goofs a dreadful slice, the crowd howling as the ball dribbles into the net. There goes the break. Again. Sousa breaks back for 2-2 in the fifth set. Dan Evans breaks on Court 1! The British No 3 pounds his forehand and Joao Sousa has no answer. Evans leads 6-4, 4-6, 5-7, 6-4, 2-1. Andy Murray speaks. \u201cI lost in the doubles earlier so all the energy is focused on the mixed. It\u2019s a good start. I thought we returned well and served well.\u201d Serena Williams is asked who\u2019s the boss on Team Murrena. \u201cWe\u2019re a team,\u201d she grins. \u201cThere\u2019s no \u2018I\u2019 in team.\u201d Murray adds: \u201cWe\u2019re both the younger sibling so we\u2019re used to being bossed. We\u2019re taking it in turns.\u201d Murray finishes by saying that his hip is holding up after two matches in one day, while Williams is happy with the state of her knee. Dan Evans responds with a comfortable hold for 1-1. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Dan!\u201d the home fans cry. Back to Court 1. Joao Sousa holds in the first game of the fifth set. It\u2019s nip and tuck out there. Sousa\u2019s a feisty competitor. You won\u2019t see a lack of effort from him. Two match points are saved. A smash from Murray brings up a third. Guarachi\u2019s race is run. A weak second serve is meat and drink for Murray, who stifles a yawn before plonking a forehand return the line. He shares a hug with Williams. They\u2019re into the second round thanks to an easy win and everyone\u2019s had a very good time, even the losing pair. The fifth set on Court 1 begins with Joao Sousa serving. It\u2019s a very partisan and pumped up crowd now. Dan Evans will fancy his chances here. A hold for Andy Murray, a 6-4, 5-1 lead for him and Williams. The action on Centre Court is almost over. The roof is shut on Court 1. Dan Evans and Joao Sousa will begin their fifth set soon. Serena Williams saves three break points and holds over on Centre Court. It\u2019s a 6-4, 4-0 lead for Wimbledon\u2019s new dynamic duo. Serving for the fourth set, Dan Evans hits his heads with his racquet after a mistake makes it 30-15. Think, he\u2019s saying to himself. Luckily Sousa isn\u2019t think too clearly either. He misses a forehand and Evans has two set points. Sousa goes on the attack. Evans hangs in there with Murray-esque defence - I didn\u2019t know he had it in him - and when his chance arrives he takes it with a superb forehand pass! What a shot! What a match. Evans wins the fourth set 6-4 and they\u2019re going into a decider. First, though, it seems they\u2019ll be shutting the roof. The skies are darkening over SW19. On Centre Court Murrena/SerAndy lead by a set and a break against Guarachi and Mies. They should have linked up years ago. Years ago! Think of all the fun they could have had. Serving at 4-4 in the fourth set, Joao Sousa brilliantly saves three break points. But Dan Evans is proving hard to shake off. He earns a fourth - and takes it when a vicious slice forces Sousa to net a forehand. Evans breaks for 5-4 and will serve for a fifth set. Murrena take the first set 6-4. It\u2019s all going very well! Dan Evans holds for 4-4 in the fourth set. It could yet go either way. Dan Evans lets another break slip away. Joao Sousa breaks back for 3-3 in the fourth set. On Centre Court Alexa Guarachi\u2019s serve is being pulled apart by Andy Murray and Serena Williams. But she does manage to save a break point and force deuce. Luckily Andreas Mies is volleying well. So\u2019s Murray, though. Delightful play at the net earns a second break point. Surprisingly, though, Murray misses a forehand return off a second serve. He hangs his head - and well he might. But he makes up for it with a vicious backhand that brings up another break point. Incredibly, though, Murray nets an easy forehand down the line. Eventually Guarachi holds. Murray and Williams lead 4-3. Just the one break. Dan Evans receives a warning for an audible obscenity. He chunters away at the umpire in response. The spirit of Nick Kyrgios lives on. Still, he holds to 15. Joao Sousa leads 4-6, 6-4, 7-5, 0-2. They\u2019re cheering on Court 1, urging Dan Evans on. He breaks in the first game of the fourth set when Joao Sousa nets a tame forehand. This might yet go to five sets. Meanwhile Murrena/SerAndy are skipping merrily along against Mies and Guarachi. They lead 3-1 on Centre Court, where everyone\u2019s having lots of fun. Serving to stay in the third set, it\u2019s jittery for Dan Evans when he knocks a forehand long for 15-30. Joao Sousa makes him run and Evans sends a forehand long. Two set points for Sousa. The Portuguese misses a forehand on the first. 30-40. But he turns up the heat on the second, spanking a backhand, and Evans can only send a slice long. Sousa leads 4-6, 4-6, 5-7. Evans has thrown the last two sets away. He\u2019s off for a comfort break. Joao Sousa holds to love and leads 6-5 in the third set. Dan Evans will serve to force a tie-break. The Murrena partnership is going well. They\u2019ve broken immediately. Serving for the third set, Dan Evans quickly finds himself trailing 15-30. Then a piercing return from Joao Sousa is too good for Evans\u2019s attempt to serve and volley. It\u2019s 15-40. The tension goes up a notch. But Sousa stays cool and belts a forehand down the line to make it 5-5. Joao Sousa holds. Dan Evans will serve to lead by two sets to one. Dan Evans comes through another tricky service game and holds for 6-4, 4-6, 5-3 on Court 1. Joao Sousa will serve to keep the third set alive. It\u2019s very exciting over there. Serena Williams spoke about her partnership with Andy Murray after beating Julia Goerges earlier. Andy and I both love the competition. I know we both want to do well. We\u2019re not here just for show. We want to play well. We both have been champions at Wimbledon. It\u2019s like we want to continue to do that. I always play the forehand side. If you want to play with me, I play forehand. It\u2019s just the only rule I have. I feel like I always play doubles, and the doubles really is able to help my singles game. That\u2019s super, super important for me. We don\u2019t feel pressure. Like I said, we really want to win. We\u2019ll see what happens. We know what it\u2019s like to win. We also know what it\u2019s like not to win. Obviously we want to do our best to get there.\u201d Andy Murray and Serena Williams - must we call them Murrena - are grinning before their entrance on Centre Court. Murray lost his men\u2019s doubles match earlier, but he looks happy enough as he chats away to Williams. Oh, there are two other players taking part here. Andreas Mies, a 28-year-old German, and Alexa Guarachi, a 28-year-old Chilean. The roar from the crowd is huge as they emerge. This should be fun. Inspired by my Tim Henman stat, Dan Evans breaks to love to lead Joao Sousa 6-4, 4-6, 4-3. They\u2019re loving him on Court 1. And so with the scheduled matches on Centre Court wrapped up, it is no doubt with a heavy heart that All England Club officials move Andy Murray and Serena Williams versus Andreas Mies and Alexa Guarachi there. Over on Court 1, meanwhile, Dan Evans has heard my Tim Henman stat and reacted by losing his serve. Joao Sousa breaks back in the sixth game of the third set. Rafa Nadal might not be terrified if he\u2019s watching this. The punters on Centre Court are happy. Another stroll for the No 2 seed, whose next victim opponent is Matteo Berrettini on Monday. Pouille gave it his best shot and had a small chance of winning the first set but there was never any genuine sense he could win this one. If Dan Evans wins he will be the first British man outside of Andy Murray in the fourth round here since Tim Henman in 2004. What a glorious tennis nation! Lucas Pouille saves a match point and holds for 6-6. Roger Federer will need to win a tie-break to wrap it up in straight sets. \u201cCome on!\u201d Dan Evans yelps after converting a second break point to lead Joao Sousa 6-4, 4-6, 2-1. \u201cUse your brain,\u201d he adds. He\u2019s pumped up today. After all the winner faces Rafa Nadal. Roger Federer holds to 15 and leads 7-5, 6-2, 6-5. Lucas Pouille\u2019s best hope is a tie-break now. Matteo Berrettini has beaten Diego Schwartzman 6-7, 7-6, 4-6, 7-6, 6-3. The 17th seed awaits Roger Federer or Lucas Pouille in the fourth round. Pouille has held for 5-5 in the third set. In a rather less dramatic affair on Centre Court - for now, anyway \u2013 Roger Federer leads 7-5, 6-2, 5-4 against Lucas Pouille, who\u2019s serving to stay in it. It\u2019s been a big old snooze on Centre Court today. The failure to secure the double break has come back to haunt Dan Evans, with Joao Sousa holding for 5-4 and immediately turning the screw as the British No 3 serves to stay in this see-sawing second set. Sousa is two points from levelling it after smashing for 0-30. Sousa is playing some superb tennis and he races to net to put a volley away for three set points. Evans saves the first with a granite volley for 15-40, drawing anxious cheers from the crowd. Then he polishes off a point at the net for 30-40. Attacking tennis pays off and Evans seizes the initiative on the next forward, charging forward to force deuce with a volley. He\u2019s found some grit here. But then, when Sousa forces another set point, Evans loses his focus. A double-fault hands Sousa the second set. Evans is livid as he returns to his chair. He\u2019s chuntering away about something or other. They\u2019re in a fifth set in a rather overlooked match on Court 17. Matteo Berrettini, the 17th seed, is 4-2 up in that decider against the diminutive Diego Schwartzman. Joao Sousa is really starting to give it some. He earns his first break point, but can\u2019t take it, netting a forehand. But he has another quickly enough and finally breaks when Evans nets a backhand. \u201cFucking shit,\u201d Evans moans. Evans leads 6-4, 4-4 and he\u2019s under some pressure now. Evans forces more break points from Sousa, but didn\u2019t manage to convert it. Sousa has saved 10 break points, while Evans has saved none. More demonstrative stuff from the Portuguese but all he has done is stopped himself being broken. Evans is not as comfortable as he might like in the second set. Pouille is not playing too badly, and has shown off a decent array of shots. Federer looks a little weary, perhaps, and has been sent round the court rather more than he might like. It\u2019s going with serve in the third set, at 2-2, \u201cLet\u2019s go, Roger, let\u2019s go,\u201d sings some Pimm\u2019s-ed up poltroon in the Centre Court cheap seat. Chanting never really did take off at SW19. Sousa is doing a lot of shouting. Is it helping? A little. He did play one sumptuous winner to stop a break point to go 1-4 down in the second but then concedes another break point. Evans makes a mess of that one, then undercooks a backhand. Sousa saves himself from going a double break down. Federer\u2019s wobble did not last long and he wins two set points on Pouille\u2019s serve. And takes the second with a whipped, top-spin forehand that Pouille cannot dig out. Nice and easy. He wins the second set 6-2. Evans breaks an angry Sousa, who is calling upon the heavens, and goes 2-1 up in the second set. A Tim Henman-style fist pump in the direction of his coaches denotes his satisfaction. Federer was serving to go 5-0 up in the second set under the watchful eye of Amelie Mauresmo but is broken by Pouille. Drama, of sorts. Evans wins the first set 6-4! Dan Evans serve for the first set, and charges into a 30-0 lead. Just as it looks as if Sousa is set to level it at 30-30, Evans whistles a backhand winner past his opponent. And then, with a skidding serve, forces Sousa into an error. How does he celebrate? By reaching for the paracetamol. I\u2019m going to take a quick break and hand over to John Brewin for a bit. Be nice. Jay Clarke and Cori Gauff are out of the mixed doubles. They\u2019ve lost 6-1, 6-4 to Jelena Ostapenko and Robert Lindtstedt, who finishes it with a killer forehand return. Oh Jay. A penny for Harriet Dart\u2019s thoughts. Roger Federer picks a good moment to turn on the style. Lucas Pouille picks a bad moment to doze off. Pressure from Federer unsettles the Frenchman, who\u2019s facing two set points after a double-fault. He saves the first. He knocks a forehand wide on the second and Federer takes it 7-5. Dan Evans\u2019s still a break up against Joao Sousa. He leads 3-2. Sousa has started to offer more, though. Roger Federer finds himself in a spot of bother serving at 5-5. He has to smash to save a break point. Lucas Pouille\u2019s threatening here. But Federer gees himself up and holds to lead 6-5. Lucas Pouille is still holding his own against Roger Federer. It\u2019s 5-5 on Centre Court. Reports here. No sign of a break on Centre Court yet. It\u2019s 3-3 between Federer and Pouille. Dan Evans is going to win Wimbledon. Maybe. The British No 3 has made a cracking start on Court 1, breaking Joao Sousa in the first game with a truly excellent forehand. On Court 2 Cori Gauff and Jay Clarke have lost the first set of their mixed doubles 6-1 to Jelena Ostapenko and Robert Lindstedt. I wonder if Clarke will come to regret jumping on the Gauff bandwagon at the expense of poor old Harriet Dart. Gauff, who plays Simona Halep on Monday, must be a bit exhausted after her singles exertions. Should have stuck with Dart, Jay. Not to disrespect Lucas Pouille, a flamboyant and enjoyable player, but the men\u2019s draw could really do with Roger Federer winning here. State of the fourth round at the moment. When are the so-called Next Gen stars going to step up? Roger Federer and Lucas Pouille are going through their final preparations on Centre Court. Federer leads their head-to-head 1-0. Play will resume in the match on Court 12 at 5pm. It was suspended because a spectator required emergency medical treatment. An ambulance has since entered the grounds. Konta looked lost midway through the second set. Defeat looked inevitable. She was swearing at herself and remonstrating with her box. She could barely do anything right. Somehow, though, she hung in there and her resilience allowed her to turn the match on its head. And here we are with her serving for the match against the ninth seed and former US Open champion. She moves into a 30-0 lead. An ace makes it 40-15, at which point Stephens, who lost the plot long ago, sends a forehand long. \u201cCome on!\u201d a beaming Konta cries after securing a monumental win that takes her into a fourth-round meeting with Petra Kvitova, the sixth seed and two-time Wimbledon champion. It\u2019s brilliant from Johanna Konta! She pounds her forehands to get Sloane Stephens on the run. She brings the American forward with a volley. Stephens, always quick off the mark, scampers forward and flicks a forehand from right to left - but Konta knows what she\u2019s up to and is there with a volley that brings her a break and a 3-6, 6-4, 5-1 lead! What a turnaround on Court 1! A few years ago this would have been a good match. Not now, though. Tsonga, 34 years old, is the world No 79 for a reason. He was no match for Nadal, who reaches the fourth round with an ace out wide. That was thoroughly uneventful. Nadal plays Dan Evans or Joao Sousa next. On Court 12 play has been suspended in the match between Jan-Lennard Struff and Mikael Kukushkin, who leads 6-3, 7-6, 4-6, 2-2, due to a spectator requiring medical attention. The crowd have left their seats. Andy Murray\u2019s dream of doubles glory dies in the second round, two solid Croatians refusing to play by the script. Over to the mixed doubles and Serena Williams, then. Maybe this doubles lark isn\u2019t that easy. And just like that Johanna Konta breaks to lead 3-6, 6-4, 2-0 on Court 1. Maybe that burst of anger midway through the second set has woken her up. It could be a turning point in her career. Johanna Konta seemed to be sinking midway through the second set, but she grew stronger as it wore on and pounced in the ninth game, lashing a forehand past Sloane Stephens to level it up on Court 1. On Court 2, meanwhile, Andy Murray and Pierre-Hugues Herbert are sinking towards a four-set defeat against Franko Skugor and Nikola Metic. Fabio Fognini\u2019s in his interview now. His fingers are on his right hand are bloody after he decided it would be a good idea to punch his racquet during his defeat to Tennys Sandgren. There\u2019s extra interest here because Fognini, unhappy to be put on Court 14, was caught saying \u201ca bomb should explode here\u201d. He laughs when he\u2019s asked about it all. \u201cThe court was not really good. Most of the time when you are on court you are frustrated. I was not happy with my performance. It was a good chance to win. If I offended someone I say sorry. No problem.\u201d He goes on to brush aside questions from the English media about his conduct during his defeat to Tennys Sandgren. Interestingly the combustible Italian was fined a provisional $94,000 and banned for two grand slams after verbally abusing an umpire at the US Open in 2017 - however the ban only applied if he committed a \u201cmajor offence\u201d in the next two years. Rafael Nadal breaks to love to lead Tsonga 6-2, 6-3, 2-1 on Centre Court. The punters there aren\u2019t getting much value for money today. Most unexciting. Jo Konta allows a break point to slip from her grasp and Sloane Stephens holds to lead 6-3, 4-4. Konta still looks out of sorts. It could all be on the mixed doubles for Andy Murray soon. Franko Skugor and Nikola Metric have taken the third set on Court 2, giving them a 6-7, 6-4, 6-2 lead over Murray and Herbert. Rafa Nadal leads 6-2, 6-3 against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. As it happens this is their first meeting since Shanghai in 2015. Tsonga won that one. The last time there were only four of the top 10 in the men\u2019s fourth round here was 2008. They were Richard Gasquet, Marcos Baghdatis and a couple of chaps called Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. And Gasquet would lose from two sets up to a bicep-flexing Andy Murray, Baghdatis lost 8-6 in the final set to Feliciano Lopez, and Federer and Nadal went on to play their classic final. A huge hold for Johanna Konta. She saves three break points and finds enough resolve to keep Sloane Stephens at bay. Stephens leads 6-3, 2-3 and will serve. This is a surprising sight. It\u2019s not often you see Johanna Konta show her emotional side on court. But she isn\u2019t happy with how she\u2019s playing at the moment and at one point she bellows at her box, gestures unhappily and appears to let out an expletive. Jo! I didn\u2019t know you had it in you. Still, perhaps letting it all hang loose is what the British No 1, down a set and desperately trying to hang in there against Sloane Stephens, needs... It really wasn\u2019t Fabio Fognini\u2019s day. The Italian also needed a medical timeout after punching his own racquet. Andy Murray\u2019s just dropped his serve. The Croatian pair of Franko Skugor and Nikola Metic lead 6-7, 6-4, 3-1 on Court 2. It\u2019s not going to plan. Fabio Fognini appears to have come out with an outrageous comment during his defeat to Tennys Sandgren. The Italian is due to speak to the media at 3.55pm. I note that Tennys Sandgren has beaten Fabio Fognini, the 12th seed, in straight sets. The men\u2019s seeds have been awful this year. The only ones left from the top 10 are Federer, Nadal, Djokovic and Nishikori, who\u2019s seeded eighth. And below that it\u2019s not much better. When I get a moment I\u2019m going to have a proper look at the stats, but it doesn\u2019t make for encouraging reading as far as the state of the game goes. Eveyone spoke about how hard Rafa Nadal\u2019s draw was at the start of the tournament. I was never sold on that, though. His path to the semis looks kind to me. The Spaniard\u2019s looking rampant against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who isn\u2019t the force of old, and has won the first set 6-2. Thanks Alex. And as I return Andy Murray and Pierre-Hugues Herbert lose the second set of their doubles match to Franko Skugor and Nikola Metic. The Croatian pair level the match after taking it 6-4. Another Murray epic on the way, then. And with that, here\u2019s Jacob. It\u2019s been a pleasure. First blood to Sloane Stephens, who\u2019s made to work for it by Konta until the Briton slices into the net at 40-30. She\u2019ll need three sets if she\u2019s to win a game that\u2019s shaping up very nicely indeed. \u2026and she only needs one. Konta lashes wildly wide to go 5-3 down and Stephens, who\u2019s coming into this game with real purpose, will serve for the set. Nadal breaks Tsonga and holds to go 4-1 up in the first, celebrating with little more than a neurotic twitch of the lips. Tsonga squints, apprehensive, and retires to the sideline for a snack. Two break points for Stephens on No 1 Court. Barbora Strycova has gone from Bertens to Mertens, with a straight sets win (7-5, 6-1) win over Kiki Bertens booking her place in the fourth round, where Elise Mertens awaits. No breaks yet in the second set of the Murray/Herbert doubles, which is at 2-2. Konta v Stephens is already shaping up nicely, with a couple of rallies exchanged, both looking grimly focused and the American holding her serve to love for 3-2. On Centre Court, Rafa Nadal batters his way through his second service game, bronzed quadriceps bulging ominously. And here\u2019s our report from Ashleigh Barty\u2019s win against Harriet Dart: Konta sends a double-handed return wide, and that\u2019s the first game to Stephens. But the Briton responds with vigour, dropping just one point in her first service game, her serving already looking laser-guided. 1-1. And we\u2019re under way on Centre Court, where Rafael Nadal makes short work of the opening game. A long afternoon lies ahead for Wilfried Tsonga. Afternoon all. And as Stephens and Konta limber up on Centre Court, the Skurgor/Metic pairing hold their serve in the first game of the second set despite a scything forehand down the line from Murray to bring it back to 40-30. And the nominally-determined Tennys Sandgren has gone two sets to the good against Fabio Fognini, 14-12 on the tie-break. And with that I\u2019m going to find some lunch and leave you in the capable hands of Alex Hess. Johanna Konta and Sloane Stephens have arrived on Court 1 and Rafael Nadal and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga are out on Centre Court. A stunning, vintage backhand return from Andy Murray helps him and Pierre-Hugues Herbert take control of a first-set tie-break against Franko Skurgor and Nikola Metic. Before long they have three set points. They can\u2019t take the first, but they take the second, a firm Murray forehand doing the job. Much like when they met in the semi-finals last year, Williams has far too much firepower for her German opponent. The American sails through to the fourth round and a match against Carla Suarez Navarro, the 30th seed. I think that was her best performance of the week and it leaves her free to rest up for her mixed doubles match with Andy Murray later today. Ashleigh Barty\u2019s 53-minute win over was Harriet Dart was the second quickest women\u2019s match this week. Elise Mertens only needed 48 minutes to beat Fiona Farro 6-2, 6-0 in the first round (the second set lasted 19 minutes). Barty\u2019s in a hurry, though. Her last two matches have both lasted under than an hour. It\u2019s all over in 53 minutes. Dart sends a final backhand long and wide to confirm a simple victory for Barty, who was in no mood to let the young Brit get into the match at any point. Dart\u2019s Wimbledon adventure is over and Barty goes through to face Alison Riske on Monday. All of a sudden Harriet Dart leaves 0-40 on Ashleigh Barty\u2019s serve. Three break points seem to offer her a way back into this one-sided match. But that\u2019s the cue for Barty to play some of her very best tennis, with a spinning backhand slice that faded away from an exasperated Dart for 15-40 a particular highlight. A few crunching forehands later, Barty leads 6-1, 5-1. Elise Mertens, the 21st seed, has knocked out China\u2019s Wang Qiang, the 15th seed. The Belgian triumphed 6-2, 6-7 (9), 6-4. On Court 1, meanwhile, aggressive tactics are working for Serena Williams, who breaks the struggling Julia Goerges for a 6-3, 3-2 lead. She\u2019s surely getting this done in straight sets, leaving her nice and rested for her mixed doubles match with Andy Murray later. It\u2019s relentless from Ashleigh Barty, who breaks yet again to lead Harriet Dart 6-1, 3-0. Meanwhile Andy Murray\u2019s serve is coming under pressure in his doubles match on Court 2. However he digs in to hold for 4-3 in the first set. The suffering goes on for Harriet Dart, who\u2019s down a break in the second set already. There\u2019s no stopping the brilliant Ashleigh Barty today. At least it wasn\u2019t a bagel. But it\u2019s still an ugly scoreline from Harriet Dart\u2019s perspective. She saves a set point with a lovely forehand pass down the line, but Ashleigh Barty responds with her fifth ace so far and takes the opener 6-1. It\u2019s looking grim for Harriet Dart, broken twice already by Ashleigh Barty, who leads 5-0 on Centre Court. Barty is all over the British pretender at the moment. It\u2019s a mauling. Oh dear. Serena Williams earns a set point with a swinging ace out wide. Then she nets a forehand. Deuce. She earns another one with a clever, lofted forehand. She wastes it with another poor forehand. A third chance arrives. She takes this one with an excellent forehand. Got there in the end. The first set\u2019s over. 6-3. It\u2019s not taken Ashleigh Barty to break through. With Harriet Dart understandably feeling the nerves on her Centre Court debut, the world No 1 breaks to lead 2-1. Serena Williams lands the first blow, a few thumping returns earning her a break for 4-2 on Court 1. Julia Goerges nets a forehand and drops her serve to 15. Williams is looking very strong indeed. Well that\u2019s a surprise. Belinda Bencic looked to be on her way to victory against Alison Riske, but the Swiss has found managed to throw it away. She was a break up in the third set, but the 13th seed has gone down 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 to the unseeded American, who goes through to face the winner of Barty-Darty. A comfortable early hold for Ashleigh Barty, sealed with an ace out wide. The Australian leads 1-0 against Harriet Dart. \u201cCome on Harriet!\u201d someone cries. Where to look, where to look? While Harriet Dart\u2019s about to get going against Ashleigh Barty on Centre Court, Andy Murray\u2019s arrived on Court 2 for his first doubles match of the day. He partners Pierre-Hugues Herbert against Croatian pair Franko Skugor and Nikola Metic. I spotted Fabio Fognini wandering around the grounds yesterday. The Italian is very handsome, he\u2019ll be pleased to hear. However is tennis isn\u2019t looking too hot today. The 12th seed has lost the first set of his third-round match to Tennys Sandgren, who took it 6-3. On Court 1 Julia Goerges saves a break point with an ace and manages to keep Serena Williams at bay in her opening service game, holding for 1-1. Meanwhile Ashleigh Barty and Harriet Dart y have arrived on Centre Court. It\u2019s a tall order for Dart against the French Open champion but she\u2019s come a long way since her drubbing by Maria Sharapova in the first round of the Australian Open in January. Can she pull off an unlikely shock? I say no, not a chance. But it\u2019s sport. Anything can happen. Kei Nishikori and Sam Querrey are both safely through to the fourth round. Nishikori made it five from five against Steve Johnson, while Querrey recovered from an early wobble to see off John Millman in three sets. It\u2019s worth keeping an eye on Querrey. He could play Rafael Nadal in the last eight and his big serve would be a threat. They\u2019re heading out on Centre Court and Court 1. Serena Williams and Julia Goerges are there too. On Centre Court the first match is Harriet Dart, the 22-year-old Londoner, against Ashleigh Barty, the world No 1. First, though, they\u2019re celebrating all the athletes in the Royal Box there. Eric Dier\u2019s the main draw, no doubt. Gareth Southgate\u2019s there too. Plenty of cricketers. Mo Farah. Carl Froch. Seb Coe. Rod Laver. Laura Davies. Chris Hoy. Billie Jean King. Anne Keothavong. So many legends. Belinda Bencic has been taken into a third set on Court 12. However the 13th seed leads 6-4, 4-6, 3-0. Kei Nishikori is speeding along to victory. He leads 6-4, 6-3 against Steve Johnson. There\u2019s better news for Americans on Court 17. Sam Querrey\u2019s using his big serve to good effect against John Millman. He leads 7-6, (3), 7-6 (8). Lauren Davis stunned Angelique Kerber in the previous round, but she\u2019s run out of gas against Carla Suarez Navarro. The 30th seed has won in straight sets and plays Serena Williams or Julia Goerges next. On match point Linette comes up with an absolute fluke, a mishit forehand return that hangs in the air somehow drops on the line with Kvitova stranded. Linette has the good grace to look embarrassed. But her reprieve is momentary. Kvitova has another match point and she takes this one when Linette sends a forehand return long. Kei Nishikori is motoring along on Court 3. He\u2019s up a set and a break now. Kei Nishikori might have a weak serve, but the boy can return. The eighth seed was down an early break to Steve Johnson, but he\u2019s just won the first set set 6-4 and looks good to maintain his 100% record against the honest but limited American. Sam Querrey, who thumped world No 4 Dominic Thiem in the first round, has recovered from a clunky start to win a first-set tie-break against John Millman on Court 17. It was more straightforward for Elise Mertens, the 21st seed, on Court 18. The Belgian won the first set 6-2 against China\u2019s Wang Qiang, the 15th seed. And Belinda Bencic is proving a touch too skilled for Alison Riske, who\u2019s a set down against the promising Swiss, But Petra Kvitova doesn\u2019t have to wait long. She allows herself a little celebratory hop on the baseline as she watches Magda Linette send a return long; that\u2019s the first set in the bag. 6-3 Kvitova, who\u2019s looking fit and focused on Court 2. Solid serving helps Magda Linette save four set points and keep Petra Kvitova waiting. Linette holds and Kvitova will serve for the first set at 5-3. Over on Court 16, meanwhile, Carla Suarez Navarro is proving too good for Lauren Davis at the moment. The 30th seed has just won the first set 6-3 against the American lucky loser. Breaks come, breaks go, and Kei Nishikori has got it back on serve against Steve Johnson on Court 3. Johnson leads 3-2. Over on Court 12 Belinda Bencic, the 13th seed, is enjoying herself against the USA\u2019s Alison Riske. The Swiss leads 3-1. Meanwhile Petra Kvitova has just broken for a 3-1 lead against Magda Linette, while Carla Suarez Navarro, the 30th seed, has also started well against Lauren Davis, conqueror of defending champion Angelique Kerber. But breaks come and breaks go. Nothing can be taken for granted. Sam Querrey is back on level terms with John Millman on Court 17. A fine start for Steve Johnson on Court 3. That worrying head-to-head record isn\u2019t holding him back. The American has broke early to lead 2-0 against Kei Nishikroi. Things aren\u2019t going so well for another American, though. Sam Querrey, a semi-finalist in 2017, trails by a break in the first set against Australian scrapper John Millman on Court 17. The players have arrived on the outside courts. We\u2019ll have play soon. First up on Court 2, Petra Kvitova takes on Magda Linette. Kvita, the No 6 seed, has only played Linette once before and beat her in Montreal in 2016. Meanwhile Kei Nishikori is looking to extend his dominance over Steve Johnson on Court 3. Nishikori has won all four of his previous meetings with the unseeded American, who had a good five-set victory over Alex de Minaur in the second round. Eric Dier is in the Royal Box today. I suppose he does bear a passing resemblance to Prince Harry. Coco-mania has taken Wimbledon by storm. When I left the grounds last night the hill was packed and everyone was transfixed as they watched Gauff\u2019s win over Polona Hercog. I\u2019ve rarely seen it so busy for a third-round match. Hello. The sun\u2019s beating down on SW19, everyone\u2019s suffering from a Cori Gauff hangover (what a kid!) and we\u2019ve got another packed schedule ahead of us. For a start we have the grandees of the sport, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams, all in singles action. While Williams has a rerun of last year\u2019s semi-final when she faces Julia Goerges in the first match on Court 1, Nadal will hope not to suffer any after-effects from his weird evening with Nick Kyrgios when he faces the experienced Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and when that\u2019s done Federer gets to have a go at another Frenchman, Lucas Pouille, the 27th seed. But that\u2019s not all! Because what a day it is to be British! Harriet Dart, snubbed in the mixed doubles by the treacherous Jay Clarke, is through to the third round for the first time and plays Ashleigh Barty, the world No 1, in the first match on Centre. Then there\u2019s Johanna Konta, moving along without much fanfare, in an intriguing tussle with the USA\u2019s Sloane Stephens, the ninth seed and former US Open champion, in the second match on Court 1, where the singles action finishes with the resurgent Dan Evans taking on Portugal\u2019s Joao Sousa, who\u2019ll be riding high after his thumping second-round win over Marin Cilic. And that\u2019s still not all! Because Andy Murray is playing not one but two doubles matches after his adventure with Serena had to be postponed because of the Gauff show last night. First Sir Muzz plays alongside Some Other Bloke Pierre-Hugues Herbert in the second round of the men\u2019s doubles - they face Franko Skugor and Nikola Metic \u2013 and then he gets down to business with Serena in a match that still needs a court and won\u2019t start before 5.30pm. They play Andreas Mies and Alexa Guarachi. Play begins at: 11am BST.",

      "body": "<p>It wouldn\u2019t quite be fair to say that the US have been the best team for the entirety of this World Cup.

Homelessness charities must refuse complicity in the hostile environment.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the <a href=\"http://www.pilu.org.uk/defending-eea-homeless-rights/\" title=\"\">Public Interest Law Centre</a>, which won the high court case, said: \u201cIt\u2019s now clear the Home Office \u2013 with the Greater London Authority, local councils and some homelessness charities \u2013 is trying to resurrect this discriminatory policy under a different guise.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Home Office is trying to resurrect this discriminatory policy under a different guise</p> <footer> <cite>Public Interest Law Centre</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The correspondence reveals that some refugee charities have already been asked to forward cases to the programme, called the Rough Sleeper Support Service (RSSS), and at least one has agreed. Emails also reveal that homeless charity <a href=\"https://www.mungos.org/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI7bbxkK-g4wIVDLDtCh0FeQ-PEAAYASAAEgIKwvD_BwE\" title=\"\">St Mungo\u2019s </a>has attended meetings with the Home Office to discuss allowing outreach workers to enter a homeless person\u2019s data into RSSS without their consent.</p> <p>An email, dated 10 April 2019 from a Home Office official, confirmed the scheme \u201cprovides a single point of contact for LAs [local authorities] to receive rapid immigration status checks on non-UK national rough sleepers\u201d. It also explains why it wants to bypass privacy laws: \u201cA system relying on consent to comply with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/21/what-is-gdpr-and-how-will-it-affect-you\" title=\"\">GDPR</a> [EU General Data Protection Regulation] would be vulnerable to individuals withdrawing consent.\u201d</p> <p>Another email, dated 18 February 2019 to GLA officials, shows that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/aug/19/home-office-secret-emails-data-homeless-eu-nationals\" title=\"\">targeting homeless individuals</a> would be prompt, saying \u201cimmigration [status] checks are completed on rough sleepers within 24 hours of a referral\u201d.</p> <p>Obtained through freedom of information requests from Liberty, the correspondence says the scheme is spearheaded by the lead officer for previous immigration enforcement operations and will be \u201cutilised to resolve the non-EEA national rough sleepers situations\u201d. The emails also chronicle Home Office frustration that the programme is still in the test phase because of a failure to agree a data-sharing deal with charities and local authorities.</p> <p>The emails show significant opposition from charities with \u201cpush back\u201d from several including St Mungo\u2019s and migrants advocacy group Praxis, who warn of \u201creputational risks\u201d for groups linked to the scheme. According to one email, <a href=\"http://www.praxis.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Praxis </a>raised several concerns, including that the scheme risked \u201cpoorly made decisions\u201d, was unnecessary and that it was \u201cunclear if RSSS referral would make detaining and removal of rough sleepers at their reporting appointments more likely\u201d.</p> <p>The charity raises fears that the programme will be primarily geared at removing rough sleepers. \u201cThere appear to be no immigration decision-makers in the RSSS, just immigration officers. The culture embedded in the RSSS seems to be one of enforcement,\u201d it said in an email sent on 3 May 2016.</p> <p>Even as the scheme was conceived, fears existed that it would be controversial. One email, sent on 18 December 2018, from a GLA officer to the Home Office, cites a \u201cpossibility of bad press surrounding the RSSS and there needs to be a clear line on what this team is and how it can help ensure no one dies on the streets\u201d.</p> <p>Although some emails show that sharing information with the Home Office could help prioritise a person\u2019s case and ensure homelessness charities offered the right support, Bradley said referrals will likely result in immigration enforcement action.</p> <p>She said ministers should be concentrating on combating the root causes of homelessness rather than targeting rough sleepers. \u201cConsent and data protection should also be at the heart of our interactions with public institutions,\u201d she added.</p> <p>The Public Law Interest Centre spokesman added: \u201cDespite its name, the new RSSS offers no \u2018support\u2019 to homeless migrants living in the UK. It is an \u2018hostile environment\u2019 measure in all but name.\u201d</p> <p>A St Mungo\u2019s spokesperson said the charity had met Home Office staff \u201cto find ways to respond more quickly\u201d to non-UK cases. \u201cIn particular, we are seeking to ensure people who may use the service do so based on informed consent and legal advice from a registered immigration adviser,\u201d they added.</p> <p>A Home Office spokesman said the RSSS was set up \u201cto help resolve the immigration status of non-UK nationals sleeping rough, either granting lawful status or providing documentation. This enables individuals to access support or assists them in leaving the UK where appropriate.\u201d He added: \u201cThe service prioritises support work on outstanding cases and helps to resolve status issues.\u201d</p> <p>A London mayoral spokesperson said: \u201cHeavy-handed enforcement is not the solution to rough sleeping and our services will have no part in it. We have made absolutely clear to the Home Office that we do not support their approach or any other that victimises people sleeping rough.\u201d</p> <p>The latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/19/london-rough-sleeping-hits-record-high-with-18-rise-in-2018-19\" title=\"\">homelessness figures</a> show 8,855 people were seen sleeping rough in London during 2018-19, 18% higher than the previous 12 months.</p>",

A chain of emails from senior Home Office officials from December 2018 to May 2019 also shows that the clandestine programme ignores European privacy laws by passing rough sleepers\u2019 sensitive personal information directly to the Home Office without their consent. The scheme, which is still in a trial phase, is seen by charities and campaigners as the latest manifestation of the Home Office\u2019s much maligned \u201chostile environment\u201d policy. A previous plan to deport EU rough sleepers was defeated 18 months ago when the high court deemed it unlawful and discriminatory. But the Home Office, apparently undeterred, has rolled out a remarkably similar new scheme which, according to an internal email, will lead to \u201cenforcement in some cases\u201d \u2013 deportation \u2013 and targets \u201cnon-UK\u201d and non-EEA (European Economic Area) rough sleepers, which after Brexit will include EU nationals. Gracie Bradley, policy and campaigns manager for the human rights charity Liberty, said: \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful that the Home Office, local authorities, and charities are attempting to turn trusted homelessness outreach workers into border guards. Homelessness charities must refuse complicity in the hostile environment.\u201d A spokesman for the Public Interest Law Centre, which won the high court case, said: \u201cIt\u2019s now clear the Home Office \u2013 with the Greater London Authority, local councils and some homelessness charities \u2013 is trying to resurrect this discriminatory policy under a different guise.\u201d The correspondence reveals that some refugee charities have already been asked to forward cases to the programme, called the Rough Sleeper Support Service (RSSS), and at least one has agreed. Emails also reveal that homeless charity St Mungo\u2019s has attended meetings with the Home Office to discuss allowing outreach workers to enter a homeless person\u2019s data into RSSS without their consent. An email, dated 10 April 2019 from a Home Office official, confirmed the scheme \u201cprovides a single point of contact for LAs [local authorities] to receive rapid immigration status checks on non-UK national rough sleepers\u201d. It also explains why it wants to bypass privacy laws: \u201cA system relying on consent to comply with the GDPR [EU General Data Protection Regulation] would be vulnerable to individuals withdrawing consent.\u201d Another email, dated 18 February 2019 to GLA officials, shows that targeting homeless individuals would be prompt, saying \u201cimmigration [status] checks are completed on rough sleepers within 24 hours of a referral\u201d. Obtained through freedom of information requests from Liberty, the correspondence says the scheme is spearheaded by the lead officer for previous immigration enforcement operations and will be \u201cutilised to resolve the non-EEA national rough sleepers situations\u201d. The emails also chronicle Home Office frustration that the programme is still in the test phase because of a failure to agree a data-sharing deal with charities and local authorities. The emails show significant opposition from charities with \u201cpush back\u201d from several including St Mungo\u2019s and migrants advocacy group Praxis, who warn of \u201creputational risks\u201d for groups linked to the scheme. According to one email, Praxis raised several concerns, including that the scheme risked \u201cpoorly made decisions\u201d, was unnecessary and that it was \u201cunclear if RSSS referral would make detaining and removal of rough sleepers at their reporting appointments more likely\u201d. The charity raises fears that the programme will be primarily geared at removing rough sleepers. \u201cThere appear to be no immigration decision-makers in the RSSS, just immigration officers. The culture embedded in the RSSS seems to be one of enforcement,\u201d it said in an email sent on 3 May 2016. Even as the scheme was conceived, fears existed that it would be controversial. One email, sent on 18 December 2018, from a GLA officer to the Home Office, cites a \u201cpossibility of bad press surrounding the RSSS and there needs to be a clear line on what this team is and how it can help ensure no one dies on the streets\u201d. Although some emails show that sharing information with the Home Office could help prioritise a person\u2019s case and ensure homelessness charities offered the right support, Bradley said referrals will likely result in immigration enforcement action. She said ministers should be concentrating on combating the root causes of homelessness rather than targeting rough sleepers. \u201cConsent and data protection should also be at the heart of our interactions with public institutions,\u201d she added. The Public Law Interest Centre spokesman added: \u201cDespite its name, the new RSSS offers no \u2018support\u2019 to homeless migrants living in the UK. It is an \u2018hostile environment\u2019 measure in all but name.\u201d A St Mungo\u2019s spokesperson said the charity had met Home Office staff \u201cto find ways to respond more quickly\u201d to non-UK cases. \u201cIn particular, we are seeking to ensure people who may use the service do so based on informed consent and legal advice from a registered immigration adviser,\u201d they added. A Home Office spokesman said the RSSS was set up \u201cto help resolve the immigration status of non-UK nationals sleeping rough, either granting lawful status or providing documentation. This enables individuals to access support or assists them in leaving the UK where appropriate.\u201d He added: \u201cThe service prioritises support work on outstanding cases and helps to resolve status issues.\u201d A London mayoral spokesperson said: \u201cHeavy-handed enforcement is not the solution to rough sleeping and our services will have no part in it. We have made absolutely clear to the Home Office that we do not support their approach or any other that victimises people sleeping rough.\u201d The latest homelessness figures show 8,855 people were seen sleeping rough in London during 2018-19, 18% higher than the previous 12 months.",

      "bodyText": "Tory MPs have not been able to agree on very much since the momentous decision by voters to leave the EU. Yet as they headed back to their constituencies last week, there was one prediction that, for once, united them all. Figures from across the party agreed that Boris Johnson is odds-on to be the party\u2019s next leader and to enter Downing Street. One cabinet minister, among those to have reluctantly accepted that view, had one word to sum up their feelings: \u201cGulp.\u201d Delight, anger and disillusionment were expressed by Tory MPs in anticipation that the former foreign secretary will finally grasp the crown he has coveted for so long. Even among some of those backing his candidacy, there is an acknowledgment that they are taking a major gamble that could have serious implications not just for the party, but for the future of the UK. Johnson, who is currently poised to secure more than 70% of the membership\u2019s vote according to current polling, on Saturday received a standing ovation at a hustings in Nottingham. He also received endorsements from the Times, the Telegraph and the influential ConservativeHome website. For MPs concerned about his threat to leave the EU with no deal at the end of October, his clear lead has imbued a sense of determination. \u201cI\u2019ve had my period of mourning a long time ago,\u201d said one. \u201cIt is going to be him. The key now is making sure we do everything we can to ensure that certain things can be stopped.\u201d Other party opponents are angry at Jeremy Hunt, the outsider for the job, for a campaign that \u201cmade it easy\u201d for those with doubts about Johnson to back him. One minister pointed to \u201cill-judged remarks about business and hunting\u201d for preventing him from building support. Hunt had to backtrack after suggesting he would allow a vote on scrapping the ban on foxhunting. He also said that he would willingly tell people whose companies went bust after a no-deal Brexit that their sacrifice had been necessary. Hunt\u2019s perceived lack of momentum has been accompanied by support for Johnson from surprising places. Several MPs point to the endorsements from the likes of Matt Hancock, the health secretary seen as opposed to no deal, and former minister Damian Green, previously regarded as one of the party\u2019s leading Europhiles, as a sign that the party has decided to gamble that Johnson can deliver the electoral boost that his advocates claim he attracts. \u201cEveryone has their own motives, reasons and agendas,\u201d said one surprised MP, alluding to the age-old attraction of backing a winner. Can Johnson win back the votes of Leave voters currently attracted to Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party? The latest Opinium poll for the Observer suggests a 5% swing in votes among Leavers from the Brexit party back to the Tories. Johnson also has a clear supporter base: 53% of \u201cdiehard Leavers\u201d think he would make the best prime minister. Two thirds (64%) of \u201cdiehard Leavers\u201d, and 42% of all UK adults, believe that Britain will leave the EU within the current deadline if he becomes prime minister. Yet the poll still puts the Tories in second place, two points behind Labour, with the Brexit party netting an ominous 22% of the vote. Away from Johnson\u2019s vows on Brexit, there are two major issues causing concern across the party. The first is a criticism that has been aimed at both candidates \u2013 new spending commitments totalling tens of billions of pounds. A tax cuts splurge, totalling some \u00a320bn, combined with a pledge to increase school funding that could come at an even bigger price have concerned both MPs and party donors that the Tories\u2019 most reliable attack line against Labour \u2013 that it cannot be trusted with the economy \u2013 is at risk. As one major donor put it: \u201cWhat can one expect when the whiff of power is overwhelming and common sense thrown to the wind?\u201d Nicky Morgan, the Tory chair of the Treasury select committee, is more withering. \u201cThe Conservative party traditionally has a reputation for economic competence which is hard won and easily lost,\u201d she said. \u201cFrankly, both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt have been in cabinet. They have seen how hard it has been to get the public finances back into some sort of balance. They can\u2019t keep spending \u00a326bn over and over again, which is what we would expect to see from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party.\u201d The other flashing red light is the future of the UK and the risk posed by the kind of no-deal Brexit Johnson says he is willing to embrace.

      "bodyText": "It is now 11 long years since Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer (right) faced each other across the net at Wimbledon, mano a mano, in a 2008 final that was the greatest match in the Championship\u2019s history. Whisper it softly, but the two most successful male players in history look to be finally on a collision course again. Both men had Centre Court eating out of their hands on Saturday as they made light work of French opposition. First up was Nadal, the third seed, who gave a masterclass in defenestrating the two-times semi-finalist Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-2, 6-3, 6-2. Federer, seeded two this year, was nearly as impressive in beating Lucas Pouille 7-5, 6-2, 7-6 (4) in a match that threatened to be much closer than it proved. Sure, there is the small matter of Monday\u2019s last 16 matches to navigate \u2013 with Nadal facing Jo\u00e3o Sousa and Federer the big-serving Italian Matteo Berrettini \u2013 as well as Wednesday\u2019s quarter-finals. But assuming they do so they will meet in a semi-final for the ages. Nadal, in particular, looks in rude form. As another of his winners fizzed past an exasperated Tsonga in the final game of their match, and the Frenchman shook his head and looked up to the heavens, a spectator offered a pithy \u2013 but accurate verdict. \u201cJo, it\u2019s not your fault,\u201d they shouted. \u201cHe\u2019s too good.\u201d It was impossible to argue.

Johnson and his rival Jeremy Hunt were taking questions from local Conservative members who will be voting to choose the next leader of the party.

      "body": "<p>At 2.51am on Monday 15 July, engineers at India\u2019s national spaceport at Sriharikota will blast their Chandrayaan-2 probe into orbit around the Earth. It will be the most ambitious space mission the nation has attempted. For several days, the four-tonne spacecraft will be manoeuvred above our planet before a final injection burn of its engines will send it hurtling towards its destination: the moon.</p> <p>Exactly 50 years after the astronauts of Apollo 11 made their historic voyage to the Sea of Tranquillity, Chandrayaan-2 will repeat that journey \u2013 though on a slightly different trajectory. After the robot craft enters lunar orbit, it will gently drop a lander, named Vikram, on to the moon\u2019s surface near its south pole. A robot rover, Pragyan, will then be dispatched and, for the next two weeks, trundle across the local terrain, analysing the chemical composition of soil and rocks.</p> <p>The Indian spaceship will not be alone on the lunar surface, however.

Its arrival was later followed by the appearance of Beresheet, a probe built by the Israeli non-profit organisation SpaceIL. It reached the moon in April but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/apr/18/spacewatch-israel-private-moon-mission-crash-lands\" title=\"\">crash-landed</a>. SpaceIL has since announced that it intends to have another shot.</p> <p>At the same time, the US has pledged to set up lunar laboratories in the near future, while Europe and Russia have also revealed plans to launch complex missions. Suddenly, everyone\u2019s going to the moon.</p> <p>But why? What has suddenly made Earth\u2019s main satellite so popular? After Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin\u2019s historic mission in July 1969, public and political interest in future human space flight evaporated rapidly. Already bogged down in a vastly expensive war in Vietnam, the US government abandoned its Apollo programme.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0bc59a011949da45b3805b2aee398c5e6bec63b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0bc59a011949da45b3805b2aee398c5e6bec63b5/0_22_2480_1488/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Edwin \u2018Buzz\u2019 Aldrin is one of only four astronauts still alive to have walked on the moon, on 20 July 1969.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Buzz Aldrin on the moon on 20 July 1969.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Armstrong/Nasa/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The decision disappointed scientists but, given that Apollo was costing, at one point, 4% of the US federal budget, the cancellation was not surprising. Since then there have been only a handful of robot missions to the moon, and human ventures have been restricted to missions in low Earth orbit, with special attention being given to the International Space Station. However, that focus now appears to be changing to more distant goals.</p> <p>One reason for this shift is that the moon\u2019s exploitation has simply reached a stage that mirrors past explorations on Earth, says David Parker, director of human and robotic exploration for the European Space Agency. He sees particular parallels with our conquest of the south pole.</p> <p>\u201cThe timetable of the exploration of Antarctica mirrors that of the moon in an uncannily close manner,\u201d Parker says. \u201cAt the beginning of the century, there was a race to reach the south pole and then no one went back for 50 years \u2013 just like the moon in the 60s. Then we started building bases in Antarctica. We are now approaching that stage with our exploitation of the moon.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/gallery/2019/jul/06/transmission-from-the-sea-of-tranquility-to-planet-earth\">Transmission: from the Sea of Tranquility to planet Earth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Antarctica was opened up by technological advances \u2013 motorised vehicles, air transport, radio, and other developments \u2013 that are mirrored in the new sciences of machine learning, sensor technology and robotics. These promise to transform lunar colonisation in one crucially important way: by reducing the need for the continual presence of humans in hostile environments.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a huge cost gap between manned and unmanned missions, and it is increasing all the time,\u201d says Britain\u2019s astronomer royal, Martin Rees. \u201cWith each advance in robots and miniaturisation there is less need to put a man or woman into space or on to the moon, and that saves money.\u201d For a space agency like Nasa, which has to manage on a budget that is little more than 10% of funding in its heyday, that is certainly a key issue.</p> <p>And the success of China\u2019s Chang\u2019e-4 probe provides an example of what can be achieved without human involvement. It is the first vehicle ever to alight on the moon\u2019s far side, and has continued to operate without problems, despite having to survive prolonged periods when temperatures have plummeted to below minus 180C during lunar nights. (These last for 14 Earth days. Apollo schedules were planned to make sure astronauts landed only during daytime on the moon.)</p> <p>Exploiting these advances in robotics to aid human activity on the moon will form the backbone of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/may/25/liftoff-the-new-race-to-the-moon-begins-elon-musk-jeff-bezos-donald-trump-nasa-lunar-gateway\" title=\"\">the forthcoming US Lunar Gateway project</a>. Nasa plans to use America\u2019s giant Space Launch System rockets and Orion crew-carrying capsules \u2013 both in the final stages of development \u2013 to build a smaller version of the International Space Station that would orbit the moon. Partners from Europe, Canada, Japan and other countries have been invited to take part in Gateway, which would be constructed over the next decade.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c79cde62ab3e60a6086e74363777f5fd8373031\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c79cde62ab3e60a6086e74363777f5fd8373031/0_188_3508_2105/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An artist\u2019s impression of the Nasa\u2019s Gateway project\u2019s Orion spacecraft with Heracles ascent element docked.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An artist\u2019s impression of the Nasa\u2019s Gateway project\u2019s Orion spacecraft with Heracles ascent element docked.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ESA/ATG Medialab</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Gateway would be used by astronauts to operate robots working on the lunar surface a few dozen kilometres below them. These automated machines would be used to set up radio telescopes, to harvest minerals, to search for ice and water and to study how lunar rocks could be used as building materials for a lunar colony. Ultimately a craft would one day carry humans down to work on the moon in colonies prepared for them by robots.</p> <p>\u201cAnd that is good news for Europe,\u201d adds Parker. The European Space Agency is collaborating with Nasa over Gateway\u2019s construction \u2013 by providing the propulsion units for the Orion spaceships that will ferry astronauts to the Gateway station in lunar orbit. \u201cWe should therefore be in a strong position to have a European astronaut taken to the moon,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The scientific gains from studying the moon from missions such as Gateway would be considerable, adds Jeffrey Kargel, at the Planetary Science Institute in Tuscon, Arizona \u2013 a scientist who is particularly keen to exploit the moon\u2019s geological history. On Earth, tectonic processes have wiped out rock records before 3.8 billion years ago. \u201cBut on the moon we already know that Earth-derived meteorites [rocks blasted out from an impact with Earth] are preserved in accessible samples gathered by Apollo astronauts,\u201d Kargel says. \u201cFrom early Earth meteorites we could learn about the origins of our planet\u2019s continents, the first traces of an ocean on Earth, the composition of the primordial atmosphere \u2013 and the origin of life.\u201d</p> <p>Parker is equally enthusiastic about the moon\u2019s potential for study. \u201cIt has lain virtually undisturbed for the last 4.5 billion years,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is a museum of the history of the solar system.\u201d He argues that the potential rewards from such a lunar outpost mirror those already gained from bases set up in Antarctica. \u201cThe hole in Earth\u2019s ozone layer was discovered by polar scientists who are also doing crucial work on the impact of climate change and global warming on our planet. That is the kind of return we could get from setting up Gateway.\u201d</p> <p>There are other reasons to return to the moon, however. For many space enthusiasts, its exploration and exploitation is necessary if we are to make the next giant step in space: sending people to Mars. \u201cThat is the real goal for humanity,\u201d says Parker. \u201cHowever, getting humans there safely is going to be an incredibly difficult undertaking. We will have to learn first how to conquer the moon.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Soon there will be a time when there are no humans left with first-hand memory of another world. I will find that sad</p> <footer> <cite>Martin Rees, astronomer royal</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In building and running the International Space Station, humans have learned how to master space close to Earth. It orbits about 400 kilometres above the Earth, says Parker. \u201cBy contrast, the moon orbits 400,000 kilometres distant from the Earth, a thousand times farther away. Mastering a hostile environment that distant will require us overcoming all sorts of technological hurdles. Then we will be better armed when we start looking at Mars, which is 400 million kilometres away \u2013 a million times farther from Earth than the space station. This is going to be a long process.\u201d</p> <p>Rees sounds a note of caution. \u201cThere is a tendency to see Mars as the solution to all our problems on Earth. We will just move on to a new planet and save our species. But that is a dangerous delusion. We have to solve Earth\u2019s problems here and now. Coping with climate change may seem daunting but it will be a doddle compared with surviving on Mars.\u201d</p> <p>However, there is another, more poignant reason for returning to the moon and it is one that focuses on the individuals who visited 50 years ago.

      "bodyText": "At 2.51am on Monday 15 July, engineers at India\u2019s national spaceport at Sriharikota will blast their Chandrayaan-2 probe into orbit around the Earth. It will be the most ambitious space mission the nation has attempted. For several days, the four-tonne spacecraft will be manoeuvred above our planet before a final injection burn of its engines will send it hurtling towards its destination: the moon. Exactly 50 years after the astronauts of Apollo 11 made their historic voyage to the Sea of Tranquillity, Chandrayaan-2 will repeat that journey \u2013 though on a slightly different trajectory. After the robot craft enters lunar orbit, it will gently drop a lander, named Vikram, on to the moon\u2019s surface near its south pole. A robot rover, Pragyan, will then be dispatched and, for the next two weeks, trundle across the local terrain, analysing the chemical composition of soil and rocks. The Indian spaceship will not be alone on the lunar surface, however. China\u2019s Chang\u2019e-4 has been operating flawlessly since it landed on the far side of the moon in January. Its arrival was later followed by the appearance of Beresheet, a probe built by the Israeli non-profit organisation SpaceIL. It reached the moon in April but crash-landed. SpaceIL has since announced that it intends to have another shot. At the same time, the US has pledged to set up lunar laboratories in the near future, while Europe and Russia have also revealed plans to launch complex missions. Suddenly, everyone\u2019s going to the moon. But why? What has suddenly made Earth\u2019s main satellite so popular? After Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin\u2019s historic mission in July 1969, public and political interest in future human space flight evaporated rapidly. Already bogged down in a vastly expensive war in Vietnam, the US government abandoned its Apollo programme. The decision disappointed scientists but, given that Apollo was costing, at one point, 4% of the US federal budget, the cancellation was not surprising. Since then there have been only a handful of robot missions to the moon, and human ventures have been restricted to missions in low Earth orbit, with special attention being given to the International Space Station. However, that focus now appears to be changing to more distant goals. One reason for this shift is that the moon\u2019s exploitation has simply reached a stage that mirrors past explorations on Earth, says David Parker, director of human and robotic exploration for the European Space Agency. He sees particular parallels with our conquest of the south pole. \u201cThe timetable of the exploration of Antarctica mirrors that of the moon in an uncannily close manner,\u201d Parker says. \u201cAt the beginning of the century, there was a race to reach the south pole and then no one went back for 50 years \u2013 just like the moon in the 60s. Then we started building bases in Antarctica. We are now approaching that stage with our exploitation of the moon.\u201d Antarctica was opened up by technological advances \u2013 motorised vehicles, air transport, radio, and other developments \u2013 that are mirrored in the new sciences of machine learning, sensor technology and robotics. These promise to transform lunar colonisation in one crucially important way: by reducing the need for the continual presence of humans in hostile environments. \u201cThere is a huge cost gap between manned and unmanned missions, and it is increasing all the time,\u201d says Britain\u2019s astronomer royal, Martin Rees. \u201cWith each advance in robots and miniaturisation there is less need to put a man or woman into space or on to the moon, and that saves money.\u201d For a space agency like Nasa, which has to manage on a budget that is little more than 10% of funding in its heyday, that is certainly a key issue. And the success of China\u2019s Chang\u2019e-4 probe provides an example of what can be achieved without human involvement. It is the first vehicle ever to alight on the moon\u2019s far side, and has continued to operate without problems, despite having to survive prolonged periods when temperatures have plummeted to below minus 180C during lunar nights. (These last for 14 Earth days. Apollo schedules were planned to make sure astronauts landed only during daytime on the moon.) Exploiting these advances in robotics to aid human activity on the moon will form the backbone of the forthcoming US Lunar Gateway project. Nasa plans to use America\u2019s giant Space Launch System rockets and Orion crew-carrying capsules \u2013 both in the final stages of development \u2013 to build a smaller version of the International Space Station that would orbit the moon. Partners from Europe, Canada, Japan and other countries have been invited to take part in Gateway, which would be constructed over the next decade. Gateway would be used by astronauts to operate robots working on the lunar surface a few dozen kilometres below them. These automated machines would be used to set up radio telescopes, to harvest minerals, to search for ice and water and to study how lunar rocks could be used as building materials for a lunar colony. Ultimately a craft would one day carry humans down to work on the moon in colonies prepared for them by robots. \u201cAnd that is good news for Europe,\u201d adds Parker. The European Space Agency is collaborating with Nasa over Gateway\u2019s construction \u2013 by providing the propulsion units for the Orion spaceships that will ferry astronauts to the Gateway station in lunar orbit. \u201cWe should therefore be in a strong position to have a European astronaut taken to the moon,\u201d he says. The scientific gains from studying the moon from missions such as Gateway would be considerable, adds Jeffrey Kargel, at the Planetary Science Institute in Tuscon, Arizona \u2013 a scientist who is particularly keen to exploit the moon\u2019s geological history. On Earth, tectonic processes have wiped out rock records before 3.8 billion years ago. \u201cBut on the moon we already know that Earth-derived meteorites [rocks blasted out from an impact with Earth] are preserved in accessible samples gathered by Apollo astronauts,\u201d Kargel says. \u201cFrom early Earth meteorites we could learn about the origins of our planet\u2019s continents, the first traces of an ocean on Earth, the composition of the primordial atmosphere \u2013 and the origin of life.\u201d Parker is equally enthusiastic about the moon\u2019s potential for study. \u201cIt has lain virtually undisturbed for the last 4.5 billion years,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is a museum of the history of the solar system.\u201d He argues that the potential rewards from such a lunar outpost mirror those already gained from bases set up in Antarctica. \u201cThe hole in Earth\u2019s ozone layer was discovered by polar scientists who are also doing crucial work on the impact of climate change and global warming on our planet. That is the kind of return we could get from setting up Gateway.\u201d There are other reasons to return to the moon, however. For many space enthusiasts, its exploration and exploitation is necessary if we are to make the next giant step in space: sending people to Mars. \u201cThat is the real goal for humanity,\u201d says Parker. \u201cHowever, getting humans there safely is going to be an incredibly difficult undertaking. We will have to learn first how to conquer the moon.\u201d In building and running the International Space Station, humans have learned how to master space close to Earth. It orbits about 400 kilometres above the Earth, says Parker. \u201cBy contrast, the moon orbits 400,000 kilometres distant from the Earth, a thousand times farther away. Mastering a hostile environment that distant will require us overcoming all sorts of technological hurdles. Then we will be better armed when we start looking at Mars, which is 400 million kilometres away \u2013 a million times farther from Earth than the space station. This is going to be a long process.\u201d Rees sounds a note of caution. \u201cThere is a tendency to see Mars as the solution to all our problems on Earth. We will just move on to a new planet and save our species. But that is a dangerous delusion. We have to solve Earth\u2019s problems here and now. Coping with climate change may seem daunting but it will be a doddle compared with surviving on Mars.\u201d However, there is another, more poignant reason for returning to the moon and it is one that focuses on the individuals who visited 50 years ago. Only six Apollo missions made it to the lunar surface, each crewed by two men. Thus only 12 humans have ever walked on the moon. They all were male; were born in the 20s and 30s in midwest America; were either only children or the eldest in their families \u2013 and, with the exception of Apollo 15\u2019s James Irwin, all had been Boy Scouts. On their way to and from the moon, each earned $8 a day, minus a fee for a bed on their Apollo spacecraft. The crucial point is that these are the only humans who have ever had first-hand experience of standing on another world and only four of them are still alive: Apollo 11\u2019s Buzz Aldrin (now aged 89), Apollo 15\u2019s David Scott (87), Apollo 16\u2019s Charles Duke (83) and Apollo 17\u2019s Harrison Schmitt (84). \u201cGiven their age I think we could soon find ourselves in a time when there are no humans left with first-hand memory of another world,\u201d added Rees. \u201cLike millions of other people, I will find that sad.\u201d The question facing space scientists is therefore straightforward: is there a chance another human might walk on the surface of the moon before the last Apollo moonwalkers die? Until recently, the answer would have been \u201cprobably not\u201d. The timetable for Gateway\u2019s construction was modest and slow, and astronauts would probably not have used it to reach the lunar surface for at least a decade. But that timetable was recently thrown into confusion when the US vice-president, Mike Pence, announced in March that the White House was directing Nasa to accelerate the human component of the Gateway project so that astronauts could fly down to the moon\u2019s surface by 2024. Many doubt that this will be possible. No lander craft to make this descent has yet been designed, for example. Nevertheless there is the prospect that this change of timetable will allow a US astronaut in the near future to step on to the lunar surface so that a surviving Apollo astronaut will witness another human following in their footsteps. The crucial point is that when the Apollo astronauts were flying to the moon, it seemed science fiction had come true, says Rees. \u201cIt would be good if we can bring back that sense of wonder, if nothing else.\u201d",

decades ago calling gay men \u201ctank-topped bumboys\u201d. </p> \n  <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got the next prime minister using homophobic language,\u201d Khan said. \u201cWhen you speak to members of the LGBTQ+ community, they will tell you that some of the homophobia they suffered, the attackers used this language, the same sort of language he\u2019s used. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat I want to see from our prime minister, if it is Boris Johnson, it looks like it will be, is him realising that language matters.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Johnson has been criticised for remarks including calling gay men \u201ctank-topped bumboys\u201d in a 1998 Telegraph column unearthed by the Business Insider website.</p> \n  <p>The former Mayor of London had also condemned \u201cLabour\u2019s appalling agenda, encouraging the teaching of homosexuality in schools, and all the rest of it\u201d in an article for The Spectator in 2000.</p> \n  <p>However, on Saturday, Johnson, declared that \u201cBritain leads the world in LGBT+ equality\u201d and tweeted what appeared to be a historic photo of himself with a pink cowboy hat.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\"

      "bodyText": "After opening the Pride parade, Sadiq Khan attacked Tory leadership frontrunner Boris Johnson for using \u201chomophobic language\u201d, in apparent reference to an article he wrote two decades ago calling gay men \u201ctank-topped bumboys\u201d. Later on Saturday, Johnson, declared that \u201cBritain leads the world in LGBT+ equality\u201d and tweeted what appeared to be a historic photo of himself wearing a pink cowboy hat (see 2.28pm). #LwiththeT group of trans-inclusive lesbians led the parade and there was no repeat of last year\u2019s controversy, when anti-transgender campaigners forced their way to the front of the parade. Campaigners said that it was heartwarming how supportive this year\u2019s Pride was of trans people (see 5.53pm). Extinction Rebellion welcomed Pride in London\u2019s declaration of a climate emergency, which committed the event to becoming carbon neutral by next year (see 11.32pm). Grammy and Tony Award winner Billy Porter appeared on the new World Stage, before his performance in Trafalgar Square, while Ren\u00e9e Zellweger gave an exclusive preview of her new film JUDY. As well as the Mayor of London, defence secretary Penny Mordaunt, shadow education secretary Angela Rayner, and Labour backbencher Stephen Doughty attended the march. Attendance numbers were still to be confirmed, but organisers had expected about 1.5m people after an expansion of the event. The Met said the protest celebration passed peacefully. The event marked 50 years since the Stonewall uprising in New York - a moment which changed the face of the gay rights movement around the world. Pride in London organisers told the Guardian: Today has been a great success, and it\u2019s been fantastic to see so many groups and individuals come and march with us. On the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising it\u2019s clear that Pride is still vital for our community, and that despite our victories we still have far to go when it comes to LGBT+ equality.\u201d Here is a report from the Observer\u2019s Nosheen Iqbal on today\u2019s parade. Thanks for joining us. We hope everyone had a great day, and wish you all an enjoyable evening. Here is a selection of photos from today. Last year, the organisers of the annual celebration apologised following the event after anti-transgender campaigners forced their way to the front of the parade and were allowed to lead the march. This year, activists had planned how to mobilise in such a case and printed thousands of flyers advising people on how to respond. However, events did not repeat themselves and those who were supposed to lead the parade did so. Campaigner Nim Ralph said that it was heartwarming how supportive this year\u2019s Pride was of trans people. People were desperate for our flyers so that they could wave a trans flag saying \u201cTrans people to the front\u201d and a group of Trans folks marched at the front of Stonewall\u2019s Together in Pride bloc and the crowds cheered and screamed when they saw the trans flags coming. There were also tonnes of groups marching in explicit solidarity with trans people; from lesbians to leather men. It actually really reassured me that despite how transphobic the British press has been in the last year, the community has our backs. Guardian columnist Owen Jones has posted this video. There is frustration that a bloc including queer activist group Lesbians and Gays Support the Migrants (LGSM), the Outside Project and African Rainbow Family who were were waiting to march at the end of Pride, were temporarily stopped by stewards and police. Following a stand-off, the groups were eventually allowed to join the march \u2013 although they had not applied for a spot in the parade because they \u201ccould not afford to\u201d. Campaigners criticised the pricing principle, as well as the parade concept, arguing it was striking that certain people from some institutions could easily join the march, while others from community groups, including refugees and homeless people, could not. Sam Bjorn, a spokesperson for LGSM said: Pride in London is celebrating 50 years since Stonewall, yet we\u2019re met with lines of police and \u2018stewards\u2019 when marching to fight for those in our community suffering the brunt of oppression. We\u2019re marching with LGBT+ people seeking asylum and homeless LGBT+ people. They should be celebrated, not the banks and security companies that are holding us down. As the march continues to wind down, there are a number of venues people can now head to for as part of the Pride events today. Here\u2019s what\u2019s on this evening. There were more than 80 officers marching alongside everyone, and a Met police spokesperson has said there were no arrests and everything so far has been \u201cpeaceful and happy\u201d in central London. And here are the best books to help with coming out, courtesy of novelist Charlotte Mendelson. Simon Cour-Polais, 62, marched with Opening Doors London, the LGBT over-50s group. He has been with ODL for six prides, but has lost count of how many times he has attended the event in his life time. \u201cIt feels wonderful, absolutely wonderful,\u201d he said, when asked how it felt to be marching with ODL. \u201cYears ago I couldn\u2019t even have conceived of doing this, to be with my own age group marching down London.\u201d Elsewhere, Marteene Pringle was marching with Sparkle, a national charity for transgender adults, based in Manchester. It\u2019s about solidarity with everybody. We\u2019re all human and we all wanna march together. Being transgender there\u2019s a lot of people that hate transgender people, but we\u2019re now in a good group where we get support everywhere we go now. Which is what we want. It\u2019s about looking after the young transgender people on the bus behind it. Being transgender is pretty new and it\u2019s now coming to the forefront which is what we need it to do. The group Lesbians for Trans Rights marched as part of the Queer Liberation contingent. Claire, 27, said she marched alongside the group \u201cto show that lesbians are not threatened by trans rights, in fact it is the opposite queer liberation includes all of us.\u201d She criticised last year\u2019s anti-trans protestors who disrupted the Pride parade by lying down on the ground at the front of the march, carrying signs with slogans such as \u201cTransactivists erase lesbians\u201d \u201cLesbians here are mobilising because last year lesbian terfs tried to hijack Pride to push their transphobic agenda and we say not in our name,\u201d Claire added. Shahmir Sanni, the man who exposed Vote Leave\u2019s overspending ahead of the Brexit vote was outed as gay from within the prime minister\u2019s office before being asked to leave his job within days, has spoken to the Guardian. The energy is great, there\u2019s lots more representation for trans people and people of colour so it\u2019s good to see that.\u201d He says it\u2019s especially important for people to march this year, given the issues affecting the community. I think over the last year we\u2019ve seen a range of extremely homophobic attacks against queer people. And we\u2019ve seen an institutional failure and a failure by the media to call out transphobic sentiment. Actor Sir Ian McKellen, perhaps most famous for his role as Gandalf in the Lord of the Rings, walking through Piccadilly Circus earlier. Ruth Hunt, marching in her final Pride as head of Stonewall, was with a large group from her charity, UK Black Pride, Imaan, Mermaids, Sparkle, Level Up and Para Pride. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is increased hatred towards the fringes of our communities, so us standing in solidarity together is important,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it just shows that Pride is way more than a party.\u201d Seemaabutt, who is holding the Allah loves diversity sign, is a drag queen from Birmingham and a volunteer with Imaan, a Europe-wide charity supporting LGBTQI Muslims. They have been marching in Pride events for over twenty years. \u201cIt\u2019s really important for Muslim LGBT people to be visible, because we have so many members that are not able to be here because they are afraid that their families may find out. So it\u2019s really important for us to be visible for our community.\u201d Frank Bartlett, a 38-year old historic property steward, is marching with the Asexual Visibilty and Education Network. \u201cIn my case I\u2019m repulsed, the thought of the whole thing disgusts me, other people they just have a low sex drive or do it to please partners. But essentially we\u2019re the 1% of the population who don\u2019t really want to have sex.\u201d He said there is still a lot of ignorance about asexual people. \u201cEven with young people I have to explain what I am because they don\u2019t understand it. 50 years ago people don\u2019t know that gay people existed and now they see that gay people exist. so hopefully they\u2019ll see the sign go by and see that we exist.\u201d Chris Collie, right, is marching with Channel 4, his husband Manish, and his two-year-old daughter, and they intend to hang out and enjoy themselves until their daughter gets cranky and they have to go home. \u201cIt\u2019s her second Pride, but first marching,\u201d said Chris. \u201cIt\u2019s a great day she\u2019s getting loads of attention and loving it.\u201d Pop star Sam Smith is marching with Queer Britain, the organisation trying to put together London\u2019s first LGBTQ museum. \u201cThis is my first ever Pride,\u201d he said emphatically. \u201cI\u2019ve always been in parties but I\u2019ve never actually been on the march and I feel honoured and prouder than I\u2019ve ever been.\u201d It\u2019s cloudy in London on Saturday, but that\u2019s not casting a shadow on people\u2019s mood. There\u2019s been plenty of dancing, drinking and revelling at Pride 2019. The event has brought families, work colleagues and activists together to march and declare London an LGBT friendly city. One mother, who didn\u2019t wish to be named, said she brought he daughter to pride to support the cause and the community. \u201cWe are all in this together,\u201d she added. They\u2019ve marched to sound systems that have blared out a range of music from Spice Girls to Beyonc\u00e9. Amidst accusations of pink washing, plenty of political groups have come out to make their voices heard at pride. From Queer Strike to Lesbians for Trans Rights, plenty of groups have brought the issues of gentrification, racism, and transphobia to London pride. While many have criticised the number of corporations in the march, some say it\u2019s a positive that companies want to show off their LGBT credentials. The defence secretary Penny Mordaunt has been getting into the swing of things. Performer TeTe Bang and drag queen Bourgeoisie are marching with the W Hotel. \u201cI\u2019m gonna walk around and soak it up,\u201d said Bourgeoisie, when asked about his plans after the parade. \u201cIt\u2019s really rare that I get a chance to get involved in Pride and be proud, instead of just selling my soul to a corporate company.\u201d The commercialisation of Pride has once again been a big topic of conversation among people in the LGBTQ community. For performers, it\u2019s made Pride season all the more lucrative. \u201cI think as long as people are being well paid then sop up the queer talent but pay them very well,\u201d said Bourgeoisie. TeTe Bang added: \u201cAs long as you support it the rest of the year then it\u2019s ok.\u201d Lady Phyll, the co-founder, trustee and executive director of UK Black Pride, is marching with UK Black Pride alongside, Imaan, Stonewall and Mermaids. She says it\u2019s her first time marching in London Pride for a long time. \u201cWhen you think about Stonewall 50 [the 50th anniversary of the historic riots] and where Pride originated from, it\u2019s about celebrating our trans siblings, and also our queer muslim siblings all across the board,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you can march: march.\u201d Lady Phyll will also be at Haggerston Park tomorrow for UK Black Pride, Europe\u2019s largest celebration for lesbian, gay and bisexual people of African, Asian, Middle Eastern, Latin American and Caribbean heritage. Here are marchers from Imaan. The prime minister Theresa May has wished everyone a happy Pride. Ben, who is holding the sign saying Binosaurus Rex, is marching with the Bi Pandas \u2013 on the first occasion the groups has marched at Pride. We\u2019re bi and we\u2019re trying to bring Pride back as a protest, rather than a big rainbow capitalism, happy-clappy day. And why pandas? Iris Sparkles, second from the right, said: Pandas are considered a bit of a joke icon for the bisexual community because there\u2019s an in-joke that we\u2019re actually very bad at having sex with each other, much like pandas. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has attacked Tory leadership frontrunner Boris Johnson in apparent reference to an article he wrote two decades ago calling gay men \u201ctank-topped bumboys\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the next prime minister using homophobic language,\u201d Khan said. \u201cWhen you speak to members of the LGBTQ+ community, they will tell you that some of the homophobia they suffered, the attackers used this language, the same sort of language he\u2019s used. \u201cWhat I want to see from our prime minister, if it is Boris Johnson, it looks like it will be, is him realising that language matters.\u201d Johnson has been criticised for remarks including calling gay men \u201ctank-topped bumboys\u201d in a 1998 Telegraph column unearthed by the Business Insider website. The former Mayor of London had also condemned \u201cLabour\u2019s appalling agenda, encouraging the teaching of homosexuality in schools, and all the rest of it\u201d in an article for The Spectator in 2000. However, on Saturday, Johnson, declared that \u201cBritain leads the world in LGBT+ equality\u201d and tweeted what appeared to be a historic photo of himself with a pink cowboy hat. Joseph Canestrala, dressed in a blow-up unicorn costume, told the Press Association: \u201cI\u2019m from southern Italy and the mentality there is so closed. I came to London five years ago because I want to be free.\u201d The chef, 28, added: \u201cYou meet more people. It\u2019s more open, you can find a partner. Every year I come to Pride. I love it.\u201d Ilhan, 25, came early to secure a spot to watch the parade with her friend. \u201cI come to pride because it\u2019s the only time you feel completely safe to express all of yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be unapologetic about all of I am.\u201d She said Pride needed to do more to be more representative, particularly of the black LGBTQ community, but recognised progress could be slow. Asked if she planned to get through her entire arsenal of alcohol, she replied: \u201cObviously.\u201d In support of the Terrence Higgins Trust \u2013 a charity which raises awareness about HIV and sexual health \u2013 the shadow education secretary Angela Rayner is on the march! Cisco, 49, came dressed in matching outfits with his two close friends. When asked if he was from London, he laughed, and said: \u201cWe\u2019re from Jersey, we\u2019re not fucking local.\u201d He laughed again when asked if it was this was his first London pride. \u201cDoes it look like my first pride? Absolutely not. I\u2019m an old man now!\u201d He said he comes back every year because of the love that everyone shows. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a friend whose a curtain maker and he made the outfit six years ago and we\u2019ve worn it millions of times.\u201d \u201cAll the lovely people and it\u2019s free loving - you can kiss and hug everybody you like,\u201d he said. As for the outfits, he added that a friend from Jersey, whose a curtain maker, made the outfit six years ago. \u201cWe\u2019ve worn it millions of times.\u201d Leo, 18, has been marching with a sign offering free hugs and he\u2019s been showered with them. \u201cIt\u2019s been very busy and I\u2019ve had so so many hugs.\u201d He travelled down from Essex for his second London Pride, saying he made the sign because \u201cI just loving showing love and it\u2019s really fun.\u201d Here is our brief explainer on Pride. Cristel Amiss, 68, is marching under a \u201cQueer Strike\u201d banner. We\u2019re here today to get support for Ms Mohamed, who is a refugee who fled Pakistan after her husband discovered she was a lesbian. While she got refugee status, the Home Office has refused to allow her to bring her son, who helped her and her sister to escape abuse. Amiss added that Mohamed\u2019s son is in hiding and currently at great risk for helping his mum escape. Ms Mohammed\u2019s appeal is heard on 20 August. We really have to support a young man like that who was ready to put his own life on the line. This should be the focus on pride not corporations. We want a world that cares about people, not about capitalism, not about money. As the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan launched the parade, he said the \u201cheartbreaking\u201d pictures of a bloodied lesbian couple attacked on a night bus showed the importance of Pride. Melania Geymonat and her partner, Chris, were beaten up by a group of young men for refusing to kiss in May, with the incident sparking widespread public outcry. Khan said the \u201chuge, huge progress\u201d in gay rights should be celebrated, but added \u201cwe must never be complacent\u201d. Mermaids, an organisation that supports gender diverse and transgender children and teenagers, is passing through the parade in a double-decker bus. Bucky, 20, who did not wish to give her real name, has come to the march with \u201cCaptain America\u201d. She moved to the UK from Germany about a year ago and is \u201cso excited\u201d to be at her first London Pride. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing, I absolutely love it. London is such a cool city with so many opportunities for work and to find love. It\u2019s my favourite city.\u201d That said, she was annoyed that part of the march is barricaded and only those with wristbands are allowed to march in that section. \u201cI don\u2019t like it very much because I didn\u2019t know you had to buy the wristbands and I want to march with everyone together.\u201d Benedetta, 32, and Elisa, 24, were handing out flyers for Women of Brixton, an anti-capitalist, inclusive and intersectional community group that they founded recently. \u201cWe want to bring the conversation back to capitalism and the issue of gentrification in our community,\u201d says Benedetta. She migrated from Italy some months ago, and explained how she found it strange there were so many corporations involved in the Pride celebrations. But Elisa said it was a good thing if it drew more people to the march. Some more photos from the march so far, as concertgoers amass on Trafalgar Square to see performances from Billy Porter, star of TV series Pose, along with Eurovision and X Factor singer Saara Aalto and RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race star William. Here\u2019s the full line up. Khan, who has spoken out against anti-LGBT hate crime in London, tweeted earlier: Jeremy Corbyn has been tweeting about Pride. The Labour leader wrote an article for Pink News yesterday urging everyone to reject what he said is a \u201chorrible\u201d anti-transgender rights campaign. Elsewhere, Theresa May\u2019s office posted this video on Thursday after Downing Street hosted a Pride reception. And Tory leadership contender Jeremy Hunt has also tweeted. Pink News posted this earlier, wishing everyone a happy Pride. And here is a note of caution from the organisers. Isaac, 24, is marching with the Out and Proud Africa LGBTI group for his first ever Pride march. He hadn\u2019t attended the event before because his parents did not know he was gay. \u201cNow I\u2019m out and they know that I am gay,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd now I don\u2019t fear anybody. I\u2019m proud of myself, I\u2019m proud of who I am.\u201d Campaign group Movement for Justice has criticised the government for preventing the return of an unlawfully deported Ugandan lesbian, after a high court judge ruled that the handling of her case was \u201cprocedurally unfair\u201d. Elsewhere, bus advertisements along the Pride route have been replaced with \u201calternative ads\u201d questioning why the Home Office, the Metropolitan police and global corporations are able to participate in this year\u2019s Pride while \u201cmarginalised groups are left watching on the sidelines because they are unable to afford spaces on the march\u201d. Sam Bjorn, a spokesperson for Lesbians and Gays Support the Migrants, said: You have to ask what London Pride is really for? While the Home Office are celebrated, the LGBT+ migrants that they have dehumanised, detained and forced to live in fear of deportation have to watch from the sidelines. He also pointed out that on the day in June when the Home Office changed its social media profile to the rainbow colours, it emerged that a gay rugby player was being deported from the UK. Bjorn added that 78% of asylum cases where the applicants were from the LGBT+ community were turned down. The Foreign Office, meanwhile, has been lauding its credentials, after four LGBT Syrian refugees arrived in the UK on Thursday \u2013 where they will be able to openly express their sexual identity when they join the Pride celebrations today. The group arrived in London this week after waiting for more than two years to be airlifted to safety. Their situation was resolved after the Guardian highlighted the plight of 15 LGBT Syrian refugees stranded in Turkey this year. Others in the group were expected to follow soon. Campaigners claimed yesterday that Pride in London has become too regimented and commercialised. Caroline Davies and Henry McDonald report: Peter Tatchell, one of the organisers of the UK\u2019s first Pride parade in 1972, criticised local authority-imposed limits on marcher numbers. \u201cIn the 1990s over 100,000 marched, and similar numbers would probably march today if the parade was not restricted,\u201d he said. \u201cPride has become so bureaucratic and regimented. LGBT+ individuals cannot join the parade, only organisations.\u201d He also voiced concerns that the onerous costs for road closures, barricades and parking suspensions imposed on Pride had forced it to rely heavily on corporate sponsorship. There was a danger of \u201cpinkwashing\u201d, he said. \u201cSome corporates seem to see Pride as a marketing opportunity to target LGBT+ customers.\u201d However, organisers said pure marketing was not allowed on the parade, and the LGBT+ policies of all participating brands had been carefully examined. Ahead of event\u2019s today, the Guardian\u2019s social platforms editor Eleni Stefanou spoke to six people about the importance of taking to the streets. Amani Saeed, a spoken word artist, described what feelings the word \u2018pride\u2019 called up for her. Until this year, I didn\u2019t understand the meaning of the word in terms of being proud of a facet of your identity. I stand at the crossroads of a barrage of intersections and can feel fragmented at times. I am constantly defined as not white, not straight, not something, instead of being defined by what I am. I now understand pride as a celebration of otherness. To be proud of being queer is to be proud of shattering expectations and norms, and embracing whatever expression, whatever love, we need in order to feel whole. Writer Otamere Guobadia said when questioned about his hopes for the future: That queerness does away with our binaries, our bizarre fixation on fixedness. My hope for the future is that it is truly, unabashedly queer. Queerness is evidence of more. It is a peek into the cauldron at the beginning of the universe. Evidence that we, in acting purportedly \u2018against nature\u2019, might ourselves expand it. It is evidence of the divine. Queerness is water from the stone, Lazarus from the depths, something from nothing. Organisers announced yesterday that they had declared a climate emergency in response to demands made by Extinction Rebellion, and said they aim to make the event carbon neutral by next year. This morning, XR LGBTIQ welcomed Pride in London\u2019s commitment, after they presented their demands in person two days ago. In recognising the problematic nature of the ecocidal profiteering of some of the groups in the parade they have acknowledged the basis of a third demand and we welcome their intention to address this between now and next year\u2019s event in London. We are in awe of the actions of rebels in London, across the UK, and internationally whose commitment to the rebellion has brought about this extraordinary statement. We are aware that we are a self-selecting group and that we cannot speak for anybody except ourselves. Some people will be disappointed that companies like BP and Exxon Mobile will be represented and heavily branded in the parade this year. Individuals and groups both within XR LGBTIQ and outside within the wider movement will make their own decisions on how to respond to that fact. We ask all rebels whether queer or not to treat everybody today with the respect that lies at the heart of the Extinction Rebellion message. Pride in London said in a statement on Friday: Having met with Extinction Rebellion LGBTIQ we are aligned on the fact that everyone needs to respond to the ecological crisis, and that minority causes are likely to be impacted most by planetary breakdown. For this reason, we are joining them in declaring a climate emergency and will be taking steps to review our impact to make Pride in London carbon neutral by 2020. We acknowledge the problematic nature of the ecocidal profiteering of some of the groups in the parade and will consider our next steps on this carefully, in consultation with our Community Advisory Board (who are currently recruiting an Environment &amp; Sustainability Representative), to hold businesses accountable to not just their support for the LGBTQI+ community when they take part in Pride, but also their impact on the planet year-round. The parade has been free from plastic glitter since 2017 and other environmentally friendly measures include volunteers being given a refillable bottle on the day. It also does not allow diesel powered ice cream vans into any of its areas. NHS staff will show their support for Pride by wearing a rainbow badge in a bid to break down barriers LGBT+ people can face when accessing healthcare. This is from the Press Association. The badges are \u201csimple visible symbols of support\u201d for people who may come across negative attitudes towards the LGBT+ community, the consultant behind the scheme said. Dr Michael Farquhar, who works at the Evelina London Children\u2019s Hospital, pioneered the initiative as part of a wider commitment to address LGBT+ healthcare challenges. As many as 150,000 doctors, nurses, cleaners, surgeons, midwives and other health service staff across around one in three of England\u2019s acute trusts have opted to wear the badge, which shows the NHS logo superimposed on the rainbow pride flag. NHS England said the scheme is aimed at helping patients identify staff they can talk to about health and wellbeing issues relating to gender and sexuality and showing that those staff will signpost them to resources to explain LGBT+ health issues. It is also an attempt to break down barriers LGBT+ people sometimes face in healthcare, including getting regular cancer screening. NHS England said that as well as the Rainbow Badge initiative, other NHS England trusts across the country are introducing schemes to focus on inclusion of the LGBT+ community. Dr Farquhar said: \u201cWe developed the Rainbow NHS badge model at Evelina London Children\u2019s Hospital to signal to LGBT+ people using our services that those wearing the badge are good people to talk to about these issues, but also to help challenge some of the negative attitudes towards LGBT+ people which research has shown sadly still persist across the NHS. \u201cMore personally, I know how much seeing simple visible symbols of support would have meant to me as a gay teenager.\u201d Dr Michael Brady, the new NHS national LGBT health adviser, said: \u201cEvery single part of our NHS should be a place where LGBT+ people are accepted and respected. \u201cThe Rainbow Badge scheme is a brilliant push by hard-working NHS staff, as part of our Long Term Plan for the health service, to show how much the LGBT+ community - patients and staff - is valued.\u201d NHS staff are among those taking part in the annual Pride in London parade today. Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of today\u2019s Pride events in London. Organisers say the march will be the biggest and most diverse yet, with as many as 1.5 million people predicted to turn out for the event, and some 600 groups \u2013 a 25% increase on last year \u2013 will march through central London. It comes 50 years after the Stonewall uprising in New York \u2013 a moment which changed the face of the gay rights movement around the world. Parade groups will honour five decades of activism, protests and victories, and those behind this year\u2019s march have said it is an opportunity for people to stand up against bigotry and hatred in all its forms. Alison Camps, co-chairman of Pride in London, said: As we take to the streets of London once again, it\u2019s vital that we remember that Pride is not just one day a year - we must fight for the rights of all members of our community all year round. In this momentous anniversary year, we must all take stock of how far we\u2019ve come, and of the contributions and sacrifices made by trans women of colour to get us to where we are today. Our main aim is to ensure that everyone who comes to Pride in London has a safe space to celebrate, protest or mark the occasion however they wish. We will not allow Pride to be used as a platform for hate and we encourage everyone to come out and join us today so we can stand together against bigotry and hatred in all its forms. There will be a new World Area at Golden Square in Soho, in an effort to increase the visibility of black, Asian and minority ethnic LGBT+ people. The event also has improved accessibility this year, including viewing platforms for the Trafalgar Square stage, sign language interpreters and captioning for all performances across two large screens, and accessible, gender-neutral toilets. The parade will begin at midday from Portland Place and finish on Whitehall. Please do send over your photos and stories to my Twitter or on mattha.busby.freelance@theguardian.com. The Guardian US recently ran a series on Pride at 50, here is the story of the riot that changed America\u2019s gay rights movement forever. Have a wonderful day!",

When her friend mentioned gaslighting, it was a relief to know that there was a term to describe her experience. Humphries, who has just spoken at the House of Commons about coercive control, says that single word gave her the vindication and courage she needed.</p> <p>Gaslighting is about systemically dissolving another person\u2019s sense of self, until they\u2019re questioning their every move and instinct. It\u2019s a pernicious process whereupon reality is distorted, inducing a state of psychological near-paralysis in the disoriented, anxious victim. When it happens within a romantic relationship, imagine the person you\u2019re supposed to feel safest and happiest with, spinning you around, until you can\u2019t breathe, or get your bearings. Now imagine that happening all the time.</p> <p>Gaslighting is real and dangerous, primarily about dominance and control, and can happen to anyone. That\u2019s why the term has proved to be invaluable \u2013 educating and empowering women to trust their instincts about any abusive situation where their sense of judgment has been crumbled up like a stock cube.</p> <p>We need to guard against overusing and cheapening this valuable term, though popular culture has seized it so decisively that sometimes it seems as if there\u2019s a national gaslighting epidemic. Increasingly, the term is applied inappropriately to all manner of situations (romantic, social, political). This phenomenon extends even beyond a programme such as <em>Love Island</em>, where male contestants are routinely denounced as \u201cgaslighters!\u201d, when at least some of them are just regular boorish players who\u2019d say anything to get laid.</p> <p>It serves us to remember that gaslighting is a specific form of structured abuse. It\u2019s not a convenient umbrella term for all mendacious or unpleasant behaviour; it isn\u2019t gaslighting every single time someone lies, or makes excuses. Put simply, all gaslighters are lying creeps, but not every lying creep is a gaslighter.</p> <p>Now there\u2019s a problem with the term gaslighting being over-popularised and spread too thinly, although I acknowledge that the far bigger problem is when gaslighting exists and is not named. Certainly, it\u2019s crucial to believe and support people who\u2019ve fallen prey, not least because they\u2019ve been robbed of the ability to trust themselves.</p> <p>Still, it can\u2019t help real victims to have the term overworked and thus degraded. As gaslighting increasingly becomes part of the popular vocabulary, perhaps we need to be a little careful and protective of it. It\u2019s not just another buzzword, it\u2019s a powerful term that heals and validates people, like Rebecca Humphries, when they need it most. For the term to continue to help women, it needs to retain its potency.</p> <h2>Kyrgios should leave the temper tantrums to better players<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"35ad65c90d118f71c08eb988dc328db5483dead7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35ad65c90d118f71c08eb988dc328db5483dead7/0_319_4720_2833/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Kyrgios in his game at Wimbledon against Rafael Nadal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nick Kyrgios in his game at Wimbledon against Rafael Nadal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaun Brooks/Action Plus via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What\u2019s the difference between being a \u201cbad-boy character\u201d and immature and rude? The Australian tennis player Nick Kyrgios <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/04/nick-kyrgios-unusual-prematch-prep-rafael-nadal-defeat\" title=\"\">went out boozing</a> in my manor, Wimbledon, the night before he played Rafael Nadal in the tournament. Kyrgios lost the match, but, as is his habit, won in terms of attention. He whinged about Nadal\u2019s timing, served underarm, spat on the turf, slated the umpire (accusing him of being power-crazed up in his chair) and hit the ball straight at Nadal\u2019s chest (Nadal deflected it with his racket).</p> <p>Later, Kyrgios <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/04/rafael-nadal-nick-kyrgios-underarm-ace-wimbledon\" title=\"\">admitted</a> that he had meant to hit the ball straight at Nadal and refused to apologise, saying: \u201cThat dude has got how many slams, and how much money in the bank account?\u201d As well as bragging about not training properly, Kyrgios also likes to complain about media criticism. Really? If anything, Kyrgios seems rather over-indulged.</p> <p>Although now ranked 43 in the world, Kyrgios is clearly gifted and has beaten the likes of Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic. Nor is he without wit or charm, but that doesn\u2019t make his rudeness any less grotty. For one thing, the umpires he berates are merely doing their job \u2013 it\u2019s as uncool to shout abuse at them as it is to be rude to waiters.</p> <p>As for boasting about not training enough, Kyrgios is now approaching his mid-twenties \u2013 if he doesn\u2019t concentrate on his game now, he\u2019s likely to end up as one of the sport\u2019s forgotten men. As his critic and admirer John McEnroe could tell him, it\u2019s one thing to be the \u201cbad boy of tennis\u201d but you\u2019d better be damn good at the sport first \u2013 in fact, you\u2019d better excel, and continue to do so.</p> <p>Is Kyrgios too chicken to show how much he cares? Right now, it seems that he\u2019d rather take the easy option of behaving like a brat without backing it up. How many slams, Nick?</p> <h2>We haven\u2019t paid for every morsel of Harry and Meghan\u2019s lives<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd7245c360d00c39cf7c87df931738352875e7c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd7245c360d00c39cf7c87df931738352875e7c4/364_177_2765_1659/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Meghan and Harry with Archie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Meghan and Harry with Archie: \u2018Are the couple to be allowed nothing of their own?\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are being criticised for <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/meghan-markle-prince-harry-share-17385455\" title=\"\">keeping the identities</a> of their son Archie\u2019s godparents a secret.</p> <p>Many people feel that, as the couple receive money from the civic purse, they have no right to withhold such information.

I\u2019d have thought it related to undertaking public duties as active representatives of the royal family. Few could deny that the couple more than fulfil this brief, and appear to be constantly working as part of the Firm.</p> <p>However, what\u2019s this got to do with being pressured to divulge every detail of family life? It would be amusing to think that Harry and Meghan are trolling certain sectors of the media, by withholding the information.

It serves us to remember that gaslighting is a specific form of structured abuse. It\u2019s not a convenient umbrella term for all mendacious or unpleasant behaviour; it isn\u2019t gaslighting every single time someone lies, or makes excuses. Put simply, all gaslighters are lying creeps, but not every lying creep is a gaslighter. Now there\u2019s a problem with the term gaslighting being over-popularised and spread too thinly, although I acknowledge that the far bigger problem is when gaslighting exists and is not named. Certainly, it\u2019s crucial to believe and support people who\u2019ve fallen prey, not least because they\u2019ve been robbed of the ability to trust themselves. Still, it can\u2019t help real victims to have the term overworked and thus degraded. As gaslighting increasingly becomes part of the popular vocabulary, perhaps we need to be a little careful and protective of it. It\u2019s not just another buzzword, it\u2019s a powerful term that heals and validates people, like Rebecca Humphries, when they need it most. For the term to continue to help women, it needs to retain its potency. Kyrgios should leave the temper tantrums to better players What\u2019s the difference between being a \u201cbad-boy character\u201d and immature and rude? The Australian tennis player Nick Kyrgios went out boozing in my manor, Wimbledon, the night before he played Rafael Nadal in the tournament. Kyrgios lost the match, but, as is his habit, won in terms of attention. He whinged about Nadal\u2019s timing, served underarm, spat on the turf, slated the umpire (accusing him of being power-crazed up in his chair) and hit the ball straight at Nadal\u2019s chest (Nadal deflected it with his racket). Later, Kyrgios admitted that he had meant to hit the ball straight at Nadal and refused to apologise, saying: \u201cThat dude has got how many slams, and how much money in the bank account?\u201d As well as bragging about not training properly, Kyrgios also likes to complain about media criticism. Really? If anything, Kyrgios seems rather over-indulged. Although now ranked 43 in the world, Kyrgios is clearly gifted and has beaten the likes of Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic. Nor is he without wit or charm, but that doesn\u2019t make his rudeness any less grotty. For one thing, the umpires he berates are merely doing their job \u2013 it\u2019s as uncool to shout abuse at them as it is to be rude to waiters. As for boasting about not training enough, Kyrgios is now approaching his mid-twenties \u2013 if he doesn\u2019t concentrate on his game now, he\u2019s likely to end up as one of the sport\u2019s forgotten men. As his critic and admirer John McEnroe could tell him, it\u2019s one thing to be the \u201cbad boy of tennis\u201d but you\u2019d better be damn good at the sport first \u2013 in fact, you\u2019d better excel, and continue to do so. Is Kyrgios too chicken to show how much he cares? Right now, it seems that he\u2019d rather take the easy option of behaving like a brat without backing it up. How many slams, Nick? We haven\u2019t paid for every morsel of Harry and Meghan\u2019s lives Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are being criticised for keeping the identities of their son Archie\u2019s godparents a secret. Many people feel that, as the couple receive money from the civic purse, they have no right to withhold such information. Sure, Harry and Meghan probably should have given up this information \u2013 concealing it is only going to make the story bigger. Other than that, why should they feel at all obliged? What exactly do people think they\u2019re buying with the money we give the royals? I\u2019d have thought it related to undertaking public duties as active representatives of the royal family. Few could deny that the couple more than fulfil this brief, and appear to be constantly working as part of the Firm. However, what\u2019s this got to do with being pressured to divulge every detail of family life? It would be amusing to think that Harry and Meghan are trolling certain sectors of the media, by withholding the information. However, considering the sustained hostility that Markle has endured, perhaps she in particular is just feeling over-protective about anything to do with her child. Are the couple to be allowed nothing of their own? Of course royals such as Harry and Meghan \u201cowe us\u201d when they receive money from the public purse, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ve sold their souls. \u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist",

This view quickly translated into higher stock market values and a marked downward shift in projected interest rates.</p> <p>The broader economic difficulties confronting Lagarde are, in the minds of traders, easily solved. Just cut the interest rate or pump extra electronic money into the financial system via quantitative easing, which has the same effect, and confidence will return. With more money around to borrow cheaply, economies will spring back to life.</p> <p>Easy money can help mitigate the costs of excessive government, corporate and household borrowing. And for that reason it shouldn\u2019t be dismissed as a tool to support economic growth.</p> <p>It is not the whole story, though. There are three major forces upsetting the economic apple cart at the moment. And all of them should tell Lagarde the job will turn sour.</p> <p>The first comes courtesy of the disruption suffered by individual industries as a result of new technology. The second is the hit to global trade from Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs. And third is the savings glut that can mostly be traced to baby boomers in the developed world, China\u2019s middle class and the oil-rich states and which means there is more money sloshing around the international system than viable things to invest in.</p> <p>If we examine these issues in order, it has become increasingly apparent that the shift to digital technologies since the early part of the century began to hollow out key blue- and white-collar industries.</p> <p>This trend can be most clearly seen in the US, though its effects have also struck at the heart of the European jobs market. The disappearance of millions of administrative posts across the developed world alongside factory jobs facing increasing automation has depressed wages and reduced household spending power.</p> <p>The 2008 banking crash came along to knock what stuffing there was out of the average worker, who has barely had the courage to ask for a pay rise since.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88ce9b47206cda194f816528aae6fc82000eed59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88ce9b47206cda194f816528aae6fc82000eed59/0_65_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Financial market traders are keen to know Lagarde\u2019s attitude towards interest rates.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UPI/Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/02/donald-trump-new-tariffs-eu-cheese-whisky-aircraft-subsidies\" title=\"\">Trump\u2019s tariffs</a> were dismissed last year as a reason to be gloomy by economists who did the maths to calculate how much global trade would be affected \u2013 1.5% at most. But as so often when discussing financial markets, economists who myopically stare at their models without understanding the outside world failed to factor in the chilling effect of even a minor trade war.</p> <p>Exuberance and panic are the City trader\u2019s watchwords and they are usually in one emotional state or the other. The promise of ever-lower borrowing costs has acted like a sugar rush for years now. Yet it\u2019s not clear that cheap loans can continue to overcome falling Chinese and German manufacturing output, and weakening business and consumer confidence in Europe, even if the US keeps sailing along.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2019/jul/04/george-osborne-must-understand-the-imf-role-is-no-popularity-contest\">George Osborne must understand the IMF role is no popularity contest | Nils Pratley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then there is the savings glut. Part of the financial markets\u2019 noticeable exuberance is based on the constant flood of pension and petro-dollar savings into the system. For the next 10 to 15 years, baby boomers will be squirrelling away vast sums for their retirements before almost all of them begin drawing on this mountain of money.</p> <p>This surplus, which is increasingly invested in the bond market and offered as loans, is the main reason international finance is a borrower\u2019s market and interest rates are kept low.</p> <p>While boomers and Saudi sheikhs are trying to find a home for their funds, interest rates will stay low. It\u2019s an iron law the US Federal Reserve tried to buck and is now being forced to backtrack on. US rates could start to come down as early as this month.

      "bodyText": "Welcome to Frankfurt, Christine Lagarde. A new job as head of the European Central Bank awaits. There are only so many supranational jobs on the political and economic circuit and you have nabbed a second one after seven years at the helm of the International Monetary Fund. There is much work to be done, not least the task of rescuing a eurozone economy that has seen four years of steady growth across most parts of its 19-member currency bloc start to evaporate. How the former French finance minister and corporate lawyer squares up to the challenge of boosting growth across such a large and disparate economy will be closely watched by the financial markets. The question the market traders ask is a simple one that centres on the ECB boss\u2019s attitude to interest rates and whether she will argue for the already low rates, ones that are so low they are negative, to be cut even further. Following Lagarde\u2019s nomination last week in a flurry of announcements concerning the top jobs in the EU, the expectation was that she would be in favour of cheaper borrowing when she takes over from Mario Draghi in November. This view quickly translated into higher stock market values and a marked downward shift in projected interest rates. The broader economic difficulties confronting Lagarde are, in the minds of traders, easily solved. Just cut the interest rate or pump extra electronic money into the financial system via quantitative easing, which has the same effect, and confidence will return. With more money around to borrow cheaply, economies will spring back to life. Easy money can help mitigate the costs of excessive government, corporate and household borrowing. And for that reason it shouldn\u2019t be dismissed as a tool to support economic growth. It is not the whole story, though. There are three major forces upsetting the economic apple cart at the moment. And all of them should tell Lagarde the job will turn sour. The first comes courtesy of the disruption suffered by individual industries as a result of new technology. The second is the hit to global trade from Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs. And third is the savings glut that can mostly be traced to baby boomers in the developed world, China\u2019s middle class and the oil-rich states and which means there is more money sloshing around the international system than viable things to invest in. If we examine these issues in order, it has become increasingly apparent that the shift to digital technologies since the early part of the century began to hollow out key blue- and white-collar industries. This trend can be most clearly seen in the US, though its effects have also struck at the heart of the European jobs market. The disappearance of millions of administrative posts across the developed world alongside factory jobs facing increasing automation has depressed wages and reduced household spending power. The 2008 banking crash came along to knock what stuffing there was out of the average worker, who has barely had the courage to ask for a pay rise since. Trump\u2019s tariffs were dismissed last year as a reason to be gloomy by economists who did the maths to calculate how much global trade would be affected \u2013 1.5% at most. But as so often when discussing financial markets, economists who myopically stare at their models without understanding the outside world failed to factor in the chilling effect of even a minor trade war. Exuberance and panic are the City trader\u2019s watchwords and they are usually in one emotional state or the other. The promise of ever-lower borrowing costs has acted like a sugar rush for years now. Yet it\u2019s not clear that cheap loans can continue to overcome falling Chinese and German manufacturing output, and weakening business and consumer confidence in Europe, even if the US keeps sailing along. Then there is the savings glut. Part of the financial markets\u2019 noticeable exuberance is based on the constant flood of pension and petro-dollar savings into the system. For the next 10 to 15 years, baby boomers will be squirrelling away vast sums for their retirements before almost all of them begin drawing on this mountain of money. This surplus, which is increasingly invested in the bond market and offered as loans, is the main reason international finance is a borrower\u2019s market and interest rates are kept low. While boomers and Saudi sheikhs are trying to find a home for their funds, interest rates will stay low. It\u2019s an iron law the US Federal Reserve tried to buck and is now being forced to backtrack on. US rates could start to come down as early as this month. Like the Fed, Lagarde cannot hope to overcome major economic trends with cheap money. It just won\u2019t work.",

And both countries have managed it before. The Swedes finished third in the very first World Cup, back in 1991, thrashing Germany 4-0; they did it again in 2011, besting France 2-1. And England finished third last time round, beating Germany 1-0 in Canada four years ago.</p> <p><strong>But here\u2019s some new ground: this is the first time England and Sweden have met at a World Cup.</strong> The teams have met on 25 other occasions, England winning just three matches. Sweden have 14 wins in the bag, the latest an easy 2-0 friendly victory in Rotherham last year. It\u2019s fair to say they\u2019ve got the upper hand in this particular head-to-head. </p> <p><strong>Still, both teams have lit up France this summer, so both will fancy their chances of a bittersweet valedictory win this afternoon in Nice. </strong>There\u2019s also the sideshow of Karen Carney\u2019s 144th and final cap for England, and Ellen White\u2019s bid to pip Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe to the golden boot. (They\u2019re currently on six, six and five goals respectively.) So this promises to be a cracker. Especially as the third-place play-off averages 2.71 goals per game. It\u2019s on!</p> <p><strong>Kick off: </strong>4pm BST, 5pm at the Stade de Nice.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "And so England\u2019s 2019 World Cup campaign comes to a painful end. Sweden once again put them to the sword - that\u2019s 15 wins in 26 meetings now - though England will point to a contentious VAR decision that they\u2019ll argue cost them bronze and also, perhaps, Ellen White the golden boot. But you can see how it was given handball. Louise Taylor was at the Stade de Nice to see hopes of bronze slip away. Her report is below. All that\u2019s left is to offer congratulations to Sweden and commiserations to England, and to thank you for reading this MBM. To Lyon, then, for tomorrow\u2019s final! Post-match postbag. \u201cDefinitely a game of two halves with Sweden absorbing a lot of pressure in the second half. Unfortunately for England all that possession only provided four shots on target out of 13 attempts. Comparatively, Sweden had eight on target out of nine. And despite the best efforts from some on social media, that shot to shots on target ratio cannot be blamed on the referee\u201d - Clare Lawrence \u201cEllen White\u2019s \u2018goal\u2019 was not clearly hand ball: VAR wasn\u2019t able to show it from the only angle that might prove it. On that basis it should never have been referred. Once it was, the referee had absolutely no evidence to change her original decision. That said, England were clueless on how to break down a tight defence\u201d - Martin York \u201cOnce again, England were punished for another slow start. Game effort in their comeback attempt but all for nought\u201d - Mary Waltz A downbeat Phil Neville speaks. \u201cI think maybe there was a carry-on from the semi-final, that emotion. The two goals probably sparked us into a bit of life, and after that, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen us play better. Their courage to keep going forward, their energy at the end ... most teams would have been on their knees. They gave everything. We gave it our best shot, we fell short, and next time we have to be better. It is really difficult to get yourself up for third-place games. Well done Sweden, but it\u2019s a nonsense game. We came at this tournament to win it, not to finish fourth. The players have delivered everything I wanted, but we\u2019ve got 15, 20 percent to go. That\u2019s sport. Many a champion has had to suffer before they get what they deserve. But I\u2019m immensely proud. We dissect, we debrief and get back on the horse again. Thank you for your support.\u201d Fran Kirby looks beyond gutted. She was excellent today. But it was an off-day for most of her team-mates. They all gather in a circle, as Phil Neville addresses his dejected troops. He\u2019ll be pointing out that, while defeat stings right now, they\u2019ll soon look back on this campaign with pride. It wasn\u2019t the epochal victory they so desperately desired ... but fourth place at a World Cup is never to be sniffed at. They\u2019re a fine side. It\u2019s just that the USA, the Netherlands and Sweden are that little bit better. And that\u2019s it! Sweden end the 2019 World Cup in third place, with the bronze medal. England pushed them hard in that second half, but the Swedes were the better side overall. Phil Neville\u2019s disappointed side fall to the turf as one, as do Sweden, in a massive celebratory pile-on. 90 min +4: Moore is booked for bringing down Blackstenius, breaking clear on the halfway line. It should probably be a red card, and the ref does initially brandish it, but then changes her mind. No point. Look at the time. Yellow. 90 min +3: Daly crosses into the Swedish box from the right. For once Lindahl can\u2019t claim. The ball drops to Greenwood, who can\u2019t control. The ball sails into the crowd behind. Greenwood drops her head, dejected. That could have been England\u2019s last chance, albeit a very difficult one. 90 min +1: Carney has a look from 25 yards. Easy for Lindahl. Sweden flood up the other end, where Zigiotti really should score. She\u2019s free just inside the box, but slips, then gathers herself, and shoots straight at Telford. Mighty fine save, but she should never have been allowed to make it. 90 min: A sensational clearance! This has to be seen to be believed! A corner for England on the right leads to a second. And from that, Bronze pearls a shot from the penalty shot goalwards. It\u2019s beaten Lindahl and it\u2019s travelling. But Fischer is on the line, and she stands firm to head the ball straight back upfield. That was outstanding. There will be four additional minutes. 88 min: England are taking risks now, piling everyone forward. That leaves space for Jakobsson, who should tear clear down the inside right but is visibly tiring and sends a weak shot straight at Telford. 87 min: Moore threads a through ball down the left to nobody. Lindahl claims. The clock ticks on. 86 min: Bronze, out on the right, sends a dangerous cross towards the far post. Taylor\u2019s waiting for it, but Lindahl catches spectacularly. That\u2019s immense keeping in the circumstances. What a claim! 84 min: Bronze makes another pointless foul, dragging down Hurtig, who had no escape route near her own left-hand corner flag. Free kick. Lindahl is booked for taking her own sweet time over it. 83 min: Moore has another crack from distance. It\u2019s no good. England make their last switch, throwing on Daly in place of McManus. 81 min: Carney drives down the left, released by Greenwood. She fizzes a low cross towards White and Taylor, who are right next to each other. But the ball breaks to neither of them. White tries to spin and shoot from the left-hand corner of the six-yard box, but can only scoop the ball out of play for a goal kick. 79 min: Fischer dawdles on the ball and is robbed by Taylor, who races off down the left. The ball\u2019s swung to the far post, and Eriksson isn\u2019t quite sure how to deal with the situation. She\u2019s very fortunate to be shoved pointlessly in the back by Bronze, as she was shanking the ball out for a corner. Instead, it\u2019s a free kick, and a chance for Sweden to run down the clock a little. 78 min: England ping it around the middle of the park to little effect. Sterile domination. 76 min: Glas swerves with great panache, in from the right, and very nearly works the space for a shot from the edge of the box. England hold firm. 74 min: Here comes Karen Carney, for the 144th and final time. She takes the place of Parris. 73 min: Scott isn\u2019t too far from releasing White down the middle, but there\u2019s a little too much juice on the pass. Lindahl gathers. 72 min: It\u2019s all become a little bitty. Sweden will be more than happy with this state of affairs, the clock very much their friend right now. 70 min: Ilestedt comes on for Bjorn. 68 min: Bjorn is down getting a little treatment. 66 min: Bronze is brushed off the ball in midfield and suddenly Sweden are three on three. Bjorn drives forward and lays off to Zigiotti, whose low shot is smothered by Telford. 64 min: A long pass down the inside-right channel nearly finds Taylor, but the ever-adventurous Lindahl comes out of her box to chest clear. 63 min: Kirby slips out of a tight spot out on the left and rolls a pass down the wing for Taylor, who skedaddles clear, enters the box, and curls a shot off the bottom of the right-hand post and out for a goal kick. She was well offside, though. Sweden had stopped, and the lino had put her flag up. But what excellent set-up play by Kirby, who slithered away from a couple of challenges with elegant ease. 62 min: ... Houghton heads harmlessly over the bar when meeting the ball at the near post. That was a decent opportunity, she\u2019ll be disappointed not to have done better. 61 min: Greenwood swings in a cross from the left. Sembrant half-clears under pressure from White. Bronze picks up possession on the right, and forces a corner, England\u2019s second of the match. And from that ... 59 min: England continue to probe, to ask questions. The ever-excellent Scott plays a cute reverse pass from a tight position out left to release Greenwood along the byline. Greenwood can\u2019t get a meaningful shot away, and Lindahl is once again on the spot to mop up. 58 min: Kirby has been England\u2019s best player so far. She dribbles with purpose down the right and sends a cross-cum-shot towards the near post. Lindahl does well to gather under pressure in a crowded area. 57 min: Kirby, playmaking from a deep pocket, spins and nearly releases White down the left. Glas does very well to put a stop to her gallop. Scott then has a clack from distance; Fischer blocks. This isn\u2019t quite the rollercoaster of the first half, but it\u2019s still open and entertaining. And on that topic, here\u2019s the latest missive from this MBM\u2019s co-author Mary Waltz: \u201cWhat a tonic these women are giving us, to give us respite from the sludge of the real world for at least 90 minutes. I for one am grateful.\u201d 56 min: So having said that, it\u2019s a free kick for the Swedes out on the right. They load the England box. Sembrant nudges Houghton in the back and it\u2019s a pressure-releasing free kick. But Sweden are quickly coming back at England, Jakobsson taking on Greenwood yet again. This time, however, Greenwood stands strong and brushes her opponent into touch. Goal kick. Fine defending. 54 min: England have looked the sharper side since the restart. All hail the magical powers of Phil\u2019s Special Half-Time Box. I wonder if this music plays when you open it? 52 min: Scott caresses a fine pass down the left and nearly releases Taylor. Lindahl comes racing from her box to intercept ... then misses. Fortunately for the keeper, hysterically sliding across the turf, a surprised Taylor can\u2019t control and Fischer is able to guide the ball away from danger. 50 min: Moore has a blast from distance. It\u2019s always heading left of the target, but that was flying. 49 min: England make their first sub. Taylor comes on for Mead. 47 min: A nice end-to-end start to this second half. Both teams going for it. Nobody thinking about extra time. Just before the restart, Phil Neville told the BBC that his team have \u201cput that first 20 minutes in a box in the dressing room\u201d. He\u2019s going to make a fine motivational speaker one day. And we\u2019re off again! Sweden have made a second change. Kosovare Asllani, who took that knock late on against the Netherlands, is replaced by 21-year-old striker Julia Zigiotti. Half-time entertainment. And there\u2019s the half-time whistle. England could easily be losing heavily, they could easily be level, they could easily be winning. One of those matches. It\u2019s been magnificent entertainment. More soon! 45 min +6: Parris races at the Swedish back line. She slips the ball down the inside-right channel for White, who is one on one with Lindahl! White pokes unconvincingly towards the bottom right; the keeper sticks out a leg and hacks clear. England so close to going in on terms! 45 min +4: Houghton attempts to chest the ball back to Telford, who doesn\u2019t come to claim. Blackstenius nips in between and wedges an instinctive effort over the keeper ... and just over the bar. There\u2019s a VAR check for a potential penalty, the ball having brushed Houghton\u2019s shoulder, but that would have been beyond ridiculous. We play on. 45 min +3: Bronze and Parris combine well down the right, the latter reaching the byline and clipping a cross into the centre. Lindahl claims easily enough. 45 min +2: Mead gets a little treatment after coming off second best in a 50-50 challenge with Sembrant. An opportunity for the players to take on some more water. It\u2019s blistering hot in Nice. 45 min: There will be five additional minutes of this first half. 44 min: Moore has a frustrated kick at Asllani, and is fairly fortunate not to go into the referee\u2019s notebook. It is a free kick, though, and one which results in Jakobsson sending a tame effort towards Telford from distance. 43 min: Jakobsson has Greenwood on toast. She swans past her on the right again, only to send her cross out of play for a goal kick. England have worked their way back into this match, but they still need to sort this out. 42 min: But England are awarded a free kick out on the left. However it ends in farce. Mead takes a cheeky one, before the whistle is blown. The ball sails harmlessly through to Lindahl, as everyone else was waiting on the referee to restart the game. The referee simply waves play on. Very strange. 40 min: Kirby cuts in from the left and rakes a lovely crossfield ball towards Parris, who kills the ball stone dead and fizzes a low cross into the mixer. Kirby, now in the box, claims she\u2019s been shoved in the back by Jakobsson, but neither the ref nor VAR are interested. 39 min: Asllani belts a clearance straight down the park. Blackstenius, who has been quiet by her own standards, nearly powers her way past McManus, but the stand-in central defender does extremely well to stand her ground and see off the striker. \u201cHarsh VAR ruling,\u201d argues Mary Waltz. \u201cBite the bullet and keep the pressure on, attack, attack, attack!\u201d 37 min: Scott swings a free kick into the Swedish box from the left. Lindahl claims easily enough. Small mercies for England: at least they have some momentum now, and have given Sweden something to think about. 35 min: But it\u2019s been disallowed. When White span around Sembrant down the inside-left channel, the ball reared up on her right arm. And so for the second match in a row, White has a goal ruled out by VAR. White is incensed, saying she couldn\u2019t do anything about it. But that\u2019s the call. And in a flash, England are level! Mead crosses from a deep position on the left. White brings the ball down, back to goal, spins Sembrant and prods past Lindahl and into the net! Here\u2019s that inspiration! Scott draws a couple of players in the midfield and slips Kirby away down the right. Kirby\u2019s been in a no-nonsense mood from the get-go, and here she drives towards the Swedish box, cuts in from the right, and sends a precision curler across Lindahl and into the bottom left. What a finish! 30 min: A long ball that White can\u2019t get her head on. England need some inspiration here. 28 min: A tearful Rolfo is replaced by Hurtig. Then England should really reduce the deficit, Parris entering the box from the right in a lot of space. She should shoot, but lays off to Kirby on her left. Kirby should have a go as well, but shuttles the ball further left to Mead, who shanks a shot across the face of goal. Fischer blocks and Lindahl claims, and the flag goes up for offside anyway. England over-elaborated there. They should be back in it. 26 min: The players get moving again. Sweden are down to ten women, with Rolfo off the field receiving treatment. 25 min: A cooling break. Time to take some water on board. And perhaps to have a bit of a tactical rethink. England are getting ripped apart here. 24 min: England try to strike back quickly. Kirby goes on another power run down the middle of the park, then Bronze has a shot from distance that\u2019s heading into the bottom corner before it\u2019s tipped around the post by Lindahl. The corner comes to nothing. They\u2019ll have to get going up front now, because they\u2019re two behind. Jakobsson has been running riot down the right, but here she pops up on the left, taking up a cut-back from Blackstenius near the corner flag. Jakobsson strides into the area, and curves a glorious shot across Telford and into the bottom right! That was simply unstoppable, one of those finishes that has you up out of your seat, shouting in awe. A peach of a finish. 21 min: A little bit of space for Parris out on the right. She rolls a diagonal pass into the Swedish box in the hope of finding White, cutting in from the other side. But Lindahl is all over it. England are doing very little in attack. 19 min: Now Sweden have a free kick out on the left. England can calm things down when Asllani hangs the set piece too high, an easy pick for Telford. On the touchline, Phil Neville has the good grace to look highly concerned. 18 min: Sweden are in total control here. The ball keeps coming back at England, usually down the right. Jakobsson once again tears into space and whips a vicious cross towards Asllani, who would surely have battered home from ten yards had Bronze not nipped in to flick the ball away from danger. That\u2019s fine defending. But it\u2019s last-ditch defending, and England are struggling here. 17 min: The corner\u2019s hoicked into the mixer and causes all manner of panic in the England six-yard box. The referee blows for a foul on Telford, much to England\u2019s relief. 16 min: England are so fortunate it\u2019s still just 1-0. A simple long pass down the right sends Jakobsson free. She drifts into the box and pearls a shot towards the bottom right. The ball cannons off the base of the post, onto the back of Telford, diving despairingly, and nearly ricochets into the net. Inches wide. A corner. 14 min: Eriksson nearly concedes a corner with a ludicrously overhit backpass, but Lindahl does extremely well to scamper after it and stop the ball dead on the line, before launching a quick counter attack. Jakobsson nearly gets past Greenwood, who is being repeatedly targeted by the Swedes down this right flank. Not this time. But every time Sweden go down that side, they look very dangerous. 13 min: That was dreadful defending. Houghton was on the touchline gesticulating, arms out wide, asking why she couldn\u2019t run back on. But she\u2019d have not made it back to her position in time anyway, so the point is moot. Rolfo crosses from the left. There\u2019s a big Houghton-shaped gap in the centre of the England defence. Greenwood tries to thump clear, but only succeeds in cushioning the ball down for Asllani, who under no pressure whatsoever, whacks a shot into the bottom right from ten yards. 10 min: Houghton is down receiving attention. She\u2019s holding her right ear, perhaps having taken a whack on the noggin. A frown, a tablet and a swig of some blue isotonic beverage. She trots off and waits to be allowed back on. And while she waits ... 8 min: Asllani, thankfully fully recovered after that worrying knock towards the end of the semi-final against the Netherlands, feeds Rolfo down the left. Rolfo reaches the byline and whips in a low cross that Houghton does well to nick clear. 6 min: A nice open feel to this match. England are indeed set out in a 4-3-3. 4 min: Telford faffs around with the ball at her feet, and is very nearly closed down by a rampaging Blackstenius. A crisp turn in the six-yard box gets the keeper out of trouble, but that was so, so close to an embarrassing mistake. Playing out from the back isn\u2019t as easy as Japan made it look. 3 min: From the corner, England stream upfield on the break. Kirby flies off on another lightning run, this time down the inside-left channel, and slips the ball wide for Mead, who looks to recreate England\u2019s goal against the USA by whipping a cross in for White. But Lindahl is down to smother before the ball can get through to England\u2019s six-goal sensation. 2 min: Sweden come straight back at England, though, Jakobsson driving down the right wing and nearly getting the better of Greenwood. She shoots from a tight angle, but Greenwood sticks to her guns and extends a leg, deflecting the striker over for a corner. And we\u2019re off! Straight from kick-off, Kirby runs directly at Sweden down the middle of the park. For a second things look like opening up, the Swedes slightly shocked at the brazen ambition of the dribble. But eventually Kirby\u2019s shepherded towards the right flank and the gambit comes to nothing. Some start to this match, though! The teams are out! Anthems are played and respected - Ann Widdecombe would be appalled - then hands are clasped in friendship and coins are tossed. We\u2019ll be off before you know it! \u201cPlease tell me that England will correct that brain cramp and return to a 4-3-3 and let Bronze and Parris roar down the right flank,\u201d writes Mary Waltz. Yes, our Phil has been guilty of overthinking things at times during this tournament, but you\u2019ll be pleased to hear he\u2019s gone back to basics and done exactly what you\u2019re after. Unless he\u2019s devised some new do-si-do spin on Total Football which will have changed the sport for ever more by 4.03pm, no going back ... I suppose we shouldn\u2019t assume anything. Phil Neville speaks. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to freshen up in certain areas. Certain players have earned the right to play. In the last couple of days, the players have been my motivation. They\u2019ve motivated me because they\u2019ve played in this game before, four years ago. They\u2019ve been giving me messages on how important it is to go home with a medal. Karen Carney has been one of the best, one of the pioneers, and she will 100 percent get on the field today. So too will Jodie Taylor, she\u2019s been immense in this campaign. The problem Jodie has had is Ellen White, who has been phenomenal. So they will definitely get on the field. A medal will mean we\u2019ve got something to show for the last 51 days we\u2019ve been away. Something Sue Campbell [the FA\u2019s director of women\u2019s football] said to me last night, is that even though it\u2019s a bronze, in certain colour of light it still looks like gold. So I\u2019m going to get a light at home that makes my bronze medal, hopefully, look like gold! We want to go home with another victory, and keep that feeling of winning.\u201d It\u2019s been a fantastic World Cup, so there\u2019s a celebratory mood in the Stade de Nice. Preach on, sister. Shirtwatch. Both teams will wear their first-choice gear this afternoon. England\u2019s Karen Carney will pull this elegant design on for the very last time ... ... while the Swedes run out in this fashionable asymmetric affair. It\u2019s nice in Nice. The mercury is nudging 30 degrees centigrade. It\u2019s partly cloudy, perfect conditions for swing bowling. There might also be a few clouds of hot steam parping out of the ears of several English and Swedish supporters, given the oaf in charge of the big screens at the Stade de Nice has just transmitted highlights of both semi-finals. We were aware, you know. England make four changes to their starting line-up. Millie Bright is suspended after seeing red in the semi-final against the USA, so is replaced in central defence by Abbie McManus. Alex Greenwood returns at left-back in place of Demi Stokes, while in midfield Fran Kirby and Jade Moore replace Rachel Daly and Keira Walsh. Sweden make two changes to their semi-final XI. Fridolina Rolfo returns from suspension, replacing Lina Hurtig up front, while Nathalie Bjorn comes in for Elin Rubensson on the right side of midfield. England: Telford, Bronze, Houghton, McManus, Greenwood, Kirby, Scott, Moore, Parris, White, Mead. Subs: Bardsley, Walsh, Taylor, Duggan, Stokes, Williamson, Daly, Stanway, Carney, Staniforth, Earps. Sweden: Lindahl, Glas, Fischer, Sembrant, Eriksson, Bjorn, Asllani, Seger, Jakobsson, Blackstenius, Rolfo. Subs: Faik, Andersson, Janogy, Hurtig, Ilestedt, Roddar, Zigiotti Olme, Anvegard, Larsson, Schough, Rubensson, Musovic. Referee: Anastasia Pustovoytova (Russia). It\u2019s been a heartbreaking week for these two fine teams. England\u2019s chance of appearing in their first World Cup final was snuffed out by the reigning champions USA on Tuesday evening; Sweden\u2019s hopes of making it to their second went south when the Netherlands pipped them during extra time 24 hours later. And so both sides were fated to contest the one match in which no footballer ever wants to play: the third-place play-off. Still, it would be nice to win, and take the edge off. Third place, the bronze-medal position, isn\u2019t so bad when the sting of coming so close to glory subsides. And both countries have managed it before. The Swedes finished third in the very first World Cup, back in 1991, thrashing Germany 4-0; they did it again in 2011, besting France 2-1. And England finished third last time round, beating Germany 1-0 in Canada four years ago. But here\u2019s some new ground: this is the first time England and Sweden have met at a World Cup. The teams have met on 25 other occasions, England winning just three matches. Sweden have 14 wins in the bag, the latest an easy 2-0 friendly victory in Rotherham last year. It\u2019s fair to say they\u2019ve got the upper hand in this particular head-to-head. Still, both teams have lit up France this summer, so both will fancy their chances of a bittersweet valedictory win this afternoon in Nice. There\u2019s also the sideshow of Karen Carney\u2019s 144th and final cap for England, and Ellen White\u2019s bid to pip Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe to the golden boot. (They\u2019re currently on six, six and five goals respectively.) So this promises to be a cracker. Especially as the third-place play-off averages 2.71 goals per game. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 4pm BST, 5pm at the Stade de Nice.",

      "bodyText": "Police chiefs and prosecutors have been accused of treating a coalition of women\u2019s groups with contempt after cancelling a meeting to discuss concerns over requests to hand over mobile phone records in rape investigations. The highly anticipated consultation was cancelled three hours before it was due to start on Friday afternoon after senior police officers and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) learned they were facing legal action over new consent forms introduced by police forces, authorising detectives to search the texts, images and call data of rape complainants. The Westminster event was promised following a national outcry and was meant to discuss urgent reform to the controversial policy announced in April. However, after legal charity Centre for Women\u2019s Justice launched a legal challenge last week calling the measures unlawful, the meeting was called off. In a letter notifying legal action sent on Thursday evening to the National Police Chief\u2019s Council (NPCC), the CPS and the College of Policing, lawyers demanded the policy be withdrawn because it was unlawful on grounds that such requests are disproportionate, discriminated against women and are incompatible with fundamental rights of privacy and protection of personal data. An email sent on Friday morning from the CPS explained the meeting had been postponed because of the legal action, which meant it was not \u201cappropriate to engage in a discussion today whilst we deal with our response\u201d. The new policy relies on forms that request formal consent for officers to comb through victims\u2019 digital devices and warn that if they refuse, \u201cit may not be possible for the investigation or prosecution to continue\u201d. Silkie Carlo, the director of Big Brother Watch, one of the 13 groups invited to the meeting, said: \u201cThere is a massive failure within our justice system and yet it seems the very people who are supposed to protect it are not willing to listen. \u201cWe\u2019ve told them our concerns before and we were prepared to explain them again today, but the doors have been shut in our faces.

      "body": "<p>The far right does not seize power. It is invited in to power by mainstream conservatives, who boast of their commitment to free societies. They do it for partisan gain. They do it because they hate and fear the left more than they hate and fear the far right. But most of all they do it because they have run out of ideas. The energy and the votes appear to lie with radical rather than \u201crespectable\u201d conservatives. The future is extreme, and, like prostitutes turning a trick, conservatives would rather lose their respectability than their chance of staying in the game.</p> <p>Leftish condemnations of \u201cneoliberalism\u201d miss that the Thatcher/Reagan ideology of the 1980s is over. Conservatives rarely admit it, in public at any rate, but an idea is still dead even if no one turns up for the funeral. Who can now pretend hopes that a small state and free markets would bring prosperity to the mass of people are anything more than a hollow joke? The 2010s have been the <a href=\"https://theferret.scot/ian-blackford-wage-growth-200-years/\" title=\"\">worst decade for wage growth in 200 years</a>. The real value of average wages has still not staggered back to its 2007 level. The web\u2019s enabling of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/18/what-is-fake-news-pizzagate\" title=\"\">fake news</a> gets all the attention. But if it had never been invented, there would still have been a reaction against the emptiness of the promises of the old ruling order.</p> <p>Put yourself in the place of the conservatives who thought Ronald Reagan\u2019s and Margaret Thatcher\u2019s certainties would sustain them. They have learned the lesson of the 2010s that fear beats hope. They have heard the audience cheer when they bash immigrants and the EU, and fall silent when they talk of compromise and tolerance. They wonder what would happen if its rage were directed at them rather than convenient scapegoats.</p> <p>Is an endorsement of a Trump, Salvini, Farage or Orb\u00e1n such a high price to pay in these circumstances? Traditional conservatives can mock them in private and drop careful hints in public that they come from an altogether classier version of conservatism. But when the choice has to be made, they will go with them rather than fight them. Better that than become a historical curiosity: the left-behind of rightwing politics.</p> <p>A Sicilian aristocrat in Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa\u2019s great novel, <em>The Leopard</em>, says: \u201cIf we want things to stay as they are, things will have to change.\u201d The line is trotted out when writers want to encapsulate how an old ruling class must adapt to survive the arrival of democracy, the rise of the middle class or the demands of the working class; in other words, how it must change to accommodate movements you can broadly describe as progressive. But radical shocks to the old order don\u2019t always come from \u201cthe left\u201d. Nor does the urge to destroy. Thatcherism, Islamism, Hindu, Christian and Jewish religious fanaticism and today\u2019s populism show that for the last 50 years the counter-revolution has outpaced the revolution more often than not.</p> <p><em>The Leopard</em> begins with Garibaldi\u2019s red shirts arriving in Sicily in 1860. Its final scene is set in 1910. In 1922, the Italian king Victor Emmanuel III refused to allow the military to stop Mussolini\u2019s forces marching on Rome and allowed him to take power instead. For things to stay the same, he realised the change the old Italian aristocracy had to endorse was the world\u2019s first fascist state. Lampedusa looked on with approval. \u201cEven if a revolution breaks out, no one will touch a hair on my head or steal one penny from me,\u201d he wrote in 1925, \u201cbecause by my side I have\u2026 Mussolini!\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Boris Johnson played with fire to become prime minister and must keep fanning the flames if he is to survive</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Times change but the survival instinct does not. The capitulations of conservatism are so commonplace we barely notice them. For the record, it is worth mentioning that the few principled conservatives left in the United States keep lists of their former friends who could not sustain their opposition to Donald Trump.</p> <p>What unites Senator Lindsey Graham, say, with Paul Ryan, and Rupert Murdoch\u2019s employees at Fox News is that, when it came to the moment of decision, all their talk about free trade and free markets, fiscal discipline and family values counted for nothing when set against the danger of alienating the new forces on the right.</p> <p>The autocracies in eastern Europe have flourished under the protection of Angela Merkel and the impeccably well-mannered conservatives in the <a href=\"https://www.aspenreview.com/article/2018/europes-pet-autocrats/\" title=\"\">European People\u2019s Party</a>.

      "bodyText": "The far right does not seize power. It is invited in to power by mainstream conservatives, who boast of their commitment to free societies. They do it for partisan gain. They do it because they hate and fear the left more than they hate and fear the far right. But most of all they do it because they have run out of ideas. The energy and the votes appear to lie with radical rather than \u201crespectable\u201d conservatives. The future is extreme, and, like prostitutes turning a trick, conservatives would rather lose their respectability than their chance of staying in the game. Leftish condemnations of \u201cneoliberalism\u201d miss that the Thatcher/Reagan ideology of the 1980s is over. Conservatives rarely admit it, in public at any rate, but an idea is still dead even if no one turns up for the funeral. Who can now pretend hopes that a small state and free markets would bring prosperity to the mass of people are anything more than a hollow joke? The 2010s have been the worst decade for wage growth in 200 years. The real value of average wages has still not staggered back to its 2007 level. The web\u2019s enabling of fake news gets all the attention. But if it had never been invented, there would still have been a reaction against the emptiness of the promises of the old ruling order. Put yourself in the place of the conservatives who thought Ronald Reagan\u2019s and Margaret Thatcher\u2019s certainties would sustain them. They have learned the lesson of the 2010s that fear beats hope. They have heard the audience cheer when they bash immigrants and the EU, and fall silent when they talk of compromise and tolerance. They wonder what would happen if its rage were directed at them rather than convenient scapegoats. Is an endorsement of a Trump, Salvini, Farage or Orb\u00e1n such a high price to pay in these circumstances? Traditional conservatives can mock them in private and drop careful hints in public that they come from an altogether classier version of conservatism. But when the choice has to be made, they will go with them rather than fight them. Better that than become a historical curiosity: the left-behind of rightwing politics. A Sicilian aristocrat in Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa\u2019s great novel, The Leopard, says: \u201cIf we want things to stay as they are, things will have to change.\u201d The line is trotted out when writers want to encapsulate how an old ruling class must adapt to survive the arrival of democracy, the rise of the middle class or the demands of the working class; in other words, how it must change to accommodate movements you can broadly describe as progressive. But radical shocks to the old order don\u2019t always come from \u201cthe left\u201d. Nor does the urge to destroy. Thatcherism, Islamism, Hindu, Christian and Jewish religious fanaticism and today\u2019s populism show that for the last 50 years the counter-revolution has outpaced the revolution more often than not. The Leopard begins with Garibaldi\u2019s red shirts arriving in Sicily in 1860. Its final scene is set in 1910. In 1922, the Italian king Victor Emmanuel III refused to allow the military to stop Mussolini\u2019s forces marching on Rome and allowed him to take power instead. For things to stay the same, he realised the change the old Italian aristocracy had to endorse was the world\u2019s first fascist state. Lampedusa looked on with approval. \u201cEven if a revolution breaks out, no one will touch a hair on my head or steal one penny from me,\u201d he wrote in 1925, \u201cbecause by my side I have\u2026 Mussolini!\u201d Times change but the survival instinct does not. The capitulations of conservatism are so commonplace we barely notice them. For the record, it is worth mentioning that the few principled conservatives left in the United States keep lists of their former friends who could not sustain their opposition to Donald Trump. What unites Senator Lindsey Graham, say, with Paul Ryan, and Rupert Murdoch\u2019s employees at Fox News is that, when it came to the moment of decision, all their talk about free trade and free markets, fiscal discipline and family values counted for nothing when set against the danger of alienating the new forces on the right. The autocracies in eastern Europe have flourished under the protection of Angela Merkel and the impeccably well-mannered conservatives in the European People\u2019s Party. Like Donald Trump, Viktor Orb\u00e1n is against everything they believe in \u2013 or say they believe in: a free press, independent judiciary, a free market where corruption has no place. Yet European conservatives protected Orb\u00e1n from sanctions. Nurtured by the respectable right, Europe\u2019s populist states celebrated their invitation to the high table by blocking the appointment of the Dutch diplomat Frans Timmermans as European commission president for fear he would force them to live by the democratic standards that conservatives pretend to share. In Britain we have the abject figures of George Osborne, Matt Hancock and Damian Green who know a no-deal Brexit is a disaster but are endorsing Boris Johnson because they want his patronage. Journalists who claim to understand Johnson say he is at heart a liberal. Assuming he has a heart, he may be, but his motives no longer matter. He played with fire to become prime minister, and must keep fanning the flames if he is to survive. Like many others, he found that the way to win was to direct hatred at the EU.

We go again, though there is many an absent friend not on this year\u2019s Tour. No Tom Dumoulin. No Chris Froome. No Mark Cavendish. And the Sky Train will have to be renamed the rather unwieldy Ineos Train. Still, there\u2019s always G, as in Geraint Thomas the defending champion. To call him a surprise winner last year is something of an understatement, and there is the possibility he will be on the end of a similar overturning of team orders as that which he performed last year with Froome. Egan Bernal hauled the dear, departed Sky Train over the mountains last season, burying himself in the process. With Froome having to become one of the oldest ever winners to make five Tours if he comes back next year - itself not guaranteed - and G 33 himself, the 22-year-old has time and talent on his side. <br><br>Who are the other contenders? This is a highly open field, with former winner Vincenzo Nibali perhaps fancying a, er, nibble, then there\u2019s Nairo Quintana, the coming force who never managed to get away far enough on the mountains.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s the snap report for stage one, with Jeremy Whittle\u2019s piece to follow later, including news of the walking wounded. Here\u2019s a glimpse of that crash, but it looks as though G has got off lightly. Far better than than Jakob Fuglsang and Dylan Groenewegen, of course. Thomas has form for falling. Or at least he used to. Good stats from the excellent Inner Ring again. Caleb Ewan also fell short at the finish. Viviani, given a decent lead-out by his Quickstep team, looks to have continued his indifferent form. Teunissen, the stage winner and the man now in yellow, has a few words just before he is presented with the jersey, a huge smile on his face. Eddy Merckx - who else? - hands over the maillot jaune. I cannot believe it. We were working for months for Dylan Groenewegen to win the stage. At 1.5k, he disappeared as he got caught up in the crash. I am still there and I am still fresh, I could see people dying and even catching up. Groenewegen went over his handlebars, and looked gutted. That was his chance of a yellow jersey gone. Instead, his teammate takes the jersey. It seems like Jakob Fuglsang might have even been caught up in it, after his earlier fall. How\u2019s your luck? Peter Sagan will end the day in green, and probably stay there. Here\u2019s some potted results. The Tour is the Tour and just as expected the day to be sedate there was a major crash - of which more later - and the shock of Sagan being beaten by someone who was supposed to be leading out for Dylan Groenewegen, who was lost in the carnage, one of the fallers. Here comes the sprint. Sagan looks comfortable, but there is a long way to go. Michael Matthews is at the front, and then Sagan hits the front. Did he get there? No! A surge from Mike Teunissen, usually a lead-out rider for Team Jumbo\u2013Visma takes the stage win in a photo finish. 2 km to go: Alaphilippe takes to the front to lead out Quickstep for Viviani, with Sagan boxed in. Oh, there\u2019s a crash, a big pile-up. Geraint\u2019s gone down! Oof, drama! 3 km to go: Britain\u2019s Alex Dowsett takes the lead for a while, leading his Katusha team out. Whose lead-out will be the best? With no Cav around, this is alien territory. 4 km to go: These are big, sweeping bends, and the speed is breakneck. 5 km to go: OK, here we go, a mix of trying to stay safe and risking all for the peloton. Sagan is lurking with intent, tucked in behind his team. 8 km to go: Brussels\u2019 boulevards look resplendent as the peloton powers through them. Rossetto has been swallowed up, and the day is set for a sprint, barring a wildcat breakaway. 10 km to go: The lead is 20 seconds. Well, at least Rossetto will get the award for most aggressive rider. He will soon be swallowed up by the pack. Fuglsang\u2019s knee is getting the magic spray. Looks like his race could be over before it had even begun. He\u2019s 34, too, and this was his year, in such rich form, too. 12 km to go: Rossetto is down to 40 seconds as a lead. The pack is speeding along. Damiano Caruso looks bashed up after that prang, and in a delicate, if fleshy place. Worryingly, Fuglsang is testing out his knee. 15 km to go: Quickstep are leading the group with Jumbo\u2013Visma. Tony Martin, though, is not with them, having got stuck in traffic. Jakob Fuglsang, one of those mentioned as a favourite, has blood spilling down his face, having got caught up in the tail end of that prang. His Astana teammates are around him, the winner of the Liege-Bastogne-Liege and the Criterium de Dauphin\u00e9 races. There\u2019s always one big rider who gets bashed up on the early stages. And there will probably be more. 18 km to go: The crowds are huge as the last 20km are entered, and there\u2019s been a fall in the field. It doesn\u2019t look too serious, and the four or five riders who came to a stop are all back on. Damiano Caruso of Bahrain-Merida was one of them. 22 km to go: Rossetto\u2019s lead is dwindling, and so we enter the phoney war where the teams try to get their ducks in a row for the sprint. The Mur and the Bosberg aside, it\u2019s not been particularly arduous out there. 25 km to go: How about this for a primer on the current leader, Stephane Rossetto. 30 km to go: Rossetto\u2019s lead is down a little, and taking under 1\u2019 30\u201d. This is his first ever day in the saddle on the Tour and he is clearly keen to make an impression. Brussels beckons, and the race is on the outskirts of the capital city. James Cavell on, well, Cav: \u201cI understand that fans are unhappy about Cavendish\u2019s non-selection but you\u2019d expect a man in the sort of form capable of contesting sprints in the Tour (and getting over the mountains) might have done rather better than 22nd in a sprinter- friendly British Championship a week before the Tour started. Winning that race would not only have demonstrated some form but also gained favour with selectors as national champion jerseys tend to be popular with sponsors in big races as they stand out.\u201d Jeremy Whittle\u2019s tour diary is here for your delight and delectation. All diaries must mention Love Island. The famous Belgian question no longer stops at Eddy Merckx and Herg\u00e9. Guy Hornsby emails in: \u201cAfternoon, John. I share the disbelief that Cav has been left out by Dimension Data. Yes, he had a difficult 2018, mostly explained by the Epstein-Barr virus, and he\u2019s no spring chicken, but he built his season towards the Tour, and so that\u2019s baffling enough until you include the absence of the team\u2019s main GC contender, and you have to ask, Cummings aside, what do they have instead? It an absolute mess, and as a huge fan of his, I\u2019m gutted here\u2019s not there for another tilt at 34 wins. A big loss to the race.\u201d They seem to think that Cummings, the breakaway genius but now 38, has a better chance of winning a stage. And there will be more to come on what happened behind the scenes. 45 km to go: We are in the vicinity of Waterloo as headline writers ready themselves for the fall of a major contender. Those dodgy roads may well fell a favourite. Can only assume the local highways agency has been sent to St Helena. 50 km to go: Plenty of doings at the back of the field as teams prepare themselves for the final 50 clicks. A few comfort breaks and domestiques piling back for supplies. The team cars are being busy. Julian Alaphilippe is among those heading back to get his food and bottles then motors after the pack. There is a lone breakaway from Stephane Rossetto, the Frenchman who performed a solo run at the Tour de Yorkshire last year and prevailed. It has to be said that the road is not in the best state. Rossetto has 1\u2019 42\u201d on the field. 65 km to go: There is gap of around 1\u2019 20\u201d between the two main groups in the field but with Bora\u2013Hansgrohe, Sagan\u2019s team, sitting up, it won\u2019t last long. It might, though, burn up some petrol ahead of the sprint at the finish. 68 km to go: First sprint of the day and Peter Sagan wins it, as expected. He took 20 points for that and was pretty much unchallenged as he took it, ahead of Sonny Colbrelli, Greg van Avermaet and Michael Matthews. Sagan could be in the green jersey from wire to wire here. He\u2019s heading for a record seventh, overtaking Erik Zabel in the process. 70 km to go: Les Bon Villers will be the scene of that intermediate sprint. There are splits in the field. Quickstep drop back to pull Viviani in. 72km to go: Here\u2019s some serious cobbles, and they are boneshaking stuff. Viviani, one of the favourites for the sprint later, give or take an indifferent season, is forced off his bike and has to be given a new one. There is an intermediate sprint ahead and the group\u2019s push for that has pulled in the breakaway. Alexander Kristoff, another sprinter, had a problem, too. It\u2019s worth mentioning that the women\u2019s Giro d\u2019Italia, the Giro Rosa, is being held at the moment. It runs from yesterday, Friday, to next Sunday. CL, our expert has very kindly emailed in to inform us of what happened on Stage Two. Giro Rosa stage 2, 6 July \u2013 78.3km hilly circuit, Vi\u00f9 Results: 1: Marianne Vos 2: Annemiek van Vleuten 3 : Lucinda Brand After a first breakaway by Anna Christoforou and Sofie de Vuyst, who hoovered up the day\u2019s QoM, and a second breakaway only caught late on, the last few kilometres featured several attacks before the stage was won by the magnificent Marianne Vos, followed by Annemiek van Vleuten and Lucinda Brand. Kasia Niewiadoma keeps the pink jersey. Thanks, CL. 83 km to go: Here\u2019s some more cobbles, and the sound of some creaking wheels. Remember five years ago, when Chris Froome fell off even before they reached the cobbles? He\u2019s an all-time great, but there has always been something of the Frank Spencer about him. Fred Atkins responds to Gareth Thomas. A major discussion point this week has been the absence of Mark Cavendish, who now looks likely to be stuck on 30 stage wins, and never to overtake Eddy Merckx\u2019s record of 34. That news escaped not long before the deadline for naming teams. As Jeremy Whittle, our reporter out at Le Tour says, his axing by Dimension Data has not been handled too well. Rolf Aldag, the sporting director, did start the stage today, by the way. 90 km to go: Not much happening right now so time to look back. This type of action looks a certainty for today\u2019s finish. 95 km to go: The three riders at the front are whipping along through the Walloon countryside. The gap is still two minutes or so. Back in the pack, those Ineos jerseys are to the fore. We might be getting used to that sight over the next three weeks. Gareth Thomas writes in from Spain: \u201cI\u2019m still not sure who to support this year, having been a Sky supporter for years. Like other British cycling fans I know here in Spain, I cannot support Brailsford\u2019s team any longer \u2013 advertising Ineos - due to environmental objections. I will be backing Movistar now. Some British exSky fans I know are not even watching the TDF this year. How much are you picking up on these concerns from cycling fans in France?\u201d It will be interesting to see how the public responds to the rebranded Team Sky; they were about as popular as Donald Trump in France last year. Ineos are certainly a source of controversy over here. 100 km to go: Bradley Wiggins looked a bit harried on the back of that motorbike, as they sped after the breakaway. He\u2019s more a scooter boy, what with him being a mod and into Paul Weller, the Merton Parkas, Ocean Colour Scene and the Blow Monkeys and all that. Unless you are lucky enough to head to L\u2019Hexagone to catch a bit of the race, then it\u2019s likely you will be watching this year\u2019s Tour from your desk or armchair, as Barry Glendenning captures here. Like him, I am a fan of Sean Kelly\u2019s minimalist style, phrases like \u201cTour of France\u201d and \u201cthe general classement\u201d delivered in that flat Waterford accent are the sounds of a mid-summer. David Millar\u2019s more mid-Atlantic, international baccalaur\u00e9at tones are also a winner in the UK. And, someone who will be missed by the worldwide crowd is Paul Sherwen, who died in December, and broke up decades of partnership with Phil Liggett. 110 km to go: A report that Simon Yates suffered a mechanical at the back of the peloton, just before the Mur, but he\u2019s back in the pack now. The source of that report: Stone Roses fan Bradley Wiggins, who is working as a roving reporter on the back of a motorbike. Richard Parker wants to know about Chris Froome: \u201cAny news on the Kenyan-born cyclist?\u201d Well, he has finally been allowed home after proving that blowing your nose on a windy day is probably not a good idea. 120 km to go: It\u2019s a leading trio now, with Van Avermaet having bounced himself back into the pack, and the gap is decreasing down to 1\u2019 30\u201d. He will have the polka dot jersey when the presentations are made later. Berhane, Wurz and Meuriise continue out front but not for long. 125 km to go: That gap is around 1\u2019 50\u201d, which suggests the peloton is not making much effort to chase down. Looks like being a pretty sedate stage, and a sprint almost guaranteed. Time, then, to consider the contenders, with Egan Bernal, though he is just 22, one of the most fancied. 135 km to go: The gap is closing down little by little, which suggest Van Avermaet and co will soon be done for the day. The two climbs were captured by two Belgians so that\u2019s mission accomplished for them. 145 km to go: The pav\u00e9 on the Bosberg looks treacherous, and Meurisse pips Van Avermaet at the top. The two Belgians had dropped the other two members of that breakaway quartet but Van Avermaet has dropped back. Again, the peloton ease up the climb, and we have a long wait until the next climb, at Les Bons Villers. 150 km to go: Van Avermaet wins on the Mur! Berhane goes off first, but is quickly reeled back in. Van Avermaet, hauls him back in, reels him back in. Berhane goes off the back and Mads W\u00fcrz, and Xando Meurisse push Van Avermaet all the way but, and as expected, he takes the two points. That was short, but sharp. The gap, by the way, has already dropped to 2\u2019 25\u201d, though the peloton is easing through Gramont. Now for the Bosberg. 152 km to go: The leading quartet are dropping into Gramont, which is teeming with fans as they begin the climb and hit the cobbles. Just under five kilometres until we get to the Mur, which is where the fun can begin. Bradley Wiggins can feel the earth begin to move, hear his needle hit the groove. Shaun Clapperton emails in: \u201cHi John, don\u2019t kick yourself for not mentioning Roberto Uran as a contender for Le Tour. Kick yourself for not mentioning Rigoberto Uran.\u201d I think I got all confused with Roberto Duran, hands of stone and all that. No mas. Now, what is the Anglicised version of Rigoberto/Rigobert? William Fotheringham, in his stage-by-stage guide, suggests the Mur is going to be little more than garnish. The Tour starts with a loop southwards through Flanders into Wallonia and back, with two cobbled climbs celebrated as part of the Ronde van Vlaanderen, the Muur van Geraardsbergen and the Bosberg, and one stretch of pav\u00e9 near Charleroi. These all come too early to have any serious impact so the peloton will be jostling for a bunch sprint as they tackle a finale that includes the towns of Waterloo \u2013 a gift for the headline writers \u2013 and Woluwe-Saint-Pierre, childhood home of Eddy Merckx. Sprint favourites will include Caleb Ewan and Andr\u00e9 Greipel. 170 km to go: We are 20 clicks or so from the Mur de Grammont, a steep, cobbled climb you may recognise from the Tour of Flanders. The gap is 3\u2019 15\u201d or so to the peloton, probably not enough to stay away from the Classics specialists. In Flemish, since you\u2019re asking, it\u2019s called the Muur van Geraardsbergen. And here\u2019s \u2018The Cannibal\u2019 on the 1969 Tour we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of, and the 17th stage: Luchon to Mourenx, where he seized control in the mountains. Let\u2019s share some Eddy Merckx memories as we are celebrating the great man this weekend. 180km to go: The breakaway group already have over three minutes on the main field. Gavin Laverty has an outside bet for you. \u201cJust read the preamble. Speaking of coming forces that never quite came, what do you feel about Tejay van Garderen\u2019s chances this year. He did have a half decent criterium but is 80-1 for Le tour!\u201d It looks like he is in the role of super-domestique for Roberto Rigoberto Uran, another contender I didn\u2019t mention but who knows this year? 187 km to go: There\u2019s the rather unseemly sight of a horde of riders taking a comfort break by the side of the road; they must have overdone the fluids in their preparations. Here comes three weeks of pain. There\u2019s an attempted breakaway from the start from Team Katusha, with Greg Van Avermaet, Natnael Berhane, Mads W\u00fcrtz Schmidt and Xando Meurisse. Two Belgians in there look like they fancy a go from Kilometre 0 in their home country. The other two are an Eritrean and a Dane. The peloton sits up a bit and lets that group of four go away. It\u2019s lively on the streets of Brussels, where the public will see the finish later this afternoon. Here\u2019s the route for today while the riders are going through the ceremonials with a ride through a sunny Brussels, before the d\u00e9part r\u00e9el can begin in a kilometre or so. Bonjour. We go again, though there is many an absent friend not on this year\u2019s Tour. No Tom Dumoulin. No Chris Froome. No Mark Cavendish. And the Sky Train will have to be renamed the rather unwieldy Ineos Train. Still, there\u2019s always G, as in Geraint Thomas the defending champion. To call him a surprise winner last year is something of an understatement, and there is the possibility he will be on the end of a similar overturning of team orders as that which he performed last year with Froome. Egan Bernal hauled the dear, departed Sky Train over the mountains last season, burying himself in the process. With Froome having to become one of the oldest ever winners to make five Tours if he comes back next year - itself not guaranteed - and G 33 himself, the 22-year-old has time and talent on his side. Who are the other contenders? This is a highly open field, with former winner Vincenzo Nibali perhaps fancying a, er, nibble, then there\u2019s Nairo Quintana, the coming force who never managed to get away far enough on the mountains. And Thibaut Pinot, who has a puncher\u2019s chance of becoming the first French winner since Bernard Hinault in 1985. So, perhaps, has Romain Bardet. That is not an exhaustive list of the possibilities. This weekend, though, with its pootle through Belgium, is a tribute to Eddy Merckx, this being the 50th anniversary of his first win of five Tours. Merckx was \u201cthe cannibal\u201d who ate his rivals for breakfast, probably the best rider of all during the spell from 1969 to 1974, before he suddenly pegged out in 1975. Today\u2019s stage takes us through some Classic-style cobbles - pav\u00e9, if you will - and a couple of small but troublesome climbs - the Bosberg and \u2018the Muur\u2019 - and then back to Belgium\u2019s capital for waffles, animal-strength beer and most likely a sprint. Elia Viviani, Dylan Groenewegen, Peter Sagan and Andre Griepel are the men expected to be dipping for the line.",

Struggling with injury, she checked out at Roland Garros. Her confidence battered, she arrived at Wimbledon edgy and unconvinced about her own chances on grass. Introspection struck. The second seed lasted an agonising hour and 36 minutes in the first round against the no-nonsense Kazakh Yulia Putintseva. Asked if the fact the women\u2019s Tour is so strong made her defeat any more bearable, she looked near to tears. \u201cNo. That makes me feel worse because now there\u2019s going to be more people that are saying, like, you know, exactly what you\u2019re saying. So, no, it doesn\u2019t make me feel better.\u201d</p> <p>Normally as open as a window, she point-blank refused to talk about why she had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/12/world-no-1-naomi-osaka-splits-with-coach-two-weeks-after-australian-open-win\" title=\"\">sacked her coach, Sascha Bajin</a>, after they had won back-to-back majors together.

Now she had neither.</p> <p>All of which is not to say that Gauff, the new darling, will suffer this depressing \u2013 and hopefully temporary \u2013 spiral into undiluted sadness. The outward signs are that the Atlanta-born teenager is on top of it. Certainly she was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/01/cori-coco-gauff-beats-venus-williams-wimbledon-first-round\" title=\"\">all over the five-times champion Venus Williams</a> in the first round, just as Osaka was packing her bags.</p> <p>Gauff, whose game-face is the polar opposite of her off-court visage \u2013 stern, fixed, professional \u2013 then had too much game for Magdalena Rybarikova, a former semi-finalist and, on the most memorable Friday evening most present could remember, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/05/cori-gauff-polona-hercog\" title=\"\">she played the game of her life to see off the solid Polona Hercog</a>, saving two match points and converting the first one that came her way, after two hours and 46 minutes.</p> <p>What was remarkable about her performance was not so much the power and brilliance that carried her through the early exchanges and got her back to parity in a fighting second set but the maturity she showed at the finish.

There would be no grand finish. No flourishes to please the new audience. Gauff fought off the gathering tiredness and got the job done \u2013 at 15. It was an astonishing display.</p> <p>She looks to have all the right people around her. Roger Federer\u2019s Team8 management group handle the commercial side of her young career, which is about to balloon her bank account to breaking point.

      "bodyText": "The prodigy looked out at a sea of faces she recognised only as recently won friends, cheerleaders, really, mutual strangers wondering what the other was thinking. Everyone loved her, though. She was the next big thing in women\u2019s tennis, here to shake up the grand and ageing order. Asked if she could confirm where she lived \u2013 Boca Raton or Fort Lauderdale \u2013 she said with a sad smile: \u201cIt\u2019s confidential where I live.\u201d Not Cori Gauff (who is happy to confirm she lives in Delray Beach, Florida) but Naomi Osaka. Remember her? She was talking after a significant moment of tennis history, only six months ago, when she beat Petra Kvitova to win the Australian Open, her second major on the spin \u2013 something only Serena Williams has done in recent years. She rose to No 1 in the world. Many millions flowed her way in endorsements. Nobody, at that point, had much heard of Cori \u201cCoco\u201d Gauff, just 15. Osaka is 21. Yesterday\u2019s prodigy. There has always been something fragile about Osaka. Struggling with injury, she checked out at Roland Garros. Her confidence battered, she arrived at Wimbledon edgy and unconvinced about her own chances on grass. Introspection struck. The second seed lasted an agonising hour and 36 minutes in the first round against the no-nonsense Kazakh Yulia Putintseva. Asked if the fact the women\u2019s Tour is so strong made her defeat any more bearable, she looked near to tears. \u201cNo. That makes me feel worse because now there\u2019s going to be more people that are saying, like, you know, exactly what you\u2019re saying. So, no, it doesn\u2019t make me feel better.\u201d Normally as open as a window, she point-blank refused to talk about why she had sacked her coach, Sascha Bajin, after they had won back-to-back majors together. In Melbourne she said it was because she refused to put, \u201cresults before happiness\u201d. Now she had neither. All of which is not to say that Gauff, the new darling, will suffer this depressing \u2013 and hopefully temporary \u2013 spiral into undiluted sadness. The outward signs are that the Atlanta-born teenager is on top of it. Certainly she was all over the five-times champion Venus Williams in the first round, just as Osaka was packing her bags. Gauff, whose game-face is the polar opposite of her off-court visage \u2013 stern, fixed, professional \u2013 then had too much game for Magdalena Rybarikova, a former semi-finalist and, on the most memorable Friday evening most present could remember, she played the game of her life to see off the solid Polona Hercog, saving two match points and converting the first one that came her way, after two hours and 46 minutes. What was remarkable about her performance was not so much the power and brilliance that carried her through the early exchanges and got her back to parity in a fighting second set but the maturity she showed at the finish. Rally after rally towards the end of the third turned into a test of patience and judgment, a war of slices and deep, measured ground strokes. Hercog, 13 years older, the owner of three career titles in singles, a tour veteran who had seen it all, could do no more than go with her. There would be no grand finish. No flourishes to please the new audience. Gauff fought off the gathering tiredness and got the job done \u2013 at 15. It was an astonishing display. She looks to have all the right people around her. Roger Federer\u2019s Team8 management group handle the commercial side of her young career, which is about to balloon her bank account to breaking point. Gauff\u2019s father, a former college\u2011level basketball player, handles coaching; her mother, a former teacher, takes care of her home-schooling. She has been a guest of Patrick Mouratoglou\u2019s Mediterranean academy for several years. And she has just won at least a million hearts.

      "bodyText": "One of the first things you notice as you enter Swiss-born interior designer Ana Engelhorn\u2019s elegant London period home is the original wooden staircase painted dark green. It\u2019s set against the cheery brightness of the hallway, painted in Papers and Paints\u2019 Soane Yellow \u2013 an homage to Ana\u2019s mother. She told her: \u201cWhen you open a door you want to be happy to go inside.\u201d There are flashes of colour everywhere in the stucco-fronted Belgravia rental property she and her husband Carlos moved into last year, with their two young children, their nanny and Persian cat Duke. Not able to change anything structurally, Ana\u2019s solution was to give the house a makeover with colour and reinvent the space. \u201cThe owner agreed I could change the style, which was mainly beige carpets and walls,\u201d she explains. \u201cSo I painted most of the rooms, uncovered all the fireplaces and pulled up the carpets to reveal the wooden floors underneath. I like seeing the uneven textures, the perfectly imperfect,\u201d she explains. The colours intensify as you progress through the house. Vivid fuchsia pink curtains in Varese velvet from Designers Guild are striking against the ruling emerald green walls of the dining room. They also frame a cosy reading nook in the window where the lower panes are tinted. \u201cI created this area. It\u2019s perfect, because during the day nobody can see you sitting there,\u201d Ana says. Looming over the Conran round marble table is an impressive chandelier made from recycled glass bottles from Luzio in Barcelona, while the original Georgian inbuilt cupboards provide display spots for glassware and ceramics. The dining area opens on to the kitchen with Victorian-era copper pots hanging on the walls, and to eke out the space, the adjoining garage now moonlights as a storage area. \u201cThe kitchen was big, but it had no prepping space and I\u2019m someone who loves to cook a lot,\u201d says Ana. \u201cSo I painted the cupboards in a pale pink and added colourful door knobs, and then took out the breakfast table and made a bar area. Now I have more space for my coffee machines and bread makers and a place to bake!\u201d On the first floor, the living room\u2019s striking Highland-green paint works perfectly with the modern blush pink and midnight blue velvet sofas. They are complemented by a mid-century brass terrace coffee table and large-scale art on the walls. A creaky-floored reading room in ruby red, which Ana designed like \u201cone of the small sitting rooms you\u2019d find in a hotel,\u201d entices you in with its art deco chairs and shimmering 1900s crystal Venini sconces from Gallery 25. Ana is an avid collector \u2013 of art, antiques, furniture. Maybe a little bit of a hoarder too. \u201cI\u2019ve moved a lot so I have things in storage, and I like to keep things as you never know if you\u2019re going to find those things again,\u201d she laughs. She cites her suppliers as inspiration to her evolving style. \u201cEspecially those who are a little more out there,\u201d she says. She was also inspired by her parents. \u201cThey\u2019ve always had an eccentric flair for interiors and they love travelling and buying and placing antiques.\u201d Memories are collected, too: a colourful patchwork crochet blanket was made by her husband\u2019s 90-year-old grandmother over 50 years ago. \u201cI like mixing contemporary pieces with those that have a history,\u201d Ana says. The uncluttered assemblage of antique curiosities and contemporary design set against a considered mix of reclaimed materials creates contrasting moods in the house, as do the atmospheric and surreal paintings and sculptures by Spanish artists Alicia Mart\u00edn, Miguel Macaya and Samuel Salcedo. \u201cArt is important to me and I like to bring it into clients\u2019 homes,\u201d explains Ana. \u201cEspecially when they might not have been brave enough to experiment with colour, it can really add something. Walls are so big, they need to tell a story.\u201d A framed photograph of the sea, printed large and given solitary prominence on the gentian blue walls, offers a calming narrative in the master bedroom. Through the adjoining dressing room where the floor is lined with decorative high heels there is a large en suite bathroom with marble-topped fittings.

Her new film, <em><a href=\"https://alisonklayman.com/the-brink\" title=\"\">The Brink</a></em>, follows Steve Bannon, Donald Trump\u2019s former chief strategist, in the 13 months following his acrimonious departure from the White House in 2017. It covers a period during which Bannon campaigned for Republicans such as Roy Moore, the far-right Alabama politician who was accused of sexual misconduct, and established a new pan-European populist organisation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/21/steve-bannon-plans-foundation-to-fuel-far-right-in-europe\" title=\"\">the Movement</a>.</p> <p><strong>Why did Bannon give you so much access? Is it because, as he says in the film, he learn</strong><strong>ed from Trump that there is no such thing as \u201cbad media\u201d? </strong><br>Only he knows the answer to that. When my producer approached him, she appealed to his ego and his vanity. He\u2019s into the Great Man version of history, and he\u2019s certain he\u2019s one of those great men.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It really is about the banality of evil</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>How did you think of Bannon when you began following him? Did you feel differently about him by the end of the process? </strong><br>At first, I wanted the answer to two questions. One was: could I stand to spend so much time with someone whose rhetoric I abhor? The second was: is he going to be a good character for a documentary? Will he reveal himself? I felt quite quickly that the answer to the second question was yes. He talks a lot. My philosophy was to let him underestimate me, but never to allow myself to underestimate him. As time went on, he did not impress me. I came in with ideas about his values, but I didn\u2019t know much about the substance of his platform, and I discovered that to be rather unimpressive. A lot of it is really just talking points. He is good at working wealthy donors and the press, and those were the fumes he was running on.</p> <p><strong>In the film, John Thornton, the </strong><strong>former president of Goldman Sachs</strong><strong>, describes Bannon as charming. Is he? </strong><br>I think it\u2019s possible to see someone as charming, but to not be charmed yourself. But the audience gets to draw its own conclusions. What\u2019s risky about the film, but essential, is that you encounter him as a person. It\u2019s important for people to understand that the inhumane consequences [of political decisions] both in history and in the present moment are perpetrated by humans. It really is about the banality of evil.</p> <p><strong>How much of what he says does he believe? Is some of it just posturing: an attempt to wind liberals up? </strong><br>The hallmark of the Bannon way of looking at the world is to be concerned about tactics and strategy, not the outcome or the ethics. He\u2019s self-interested, and he often does what is expedient. But just because he\u2019s interested in being important and successful and enriching himself, it doesn\u2019t follow that he doesn\u2019t believe in what he is doing.</p> <p><strong>Bannon loves to attack the so-called elite but in the film he travels on private planes</strong><strong> and stays in five-star hotels. Were you surprised by his lifestyle, and that of his associates? </strong><br>I was pleased to be able to show visually the hypocrisy of his policies. But I was less surprised at the wealth of the people he worked with than at their proximity to the mainstream corporate America and global politics: Hollywood, finance, Silicon Valley, senior Republicans and Democrats were all on the phone. I was surprised they were willing to be seen with him, though a lot weren\u2019t.</p> <p><strong>Did he meet Boris Johnson when you were with him? </strong><br>I don\u2019t know that they saw each other in person, but he was unequivocal that they were in touch.</p> <p><strong>But he did meet Nigel Farage. What did you make of their relationship? </strong><br>Farage seemed like all the others who came to kiss the ring. Bannon holds court and people come to him, the one exception being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/16/guo-wengui-the-maverick-chinese-billionaire-who-threatens-to-crash-xis-party\" title=\"\">Miles Kwok</a> [the Chinese billionaire]. They clearly had history, a mutual admiration. Out of that meeting came one of my favourite lines in the film. Bannon says: \u201cI think I can fund it, this group [the Movement]. All we need are the ideas.\u201d It seemed comical then. It\u2019s so empty. But it\u2019s a reminder that just because people are dismissible in terms of their substance, their tactics can still work. Farage hadn\u2019t started his new party then, but look at it now.</p> <p><strong>In one scene, Bannon meets with members of various European far-right parties. This is chilling to watch, but it\u2019s also fantastical</strong><strong>. Is he, perhaps, a bit of a fabulist? </strong><br>Those are the questions to have in your mind. Some of those people are high-level, but others are from insignificant parties, or they\u2019ve been kicked out of their parties. After I filmed that scene in London last summer, I took one of the unfinished bottles of wine from their dinner table up to my room and I called my husband, and said: \u201cEither I just filmed the Wannsee Conference [a meeting of senior Nazis in 1942], or I filmed a bunch of jerks having dinner.\u201d <em>The Brink</em> ends with the 2018 US midterm elections, when the Democrats took back Congress. The right is beatable. But even if Bannon isn\u2019t all he says he is, it would be a disservice to tell people not to worry. The fight needs to continue.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZMpmJumYZI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2ZMpmJumYZI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZMpmJumYZI\">Watch a trailer for The Brink.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>Bannon insists he hated working at the White House. Did you believe him? </strong><br>That reeked of: I broke up with him, he didn\u2019t break up with me. But the constraints of the White House, even a White House under Trump, and the relative lack of glamour \u2013 the fact he couldn\u2019t just raise money and spend money with no oversight \u2013 probably did cramp his style. Also, the fact that he couldn\u2019t just play Trump like a piano.</p> <p><strong>There\u2019s no hint of a personal life in</strong><em><strong> The Brink</strong></em><strong>. Bannon jokes that he doesn\u2019t even know what the phrase means. Does he have one? </strong><br>He worked compulsively. He used to be an alcoholic; it felt like he had replaced that addiction with work. He was dating someone, but they didn\u2019t travel with him and they didn\u2019t want to be in the film. He cares about his dad, whom I did meet, and he often talked about his oldest daughter, who was a marine [Bannon has three daughters, and three ex-wives]. But essentially, his life is encapsulated by that line: what is a personal life?</p> <p><strong>Were you with him when he saw the finished film? </strong><br>No, my producer showed it to him. He and I haven\u2019t spoken since I took the microphone off him the night of the midterms. He didn\u2019t love it, and he didn\u2019t hate it. It seemed like he was reserving judgment for how it was going to be received. And then the reviews came out, and they characterised him in a new way. The consensus was that he appears smaller; that he was given enough rope to hang himself. With Bannon, the line used to be: he\u2019s an evil genius. He\u2019s gross, but he\u2019s so powerful and effective, and therefore dangerous. He was ready \u2013 because he doesn\u2019t care about this \u2013 to be accused of being a racist. But these depictions of him as a huckster and a salesman\u2026 they were different. After that, he cut off all contact with us.</p> <p><strong>What has stayed with you since you finished the project? </strong><br>Although I\u2019m wary of hyperbole, this project was very personal. My mother\u2019s parents are Holocaust survivors, and that is a defining aspect of my identity. But the question of what it means to be complicit or a perpetrator is one that has always seemed way scarier to me than the question of what it means to be a victim. What gets people to a place where society does cruel things? If we had v\u00e9rit\u00e9 footage of the rise of the Third Reich, would it look that different from what\u2019s in my film? I\u2019m not sure that it would, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s overblown to make that connection.</p> <p><em>The Brink is in cinemas and available to watch on demand on </em><em>Friday</em></p>",

Also, the fact that he couldn\u2019t just play Trump like a piano. There\u2019s no hint of a personal life in The Brink. Bannon jokes that he doesn\u2019t even know what the phrase means. Does he have one? He worked compulsively. He used to be an alcoholic; it felt like he had replaced that addiction with work. He was dating someone, but they didn\u2019t travel with him and they didn\u2019t want to be in the film. He cares about his dad, whom I did meet, and he often talked about his oldest daughter, who was a marine [Bannon has three daughters, and three ex-wives]. But essentially, his life is encapsulated by that line: what is a personal life? Were you with him when he saw the finished film? No, my producer showed it to him. He and I haven\u2019t spoken since I took the microphone off him the night of the midterms. He didn\u2019t love it, and he didn\u2019t hate it. It seemed like he was reserving judgment for how it was going to be received. And then the reviews came out, and they characterised him in a new way. The consensus was that he appears smaller; that he was given enough rope to hang himself. With Bannon, the line used to be: he\u2019s an evil genius. He\u2019s gross, but he\u2019s so powerful and effective, and therefore dangerous. He was ready \u2013 because he doesn\u2019t care about this \u2013 to be accused of being a racist. But these depictions of him as a huckster and a salesman\u2026 they were different. After that, he cut off all contact with us. What has stayed with you since you finished the project? Although I\u2019m wary of hyperbole, this project was very personal. My mother\u2019s parents are Holocaust survivors, and that is a defining aspect of my identity. But the question of what it means to be complicit or a perpetrator is one that has always seemed way scarier to me than the question of what it means to be a victim. What gets people to a place where society does cruel things? If we had v\u00e9rit\u00e9 footage of the rise of the Third Reich, would it look that different from what\u2019s in my film? I\u2019m not sure that it would, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s overblown to make that connection. The Brink is in cinemas and available to watch on demand on Friday",

It meant the industry suffered the sharpest drop in factory output for more than six years.</p> <p>The prospect is that activity will continue to shrink as summer turns into autumn. What is remarkable is the optimism shown by most companies that some kind of Brexit deal will be done, possibly on 31 October or not too long afterwards.</p> <p>Yet while the business surveys omit to ask about attitudes to Brexit, the lack of redundancies reveals that most companies expect to emerge from the current period of stasis relatively unscathed.</p> <p>Contrary to the sense of doom from many commentators in the construction industry, Markit\u2019s researchers said: \u201cDemand for construction staff was relatively resilient in June, with the latest survey pointing to only a marginal fall in workforce numbers. Where a decline in employment was reported, this was often linked to the non-replacement of voluntary leavers.\u201d</p> <p>The same wait-and-see approach is detectable across most industries. Setting aside the 6,000 redundancies at Jaguar Land Rover, and the planned closures of Honda\u2019s car factory in Swindon and Ford\u2019s factory in south Wales, most manufacturers have hunkered down to see out the worst of Brexit.</p> <p>Sadly, the portents for manufacturers are even more gloomy than for companies in other sectors.</p> <p>Germany, the UK\u2019s largest trading partner in the EU, saw its manufacturing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/07/german-trade-decline-raises-fears-over-global-economy\" title=\"\">\u201cdrop off a cliff\u201d</a> in May. Industrial orders fell 2.2% month-on-month when analysts were only expecting a marginal 0.2% drop.</p> <p>Once bulk orders were stripped out the May data was even worse, declining by 3% from the previous month.</p> <p>\u201cThis clearly suggests that the deterioration was genuine and not due to fluctuations in volatile bulk orders,\u201d said analysts at HSBC.</p> <p>Without Germany driving Europe\u2019s factory output, the countries that rely on supplying this beast with parts \u2013 namely the British, Italian, Austrian, Czech and Swiss manufacturing industries \u2013 will suffer a downturn of their own.</p> <p>The rest of Europe is not faring much better. A lack of demand across the 19-member euro currency bloc has already meant inflation is weak and prompted the European Central Bank to say it will begin a further stimulus programme.</p> <p>At the margins, a cut in borrowing costs might help boost investment from the current lows levels, but it is unlikely to be the turbocharger needed.</p> <p>For UK companies to begin growing again, business leaders are clear that the Brexit issue needs to be laid to rest, sooner rather than later.</p>",

Construction industry output was said to have \u201cdropped like a stone\u201d while manufacturers suffered a similar reversal, with a majority saying order books were shrinking and current activity was down on the previous month. It meant the industry suffered the sharpest drop in factory output for more than six years. The prospect is that activity will continue to shrink as summer turns into autumn. What is remarkable is the optimism shown by most companies that some kind of Brexit deal will be done, possibly on 31 October or not too long afterwards. Yet while the business surveys omit to ask about attitudes to Brexit, the lack of redundancies reveals that most companies expect to emerge from the current period of stasis relatively unscathed. Contrary to the sense of doom from many commentators in the construction industry, Markit\u2019s researchers said: \u201cDemand for construction staff was relatively resilient in June, with the latest survey pointing to only a marginal fall in workforce numbers. Where a decline in employment was reported, this was often linked to the non-replacement of voluntary leavers.\u201d The same wait-and-see approach is detectable across most industries. Setting aside the 6,000 redundancies at Jaguar Land Rover, and the planned closures of Honda\u2019s car factory in Swindon and Ford\u2019s factory in south Wales, most manufacturers have hunkered down to see out the worst of Brexit. Sadly, the portents for manufacturers are even more gloomy than for companies in other sectors. Germany, the UK\u2019s largest trading partner in the EU, saw its manufacturing \u201cdrop off a cliff\u201d in May. Industrial orders fell 2.2% month-on-month when analysts were only expecting a marginal 0.2% drop. Once bulk orders were stripped out the May data was even worse, declining by 3% from the previous month. \u201cThis clearly suggests that the deterioration was genuine and not due to fluctuations in volatile bulk orders,\u201d said analysts at HSBC. Without Germany driving Europe\u2019s factory output, the countries that rely on supplying this beast with parts \u2013 namely the British, Italian, Austrian, Czech and Swiss manufacturing industries \u2013 will suffer a downturn of their own. The rest of Europe is not faring much better. A lack of demand across the 19-member euro currency bloc has already meant inflation is weak and prompted the European Central Bank to say it will begin a further stimulus programme. At the margins, a cut in borrowing costs might help boost investment from the current lows levels, but it is unlikely to be the turbocharger needed. For UK companies to begin growing again, business leaders are clear that the Brexit issue needs to be laid to rest, sooner rather than later.",

      "bodyText": "The impact of Britain\u2019s high street downturn is not just measured in frontline retail jobs. When the specialist retailer Bathstore collapsed last month, 500 shopfloor and head office jobs were put at risk. But up to 300 bathroom fitters also face an uncertain future \u2013 a reminder that behind every high-profile failure, a string of suppliers and small businesses are paying a price too. The self-employed Bathstore contractors have collectively been left about \u00a33m out of pocket, according to the British Institute of Kitchen, Bedroom &amp; Bathroom Installation (BiKBBI), after the company called in administrators. While the difficulties for customers left with half-finished renovation projects or no working toilet have already been flagged, the financial pain for unpaid contractors, some of whom will now face bankruptcy or be forced to borrow heavily to survive, are only beginning to emerge. Bathstore took payment from customers three weeks before work started but did not pay contractors until two or more weeks after the job had finished. When it went into administration, both customers and fitters lost out. The chain of 131 stores continues to trade as the advisory firm BDO seeks a buyer, but the self-employed fitters are unlikely to receive any money for jobs completed. Under insolvency rules, contractors must join a long list of unsecured creditors and are unlikely to receive more than 2% or 3% of the money they are owed. \u201cThe government references small and medium-sized enterprises [SMEs] as the backbone of the economy, but the backbone will be leaving the building. We need to start looking after these people,\u201d says Damian Walters, chief executive of BiKBBI. \u201cThis is not a new issue, we have seen it time and time again. It seems like Groundhog Day. What are we going to do to protect SMEs from this situation again?\u201d Retailers that take payment up front should have to put a contractor\u2019s cash into a protected account until a job is completed, he suggests, so that they do not lose out if a company goes bust. The bathroom fitters\u2019 fate echoes that of small construction firms and suppliers for Carillion, which lost out when the outsourcing group went bust, and that of thousands of self-employed couriers for City Link whose jobs were abruptly axedThe when the delivery firm when into administration in 2014.

      "body": "<p>After five years in the brothel, Labonni stopped dreaming of being rescued. Ever since she had been sold to a madam at 13 years old, customers had promised to help her escape. None had followed through. Over time, their faces began to blur together, so she couldn\u2019t remember exactly who had visited before, or how many men had come by that day. There\u2019s usually one every hour, starting from 9am.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes I wake up and I don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m not dead yet,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Now 19, Labonni says she\u2019s resigned to life \u2013 and death \u2013 in Mymensingh, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/may/17/children-trapped-bangladesh-brothel-village-video\" title=\"\">brothel village</a> in the centre of Bangladesh. Here, between 700 and 1,000 women and girls are working in the sex trade \u2013 many of them against their will.</p> <p>Girls as young as 12 sleep five to a room; their beds only cordoned off by torn cotton curtains. Music blares from heavyset sound systems and homemade liquor is poured from plastic bottles to numb the pain. Men swagger shirtless down the alleys looking for girls. Ten minutes of sex will cost them TK400 (about \u00a33.66) \u2013 but it\u2019s money that mainly lands in the pockets of those running the brothel.</p> <p>Like the majority of girls in Mymensingh, Labonni was trafficked into sex work. On the run at 13 years old, she left her six-month-old daughter behind to flee the abusive husband she had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/apr/29/girls-in-bangladesh-learn-to-talk-their-way-out-of-forced-marriage\" title=\"\">made to marry</a> the year before, in a ceremony that took place on the same day she started her period. \u201cI didn\u2019t know where I was going,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI thought maybe I could find work in a garment factory.\u201d</p> <p>A woman saw her looking tearful in Dhaka railway station, and offered her food and a place to sleep for the night. Two days later, Labonni was sold by her to the brothel for about \u00a3180 and forbidden to leave.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b649be6d56235ae5138e3c6829a4b5be14642f5a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b649be6d56235ae5138e3c6829a4b5be14642f5a/0_0_4700_3133/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A graveyard for sex workers in Tangail.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A graveyard for sex workers in Tangail.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allison Joyce</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Overnight, she became a <em>chukri</em>, or bonded sex worker \u2013 imprisoned within the brothel until she repaid hundreds of pounds in fabricated debts. \u201cThe madam who bought me said that I had to pay her back,\u201d Labonni says in a flat voice. \u201cShe\u2019d bribed the police to say I was 18 [the legal age for a registered sex worker] and told me I owed her more than \u00a3914. Then she confiscated my phone and locked me in my bedroom. She said that she\u2019d hurt me if I tried to run away.\u201d After two or three months, Labonni gave up trying to escape. \u201cThey always find you,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>A quick breakdown of the figures involved shows how girls like Labonni are a vital part of a hugely profitable business model for brothel owners in Bangladesh. For the past six years, since being trapped in the brothel, she has worked continually to pay off her phantom debt. Yet over those six years she has earned upwards of \u00a346,500 for madams who enjoy lives of considerable luxury. </p> <p>Until last year everything Labonni earned went to her madam. All she was given back was a \u00a337 as a monthly allowance for food, clothes and toiletries. Labonni has now paid her original \u00a3914 \u201cdebt\u201d back 50 times over.</p> <p>Last year she was finally told she had paid off her debt, but she has yet to move on. Her mental strength is worn down by years of abuse. \u201cI feel worthless,\u201d she says. \u201cMy daughter doesn\u2019t even know I\u2019m her mum.\u201d Even with her \u201cdebt\u201d gone, she\u2019s still obliged to pay half of her weekly earnings \u2013 approximately \u00a378 \u2013 to the madams in exchange for electricity and a place to stay.</p> <p>One of her regular customers, Mohammed Muktal Ali, is 30 years old. A married bus driver from the nearby town, he has been visiting Labonni every day for four and a half years, since she was 14. \u201cAll the girls here are helpless,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t sell a boy to a brothel, but you can sell a girl because she has monetary value.\u201d He doesn\u2019t feel guilty for paying for sex with a trafficked teenager. \u201cI am in love with Labonni. I\u2019m 70% sure that one day I will rescue her.\u201d Labonni doesn\u2019t look up. \u201cI don\u2019t believe anything the men say to me any more,\u201d she says later. \u201cThey all lie.\u201d</p> <p>Four floors down from Labonni\u2019s bedroom, Farada, 33, says the number of trafficked girls has increased since she arrived at the brothel in 1999. She knows, she says, because she buys them. After 12 years entrapped in sexual slavery herself, she was given a girl as a gift by a customer eight years ago, moving from exploited to exploiter overnight. When the girl escaped, she bought a second, called Moni, for \u00a3137. \u201cI paid \u00a327 on cigarettes for the police, and they sorted all the paperwork,\u201d she says, referring to the government-mandated certificates that state every sex worker is at least 18 and consents to engaging in prostitution. \u201cNow the police charge more. It\u2019s at least \u00a3450, which is very expensive, so the girls have to pay me back.\u201d The younger the girl, the higher the bribe required by law enforcement, she adds.</p> <p>These days, she makes about \u00a3187 every week from two girls, but says a third of that goes to local gang members who control the brothel.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"61230417db3f3e49a89f503ecf8a883a1285844a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61230417db3f3e49a89f503ecf8a883a1285844a/0_0_4700_3193/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A child waits outside their mother\u2019s room while she works.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"679\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A child waits outside their mother\u2019s room while she works.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allison Joyce</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The money being made in this single brothel is an indicator of the vast profits generated by the global trade in women and girls. Sex trafficking is an enormously lucrative business.</p> <p>Academic Siddharth Kara advises the United Nations and the US government on slavery and has shown through his own research that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jul/31/human-life-is-more-expendable-why-slavery-has-never-made-more-money\" title=\"\">sex trafficking is disproportionately lucrative</a> compared with other forms of slavery. He estimates that sex trafficking creates half of the total profits generated globally by modern slavery, despite only accounting for 5% of all trafficking victims worldwide.</p> <p>He told the <em>Observer</em>: \u201cThe return on investment for sex trafficking is around 1,000% compared with much lower returns in exploitation for construction, agriculture or mining. The immense profitability of sex trafficking is \u2026 driven by the minimal expense associated with acquiring victims and the fact that the victim can be sold up to 20 times a day, generating tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of dollars in profit per victim.\u201d</p> <p>Prostitution was legalised in Bangladesh in 2000, after the year-long detention of 100 sex workers by police sparked protests calling for the women\u2019s freedom and equal rights. The women\u2019s release heralded a new legal framework, but few protections.</p> <p>Instead, the business of sexual exploitation has thrived in a country where women are oppressed in many ways. Across the country, one in five girls is married before her 15th birthday and only a quarter finish secondary education. Choice is a luxury few women here can afford.</p> <p>While <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/may/16/like-any-other-job-indian-sex-workers-lobby-for-pensions-and-healthcare\" title=\"\">prostitution</a> is legal, trafficking and forced labour are not. But poor enforcement of legislation in a country where women are easy prey means traffickers act with impunity. The Bangladesh government estimates that 100,000 women and girls are working in the country\u2019s sex industry and one study reports that <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299506841_Economics_of_Sex_Work_in_Bangladesh\" title=\"\">less than 10</a><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299506841_Economics_of_Sex_Work_in_Bangladesh\" title=\"\">% of </a><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299506841_Economics_of_Sex_Work_in_Bangladesh\" title=\"\">those had entered prostitution voluntarily</a>. This investigation found hundreds of girls who spoke of being sold by strangers, family members or husbands without their consent.</p> <p>In April the <em><a href=\"https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/nation/2019/04/21/human-trafficking-cases-no-tribunal-in-six-years-conviction-rate-less-than-half-percent\" title=\"\">Dhaka Tribune</a></em><a href=\"https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/nation/2019/04/21/human-trafficking-cases-no-tribunal-in-six-years-conviction-rate-less-than-half-percent\" title=\"\"> reported</a> that the conviction rate for people arrested in connection with trafficking is less than half a percent. While more than 6,000 people have been arrested in connection with human trafficking since 2013, only 25 were convicted. Last year <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/282798.pdf\" title=\"\">only eight traffickers were convicted in Bangladesh</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5150b7c1cdb4385e43f8bfeade13559801662028\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5150b7c1cdb4385e43f8bfeade13559801662028/0_0_4700_3133/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A girl of 14 waits for customers in Jessore brothel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A girl of 14 waits for customers in a Jessore brothel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allison Joyce</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While many girls sell sex from their homes or the street, more than 5,000 women and girls are split between 11 huge brothels countrywide. Some dating back hundreds of years, each brothel is registered with the government and monitored by the local police. Here, a triumvirate of powerful institutions \u2013 government, police and religion \u2013 watch over and approve the rape, enslavement and abuse of hundreds of thousands of prepubescent girls.</p> <p>\u201cThe Bangladeshi police know everything that takes place in the brothels,\u201d says Azharul Islam, programme manager of <a href=\"http://rightsjessore.org/\" title=\"\">Rights Jessore</a>, a local non-governmental organisation working to rehabilitate trafficked children working in the sex trade and return them to their families. \u201cThe brothel owners are involved in gangs, and our political leaders and law enforcement are involved in those gangs, too.\u201d Corrupt government officials profit by accepting bribes and sexual favours in exchange for turning a blind eye to the abuse.</p> <p>As part of this investigation, more than 20 underage girls in four of the brothels showed us their notarised certificates stating they were over 18. One girl admitted she was still 13. \u201cIt\u2019s law enforcement, it\u2019s the local mafia,\u201d says Mahmudul Kabir, Bangladesh country director for the Netherlands-based NGO <a href=\"http://www.terredeshommes.org/\" title=\"\">Terre des Hommes</a>. \u201cAnd it goes through the entire chain of power.\u201d</p> <p>The steady stream of women and children being trafficked into Bangladesh\u2019s sex industry means that the girls are disposable to those making money out of them. The numbers killing themselves has reached a point where at least two brothels in central Bangladesh \u2013 Kandapara, on the on the outskirts of Tangail, and Daulatdia, on the banks of the Padma river \u2013 have had to built private graveyards to cope with the dead.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s about one death a month,\u201d says Shilpi, 57, who was sold to Daulatdia brothel in 1977. \u201cIt never used to be this many.\u201d These days she conducts the funerals: washing each body before leading a team of 12 brothel guards through the thicket of weeds that shrouds the burial grounds; finally reciting a short prayer over the grave. She doesn\u2019t know how many girls are buried there. She lost count after 100. \u201cFor a while, we tied a stone around their necks and threw the bodies in the pond,\u201d Shilpi adds. \u201cBut sometimes they floated to the surface, so we had to find land.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cb1a0c0de342fa38d079252d9bcd0846f84cf4e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb1a0c0de342fa38d079252d9bcd0846f84cf4e2/0_0_4700_3108/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A 15-year-old girl gets married.

      "bodyText": "After five years in the brothel, Labonni stopped dreaming of being rescued. Ever since she had been sold to a madam at 13 years old, customers had promised to help her escape. None had followed through. Over time, their faces began to blur together, so she couldn\u2019t remember exactly who had visited before, or how many men had come by that day. There\u2019s usually one every hour, starting from 9am. \u201cSometimes I wake up and I don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m not dead yet,\u201d she says. Now 19, Labonni says she\u2019s resigned to life \u2013 and death \u2013 in Mymensingh, a brothel village in the centre of Bangladesh. Here, between 700 and 1,000 women and girls are working in the sex trade \u2013 many of them against their will. Girls as young as 12 sleep five to a room; their beds only cordoned off by torn cotton curtains. Music blares from heavyset sound systems and homemade liquor is poured from plastic bottles to numb the pain. Men swagger shirtless down the alleys looking for girls. Ten minutes of sex will cost them TK400 (about \u00a33.66) \u2013 but it\u2019s money that mainly lands in the pockets of those running the brothel. Like the majority of girls in Mymensingh, Labonni was trafficked into sex work. On the run at 13 years old, she left her six-month-old daughter behind to flee the abusive husband she had been made to marry the year before, in a ceremony that took place on the same day she started her period. \u201cI didn\u2019t know where I was going,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI thought maybe I could find work in a garment factory.\u201d A woman saw her looking tearful in Dhaka railway station, and offered her food and a place to sleep for the night. Two days later, Labonni was sold by her to the brothel for about \u00a3180 and forbidden to leave. Overnight, she became a chukri, or bonded sex worker \u2013 imprisoned within the brothel until she repaid hundreds of pounds in fabricated debts. \u201cThe madam who bought me said that I had to pay her back,\u201d Labonni says in a flat voice. \u201cShe\u2019d bribed the police to say I was 18 [the legal age for a registered sex worker] and told me I owed her more than \u00a3914. Then she confiscated my phone and locked me in my bedroom. She said that she\u2019d hurt me if I tried to run away.\u201d After two or three months, Labonni gave up trying to escape. \u201cThey always find you,\u201d she adds. A quick breakdown of the figures involved shows how girls like Labonni are a vital part of a hugely profitable business model for brothel owners in Bangladesh. For the past six years, since being trapped in the brothel, she has worked continually to pay off her phantom debt. Yet over those six years she has earned upwards of \u00a346,500 for madams who enjoy lives of considerable luxury. Until last year everything Labonni earned went to her madam. All she was given back was a \u00a337 as a monthly allowance for food, clothes and toiletries. Labonni has now paid her original \u00a3914 \u201cdebt\u201d back 50 times over. Last year she was finally told she had paid off her debt, but she has yet to move on. Her mental strength is worn down by years of abuse. \u201cI feel worthless,\u201d she says. \u201cMy daughter doesn\u2019t even know I\u2019m her mum.\u201d Even with her \u201cdebt\u201d gone, she\u2019s still obliged to pay half of her weekly earnings \u2013 approximately \u00a378 \u2013 to the madams in exchange for electricity and a place to stay. One of her regular customers, Mohammed Muktal Ali, is 30 years old. A married bus driver from the nearby town, he has been visiting Labonni every day for four and a half years, since she was 14. \u201cAll the girls here are helpless,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t sell a boy to a brothel, but you can sell a girl because she has monetary value.\u201d He doesn\u2019t feel guilty for paying for sex with a trafficked teenager. \u201cI am in love with Labonni. I\u2019m 70% sure that one day I will rescue her.\u201d Labonni doesn\u2019t look up. \u201cI don\u2019t believe anything the men say to me any more,\u201d she says later. \u201cThey all lie.\u201d Four floors down from Labonni\u2019s bedroom, Farada, 33, says the number of trafficked girls has increased since she arrived at the brothel in 1999. She knows, she says, because she buys them. After 12 years entrapped in sexual slavery herself, she was given a girl as a gift by a customer eight years ago, moving from exploited to exploiter overnight. When the girl escaped, she bought a second, called Moni, for \u00a3137. \u201cI paid \u00a327 on cigarettes for the police, and they sorted all the paperwork,\u201d she says, referring to the government-mandated certificates that state every sex worker is at least 18 and consents to engaging in prostitution. \u201cNow the police charge more. It\u2019s at least \u00a3450, which is very expensive, so the girls have to pay me back.\u201d The younger the girl, the higher the bribe required by law enforcement, she adds. These days, she makes about \u00a3187 every week from two girls, but says a third of that goes to local gang members who control the brothel. The money being made in this single brothel is an indicator of the vast profits generated by the global trade in women and girls. Sex trafficking is an enormously lucrative business. Academic Siddharth Kara advises the United Nations and the US government on slavery and has shown through his own research that sex trafficking is disproportionately lucrative compared with other forms of slavery. He estimates that sex trafficking creates half of the total profits generated globally by modern slavery, despite only accounting for 5% of all trafficking victims worldwide. He told the Observer: \u201cThe return on investment for sex trafficking is around 1,000% compared with much lower returns in exploitation for construction, agriculture or mining. The immense profitability of sex trafficking is \u2026 driven by the minimal expense associated with acquiring victims and the fact that the victim can be sold up to 20 times a day, generating tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of dollars in profit per victim.\u201d Prostitution was legalised in Bangladesh in 2000, after the year-long detention of 100 sex workers by police sparked protests calling for the women\u2019s freedom and equal rights. The women\u2019s release heralded a new legal framework, but few protections. Instead, the business of sexual exploitation has thrived in a country where women are oppressed in many ways. Across the country, one in five girls is married before her 15th birthday and only a quarter finish secondary education. Choice is a luxury few women here can afford. While prostitution is legal, trafficking and forced labour are not. But poor enforcement of legislation in a country where women are easy prey means traffickers act with impunity. The Bangladesh government estimates that 100,000 women and girls are working in the country\u2019s sex industry and one study reports that less than 10% of those had entered prostitution voluntarily. This investigation found hundreds of girls who spoke of being sold by strangers, family members or husbands without their consent. In April the Dhaka Tribune reported that the conviction rate for people arrested in connection with trafficking is less than half a percent. While more than 6,000 people have been arrested in connection with human trafficking since 2013, only 25 were convicted. Last year only eight traffickers were convicted in Bangladesh. While many girls sell sex from their homes or the street, more than 5,000 women and girls are split between 11 huge brothels countrywide. Some dating back hundreds of years, each brothel is registered with the government and monitored by the local police. Here, a triumvirate of powerful institutions \u2013 government, police and religion \u2013 watch over and approve the rape, enslavement and abuse of hundreds of thousands of prepubescent girls. \u201cThe Bangladeshi police know everything that takes place in the brothels,\u201d says Azharul Islam, programme manager of Rights Jessore, a local non-governmental organisation working to rehabilitate trafficked children working in the sex trade and return them to their families. \u201cThe brothel owners are involved in gangs, and our political leaders and law enforcement are involved in those gangs, too.\u201d Corrupt government officials profit by accepting bribes and sexual favours in exchange for turning a blind eye to the abuse. As part of this investigation, more than 20 underage girls in four of the brothels showed us their notarised certificates stating they were over 18. One girl admitted she was still 13. \u201cIt\u2019s law enforcement, it\u2019s the local mafia,\u201d says Mahmudul Kabir, Bangladesh country director for the Netherlands-based NGO Terre des Hommes. \u201cAnd it goes through the entire chain of power.\u201d The steady stream of women and children being trafficked into Bangladesh\u2019s sex industry means that the girls are disposable to those making money out of them. The numbers killing themselves has reached a point where at least two brothels in central Bangladesh \u2013 Kandapara, on the on the outskirts of Tangail, and Daulatdia, on the banks of the Padma river \u2013 have had to built private graveyards to cope with the dead. \u201cThere\u2019s about one death a month,\u201d says Shilpi, 57, who was sold to Daulatdia brothel in 1977. \u201cIt never used to be this many.\u201d These days she conducts the funerals: washing each body before leading a team of 12 brothel guards through the thicket of weeds that shrouds the burial grounds; finally reciting a short prayer over the grave. She doesn\u2019t know how many girls are buried there. She lost count after 100. \u201cFor a while, we tied a stone around their necks and threw the bodies in the pond,\u201d Shilpi adds. \u201cBut sometimes they floated to the surface, so we had to find land.\u201d In Mymensingh, there\u2019s no such graveyard \u2013 but not from lack of need. Instead, bodies are carried out to the countryside at nightfall; buried in unmarked graves by torchlight. Public graveyards aren\u2019t an option: the stigma that surrounds sex workers in Bangladesh forbids their burial in municipal ground. \u201cHere we are shameful, bad women,\u201d says Shilpi. \u201cIf a girl kills herself, people say it\u2019s good riddance \u2013 it\u2019s just a quicker way for them to get to hell.\u201d. Labonni has also tried to kill herself several times. \u201cI\u2019ll probably try again one day,\u201d she says, sitting on the floor of the concrete cell that passes as a bedroom: her customers\u2019 phone numbers are scratched into the wall. Meanwhile, she cuts herself daily. Such deep-rooted mental health problems are endemic among Bangladesh\u2019s bonded brothel workers, and make it harder for them to move on even when their \u201cdebts\u201d are paid. Though there is little mental health support for the women, there is evidence that when it\u2019s provided, it helps.

En route to yet another Neville press conference he displays deep knowledge of Newcastle United, expresses concern about Rafa Ben\u00edtez\u2019s departure and asks why Neville has not been shortlisted.

      "body": "<p>In the seaside town of Eken\u00e4s, south-west of Helsinki, there is a name that appears wherever you go: Helene Schjerfbeck. A street lined with early-19th-century weatherboard houses is named after her, and at the Helene Schjerfbeck cafe they serve lingonberry and bitter chocolate cake with the initials HS picked out in sugar. An actor, Anne Ingman, has made it her vocation to impersonate Schjerfbeck in a floor-length black costume with a battered leather handbag and a jade brooch like one Schjerfbeck wore. She guides visitors through a park where Schjerfbeck painted, tells stories about her life and points out a modern artwork by AK Dolven, <a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IHzBO4Wlj9w/TqQQlrBn2KI/AAAAAAAAG5U/IMxWuGzE6uo/s1600/dolven.jpg\" title=\"\">a bell high in the oak trees</a> that can be heard across town. Send not to know for whom the bell tolls: it is another homage to Schjerfbeck.</p> <p>In Helsinki\u2019s Ateneum, Finland\u2019s national gallery, Schjerfbeck (1862-1946) has been, through the latter part of her lifetime and since her death, one of Finland\u2019s best-loved artists. But in the UK she remains little known. This month, at the Royal Academy, a solo show of 65 paintings (she made more than 1,000 in her lifetime) is about to put this right. Schjerfbeck started in the style of French naturalists such as Jules Bastien-Lepage before becoming an early modernist. She is sometimes described, according to the Ateneum\u2019s chief curator and co-curator of the Royal Academy show Anna-Maria von Bonsdorff, as \u201cFinland\u2019s Munch\u201d, though at the same time she is \u201cindividual \u2013 distinctively herself\u201d and not as histrionic as her Norwegian counterpart. Royal Academy assistant curator Rebecca Bray suggests that through the \u201cintimacy and interiority\u201d in her work, she has more in common with the Danish painter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2008/jun/25/art.denmark\" title=\"\">Vilhelm Hammersh\u00f8i</a>, sharing his melancholic grace. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Her self-portraits put her in the company of Goya, Rembrandt, Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Schjerfbeck was single-minded, ambitious, tending to the reclusive and yet a chic dresser with a keen interest in fashion. Her self-portraits are her most extraordinary achievement and she painted these throughout her life. She would underplay their relevance, breezily observing that they were produced for convenience (she was, after all, always available as a model). Von Bonsdorff laughs at this, sees it as a self-protective evasion \u2013 Schjerfbeck did not want to be an object of scrutiny and was determined to discourage curious visitors. But her self-portraits are an inquiry into mortality. They put her in the company of Goya, Rembrandt, Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud.</p> <p>The self-portraits painted towards the end of her life, when she was dying of cancer in a sanatorium, show an understanding that a person is made up of everything they have ever been: she detects a youthfulness within age. By the time she is painting <em>Green Self-Portrait: Light and Shadows</em> (1945), you can see that dust will soon follow: the skull beneath the skin is visible, the shadow of death. Through the dissolution of precise features, she paints a ghost of her former self.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ffef45ff39925257c51d7f4101d59ead61ddbd43\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffef45ff39925257c51d7f4101d59ead61ddbd43/0_0_2343_2896/809.jpg\" alt=\"Helene Schjerfbeck, Self-portrait with Red Spot, 1944.\" width=\"809\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Helene Schjerfbeck, Self-portrait with Red Spot, 1944.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: G\u00f6sta and Bertha Stenman Donation. Finnish National Gallery/Ateneum Art Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The power in these paintings, says Bray, is the sense of \u201ccoming face to face with the interior of someone who is very ill and yet, at the same time, has a continuing will to work\u201d. Their inwardness fascinates: Schjerfbeck frequently paints herself (and others) with an averted gaze \u2013 the eyes escaping towards the skirting board or into the corners of a room. The displaced intensity is reminiscent of lines from an Emily Dickinson poem: \u201cI cannot live with You \u2013 It would be Life \u2013 And Life is over there \u2013 Behind the Shelf.\u201d The sense is that what matters is at an angle, at one remove \u2013 elsewhere.</p> <p>Von Bonsdorff says Schjerfbeck never explained her preference for the averted gaze but believes it to be, in part, a further illustration of her need for privacy. In 1915, the Ateneum commissioned a self-portrait for an exhibition after a period during which she had felt ignored by the establishment. She was pleased to be the only female artist invited to participate (she was not a militant feminist but supported women\u2019s suffrage \u2013 Finland was the first European country to give women the vote). In the resulting painting (used on the poster for the Royal Academy show), she has daubed herself with rouge and positioned a vermilion paint pot beside her. Her name is on the canvas, Holbein-style. It is a wan, authoritative and unnerving piece. </p> <p>Helene Schjerfbeck was born on 10 July 1862 in Helsinki. It is said that her artistic life began when, aged four, she fell down the front steps of the family\u2019s house and broke her hip. It was a bad break, inexpertly set, and left her with a limp for life. But it was while she was convalescing that her father gave her pencils and she started to draw. She later said: \u201cWhen you give a child a pencil, you give her an entire world.\u201d In her case, it was true and her talent would soon prove impossible to ignore.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8439e8564aafeab1172896d399134ff6e45e91e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8439e8564aafeab1172896d399134ff6e45e91e0/0_201_2400_2999/800.jpg\" alt=\"Black and white image of blonde woman, her hair tied back, looking perhaps apprehensively at viewer\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Helene Schjerfbeck in the early 1890s</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Copyright Unknown</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even on a spring visit to Helsinki, where I travel to retrace Schjerfbeck\u2019s steps, winter is never far off: icebreakers are sighted offshore and the handsome, stone apartments look built to withstand the cold (Schjerfbeck\u2019s studio was high up in one of these buildings). In the early 19th century, fire destroyed medieval Helsinki \u2013 most buildings in the city are post-1819. And it is in the classical Ateneum, built in 1887, that an archivist shows me Schjerfbeck\u2019s childhood sketchbooks with their humble, brown covers, full of astonishingly precocious drawings: delicate pencilled landscapes, gentle hands, painstakingly reproduced horses. On their final pages, like many a schoolchild with grand ideas, she rehearses her signature. Hs and Ss flourish their way into the future. The sense is that, even at this stage, she knew where she was going.</p> <p>Schjerfbeck\u2019s talent was spotted by a teacher when she was 11 and she won a scholarship to join the drawing school of Helsinki\u2019s Finnish Art Society. Two years later, when she was 13, her father died of tuberculosis. The family had never been well off \u2013 Svante Schjerfbeck had started as a merchant, gone bankrupt, and became the office manager of a railway engineering workshop. His death devastated the family. Olga, Helene\u2019s mother, took in lodgers \u2013 and sewing \u2013 to make ends meet but never thought art a suitable career for her daughter. It was her father who had always been Helene\u2019s great supporter.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Olga wished her daughter would dabble rather than devote herself to painting \u2013 art got in the way of housework</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Fortunately, there were others who wanted to help. Finland had been part of Sweden until it was annexed in 1809 by Russia and did not become independent until 1917. And, as Helene became a teenager, the country was recruiting talent to establish a national identity through art. She was granted a further scholarship to study oil painting at the academy of German-born painter Adolf von Becker from 1877 to 1880. At 16, too young to show her work in Paris, she studied plein-air realism and history painting and, in 1879, produced the painting that would launch her career.</p> <p><em>Wounded Warrior in the Snow</em> (in the Ateneum\u2019s collection) is formidably accomplished for a 17-year-old, remarkable for its (albeit carefully staged) naturalism. The military subject treated in a non-bellicose way was a rarity. And female artists at this time were more likely to be turning out floral still lifes. This is a still life of another sort: against a snowy silver birch a soldier slumps, a rifle in his left hand, his booted legs outstretched, no help in sight. It is possible to make out tiny figures to the right of the canvas, but whether they are advancing or retreating, it is hard to say. It is said that Schjerfbeck was painting her own situation \u2013 abandoned by her teacher and older students as they went off to exhibit in Paris without her. If this was the case, it is pleasing to discover that this painting about abandonment would secure her a grant from the Finnish senate to travel eventually to Paris, on a Kiel steamer then onwards by train.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f6494c22e711dc148816762f270a43bae878f185\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6494c22e711dc148816762f270a43bae878f185/37_59_2945_3576/824.jpg\" alt=\"Helene Schjerfbeck, Shadow on the Wall (Breton Landscape), 1883.\" width=\"824\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Helene Schjerfbeck, Shadow on the Wall (Breton Landscape), 1883.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Niemist\u00f6 Collection; photo: Finnish National Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Throughout her life, Paris remained her dream city. There she lived the life of an artist: slept in a garret, worked hard and made lifelong friendships with Helena Westermarck, Maria Wiik and Ada Thil\u00e9n, whom she called <em>m\u00e5larsystrarna</em>, her \u201cpainter sisters\u201d. And, over a 10-year period, she went on to work in Brittany, Florence and St Ives in Cornwall.</p> <p>It was in St Ives that Schjerfbeck produced her most popular work, <em>The</em> <em>Convalescent</em> (1888). But the background to this painting is a story she never wanted told. A modern biographer would struggle with Schjerfbeck \u2013 she left so much to the imagination (no wonder she is the subject of several Finnish novels, and \u2013 next year \u2013 both <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-r-ZVc7QWg\" title=\"\">a film</a> and <a href=\"https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/opera_film_on_artist_helene_schjerfbeck_due_in_2020/10733885)\" title=\"\">an opera</a>). All that is known, from family records that have, against the odds, survived is that between 1883 and 1884, her heart was broken. Her lover was an artist, damningly referred to in Finland as \u201cthe Englishman\u201d (although some academics, I\u2019m pleased to report, now maintain he was Swedish). They met in Pont-Aven in Brittany (might he, after all, have been French?). Whatever his nationality, no one now knows his name. He wrote a letter to Helene calling off their engagement, justifying himself by saying she was not, in his opinion, strong enough to bear his children. She destroyed the letter and asked friends \u2013 who wholeheartedly complied \u2013 to burn any correspondence in which his name was mentioned. She would never have children and although it is said she wished she could adopt, she feared she might not be physically strong enough (might the Englishman have been to blame?).</p> <p>His defection was the reason behind her trip to St Ives to stay with her friends, the painters Adrian Scott Stokes and Marianne Preindisberger Stokes (she had become friends with the latter in Paris). <em>The Convalescent</em> was the result. A small girl, with tousled hair, leans forward in a wicker chair, half-wrapped in a sheet. On the table in front of her is a sprig, starting to sprout, in a blue-and-white mug. Books prop each other up on the shelves behind her. The feeling is of absolute quiet, of fevered trance. The child is lost in the artist\u2019s world. Recovery, not decline, is the subject. The six-year-old is said to have been so lively that her teacher was delighted to offload her on to Schjerfbeck for sittings.</p> <p>To a modern eye, the painting seems traditional but, first presented in Finland, it was deemed, according to Anna-Maria von Bonsdorff, \u201ctoo modern, not polished enough, too French\u201d. Unsurprisingly, the French liked it: it won a bronze medal in Paris and was bought by the Ateneum and has been a favourite with gallery-goers ever since. Anna-Maria von Bonsdorff says: \u201cIt is the subject that draws people because it is about hope \u2013 an unusually positive picture in modern art.\u201d</p> <p>She contrasts it favourably with Munch\u2019s <em>The</em><em> Sick Child</em> (1907), a painting of his sister who died of tuberculosis.

She did not speak much Finnish herself (many people on the south-west coast of Finland have Swedish as their mother tongue). There is a famous photograph of her taken in Eken\u00e4s park \u2013 the only image in which she is smiling. It is not an established smile; you can see the photographer must have coaxed her into it.

But perhaps the most incongruous of her enthusiasms \u2013 given her seriousness \u2013 was for fashion. She adored French fashion magazines, flapper dresses, hats worn at a jaunty angle. She bought clothes, mail order, from Galeries Lafayette in Paris. From the photographs, you can see she wore knock-\u2019em-dead garb especially during the period during which she first knew Einar.

Scherfbeck\u2019s fashion plates go deep. Another striking painting is of her favourite model, Dora Estlander: <em>Elegant Lady</em> (1928). She has a chic androgyny: a curious, greenish complexion, a tiny daub of rouge on her left cheekbone, a hangdog droop to her features, a fashionably elongated giraffe neck, a look of mild consternation at being herself. It is a painting that gestures in Modigliani\u2019s direction. Schjerfbeck never painted a commissioned portrait. Her models were people she knew: her landlord, her landlord\u2019s children, local women, her mother, herself.

As guest curator Jeremy Lewison writes, she started \u201cfavouring memory over direct observation and the general over the particular\u201d.</p> <p>Some of the extraordinary late still lifes coming to the Royal Academy verge on the abstract. In <em>Still-life with Blackening Apples</em> (1944), ripeness is not all \u2013 the fruit on the right hand side is black already \u2013 fruit only just holding its own as fruit. There is a life-and-death beauty to it, an unexpected brilliance. One acidly green apple is startlingly reflected by the surface upon which it lies. It asks for only the smallest of imaginative leaps to link these still lifes with the late self-portraits. \u201cWe always hang them together,\u201d says von Bonsdorff. \u201cSchjerfbeck said, more than once, that when she became too involved with a portrait, she would break off to do a still life. She found a freedom in still lifes that allowed her to return to people.\u201d</p> <p>This simplicity is at its most extreme and moving in her last self-portrait \u2013 a charcoal sketch made in 1945. It is a memento mori, a drawing that looks like a carving. Her face has been reduced to the most essential version of itself, made as if with the strokes of a knife. The mouth is a single line, the eyes unreadable \u2013 the portrait is a closing down, the ultimate still life. Helene Schjerfbeck at once acknowledges death and defies it in work she must have known would survive her.</p> <p><em>The <a href=\"https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/helene-schjerfbeck\" title=\"\">Helene Schjerfbeck</a> exhibition is at the Royal Academy of Arts, London, from 20 July to 27 October.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "In the seaside town of Eken\u00e4s, south-west of Helsinki, there is a name that appears wherever you go: Helene Schjerfbeck. A street lined with early-19th-century weatherboard houses is named after her, and at the Helene Schjerfbeck cafe they serve lingonberry and bitter chocolate cake with the initials HS picked out in sugar. An actor, Anne Ingman, has made it her vocation to impersonate Schjerfbeck in a floor-length black costume with a battered leather handbag and a jade brooch like one Schjerfbeck wore. She guides visitors through a park where Schjerfbeck painted, tells stories about her life and points out a modern artwork by AK Dolven, a bell high in the oak trees that can be heard across town. Send not to know for whom the bell tolls: it is another homage to Schjerfbeck. In Helsinki\u2019s Ateneum, Finland\u2019s national gallery, Schjerfbeck (1862-1946) has been, through the latter part of her lifetime and since her death, one of Finland\u2019s best-loved artists. But in the UK she remains little known. This month, at the Royal Academy, a solo show of 65 paintings (she made more than 1,000 in her lifetime) is about to put this right. Schjerfbeck started in the style of French naturalists such as Jules Bastien-Lepage before becoming an early modernist. She is sometimes described, according to the Ateneum\u2019s chief curator and co-curator of the Royal Academy show Anna-Maria von Bonsdorff, as \u201cFinland\u2019s Munch\u201d, though at the same time she is \u201cindividual \u2013 distinctively herself\u201d and not as histrionic as her Norwegian counterpart. Royal Academy assistant curator Rebecca Bray suggests that through the \u201cintimacy and interiority\u201d in her work, she has more in common with the Danish painter Vilhelm Hammersh\u00f8i, sharing his melancholic grace. Schjerfbeck was single-minded, ambitious, tending to the reclusive and yet a chic dresser with a keen interest in fashion. Her self-portraits are her most extraordinary achievement and she painted these throughout her life. She would underplay their relevance, breezily observing that they were produced for convenience (she was, after all, always available as a model). Von Bonsdorff laughs at this, sees it as a self-protective evasion \u2013 Schjerfbeck did not want to be an object of scrutiny and was determined to discourage curious visitors. But her self-portraits are an inquiry into mortality. They put her in the company of Goya, Rembrandt, Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud. The self-portraits painted towards the end of her life, when she was dying of cancer in a sanatorium, show an understanding that a person is made up of everything they have ever been: she detects a youthfulness within age. By the time she is painting Green Self-Portrait: Light and Shadows (1945), you can see that dust will soon follow: the skull beneath the skin is visible, the shadow of death. Through the dissolution of precise features, she paints a ghost of her former self. The power in these paintings, says Bray, is the sense of \u201ccoming face to face with the interior of someone who is very ill and yet, at the same time, has a continuing will to work\u201d. Their inwardness fascinates: Schjerfbeck frequently paints herself (and others) with an averted gaze \u2013 the eyes escaping towards the skirting board or into the corners of a room. The displaced intensity is reminiscent of lines from an Emily Dickinson poem: \u201cI cannot live with You \u2013 It would be Life \u2013 And Life is over there \u2013 Behind the Shelf.\u201d The sense is that what matters is at an angle, at one remove \u2013 elsewhere. Von Bonsdorff says Schjerfbeck never explained her preference for the averted gaze but believes it to be, in part, a further illustration of her need for privacy. In 1915, the Ateneum commissioned a self-portrait for an exhibition after a period during which she had felt ignored by the establishment. She was pleased to be the only female artist invited to participate (she was not a militant feminist but supported women\u2019s suffrage \u2013 Finland was the first European country to give women the vote). In the resulting painting (used on the poster for the Royal Academy show), she has daubed herself with rouge and positioned a vermilion paint pot beside her. Her name is on the canvas, Holbein-style. It is a wan, authoritative and unnerving piece. Helene Schjerfbeck was born on 10 July 1862 in Helsinki. It is said that her artistic life began when, aged four, she fell down the front steps of the family\u2019s house and broke her hip. It was a bad break, inexpertly set, and left her with a limp for life. But it was while she was convalescing that her father gave her pencils and she started to draw. She later said: \u201cWhen you give a child a pencil, you give her an entire world.\u201d In her case, it was true and her talent would soon prove impossible to ignore. Even on a spring visit to Helsinki, where I travel to retrace Schjerfbeck\u2019s steps, winter is never far off: icebreakers are sighted offshore and the handsome, stone apartments look built to withstand the cold (Schjerfbeck\u2019s studio was high up in one of these buildings). In the early 19th century, fire destroyed medieval Helsinki \u2013 most buildings in the city are post-1819. And it is in the classical Ateneum, built in 1887, that an archivist shows me Schjerfbeck\u2019s childhood sketchbooks with their humble, brown covers, full of astonishingly precocious drawings: delicate pencilled landscapes, gentle hands, painstakingly reproduced horses. On their final pages, like many a schoolchild with grand ideas, she rehearses her signature. Hs and Ss flourish their way into the future. The sense is that, even at this stage, she knew where she was going. Schjerfbeck\u2019s talent was spotted by a teacher when she was 11 and she won a scholarship to join the drawing school of Helsinki\u2019s Finnish Art Society. Two years later, when she was 13, her father died of tuberculosis. The family had never been well off \u2013 Svante Schjerfbeck had started as a merchant, gone bankrupt, and became the office manager of a railway engineering workshop. His death devastated the family. Olga, Helene\u2019s mother, took in lodgers \u2013 and sewing \u2013 to make ends meet but never thought art a suitable career for her daughter. It was her father who had always been Helene\u2019s great supporter. Fortunately, there were others who wanted to help. Finland had been part of Sweden until it was annexed in 1809 by Russia and did not become independent until 1917. And, as Helene became a teenager, the country was recruiting talent to establish a national identity through art. She was granted a further scholarship to study oil painting at the academy of German-born painter Adolf von Becker from 1877 to 1880. At 16, too young to show her work in Paris, she studied plein-air realism and history painting and, in 1879, produced the painting that would launch her career. Wounded Warrior in the Snow (in the Ateneum\u2019s collection) is formidably accomplished for a 17-year-old, remarkable for its (albeit carefully staged) naturalism. The military subject treated in a non-bellicose way was a rarity. And female artists at this time were more likely to be turning out floral still lifes. This is a still life of another sort: against a snowy silver birch a soldier slumps, a rifle in his left hand, his booted legs outstretched, no help in sight. It is possible to make out tiny figures to the right of the canvas, but whether they are advancing or retreating, it is hard to say. It is said that Schjerfbeck was painting her own situation \u2013 abandoned by her teacher and older students as they went off to exhibit in Paris without her. If this was the case, it is pleasing to discover that this painting about abandonment would secure her a grant from the Finnish senate to travel eventually to Paris, on a Kiel steamer then onwards by train. Throughout her life, Paris remained her dream city. There she lived the life of an artist: slept in a garret, worked hard and made lifelong friendships with Helena Westermarck, Maria Wiik and Ada Thil\u00e9n, whom she called m\u00e5larsystrarna, her \u201cpainter sisters\u201d. And, over a 10-year period, she went on to work in Brittany, Florence and St Ives in Cornwall. It was in St Ives that Schjerfbeck produced her most popular work, The Convalescent (1888). But the background to this painting is a story she never wanted told. A modern biographer would struggle with Schjerfbeck \u2013 she left so much to the imagination (no wonder she is the subject of several Finnish novels, and \u2013 next year \u2013 both a film and an opera). All that is known, from family records that have, against the odds, survived is that between 1883 and 1884, her heart was broken. Her lover was an artist, damningly referred to in Finland as \u201cthe Englishman\u201d (although some academics, I\u2019m pleased to report, now maintain he was Swedish). They met in Pont-Aven in Brittany (might he, after all, have been French?). Whatever his nationality, no one now knows his name. He wrote a letter to Helene calling off their engagement, justifying himself by saying she was not, in his opinion, strong enough to bear his children. She destroyed the letter and asked friends \u2013 who wholeheartedly complied \u2013 to burn any correspondence in which his name was mentioned. She would never have children and although it is said she wished she could adopt, she feared she might not be physically strong enough (might the Englishman have been to blame?). His defection was the reason behind her trip to St Ives to stay with her friends, the painters Adrian Scott Stokes and Marianne Preindisberger Stokes (she had become friends with the latter in Paris). The Convalescent was the result. A small girl, with tousled hair, leans forward in a wicker chair, half-wrapped in a sheet. On the table in front of her is a sprig, starting to sprout, in a blue-and-white mug. Books prop each other up on the shelves behind her. The feeling is of absolute quiet, of fevered trance. The child is lost in the artist\u2019s world. Recovery, not decline, is the subject. The six-year-old is said to have been so lively that her teacher was delighted to offload her on to Schjerfbeck for sittings. To a modern eye, the painting seems traditional but, first presented in Finland, it was deemed, according to Anna-Maria von Bonsdorff, \u201ctoo modern, not polished enough, too French\u201d. Unsurprisingly, the French liked it: it won a bronze medal in Paris and was bought by the Ateneum and has been a favourite with gallery-goers ever since. Anna-Maria von Bonsdorff says: \u201cIt is the subject that draws people because it is about hope \u2013 an unusually positive picture in modern art.\u201d She contrasts it favourably with Munch\u2019s The Sick Child (1907), a painting of his sister who died of tuberculosis. Schjerfbeck\u2019s patient has a playful eye. Might the painting be autobiographical twice over \u2013 referring not only to recovery from a painful affair but to Schjerfbeck\u2019s own childhood convalescence? At the age of 30, Schjerfbeck boosted her income copying masterpieces for museums (finding inspiration in the work of Holbein, el Greco, Diego Vel\u00e1zquez). And, in time, the influential gallerist and art dealer G\u00f6sta Stenman gave her a small salary in return for free access to her work. Her financial affairs were managed by her brother Magnus (not always to her liking), and she taught for two years at the Art Society drawing school. Her students appreciated her but she disliked teaching and was relieved, in 1902, to move to Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4, a town 30 miles north of Helsinki, to look after her mother. It is impossible to look at the portraits of Schjerfbeck\u2019s mother painted in Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4 (three are on show at the Royal Academy) without speculating about their relationship. Olga lost a child before Helene was born and, it seems, never bonded with her daughter. In the 1902 portrait, Olga sits in a rocking chair outdoing Whistler\u2019s mother (Schjerfbeck knew and admired Whistler but did not like being compared with him). You can barely see her face \u2013 you can just make out the rim of her glasses. She is reading, ominously enough, what appears to be a blank book. Were she offering us a message, it might be that she has better things to do than catch our eye. Olga wished her daughter would dabble rather than devote herself to painting \u2013 art got in the way of housework. But the Schjerfbecks had the luxury of a maid and neither mother nor daughter cooked. Errand boys and girls were dispatched to bring home meals from the railway station restaurant \u2013 early 20th-century takeaways. After her mother\u2019s death in 1923, Schjerfbeck moved to Eken\u00e4s. She chose Eken\u00e4s (Tammisaari to Finnish-speakers) because she had aunts there and the town was Swedish-speaking.

As guest curator Jeremy Lewison writes, she started \u201cfavouring memory over direct observation and the general over the particular\u201d. Some of the extraordinary late still lifes coming to the Royal Academy verge on the abstract. In Still-life with Blackening Apples (1944), ripeness is not all \u2013 the fruit on the right hand side is black already \u2013 fruit only just holding its own as fruit. There is a life-and-death beauty to it, an unexpected brilliance. One acidly green apple is startlingly reflected by the surface upon which it lies. It asks for only the smallest of imaginative leaps to link these still lifes with the late self-portraits. \u201cWe always hang them together,\u201d says von Bonsdorff. \u201cSchjerfbeck said, more than once, that when she became too involved with a portrait, she would break off to do a still life. She found a freedom in still lifes that allowed her to return to people.\u201d This simplicity is at its most extreme and moving in her last self-portrait \u2013 a charcoal sketch made in 1945. It is a memento mori, a drawing that looks like a carving. Her face has been reduced to the most essential version of itself, made as if with the strokes of a knife. The mouth is a single line, the eyes unreadable \u2013 the portrait is a closing down, the ultimate still life. Helene Schjerfbeck at once acknowledges death and defies it in work she must have known would survive her. The Helene Schjerfbeck exhibition is at the Royal Academy of Arts, London, from 20 July to 27 October.",

      "body": "<p>Jean Paul Gaultier, a man of many notable achievements, including the perfect and most welcome corruption of the minds of kids who furtively watched late-night Channel 4 during the 1990s, has spoken about the responsibility of big fashion brands <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-48824250\" title=\"\">when it comes to waste</a>. \u201cBig groups are doing more collections, new collections\u2026 with a big amount of clothes. It\u2019s absolutely ridiculous,\u201d he told BBC News. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of thinking about what people need. It\u2019s thinking about being bigger. It\u2019s only a question of power and politics.\u201d</p> <p>We hear over and over again that our addiction to consumption is causing environmental devastation, that the incessant need for more, quicker, bigger is hastening our demise as a planet, and that\u2019s just the kind of upbeat conversation that I have in the pub when trying to lift the mood after England\u2019s semi-final defeat to USA. (*Sips tea, cries.*)</p> <p>Yes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/jun/18/ministers-reject-charge-of-1p-an-item-to-clean-up-fast-fashion\" title=\"\">fast fashion is a disaster</a>, and of course we should be horrified at the human cost of a T-shirt that\u2019s being sold for \u00a34. But big brands <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-44885983\" title=\"\">burning millions of pounds worth of excess stock</a> have something to answer for, too.</p> <p>So often, the responsibility to change seems to fall upon people who do not have the financial flexibility it requires to even try to do better. When a person of Gaultier\u2019s stature and influence criticises his own side of the industry, it at least feels as if he\u2019s sharing that accountability between everyone. I\u2019ve lost count of the number of times I\u2019ve heard people suggesting that the fast-fashion crisis could be solved by people spending more, but buying less.</p> <p>It is a worthy notion, but also impractical. It suggests to me that this is someone who does not understand what it is like to be watching every penny. It\u2019s the kind of solution that would work if money arrived in bulk once a year, to be portioned out with a single January splurge on a built-to-last pair of trousers that cost \u00a3700, but won\u2019t end up in landfill in six months. I also wonder if the \u201cbuy one thing that will last\u201d types have ever needed to be glad that a supermarket school uniform can be squeaked out of a tight weekly budget.</p> <p>By airing his views with the precision of a conical bra, Gaultier is helping to make the point that everyone should play a part. I was also a fan of his suggestion of what to do next. \u201cKeep your clothes\u2026 and after, we can make something new. I will help you do that,\u201d he said.</p> <h2>Sigrid, making one fan\u2019s dream come true<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e1bea158ae6835d8da5fcaa6401c2e37f675734\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e1bea158ae6835d8da5fcaa6401c2e37f675734/0_6_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sigrid at the Glastonbury festival\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sigrid at the Glastonbury festival, where she acknowledged 13-year-old Nina as her biggest fan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yui Mok/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On an ordinary night, at an ordinary gig, you might turn up, queue for a bit and navigate a jumble of sweaty bodies in order to pay tribute at the feet of your musical idols. Or, in the case of Beyonc\u00e9 at Cardiff\u2019s Principality Stadium, enter into a kind of unspoken who-knows-more-lyrics competition with the dressed-to-kill women in the next row along, who, sadly, were victorious, and deserved their triumph.</p> <p>But last week was a big one for music fans living out the kind of fairytales that Richard Curtis would carve into a sweet romcom in a heartbeat. First, there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/01/alex-mann-the-teenage-rap-fan-who-lit-up-glastonbury\" title=\"\">Alex</a>, the 15-year-old pulled from the crowd at Glastonbury by Dave, whose show he accidentally stole with a perfect rendition of the track Thiago Silva, and who became internet-famous overnight.</p> <p>Then there was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-48865029\" title=\"\">13-year-old Nina</a>, who sobbed through Sigrid\u2019s set at the same festival, prompting the singer to call her \u201cthe biggest legend of them all\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Jean Paul Gaultier, a man of many notable achievements, including the perfect and most welcome corruption of the minds of kids who furtively watched late-night Channel 4 during the 1990s, has spoken about the responsibility of big fashion brands when it comes to waste. \u201cBig groups are doing more collections, new collections\u2026 with a big amount of clothes. It\u2019s absolutely ridiculous,\u201d he told BBC News. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of thinking about what people need. It\u2019s thinking about being bigger. It\u2019s only a question of power and politics.\u201d We hear over and over again that our addiction to consumption is causing environmental devastation, that the incessant need for more, quicker, bigger is hastening our demise as a planet, and that\u2019s just the kind of upbeat conversation that I have in the pub when trying to lift the mood after England\u2019s semi-final defeat to USA. (*Sips tea, cries.*) Yes, fast fashion is a disaster, and of course we should be horrified at the human cost of a T-shirt that\u2019s being sold for \u00a34. But big brands burning millions of pounds worth of excess stock have something to answer for, too. So often, the responsibility to change seems to fall upon people who do not have the financial flexibility it requires to even try to do better. When a person of Gaultier\u2019s stature and influence criticises his own side of the industry, it at least feels as if he\u2019s sharing that accountability between everyone. I\u2019ve lost count of the number of times I\u2019ve heard people suggesting that the fast-fashion crisis could be solved by people spending more, but buying less. It is a worthy notion, but also impractical. It suggests to me that this is someone who does not understand what it is like to be watching every penny. It\u2019s the kind of solution that would work if money arrived in bulk once a year, to be portioned out with a single January splurge on a built-to-last pair of trousers that cost \u00a3700, but won\u2019t end up in landfill in six months. I also wonder if the \u201cbuy one thing that will last\u201d types have ever needed to be glad that a supermarket school uniform can be squeaked out of a tight weekly budget. By airing his views with the precision of a conical bra, Gaultier is helping to make the point that everyone should play a part. I was also a fan of his suggestion of what to do next. \u201cKeep your clothes\u2026 and after, we can make something new. I will help you do that,\u201d he said. Sigrid, making one fan\u2019s dream come true On an ordinary night, at an ordinary gig, you might turn up, queue for a bit and navigate a jumble of sweaty bodies in order to pay tribute at the feet of your musical idols. Or, in the case of Beyonc\u00e9 at Cardiff\u2019s Principality Stadium, enter into a kind of unspoken who-knows-more-lyrics competition with the dressed-to-kill women in the next row along, who, sadly, were victorious, and deserved their triumph. But last week was a big one for music fans living out the kind of fairytales that Richard Curtis would carve into a sweet romcom in a heartbeat. First, there was Alex, the 15-year-old pulled from the crowd at Glastonbury by Dave, whose show he accidentally stole with a perfect rendition of the track Thiago Silva, and who became internet-famous overnight. Then there was 13-year-old Nina, who sobbed through Sigrid\u2019s set at the same festival, prompting the singer to call her \u201cthe biggest legend of them all\u201d. Sigrid has since invited Nina to meet her at Latitude festival. Shawn Mendes, meanwhile, shared a clip of himself kissing \u201ca little angel\u201d in the crowd at a show in Denver, and that little angel appears to have had the night of her life. I\u2019m looking forward to a book out this month, called Fangirls (disclosure: the author is a friend, but I\u2019d have recommended it anyway), which explores the world of female teenage music fans who dedicate their lives to the likes of Lady Gaga or One Direction. It treats fandom as a serious business and, as last week showed, the business of being a fan can reap unimaginable and brilliant rewards. Hugh Grant, not everyone wants his photo Hugh Grant found himself defending his wife against a paparazzo in Rome, taking the woman\u2019s phone away when she dared to take it out in his vicinity.

      "body": "<p>The World Cup final is not just another game. You sometimes hear players say polite things like \u201cI\u2019m just going to take one game at a time\u201d but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. In my experience, before a final, you know that you\u2019re only one game away from reaching the absolute pinnacle of your sport. Everything that you have left inside you and everything you haven\u2019t even yet used is about to be put on display in that final match. You don\u2019t want to let this opportunity slip away. You get more excited; you have more nerves; you feel more pressure; you\u2019re finally in the place that you have wanted to be since forever. </p> <p>I won three Olympic gold medals but, for me, the World Cup is the peak of football. We lost the final on penalties in 2011, and in 2015 there was a good chance that it wasn\u2019t going to happen for us again. That would have been harsh on players like Abby Wambach and Christie Rampone who were close to retiring and I knew, too, that I would not be satisfied with my career if I didn\u2019t hold the World Cup in my hands.</p> <p>Looking back, I\u2019m so glad to have had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jul/18/japan-usa-womens-world-cup-final\">the experience of losing the 2011 final</a> even though it was heartbreaking. Japan were playing for something bigger than the game itself that year \u2013 for the morale of the country <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/24/the-school-beneath-the-wave-the-unimaginable-tragedy-of-japans-tsunami\">after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami</a>. Many of Japan\u2019s players had been affected personally by the events. That context was something I\u2019d never experienced before. It was tragically beautiful to see their players come together and lift up their country. I\u2019m proud that I was part of a game that transcended the sport. It\u2019s still very emotional to think about it. That said, in the same breath, my competitive nature will tell you that we made some defensive errors in that game that I will never forget. You may think you are the better team but it just takes one second for things to turn against you. It was a game where I grew both as a person and a player.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/05/usa-womens-world-cup-soccer\">The last hurrah? USA have blazed the trail but Europe is closing in</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a final it might be great to say that you are playing for the Stars and Stripes on your chest but you\u2019re also playing for family members, coaches, and everyone who made sacrifices to help get you to that point. It can get very personal and everyone has a story. I played in the 2007 World Cup after the loss of my best friend and my father. That was a way of mourning both of them \u2013 I wanted to make them proud. So many players have challenges they are going through and a game like this can have added significance and meaning.</p> <p>Some coaches are great at big speeches before the game or at half-time. Jill Ellis will do the Xs and Os and tactics but she\u2019s not the type of coach who is a big motivator. Motivation doesn\u2019t always come from a coach anyway. During the 2012 Olympics, I texted with Carli Lloyd and Heather Mitts on the bus on the way to the final. That was Heather\u2019s last tournament and we had a moment of reflection that brought some tears. It was a look back at our journey and everything we\u2019d gone through together and individually to get to that point.</p> <p>The lead up to the game can be very reflective and emotional. You have to embrace that and recognize the magnitude of the game. Motivation is mostly already inside an athlete at this level but others do help, often in timely and unforgettable ways. It can come from anyone: a personal trainer, a friend, or even a stranger. For for me in 2015 it came from my husband, a former NFL player, who understood the pressure of being a professional athlete and knew me better than anybody. He understood what I was going through and he was the only person who knew what to say or how to speak to me. He reminded me of my own strength and I felt untouchable. He was my ultimate teammate, and as with my US teammates, I didn\u2019t want to let him or myself down.</p> <p>You can feel the extra intensity on game day. People might be a little more quiet at breakfast or listen to music all day in the hotel while waiting for the bus to the stadium. That might seem relaxed but the atmosphere intensifies.

      "bodyText": "The World Cup final is not just another game. You sometimes hear players say polite things like \u201cI\u2019m just going to take one game at a time\u201d but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. In my experience, before a final, you know that you\u2019re only one game away from reaching the absolute pinnacle of your sport. Everything that you have left inside you and everything you haven\u2019t even yet used is about to be put on display in that final match. You don\u2019t want to let this opportunity slip away. You get more excited; you have more nerves; you feel more pressure; you\u2019re finally in the place that you have wanted to be since forever. I won three Olympic gold medals but, for me, the World Cup is the peak of football. We lost the final on penalties in 2011, and in 2015 there was a good chance that it wasn\u2019t going to happen for us again. That would have been harsh on players like Abby Wambach and Christie Rampone who were close to retiring and I knew, too, that I would not be satisfied with my career if I didn\u2019t hold the World Cup in my hands. Looking back, I\u2019m so glad to have had the experience of losing the 2011 final even though it was heartbreaking. Japan were playing for something bigger than the game itself that year \u2013 for the morale of the country after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Many of Japan\u2019s players had been affected personally by the events. That context was something I\u2019d never experienced before. It was tragically beautiful to see their players come together and lift up their country. I\u2019m proud that I was part of a game that transcended the sport. It\u2019s still very emotional to think about it. That said, in the same breath, my competitive nature will tell you that we made some defensive errors in that game that I will never forget. You may think you are the better team but it just takes one second for things to turn against you. It was a game where I grew both as a person and a player. In a final it might be great to say that you are playing for the Stars and Stripes on your chest but you\u2019re also playing for family members, coaches, and everyone who made sacrifices to help get you to that point. It can get very personal and everyone has a story. I played in the 2007 World Cup after the loss of my best friend and my father. That was a way of mourning both of them \u2013 I wanted to make them proud. So many players have challenges they are going through and a game like this can have added significance and meaning. Some coaches are great at big speeches before the game or at half-time. Jill Ellis will do the Xs and Os and tactics but she\u2019s not the type of coach who is a big motivator. Motivation doesn\u2019t always come from a coach anyway. During the 2012 Olympics, I texted with Carli Lloyd and Heather Mitts on the bus on the way to the final. That was Heather\u2019s last tournament and we had a moment of reflection that brought some tears. It was a look back at our journey and everything we\u2019d gone through together and individually to get to that point. The lead up to the game can be very reflective and emotional. You have to embrace that and recognize the magnitude of the game. Motivation is mostly already inside an athlete at this level but others do help, often in timely and unforgettable ways. It can come from anyone: a personal trainer, a friend, or even a stranger. For for me in 2015 it came from my husband, a former NFL player, who understood the pressure of being a professional athlete and knew me better than anybody. He understood what I was going through and he was the only person who knew what to say or how to speak to me. He reminded me of my own strength and I felt untouchable. He was my ultimate teammate, and as with my US teammates, I didn\u2019t want to let him or myself down. You can feel the extra intensity on game day. People might be a little more quiet at breakfast or listen to music all day in the hotel while waiting for the bus to the stadium. That might seem relaxed but the atmosphere intensifies. Abby Wambach was always the funniest on game day. She\u2019d never know what to do with her bottled up energy and would start nervously talking to everyone. It was so endearing that it became a huge in-joke among the team. She just wouldn\u2019t shut up. At game day mealtime she\u2019d come into the room and announce \u201cIt\u2019s a bad day to be Japanese!\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s a bad day to be Dutch!\u201d. She\u2019d get so amped up all day and then during the huddle on the pitch, right before kick off, she would be set to give one last motivational speech but would be so excited she would usually trip over her own words.

      "body": "<p>Last week\u2019s sudden outbreak of verbal hostilities with China, triggered by violent clashes in Hong Kong, provided a disturbing glimpse of post-Brexit Britain\u2019s isolated and impotent future in a world of more muscular adversaries. It also underlined a dilemma facing all the western democracies in their dealings with Beijing: what matters most \u2013 liberal values or money-making?</p> <p>Like bullies sensing weakness, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/03/foreign-office-calls-in-china-ambassador-over-hong-kong-protests\" title=\"\">Chinese officials let rip</a> after Britain dared defend the demonstrators\u2019 right to protest against the erosion of Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms. The row released tensions largely suppressed since the former colony was handed back in 1997. The depth of China\u2019s pent-up fury was cautionary.</p> <p>Liu Xiaoming, China\u2019s ambassador, led the charge, demanding Britain keep its \u201chands off Hong Kong\u201d. Liu misrepresented the foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt\u2019s public support for the protesters as implying support for violence. Another official was personally insulting, accusing Hunt of \u201cbasking in the faded glory of British colonialism\u201d.</p> <p>China\u2019s claim that Britain was surreptitiously fomenting unrest as part of a wider destabilisation conspiracy was classic Communist party propaganda-cum-paranoia. At the same time, Britain was mocked as an enfeebled, failing country, unable to manage its own internal problems. The obvious contradiction did not inhibit the rhetoric.</p> <p>These broadsides, intended to demonstrate proud resilience, spoke instead of abiding insecurity. Xi Jinping, China\u2019s \u201cstrongman\u201d leader and de facto president-for-life, is said to have been deeply influenced by the east European revolutions of 1989 and the subsequent implosion of the Soviet Union.</p> <p>Xi fears one-party China could go the same way. \u201cWhy did the Soviet Communist party collapse?\u201d Xi asked in 2013 when discussing the risks posed by popular insurrections. One reason, he said, was that \u201cnobody was a real man\u201d. That tough-guy Xi is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/03/world/asia/xi-jinping-hong-kong.html\" title=\"\">determined not to repeat Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s supposed mistakes</a> is already abundantly clear.</p> <p>His time in power since 2012 has been marked by expanding state control, a Mao-style personality cult reinforced by purges of party rivals (dressed up as anti-corruption drives), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/05/fake-news-china-dismisses-reports-about-detention-of-uighurs\" title=\"\">mass detentions and human rights abuses, pervasive censorship</a> and an aggressive foreign policy signalling China\u2019s ambitions as a global superpower.</p> <p>Hong Kong\u2019s demand for democratic self-determination directly contradicts Xi\u2019s vision of the unchallengeable power of the party and its \u201ccore leader\u201d. It threatens his ascendancy. Worse, it could encourage copycat resistance in mainland China, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/05/china-economy-target-cut-tough-struggle-ahead-li-keqiang\" title=\"\">public discontent exacerbated by an economic slowdown</a> is growing.</p> <p>That means more Hong Kong arrests and jailings. It means a slow-motion stifling of dissent, whatever Britain may say.

Deep-rooted anger at Britain has its origins in events largely forgotten in London but not in Beijing. It is true, as China says, that postwar colonial Britain showed scant regard for Hong Kong residents\u2019 rights. This indifference was consistent with earlier humiliations heaped on the ruling Qing dynasty by Victorian imperialists \u2013 the cause of China\u2019s \u201clost century\u201d, concluding in 1945.</p> <p>The first Anglo-Chinese opium war, from 1839-42, was supposedly a response to Chinese insults to Britain\u2019s national honour. In truth it was mostly about money and power, about imposing free trade, and about securing a lucrative market for opium exports from British India, regardless of the human cost.</p> <p>This destabilising intervention opened the gates to other foreign invaders and to decades of revolts, such as the Taiping rebellion, when <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_Rebellion\" title=\"\">up to 100 million people may have died</a>. It also foreshadowed an infamous act of cultural vandalism, the burning and looting by British and French forces of the emperor\u2019s wondrous Summer Palace in Beijing in 1860. Its Chinese name was Yuanmingyuan \u2013 \u201cgarden of perfect brightness\u201d. And it was utterly destroyed. All Chinese schoolchildren <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-30810596\" title=\"\">are taught this</a>.</p> <p>Hunt deplored Beijing\u2019s trashing of the 1984 Sino-British joint declaration, calling it an affront to the international rules-based order from which China benefits. But such righteous outrage comes awkwardly from a country that waged war in Iraq without legal authority and stays on friendly terms with murderers in Saudi Arabia. It ignores the lawless history of the pre-1914 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unequal_treaty\" title=\"\">\u201cunequal treaties\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Ironically, these old injustices were instrumental in shaping the Chinese communists\u2019 20th-century anti-imperialist, nationalist ideology \u2013 and the party\u2019s insistence on regaining sovereignty over \u201clost\u201d territories such as Hong Kong, Macau and, prospectively, Taiwan. As was often the case during its empire-building days, Britain sowed the seeds of its ultimate displacement.</p> <p>China\u2019s disdain, bordering on contempt, for Britain\u2019s warnings stems not only from London\u2019s past hypocrisy and historical amnesia, but also from a keen assessment of its current, palpable weakness. Given the gaping power imbalance, Hunt\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/04/jeremy-hunt-refuses-to-rule-out-sanctions-against-china\" title=\"\">threat of unspecified \u201csevere consequences\u201d</a> is all but meaningless.</p> <p>The reality is chastening. Britain will need a post-Brexit trade deal. It needs Chinese investment, technological expertise, and even Huawei (if the US allows). But China does not really need Britain. Acting alone from a position of relative dependency, Britain cannot by itself change China\u2019s behaviour or effectively promote its own values. That requires the sort of leverage only strong alliances bring. And since Donald Trump cannot be trusted, that means a united European front.</p> <p>But Europe is being recklessly shunted aside. Even as he claims Britain is still a country with \u201cglobal reach\u201d, Hunt (like Boris Johnson) is undermining British international leadership and influence.</p> <p>China\u2019s scorn is well deserved. Democracy in Hong Kong is set to become Brexit\u2019s first big overseas casualty.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Last week\u2019s sudden outbreak of verbal hostilities with China, triggered by violent clashes in Hong Kong, provided a disturbing glimpse of post-Brexit Britain\u2019s isolated and impotent future in a world of more muscular adversaries. It also underlined a dilemma facing all the western democracies in their dealings with Beijing: what matters most \u2013 liberal values or money-making? Like bullies sensing weakness, Chinese officials let rip after Britain dared defend the demonstrators\u2019 right to protest against the erosion of Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms. The row released tensions largely suppressed since the former colony was handed back in 1997. The depth of China\u2019s pent-up fury was cautionary. Liu Xiaoming, China\u2019s ambassador, led the charge, demanding Britain keep its \u201chands off Hong Kong\u201d. Liu misrepresented the foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt\u2019s public support for the protesters as implying support for violence. Another official was personally insulting, accusing Hunt of \u201cbasking in the faded glory of British colonialism\u201d. China\u2019s claim that Britain was surreptitiously fomenting unrest as part of a wider destabilisation conspiracy was classic Communist party propaganda-cum-paranoia. At the same time, Britain was mocked as an enfeebled, failing country, unable to manage its own internal problems. The obvious contradiction did not inhibit the rhetoric. These broadsides, intended to demonstrate proud resilience, spoke instead of abiding insecurity. Xi Jinping, China\u2019s \u201cstrongman\u201d leader and de facto president-for-life, is said to have been deeply influenced by the east European revolutions of 1989 and the subsequent implosion of the Soviet Union. Xi fears one-party China could go the same way. \u201cWhy did the Soviet Communist party collapse?\u201d Xi asked in 2013 when discussing the risks posed by popular insurrections. One reason, he said, was that \u201cnobody was a real man\u201d. That tough-guy Xi is determined not to repeat Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s supposed mistakes is already abundantly clear. His time in power since 2012 has been marked by expanding state control, a Mao-style personality cult reinforced by purges of party rivals (dressed up as anti-corruption drives), mass detentions and human rights abuses, pervasive censorship and an aggressive foreign policy signalling China\u2019s ambitions as a global superpower. Hong Kong\u2019s demand for democratic self-determination directly contradicts Xi\u2019s vision of the unchallengeable power of the party and its \u201ccore leader\u201d. It threatens his ascendancy. Worse, it could encourage copycat resistance in mainland China, where public discontent exacerbated by an economic slowdown is growing. That means more Hong Kong arrests and jailings. It means a slow-motion stifling of dissent, whatever Britain may say. And despite Thursday\u2019s limited offer of talks, it may yet mean direct rule from Beijing, short-circuiting the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula. \u201cNo one is in a position to dictate to the Chinese people,\u201d Xi proclaimed last December. \u201cThe party is everything.\u201d It\u2019s not all China\u2019s fault. Deep-rooted anger at Britain has its origins in events largely forgotten in London but not in Beijing. It is true, as China says, that postwar colonial Britain showed scant regard for Hong Kong residents\u2019 rights. This indifference was consistent with earlier humiliations heaped on the ruling Qing dynasty by Victorian imperialists \u2013 the cause of China\u2019s \u201clost century\u201d, concluding in 1945. The first Anglo-Chinese opium war, from 1839-42, was supposedly a response to Chinese insults to Britain\u2019s national honour. In truth it was mostly about money and power, about imposing free trade, and about securing a lucrative market for opium exports from British India, regardless of the human cost. This destabilising intervention opened the gates to other foreign invaders and to decades of revolts, such as the Taiping rebellion, when up to 100 million people may have died. It also foreshadowed an infamous act of cultural vandalism, the burning and looting by British and French forces of the emperor\u2019s wondrous Summer Palace in Beijing in 1860. Its Chinese name was Yuanmingyuan \u2013 \u201cgarden of perfect brightness\u201d. And it was utterly destroyed. All Chinese schoolchildren are taught this. Hunt deplored Beijing\u2019s trashing of the 1984 Sino-British joint declaration, calling it an affront to the international rules-based order from which China benefits. But such righteous outrage comes awkwardly from a country that waged war in Iraq without legal authority and stays on friendly terms with murderers in Saudi Arabia. It ignores the lawless history of the pre-1914 \u201cunequal treaties\u201d. Ironically, these old injustices were instrumental in shaping the Chinese communists\u2019 20th-century anti-imperialist, nationalist ideology \u2013 and the party\u2019s insistence on regaining sovereignty over \u201clost\u201d territories such as Hong Kong, Macau and, prospectively, Taiwan. As was often the case during its empire-building days, Britain sowed the seeds of its ultimate displacement. China\u2019s disdain, bordering on contempt, for Britain\u2019s warnings stems not only from London\u2019s past hypocrisy and historical amnesia, but also from a keen assessment of its current, palpable weakness. Given the gaping power imbalance, Hunt\u2019s threat of unspecified \u201csevere consequences\u201d is all but meaningless. The reality is chastening. Britain will need a post-Brexit trade deal. It needs Chinese investment, technological expertise, and even Huawei (if the US allows). But China does not really need Britain. Acting alone from a position of relative dependency, Britain cannot by itself change China\u2019s behaviour or effectively promote its own values. That requires the sort of leverage only strong alliances bring. And since Donald Trump cannot be trusted, that means a united European front. But Europe is being recklessly shunted aside. Even as he claims Britain is still a country with \u201cglobal reach\u201d, Hunt (like Boris Johnson) is undermining British international leadership and influence. China\u2019s scorn is well deserved. Democracy in Hong Kong is set to become Brexit\u2019s first big overseas casualty.",

      "body": "<p>The stage is set like a hotel bedroom where a scantily clad woman is hiding inside a wardrobe and a man\u2019s socked foot sticks out from under the bed. At the sound of an unexpected knock at the door the whole audience knows exactly where they are: safe in the land of farce, where life is even more complicated than the real thing and the frantic pace of the action will build until the final curtain.</p> <p>This summer the time-honoured tradition of broad stage comedy is back in the West End with a vengeance. A series of acclaimed new productions, including a whirlwind re-working of No\u00ebl Coward\u2019s <em>Present Laughter</em> at the Old Vic and a new revival at the Lyric Hammersmith of Michael Frayn\u2019s <em>Noises Off</em> \u2013 a 1982 farce about putting on a farce \u2013 have both now joined the hugely successful show <em>The Play that Goes Wrong</em> as a new generation of theatregoers discovers the joy of pure farce.</p> <p>Playwright Jenny Selway, whose own new farce, <em>Flat Out</em>, has just closed after a critically acclaimed run, is delighted to see the genre return in triumph. \u201cIt\u2019s the cruellest, most delicious humour,\u201d she said this weekend.</p> <p>But Selway is unsure if the current boom is a response to the gloomy political mood or simply driven by the fact that writers and producers have worked out how to revive the form without the stereotypes.</p> <p>\u201cAre we suddenly keen on staging farces because we\u2019re living through such serious times? It sounds neat, but times are usually serious,\u201d Selway said. \u201cIt is true, though, that there\u2019s an absurdity about today\u2019s politics, including identity politics, and farce does chime with that.\u201d</p> <p>During the original London heyday of the genre in the 1960s, 70s and 80s, popular shows such as Brian Rix\u2019s Whitehall farces and Ray Cooney\u2019s <em>Run for your Wife</em> were all littered with misunderstandings and missing trousers. But 1980s farces with jokes at the expense of dumb blondes or gay men would not play well now.</p> <p>\u201cIn <em>Flat Out</em> I wanted to find comedy in today\u2019s obsessions and preoccupations and still have people taking their clothes off and hiding in cupboards,\u201d said Selway, who also believes farce should not be classed as \u201clight comedy\u201d, since the dramatis personae are all usually \u201chaving the worst day of their lives\u201d. Even Coward\u2019s witty 1939 comedy <em>Present Laughter</em>, which stars Andrew Scott as the egotistical actor at its centre, has been updated for 2019 with a gender change in one of the love affairs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9ca726cc9f93e5e01d1ce11fbeafb769a116b07a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ca726cc9f93e5e01d1ce11fbeafb769a116b07a/0_42_4483_2690/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Debra Gillett, Jonathan Cullen and Meera Syal in Noises Off by Michael Frayn at the Lyric Hammersmith.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Debra Gillett, Jonathan Cullen and Meera Syal in Noises Off by Michael Frayn at the Lyric Hammersmith.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While the new productions are generally more politically aware, they are doing such roaring box office business that two spin-off stage shows, <em>The Comedy About A Bank Robbery</em> and <em>Peter Pan Goes Wrong</em>, from the team behind <em>The Play that Goes Wrong</em>, are also drawing in big West End crowds. The film director JJ Abrams, the comedian Peter Kay and the American magicians Penn &amp; Teller are among ardent fans of these shows. And a <em>Goes Wrong</em> television series based on the franchise is currently being filmed in front of audiences in Manchester, ready to come to small screens this autumn.</p> <p>After two television specials that guest starred Diana Rigg and Derek Jacobi, the BBC has commissioned six half-hour stories that will see the ill-fated Cornley Drama Society undertake another ambitious production, as well as a courtroom drama and a second world war spy thriller.</p> <p>The term \u201cfarce\u201d comes from the Latin \u201cto stuff\u201d, and a typical plot is packed with twists, puns, concealments and increasingly rapid entrances and exits. As a result, farce has often been scorned as a vulgar form, despite being rooted in ancient Greek drama.</p> <p>Coward\u2019s <em>Present Laughter</em> is full of jokes about such theatrical snobbery, with one of the characters dismissively comparing the action to a French farce. But there are also a few pointed jokes in the script about the unplayability of Henrik Ibsen\u2019s deeply serious <em>Peer Gynt</em>, a play that opens at the National Theatre in a new version by David Hare tomorrow. Ray Cooney\u2019s essential rules of farce, first laid out in the 1980s by the playwright, now 87, stipulated that these comedies should have a strong element of tragedy running through them. He also felt that the drama should take place in \u201creal time\u201d for the audience, with no leaping backward or forward.</p> <p>Jeremy Herrin\u2019s revival of <em>Noises Off</em> largely obeys these rules, as does Alan Ayckbourn\u2019s <em>Seasons Greetings</em>, being revived for a run at the playwright\u2019s Stephen Joseph Theatre in Scarborough this September \u2013 the first time since its premiere there in 1980.</p> <p>The appeal of watching from the stalls as everything \u201cgoes wrong\u201d seems to be back in full force and as Ayckbourn, 85, has said: \u201cYou may think you\u2019ve had a bad Christmas, but wait until you see this one.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The stage is set like a hotel bedroom where a scantily clad woman is hiding inside a wardrobe and a man\u2019s socked foot sticks out from under the bed. At the sound of an unexpected knock at the door the whole audience knows exactly where they are: safe in the land of farce, where life is even more complicated than the real thing and the frantic pace of the action will build until the final curtain. This summer the time-honoured tradition of broad stage comedy is back in the West End with a vengeance. A series of acclaimed new productions, including a whirlwind re-working of No\u00ebl Coward\u2019s Present Laughter at the Old Vic and a new revival at the Lyric Hammersmith of Michael Frayn\u2019s Noises Off \u2013 a 1982 farce about putting on a farce \u2013 have both now joined the hugely successful show The Play that Goes Wrong as a new generation of theatregoers discovers the joy of pure farce. Playwright Jenny Selway, whose own new farce, Flat Out, has just closed after a critically acclaimed run, is delighted to see the genre return in triumph. \u201cIt\u2019s the cruellest, most delicious humour,\u201d she said this weekend. But Selway is unsure if the current boom is a response to the gloomy political mood or simply driven by the fact that writers and producers have worked out how to revive the form without the stereotypes. \u201cAre we suddenly keen on staging farces because we\u2019re living through such serious times? It sounds neat, but times are usually serious,\u201d Selway said. \u201cIt is true, though, that there\u2019s an absurdity about today\u2019s politics, including identity politics, and farce does chime with that.\u201d During the original London heyday of the genre in the 1960s, 70s and 80s, popular shows such as Brian Rix\u2019s Whitehall farces and Ray Cooney\u2019s Run for your Wife were all littered with misunderstandings and missing trousers. But 1980s farces with jokes at the expense of dumb blondes or gay men would not play well now. \u201cIn Flat Out I wanted to find comedy in today\u2019s obsessions and preoccupations and still have people taking their clothes off and hiding in cupboards,\u201d said Selway, who also believes farce should not be classed as \u201clight comedy\u201d, since the dramatis personae are all usually \u201chaving the worst day of their lives\u201d. Even Coward\u2019s witty 1939 comedy Present Laughter, which stars Andrew Scott as the egotistical actor at its centre, has been updated for 2019 with a gender change in one of the love affairs. While the new productions are generally more politically aware, they are doing such roaring box office business that two spin-off stage shows, The Comedy About A Bank Robbery and Peter Pan Goes Wrong, from the team behind The Play that Goes Wrong, are also drawing in big West End crowds. The film director JJ Abrams, the comedian Peter Kay and the American magicians Penn &amp; Teller are among ardent fans of these shows. And a Goes Wrong television series based on the franchise is currently being filmed in front of audiences in Manchester, ready to come to small screens this autumn. After two television specials that guest starred Diana Rigg and Derek Jacobi, the BBC has commissioned six half-hour stories that will see the ill-fated Cornley Drama Society undertake another ambitious production, as well as a courtroom drama and a second world war spy thriller. The term \u201cfarce\u201d comes from the Latin \u201cto stuff\u201d, and a typical plot is packed with twists, puns, concealments and increasingly rapid entrances and exits. As a result, farce has often been scorned as a vulgar form, despite being rooted in ancient Greek drama. Coward\u2019s Present Laughter is full of jokes about such theatrical snobbery, with one of the characters dismissively comparing the action to a French farce. But there are also a few pointed jokes in the script about the unplayability of Henrik Ibsen\u2019s deeply serious Peer Gynt, a play that opens at the National Theatre in a new version by David Hare tomorrow. Ray Cooney\u2019s essential rules of farce, first laid out in the 1980s by the playwright, now 87, stipulated that these comedies should have a strong element of tragedy running through them. He also felt that the drama should take place in \u201creal time\u201d for the audience, with no leaping backward or forward. Jeremy Herrin\u2019s revival of Noises Off largely obeys these rules, as does Alan Ayckbourn\u2019s Seasons Greetings, being revived for a run at the playwright\u2019s Stephen Joseph Theatre in Scarborough this September \u2013 the first time since its premiere there in 1980. The appeal of watching from the stalls as everything \u201cgoes wrong\u201d seems to be back in full force and as Ayckbourn, 85, has said: \u201cYou may think you\u2019ve had a bad Christmas, but wait until you see this one.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Mike Ashley is the Premier League equivalent of Captain Rum \u2013 the seafarer from Blackadder who runs his ship in a contrary manner to \u201call the other captains\u201d \u2013 though much as it must depress supporters to lose their leading scorer so soon after a popular manager, the bottom line in Ayoze P\u00e9rez\u2019s move to Leicester stands up to scrutiny. Newcastle\u2019s owner knows more about trading than most \u2013 he has certainly made plenty of money through his grasp of markets and mark-ups \u2013 and, though critics might accuse him of caring for little else, it cannot be denied that raising \u00a330m for a player who cost \u00a31.5m five years ago is eye-catching. The wisdom of selling a striker whose goals helped Newcastle stay up last season is debatable, as is parting with a highly capable manager, though as long as he can continue to buy cheap and sell high Ashley will feel he can see a way through all the protest and predicted poor results. Alan Pardew was in charge when P\u00e9rez was signed from Tenerife in 2014 and Graham Carr was still on scouting duty. The talent-spotter responsible for importing players such as Yohan Cabaye, Papiss Ciss\u00e9 and Cheick Tiot\u00e9 did not last long after the arrival of Rafa Ben\u00edtez, though just for a short while \u2013 until supporters began wondering whether Carr ever looked anywhere other than France and Germany, in fact \u2013 Newcastle found a way to beat the Premier League\u2019s absurdly inflated prices by finding quality players in unheralded locations. More famously Steve Walsh did the same thing at Leicester a few years later, not only seeing the potential in non-league Fleetwood\u2019s Jamie Vardy but providing the grace notes to a title-winning side by unearthing Riyad Mahrez and N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 from Le Havre and Caen, respectively.

Clearly that is how to conduct football business, especially with the most unlikely of title successes thrown in, yet when Everton asked Walsh to replicate the process on Merseyside both he and Ronald Koeman bombed. Everton had recruited the latter on the strength of progress at Southampton, where in addition to encouraging young players from the club\u2019s academy he had sanctioned the purchase of Virgil van Dijk from Celtic for \u00a313m. When the defender joined Liverpool three years later for an eye-watering \u00a375m, Southampton were congratulated on both their talent-spotting and salesmanship, though Celtic had in fact been just as prescient, paying Groningen a mere \u00a32.6m for Van Dijk in 2013. While Koeman\u2019s knowledge of Dutch prospects undoubtedly persuaded him to take what in retrospect does not appear much of a gamble, it was quickly evident that few scouts from leading Premier League clubs had been keeping an eye on Scottish football. Otherwise they might have spotted Andy Robertson, who became a Champions League winner with Liverpool only after Hull brought him to England from Dundee United for \u00a32.85m in 2014. Even after three eventful seasons on Humberside Robertson was not an obvious target for bigger clubs, though the relatively modest \u00a38m fee that took him to Anfield is now regularly cited as one of the deals of the decade. So will P\u00e9rez ever come to be regarded as a bargain at \u00a330m or are Leicester being generous in anticipation of riches from the imminent sale of Harry Maguire? There is no way of knowing for sure; it is all about timing and context. Mo Salah cost Liverpool only \u00a337m, for example, and one doubts whether P\u00e9rez will be quite as sensational for a similar price.

Sandhu was placed on restricted duties while the allegations were looked into but investigators concluded last month that there was no case to answer. A Metropolitan police spokesman said: \u201cThe Met\u2019s directorate of professional standards began an investigation into the conduct of three officers following an allegation they breached guidelines relating to the UK honours nomination process. \u201cThe investigation concluded in June 2019 and found there was no case to answer for gross misconduct or misconduct in relation to any of the officers.

Britten\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.garsingtonopera.org/performance/turn-screw\" title=\"\">The Turn of the Screw</a></strong> creates challenges in casting, staging, interpretation: how do you deal with singing ghosts, not to mention singing children (keep reading), and a story barely told? Yet it manages to attract consistently strong productions. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jul/01/romeo-et-juliette-grange-park-cave-tansy-davies-turn-of-the-screw-regents-park-review\" title=\"\">Last summer\u2019s open-air version</a> by ENO is still so vivid that another \u2013 by <a href=\"https://www.louisamuller.com/\" title=\"\">Louisa Muller</a>, making her Garsington Opera debut \u2013 came round too soon in prospect. Proof that you never tire of excellence, this latest <em>Turn of the Screw</em> was brilliant and spine-tingling, as well as beautifully conceived and superbly performed.</p> <p>Premiered at La Fenice, Venice in 1954, Britten\u2019s chamber opera \u2013 based on Henry James\u2019s novella, with a libretto by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/aug/29/myfanwy-piper-betjeman-britten\" title=\"\">Myfanwy Piper</a> \u2013 consists of a series of tiny scenes, which merge into one another but make unexplained leaps in chronology.

      "bodyText": "Just as some operas are minefields for directors \u2013 Don Giovanni and Carmen are notorious \u2013 so others appear watertight, resistant to all approaches. It\u2019s never because this latter category is easy. Far from it. Britten\u2019s The Turn of the Screw creates challenges in casting, staging, interpretation: how do you deal with singing ghosts, not to mention singing children (keep reading), and a story barely told? Yet it manages to attract consistently strong productions. Last summer\u2019s open-air version by ENO is still so vivid that another \u2013 by Louisa Muller, making her Garsington Opera debut \u2013 came round too soon in prospect. Proof that you never tire of excellence, this latest Turn of the Screw was brilliant and spine-tingling, as well as beautifully conceived and superbly performed. Premiered at La Fenice, Venice in 1954, Britten\u2019s chamber opera \u2013 based on Henry James\u2019s novella, with a libretto by Myfanwy Piper \u2013 consists of a series of tiny scenes, which merge into one another but make unexplained leaps in chronology. One moment the naive young Governess arrives at a remote country house to look after two parentless children, Flora and Miles. The next she is uncontrollably haunted by a past, their past, which is never explained. All is tantalisingly ambiguous. The strength of Muller\u2019s production, true of any staging of this most chilling of works, is to retain the lightest steer on the action. Even the nature of the evil perpetrated by the dead valet Peter Quint (Ed Lyon), assumed to be sexual, is left open. The sympathetic housekeeper, Mrs Grose (Kathleen Wilkinson), may or may not think the Governess (Sophie Bevan) is out of her mind. The children, outstandingly played by Adrianna Forbes-Dorant and Leo Jemison, smile somewhat slyly but perhaps, after all, are innocent. Both have big parts to sing. Commiserations to treble Lucas Rebato, a memorable First Boy in Garsington\u2019s Die Zauberfl\u00f6te last year. Due to share the role of Miles, his voice broke just days before opening night. No doubt he\u2019ll be back, lower down the vocal register. Garsington\u2019s glass-sided, pavilion-style theatre means the performance starts in broad daylight.

      "body": "<p>The Malory Towers books \u2013 for anyone whose childhood was cruelly deprived of them \u2013 are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/enid-blyton\" title=\"\">Enid Blyton\u2019s</a> series of raucous stories set in a girls\u2019 boarding school in postwar Britain. They are heartwarming. They are funny. The one thing they\u2019re apparently not, though, is current.</p> <p>On the face of it, tales of classroom tricks and Cornish cliffs have little to say to those growing up in the modern, digital world. Then there\u2019s the matter of Blyton\u2019s class snobbery, racism and sexism; even though Malory Towers is more forward-looking than the rest of her catalogue, admitting you\u2019re a fan is often received as tacit admittance that you have a secret shrine to Nigel Farage in your basement.</p> <p>But as devotees like me have long maintained, the prevailing messages are ones of tolerance, community and female power. No bad thing, then, that it\u2019s enjoying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/05/malory-towers-why-enid-blytons-series-is-made-for-modern-times\" title=\"\">an unexpected rebirth</a>. Last week CBBC announced it had commissioned a Malory Towers adaptation to air in 2020. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.wisechildren.co.uk/productions/malory-towers/tour\" title=\"\">a stage version produced by Wise Children</a>, the theatre company led by former Shakespeare\u2019s Globe director Emma Rice, is about to go on tour. Then there\u2019s a volume of four new stories written by modern authors.</p> <p>Malory Towers is said to still be a big seller (like the rest of Blyton\u2019s books: she\u2019s amassed more than 500m worldwide sales). But the franchise is now fashionable rather than just lucrative. Why have tales of common room sing-songs and half-term teas been swept up by the zeitgeist?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a96235ef3d97d2c8f4b265cd3ca10fc683562587\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a96235ef3d97d2c8f4b265cd3ca10fc683562587/0_0_1217_2000/609.jpg\" alt=\"The second book in Enid Blyton\u2019s Malory towers series, written in 1947.\" width=\"609\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The second book in Enid Blyton\u2019s Malory towers series, written in 1947.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Book jacker</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The series was written between 1946 and 1951, when Clement Attlee\u2019s Labour government was nursing the country back to health after the war. For Rice, this means Malory Towers is imbued with hope and goodwill \u2013 attitudes useful in the current political climate.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to look into faces not of rage and bitterness but of hope and truth, like Greta Thunberg and all the brave young climate change activists,\u201d she says. Lucy Mangan, journalist and author of one of the new stories, can also spot a political resonance: \u201cThe books are set in a stable, unchanging, enclosed, safe little world \u2013 which we all hanker for at some time or another, and I suspect more than ever now that everything seems to be going to hell in a handcart.\u201d</p> <p>Blyton is hardly a common source of feminist inspiration. But with Malory Towers\u2019s emphasis on women\u2019s potential, it arguably chimes with current conversations around gender. Indeed, the stage production is billed as \u201cthe original \u2018Girl Power\u2019 story\u201d. Rice points out that the all-female character list means it aces <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/punctuated-equilibrium/2010/nov/24/2\" title=\"\">the Bechdel test</a>, which measures the representation of women in works of art. \u201cI love how uninterested in traditional ideas of femininity the characters are,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s such an empowering picture of girlhood for young people today. Nobody is asking them to conform.\u201d</p> <p>It would be preposterous, however, to suggest that such feminism caters for an audience beyond posh white girls. In contrast, the new wave of Malory Towers adaptations is resoundingly diverse. Rice\u2019s production features BAME and non-binary trans actors in the lead roles. \u201cThese stories are to be enjoyed by everyone and, for that to make sense, the young people in the audience need to be able to see themselves onstage,\u201d she says. And while it\u2019s early days for the BBC adaptation, commissioning editor Amy Buscombe says \u201ccasting will be as representative as you\u2019d expect for a modern CBBC production.\u201d </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/malory-towers-new-class-at-malory-towers-9781444951004.html\" title=\"\">New Class At Malory Towers</a></em>, the collection of new stories, also updates Blyton\u2019s all-white cast. Narinder Dhami\u2019s story centres on an Indian pupil called Sunita, while Patrice Lawrence portrays Marietta, a mixed-race girl. Lawrence points out that Blyton\u2019s originals are dodgy when it comes to representation: \u201cI\u2019ve met people who were at boarding school whose parents sent them from overseas in the 40s and 50s. We also know that people from African and Caribbean descent have been here for a very long time.\u201d</p> <p>When Lawrence was growing up in an Italian-Trinidadian family in Sussex, she says she had to do an \u201cethnic hop\u201d to enjoy literature. She hopes that inclusive updates will save future generations from doing the same: \u201cFor a woman to see someone like her in something as iconic as Malory Towers is a really big deal.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d4bee70e9d6b07b69edad7eae92f84e9c65db0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d4bee70e9d6b07b69edad7eae92f84e9c65db0e/0_62_2968_1782/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Enid Blyton sitting in her garden in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Enid Blyton sitting in her garden in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Konig/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not all modern tweaks are welcomed; in 2016, \u201csensitive revisions\u201d of Blyton\u2019s Famous Five books were famously pulled from sales in favour of the originals. But beyond the unmistakably white lineup, there are anachronistic elements of Malory Towers that patently need modernising if they\u2019re to be adapted for new forms \u2013 the fat-shaming for one.</p> <p>How can we update classics without eradicating what makes them distinctive? \u201cYou take the bits you love and quietly leave the rest behind,\u201d says Rice. And while Mangan is \u201cquite anti mucking about with the originals\u201d because of their historical context, she reckons that \u201cif you are writing new stuff, you should jettison as many of the unfortunate things as you can\u201d.</p> <p>One of the most appealing aspects of Malory Towers is how forward-looking and resourceful (most of) the characters are. There is a neat symmetry in how the series\u2019s renaissance is being led by open-minded, inventive storytellers \u2013 many of whom are women. In cutting old-fashioned tropes and foregrounding the books\u2019 best aspects \u2013 humour, friendship, the emphasis on women discovering themselves in a space almost entirely absent of men \u2013 a sparky, emboldening series has been preserved for new generations. That\u2019s something to celebrate, perhaps with lashings of something stronger than ginger beer.</p> <p><em>Malory Towers opens at the Passenger Shed in Bristol on 19 July, then tours the UK.

      "bodyText": "The Malory Towers books \u2013 for anyone whose childhood was cruelly deprived of them \u2013 are Enid Blyton\u2019s series of raucous stories set in a girls\u2019 boarding school in postwar Britain. They are heartwarming. They are funny. The one thing they\u2019re apparently not, though, is current. On the face of it, tales of classroom tricks and Cornish cliffs have little to say to those growing up in the modern, digital world. Then there\u2019s the matter of Blyton\u2019s class snobbery, racism and sexism; even though Malory Towers is more forward-looking than the rest of her catalogue, admitting you\u2019re a fan is often received as tacit admittance that you have a secret shrine to Nigel Farage in your basement. But as devotees like me have long maintained, the prevailing messages are ones of tolerance, community and female power. No bad thing, then, that it\u2019s enjoying an unexpected rebirth. Last week CBBC announced it had commissioned a Malory Towers adaptation to air in 2020. Meanwhile, a stage version produced by Wise Children, the theatre company led by former Shakespeare\u2019s Globe director Emma Rice, is about to go on tour. Then there\u2019s a volume of four new stories written by modern authors. Malory Towers is said to still be a big seller (like the rest of Blyton\u2019s books: she\u2019s amassed more than 500m worldwide sales). But the franchise is now fashionable rather than just lucrative. Why have tales of common room sing-songs and half-term teas been swept up by the zeitgeist? The series was written between 1946 and 1951, when Clement Attlee\u2019s Labour government was nursing the country back to health after the war. For Rice, this means Malory Towers is imbued with hope and goodwill \u2013 attitudes useful in the current political climate. \u201cWe want to look into faces not of rage and bitterness but of hope and truth, like Greta Thunberg and all the brave young climate change activists,\u201d she says. Lucy Mangan, journalist and author of one of the new stories, can also spot a political resonance: \u201cThe books are set in a stable, unchanging, enclosed, safe little world \u2013 which we all hanker for at some time or another, and I suspect more than ever now that everything seems to be going to hell in a handcart.\u201d Blyton is hardly a common source of feminist inspiration. But with Malory Towers\u2019s emphasis on women\u2019s potential, it arguably chimes with current conversations around gender. Indeed, the stage production is billed as \u201cthe original \u2018Girl Power\u2019 story\u201d. Rice points out that the all-female character list means it aces the Bechdel test, which measures the representation of women in works of art. \u201cI love how uninterested in traditional ideas of femininity the characters are,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s such an empowering picture of girlhood for young people today. Nobody is asking them to conform.\u201d It would be preposterous, however, to suggest that such feminism caters for an audience beyond posh white girls. In contrast, the new wave of Malory Towers adaptations is resoundingly diverse. Rice\u2019s production features BAME and non-binary trans actors in the lead roles. \u201cThese stories are to be enjoyed by everyone and, for that to make sense, the young people in the audience need to be able to see themselves onstage,\u201d she says. And while it\u2019s early days for the BBC adaptation, commissioning editor Amy Buscombe says \u201ccasting will be as representative as you\u2019d expect for a modern CBBC production.\u201d New Class At Malory Towers, the collection of new stories, also updates Blyton\u2019s all-white cast. Narinder Dhami\u2019s story centres on an Indian pupil called Sunita, while Patrice Lawrence portrays Marietta, a mixed-race girl. Lawrence points out that Blyton\u2019s originals are dodgy when it comes to representation: \u201cI\u2019ve met people who were at boarding school whose parents sent them from overseas in the 40s and 50s. We also know that people from African and Caribbean descent have been here for a very long time.\u201d When Lawrence was growing up in an Italian-Trinidadian family in Sussex, she says she had to do an \u201cethnic hop\u201d to enjoy literature. She hopes that inclusive updates will save future generations from doing the same: \u201cFor a woman to see someone like her in something as iconic as Malory Towers is a really big deal.\u201d Not all modern tweaks are welcomed; in 2016, \u201csensitive revisions\u201d of Blyton\u2019s Famous Five books were famously pulled from sales in favour of the originals. But beyond the unmistakably white lineup, there are anachronistic elements of Malory Towers that patently need modernising if they\u2019re to be adapted for new forms \u2013 the fat-shaming for one. How can we update classics without eradicating what makes them distinctive? \u201cYou take the bits you love and quietly leave the rest behind,\u201d says Rice. And while Mangan is \u201cquite anti mucking about with the originals\u201d because of their historical context, she reckons that \u201cif you are writing new stuff, you should jettison as many of the unfortunate things as you can\u201d. One of the most appealing aspects of Malory Towers is how forward-looking and resourceful (most of) the characters are. There is a neat symmetry in how the series\u2019s renaissance is being led by open-minded, inventive storytellers \u2013 many of whom are women. In cutting old-fashioned tropes and foregrounding the books\u2019 best aspects \u2013 humour, friendship, the emphasis on women discovering themselves in a space almost entirely absent of men \u2013 a sparky, emboldening series has been preserved for new generations. That\u2019s something to celebrate, perhaps with lashings of something stronger than ginger beer. Malory Towers opens at the Passenger Shed in Bristol on 19 July, then tours the UK. New Class at Malory Towers is published by Hodder Haven\u2019t read the books? Here\u2019s a glossary to help Darrell Rivers Protagonist whom the books follow through her six years at school.

      "bodyText": "When I lived in Brighton, I was lucky enough to live around the corner from a fantastic bakery. It was the sort of place I would pop into for a quick sandwich and end up leaving with my arms full of pastries and crackling loaves of bread. It was also where I had my first taste of bostock, a French pastry originally devised as a thrifty way to use up stale brioche. With its layers of buttery frangipane and toasty, syrup-soaked bread, it\u2019s the sort of weekend breakfast I spend the whole week looking forward to. Orange and blackcurrant bostock Bostock traditionally calls for brioche, although this is not something I usually have going spare. The Jewish bread challah makes an excellent substitute, or use any good-quality, thick-sliced white bread. Prep 20 min Cook 15 min Serves 4 4 large slices brioche, challah, or good-quality, thick-cut white bread 1 large handful blackcurrants 100g flaked almonds Icing sugar, to serve Creme fraiche, to serve (optional) For the syrup 1 large orange, juiced, and zest pared 70g caster or granulated sugar For the frangipane 125g unsalted butter, at room temperature 160g caster sugar 2 medium eggs 200g ground almonds 1 tsp salt \u00be tsp almond extract (optional) Heat the oven to 210C (190C fan)/ 400F/gas 6\u00bd. To make the syrup, use a vegetable peeler to pare strips of zest from the juiced orange. Add to a small saucepan along with the juice and sugar. Bring to a boil, simmer for a few minutes, until it is a syrupy consistency, then leave to cool. To make the frangipane, cream the butter and sugar, then stir in the eggs, almonds, salt and almond extract (if using), until combined. To assemble the bostock, arrange the brioche slices on a baking sheet and drizzle with the orange syrup. Divide the frangipane between the four slices and spread evenly. Scatter over the blackcurrants, gently nudging them into the frangipane, followed by the flaked almonds. Bake for 15 minutes, by which time the frangipane will have toasted to a chestnut brown. Dust with a little icing sugar and serve with a spoonful of creme fraiche, if you like.",

Both grow on path edges, lawns and long grass. Herb robert smells musky when crushed, but the juice is a powerful styptic, stopping a cut or a thorn wound in seconds. Selfheal (<em>Prunella vulgaris</em>) is another fellow of wilder lawns that is amazing at helping wounds to heal. It\u2019s a strong antimicrobial and will knit together difficult grazes. Chickweed (<em>Stellaria media)</em>, another common weed of bare ground in the garden, turns into a soft, kind herb for the skin when mashed. It will soothe rashes and sores.

An easy-going perennial with liquorice-tasting leaves and brilliant purple flowers, I swear it\u2019s the best hangover tea. It will soothe your sore head and settle your stomach. If liquorice isn\u2019t your thing, try lemon balm. As a tea it will calm nausea, aid digestion and is deeply relaxing.

The nutty, sweet flavour of toasted fennel seeds is a delightful way to consume such a medicine, but all three can be made into a tea for after dinner, with a little honey added, if necessary. To get the most out of the seed, bash it a little first, then steep for 10-15 minutes.

Iain Duncan Smith, the former party leader and chairman of Johnson\u2019s campaign, said the chairman of the Conservative party had been asked to look into the problem of multiple ballot papers being given to members. \u201cObviously there is an issue here, I accept that,\u201d Smith told the Today programme. \u201cIn all elections there are issues about this, where people are registered separately.\u201d Smith echoed McLoughlin\u2019s call for Tory members to not vote more than once. \u201cIt\u2019s quite clear as Patrick McLoughlin said that you are not to vote more than once. \u201cBut it\u2019s clear that the Conservative party needs to continue to do some work and look into how they can actually sift this properly so that they recognise who is who.\u201d The Electoral Commission, which sets standards for how UK elections are run, has no role in the leadership contest. Theresa May will take her final session of prime minister\u2019s questions on 24 July and hand over to the contest winner that afternoon.",

A Perth court jury found the three-times world champion guilty of trafficking hundreds of ecstasy tablets to former professional cyclist Alex McGregor. Bobridge, a father of one, maintained his innocence. Judge Stephen Scott said Bobridge had fallen into \u201cpartying, drugs and alcohol\u201d while still an elite cyclist but addiction was no excuse for supplying them into the community.

Cricket World Cup: Dimuth Karunaratne wins the toss at Headingley and Sri Lanka will bat first in the first of tonight\u2019s games. Join Tim De Lisle to follow this one: The ball is kicked into touch after the siren goes and the Crusaders are Super Rugby champions for 2019! Emotional scenes in Christchurch, the city which has endured so much tragedy and heartache this year. It\u2019s a 10th title for the New Zealand club \u2013 their third on the trot \u2013 and thoroughly deserved once again this season. As droves of Crows fans head for the exit with more than five minutes still remaining, it\u2019s obvious there\u2019s to be no miraculous comeback in Adelaide tonight. Port wrap up a comprehensive Showdown 47 victory and make amends for last week\u2019s 25-point defeat to the Western Bulldogs. The Power end the game at a canter, kicking the last nine goals in the final quarter to post a 57-point win. The brilliant Robbie Gray engineered a five-goal burst in 11 minutes as Port replaced Adelaide in seventh spot on the ladder. Gray collected 35 disposals, including 10 and four clearances in the third quarter blitz. The Power led by three points at half-time against a wasteful Adelaide, who kicked 4.11 for the half. Crows captain Taylor Walker then sank a long two-step snap within 15 seconds of the third quarter \u2013 ultimately Adelaide\u2019s final goal of the game. From then, the Power kicked nine consecutive goals in a spree triggered by ruckman Scott Lycett\u2019s superb 40-metre goal on the gallop. (AAP) Cycling: Australian former world champion cyclist Jack Bobridge has been jailed for more than four years for drug dealing. The 29-year-old, who won silver medals in the team pursuit at the last two Olympics before retiring in late 2016, was arrested two years ago in Perth on charges of dealing ecstasy after a friend was caught during a nightclub sting. A Perth court jury found the three-times world champion guilty of trafficking hundreds of ecstasy tablets to former professional cyclist Alex McGregor. Bobridge, a father of one, maintained his innocence. Judge Stephen Scott said Bobridge had fallen into \u201cpartying, drugs and alcohol\u201d while still an elite cyclist but addiction was no excuse for supplying them into the community. Bobridge was jailed for a total of four years and six months and will be eligible for parole after serving two years and six months. (Reuters) Netball: The World Cup (yep, another one) starts in Liverpool on Friday. The Diamonds begin their title defence as favourites, but it\u2019s not going to be plain sailing for Lisa Alexander\u2019s side. Our series of previews will start on Monday, including a 10 things to look out for and a team-by-team guide, but to whet the appetite, here\u2019s an interview with one of England\u2019s star players. AFL: This really is an incredible story and one that should not be brushed over. Majak Daw will line up for North Melbourne\u2019s VFL side against Sandringham at Arden St tomorrow after coming through a training session this morning \u2013 just seven months since he was found in the Yarra River after falling from Bolte Bridge. There can\u2019t be a sane person alive who won\u2019t be 100% behind him. AFL: 3QT Adelaide (42) Port Adelaide (77): Well, well, well. There was little in it at half-time, but Port flexed their muscles in the third quarter and booted the last six goals to open up a 35-point lead. The Crows have a mountain to climb now if they\u2019re to get anything from this game. Super Rugby: HT Crusaders 10-3 Jaguares: A penalty goes the Crusaders\u2019 way as time runs out and they opt to have a crack at goal. Richie Mo\u2019unga delivers with a booming kick and the New Zealand side will take a seven-point lead into the sheds at the half-time break. Super Rugby: Crusaders 7-3 Jaguares: Codie Taylor crosses for the first try of the evening to give the Crusaders the lead on 26 minutes! Kieran Read flicks a pass out to captain Sam Whitelock who puts his head down and motors down the wing before passing back inside to Taylor who bundles over the line! The conversion by Mo\u2019unga is good and the home side have a four-point lead midway through the first half in Christchurch. Women\u2019s World Cup: With the final between the US and the Netherlands nearly upon us (Monday 1am AEST kick-off), it\u2019s a good time to reflect on some of the highlights of the past four weeks. I say \u201chighlights\u201d, but that\u2019s a poor choice of word as one of the six \u201cmoments\u201d here features Sam Kerr\u2019s penalty shootout miss in the Matildas\u2019 defeat to Norway. Australia exited the tournament in the last 16 but the presence of the green and gold shirts in stadiums across France in the subsequent weeks suggests Matildas fans had been optimistic about their team\u2019s likely progress. Sam Kerr\u2019s penalty miss against Norway in Nice will haunt them for some time. After an exhausting 120 minutes the Matildas\u2019 marquee player stepped up to take Australia\u2019s first penalty. As millions of bleary-eyed Australians watched back home Kerr spectacularly hit it high and wide. There would be no recovery for the Matildas. When the Australia fans who remained in France file into the Stade de Lyon on Sunday, they will wonder what might have been had Kerr converted. Have a read of five other key moments from the tournament in France: Super Rugby: They\u2019re underway in Christchurch, and with 10 minutes gone, there\u2019s still no score. Here\u2019s how the teams line up: Crusaders: David Havili, Sevu Reece, Braydon Ennor, Jack Goodhue, George Bridge, Richie Mo\u2019unga, Bryn Hall, Kieran Read, Matt Todd, Whetukamokamo Douglas, Sam Whitelock (capt), Mitchell Dunshea, Owen Franks, Codie Taylor, Joe Moody. Jaguares: Emiliano Boffelli, Matias Moroni, Matias Orlando, Jeronimo de la Fuente (capt), Ramiro Moyano, Joaquin Diaz Bonilla, Tomas Cubelli, Javier Ortega Desio, Marcos Kremer, Pablo Matera, Tomas Lavanini, Guido Petti, Santiago Medrano, Agustin Creevy, Nahuel Tetaz Chaparro. AFL: HT Adelaide 4.11 (35) Port Adelaide 6.2 (38): Brad Ebert puts Port ahead by three with two minutes remaining in the half with the Power\u2019s third straight goal off the back of three straight for the Crows. A lung-busting run to take the mark prompts TV commentary to describe him as \u201ca great aerobic beast\u201d. Quite. Finely poised at the long break at Adelaide Oval! Tour de France: Ah, July, a time of wistfully watching the French countryside speed past our television screens, a time for craving camembert and a glass of Beaujolais, and holidaying in an 18th century chateau with a moat. All thanks to Le Tour, which kicks off this weekend at Le Grand Depart in Brussels. Australian hopes of wearing the famed yellow jersey are especially high early on, as sprinter Caleb Ewan has a real chance of winning the flat opening stage. If he can cross the line first in Brussels, he\u2019ll immediately don the maillot jaune, just 194.5km into his Tour debut. Kieran Pender spoke to him in the buildup to the race and found him to eagerly anticipating his first involvement in the race, after the disappointment of being pulled by his previous team last year. Wimbledon: Back to SW19 in London, and as usual there\u2019s been a lot of talk about a certain Nick Kyrgios this week, following his entertaining (you can\u2019t deny it) match against Rafael Nadal and the press conference which followed. Flawed or comedy genius? Petulant brat or misunderstood talent? We could talk forever on this topic. Anyway, Kevin Mitchell has had some thoughts on the Canberran by way of comparison to the original tennis super brat. He shares with John McEnroe the gift of pushing the right buttons, then leaving the room with questions unanswered, arguments raging. Where they differ crucially and obviously is McEnroe red-lined most of his career, which stretched intermittently from 1978 to 2006, and stilled his demons long enough to win 77 singles and 78 doubles titles, the most combined by any player in the Open era. He was a major champion seven times. Kyrgios has been on the Tour since 2012 and won five titles from 12 finals. He has got to the quarters in two majors, the first when he famously beat Rafael Nadal on Centre Court at Wimbledon in 2014. Read the full story here: AFL: QT Adelaide 2.7 (19) v Port Adelaide 3.1 (19): Lachlan Murphy has a chance to give the Crows the lead right at the end of the quarter but he\u2019s off target. The umpires didn\u2019t like his effort anyway and, despite Crows fans making their displeasure known, the teams head off on level pegging. Women\u2019s World Cup: This is well worth a look \u2013 a behind-the-scenes look at how some of the best footballers in the world prepared for the tournament in France. My personal favourite? The look on the faces of Rose Lavelle and Alex Morgan as they freeze in the ice bath. They definitely want to be somewhere else. There goes the siren at Metricon and it\u2019s a day to forget for the Suns, but for the Tigers a thumping 92-point win, which will do their percentage no harm at all as we head towards finals, is just the statement their coach, Damien Hardwick, had called for before the game. Richmond would have been forgiven for thinking they were already over the line after romping to an 84-point half-time lead in front of 16,031 fans. It was the Tigers\u2019 third-highest half-time score, just short of their record 17.9 (111) against North Melbourne in 1931. The 84-point deficit was Richmond\u2019s second-biggest half-time lead, boosting their percentage from 95.3 to 102.4 in just two quarters. It also marked the first time in seven years that an AFL team had racked up 100 points in a half. In the end Richmond (9-6) boosted their percentage to 103. Remarkably the Tigers had started the match with a percentage of 95.3 - the worst of any team inside the top 13. Richmond will now be ideally placed to turn home and make a serious finals run, with their next seven games at the MCG. (AAP) Cricket World Cup: On the other side of the world later on tonight AEST, Australia wrap up the first stage of the Cricket World Cup with their final game against South Africa at Old Trafford. Starting a couple of hours earlier, India play Sri Lanka and it\u2019s basically a shootout between Australia and India for top spot now. Victory in Manchester for Justin Langer\u2019s side will ensure they finish first and book a date with New Zealand, regardless of what India do in Leeds. Defeat though and they risk a second-place finish \u2013 and a semi-final against hosts England. The good news out of the Australia camp after a horror net session 48 hours ago that broke Shaun Marsh\u2019s wrist and ended his tournament is that Glenn Maxwell looks like he\u2019ll be fit enough to take part, despite also being struck by a short ball during training. \u201cHe said he\u2019s been able to hold the bat no problem,\u201d captain Aaron Finch said. \u201cAt the end of the day, I think we will leave that call up to him, if he feels confident enough to get out there and do the job. The one that he got just didn\u2019t bounce quite as much as he expected, it hit him on the arm. No fault of anyone really.\u201d Nicky Winmar statue: As we get ready for the start of Showdown 47 at Adelaide Oval, some good news from outside Optus Stadium \u2013 the statue depicting Nicky Winmar\u2019s famous stance against racism has been officially unveiled. The work depicts the moment Winmar, a Noongar man, changed conversation in Australia by lifting his football jumper and pointing to his skin. He declared, \u201cI\u2019m black and I\u2019m proud\u201d. The iconic image, taken by photographer Wayne Ludbey at Victoria Park in round four of the 1993 premiership season, captured Nicky\u2019s response to racial abuse he had suffered throughout his career and on that day. \u201cIt\u2019s a surreal thing to be a part of and it\u2019s something my family are very proud of,\u201d Winmar said. \u201cI hope this statue encourages more conversations and education about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander history and culture.\u201d Wimbledon. Ash Barty will finally get to take centre stage at the All England Club when she takes to Centre Court on middle Saturday for her third-round match against Harriet Dart. Having been snubbed in rounds one and two \u2013 when she had to make do with the less rarefied surrounds of Court One and Two for her opening outings \u2013 the world No 1 will get her dues \u2013 and on arguably the glitziest day of the championships. Middle Saturday is always earmarked a day to celebrate the cream of UK sport, with the royal box reserved for a host of champions who will this year watch on as Barty takes on Dart, the British wildcard. Not that she will be intimidated. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be playing a British crowd; I\u2019m playing against Harriet,\u201d Barty said. \u201cYes, she\u2019ll get more support being in Britain, as I would if we were in Australia. It\u2019s no different.\u201d There\u2019s just one other Australian in action on Saturday \u2013 John Millman plays American Sam Querrey in the third round in the first match on Court 12. The first result of the day just in \u2013 and a final quarter surge from the Bombers has proved the difference in what had been a tight game until that point. Bombers by 10 at the MCG. The Swans led by three points at three-quarter time, but the Bombers sprang to life to boot the first four goals of Saturday afternoon\u2019s final term to set up a 11.10 (76) to 9.12 (66) win in front of 60,199 fans. The victory was the resurgent Essendon\u2019s fourth in their past five matches and snapped a run of three wins for Sydney, whose last victory against the Bombers at the MCG was in 1923. Heppell was ruled out with a sore foot before the opening bounce, but Dylan Shiel (29 possessions), Darcy Parish (22) and David Zaharakis (22 touches and three goals) stepped up in his absence. Josh Kennedy was outstanding for the Swans with 35 disposals, as was Isaac Heeney with 33. But, with Lance Franklin still absent due to a hamstring injury, they struggled to find a focal point in attack. (AAP) Hello. Plenty to get stuck into today, not least Showdown 47 at Adelaide Oval and the denouement to the Super Rugby season in Christchurch, so let\u2019s get straight into it.

Harper describes the film as one of his all-time favourites (the 1973 original, that is, not the Nicolas Cage remake). \u201cI love the idea of an isolated society that has so much joy at the centre of it, even with the brutality that exists in that world. It\u2019s so clearly a microcosm for humanity. That was one of the things we really latched onto here.\u201d</p> <p>From Harper\u2019s perspective, as the only American and just about the only person of colour in the cast, there\u2019s also a hint of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/19/get-out-review-jordan-peele-racism-america\" title=\"\">Get Out</a> to proceedings. Midsommar was actually shot in Hungary, not Sweden, with a primarily European cast and crew. \u201cI was completely out of my comfort zone for the entire two months that we were working,\u201d he says. \u201cI think if it had been somewhere in England, even though the cultures are drastically different, at least the shared language would have made me feel a little less isolated.\u201d They weren\u2019t actually in the middle of nowhere, but the purpose-built set was uncannily immersive. \u201cIt was very easy at times to let yourself be lost in this world that was constructed,\u201d he says. \u201cIn some ways it made it a little bit easier to just go in and give yourself to the experience.\u201d</p> <p>Has he ever attended a real pagan ritual? \u201cNo!\u201d he laughs, \u201cbut I did grow up super-religious, so I had an intense fear of it for a very long time. So going into this role was maybe \u2026 I wouldn\u2019t say it was a question of fear, but it was giving myself over to the questions that one would have if they were more open to these ideas that weren\u2019t steeped in a Judeo-Christian upbringing.\u201d</p> <p>As he expands with some authority on the nature of religion and belief, it is again difficult not to hear the Chidi in him. Midsommar is certainly a departure from The Good Place, but it seems as if the 39-year-old Harper is again playing a studious, academic type. \u201cAn academic, yes, but a very different guy. I feel like, in general, I have played in the past, sort of \u2026 smart characters.

      "bodyText": "William Jackson Harper is moving on from The Good Place, but you wouldn\u2019t exactly say he\u2019s going to a better place. Best known for his character in the hit afterlife sitcom \u2013 Chidi Anagonye, the charmingly awkward ethics professor who\u2019s more comfortable discussing the finer points of moral philosophy than actually acting on them \u2013 his next career move is far more sinister. Harper is starring in Ari Aster\u2019s new film, Midsommar, where he is trapped in the middle of the countryside for an onslaught of unsavoury pagan rituals. By coincidence, the same day we discuss Harper\u2019s new movie, it is announced that the fourth season of The Good Place, which he is now shooting, will be the last. \u201cIt\u2019s a gut punch but it\u2019s also the right move. It\u2019s really important to maintain artistic integrity,\u201d says Harper down the phone, with a hint of Chidi-style earnestness. Over the course of The Good Place so far, Chidi has died and been damned to hell multiple times, had his mind blown by witnessing a trillion different realities in the blink of an eye, and eaten his body weight in chilli mixed with marshmallow, all of which might be preferable to Harper\u2019s situation in Midsommar. The follow-up to Aster\u2019s breakout/freakout horror hit Hereditary, Midsommar brings a group of Americans to remotest rural Sweden \u2013 a land where everything is unsettlingly bright and white, from the perpetual daylight to the fair-haired villagers and the folksy dress code. \u201cI play a student of northern European summer solstice traditions,\u201d Harper explains. \u201cI\u2019m a real nut for odd pagan rituals and this is a great opportunity to go and observe one, so for me, this is like the trip of a lifetime.\u201d The final trip of his lifetime, perhaps? Judging by the trailer, things do not go well for him \u2013 what with the hallucinogens, the disembowelled bear, the hideously disfigured girl, and a clip of his character collapsing to the floor \u2013 but, says Harper, the less you know going in, the better. \u201cIt\u2019s not a fun romp in the forest, necessarily.\u201d Ari Aster has already cited film precedents for Midsommar, including Black Narcissus and Roman Polanski\u2019s Macbeth and Tess, but the most obvious comparison point is that foundation stone of folk-horror, The Wicker Man. Harper describes the film as one of his all-time favourites (the 1973 original, that is, not the Nicolas Cage remake). \u201cI love the idea of an isolated society that has so much joy at the centre of it, even with the brutality that exists in that world.

      "body": "<p>Jack Greenwell was born in Crook in the Durham coalfield in 1884. His career as a football player took in just two clubs: Crook Town and Barcelona. But as a coach he was a visionary, leading Bar\u00e7a for seven seasons before becoming an evangelist for the game in South America.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/04/peru-set-up-brazil-clash-in-copa-america-final-after-resounding-win-over-chile\">Peru set up Brazil clash in Copa Am\u00e9rica final after resounding win over Chile</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He died in Bogot\u00e1 in 1942, having suffered a heart attack while driving home from a training session.</p> <p>Marcos Calder\u00f3n was born in Lima in 1928. He also had a limited playing career, representing Carlos Concha and Sport Boys, and also achieved far greater renown as a coach, winning 10 league titles at four different clubs. He died in 1987, as a plane carrying his Alianza Lima side crashed into the Pacific near Callao.</p> <p>They were two men from very different backgrounds but they both led Peru to the Copa Am\u00e9rica. On Sunday Ricardo Gareca, as he leads Peru against Brazil in the final, could become the third. He was born in Tapiales, to the south-west of Buenos Aires, in 1958. He was an angular forward known as both as <em>el Flaco</em> (the Thin One) and <em>el Tigre</em> (the Tiger). He won 20 caps and played for Boca Juniors, River Plate, V\u00e9lez Sarsfield and Independiente as well as having a three-year stint in Colombia with Am\u00e9rica de Cal\u00ed.</p> <p>He was a much more accomplished player than either Greenwell or Calder\u00f3n but, like them, he has turned out to be a far better manager. He led Talleres to promotion, won a Peruvian title with Universitario and then returned to Argentina to lift three league titles with V\u00e9lez in a four-year spell. His football was perhaps too dogged to attract the attention of the grandes \u2013 and a brief stint with Independiente in 1997 started miserably and got worse \u2013 but his attitude was welcomed at el Fort\u00edn where, since the days of Victorio Spinetto, there has been a preference for fibra over flamboyance.</p> <p>In any reasonable world Gareca would at some point have been given his chance on the spinning carousel of the Argentina manager\u2019s job but there are few worlds less reasonable than that of Argentinian football administration. And perhaps he, now, prefers a world he can dominate, where he has control.</p> <p>The pragmatism that was successful at V\u00e9lez has been welcomed also with Peru who, in his four years in charge, have achieved heights unknown since the glory days of the seventies. In 2015 they reached the semi-finals of the Copa Am\u00e9rica. A year later they eliminated Brazil before losing to Ecuador on penalties in the quarter-final.

      "bodyText": "Jack Greenwell was born in Crook in the Durham coalfield in 1884. His career as a football player took in just two clubs: Crook Town and Barcelona. But as a coach he was a visionary, leading Bar\u00e7a for seven seasons before becoming an evangelist for the game in South America. He died in Bogot\u00e1 in 1942, having suffered a heart attack while driving home from a training session. Marcos Calder\u00f3n was born in Lima in 1928. He also had a limited playing career, representing Carlos Concha and Sport Boys, and also achieved far greater renown as a coach, winning 10 league titles at four different clubs. He died in 1987, as a plane carrying his Alianza Lima side crashed into the Pacific near Callao. They were two men from very different backgrounds but they both led Peru to the Copa Am\u00e9rica. On Sunday Ricardo Gareca, as he leads Peru against Brazil in the final, could become the third. He was born in Tapiales, to the south-west of Buenos Aires, in 1958. He was an angular forward known as both as el Flaco (the Thin One) and el Tigre (the Tiger). He won 20 caps and played for Boca Juniors, River Plate, V\u00e9lez Sarsfield and Independiente as well as having a three-year stint in Colombia with Am\u00e9rica de Cal\u00ed. He was a much more accomplished player than either Greenwell or Calder\u00f3n but, like them, he has turned out to be a far better manager. He led Talleres to promotion, won a Peruvian title with Universitario and then returned to Argentina to lift three league titles with V\u00e9lez in a four-year spell. His football was perhaps too dogged to attract the attention of the grandes \u2013 and a brief stint with Independiente in 1997 started miserably and got worse \u2013 but his attitude was welcomed at el Fort\u00edn where, since the days of Victorio Spinetto, there has been a preference for fibra over flamboyance. In any reasonable world Gareca would at some point have been given his chance on the spinning carousel of the Argentina manager\u2019s job but there are few worlds less reasonable than that of Argentinian football administration. And perhaps he, now, prefers a world he can dominate, where he has control. The pragmatism that was successful at V\u00e9lez has been welcomed also with Peru who, in his four years in charge, have achieved heights unknown since the glory days of the seventies. In 2015 they reached the semi-finals of the Copa Am\u00e9rica. A year later they eliminated Brazil before losing to Ecuador on penalties in the quarter-final. They then qualified for the World Cup for the first time since 1982. This is their first Copa Am\u00e9rica final since Calder\u00f3n\u2019s side beat Colombia (after home and away legs and a play-off in Caracas) in 1975. It has not, it should be acknowledged, necessarily been pretty. Nor have Peru been consistent. In the past year they have lost at home to Ecuador, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Colombia. There is an argument that they are better in tournaments, when Gareca has his players together for a protracted period and can drill them properly \u2013 but then they lost 5-0 to Brazil in the group stage, looking horribly vulnerable to set-plays. It was, admittedly, to all intents a dead rubber given Peru already had four points and the likelihood was that would be enough to go through as a best third-placed side (although the damage done to their goal-difference could have made it a close-run thing). And the first two Brazil goals were each freakish in their way.

      "body": "<p>Boris Johnson was still a backbench Conservative MP and Donald Trump was a property developer and reality television star in the summer that <em>Greetings from Bury Park</em> was published. It was June 2007. I was 36, a journalist and broadcaster living in London. The world I worked in was white, middle-class and metropolitan \u2013 a long way from the world in which I had been raised. I had grown up in Luton, the working-class son of Pakistani parents. My father arrived in Britain in 1963 and my mother followed 11 years later with their three children. I was almost three years old. Bury Park was the Asian district of Luton, and my father worked on the production line at the Vauxhall car factory while my mother was a seamstress at home. My childhood was defined by a lack of money and a vivid awareness that my future was limited by my class and my colour. When I managed to get to university and build a career in the media, it became apparent that what I had considered an ordinary upbringing was very different from those of the people I worked among.</p> <p>It was also striking that I never saw lives like mine depicted in popular culture or in books. Working-class lives, Muslim lives, lives defined by their apparent ordinariness. When I started working on a memoir, I did so with the ambition of opening up the world in which I had been raised. I pictured my mother, Rasool Bibi, walking along a street in Bury Park in her traditional <em>shalw</em><em>ar kameez</em>. What would a white person, someone who could not speak Urdu, think of her? What questions would they wish to ask her if they could? I set about writing my book with the hope that by writing very specifically I might tell a more universal story. Perhaps it was possible that sharing my family\u2019s history would help to normalise this immigrant tale, and confirm that stories like ours belonged within the larger narrative of British history.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The suggestion that, being brown-skinned and Muslim, I would never be fully British, was reinforced by my own parents</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The book was, at its heart, the story of a brown boy who desperately wanted to belong. I grew up at a time when racist football fans would run through Bury Park smashing shop windows and abusing anyone who happened to be on the street. My parents would warn me to get home before kick-off in case things kicked off. On television I would watch Tory politicians such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/norman-tebbit\" title=\"\">Norman Tebbit</a> question the loyalty of folks who looked like me. White boys would urinate through the letterbox of my friend Amolak\u2019s home. The suggestion that, being brown-skinned and Muslim, I would never be fully British, was reinforced by my own parents. My father would tell me that Pakistan was my true home even though I had left before I was three. He would say that white people would never accept me \u2013 there was no point in trying to integrate because I would never belong. Whenever I told myself or others that I was British, there was a nagging sense that I was a fraud. My right to say I belonged in this country felt fragile.</p> <p>It was not until the election of Tony Blair in 1997 that this fragility began to be replaced with some sense of ease and confidence. I vividly remember the Observer headline on the first weekend of the Blair government, declaring \u201cGoodbye Xenophobia\u201d. Nine months after Blair was elected, indie band Cornershop were No 1 in the singles charts with \u201cBrimful of Asha\u201d, a song about a female Bollywood singer. The old certainties seemed to be giving way to exciting new possibilities. By the time <em>Greetings from Bury Park</em> was published, I was convinced that the arc of British history was bending towards tolerance. I was wrong.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f768a310da0ca9a5408d5cc57e1d512c2d0cc370\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f768a310da0ca9a5408d5cc57e1d512c2d0cc370/229_0_3227_1936/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Luton life \u2026 from left: Kulvinder Ghir, Meera Ganatra and Viveik Kalra in Blinded by the Light.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luton life \u2026 from left: Kulvinder Ghir, Meera Ganatra and Viveik Kalra in Blinded by the Light.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Landmark Media/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The book was welcomed as an insight into the identity struggles for second generation British Muslims. After the 9/11 attacks there had been a spate of books \u2013 notably <em>The Islamist</em> by Ed Husain \u2013 that sought to understand Islamic radicalisation through personal stories. My story was also about rock music, specifically Bruce Springsteen (one of whose albums, <em>Greetings from Asbury Park,</em> inspired the title), which meant that it attracted readers new to books about the migrant experience. From a young age, I had sought escape in the work of American writers, television shows and in particular Springsteen\u2019s music. His songs reflected a working-class experience that echoed mine. He sang about fathers and sons with an honesty and empathy that made me reflect on my own relationship with my father. He also articulated a generous version of American patriotism that suggested the US was an inclusive and welcoming place. In America they hardly knew what Muslims were, I told myself, and had most likely never heard of Pakistan. If life in Britain became unbearable, there was always the US.</p> <p>And then came 9/11. In its aftermath my love for America waned. In the book I recount a conversation with Amolak, in which we resigned ourselves to the reality being over of the days when Americans barely knew what Muslims were. Yet, one year after <em>Greetings from Bury Park</em> was published, Barack Obama, then a state senator from Illinois, became the Democratic party\u2019s nominee for president. His victory that year restored my faith. The Obama presidency was confirmation, it seemed at the time, that in the US anyone could fulfil their dreams, even someone born to a Kenyan Muslim.</p> <p>The film option to my book was sold in 2012. It is hard to process how much the world has changed in the seven years since. The film, <em>Blinded by the Light,</em> will be released in August. Directed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gurinder-chadha\" title=\"\">Gurinder Chadha</a>, of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer_review/0,,683987,00.html\" title=\"\">Bend It Like Beckham</a></em> fame, and adapted by me, with Chadha and her husband Paul Mayeda Berges as co-writers, it is fictional but emotionally autobiographical. It stays loyal to the heart and soul of my book. The story is about identity and belonging, about parents and children and how we children of immigrants wish to stand on our own feet without trampling on our parents\u2019 hearts. It is also the story of the racism of my childhood and the possibility of change. I had hoped that the tales of my teenage years would, with each year, read more and more like a dispatch from a long gone era. Younger readers would greet them with horrified fascination and a renewed gratitude for how much things had changed. It turns out that things have not changed as much as I had hoped. The old fragility has returned.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a3775f88dc91bdc742ac88af386dc7c045528d77\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3775f88dc91bdc742ac88af386dc7c045528d77/0_567_2268_2835/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sarfraz Manzoor\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A quest to belong \u2026 Sarfraz Manzoor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the 12 years between my book being published and the film made, xenophobia has not only returned, it has become normalised. The racism that hovered ominously in the background of my teenage life, and sometimes in the foreground, has returned. In the days after a man ploughed into worshippers outside a mosque in Finsbury Park in 2017, only minutes from where I live, I had to take my daughter on a different route to her violin lesson, so she wouldn\u2019t see the aftermath of the attack. In my teenage years it was the National Front who marched through my hometown; now it is Britain First and the English Defence League. Tommy Robinson, another son of Luton, who founded the EDL, is welcomed into Ukip and Johnson, the man who may be our next prime minister, freely uses mocking language about Muslim women who wear niqabs. The right of anyone who is not white to say they are fully British is once again being challenged.</p> <p>So how will the film look to viewers today? Will the message of hope still resonate here, or in the US, where the election of Trump has overturned the happy ending of the Obama years? When it premiered at the Sundance festival, the film landed one of the biggest deals, for $15m from Warner Bros. Earlier this year I flew to Hollywood, Las Vegas and New York to attend preview screenings, and the responses of those who saw it were fascinating. After the Hollywood screening, a young woman approached me and told me she was raised in a Baptist community in Tennessee and had wanted to chase a dream of being a singer songwriter but her parents disapproved. \u201cYour story was my story,\u201d she told me. In New York I met a couple who had come for the Springsteen plotline, but had been affected by the story of a boy wanting to belong. They said they did not know anyone Muslim, but that I was \u201cbasically just a Pakistani version\u201d of them.</p> <p>We are living in a time when many of the battles I believed had been won are having to be refought. But the strongest weapon against those who seek to sow division is empathy. That this film is being made now, that it will reach audiences who haven\u2019t read the book, gives me a reason to feel hopeful.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Greetings from Bury Park by Sarfraz Manzoor is published by Bloomsbury. Blinded by the Light is released in cinemas on 9 August.</em></p>",

The old fragility has returned. In the 12 years between my book being published and the film made, xenophobia has not only returned, it has become normalised. The racism that hovered ominously in the background of my teenage life, and sometimes in the foreground, has returned. In the days after a man ploughed into worshippers outside a mosque in Finsbury Park in 2017, only minutes from where I live, I had to take my daughter on a different route to her violin lesson, so she wouldn\u2019t see the aftermath of the attack. In my teenage years it was the National Front who marched through my hometown; now it is Britain First and the English Defence League. Tommy Robinson, another son of Luton, who founded the EDL, is welcomed into Ukip and Johnson, the man who may be our next prime minister, freely uses mocking language about Muslim women who wear niqabs. The right of anyone who is not white to say they are fully British is once again being challenged. So how will the film look to viewers today? Will the message of hope still resonate here, or in the US, where the election of Trump has overturned the happy ending of the Obama years? When it premiered at the Sundance festival, the film landed one of the biggest deals, for $15m from Warner Bros. Earlier this year I flew to Hollywood, Las Vegas and New York to attend preview screenings, and the responses of those who saw it were fascinating. After the Hollywood screening, a young woman approached me and told me she was raised in a Baptist community in Tennessee and had wanted to chase a dream of being a singer songwriter but her parents disapproved. \u201cYour story was my story,\u201d she told me. In New York I met a couple who had come for the Springsteen plotline, but had been affected by the story of a boy wanting to belong. They said they did not know anyone Muslim, but that I was \u201cbasically just a Pakistani version\u201d of them. We are living in a time when many of the battles I believed had been won are having to be refought. But the strongest weapon against those who seek to sow division is empathy. That this film is being made now, that it will reach audiences who haven\u2019t read the book, gives me a reason to feel hopeful. \u2022 Greetings from Bury Park by Sarfraz Manzoor is published by Bloomsbury. Blinded by the Light is released in cinemas on 9 August.",

The groom\u2019s mother pointed to a picture of a man wearing a turban and asked him to mimic the style. As he got to work, stretching out the fabric, then stitching and tying the turban, Grewal was taken aback by how emotional the groom\u2019s mother and uncle became. The family were moved by the groom\u2019s resemblance to the man in the photo, who Grewal later learned was the groom\u2019s father \u2013 a former soldier in the Indian army who had died. \u201cI could relate to it because my dad isn\u2019t around and it was a tough moment,\u201d Grewal says.</p> <p>The 32-year-old runs Pagh Vala, a turban-tying service in London, with his friend and business partner Barinder Singh Bath.

It\u2019s the main part of the outfit and your face is going to be in pictures, so you have to get the turban right.\u201d He adds that he often works with \u201cdiva\u201d grooms who are quite fussy about styles and shapes.</p> <p>Dr Jasjit Singh of the University of Leeds, who studies religious and cultural transmission, says: \u201cCommunity elders thought that the younger generation would move away from their heritage, but what we\u2019re seeing is an increasing interest in understanding one\u2019s roots.\u201d</p> <p>Naroop Jhooti, 38, a London-based photographer and co-author of the book Turbans and Tales, says: \u201cForty years ago, wearing the turban meant you couldn\u2019t get the job, or could face racial abuse, so the older generation would wear black and didn\u2019t want to be noticed. They wanted to be able to fit in. But times are definitely changing. The younger generation are taking more pride in how their turbans look.\u201d</p> <p>Singh agrees there is a greater pressure on migrants to conform in the 1960s, but \u201cthose born and bred in Britain now are comfortable to say they are British and wearing a turban doesn\u2019t make them any less so.

I stand at the crossroads of a barrage of intersections and can feel fragmented at times. I am constantly defined as not white, not straight, not something, instead of being defined by what I am. I now understand pride as a celebration of otherness. To be proud of being queer is to be proud of shattering expectations and norms, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/04/under-the-rainbow-how-directors-make-lgbt-films-in-countries-hostile-to-gay-rights\">and embracing whatever expression</a>, whatever love, we need in order to feel whole.</p> <p><strong>When do you feel most at peace with your identity?</strong></p> <p>Bringing together those who I am in a community with by curating events like <a href=\"https://richmix.org.uk/events/the-hen-nah-party/?fbclid=IwAR0hqX4qhQ1l1e9hljFjLq5dHCloM9syVMbnJBQG9TGOztAmX3knDjiYkD4\">The Hen-nah Party</a> and platforming as many queer South Asians and people of colour as possible. When you\u2019re able to speak and know that your words are being met with open hearts and minds, you can talk about identity in more interesting ways. Running these events has allowed me to come to terms with my \u201clabels\u201d. Instead of thinking \u201cI\u2019m a woman first, I\u2019m queer first, I\u2019m Muslim first\u201d, I now understand that I can be all of these things at once. I\u2019ve learned to stop viewing this identity as something fragmented and instead celebrate it for what it is: rich, multifaceted, and something <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/30/new-york-pride-parade-lgbtq-rights\">to be truly proud of</a>.</p> <p><strong>How do you centre yourself when you\u2019re having a bad day?</strong></p> <p>A good friend of mine taught me a trick. Draw a grid with three columns and ten rows. The columns are for small, medium and large things you can do to feel good. Small for me is making mint tea or a hot water bottle, medium is cooking a proper meal or reading a chapter of a book, and large is going to a museum or open mic night with a friend. You have to do one thing from each column, and at least one of them has to be with another person. The small and medium things help me check in with my body \u2013 am I fed, hydrated and comfortable? The big things help me check in with my mind.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s your hope for the future?</strong></p> <p>That difference is no longer simply tolerated, but celebrated.</p> <h2><strong>Philip Rescorla OBE, 71, retired civil servant</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"a23a5cd12220ede4668f781d0d52507095591bfe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a23a5cd12220ede4668f781d0d52507095591bfe/0_0_3648_5472/667.jpg\" alt=\"Philip Rescorla\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philip Rescorla.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eleni Stefanou</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Can you recall a moment when you felt completely at peace with your identity?</strong></p> <p>Singing with my partner and my choir, <a href=\"https://www.pinksingers.co.uk/\">The Pink Singers,</a> at the opening ceremony of an LGBT+ festival in San Jose, California for the largest gay and lesbian choral event in history. It was humbling to be surrounded by so many singers from all walks of life, many of whom had been treated harshly by their family, employers and community because of their sexuality. In this moment they could be themselves and feel united with people who had gone through similar experiences. Singing songs like Something Inside so Strong and I Will Survive was very uplifting. </p> <p><strong>How would you describe Pride for anyone who hasn\u2019t been?</strong></p> <p>You will find yourself surrounded by love, acceptance, joy and the realisation that we are everywhere! Pride gives the community the chance to celebrate, show visibility and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/02/lil-nas-x-coming-out-lgbt-lessons-schools-gay\">support people still coming out</a>.</p> <p><strong>How do you centre yourself when you\u2019re having a bad day?</strong></p> <p>I remember my mother\u2019s advice: never lose your nerve. If you do, you panic and become too afraid to do what you were about to do. My mother believed you should always have a go at something.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s your hope for the future?</strong></p> <p>That we make worldwide progress on the decriminalisation of same-sex relations, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/02/mps-in-fresh-attempt-to-extend-equal-marriage-to-northern-ireland\">implementing effective anti-discrimination measures</a> and ensuring legal recognition of gender identity.

A celebration of the huge diversity of human gender and sexuality, and of the lives of LGBT+ people, and a protest at the injustice, prejudice and discrimination we face for being part of that minority. So the feelings are mixed: joy and anger, hope and frustration, excitement and contemplation.</p> <p><strong>Can you recall a moment when you felt completely at peace with your identity?</strong></p> <p>I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt at peace with it. I don\u2019t see that as a problem, more as an expression of the flux and fluidity that my identity has gone through.</p> <p><strong>How would you describe Pride for anyone who hasn\u2019t been?</strong></p> <p>I remember my first Pride (in 94 or 95 I think) as a student coming to London with a group of friends and being blown away by the sheer number of people, the cheers, whistles, drums and sound systems, and the incredible joy of the event. I had just begun my transition as a young trans woman and remember feeling so free and liberated amongst all these people. We were protesting against the awful prejudice that was widespread; we still had <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_28\">section 28 </a>in force at that time. That made me understand that there was more to Pride than just a big party.</p> <p><strong>How do you centre yourself when you\u2019re having a bad day?</strong></p> <p>I\u2019m naturally an introvert so I find my peace through solitude. Finding somewhere quiet to retreat, meditate or just be alone.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s your hope for the future?</strong></p> <p>A world where we as human beings can live together harmoniously with ourselves and with our planet.</p> <h2><strong>Freddy McConnell, 33, writer and Guardian journalist</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"282a1856c773d052ca827db3169990e643c9a4a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/282a1856c773d052ca827db3169990e643c9a4a4/0_0_3184_4776/667.jpg\" alt=\"Freddy McConnell\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Freddy McConnell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eleni Stefanou</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>When you hear the word </strong><strong>pride</strong><strong>, what feelings does it call up for you?</strong></p> <p>As a trans person in the UK right now, it feels like a call to action. Brave and defiant action, not just a feeling. Pride despite relentless attack from the media, the political right and a vociferous minority, supposedly on the left. Pride despite rising populist hostility to LGBT+ people the world over. Pride as a united front because homophobia, misogyny, racism and transphobia are all variations on the same hate-filled, shame-ridden theme.</p> <p><strong>Can you recall a moment when you felt completely at peace with your identity?</strong></p> <p>Before starting to transition, I realised that my path in life really was mine alone to choose. I stopped needing permission or a magical ability to know my future, and felt relief, followed by peace and clarity. I still have that peace, but living openly as trans means it gets battered and bruised. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/feb/18/munroe-bergdorf-the-more-trans-models-become-visible-the-more-they-become-normalised\">Munroe Bergdorf </a>recently said: \u201cThe best thing about being trans is being trans. The worst thing about being trans is other people.\u201d</p> <p><strong>How would you describe Pride for anyone who hasn\u2019t been?</strong></p> <p>It feels so special, almost magical, because you never get to be surrounded by people who experience life in similar ways to you. For me, it\u2019s about savouring just <em>being</em> together, acknowledging each other, feeling safety and strength in numbers, and sensing what\u2019s truly possible.</p> <p><strong>How do you centre yourself when you\u2019re having a bad day?</strong></p> <p> Sitting on a wide open beach tends to force things into perspective. Also, when you have a toddler, it\u2019s useful to ask yourself whether they care about the thing you\u2019re fretting about because the answer is almost certainly \u201cno\u201d.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s your hope for the future?</strong></p> <p>That children like mine never have to question the pride they feel in themselves and their rainbow families. I hope his whole generation is empowered to implement the radical changes needed to save the natural world and we get out of their way.</p> <h2><strong>Otamere Guobadia, 24, writer</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13cbc87c19c16fa1f7679a1c54d4d919bddbd33d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13cbc87c19c16fa1f7679a1c54d4d919bddbd33d/0_0_3648_5472/667.jpg\" alt=\"Otamere Guobadia\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Otamere Guobadia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eleni Stefanou</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>How would you define the term </strong><strong>pride</strong><strong>?</strong></p> <p>Pride is the vital, gorgeous and frantic celebration at the centre of our revolution. It is about resistance, perseverance and survival, but it is also about connection and queer joy.</p> <p><strong>Can you recall a moment when you felt completely at peace with your identity?</strong></p> <p>The times I\u2019ve revelled most in my identity have been when I\u2019m kissing friends and lovers and strangers in queer clubs: a dancing, kaleidoscopic shower of lights, campy disco and intimacy. There\u2019s no room for shame, just the glorious consonance of loving freely; the rightness, the desirousness, and the music of it.</p> <p><strong>How would you describe Pride to someone who hasn\u2019t been?</strong></p> <p>Riotous, joyful, colourful. The most pleasant kind of chaos.</p> <p><strong>How do you centre yourself when you\u2019re having a bad day?</strong></p> <p>Big dinners with people I love; reread passages from my favourite writers; hot showers; dirty martinis; fresh sheets; dancing!</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s your hope for the future?</strong></p> <p>That queerness does away with our binaries, our bizarre fixation on fixedness. My hope for the future is that it is truly, unabashedly queer. Queerness is evidence of more. It is a peek into the cauldron at the beginning of the universe. Evidence that we, in acting purportedly \u201cagainst nature\u201d, might ourselves expand it. It is evidence of the divine. Queerness is water from the stone, Lazarus from the depths, something from nothing.</p> <h2><strong>Ayla Zoe Louise Holdom, 38, helicopter pilot with the National Police Air Service</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e11081f0c3e7c6e64f52bb582c2503c003ed075\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e11081f0c3e7c6e64f52bb582c2503c003ed075/0_0_3648_5472/667.jpg\" alt=\"Ayla Zoe Louise Holdom\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ayla Zoe Louise Holdom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eleni Stefanou</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>When you hear the word </strong><strong>pride</strong><strong>, what feelings does it call up for you?</strong></p> <p>Transgender people have begun to have the sort of pride in themselves that they can share with the rest of the world , but only really in the last decade.

It\u2019s positive defiance to anyone who challenges our right to live, love and succeed just as we are and without apology.</p> <p><strong>Can you recall a moment when you felt completely at peace with your identity?</strong></p> <p>Flying my helicopter, I guess.

I stand at the crossroads of a barrage of intersections and can feel fragmented at times. I am constantly defined as not white, not straight, not something, instead of being defined by what I am. I now understand pride as a celebration of otherness. To be proud of being queer is to be proud of shattering expectations and norms, and embracing whatever expression, whatever love, we need in order to feel whole. When do you feel most at peace with your identity? Bringing together those who I am in a community with by curating events like The Hen-nah Party and platforming as many queer South Asians and people of colour as possible. When you\u2019re able to speak and know that your words are being met with open hearts and minds, you can talk about identity in more interesting ways. Running these events has allowed me to come to terms with my \u201clabels\u201d. Instead of thinking \u201cI\u2019m a woman first, I\u2019m queer first, I\u2019m Muslim first\u201d, I now understand that I can be all of these things at once. I\u2019ve learned to stop viewing this identity as something fragmented and instead celebrate it for what it is: rich, multifaceted, and something to be truly proud of. How do you centre yourself when you\u2019re having a bad day? A good friend of mine taught me a trick. Draw a grid with three columns and ten rows. The columns are for small, medium and large things you can do to feel good. Small for me is making mint tea or a hot water bottle, medium is cooking a proper meal or reading a chapter of a book, and large is going to a museum or open mic night with a friend. You have to do one thing from each column, and at least one of them has to be with another person. The small and medium things help me check in with my body \u2013 am I fed, hydrated and comfortable? The big things help me check in with my mind. What\u2019s your hope for the future? That difference is no longer simply tolerated, but celebrated. Philip Rescorla OBE, 71, retired civil servant Can you recall a moment when you felt completely at peace with your identity? Singing with my partner and my choir, The Pink Singers, at the opening ceremony of an LGBT+ festival in San Jose, California for the largest gay and lesbian choral event in history. It was humbling to be surrounded by so many singers from all walks of life, many of whom had been treated harshly by their family, employers and community because of their sexuality. In this moment they could be themselves and feel united with people who had gone through similar experiences. Singing songs like Something Inside so Strong and I Will Survive was very uplifting. How would you describe Pride for anyone who hasn\u2019t been? You will find yourself surrounded by love, acceptance, joy and the realisation that we are everywhere! Pride gives the community the chance to celebrate, show visibility and support people still coming out. How do you centre yourself when you\u2019re having a bad day? I remember my mother\u2019s advice: never lose your nerve. If you do, you panic and become too afraid to do what you were about to do. My mother believed you should always have a go at something. What\u2019s your hope for the future? That we make worldwide progress on the decriminalisation of same-sex relations, implementing effective anti-discrimination measures and ensuring legal recognition of gender identity. That we continue to break down the myths, lies and stereotypes about queer people and get the chance to tell our own stories. Kate Nambiar, 45, doctor When you hear the word pride, what feelings does it call up for you? For me it\u2019s both a celebration and a protest. A celebration of the huge diversity of human gender and sexuality, and of the lives of LGBT+ people, and a protest at the injustice, prejudice and discrimination we face for being part of that minority. So the feelings are mixed: joy and anger, hope and frustration, excitement and contemplation. Can you recall a moment when you felt completely at peace with your identity? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt at peace with it. I don\u2019t see that as a problem, more as an expression of the flux and fluidity that my identity has gone through. How would you describe Pride for anyone who hasn\u2019t been? I remember my first Pride (in 94 or 95 I think) as a student coming to London with a group of friends and being blown away by the sheer number of people, the cheers, whistles, drums and sound systems, and the incredible joy of the event. I had just begun my transition as a young trans woman and remember feeling so free and liberated amongst all these people. We were protesting against the awful prejudice that was widespread; we still had section 28 in force at that time. That made me understand that there was more to Pride than just a big party. How do you centre yourself when you\u2019re having a bad day? I\u2019m naturally an introvert so I find my peace through solitude. Finding somewhere quiet to retreat, meditate or just be alone. What\u2019s your hope for the future? A world where we as human beings can live together harmoniously with ourselves and with our planet. Freddy McConnell, 33, writer and Guardian journalist When you hear the word pride, what feelings does it call up for you? As a trans person in the UK right now, it feels like a call to action. Brave and defiant action, not just a feeling. Pride despite relentless attack from the media, the political right and a vociferous minority, supposedly on the left. Pride despite rising populist hostility to LGBT+ people the world over. Pride as a united front because homophobia, misogyny, racism and transphobia are all variations on the same hate-filled, shame-ridden theme. Can you recall a moment when you felt completely at peace with your identity? Before starting to transition, I realised that my path in life really was mine alone to choose. I stopped needing permission or a magical ability to know my future, and felt relief, followed by peace and clarity. I still have that peace, but living openly as trans means it gets battered and bruised. As Munroe Bergdorf recently said: \u201cThe best thing about being trans is being trans. The worst thing about being trans is other people.\u201d How would you describe Pride for anyone who hasn\u2019t been? It feels so special, almost magical, because you never get to be surrounded by people who experience life in similar ways to you. For me, it\u2019s about savouring just being together, acknowledging each other, feeling safety and strength in numbers, and sensing what\u2019s truly possible. How do you centre yourself when you\u2019re having a bad day? Sitting on a wide open beach tends to force things into perspective. Also, when you have a toddler, it\u2019s useful to ask yourself whether they care about the thing you\u2019re fretting about because the answer is almost certainly \u201cno\u201d. What\u2019s your hope for the future? That children like mine never have to question the pride they feel in themselves and their rainbow families. I hope his whole generation is empowered to implement the radical changes needed to save the natural world and we get out of their way. Otamere Guobadia, 24, writer How would you define the term pride? Pride is the vital, gorgeous and frantic celebration at the centre of our revolution. It is about resistance, perseverance and survival, but it is also about connection and queer joy. Can you recall a moment when you felt completely at peace with your identity? The times I\u2019ve revelled most in my identity have been when I\u2019m kissing friends and lovers and strangers in queer clubs: a dancing, kaleidoscopic shower of lights, campy disco and intimacy. There\u2019s no room for shame, just the glorious consonance of loving freely; the rightness, the desirousness, and the music of it. How would you describe Pride to someone who hasn\u2019t been? Riotous, joyful, colourful. The most pleasant kind of chaos. How do you centre yourself when you\u2019re having a bad day? Big dinners with people I love; reread passages from my favourite writers; hot showers; dirty martinis; fresh sheets; dancing! What\u2019s your hope for the future? That queerness does away with our binaries, our bizarre fixation on fixedness. My hope for the future is that it is truly, unabashedly queer. Queerness is evidence of more. It is a peek into the cauldron at the beginning of the universe. Evidence that we, in acting purportedly \u201cagainst nature\u201d, might ourselves expand it. It is evidence of the divine. Queerness is water from the stone, Lazarus from the depths, something from nothing. Ayla Zoe Louise Holdom, 38, helicopter pilot with the National Police Air Service When you hear the word pride, what feelings does it call up for you? Transgender people have begun to have the sort of pride in themselves that they can share with the rest of the world , but only really in the last decade. Pride means standing tall, with your LGBT+ family, with friends and allies. It\u2019s positive defiance to anyone who challenges our right to live, love and succeed just as we are and without apology. Can you recall a moment when you felt completely at peace with your identity? Flying my helicopter, I guess. When it\u2019s just me, my aircraft and the environment, there\u2019s a peace and a focus that transcends identity. I adore how tactile physics is in those moments and the beauty of an incredibly designed aircraft. How do you centre yourself when you\u2019re having a bad day? Cider. Wife. Cats. Garden! What\u2019s your hope for the future? For everyone to be less tense around identity \u2013 both their own and others. Humans are full of wonderful and natural variation, and we should welcome the ability to evolve without excess concern over how we categorise one another. It\u2019s a toolkit, not a rule book!",

      "body": "<p>For those readers of Jay Bernard\u2019s debut <em>Surge </em>who are not familiar with the historical event to which it responds, there is a carefully detailed author\u2019s foreword. On 18 January 1981, 13 black teenagers were killed in a house fire that engulfed a birthday party at 439 New Cross Road in south-east London. A subsequent apparent suicide, driven by grief, would bring the final death toll to 14. The cause of the New Cross Fire \u2013 it may have been a hate crime \u2013 has never been determined and the governmental silence that followed (prompting the refrain at the time \u201c13 dead, nothing said\u201d), in addition to hostile, haphazard official investigations, speaks to a long history of racism in Britain. Later that year, uprisings against police discrimination in Brixton, Toxteth and elsewhere would lead to a new era in black British history and identity.</p> <p>Although the fire, the subsequent protests and the founding of the Black People\u2019s Day of Action were documented by poets <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/27/linton-kwesi-johnson-brixton-windrush-myth-immigrants-didnt-want-fit-british-society-we-werent-allowed\" title=\"\">Linton Kwesi Johnson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/benjaminzephaniah\" title=\"\">Benjamin Zephaniah</a> among others, Bernard\u2019s work uniquely addresses a new generation encountering this past almost afresh, as it is echoed painfully in the present. A key element of the project is Bernard\u2019s exploration of black radical British history in the George Padmore Institute\u2019s archives, against the backdrop of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/grenfell-tower-fire\" title=\"\">Grenfell </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/grenfell-tower-fire\" title=\"\">Tower</a> tragedy, the xenophobia of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\" title=\"\">Windrush scandal</a> and Brexit. This interrogation of the tensions between \u201cpublic narration and private truths\u201d is found throughout <em>Surge</em>. Bernard, who uses the gender-neutral pronoun \u201cthey\u201d, reminds us that the self is an overlaying of multiple identities, comprised not just of what is remembered and forgotten, but of how one is located in the wider questions of belonging, memory and solidarity.</p> <p>In the poems \u201cArk\u201d and \u201cArk II\u201d Bernard draws the lyric subject into a complex relation with the past and present. \u201cArk\u201d describes the materiality of the archive\u2019s documents \u2013 audio and video recordings, press cuttings and photos, some of which are reproduced here as artefacts. where to put the burning house, the child made ash, the brick in the back of the neck, the shit in the letter box and piss up the side of it? // I file it under <em>fire, corpus, body, house</em>.</p> <p><em>I take this January morning in my hands and wonder if it should go under London, England, Britain, British, Black-British \u2013</em></p> <p><em>where to put the burning house, the child made ash, the brick in the back of the neck, the shit in the letter box and piss up the side of it?</em></p> <p><em>I file it under fire, corpus, body, house.</em></p> <p>Bernard weaves the fragility of the archive\u2019s contents with an expanded definition of the archive itself: a body of knowledge that is housed and organised according to the inclusive and exclusive laws of provenance and belonging.

      "bodyText": "For those readers of Jay Bernard\u2019s debut Surge who are not familiar with the historical event to which it responds, there is a carefully detailed author\u2019s foreword. On 18 January 1981, 13 black teenagers were killed in a house fire that engulfed a birthday party at 439 New Cross Road in south-east London. A subsequent apparent suicide, driven by grief, would bring the final death toll to 14. The cause of the New Cross Fire \u2013 it may have been a hate crime \u2013 has never been determined and the governmental silence that followed (prompting the refrain at the time \u201c13 dead, nothing said\u201d), in addition to hostile, haphazard official investigations, speaks to a long history of racism in Britain. Later that year, uprisings against police discrimination in Brixton, Toxteth and elsewhere would lead to a new era in black British history and identity. Although the fire, the subsequent protests and the founding of the Black People\u2019s Day of Action were documented by poets Linton Kwesi Johnson and Benjamin Zephaniah among others, Bernard\u2019s work uniquely addresses a new generation encountering this past almost afresh, as it is echoed painfully in the present. A key element of the project is Bernard\u2019s exploration of black radical British history in the George Padmore Institute\u2019s archives, against the backdrop of the Grenfell Tower tragedy, the xenophobia of the Windrush scandal and Brexit. This interrogation of the tensions between \u201cpublic narration and private truths\u201d is found throughout Surge. Bernard, who uses the gender-neutral pronoun \u201cthey\u201d, reminds us that the self is an overlaying of multiple identities, comprised not just of what is remembered and forgotten, but of how one is located in the wider questions of belonging, memory and solidarity. In the poems \u201cArk\u201d and \u201cArk II\u201d Bernard draws the lyric subject into a complex relation with the past and present. \u201cArk\u201d describes the materiality of the archive\u2019s documents \u2013 audio and video recordings, press cuttings and photos, some of which are reproduced here as artefacts. where to put the burning house, the child made ash, the brick in the back of the neck, the shit in the letter box and piss up the side of it? // I file it under fire, corpus, body, house. I take this January morning in my hands and wonder if it should go under London, England, Britain, British, Black-British \u2013 where to put the burning house, the child made ash, the brick in the back of the neck, the shit in the letter box and piss up the side of it? I file it under fire, corpus, body, house. Bernard weaves the fragility of the archive\u2019s contents with an expanded definition of the archive itself: a body of knowledge that is housed and organised according to the inclusive and exclusive laws of provenance and belonging. Where, the poet asks, does the body sit across the categorisations of national, local and ethnic identities if the traumas of personal and systemic violence make being at home impossible? The fire becomes an existential threat beyond its historical moment, and the ephemera lovingly preserved in the archive become an ark in the flood of time. This metaphor is extended in the prose poem \u201cArk II\u201d: \u201cNight meets me near Ladbroke Grove / with a warm June morning in my hands / in the story I am trying to tell / what doesn\u2019t fit is part of the hole\u201d. Here the morning of the first poem has turned to darkness, and the winter of New Cross becomes the summer of Grenfell. To tell the whole of \u2013 or explain the \u201chole\u201d in \u2013 the story requires justice for those who have died. In spite of the traces of memory and the mourning rituals of commemoration, the truth \u201clives inside the house\u201d and may never be known. Similarly, \u201cSongbook\u201d and \u201cSongbook II\u201d draw on musical forms associated with transatlantic black culture and civil rights. The first poem, inspired by Johnson\u2019s dub poem \u201cNew Crass Massakah\u201d, originally appeared as part of Bernard\u2019s 2018 Ted Hughes prize-winning multimedia work, Surge: Side A. Here \u201cback\u201d, \u201cattack\u201d, \u201ctack\u201d (as in changing tactics) and \u201clack\u201d imperceptibly move from the party\u2019s celebratory reggae to the revolutionary anthems of race equality that would follow that fateful night.

      "body": "<p>In every city I\u2019ve lived, my sister has been the one to set up the printer, testing it by printing me the lyrics to George Michael\u2019s Freedom! \u201990. I am not the only grown woman entwined with their family, as I am not the only British person entwined with George Michael. When, in 2010, he drove his car through the wall of the Hampstead Snappy Snaps, the resulting hole was quickly daubed with the legend \u201cWHAM\u201d, by a local who meant it in a loving way. Walking to the underground, I saw it (as well as the aftermath and the commentary on the aftermath) after breakfast with the last man I dated, before I met my husband.</p> <p>Because I\u2019d seen his film (Animal Kingdom), and he\u2019d read my memoir (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/31/your-voice-my-head-emma-forrest-review\" title=\"\">Your Voice In My Head</a>), we had a strong idea of each other before we fell in love. Once we were together, music moved from headphones in walking cities to being blasted from his truck on LA highways. My soon-to-be husband began a rapid career ascendancy, as he endeavoured, simultaneously, to untangle me from my family. As we worked on the wording to our ketubah (Judaism\u2019s sacred prenuptial agreement) I could picture beside \u201c\u2026 according to the law of Moses and Israel\u201d, the calligraphed lyrics to Freedom! \u201990: <em>I won\u2019t let you down </em><em>/ I will not give you up!</em></p> <p>Though I\u2019d left home at 16, it felt, in many ways, as if it was only just happening. On hearing me plead my case to my father for why I shouldn\u2019t have to invite a relative I didn\u2019t like to the wedding, Ben took the phone from me. I heard my dad, in clipped John Cleese tones, politeness enveloping a core of near\u2011demented frustration: \u201cIt may not be pleasant, but you have to. We had to invite family we didn\u2019t want to our wedding \u2013 it\u2019s just how weddings work.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh, nah mate,\u201d Ben answered, fanning out his Aussie accent like a card trick. \u201cNah. That ain\u2019t gonna happen\u201d, and hung up on him. Like many families from minority-ethnic backgrounds, mine is loud. Here was someone who was far louder.</p> <p>But DMX is loud and <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0867694/\" title=\"\">Topol</a> is also loud and they\u2019re different \u2013 and you\u2019d be resentful, on marrying, if your concept of how loudness should feel was one and you got the other. <em>May not be what you want from me / Just the way it\u2019s got to be</em>.</p> <p>One of the things I absolutely loved about Ben was that when he did not like a much-lauded film, rather than saying, \u201cI find I am not connecting with this jazz drummer\u2019s emotional journey\u201d, he instead ejected the DVD, spat on it, opened the window, threw the DVD out, closed the window, then opened the window and leaned out to spit on it again.</p> <p>One of the lows was me trying to finish a breastfeeding session with our three-week-old and him playing Wild For The Night by A$AP Rocky feat Skrillex over and over from tinny laptop speakers turned to their highest volume. Thereafter, I came to imagine that any vile event in our marriage featured Skrillex. But that day, topless and trapped under my suckling infant, I simply spat as far as I could in the direction of the laptop. The spit landed on the keyboard. \u201cOh my God,\u201d shouted Ben. \u201cI love you! I love you so much!\u201d Did he love my anger, my focus, my aim? I don\u2019t think he knew why he loved me, just that we had a primal connection. I felt the same. I followed his scent from room to room.</p> <p>Neither is it lost on me that the heights of our love are both to do with spit. I think about the English phrase \u201cHolding it together with spit and glue\u201d, which is another way of saying hanging on by a thread. We hung by a thread for years.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As a married couple, we were a Tennessee Williams first draft (featuring Skrillex)</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou\u2019re shouting!\u201d I\u2019d cry, and he\u2019d answer, \u201cI\u2019m not shouting, I\u2019m Australian.\u201d He still thinks I am too easily startled and I still think he is too quick to anger. This is the circle in which we dance and always did. As a married couple, we were a Tennessee Williams first draft (feat Skrillex). Or as he put it, he was Wreck-It Ralph and I was Vanellope, the girl with a glitch.</p> <p>In early 2016, I had the nagging feeling that we were going to have to call time. And though I was very worried, I had an even bigger nagging feeling. I had become fixated on the health of George Michael. This could have been Cassandra-style foresight, or, given his lifestyle, just pragmatism. Either way, I wanted George to know how much his music meant to me. I wrote the letter, but didn\u2019t mail it and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/11/david-bowie-dies-at-the-age-of-69\" title=\"\">David Bowie died</a> instead.</p> <p>Ben and I are both autodidacts who dropped out of high school. The last school exam I sat was history GCSE where I was required to write an essay about the golden years of the Weimar republic. Unprepared, I panicked and thought it would be OK to instead write an essay about Golden Years by David Bowie. I tell you this because it\u2019s one of Ben\u2019s favourite stories about me, something he enjoyed hearing when he felt tender.</p> <p>We had just got back from watching Ben not win a Golden Globe for <a href=\"https://www.goldenglobes.com/tv-show/bloodline\" title=\"\">Bloodline</a> when the news came through. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s more unsettling to get bad news naked or in black tie, but we listened to his songs late into the night and the marriage hung on. When it emerged that Bowie had known he only had a year to live and had thrown himself into completing an album, I thought about knowing you\u2019re going to die and knowing that the thing you must do is work. I thought about how to leave a legacy inside the marriage in the likelihood it would soon be gone.</p> <p>When we first met, I\u2019d written the script for Untogether, a film charting how something you\u2019re determined to leave as a one-night stand arcs, against your wishes, into a love story. I wrote the role of Martin for Ben, to showcase his guileless, joyful side, the half of him that is Iggy Pop just wanting to be your dog. It felt important to get it filmed before we ended up divorcing. After a decade as a screenwriter, it would be my first film as director. As financing finally fell into place, partly as a result of Ben\u2019s participation, I realised I\u2019d have to direct my husband as we were pulling apart.</p> <p>I almost scuppered it late one night during a tense disagreement about parenting. This was really it, we were breaking up then and there, film be damned \u2013 when someone with a flashlight approached our home. Ben grabbed a long kitchen knife and ran outside, shouting: \u201cGet the fuck off my property! I will fucking gut you!\u201d</p> <p>We held each other and trembled and were so glad not to have broken up, to be held by spit and glue, that it took until the next day to realise: \u201cBen, it wasn\u2019t the meal delivery service, was it?\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d He said. \u201cOh dear. You should probably call to apologise.\u201d</p> <p>After another fight, my daughter and I went to a friend\u2019s beach cottage for two weeks, the longest time Ben and I had spent apart. While we were there, Prince died. These musicians we loved so much, who had been our sacred texts on dark nights of the soul, were dying, while we were dying on the inside.</p> <p>***</p> <p>I had a very different relationship with loneliness when I was younger. I lived my life in walking cities (London and then New York) where my mood could be best summarised as \u201cmusic heard through headphones\u201d and loneliness was something I let melt under my tongue like a sucking sweet, combating the cabin air pressure of my head.</p> <p>With many, many swear words in his arsenal, \u201cHow lonely\u201d is Ben\u2019s most frequent insult. It could apply to everything from a denim jacket sold with pre-applied patches, to a misguided nickname, to a poorly considered For Your Consideration campaign. Loneliness is the greatest damnation he can assign to a person, place or thing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0953462f6473b685c444a4322ed01d66c8903fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0953462f6473b685c444a4322ed01d66c8903fb/526_0_3744_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emma Forrest with Ben Mendelsohn in 2012\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Ben Mendelsohn in 2012: \u2018How do you look at someone whose clothes you once wanted to tear off, when there is laundry to be done?\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hugh Hamilton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I remember walking down to the beach, looking out at the Pacific, thinking, \u201cI don\u2019t want to end up lonely, but if we don\u2019t end this marriage that needs to end, the icons of our youth will keep dying before their time.\u201d (It is the artist\u2019s way to believe that they are useless pieces of shit, but that they also control the oceans. Ben understood that.)</p> <p>Some friends thought I should let the film fall away and focus on splitting, but the shots my cinematographer and I had planned gnawed at me as I slept, when I bathed, as I carried shopping from the grocery store. Maybe because it was my version of an optimistic love story, I believed I would simply not be OK if I didn\u2019t film it. And that it would mean something to some people were it to see the light of day.</p> <p>The night before my first morning on set, I called my writer-director friend Shana, needing to say out loud what I\u2019d been holding in: that I didn\u2019t want to direct this film any more because I didn\u2019t want to be on this planet any more. As I sobbed, she gave me the best advice I ever got about film-making: \u201cNobody ever gets to direct a film. Women never, ever get to. You\u2019re going to make this movie and on the last day, you can have a nervous breakdown and check into a psych ward for 10 days, because that\u2019s how long it will take for your editor to cut the first assembly.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I told him about George Michael, he put me on his knee and I leaned on his chest and we both cried</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I was held up in every way by my crew and my cast (with perfect Fleetwood Mac synchronicity, my leading lady, Jemima Kirke, was also getting divorced). One of my favourite days was lifting a scene from the Freedom! \u201990 video (Jemima angled like Cindy Crawford in the bathtub, elevated by wooden planks, as I\u2019d heard its director David Fincher had done). It was a 20\u2011day shoot with a few hours\u2019 sleep a night. By the end, my face appeared to have melted, like the proverbial cake left in the rain. When I was directing Ben \u2013 on the days he shot and only those days \u2013 I put on mascara and it was\u2026 How lonely. To care how you look in front of someone who you don\u2019t want to be with and who does not want to be with you.</p> <p>The day after the November 2016 US election was the only time I cried at work. The idea that you wake up and are a country utterly divided \u2013 we think they\u2019re the terrible people and they think we\u2019re the terrible people \u2013 felt like the global parallel to my domestic reality. Jamie Dornan, who acts opposite Jemima, clocked my face as we returned from our trailers \u2013 I\u2019d say Girl With A Glitch meets Tennessee Williams\u2019s bulldog mourning at his grave while Skrillex plays \u2013 and wordlessly wrapped me in a bear hug as I said \u201cThank you\u201d and \u201cSorry\u201d, took a breath and shot the next scene.</p> <p>Leonard Cohen\u2019s passing actually came as a moment of respite. Of all the celebrity deaths of 2016, it is the only one that can be described as a good death. Leonard, one senses, simply meditated himself off this plain, a peaceful protest against the state of the nation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbafcd2c17b11a469c5b3add8a402db6f8fa7629\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbafcd2c17b11a469c5b3add8a402db6f8fa7629/38_37_2252_2813/801.jpg\" alt=\"Forrest directing Lola Kirke (sister and co-star of Jemima) and Ben Mendelsohn on the set of Untogether.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Forrest directing Lola Kirke (sister and co-star of Jemima) and Ben Mendelsohn on the set of Untogether.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brad Frizzell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After we finished the film, Ben moved out to the place where I first knew him, a guesthouse at the top of Laurel Canyon in LA. He would come to put our daughter to bed a few times a week and we\u2019d orbit each other in silence, two waning moons. To hear him apologise when he walked in on me changing was crushing. How do you look at someone whose clothes you once wanted to tear off, when there is laundry to be done? How are you going to get divorced, especially with a child involved? Are you going to say, \u201cI find I am not connecting with this emotional journey\u201d? Or do you eject the marriage, spit on it and throw it out the window?

      "bodyText": "In every city I\u2019ve lived, my sister has been the one to set up the printer, testing it by printing me the lyrics to George Michael\u2019s Freedom! \u201990. I am not the only grown woman entwined with their family, as I am not the only British person entwined with George Michael. When, in 2010, he drove his car through the wall of the Hampstead Snappy Snaps, the resulting hole was quickly daubed with the legend \u201cWHAM\u201d, by a local who meant it in a loving way. Walking to the underground, I saw it (as well as the aftermath and the commentary on the aftermath) after breakfast with the last man I dated, before I met my husband. Because I\u2019d seen his film (Animal Kingdom), and he\u2019d read my memoir (Your Voice In My Head), we had a strong idea of each other before we fell in love. Once we were together, music moved from headphones in walking cities to being blasted from his truck on LA highways. My soon-to-be husband began a rapid career ascendancy, as he endeavoured, simultaneously, to untangle me from my family. As we worked on the wording to our ketubah (Judaism\u2019s sacred prenuptial agreement) I could picture beside \u201c\u2026 according to the law of Moses and Israel\u201d, the calligraphed lyrics to Freedom! \u201990: I won\u2019t let you down / I will not give you up! Though I\u2019d left home at 16, it felt, in many ways, as if it was only just happening. On hearing me plead my case to my father for why I shouldn\u2019t have to invite a relative I didn\u2019t like to the wedding, Ben took the phone from me. I heard my dad, in clipped John Cleese tones, politeness enveloping a core of near\u2011demented frustration: \u201cIt may not be pleasant, but you have to. We had to invite family we didn\u2019t want to our wedding \u2013 it\u2019s just how weddings work.\u201d \u201cAh, nah mate,\u201d Ben answered, fanning out his Aussie accent like a card trick. \u201cNah. That ain\u2019t gonna happen\u201d, and hung up on him. Like many families from minority-ethnic backgrounds, mine is loud. Here was someone who was far louder. But DMX is loud and Topol is also loud and they\u2019re different \u2013 and you\u2019d be resentful, on marrying, if your concept of how loudness should feel was one and you got the other. May not be what you want from me / Just the way it\u2019s got to be. One of the things I absolutely loved about Ben was that when he did not like a much-lauded film, rather than saying, \u201cI find I am not connecting with this jazz drummer\u2019s emotional journey\u201d, he instead ejected the DVD, spat on it, opened the window, threw the DVD out, closed the window, then opened the window and leaned out to spit on it again. One of the lows was me trying to finish a breastfeeding session with our three-week-old and him playing Wild For The Night by A$AP Rocky feat Skrillex over and over from tinny laptop speakers turned to their highest volume. Thereafter, I came to imagine that any vile event in our marriage featured Skrillex. But that day, topless and trapped under my suckling infant, I simply spat as far as I could in the direction of the laptop. The spit landed on the keyboard. \u201cOh my God,\u201d shouted Ben. \u201cI love you! I love you so much!\u201d Did he love my anger, my focus, my aim? I don\u2019t think he knew why he loved me, just that we had a primal connection. I felt the same. I followed his scent from room to room. Neither is it lost on me that the heights of our love are both to do with spit. I think about the English phrase \u201cHolding it together with spit and glue\u201d, which is another way of saying hanging on by a thread. We hung by a thread for years. \u201cYou\u2019re shouting!\u201d I\u2019d cry, and he\u2019d answer, \u201cI\u2019m not shouting, I\u2019m Australian.\u201d He still thinks I am too easily startled and I still think he is too quick to anger. This is the circle in which we dance and always did. As a married couple, we were a Tennessee Williams first draft (feat Skrillex). Or as he put it, he was Wreck-It Ralph and I was Vanellope, the girl with a glitch. In early 2016, I had the nagging feeling that we were going to have to call time. And though I was very worried, I had an even bigger nagging feeling. I had become fixated on the health of George Michael. This could have been Cassandra-style foresight, or, given his lifestyle, just pragmatism. Either way, I wanted George to know how much his music meant to me. I wrote the letter, but didn\u2019t mail it and David Bowie died instead. Ben and I are both autodidacts who dropped out of high school. The last school exam I sat was history GCSE where I was required to write an essay about the golden years of the Weimar republic. Unprepared, I panicked and thought it would be OK to instead write an essay about Golden Years by David Bowie. I tell you this because it\u2019s one of Ben\u2019s favourite stories about me, something he enjoyed hearing when he felt tender. We had just got back from watching Ben not win a Golden Globe for Bloodline when the news came through. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s more unsettling to get bad news naked or in black tie, but we listened to his songs late into the night and the marriage hung on. When it emerged that Bowie had known he only had a year to live and had thrown himself into completing an album, I thought about knowing you\u2019re going to die and knowing that the thing you must do is work. I thought about how to leave a legacy inside the marriage in the likelihood it would soon be gone. When we first met, I\u2019d written the script for Untogether, a film charting how something you\u2019re determined to leave as a one-night stand arcs, against your wishes, into a love story. I wrote the role of Martin for Ben, to showcase his guileless, joyful side, the half of him that is Iggy Pop just wanting to be your dog. It felt important to get it filmed before we ended up divorcing. After a decade as a screenwriter, it would be my first film as director. As financing finally fell into place, partly as a result of Ben\u2019s participation, I realised I\u2019d have to direct my husband as we were pulling apart. I almost scuppered it late one night during a tense disagreement about parenting. This was really it, we were breaking up then and there, film be damned \u2013 when someone with a flashlight approached our home. Ben grabbed a long kitchen knife and ran outside, shouting: \u201cGet the fuck off my property! I will fucking gut you!\u201d We held each other and trembled and were so glad not to have broken up, to be held by spit and glue, that it took until the next day to realise: \u201cBen, it wasn\u2019t the meal delivery service, was it?\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d He said. \u201cOh dear. You should probably call to apologise.\u201d After another fight, my daughter and I went to a friend\u2019s beach cottage for two weeks, the longest time Ben and I had spent apart. While we were there, Prince died. These musicians we loved so much, who had been our sacred texts on dark nights of the soul, were dying, while we were dying on the inside. *** I had a very different relationship with loneliness when I was younger. I lived my life in walking cities (London and then New York) where my mood could be best summarised as \u201cmusic heard through headphones\u201d and loneliness was something I let melt under my tongue like a sucking sweet, combating the cabin air pressure of my head. With many, many swear words in his arsenal, \u201cHow lonely\u201d is Ben\u2019s most frequent insult. It could apply to everything from a denim jacket sold with pre-applied patches, to a misguided nickname, to a poorly considered For Your Consideration campaign. Loneliness is the greatest damnation he can assign to a person, place or thing. I remember walking down to the beach, looking out at the Pacific, thinking, \u201cI don\u2019t want to end up lonely, but if we don\u2019t end this marriage that needs to end, the icons of our youth will keep dying before their time.\u201d (It is the artist\u2019s way to believe that they are useless pieces of shit, but that they also control the oceans. Ben understood that.) Some friends thought I should let the film fall away and focus on splitting, but the shots my cinematographer and I had planned gnawed at me as I slept, when I bathed, as I carried shopping from the grocery store. Maybe because it was my version of an optimistic love story, I believed I would simply not be OK if I didn\u2019t film it. And that it would mean something to some people were it to see the light of day. The night before my first morning on set, I called my writer-director friend Shana, needing to say out loud what I\u2019d been holding in: that I didn\u2019t want to direct this film any more because I didn\u2019t want to be on this planet any more. As I sobbed, she gave me the best advice I ever got about film-making: \u201cNobody ever gets to direct a film. Women never, ever get to. You\u2019re going to make this movie and on the last day, you can have a nervous breakdown and check into a psych ward for 10 days, because that\u2019s how long it will take for your editor to cut the first assembly.\u201d I was held up in every way by my crew and my cast (with perfect Fleetwood Mac synchronicity, my leading lady, Jemima Kirke, was also getting divorced). One of my favourite days was lifting a scene from the Freedom! \u201990 video (Jemima angled like Cindy Crawford in the bathtub, elevated by wooden planks, as I\u2019d heard its director David Fincher had done). It was a 20\u2011day shoot with a few hours\u2019 sleep a night. By the end, my face appeared to have melted, like the proverbial cake left in the rain. When I was directing Ben \u2013 on the days he shot and only those days \u2013 I put on mascara and it was\u2026 How lonely. To care how you look in front of someone who you don\u2019t want to be with and who does not want to be with you. The day after the November 2016 US election was the only time I cried at work. The idea that you wake up and are a country utterly divided \u2013 we think they\u2019re the terrible people and they think we\u2019re the terrible people \u2013 felt like the global parallel to my domestic reality. Jamie Dornan, who acts opposite Jemima, clocked my face as we returned from our trailers \u2013 I\u2019d say Girl With A Glitch meets Tennessee Williams\u2019s bulldog mourning at his grave while Skrillex plays \u2013 and wordlessly wrapped me in a bear hug as I said \u201cThank you\u201d and \u201cSorry\u201d, took a breath and shot the next scene. Leonard Cohen\u2019s passing actually came as a moment of respite. Of all the celebrity deaths of 2016, it is the only one that can be described as a good death. Leonard, one senses, simply meditated himself off this plain, a peaceful protest against the state of the nation. After we finished the film, Ben moved out to the place where I first knew him, a guesthouse at the top of Laurel Canyon in LA. He would come to put our daughter to bed a few times a week and we\u2019d orbit each other in silence, two waning moons. To hear him apologise when he walked in on me changing was crushing. How do you look at someone whose clothes you once wanted to tear off, when there is laundry to be done? How are you going to get divorced, especially with a child involved? Are you going to say, \u201cI find I am not connecting with this emotional journey\u201d? Or do you eject the marriage, spit on it and throw it out the window? Like most couples who were once deeply in love, we did both. On Christmas Day, I made blinis with caviar and he thanked me, politely. We were still not sure how to hug, so we didn\u2019t. Our kid ripped from present to present as if she were pollinating them, and Ben gingerly gave me a maritime-themed cushion with a removable octopus, a completely random gift that said, \u201cI have no idea what we are to each other any more.\u201d He was in the garden smoking when I read about George Michael. When I told him, he put me on his knee and I leaned on his chest and we both cried. I don\u2019t know if he was just relieved to see me crying not over our divorce. \u201cI said it would be him.\u201d He held me tighter: \u201cYou did. You did say it.\u201d \u201cIt just hurts so much,\u201d I gulped, \u201cthat someone who comforted so many people did not feel good about himself.\u201d Ben answered: \u201cThat\u2019s why we do what we do.\u201d Later, I remembered the way George\u2019s songs swing back and forth from a desperate yearning for closeness to a primal need for freedom. When we finished crying, we danced to his greatest hits, all three of us, and it was a beautiful Christmas. The next day I told my child\u2019s babysitter. A deeply empathetic woman, she just looked at me and asked: \u201cWhich one was he?\u201d \u201cGeorge. George Michael. English. Greek. Wham!? He wrote some of the most perfect songs in the history of pop. He had a big, big heart.\u201d She thought a long time before her eyes flooded with recognition: \u201cToilet Man?\u201d It felt like a sense memory from couples therapy: you could flood the world with beauty, yet only be remembered for your perceived transgressions. Carrie Fisher died before the year was done. Soon Ben and I would descend into six months of froideur as the financials got hammered out. The last time he was tender with me, he called to tell me about Debbie Reynolds. All he said was: \u201cMumma\u2019s gone now.\u201d I understood right away. I also understood he wanted to be the one to tell me, aware how entwined I am with the family he took me from and to whom he was returning me. The next time he visited, he was wearing new black wax jeans I couldn\u2019t make sense of, and the fact I couldn\u2019t make sense of them felt insurmountable (sometimes the clothes do not make the man). Around the time Tom Petty died twice in one day I was at my lowest. My kid and I left the east LA family home for a rental in north London while we tried to find our feet.

She only needs to hear a tune once to sing it perfectly. My mum sang with her and it was soothing to watch. I was glad to be re-entangled with my parents in a new way, all of us at different life stages. Every day at school, my daughter\u2019s class of five-year-olds began with them singing, If You Want To Sing Out by Cat Stevens. She had come to love it so much, and become so used to the singers we listen to being dead, that she summoned the courage to ask: \u201cIs Cat Stevens\u2026 is he dead?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I said. \u201cCat Stevens is alive.\u201d I didn\u2019t say: \u201cHe has transfigured.

One day, after dropping my daughter at school, I found myself wandering around Highgate. Eventually, I was at the cemetery, admiring the flowers and books at the graves of Karl Marx and Douglas Adams.

That\u2019s the offer from an ethical investment scheme that allows people to put money into companies providing African families with access to clean, affordable solar energy. It\u2019s notable that this scheme is supported by UK aid money from the Department for International Development (DfID), and offers a guarantee, although this only covers the first \u00a3100 of capital invested and applies to first-time investors. Energise Africa enables ordinary people to invest in bonds issued by solar companies, allowing them to provide \u201clife-changing\u201d solar home systems to low-income families in countries such as Kenya, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Tanzania. With a minimum investment of \u00a350 and expected annual returns that have in the past typically ranged from 5% to 7%, this is a potentially straightforward and accessible way for people to make sure their money is doing some good. And the guarantee on offer to new investors will definitely provide reassurance. However, above and beyond that guarantee, your capital is at risk, and the returns are not guaranteed. In the worst-case scenario, if there is some kind of disaster, crisis or bankruptcy, you could lose some or all of your capital and would not be able to get redress from the UK\u2019s Financial Services Compensation Scheme or complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service. So this is not going to be for everyone. Energise Africa was launched in 2017 and is the result of a link-up between Ethex, a UK-based ethical investment platform, and Lendahand, a Dutch-based crowdfunding platform.

      "body": "<h2>How did you get into journalism?</h2> <p>In some ways, by accident. I had a whole series of non jobs in my 20s and reached a point where I wondered how I could explain the gap in my CV, but I started freelancing. Around this time \u2013 1990 \u2013 print journalism was expanding, there were lots of supplements being born, and therefore plenty of work for freelancers. I sent a piece in to the Guardian on spec and it was used in the paper, and things took off from there. I was commissioned by the Independent on Sunday to write for their Education and Society supplement and gradually became a feature within their pages. Then the Guardian gave me a freelance contract, which required me to submit a certain number of words per year, so I had some job security. I started writing for G2 and got to know other Guardian editors, many of whom were kind enough to give me a chance at writing for them.</p> <h2>Do you remember your first day at the Guardian?</h2> <p>Yes, and I vividly recall feeling at home right from the start. I loved the people, and it was a great opportunity to learn the really useful practice of writing to deadlines. In the old days, you would pitch an idea and then have a week or so to write it up, but in the new world we only had a day or two, and it was a really useful discipline to master, because the turnaround for copy has just become faster and faster. At the time that I started, I was also writing for the Evening Standard and I wrote several books in the following years \u2013 on football, parenting, politics. In 2000 we created the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/series/digestedread\">Digested Read</a>, which I did for 19 years.</p> <h2>Which sketches are you proudest of?</h2> <p>It\u2019s hard to say. Things move so fast. In February 2014 when I took over, there wasn\u2019t a lot going on politically. We all knew the coalition was in trouble, but often proceedings in the house were spectacularly dull. But as journalists we have to be there for all weathers, and in my case, I quite enjoy creating comedy out of boredom. Some weeks it has felt as though I\u2019m trying to create something almost out of nothing, and others it feels as though every day is a major political event. The sketches in a way write themselves, but in many ways the world itself feels quite comedic and satirical at the moment, so I have to up my game.</p> <h2>What\u2019s the secret to a good political sketch?</h2> <p>I work very closely with the lobby team \u2013 they give me info and tidbits whenever they can. Andy Sparrow, who writes our politics live blog, is great at helping check back on some of the observations I\u2019ve made that day. But I\u2019m not there to report the facts \u2013 we have a very good lobby team to do that. My job is to draw out and portray the psychodrama, the subtext, the meta-politics. I try to work at a conscious level and a subsconscious level, and let events trickle down. It helps to really understand the machinations of Westminster, though \u2013 who likes who, who likes what, who are arch rivals \u2026 and try to create a dramatic subplot from that. In these \u201calternative fact\u201d times, the sketch has become more and more a form of truth-telling.</p> <h2>Have you had any response from readers regarding the sketch?</h2> <p>Readers have been overwhelmingly lovely. Initially, when I took over from Simon Hoggart, there was a suspicion of me, and scepticism I could live up to him \u2013 he was an institution who had been sketch writer for over 20 years. People have by and large now forgiven me for not being Simon Hoggart and realised I have a different style. Simon\u2019s comedy was more observational, mine is more satire. I think these are times that require satire. On a dull day, it\u2019s an entertaining diversion for readers, but the job of a sketch writer is also to be one of the ones who is holding power to account, and serving a moral purpose. A lot of people feel genuinely angry, misrepresented and disenfranchised right now.</p> <p>I think readers value the fact that the sketch is equal-opportunities. I focus on the government, but when Labour make arses of themselves, I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s my job to prop them up, spare them or toe the party line. It\u2019s not political or class warfare. A lot of Tory MPs are privately appalled by what is happening.</p> <h2>What have been the biggest challenges of your career?</h2> <p>To be recognised and heard. Initially I was put on articles to fill space in the various sections. There was so much advertising that sometimes there were up to 13 or 14 pages of Education editorial. No one had done the Digested Read before \u2013 it was Felicity Lawrence\u2019s idea. She had been editor of a section called Consumer, whose desk was next to mine, and she liked the way I wrote and thought I\u2019d be a great fit. Originally it was just a book a week and a short precis. We had a lot of fun doing parodies of style and a retelling of the book, so that it combined critical review with entertainment and added to the experience of reading the original work itself.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019ve started referring to Boris Johnson as Mr Blobby because there's something quite cartoonish and absurd about him</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I moved to G2 in 2007 and started writing a parody of the week in Westminster, before taking over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/series/the-politics-sketch\">the sketch</a> from Hoggart. It was absolutely terrifying taking over such a high profile gig. I was suddenly thrown out of the comfort of the office and sent to Westminster to work with a bunch of people I had only ever read in print \u2013 it was a steep and terrifying learning curve. 2015 was my first general election \u2013 I didn\u2019t know where I was supposed to be, but fortunately my colleagues were hugely helpful. With the sketch, I\u2019m writing for quite a sophisticated audience who know a lot about politics, especially now, when people have become so politicised, and I want to be able to add something to all that. There\u2019s still a lot to learn. When people talk about the Westminster bubble, that\u2019s absolutely spot on. A lot of the people I encounter are semi-detached from the rest of Britain, and even just from the rest of London.</p> <h2>What questions should we be asking the government, and how do you convey those questions in your sketches?</h2> <p>The big question is still Brexit. It has been so dominant in the political agenda, and it can be a struggle to write about the same topic for a long time and keep it interesting. Amid the repetition of the Brexit cycle, I started referring to May as \u201cMaybot\u201d \u2013 to describe her style of government and her character, and it was adopted into common parlance at other newspapers and TV channels. I\u2019ve recently started referring to Boris Johnson as Mr Blobby because there\u2019s something quite cartoonish and absurd about him. He is up in arms promising to \u201cdeliver Brexit\u201d but there\u2019s absolutely no detail there \u2013 we are completely in the dark about how he might do that, so I think we need to keep asking to what extent our politicians are being responsible for their actions. With so many big promises, it is guaranteed that at least one or two contingents of society are going to be sorely disappointed.</p> <h2>What is the Guardian\u2019s place amid all these changes?</h2> <p>We have a top, top team. We are one of the few papers which is genuinely independent, which means we are fair in both directions. And we have been proved right so many times. When May was touted as a strong woman who could deliver Brexit, the Guardian said \u201chang on, she doesn\u2019t have a plan!\u201d. We have never been a cheerleader for one side or the other, which probably irritates some people on occasion, but we\u2019re not there just to bash the Tories \u2013 and equally when I write something disobliging about Corbyn, I get stick for it. The point is we are responsible for holding these figures to account, no matter which side of the political spectrum they fall on.</p> <p><br></p>",

      "body": "<p>Beth and Peter Morrison remember every detail<strong> </strong>about the day their son Calum returned, broken, from Kingspark school. It was Friday 24 September 2010. The school bus dropped him home at 3.25pm. His face was ashen, his lips blue. He was wearing different clothes from those he had left in that morning \u2013 a thin T-shirt, shorts and plimsolls, no underwear and no coat. His own clothes were soaked in urine and stuffed in a plastic bag. \u201cI asked him what was wrong. He said: \u2018I dizzy, Mummy, teacher hurt,\u2019\u201d Beth says. Although Calum was 11 at the time, he still spoke like a toddler.</p> <p>Beth called the school immediately to find out what had happened. Beth says she was kept holding for more than 15 minutes before being told staff were in a meeting. That evening, Calum was clingy and tearful. \u201cAs I was tucking him in for the night, he said: \u2018No school, Mummy, school bad.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The next morning, when Beth was taking off his pyjamas, she noticed the bruises on his upper arms. She asked Calum about them. \u201cTeacher hurt arm. Wet on the floor,\u201d he said. She looked in the home-school diary \u2013 a logbook used by the school and Calum\u2019s parents to relay noteworthy incidents \u2013<strong> </strong>for clues as to what had happened. Nothing was recorded.</p> <p>We are sitting in the kitchen of the Morrisons\u2019 bungalow in a small coastal town near Dundee. Their home, which has been adapted to Calum\u2019s needs, has a warm, welcoming feel. Calum, now 20, wanders in and out. He is lovable, chatty and childlike. His language still resembles that of a four-year-old.</p> <p>In Calum\u2019s early years, his parents thought he was simply a gifted child. He taught himself to read at three and on his first day at primary school he wrote the word \u201cconscientiousness\u201d on the teacher\u2019s desk. At seven, he had a reading age of 14. Yet he was still non-verbal. He was sent to a specialist, <a href=\"http://www.spanglefish.com/hyperlexiauk/hyperlexia-whatishyperlexia.asp\" title=\"\">who diagnosed hyperlexia</a> \u2013 a syndrome characterised by a child\u2019s precocious ability to read, accompanied by profound difficulties in understanding and talking. He was also diagnosed with epilepsy, cerebral palsy and autism.</p> <p>It had all started so promisingly at Kingspark, a special educational needs school in Dundee. The school, which caters for children with complex medical problems and learning difficulties, had just opened. The facilities were impressive \u2013 two swimming pools, specially adapted bikes, a soft-play area, sensory rooms. Most importantly, it had a fully equipped medical centre on site. The medical team could reach anywhere in the building within a minute of a panic button being pressed. Beth and Peter were relieved. Their son would be happy here.</p> <p>And he was. For six weeks. Then they were told that Calum was being placed in the school\u2019s enhanced support area (ESA). \u201cI thought it was a promotion, and we were pleased Calum was doing so well,\u201d says Beth. It was on his first day there that he returned home badly bruised. \u201cHe did have regular seizures, so we thought perhaps he had injured himself and staff had held his arms tightly to prevent further harm,\u201d Peter says. Although Beth was not able to speak to a teacher when she called that afternoon, the Morrisons were convinced there must have been a simple explanation, so they sent Calum back to school the following Monday.</p> <p>From 9am, Beth phoned the school repeatedly to find out what had happened, but she says nobody would talk to her. In the afternoon, she says, a member of staff rang back. Beth asked if the bruises and urine-soaked clothes were the result of a seizure. She says she was told they were the result of Calum having had an outburst. \u201cShe said he had been restrained for \u2018behaviour\u2019 and then \u2018urinated out of protest\u2019. She said they had sat him in a chair with an egg timer in front of him, so he could see he was being punished. We later found out from staff statements that Calum had been strapped into a chair.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If his injuries had occurred at home, Calum\u00a0would have been removed from us. But we\u00a0were told he had to\u00a0return there</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nine years on, Calum\u2019s parents are still shocked. \u201cUrinating in protest?\u201d Peter says. \u201cOur son had not wet himself once since he was out of nappies. And he doesn\u2019t have outbursts at home. Of course he gets upset sometimes, but we can always talk him round.\u201d Not only had Calum never seen an egg timer, but he had no concept of time \u2013 and still has none today. Beth put all this to the school, and she says she can recite the reply verbatim: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs Morrison, we can handle this. It\u2019s going to be hard, but we can manage this. Calum must learn to behave.\u201d</p> <p>The Morrisons\u2019 first thought was to take Calum out of Kingspark immediately. But they were told by the council that it was the only school equipped to deal with Calum\u2019s needs and that a criminal prosecution against the parents could follow any refusal to school him. So they agreed to let him continue there while they sought advice.</p> <p>A day later, on Tuesday 28 September, Calum again returned from school distressed and wearing different clothes, his own soaked in urine and in a bag. He had a long abrasion down his spine and hundreds of tiny, red spots across his body. His parents feared it was meningitis and took him to the local doctors\u2019 surgery. The GP suggested that Calum was suffering petechial haemorrhaging, most likely caused by extreme pressure on his chest while being restrained face down on the floor. She arranged for him to go to hospital for tests the next day, to rule out a blood-clotting problem. By Wednesday morning, all of Calum\u2019s bruises were clearly visible \u2013 Beth counted 63 of them, including 16 on his upper right arm alone. His spine and throat were bruised and there were hand-print marks on his right shoulder and each of his ankles. The doctor who conducted the tests on Calum that day suggested the police should be informed about his injuries.</p> <p>Calum did not return to Kingspark that week. Beth asked what had happened on the Tuesday and says she was told that he had been restrained in the gym by four staff members, for \u201crefusing to follow the same route as the other children\u201d when riding a bike designed for children with disabilities. It later emerged from records of the incident that two members of staff were across his legs, one was over the top of his body while another held his chin off the floor. After being pinned down, he had wet himself. He was then stripped of his clothes and again put in the chair with the egg timer. Although Calum was 11, he weighed four stone (25kg) and was the size of an average seven-year-old.</p> <p>\u201cIf Calum\u2019s injuries had occurred at home, our boy would have been removed from us,\u201d Peter says. \u201cBut we were told that he had to return to the place that had hurt him. And we were repeatedly warned by Dundee council that it was a criminal offence to refuse to send him to school.\u201d</p> <p>What is defined as \u201creasonable force\u201d can be used in British schools to prevent a pupil from committing an offence, causing injury or damage or disrupting good order. Beth says that restraining children such as Calum for breaking rules is nonsense, because they have no concept of what the rules are. Then there is the slippery word \u201creasonable\u201d. Beth believes the force used against Calum was anything but. </p> <p>The Morrisons said they would send him back to school only with a guarantee that he would not be restrained. Three weeks after his first restraint, Calum returned. There were no more bruises or soiled clothing, but he was terrified of the school. Eventually, it was agreed he would attend only for half days, which he did for the next two and a half years.</p> <p>Beth says the final straw came on Wednesday 15 May 2013. Calum was attending Kingspark only in the afternoons, driven there by Beth or Peter. That day, Beth and Calum arrived at 1.20pm. They waited in reception until a teacher arrived to take him. \u201cI saw a small boy, about eight or nine years old, being led along a corridor, with two members of staff holding his upper arms tightly,\u201d Beth says. \u201cThe boy started flapping his hands, like lots of autistic children do. He didn\u2019t seem to be in danger of hurting himself or the others, but then staff appeared to slam his body into the wall and restrain him with a force that horrified me.\u201d</p> <p>Beth reported what she had seen to the police, who investigated and brought no charges. Calum never returned to Kingspark. His parents sent him to Carnoustie high, a mainstream school, where he spent four happy years. \u201cPeter and I watched proudly as he went to his senior school prom and had a fantastic time,\u201d Beth says. \u201cThe staff loved him and he was very well cared for.\u201d</p> <p>From the day Calum left Kingspark, Beth swore she would campaign to abolish the use of restraint for disciplinary purposes against special-needs children, and to ensure it is used as a last resort only to prevent harm to the child or others. She is also fighting to ensure that parents are informed when children are restrained. Six years on, she is still campaigning.</p> <p>Soon after Calum left, other parents got in touch to tell her their children\u2019s stories. Peter says they hadn\u2019t realised the practice was widespread, as there was no \u201cschool-gate culture\u201d at Kingspark; the children were picked up in the morning by a school bus and dropped at home in the afternoon. \u201cThis is how schools like Kingspark get away with it,\u201d he says.</p> <p>In 2017, Beth set up the charity <a href=\"https://pabsscot.wixsite.com/pabss\" title=\"\">Positive &amp; Active Behaviour Support Scotland</a> (PABSS), which has collated 712 stories from families of children with additional needs who have been injured while being restrained. She says that \u201cnot a single one of these children is neurotypical\u201d. Earlier this year, PABSS and the <a href=\"https://www.challengingbehaviour.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Challenging Behaviour Foundation</a>, a UK-wide charity for people with severe learning disabilities, produced a report showing that, of the 566 families of children with learning disabilities and challenging behaviour surveyed, <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2Wz0vU4\" title=\"\">88% said their child had experienced restraint</a>, with 35% saying they had experienced it regularly. Most of these restraints occurred in school settings. Fifty-eight per cent of families questioned said their children had suffered injuries after being restrained, including \u201cunexplained bruises, what looked like carpet burns to knees and ankles, unexplained broken wrist\u201d.</p> <p>The report examined all restrictive interventions with disabled children, including mechanical restraint (such as being strapped into a chair), chemical restraint (medication) and seclusion (being isolated in a room that the child is prevented from leaving), concluding that all were overused. Sixty per cent of those surveyed believed that restrictive interventions were used by schools as their main method of tackling challenging behaviour, rather than as a last resort to prevent injury. Only 17% of the families surveyed said that a restrictive intervention had been recorded.</p> <p>In 2016, Beth won an award for outstanding achievement at the British Institute of Learning Disabilities. Last year, she was inducted on to the Saltire Society\u2019s list of <a href=\"http://www.saltiresociety.org.uk/awards/outstanding-women/outstanding-women-of-scotland-community/2018/beth-morrison/\" title=\"\">outstanding </a><a href=\"http://www.saltiresociety.org.uk/awards/outstanding-women/outstanding-women-of-scotland-community/2018/beth-morrison/\" title=\"\">women of Scotland</a>. But it is little consolation for the guilt she feels over her son\u2019s experience, she says. \u201cCalum tried desperately to communicate how distressed he was and I missed the signs. I will have to live with the fact for the rest of my life.\u201d</p> <p>In 2015, Dr Brodie Paterson, a specialist in handling vulnerable people, published a report claiming that Calum\u2019s injuries were \u201cinconsistent\u201d with the correct restraint techniques, and that he had \u201cpreviously only come across such petechial haemorrhaging in fatalities associated with restraint application\u201d. He claims that Calum was exposed to a potentially fatal level of risk that was \u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d. A police investigation concluded in March 2014 that there had been \u201cno criminal intent\u201d on the part of the staff who restrained Calum.</p> <p>Kingspark declined to comment on specific cases. A spokesperson for Dundee city council said: \u201cThe council has engaged with the Scottish children and young people\u2019s commissioner\u2019s investigation and subsequent report and has many of the recommendations in place. The most recent inspection of Kingspark school and local authority quality-assurance processes have found the school to provide a strong focus on ensuring the wellbeing of children and young people. These specific allegations were made nine years ago and it would not be appropriate to comment on individual issues.\u201d</p> <p>It was a fellow pupil who drew attention, in 2017, to the treatment of Michelle. The pupil \u2013 who, like Michelle, had special needs \u2013 scrawled a note that was passed on to Michelle\u2019s parents. \u201cMichelle has been locked in a room and has been banging on the door very loud all afternoon,\u201d it said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"366f5047038956326c26801b775b885f5da5ed5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/366f5047038956326c26801b775b885f5da5ed5c/0_2129_6208_6032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\"Karen\", who son Adam has ADHD and autism\" width=\"1000\" height=\"972\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karen, whose son, Adam, \u2018looked like he\u2019d gone 10 rounds in a boxing ring\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Polly Braden/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Michelle\u2019s parents, Jane and Andrew, knew she had behaviour issues, but they had no idea that their 15-year-old daughter was regularly locked in a tiny, bare room. (The school has since admitted doing so.) \u201cWe were disgusted when we found out \u2013 sick and angry and sad,\u201d Jane says. Like Beth, she talks of an overwhelming sense of guilt.</p> <p>We meet Jane on a windy day at a hotel in Edinburgh, not far from where the family live in a small town in the Scottish Borders. Michelle cannot be here because she is in hospital having her seizure activity monitored. She has a rare, severe form of epilepsy.</p> <p>Jane had a traumatic pregnancy. When she was 24 weeks pregnant, her brother died suddenly. She later discovered that, in the same week, Michelle suffered a stroke in the womb. Michelle was partly paralysed down the right side of her body. She was later diagnosed with autism and has traits of <a href=\"https://www.autism.org.uk/about/what-is/pda.aspx\" title=\"\">pathological demand avoidance</a> (PDA), meaning that she resists everyday demands and expectations because they cause her huge anxiety.</p> <p>Shortly before her fourth birthday, Michelle started at a local nursery, three mornings a week. When she was asked to do something she didn\u2019t want to do, or couldn\u2019t do, she would lie on the floor shouting. At the age of six, she started primary school and began to exhibit aggressive behaviour \u2013 swearing, spitting and lashing out at staff. She progressed to a mainstream secondary school, which had an annexe for children with special needs. Jane was told that occasionally Michelle would be given \u201ctime out\u201d in a \u201cblue space\u201d, but it seemed nothing to worry about. If anything, it sounded rather idyllic.</p> <p>Then Jane discovered that the space was a small, locked room with bolts on the outside, and that Michelle would hammer on the door to be released. Her parents withdrew Michelle from the school and began to investigate her educational history through freedom of information (FoI) requests. The more they found out, the more horrified they became. Her parents had never been told that she had been restrained at primary school and barred from school trips. One of a series of documents obtained under FoI revealed that Michelle\u2019s teaching assistant had previous been sacked from a care home for abusing residents.</p> <p>Jane discovered from the documents that, at secondary school, Michelle had been secluded on a daily basis as punishment for non-compliance. As Jane points out, Michelle doesn\u2019t know how to comply. Perhaps most shockingly, Michelle\u2019s behaviour support plan, which her parents had never been shown, stated that if members of staff were spat at by Michelle, they should \u201cuse a tissue to wipe the spit off yourself and gently wipe it back on to Michelle\u201d. \u201cThe instruction was written by a teacher without talking to us or Michelle\u2019s doctor or any of the experts,\u201d Jane says. \u201cThe behaviour support plan was purely punitive. It was threatening all the way through, written without any understanding of Michelle\u2019s individual needs.\u201d</p> <p>The school\u2019s internal memo of the afternoon that triggered the alarm, which was obtained through a subject access request by Michelle\u2019s parents, states that Michelle was \u201cguided to the safe room following a small incident\u201d and that she was \u201cin crisis and kicking the door and screaming at staff\u201d. The memo also states: \u201cStaff clear this was not her asking to get out, but demonstrating physical aggression.\u201d It further records: \u201cAs incident happened at end of day, diaries had already been written \u2013 email to parents about incident didn\u2019t happen because it wasn\u2019t a high-scale incident.\u201d</p> <p>Jane says that Michelle\u2019s experience at school left her a wreck. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t do the simple things that she used to do, like go for a walk, because she was so anxious.\u201d Michelle is now thriving at the complex/additional needs unit in her new, mainstream school and her parents feel they have their daughter back. It is more than 20 miles each way, but Jane says it is worth it. Michelle has not been restrained or secluded once.</p> <p>More than once, Jane says that maybe she and Andrew were \u201cthick\u201d not to have realised what was going on; but they had assumed that Michelle would be treated at school with the same respect as their other child, who does not have special needs. \u201cChildren with special needs were not treated as equals in this school,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were dehumanised.\u201d</p> <p>Jane says all her complaints to the council about the school have been upheld, except for one. Her voice rises with disbelief. \u201cThey said seclusion was good practice for Michelle, but we <em>know</em> just how traumatised she was by it.\u201d A spokesperson for Scottish Borders council says: \u201cTo ensure our practice remains in line with national guidance, we have been working to develop a new inclusion policy. This includes clear guidance on seclusion and restraint.\u201d</p> <p>Last December, the Scottish children\u2019s commissioner, Bruce Adamson, published <a href=\"https://www.cypcs.org.uk/ufiles/No-Safe-Place.pdf\" title=\"\">No Safe Place: Restraint </a><a href=\"https://www.cypcs.org.uk/ufiles/No-Safe-Place.pdf\" title=\"\">And Seclusion </a><a href=\"https://www.cypcs.org.uk/ufiles/No-Safe-Place.pdf\" title=\"\">In Scotland\u2019s Schools</a>. His investigation concluded that all such incidents should be recorded and that parents or carers should be told \u201cas soon as reasonably practicable\u201d. It also recommended that the Scottish government should publish a \u201crights-based national policy and guidance\u201d on restraint and seclusion in schools. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I trusted those people to look after my child and look what happened. I will always feel guilty</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, in England and Wales, a review commissioned in 2011 by Michael Gove, then the education secretary, reached a very different conclusion. Gove asked Charlie Taylor, then the government\u2019s adviser on behaviour in schools, to review the recording and reporting of the use of force in schools. <a href=\"http://data.parliament.uk/DepositedPapers/Files/DEP2011-1400/DEP2011-1400.pdf\" title=\"\">Taylor\u2019s report</a> distinguished between mainstream schools, where the use of significant force is \u201cextremely rare\u201d, and special schools, where \u201csome pupils, either due to a special need or because they have severe behaviour difficulties, can require more regular physical intervention\u201d. He also stated that \u201cspecial schools may have a different threshold for what is \u2018significant\u2019 force and they use their judgment to decide which incidents should be reported to parents\u201d.</p> <p>Taylor reported that obliging schools to record significant incidents of force could have a \u201cnegative effect\u201d on the relationship between staff in special schools and parents. He said it would \u201cadd to the bureaucratic burden for some, but not all, schools\u201d.</p> <p>Taylor\u2019s review did not cause an outcry at the time \u2013 perhaps because so few people knew about it. But campaigners today are appalled by its tone and its findings. They point out that it is impossible to know how widespread the restraint and seclusion of children is in schools, precisely because it has never been obligatory for schools to record and report it.</p> <p>The Challenging Behaviour Foundation stresses that the inappropriate use of restraint is not an issue in all special schools. \u201cWe have examples of children who have moved from one special school, where staff said it was impossible to support their child without the use of restrictive interventions, to another where they are never used,\u201d says Vivien Cooper, the charity\u2019s chief executive. \u201cSo this is about leadership, school practice, staff skills and training, not the type of school.\u201d There are alternatives to restraint. For example, Cooper says, if a child suffers from sensory overload, a teacher can move them to a less noisy or brightly lit area; non-verbal children can be taught signs or symbols to indicate that they need a break. \u201cSchools using positive behaviour support report huge reductions in the use of restrictive interventions.\u201d</p> <p>The government finished consulting on <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/restraint-and-restrictive-intervention-draft-guidance\" title=\"\">draft guidelines to reduce the need for restraint for young people with special education needs and disabilities</a> in January 2018. Last week, it finally published that report. It recommended that policies should be in place \u201cfor promoting positive relationships and behaviours and eliminating unnecessary and inappropriate use of restraint\u201d, and that a system should be in place for the recording and reporting of incidents \u201cwhere required\u201d.</p> <p>Campaigners are not impressed. \u201cThe guidance is non-statutory, does not cover mainstream schools \u2013 where we know much restraint and seclusion takes place \u2013 and does not require schools to inform parents if a restrictive intervention has taken place,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cIt defends the use of restrictive practices such as seclusion rooms \u2018as a disciplinary penalty\u2019 and, unlike the equivalent adult guidance, fails to prohibit the use of prone restraint, which is known to pose significant risks. It is hard to square this with a stated commitment to children\u2019s rights.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>Make no mistake, Karen says: her son Adam is hard work. Adam is 14 and has been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism. He is potty-mouthed and has meltdowns galore, but she has never felt threatened by him. \u201cHe\u2019ll hurl abuse at you or throw something, but he\u2019d never actually attack anybody.\u201d This made it all the more shocking when she discovered how many times Adam had been restrained soon after starting secondary school.</p> <p>Like Michelle, Adam also has traits of PDA, as well as a sensory processing disorder that means he can\u2019t stand being touched. It is five years since Karen gave him a proper hug. But, she says, that is just the way things are with Adam; the family has adapted. \u201cSometimes I ask him for a cuddle and he tells me to fuck off. The thing about Adam is that he says all the things we\u2019d like to say but don\u2019t. He\u2019s got a brilliant sense of humour.\u201d</p> <p>Karen and her husband John live in a well-to-do part of Essex. Their home is large, comfortable and messy \u2013 as you might expect of a family with four young boys. The back garden is crammed with rabbit hutches, footballs and bikes. On the wall by the front door is a framed quote \u2013 the family maxim: \u201cIn this house, we do ADHD, we do meltdowns, we do tears and frustration, we worry and we stress, but we also hope for a better day and we persevere and we smile because in this house we don\u2019t go down without a fight.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cc6550a3fc2241af1855991064968c4ad680018d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc6550a3fc2241af1855991064968c4ad680018d/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beth Morrison, founder of Positive and Active Behaviour Support Scotland, with her husband Peter\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beth Morrison has won an outstanding achievement award for her work to protect children with disabilities.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Adam went to a mainstream primary school where he did OK. But after eight unhappy months at secondary school, Karen home-schooled him for a short period while a special school was found. He was eventually placed at a school in the county for children with social, emotional or mental health problems. Eighteen months on, he is still struggling after his brief experience there.</p> <p>By the time he left, he had been excluded 14 times and restrained on 30 separate occasions, in the space of 12 weeks. Often he had been restrained several times in one incident. \u201cIt all looked really good at the start, but I wouldn\u2019t put my dog in that school,\u201d Karen says. \u201cOne day, Adam came home and hid in the garage. He looked like he\u2019d gone 10 rounds in a boxing ring. He was covered in bruises and was completely traumatised. The longer this went on, the more restraints were being used. They told us about things he\u2019d done and I was thinking: \u2018Is it actually my child doing this?\u2019 Because we\u2019d never heard of such behaviours.\u201d</p> <p>Did she know about the restraint system before Adam started there? \u201cI was asked to sign a form allowing them to restrain him. I refused, but they said he would be restrained anyway if necessary. But I never thought Adam would have to be. He used to go to <a href=\"https://armycadets.com/\" title=\"\">army </a><a href=\"https://armycadets.com/\" title=\"\">cadets</a>, he played for a football team. We go to our caravan at the coast every weekend and he is never aggressive to any other children; he\u2019s got loads of friends down there.\u201d</p> <p>Things came to a head in March 2018 when Karen received a call at 3.15pm telling her to go to school as there was a crisis. On her way there, she was passed by two police cars with their sirens blaring. After Adam had been restrained nine times that day, he had spat, kicked and thrown gravel at staff. The school called the police. When Karen arrived, Adam was standing on the playing field, hyperventilating and screaming. She tried to calm him down, but was told by police that she would be charged with obstruction if she didn\u2019t get out of the way. Adam was then pinned down, handcuffed and put in a spit hood. \u201cThey took him to the station and me and my mum had to go and sit in custody with him till 1am,\u201d says Karen. At the age of 12, Adam was convicted of criminal damage and six counts of actual bodily harm on staff, and given a reparation order \u2013 a non-custodial sentence supervised by a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/youth-offending-team\" title=\"\">youth offending team</a>.</p> <p>He never went back to the school and has struggled since. He was recently excluded from another special school after being restrained. Karen fears that the 2018 incident has damaged Adam irreparably, as well as the family. \u201cI trusted those people to look after my child and look what happened. I will always feel guilty for that.\u201d</p> <p>She sifts through the incident reports she obtained after making an FoI request, reading bits aloud. (Until today, her father had kept them because she could not face reading them.) Initially, her voice is calm and confident, but it soon begins to quiver. The details are shocking. In one incident, Adam was restrained for refusing to leave the school hall. \u201cThey are only supposed to restrain as a last resort. How can they say this is the last resort?\u201d Karen says. Another report states that Adam said he could not breathe while being restrained. Karen is convinced that some of the staff simply didn\u2019t know what they were doing. \u201cThey\u2019ve done a short course on restraint and think they know it all. And they\u2019re just damaging children.\u201d</p> <p>The incident that resulted in Adam being charged lasted five hours and involved multiple restraints. Karen can barely believe what she is reading. \u201cThree hundred minutes! All day that\u2019s going on and then my son got arrested and charged at 12 years old.\u201d She reads on: \u201c\u2018Adam becomes increasingly aggressive when a hold is implemented.\u2019 Of course he does. He\u2019s got a sensory processing disorder and touch is his main trigger. I don\u2019t have to touch Adam, so why do they?\u201d</p> <p>Finally, she reads a document that shocks her into tears \u2013 a restraint she knew nothing about. She takes a moment to compose herself. \u201cThis is horrendous. \u2018Adam found some rope. He climbed up a tree with it\u2026 [name redacted] asked Adam to give her the rope and come down from the tree. He said he was going to hang himself and put the rope around his neck.\u201d She stops, wipes her tears and struggles to get her words out. \u201c\u2018We asked him to remove the rope and give it to us. Adam then took the rope off and threw it over the fence.\u2019\u201d When Adam finally came down the tree, he was restrained again.</p> <p>Karen throws down the document. \u201cWhat is happening to a 12-year-old child that he is in a tree with a rope around his neck? This is pretty bad, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She exhales deeply, trying to catch her breath. \u201cIf we behaved like this to our kids, we wouldn\u2019t have custody of them.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/07/teachers-excluded-pupils-schools-exclusions\">Something is going very wrong for vulnerable kids \u2013 but is the school to blame? | Gaby Hinsliff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A spokesperson for Essex county council said of the school: \u201cOur last visit was in October 2018, and at that time all staff training was viewed to be up to date and in line with the behaviour policy. However, the safety and wellbeing of pupils in all Essex schools is paramount and when concerns are raised we will of course investigate when necessary.\u201d The latest Ofsted report on the school, in January 2019, rated it as \u201cgood\u201d and stated that procedures for the use of restraint were followed appropriately. The school added: \u201cParents/carers are informed every single time a child is restrained. Restrictive physical interventions are only used as a last resort, in order to keep the child and the people around them safe. All staff are fully trained in the use of management of actual or potential aggression techniques.\u201d</p> <p>Karen says the experience has taken a toll. \u201cIt\u2019s smashed our marriage. This situation has been so fraught that I\u2019m always on edge.\u201d</p> <p>When Adam started at the special school, he was meeting his academic targets and had not been in trouble with the police. Now, aged 14, he regularly goes missing, has a criminal record and still has the academic age of an 11-year-old. But Karen knows that, compared with some, he is lucky. \u201cI\u2019m a mum who\u2019s quite intelligent and can say: \u2018I\u2019m not putting up with this\u2019, but some parents have their own issues; they haven\u2019t got the ability to stand up to these people. Who\u2019s going to fight for those children?\u201d</p> <p>Back on the Dundee coast, Beth Morrison is preparing for the next stage of her battle. She has helped raised the funds to judicially review the secretary of state for education \u201cin relation to the absence of a lawful statutory framework regulating the use of restraint of children\u201d in Welsh and English schools. (She decided not to judicially review Scotland because she is confident it is on the brink of change.) All three claimants are children with disabilities who have experienced significant use of restraint at special schools in Wales, North Yorkshire and Essex. Beth argues that the current legislation discriminates against children with disabilities and is in contravention of the European convention on human rights.</p> <p>It is nine years since her son returned from school traumatised, but she will not stop until she has got justice for him and other children like him. \u201cCalum is no longer in education, but I will not walk away. I cannot sit here knowing that these cruel things are happening to our most vulnerable children, in the very place they should be kept safe.\u201d</p> <p><em>Some names have been changed.</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 10 July 2019.

      "bodyText": "Beth and Peter Morrison remember every detail about the day their son Calum returned, broken, from Kingspark school. It was Friday 24 September 2010. The school bus dropped him home at 3.25pm. His face was ashen, his lips blue. He was wearing different clothes from those he had left in that morning \u2013 a thin T-shirt, shorts and plimsolls, no underwear and no coat. His own clothes were soaked in urine and stuffed in a plastic bag. \u201cI asked him what was wrong. He said: \u2018I dizzy, Mummy, teacher hurt,\u2019\u201d Beth says. Although Calum was 11 at the time, he still spoke like a toddler. Beth called the school immediately to find out what had happened. Beth says she was kept holding for more than 15 minutes before being told staff were in a meeting. That evening, Calum was clingy and tearful. \u201cAs I was tucking him in for the night, he said: \u2018No school, Mummy, school bad.\u2019\u201d The next morning, when Beth was taking off his pyjamas, she noticed the bruises on his upper arms. She asked Calum about them. \u201cTeacher hurt arm. Wet on the floor,\u201d he said. She looked in the home-school diary \u2013 a logbook used by the school and Calum\u2019s parents to relay noteworthy incidents \u2013 for clues as to what had happened. Nothing was recorded. We are sitting in the kitchen of the Morrisons\u2019 bungalow in a small coastal town near Dundee. Their home, which has been adapted to Calum\u2019s needs, has a warm, welcoming feel. Calum, now 20, wanders in and out. He is lovable, chatty and childlike. His language still resembles that of a four-year-old. In Calum\u2019s early years, his parents thought he was simply a gifted child. He taught himself to read at three and on his first day at primary school he wrote the word \u201cconscientiousness\u201d on the teacher\u2019s desk. At seven, he had a reading age of 14. Yet he was still non-verbal. He was sent to a specialist, who diagnosed hyperlexia \u2013 a syndrome characterised by a child\u2019s precocious ability to read, accompanied by profound difficulties in understanding and talking. He was also diagnosed with epilepsy, cerebral palsy and autism. It had all started so promisingly at Kingspark, a special educational needs school in Dundee. The school, which caters for children with complex medical problems and learning difficulties, had just opened. The facilities were impressive \u2013 two swimming pools, specially adapted bikes, a soft-play area, sensory rooms. Most importantly, it had a fully equipped medical centre on site. The medical team could reach anywhere in the building within a minute of a panic button being pressed. Beth and Peter were relieved. Their son would be happy here. And he was. For six weeks. Then they were told that Calum was being placed in the school\u2019s enhanced support area (ESA). \u201cI thought it was a promotion, and we were pleased Calum was doing so well,\u201d says Beth. It was on his first day there that he returned home badly bruised. \u201cHe did have regular seizures, so we thought perhaps he had injured himself and staff had held his arms tightly to prevent further harm,\u201d Peter says. Although Beth was not able to speak to a teacher when she called that afternoon, the Morrisons were convinced there must have been a simple explanation, so they sent Calum back to school the following Monday. From 9am, Beth phoned the school repeatedly to find out what had happened, but she says nobody would talk to her. In the afternoon, she says, a member of staff rang back. Beth asked if the bruises and urine-soaked clothes were the result of a seizure. She says she was told they were the result of Calum having had an outburst. \u201cShe said he had been restrained for \u2018behaviour\u2019 and then \u2018urinated out of protest\u2019. She said they had sat him in a chair with an egg timer in front of him, so he could see he was being punished. We later found out from staff statements that Calum had been strapped into a chair.\u201d Nine years on, Calum\u2019s parents are still shocked. \u201cUrinating in protest?\u201d Peter says. \u201cOur son had not wet himself once since he was out of nappies. And he doesn\u2019t have outbursts at home. Of course he gets upset sometimes, but we can always talk him round.\u201d Not only had Calum never seen an egg timer, but he had no concept of time \u2013 and still has none today. Beth put all this to the school, and she says she can recite the reply verbatim: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mrs Morrison, we can handle this. It\u2019s going to be hard, but we can manage this. Calum must learn to behave.\u201d The Morrisons\u2019 first thought was to take Calum out of Kingspark immediately. But they were told by the council that it was the only school equipped to deal with Calum\u2019s needs and that a criminal prosecution against the parents could follow any refusal to school him. So they agreed to let him continue there while they sought advice. A day later, on Tuesday 28 September, Calum again returned from school distressed and wearing different clothes, his own soaked in urine and in a bag. He had a long abrasion down his spine and hundreds of tiny, red spots across his body. His parents feared it was meningitis and took him to the local doctors\u2019 surgery. The GP suggested that Calum was suffering petechial haemorrhaging, most likely caused by extreme pressure on his chest while being restrained face down on the floor. She arranged for him to go to hospital for tests the next day, to rule out a blood-clotting problem. By Wednesday morning, all of Calum\u2019s bruises were clearly visible \u2013 Beth counted 63 of them, including 16 on his upper right arm alone. His spine and throat were bruised and there were hand-print marks on his right shoulder and each of his ankles. The doctor who conducted the tests on Calum that day suggested the police should be informed about his injuries. Calum did not return to Kingspark that week. Beth asked what had happened on the Tuesday and says she was told that he had been restrained in the gym by four staff members, for \u201crefusing to follow the same route as the other children\u201d when riding a bike designed for children with disabilities. It later emerged from records of the incident that two members of staff were across his legs, one was over the top of his body while another held his chin off the floor. After being pinned down, he had wet himself. He was then stripped of his clothes and again put in the chair with the egg timer. Although Calum was 11, he weighed four stone (25kg) and was the size of an average seven-year-old. \u201cIf Calum\u2019s injuries had occurred at home, our boy would have been removed from us,\u201d Peter says. \u201cBut we were told that he had to return to the place that had hurt him. And we were repeatedly warned by Dundee council that it was a criminal offence to refuse to send him to school.\u201d What is defined as \u201creasonable force\u201d can be used in British schools to prevent a pupil from committing an offence, causing injury or damage or disrupting good order. Beth says that restraining children such as Calum for breaking rules is nonsense, because they have no concept of what the rules are. Then there is the slippery word \u201creasonable\u201d. Beth believes the force used against Calum was anything but. The Morrisons said they would send him back to school only with a guarantee that he would not be restrained. Three weeks after his first restraint, Calum returned. There were no more bruises or soiled clothing, but he was terrified of the school. Eventually, it was agreed he would attend only for half days, which he did for the next two and a half years. Beth says the final straw came on Wednesday 15 May 2013. Calum was attending Kingspark only in the afternoons, driven there by Beth or Peter. That day, Beth and Calum arrived at 1.20pm. They waited in reception until a teacher arrived to take him. \u201cI saw a small boy, about eight or nine years old, being led along a corridor, with two members of staff holding his upper arms tightly,\u201d Beth says. \u201cThe boy started flapping his hands, like lots of autistic children do. He didn\u2019t seem to be in danger of hurting himself or the others, but then staff appeared to slam his body into the wall and restrain him with a force that horrified me.\u201d Beth reported what she had seen to the police, who investigated and brought no charges. Calum never returned to Kingspark. His parents sent him to Carnoustie high, a mainstream school, where he spent four happy years. \u201cPeter and I watched proudly as he went to his senior school prom and had a fantastic time,\u201d Beth says. \u201cThe staff loved him and he was very well cared for.\u201d From the day Calum left Kingspark, Beth swore she would campaign to abolish the use of restraint for disciplinary purposes against special-needs children, and to ensure it is used as a last resort only to prevent harm to the child or others. She is also fighting to ensure that parents are informed when children are restrained. Six years on, she is still campaigning. Soon after Calum left, other parents got in touch to tell her their children\u2019s stories. Peter says they hadn\u2019t realised the practice was widespread, as there was no \u201cschool-gate culture\u201d at Kingspark; the children were picked up in the morning by a school bus and dropped at home in the afternoon. \u201cThis is how schools like Kingspark get away with it,\u201d he says. In 2017, Beth set up the charity Positive &amp; Active Behaviour Support Scotland (PABSS), which has collated 712 stories from families of children with additional needs who have been injured while being restrained. She says that \u201cnot a single one of these children is neurotypical\u201d. Earlier this year, PABSS and the Challenging Behaviour Foundation, a UK-wide charity for people with severe learning disabilities, produced a report showing that, of the 566 families of children with learning disabilities and challenging behaviour surveyed, 88% said their child had experienced restraint, with 35% saying they had experienced it regularly. Most of these restraints occurred in school settings. Fifty-eight per cent of families questioned said their children had suffered injuries after being restrained, including \u201cunexplained bruises, what looked like carpet burns to knees and ankles, unexplained broken wrist\u201d. The report examined all restrictive interventions with disabled children, including mechanical restraint (such as being strapped into a chair), chemical restraint (medication) and seclusion (being isolated in a room that the child is prevented from leaving), concluding that all were overused. Sixty per cent of those surveyed believed that restrictive interventions were used by schools as their main method of tackling challenging behaviour, rather than as a last resort to prevent injury. Only 17% of the families surveyed said that a restrictive intervention had been recorded. In 2016, Beth won an award for outstanding achievement at the British Institute of Learning Disabilities. Last year, she was inducted on to the Saltire Society\u2019s list of outstanding women of Scotland. But it is little consolation for the guilt she feels over her son\u2019s experience, she says. \u201cCalum tried desperately to communicate how distressed he was and I missed the signs. I will have to live with the fact for the rest of my life.\u201d In 2015, Dr Brodie Paterson, a specialist in handling vulnerable people, published a report claiming that Calum\u2019s injuries were \u201cinconsistent\u201d with the correct restraint techniques, and that he had \u201cpreviously only come across such petechial haemorrhaging in fatalities associated with restraint application\u201d. He claims that Calum was exposed to a potentially fatal level of risk that was \u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d. A police investigation concluded in March 2014 that there had been \u201cno criminal intent\u201d on the part of the staff who restrained Calum. Kingspark declined to comment on specific cases. A spokesperson for Dundee city council said: \u201cThe council has engaged with the Scottish children and young people\u2019s commissioner\u2019s investigation and subsequent report and has many of the recommendations in place. The most recent inspection of Kingspark school and local authority quality-assurance processes have found the school to provide a strong focus on ensuring the wellbeing of children and young people. These specific allegations were made nine years ago and it would not be appropriate to comment on individual issues.\u201d It was a fellow pupil who drew attention, in 2017, to the treatment of Michelle. The pupil \u2013 who, like Michelle, had special needs \u2013 scrawled a note that was passed on to Michelle\u2019s parents. \u201cMichelle has been locked in a room and has been banging on the door very loud all afternoon,\u201d it said. Michelle\u2019s parents, Jane and Andrew, knew she had behaviour issues, but they had no idea that their 15-year-old daughter was regularly locked in a tiny, bare room. (The school has since admitted doing so.) \u201cWe were disgusted when we found out \u2013 sick and angry and sad,\u201d Jane says. Like Beth, she talks of an overwhelming sense of guilt. We meet Jane on a windy day at a hotel in Edinburgh, not far from where the family live in a small town in the Scottish Borders. Michelle cannot be here because she is in hospital having her seizure activity monitored. She has a rare, severe form of epilepsy. Jane had a traumatic pregnancy. When she was 24 weeks pregnant, her brother died suddenly. She later discovered that, in the same week, Michelle suffered a stroke in the womb. Michelle was partly paralysed down the right side of her body. She was later diagnosed with autism and has traits of pathological demand avoidance (PDA), meaning that she resists everyday demands and expectations because they cause her huge anxiety. Shortly before her fourth birthday, Michelle started at a local nursery, three mornings a week. When she was asked to do something she didn\u2019t want to do, or couldn\u2019t do, she would lie on the floor shouting. At the age of six, she started primary school and began to exhibit aggressive behaviour \u2013 swearing, spitting and lashing out at staff. She progressed to a mainstream secondary school, which had an annexe for children with special needs. Jane was told that occasionally Michelle would be given \u201ctime out\u201d in a \u201cblue space\u201d, but it seemed nothing to worry about. If anything, it sounded rather idyllic. Then Jane discovered that the space was a small, locked room with bolts on the outside, and that Michelle would hammer on the door to be released. Her parents withdrew Michelle from the school and began to investigate her educational history through freedom of information (FoI) requests. The more they found out, the more horrified they became. Her parents had never been told that she had been restrained at primary school and barred from school trips. One of a series of documents obtained under FoI revealed that Michelle\u2019s teaching assistant had previous been sacked from a care home for abusing residents. Jane discovered from the documents that, at secondary school, Michelle had been secluded on a daily basis as punishment for non-compliance. As Jane points out, Michelle doesn\u2019t know how to comply. Perhaps most shockingly, Michelle\u2019s behaviour support plan, which her parents had never been shown, stated that if members of staff were spat at by Michelle, they should \u201cuse a tissue to wipe the spit off yourself and gently wipe it back on to Michelle\u201d. \u201cThe instruction was written by a teacher without talking to us or Michelle\u2019s doctor or any of the experts,\u201d Jane says. \u201cThe behaviour support plan was purely punitive. It was threatening all the way through, written without any understanding of Michelle\u2019s individual needs.\u201d The school\u2019s internal memo of the afternoon that triggered the alarm, which was obtained through a subject access request by Michelle\u2019s parents, states that Michelle was \u201cguided to the safe room following a small incident\u201d and that she was \u201cin crisis and kicking the door and screaming at staff\u201d. The memo also states: \u201cStaff clear this was not her asking to get out, but demonstrating physical aggression.\u201d It further records: \u201cAs incident happened at end of day, diaries had already been written \u2013 email to parents about incident didn\u2019t happen because it wasn\u2019t a high-scale incident.\u201d Jane says that Michelle\u2019s experience at school left her a wreck. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t do the simple things that she used to do, like go for a walk, because she was so anxious.\u201d Michelle is now thriving at the complex/additional needs unit in her new, mainstream school and her parents feel they have their daughter back. It is more than 20 miles each way, but Jane says it is worth it. Michelle has not been restrained or secluded once. More than once, Jane says that maybe she and Andrew were \u201cthick\u201d not to have realised what was going on; but they had assumed that Michelle would be treated at school with the same respect as their other child, who does not have special needs. \u201cChildren with special needs were not treated as equals in this school,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were dehumanised.\u201d Jane says all her complaints to the council about the school have been upheld, except for one. Her voice rises with disbelief. \u201cThey said seclusion was good practice for Michelle, but we know just how traumatised she was by it.\u201d A spokesperson for Scottish Borders council says: \u201cTo ensure our practice remains in line with national guidance, we have been working to develop a new inclusion policy. This includes clear guidance on seclusion and restraint.\u201d Last December, the Scottish children\u2019s commissioner, Bruce Adamson, published No Safe Place: Restraint And Seclusion In Scotland\u2019s Schools. His investigation concluded that all such incidents should be recorded and that parents or carers should be told \u201cas soon as reasonably practicable\u201d. It also recommended that the Scottish government should publish a \u201crights-based national policy and guidance\u201d on restraint and seclusion in schools. Meanwhile, in England and Wales, a review commissioned in 2011 by Michael Gove, then the education secretary, reached a very different conclusion. Gove asked Charlie Taylor, then the government\u2019s adviser on behaviour in schools, to review the recording and reporting of the use of force in schools. Taylor\u2019s report distinguished between mainstream schools, where the use of significant force is \u201cextremely rare\u201d, and special schools, where \u201csome pupils, either due to a special need or because they have severe behaviour difficulties, can require more regular physical intervention\u201d. He also stated that \u201cspecial schools may have a different threshold for what is \u2018significant\u2019 force and they use their judgment to decide which incidents should be reported to parents\u201d. Taylor reported that obliging schools to record significant incidents of force could have a \u201cnegative effect\u201d on the relationship between staff in special schools and parents. He said it would \u201cadd to the bureaucratic burden for some, but not all, schools\u201d. Taylor\u2019s review did not cause an outcry at the time \u2013 perhaps because so few people knew about it. But campaigners today are appalled by its tone and its findings. They point out that it is impossible to know how widespread the restraint and seclusion of children is in schools, precisely because it has never been obligatory for schools to record and report it. The Challenging Behaviour Foundation stresses that the inappropriate use of restraint is not an issue in all special schools. \u201cWe have examples of children who have moved from one special school, where staff said it was impossible to support their child without the use of restrictive interventions, to another where they are never used,\u201d says Vivien Cooper, the charity\u2019s chief executive. \u201cSo this is about leadership, school practice, staff skills and training, not the type of school.\u201d There are alternatives to restraint. For example, Cooper says, if a child suffers from sensory overload, a teacher can move them to a less noisy or brightly lit area; non-verbal children can be taught signs or symbols to indicate that they need a break. \u201cSchools using positive behaviour support report huge reductions in the use of restrictive interventions.\u201d The government finished consulting on draft guidelines to reduce the need for restraint for young people with special education needs and disabilities in January 2018. Last week, it finally published that report. It recommended that policies should be in place \u201cfor promoting positive relationships and behaviours and eliminating unnecessary and inappropriate use of restraint\u201d, and that a system should be in place for the recording and reporting of incidents \u201cwhere required\u201d. Campaigners are not impressed. \u201cThe guidance is non-statutory, does not cover mainstream schools \u2013 where we know much restraint and seclusion takes place \u2013 and does not require schools to inform parents if a restrictive intervention has taken place,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cIt defends the use of restrictive practices such as seclusion rooms \u2018as a disciplinary penalty\u2019 and, unlike the equivalent adult guidance, fails to prohibit the use of prone restraint, which is known to pose significant risks. It is hard to square this with a stated commitment to children\u2019s rights.\u201d *** Make no mistake, Karen says: her son Adam is hard work. Adam is 14 and has been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism. He is potty-mouthed and has meltdowns galore, but she has never felt threatened by him. \u201cHe\u2019ll hurl abuse at you or throw something, but he\u2019d never actually attack anybody.\u201d This made it all the more shocking when she discovered how many times Adam had been restrained soon after starting secondary school. Like Michelle, Adam also has traits of PDA, as well as a sensory processing disorder that means he can\u2019t stand being touched. It is five years since Karen gave him a proper hug. But, she says, that is just the way things are with Adam; the family has adapted. \u201cSometimes I ask him for a cuddle and he tells me to fuck off. The thing about Adam is that he says all the things we\u2019d like to say but don\u2019t. He\u2019s got a brilliant sense of humour.\u201d Karen and her husband John live in a well-to-do part of Essex. Their home is large, comfortable and messy \u2013 as you might expect of a family with four young boys. The back garden is crammed with rabbit hutches, footballs and bikes. On the wall by the front door is a framed quote \u2013 the family maxim: \u201cIn this house, we do ADHD, we do meltdowns, we do tears and frustration, we worry and we stress, but we also hope for a better day and we persevere and we smile because in this house we don\u2019t go down without a fight.\u201d Adam went to a mainstream primary school where he did OK. But after eight unhappy months at secondary school, Karen home-schooled him for a short period while a special school was found. He was eventually placed at a school in the county for children with social, emotional or mental health problems. Eighteen months on, he is still struggling after his brief experience there. By the time he left, he had been excluded 14 times and restrained on 30 separate occasions, in the space of 12 weeks. Often he had been restrained several times in one incident. \u201cIt all looked really good at the start, but I wouldn\u2019t put my dog in that school,\u201d Karen says. \u201cOne day, Adam came home and hid in the garage. He looked like he\u2019d gone 10 rounds in a boxing ring. He was covered in bruises and was completely traumatised. The longer this went on, the more restraints were being used. They told us about things he\u2019d done and I was thinking: \u2018Is it actually my child doing this?\u2019 Because we\u2019d never heard of such behaviours.\u201d Did she know about the restraint system before Adam started there? \u201cI was asked to sign a form allowing them to restrain him. I refused, but they said he would be restrained anyway if necessary. But I never thought Adam would have to be. He used to go to army cadets, he played for a football team. We go to our caravan at the coast every weekend and he is never aggressive to any other children; he\u2019s got loads of friends down there.\u201d Things came to a head in March 2018 when Karen received a call at 3.15pm telling her to go to school as there was a crisis. On her way there, she was passed by two police cars with their sirens blaring. After Adam had been restrained nine times that day, he had spat, kicked and thrown gravel at staff. The school called the police. When Karen arrived, Adam was standing on the playing field, hyperventilating and screaming. She tried to calm him down, but was told by police that she would be charged with obstruction if she didn\u2019t get out of the way. Adam was then pinned down, handcuffed and put in a spit hood. \u201cThey took him to the station and me and my mum had to go and sit in custody with him till 1am,\u201d says Karen. At the age of 12, Adam was convicted of criminal damage and six counts of actual bodily harm on staff, and given a reparation order \u2013 a non-custodial sentence supervised by a youth offending team. He never went back to the school and has struggled since. He was recently excluded from another special school after being restrained. Karen fears that the 2018 incident has damaged Adam irreparably, as well as the family. \u201cI trusted those people to look after my child and look what happened. I will always feel guilty for that.\u201d She sifts through the incident reports she obtained after making an FoI request, reading bits aloud. (Until today, her father had kept them because she could not face reading them.) Initially, her voice is calm and confident, but it soon begins to quiver. The details are shocking. In one incident, Adam was restrained for refusing to leave the school hall. \u201cThey are only supposed to restrain as a last resort. How can they say this is the last resort?\u201d Karen says. Another report states that Adam said he could not breathe while being restrained. Karen is convinced that some of the staff simply didn\u2019t know what they were doing. \u201cThey\u2019ve done a short course on restraint and think they know it all. And they\u2019re just damaging children.\u201d The incident that resulted in Adam being charged lasted five hours and involved multiple restraints. Karen can barely believe what she is reading. \u201cThree hundred minutes! All day that\u2019s going on and then my son got arrested and charged at 12 years old.\u201d She reads on: \u201c\u2018Adam becomes increasingly aggressive when a hold is implemented.\u2019 Of course he does. He\u2019s got a sensory processing disorder and touch is his main trigger. I don\u2019t have to touch Adam, so why do they?\u201d Finally, she reads a document that shocks her into tears \u2013 a restraint she knew nothing about. She takes a moment to compose herself. \u201cThis is horrendous. \u2018Adam found some rope. He climbed up a tree with it\u2026 [name redacted] asked Adam to give her the rope and come down from the tree. He said he was going to hang himself and put the rope around his neck.\u201d She stops, wipes her tears and struggles to get her words out. \u201c\u2018We asked him to remove the rope and give it to us. Adam then took the rope off and threw it over the fence.\u2019\u201d When Adam finally came down the tree, he was restrained again. Karen throws down the document. \u201cWhat is happening to a 12-year-old child that he is in a tree with a rope around his neck? This is pretty bad, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She exhales deeply, trying to catch her breath. \u201cIf we behaved like this to our kids, we wouldn\u2019t have custody of them.\u201d A spokesperson for Essex county council said of the school: \u201cOur last visit was in October 2018, and at that time all staff training was viewed to be up to date and in line with the behaviour policy. However, the safety and wellbeing of pupils in all Essex schools is paramount and when concerns are raised we will of course investigate when necessary.\u201d The latest Ofsted report on the school, in January 2019, rated it as \u201cgood\u201d and stated that procedures for the use of restraint were followed appropriately. The school added: \u201cParents/carers are informed every single time a child is restrained. Restrictive physical interventions are only used as a last resort, in order to keep the child and the people around them safe. All staff are fully trained in the use of management of actual or potential aggression techniques.\u201d Karen says the experience has taken a toll. \u201cIt\u2019s smashed our marriage. This situation has been so fraught that I\u2019m always on edge.\u201d When Adam started at the special school, he was meeting his academic targets and had not been in trouble with the police. Now, aged 14, he regularly goes missing, has a criminal record and still has the academic age of an 11-year-old. But Karen knows that, compared with some, he is lucky. \u201cI\u2019m a mum who\u2019s quite intelligent and can say: \u2018I\u2019m not putting up with this\u2019, but some parents have their own issues; they haven\u2019t got the ability to stand up to these people. Who\u2019s going to fight for those children?\u201d Back on the Dundee coast, Beth Morrison is preparing for the next stage of her battle. She has helped raised the funds to judicially review the secretary of state for education \u201cin relation to the absence of a lawful statutory framework regulating the use of restraint of children\u201d in Welsh and English schools. (She decided not to judicially review Scotland because she is confident it is on the brink of change.) All three claimants are children with disabilities who have experienced significant use of restraint at special schools in Wales, North Yorkshire and Essex. Beth argues that the current legislation discriminates against children with disabilities and is in contravention of the European convention on human rights. It is nine years since her son returned from school traumatised, but she will not stop until she has got justice for him and other children like him. \u201cCalum is no longer in education, but I will not walk away. I cannot sit here knowing that these cruel things are happening to our most vulnerable children, in the very place they should be kept safe.\u201d Some names have been changed. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 July 2019. An earlier version said that \u2018the Scottish government is still considering its full response\u201d to the Scottish children\u2019s commissioner\u2019s report. In fact the Scottish government had responded last month. \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

      "body": "<p>With the neat timing of one his books, David Nicholls\u2019s new novel <em>Sweet Sorrow</em> is published exactly 10 years after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jul/04/one-day-david-nicholls-review\" title=\"\"><em>One Day</em></a>, the blockbuster romantic comedy that made his name and the rest of us weep. For a long time, the orange book jacket was the brightest thing on the morning commute and an obligatory stripe on the bookshelves of anyone under 40. Set on St Swithin\u2019s day over the course of 20 years, it was a genuine word-of-mouth success; a film starring Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess as will-they-won\u2019t-they friends Emma and Dexter came out in 2011. Since then Nicholls has written two big-screen adaptations (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/nov/16/adapting-great-expectations-david-nicholls\" title=\"\"><em>Great Expectations</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/03/far-from-the-madding-crowd-review-solid-needs-more-mud\" title=\"\"><em>Far from the Madding Crowd</em></a>), and his fourth novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/01/us-david-nicholls-review-fiction\" title=\"\"><em>Us</em></a><em>,</em> which was longlisted for the Booker prize in 2014. In May he was awarded a Bafta for his TV screenplay of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/may/13/patrick-melrose-review-brilliant-portrayal-addiction-benedict-cumberbatch\" title=\"\"><em>Patrick Melrose</em></a>, which starred Benedict Cumberbatch. He\u2019s currently getting up at six in the morning to deliver scripts for the TV dramatisation of <em>Us</em>, which begins filming later this year. Not that he\u2019s complaining \u2013 \u201cI am so lucky,\u201d he marvels several times during our conversation.</p> <p>Despite all the accolades, not to mention dizzying sales figures, he is as self-deprecating as in his earliest interviews. Now 52, he seems as genuine and gently witty as you\u2019d expect from his fiction.

His debut novel, <em>Starter for 10</em>, about a working-class boy obsessed with getting on to <em>University Challenge</em>, was loaded with 80s nostalgia.

While <em>Starter for 10</em> was strongly autobiographical, with <em>Sweet Sorrow </em>he wanted to create some distance from his own past, to avoid writing \u201cthe novel version of your own photo album\u201d. It looks back to the summer of 1997, bookended by the election of New Labour and the death of Princess Diana; but unlike <em>One Day</em>, which, as he says, is \u201clike flicking through old newspapers\u201d, you have to be paying close attention to catch references to these landmark events. \u201cIt felt like one of those big years that come round two or three times a decade, a year in which lots of things are changing, in which the culture seems to have a particular resonance.\u201d This is the era of Britpop: Blur and Oasis are there, the Spice Girls at the school disco (\u201ca kind of musical water-cannon\u201d to get the boys off the dance floor).

Sally Rooney has been called \u201cthe Salinger of the Snapchat generation\u201d, but Nicholls is happy, for the moment, to leave digital speak and social media to the natives. \u201c\u2018Tweet\u2019 feels like quite a clumsy, ugly word that draws attention to itself,\u201d he says, although he knows he is going to have to \u201cgrapple with all that\u201d at some point. One thing that hasn\u2019t changed is the awkwardness of growing up a sensitive, clever boy in a small suburban town, the strict codes, aggression and rivalry of male friendships, so touchingly portrayed in both novels. \u201cTo not be a dick\u201d, as Charlie puts it, \u201cthat was the great rite of passage.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55d19746fd9e8f90b73d4edfae187ba630acabde\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55d19746fd9e8f90b73d4edfae187ba630acabde/0_0_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Loaded with nostalgia \u2026 Starter for 10\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Loaded with nostalgia \u2026 <em>Starter for 10</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Icon Film</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt feels like my most personal book, without being autobiographical,\u201d Nicholls says. \u201cIt\u2019s the one I feel the most emotionally attached to.\u201d He grew up in Eastleigh, Hampshire, which is not unlike the unnamed commuter town in the novel. His father was a maintenance engineer at the Mr Kipling cake factory and his mother worked for the council. Despite the acuteness with which Nicholls writes about divorce, his parents were happily married. \u201cI think so,\u201d he replies cautiously. \u201cIt was stable.\u201d Father-son relationships (all fairly disastrous) have been a preoccupation in his work \u2013 from his 2007 adaptation of Blake Morrison\u2019s memoir <em>And When Did You Last See Your Father?</em> to <em>Great Expectations</em> and <em>Patrick Melrose</em>. He is quick to stress that his own father was nothing like the troubled dads in either <em>Us</em> or <em>Sweet Sorrow</em>,<strong> </strong>but \u201cthe difficulties of the bond, fraught with communication pitfalls, is something that I\u2019ve come back to,\u201d he reflects. \u201cIt\u2019s something I think about a lot with my own son, and my memories of my father.\u201d</p> <p>A middle child, he has described his upbringing as \u201ca sort of Narnia and <em>Coronation Street</em>\u201d, in which he would be reading while the rest of his family watched TV. Unlike Charlie, he was \u201ca real swot. I poured everything into schoolwork.\u201d He was also \u201ca comedy nerd\u201d, given to quoting <em>Monty Python</em> and<em> The</em> <em>Hitch</em><em>hiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy</em>: \u201cI was a class clown who couldn\u2019t make anyone laugh. I was just trying a bit too hard.\u201d</p> <p>In his first year of studying English and drama at Bristol University, he spent a \u201cvery memorable summer\u201d putting on a production of <em>A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream</em> in the grounds of a country house. (More prosaically, he also draws on his experiences of working in a petrol station at this time: Charlie gets into a painful scrape involving free wine glasses.) Like Charlie, Nicholls felt, \u201cand I suppose still do a bit\u201d, a sense of not quite belonging in that privileged world, \u201cthat the culture was both interesting and quite excluding\u201d, a feeling that became overwhelming when he went to New York to study acting: \u201cIt was very Broadway oriented and I can\u2019t sing or dance. I thought it would be this exciting baptism of fire and it was actually just quite lonely.\u201d He took consolation in writing \u201cvery long, very \u2018written\u2019, sweated over\u201d letters to friends back home \u2013 his first attempts at comic writing.</p> <p>He suffered a \u201ccliched case of twentysomething anxiety\u201d, of not really knowing what he wanted to do with his life. Initially he had ambitions to become a standup comedian (\u201ca terrible idea. I didn\u2019t have the swagger\u201d) before falling into acting, which in reality meant years of small parts, bartending and some starry roles as the understudy. As he wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/30/david-nicholls-book-that-saved-him-pj-kavanagh-perfect-stranger-memoir-love\" title=\"\">in these pages</a>: \u201cI\u2019d committed myself to a profession for which I lacked not just talent and charisma, but the most basic of skills. Moving, standing still \u2013 things like that.\u201d</p> <p>While he loved the intensity and sociability of the theatre, \u201cthe whole business of putting on a play\u201d, the real appeal was that \u201cthey are written, they were characters and stories and jokes and they had an effect on people\u201d. And while his acting training \u201cwas a complete waste of time\u201d in terms of becoming an actor, it was a good apprenticeship for writing fiction, teaching him \u201cbasic tricks like, \u2018what did my character have for breakfast, and what\u2019s my favourite song?\u2019\u201d After some script-editing, turning down a minor role in an RSC world tour for radio work, he was asked to write for the hit TV comedy drama <em>Cold Feet</em>. \u201cI kind of owe it all to <em>Cold Feet</em>,\u201d he says now. It was just his second produced script, after co-adapting Sam Shepard\u2019s <em>Simpatico</em>, which also appeared in 2000, and he only wrote four episodes. For the record, he didn\u2019t kill off Rachel \u2013 that happened a couple of series later.</p> <p>Though scriptwriting \u201ccan be quite architectural and technical\u201d, it provided Nicholls with invaluable training in terms of plotting and pacing, sometimes lacking in more obviously \u201cliterary\u201d fiction. He quotes a piece of writing advice: \u201cDecide the effect you want to have on an audience and then do everything you can to achieve it.\u201d So if you set out to break the nation\u2019s heart, the challenge is how to do it \u201cwithout being hokey or sentimental or predictable or mawkish? How can you do it in a way that isn\u2019t cliched or familiar?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aff82fa2cd08294e35d76f876b99bc23c3704c4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aff82fa2cd08294e35d76f876b99bc23c3704c4a/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess in One Day.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A hymn to growing up\u2019 \u2026 Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess in <em>One Day.</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giles Keyte/Allstar/Focus Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what else I write now or for the next 20 years, I know I will always be the author of <em>One Day</em>,\u201d he says, without resentment. He feels he would be \u201ctoo self-conscious\u201d to write it now. Does it ever feel like a millstone? \u201cIt did a little while ago,\u201d he admits. But now he has \u201cnothing bad\u201d to say about it, except an urge to \u201ctweak it a bit \u2013 to take out a couple of pages, there\u2019s lots of gaucheness in it\u201d. After a couple of years of false starts, he scrapped 30,000 words of his next manuscript \u2013 \u201ca kind of perverse reaction \u2026 it was quite misanthropic and rancorous\u201d \u2013 before beginning on the novel that would become <em>Us</em>. And though he knew it would never be as big a hit as <em>One Day</em>, making the Booker longlist was \u201ca complete career highlight\u201d. He was also prepared for the inevitable raised eyebrows at his inclusion. Does such snobbery bother him? \u201cIf you sit down at your desk and think \u2018I\u2019m going to become a little bit more literary today\u2019, then you end up writing pretentiously,\u201d he says carefully. \u201cAt the same time, if you sit down and think, \u2018Well I\u2019m not going to deal with that because it\u2019s a bit dark or difficult or it\u2019s not necessarily crowd-pleasing\u2019, then that is just as limiting. So I genuinely don\u2019t think about it.\u201d But, he adds, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean literary approval isn\u2019t important\u201d.</p> <p>If his books are getting sadder and darker, and \u201cbetter\u201d, as he says with uncharacteristic assurance, it is perhaps because of his immersion in the gloomier worlds of Hardy and St Aubyn. Adapting other novelists\u2019 work has given him the courage, \u201ca sort of leg up\u201d, to take more risks and approach more complex issues (mental illness in this latest novel, for example: \u201cYou look back and think, \u2018We didn\u2019t call it that, but it was that\u2019,\u201d he says). But he doesn\u2019t \u201cfeel the need to write the great serious novel\u201d and, happily, has no intention of abandoning the genre for which he is best loved. \u201cCould I ever write a book that had no romantic comedy elements in it at all, no love story? I don\u2019t know if I could, or if I\u2019d want to. It is such an interesting, life-changing event in most people\u2019s lives. There\u2019s no reason why it can\u2019t be given weighty treatment.\u201d</p> <p>Although \u201cvery flattered\u201d by comparisons with comic \u2013 male \u2013 British writers such as Jonathan Coe and Nick Hornby, he feels he has been more influenced by contemporary American writers such as Lorrie Moore and Elizabeth Strout, as well as the 20th century heavyweights, JD Salinger (\u201cbrilliantly funny\u201d), James Salter and Philip Roth (<em>Goodbye Columbus</em> was a particular inspiration for <em>Sweet Sorrow</em>). He doesn\u2019t \u201cfeel part of a literary set\u201d or spend his time hanging out with Cumberbatch. He finds going on set \u201cquite frightening and stressful. You can\u2019t help them move the lights, you just feel like a spare part.\u201d And, despite arguably being at the top of his game, he is forever expecting it all \u201cto come to an end at some point\u201d. He is \u201cquite anxious\u201d, he admits. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think that will ever change. I used to worry about the fact that I worried.\u201d</p> <p>As Dexter tells Emma, in a much quoted line, if he could give her one gift for the rest of her life it would be \u201cConfidence \u2026 Either that or a scented candle\u201d. If you had told Nicholls\u2019s teenage, <em>Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide</em>-reading self what his own future had in store he says he would not have believed it. \u201cI had no expectation of it and would no more think that it would happen than that I would land on the moon.\u201d </p> <p>Today he works in an office round the corner from where he lives in Highbury in north London, with his partner of more than 20 years, Hannah Weaver, a script editor, clocking off at five to go home and cook tea. \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of romance to the idea of sitting there with a whisky and writing until three in the morning, but I\u2019ve got kids.\u201d After the filming of <em>Us</em>, he is looking forward to a break and reading a lot. And then, hopefully, novel number six will start to take shape.</p> <p>\u201cI should perhaps try and write a book that is entirely serious, or entirely comic,\u201d he muses. \u201cBut it seems to be, for me anyway, the natural way to tell the stories, the natural way to approach life and experience. That it is a mixture of comedy and pain. That sounds melodramatic or pompous, but it feels like the only voice I have.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 Sweet Sorrow by David Nicholls is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton (RRP \u00a320).

      "bodyText": "With the neat timing of one his books, David Nicholls\u2019s new novel Sweet Sorrow is published exactly 10 years after One Day, the blockbuster romantic comedy that made his name and the rest of us weep. For a long time, the orange book jacket was the brightest thing on the morning commute and an obligatory stripe on the bookshelves of anyone under 40. Set on St Swithin\u2019s day over the course of 20 years, it was a genuine word-of-mouth success; a film starring Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess as will-they-won\u2019t-they friends Emma and Dexter came out in 2011. Since then Nicholls has written two big-screen adaptations (Great Expectations and Far from the Madding Crowd), and his fourth novel, Us, which was longlisted for the Booker prize in 2014. In May he was awarded a Bafta for his TV screenplay of Patrick Melrose, which starred Benedict Cumberbatch. He\u2019s currently getting up at six in the morning to deliver scripts for the TV dramatisation of Us, which begins filming later this year. Not that he\u2019s complaining \u2013 \u201cI am so lucky,\u201d he marvels several times during our conversation. Despite all the accolades, not to mention dizzying sales figures, he is as self-deprecating as in his earliest interviews. Now 52, he seems as genuine and gently witty as you\u2019d expect from his fiction. In his Bafta acceptance speech, he thanked the producers for \u201cmiscasting\u201d him as a writer for Patrick Melrose. Although Edward St Aubyn\u2019s blistering autobiographical series, a bleak history of abuse as a child and later drug addiction, had been his \u201cdream project as a scriptwriter\u201d for many years \u2013 he first encountered it when working in a bookshop in Notting Hill back in the 90s \u2013 he wasn\u2019t, he says now, \u201can obvious choice\u201d for the job, a bit like signing up Richard Curtis to make The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. Part of the appeal of Melrose was that it is \u201ca sort of anti-romcom. For me as a writer there\u2019s very little love in it.\u201d But while it was \u201cexciting and exhilarating\u201d, it was also \u201ccompletely overwhelming\u201d, and after more than five years locked in St Aubyn\u2019s feverish aristocratic world he was ready to return to more familiar, sunnier territory. A story of first love, family breakdown and lost innocence, Sweet Sorrow is typical Nicholls: a little bit funny, a little bit sad with lashings of nostalgia. Set just before the turn of the millennium, it centres on a summer school production of Romeo and Juliet that brings together bored, lonely 16-year-old Charlie Lewis (a reluctant thespian with a troubled home life) and the lovely Fran Fisher. While One Day was his farewell to single life, \u201ca hymn to friendship and growing up\u201d, Us, about an ill-fated family trip across Europe, was his \u201cmid-life crisis book\u201d: his father died halfway through writing it, changing its focus from marriage to fatherhood. Nicholls\u2019s children (Max, now 13, and Romy, 11) were very young at the time, and he was preoccupied with the responsibilities of being a parent, \u201chow to do it well, the mistakes you make\u201d. Now Sweet Sorrow is an affecting combination of both: the youthful romance of One Day and the darker, adult failures of Us. \u201cI must stop using the word \u2018bittersweet\u2019,\u201d Nicholls says. But bittersweet is what he does best, along with a gift for making the reader feel young. Like all the most memorable coming-of-age novels, One Day pulled off the feat of seeming to speak for a generation while being written just for you. And, if Us failed to deliver the same body blow \u2013 you can\u2019t pull off that sort of trick twice \u2013 it was perhaps because it was hard to love its pernickety, middle-aged narrator. \u201cUs was quite a sad angry book,\u201d he says. With Sweet Sorrow, he was happy to write from a young perspective again. He conceived of it as a 50,000 word novella, \u201ca little sweet summer story,\u201d in the tradition of Alain-Fournier\u2019s Le Grand Meaulnes, but he enjoyed writing it so much that it \u201csort of sprawled a bit\u201d. \u201cThat time of life is characterised as wild and carefree, and actually that is very rarely the experience,\u201d Nicholls reflects. \u201cI wanted to write a teenage love story that had the booze and the sex and the kind of gaucheness and the passion for music and culture, but also had a sadness to it, confusion and a kind of romantic tender quality.\u201d (\u201cTender\u201d is another favourite Nicholls word.) His own summer waiting for exam results was spent working in a factory making coffee percolators, the highlight a three-day cycling holiday on the Isle of Wight with his friends Baz and Neil: \u201cThere was no great romance, no falling in love. It was really dogged and dull.\u201d Nicholls turned 16 in 1983. His debut novel, Starter for 10, about a working-class boy obsessed with getting on to University Challenge, was loaded with 80s nostalgia. It was picked up by the Richard and Judy Book Club in 2004 and Nicholls later adapted it into a film (with a small part for Cumberbatch as another, very different, Patrick). While Starter for 10 was strongly autobiographical, with Sweet Sorrow he wanted to create some distance from his own past, to avoid writing \u201cthe novel version of your own photo album\u201d.

If the novel has a soundtrack, it belongs to Pulp, in particular \u201cDavid\u2019s Last Summer\u201d, \u201ca brilliant song, a poem spoken to music\u201d about the last weekend of the summer holidays, with its \u201ckind of cider in the park mood\u201d that he hoped to distill on to the page. And of course 1997 was still pretty much pre-internet \u2013 \u201cmaybe the last year you could make a mixtape\u201d \u2013 and all that means for writing a love story: if only Romeo had had an iPhone rather than a dagger in his back pocket on the way to Padua. Surprisingly perhaps, Sweet Sorrow recalls last year\u2019s hit novel Normal People, another teenage romance, but with more sex and texting. Sally Rooney has been called \u201cthe Salinger of the Snapchat generation\u201d, but Nicholls is happy, for the moment, to leave digital speak and social media to the natives. \u201c\u2018Tweet\u2019 feels like quite a clumsy, ugly word that draws attention to itself,\u201d he says, although he knows he is going to have to \u201cgrapple with all that\u201d at some point. One thing that hasn\u2019t changed is the awkwardness of growing up a sensitive, clever boy in a small suburban town, the strict codes, aggression and rivalry of male friendships, so touchingly portrayed in both novels. \u201cTo not be a dick\u201d, as Charlie puts it, \u201cthat was the great rite of passage.\u201d \u201cIt feels like my most personal book, without being autobiographical,\u201d Nicholls says. \u201cIt\u2019s the one I feel the most emotionally attached to.\u201d He grew up in Eastleigh, Hampshire, which is not unlike the unnamed commuter town in the novel. His father was a maintenance engineer at the Mr Kipling cake factory and his mother worked for the council. Despite the acuteness with which Nicholls writes about divorce, his parents were happily married. \u201cI think so,\u201d he replies cautiously. \u201cIt was stable.\u201d Father-son relationships (all fairly disastrous) have been a preoccupation in his work \u2013 from his 2007 adaptation of Blake Morrison\u2019s memoir And When Did You Last See Your Father? to Great Expectations and Patrick Melrose. He is quick to stress that his own father was nothing like the troubled dads in either Us or Sweet Sorrow, but \u201cthe difficulties of the bond, fraught with communication pitfalls, is something that I\u2019ve come back to,\u201d he reflects. \u201cIt\u2019s something I think about a lot with my own son, and my memories of my father.\u201d A middle child, he has described his upbringing as \u201ca sort of Narnia and Coronation Street\u201d, in which he would be reading while the rest of his family watched TV. Unlike Charlie, he was \u201ca real swot. I poured everything into schoolwork.\u201d He was also \u201ca comedy nerd\u201d, given to quoting Monty Python and The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy: \u201cI was a class clown who couldn\u2019t make anyone laugh. I was just trying a bit too hard.\u201d In his first year of studying English and drama at Bristol University, he spent a \u201cvery memorable summer\u201d putting on a production of A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream in the grounds of a country house. (More prosaically, he also draws on his experiences of working in a petrol station at this time: Charlie gets into a painful scrape involving free wine glasses.) Like Charlie, Nicholls felt, \u201cand I suppose still do a bit\u201d, a sense of not quite belonging in that privileged world, \u201cthat the culture was both interesting and quite excluding\u201d, a feeling that became overwhelming when he went to New York to study acting: \u201cIt was very Broadway oriented and I can\u2019t sing or dance. I thought it would be this exciting baptism of fire and it was actually just quite lonely.\u201d He took consolation in writing \u201cvery long, very \u2018written\u2019, sweated over\u201d letters to friends back home \u2013 his first attempts at comic writing. He suffered a \u201ccliched case of twentysomething anxiety\u201d, of not really knowing what he wanted to do with his life. Initially he had ambitions to become a standup comedian (\u201ca terrible idea. I didn\u2019t have the swagger\u201d) before falling into acting, which in reality meant years of small parts, bartending and some starry roles as the understudy. As he wrote in these pages: \u201cI\u2019d committed myself to a profession for which I lacked not just talent and charisma, but the most basic of skills. Moving, standing still \u2013 things like that.\u201d While he loved the intensity and sociability of the theatre, \u201cthe whole business of putting on a play\u201d, the real appeal was that \u201cthey are written, they were characters and stories and jokes and they had an effect on people\u201d. And while his acting training \u201cwas a complete waste of time\u201d in terms of becoming an actor, it was a good apprenticeship for writing fiction, teaching him \u201cbasic tricks like, \u2018what did my character have for breakfast, and what\u2019s my favourite song?\u2019\u201d After some script-editing, turning down a minor role in an RSC world tour for radio work, he was asked to write for the hit TV comedy drama Cold Feet. \u201cI kind of owe it all to Cold Feet,\u201d he says now. It was just his second produced script, after co-adapting Sam Shepard\u2019s Simpatico, which also appeared in 2000, and he only wrote four episodes. For the record, he didn\u2019t kill off Rachel \u2013 that happened a couple of series later. Though scriptwriting \u201ccan be quite architectural and technical\u201d, it provided Nicholls with invaluable training in terms of plotting and pacing, sometimes lacking in more obviously \u201cliterary\u201d fiction. He quotes a piece of writing advice: \u201cDecide the effect you want to have on an audience and then do everything you can to achieve it.\u201d So if you set out to break the nation\u2019s heart, the challenge is how to do it \u201cwithout being hokey or sentimental or predictable or mawkish? How can you do it in a way that isn\u2019t cliched or familiar?\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what else I write now or for the next 20 years, I know I will always be the author of One Day,\u201d he says, without resentment. He feels he would be \u201ctoo self-conscious\u201d to write it now. Does it ever feel like a millstone? \u201cIt did a little while ago,\u201d he admits. But now he has \u201cnothing bad\u201d to say about it, except an urge to \u201ctweak it a bit \u2013 to take out a couple of pages, there\u2019s lots of gaucheness in it\u201d. After a couple of years of false starts, he scrapped 30,000 words of his next manuscript \u2013 \u201ca kind of perverse reaction \u2026 it was quite misanthropic and rancorous\u201d \u2013 before beginning on the novel that would become Us. And though he knew it would never be as big a hit as One Day, making the Booker longlist was \u201ca complete career highlight\u201d. He was also prepared for the inevitable raised eyebrows at his inclusion. Does such snobbery bother him? \u201cIf you sit down at your desk and think \u2018I\u2019m going to become a little bit more literary today\u2019, then you end up writing pretentiously,\u201d he says carefully. \u201cAt the same time, if you sit down and think, \u2018Well I\u2019m not going to deal with that because it\u2019s a bit dark or difficult or it\u2019s not necessarily crowd-pleasing\u2019, then that is just as limiting. So I genuinely don\u2019t think about it.\u201d But, he adds, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean literary approval isn\u2019t important\u201d. If his books are getting sadder and darker, and \u201cbetter\u201d, as he says with uncharacteristic assurance, it is perhaps because of his immersion in the gloomier worlds of Hardy and St Aubyn. Adapting other novelists\u2019 work has given him the courage, \u201ca sort of leg up\u201d, to take more risks and approach more complex issues (mental illness in this latest novel, for example: \u201cYou look back and think, \u2018We didn\u2019t call it that, but it was that\u2019,\u201d he says). But he doesn\u2019t \u201cfeel the need to write the great serious novel\u201d and, happily, has no intention of abandoning the genre for which he is best loved. \u201cCould I ever write a book that had no romantic comedy elements in it at all, no love story? I don\u2019t know if I could, or if I\u2019d want to. It is such an interesting, life-changing event in most people\u2019s lives. There\u2019s no reason why it can\u2019t be given weighty treatment.\u201d Although \u201cvery flattered\u201d by comparisons with comic \u2013 male \u2013 British writers such as Jonathan Coe and Nick Hornby, he feels he has been more influenced by contemporary American writers such as Lorrie Moore and Elizabeth Strout, as well as the 20th century heavyweights, JD Salinger (\u201cbrilliantly funny\u201d), James Salter and Philip Roth (Goodbye Columbus was a particular inspiration for Sweet Sorrow). He doesn\u2019t \u201cfeel part of a literary set\u201d or spend his time hanging out with Cumberbatch. He finds going on set \u201cquite frightening and stressful. You can\u2019t help them move the lights, you just feel like a spare part.\u201d And, despite arguably being at the top of his game, he is forever expecting it all \u201cto come to an end at some point\u201d. He is \u201cquite anxious\u201d, he admits. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think that will ever change. I used to worry about the fact that I worried.\u201d As Dexter tells Emma, in a much quoted line, if he could give her one gift for the rest of her life it would be \u201cConfidence \u2026 Either that or a scented candle\u201d. If you had told Nicholls\u2019s teenage, Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide-reading self what his own future had in store he says he would not have believed it. \u201cI had no expectation of it and would no more think that it would happen than that I would land on the moon.\u201d Today he works in an office round the corner from where he lives in Highbury in north London, with his partner of more than 20 years, Hannah Weaver, a script editor, clocking off at five to go home and cook tea. \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of romance to the idea of sitting there with a whisky and writing until three in the morning, but I\u2019ve got kids.\u201d After the filming of Us, he is looking forward to a break and reading a lot. And then, hopefully, novel number six will start to take shape. \u201cI should perhaps try and write a book that is entirely serious, or entirely comic,\u201d he muses. \u201cBut it seems to be, for me anyway, the natural way to tell the stories, the natural way to approach life and experience. That it is a mixture of comedy and pain. That sounds melodramatic or pompous, but it feels like the only voice I have.\u201d \u2022 Sweet Sorrow by David Nicholls is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton (RRP \u00a320). Nicholls will discuss Sweet Sorrow at a Guardian Live event in London on Monday 8 July. To book tickets visit gu.com/live-events.",

Birds of Passage (Curzon Artificial Eye, 15) In another bracing international genre twist, Colombian directors Ciro Guerra and Cristina Gallego bring a wealth of indigenous folklore to a humid crime-family saga, to ravishing effect. The Aftermath (Fox, 15) There isn\u2019t much to this post-second world war romance, in which Keira Knightley and Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd fall beautifully for each other in the ruins of Hamburg, but as cashmere-clad, rainy-afternoon viewing, it\u2019s diverting enough. The Hole in the Ground (Universal, 15) An effectively nervy bit of Irish gothic, first-time director Lee Cronin\u2019s haunted-child horror film generally plays by the genre rules, but does so with some flair. Swing Time (Sony, PG) The most readily swoon-worthy of Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers musicals \u2013 the one that gave the world The Way You Look Tonight \u2013 holds all its silvery lustre in this Criterion edition.",

But her desire to take the road less travelled goes back a long way. At the age of 12 Usoro-Brown asked her mother \u2013 herself a trailblazer in her career as a headteacher \u2013 to send her to boarding school. \u201cIt broke my mum\u2019s heart but we found a school that suited my needs and off I went,\u201d she says. \u201cI think the level of discipline instilled in me from such an early age has really allowed me to achieve success.\u201d</p> \n<p>By the age of 15 she was playing netball at county level and put herself forward for England trials. \u201cIt was two days long, the first day was fitness, the second playing in different combinations with different people,\u201d she recalls. \u201cAt the end of the trial you used to get an envelope. You would open it and it would either say: \u2018Congratulations\u2019 or \u2018Commiserations\u2019.

I went away and committed to it. That level of discipline we talked about from school; when you want something you need a little bit of luck. My talent will also get me so far but you have to work at it in order to earn the privilege.</p> \n<p>\u201cSo I remember going to the trials the second year. I completed exactly the same test on exactly the same trial day. I wasn\u2019t one of the best, there were girls who were scoring much higher than me, who were jumping much higher than me. But I remember getting my envelope at the end of the day and it said: \u2018Congratulations.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Now Usoro-Brown hopes to claim her 100th cap this summer. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of pressure, because of the results of last year, and we\u2019ve always said that no matter what happens this group needs to have fun,\u201d she says. \u201cWe play our best when we\u2019re doing that. The friendships that you see are real.\u201d</p> \n<p>It is in this fashion that the Roses hope to contribute to what has the promise of being a breakthrough summer for women\u2019s sport. \u201cIt could be huge! Huge!\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cWe were all gathered round the other day wishing the Lionesses good luck. We couldn\u2019t be more proud of them, the way they represent the nation, themselves and women\u2019s sport in general.

At the age of 12 Usoro-Brown asked her mother \u2013 herself a trailblazer in her career as a headteacher \u2013 to send her to boarding school. \u201cIt broke my mum\u2019s heart but we found a school that suited my needs and off I went,\u201d she says. \u201cI think the level of discipline instilled in me from such an early age has really allowed me to achieve success.\u201d By the age of 15 she was playing netball at county level and put herself forward for England trials. \u201cIt was two days long, the first day was fitness, the second playing in different combinations with different people,\u201d she recalls. \u201cAt the end of the trial you used to get an envelope. You would open it and it would either say: \u2018Congratulations\u2019 or \u2018Commiserations\u2019. I opened my envelope and it said: \u2018Commiserations, you haven\u2019t made the team.\u2019\u201d The response to her first serious setback was to come back for more. \u201cI remember asking the coach: \u2018What is it that I need to do?\u2019\u201d Usoro-Brown says. \u201cThey gave me a training programme, a diet plan and some things I needed to work on on court. I went away and committed to it. That level of discipline we talked about from school; when you want something you need a little bit of luck. My talent will also get me so far but you have to work at it in order to earn the privilege. \u201cSo I remember going to the trials the second year. I completed exactly the same test on exactly the same trial day. I wasn\u2019t one of the best, there were girls who were scoring much higher than me, who were jumping much higher than me. But I remember getting my envelope at the end of the day and it said: \u2018Congratulations.\u2019\u201d Now Usoro-Brown hopes to claim her 100th cap this summer. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of pressure, because of the results of last year, and we\u2019ve always said that no matter what happens this group needs to have fun,\u201d she says. \u201cWe play our best when we\u2019re doing that. The friendships that you see are real.\u201d It is in this fashion that the Roses hope to contribute to what has the promise of being a breakthrough summer for women\u2019s sport. \u201cIt could be huge! Huge!\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cWe were all gathered round the other day wishing the Lionesses good luck. We couldn\u2019t be more proud of them, the way they represent the nation, themselves and women\u2019s sport in general. Hopefully we can follow in their lead \u2026 and if possible get the gold medal.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>\u201cI wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach,\u201d wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/henry-david-thoreau\" title=\"\">Henry David Thoreau</a> of his famous decision to live in a shed, in the woods, a few miles outside the town of Concord, Massachusetts. \u201cSimplicity, simplicity, simplicity!\u201d he went on; \u201cI say, let your affairs be as two or three, and not a hundred or a thousand; instead of a million count half a dozen, and keep your accounts on your thumb nail.\u201d</p> <p>Thoreau\u2019s neighbours thought him selfish \u2013 but we\u2019re still reading about Thoreau. Catrina Davies doesn\u2019t presume she\u2019ll still be read in a century and a half, but with <em>Homesick</em>, her memoir of life in a Cornish shed, she\u2019s done something more memorable than the older people and holidaymakers who condemn her choices. There are other obvious differences: \u201cThoreau lived in a shed to make a statement,\u201d she says, \u201cwhile I was doing it because I seemed to have run out of other options.\u201d</p> <p>Davies\u2019s options ran out because of the savagery of the UK\u2019s current housing crisis. A box room in an overcrowded Bristol house cost her \u00a3400 a month \u2013 a sum almost impossible to raise given her irregular income teaching cello and writing music. She\u2019d struggled through her teens and 20s with drug use and eating disorders, but in her 30s was trying to live a different sort of life \u2013 one more nourishing for herself and the planet.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach,\u201d wrote Henry David Thoreau of his famous decision to live in a shed, in the woods, a few miles outside the town of Concord, Massachusetts. \u201cSimplicity, simplicity, simplicity!\u201d he went on; \u201cI say, let your affairs be as two or three, and not a hundred or a thousand; instead of a million count half a dozen, and keep your accounts on your thumb nail.\u201d Thoreau\u2019s neighbours thought him selfish \u2013 but we\u2019re still reading about Thoreau. Catrina Davies doesn\u2019t presume she\u2019ll still be read in a century and a half, but with Homesick, her memoir of life in a Cornish shed, she\u2019s done something more memorable than the older people and holidaymakers who condemn her choices. There are other obvious differences: \u201cThoreau lived in a shed to make a statement,\u201d she says, \u201cwhile I was doing it because I seemed to have run out of other options.\u201d Davies\u2019s options ran out because of the savagery of the UK\u2019s current housing crisis. A box room in an overcrowded Bristol house cost her \u00a3400 a month \u2013 a sum almost impossible to raise given her irregular income teaching cello and writing music. She\u2019d struggled through her teens and 20s with drug use and eating disorders, but in her 30s was trying to live a different sort of life \u2013 one more nourishing for herself and the planet. Davies knew she could have taken a steady, boring, poorly paid job, but doing so would have obliged her to give up many aspects of life that for her, made it worth living. \u201cThe opposite of slavery is freedom, not idleness,\u201d she writes: \u201cFreedom to work, and work hard, on things that matter to me. Freedom to be paid badly to do things well. Freedom to refuse to do bad things just because they pay well.\u201d There\u2019s something admirable in her refusal to accept the realities of the modern workplace, and willingness to live with the consequences. When the indignities of sharing one kitchen and one bathroom with four unrelated adults and a child became overwhelming, Davies packed her van and moved into an old shed near Land\u2019s End \u2013 a shed her father once used as his architect\u2019s office before his business went under on Black Wednesday in 1992. The Davies family home was repossessed, her parents\u2019 separation followed; she notes bleakly that with this crisis \u201cmy childhood ended\u201d. In the last 20 years, average house prices have grown about seven times faster than the average income of young people \u2013 lack of home ownership is now a fact of life for the young: \u201cIf food prices had risen as fast as house prices in the years since I came of age, a chicken would cost \u00a351.\u201d Cornwall\u2019s depressed and seasonal economy offers an average full-time income of just \u00a318,000 a year \u2013 about a quarter of the income you\u2019d need to get a mortgage on an average house. In places the book reads as a lament for the economy of Cornwall, which voted for Brexit because something, anything, had to change.

      "body": "<p>If you discovered that a major mobile phone company had allowed someone else to take out a contract in your name, you would rightly be furious.</p> <p>But what if that \u201csomeone else\u201d turned out to be your mother, who hadn\u2019t paid the bill and as a result, the company slapped a black mark on your credit record to the extent you couldn\u2019t get a mortgage?</p> <p>That is the highly unusual position that a couple from the West Midlands have found themselves in. David Platt and Tessa James* say they have been left astonished by the fact that Tesco Mobile gave Platt\u2019s mother an iPhone contract in his name.</p> <p>It then added insult to injury, they say, by refusing to take the \u00a3592 default off Platt\u2019s credit file \u2013 even after staff were told that he and his mother were estranged, and she had defrauded Tesco Mobile. Instead, the firm advised Platt to take his mum to the small claims court.</p> <p>The case shows how difficult it can be to get a company to take you seriously if you have been defrauded by a relative or, more often, a former partner. It is also further evidence of how a missed mobile payment can ruin your financial record.</p> <p>The first the couple knew of the mobile contract was when they recently investigated why they had been turned down for their first mortgage. They were told to look at Platt\u2019s credit file, where they soon discovered the default. It related to a \u00a3592 balance outstanding on the mobile phone account.</p> <p>It then emerged that in 2015, Platt\u2019s mother had succeeded in persuading Tesco Mobile to give her a new iPhone on a contract taken out in his name.</p> <p>He had been living with her at the time so she would have known most, if not all, of his personal details: date of birth, mother\u2019s maiden name and so on. Crucially, she was able to hand over her own bank account details to cover the monthly payments, and grab letters sent to him. It left him none the wiser as there was no trace of any payments on his account.</p> <p>The couple suspect Platt\u2019s mother did it because she would have been refused for a contract in her own name, due to previous financial problems. When she did not make the required payments, Tesco Mobile put the account into default.</p> <p>\u201cDavid no longer lives at home, and he and his mother don\u2019t talk to each other and are essentially estranged,\u201d says Tessa. \u201cWhen we discovered what had happened, I messaged his mother about this, and she didn\u2019t deny it. In fact, she appears to find the whole thing hilarious but for us this has been a nightmare.\u201d</p> <p>The couple say they were told they would have to pay the \u00a3592 debt and would face having to come up with a much higher deposit of 15% if they wanted a mortgage, which was near-impossible for them.</p> <p>\u201cEver since we discovered this, we have been battling with Tesco Mobile to get them to sort this out. They were quite happy to give a phone to someone without checking that their ID matched up \u2013 someone who handed over a bank account in a different name. But their stance has been that this can\u2019t have been fraud because it\u2019s your mum. They told us they believe it is a civil matter.</p> <p>\u201cWe have been to the police, who took the matter seriously and gave us a crime reference number but Tesco maintains it has done nothing wrong and will not remove the non-payment marker against his name. It has been a complete nightmare \u2013 one we can\u2019t resolve,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"79235792c4ad5563ea0ad034409e103316f990f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79235792c4ad5563ea0ad034409e103316f990f8/0_85_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tesco Mobile\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tesco Mobile has now written off David Platt\u2019s debt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: M4OS Photos/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Following Guardian Money\u2019s intervention, Tesco Mobile, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/apr/30/mobile-broadband-uk-best-worst-providers-complaints\" title=\"\">customer satisfaction figures have fallen</a> in recent months, had a swift change of heart. It has written off the debt and removed the default from Platt\u2019s credit file.</p> <p>Tesco Mobile told us it made numerous attempts to advise Platt about the debt, including sending letters to the family home.</p> <p>\u201cWe were contacted by the customer earlier this year but the matter was classed as a civil issue due to the information provided, and he was advised of what action to take. Now he has been able to provide a crime reference number, we have changed the status of the incident to fraud. Our customers\u2019 security is of utmost importance to us and we have introduced even stronger security measures to our end-to-end ID verification, which now prevent customers from using a different account name to the bank details they provide,\u201d the firm said.</p> <p>The couple are not the first to find someone has used their ID to take out a mobile contract.

      "bodyText": "If you discovered that a major mobile phone company had allowed someone else to take out a contract in your name, you would rightly be furious. But what if that \u201csomeone else\u201d turned out to be your mother, who hadn\u2019t paid the bill and as a result, the company slapped a black mark on your credit record to the extent you couldn\u2019t get a mortgage? That is the highly unusual position that a couple from the West Midlands have found themselves in. David Platt and Tessa James* say they have been left astonished by the fact that Tesco Mobile gave Platt\u2019s mother an iPhone contract in his name. It then added insult to injury, they say, by refusing to take the \u00a3592 default off Platt\u2019s credit file \u2013 even after staff were told that he and his mother were estranged, and she had defrauded Tesco Mobile. Instead, the firm advised Platt to take his mum to the small claims court. The case shows how difficult it can be to get a company to take you seriously if you have been defrauded by a relative or, more often, a former partner. It is also further evidence of how a missed mobile payment can ruin your financial record. The first the couple knew of the mobile contract was when they recently investigated why they had been turned down for their first mortgage. They were told to look at Platt\u2019s credit file, where they soon discovered the default. It related to a \u00a3592 balance outstanding on the mobile phone account. It then emerged that in 2015, Platt\u2019s mother had succeeded in persuading Tesco Mobile to give her a new iPhone on a contract taken out in his name. He had been living with her at the time so she would have known most, if not all, of his personal details: date of birth, mother\u2019s maiden name and so on. Crucially, she was able to hand over her own bank account details to cover the monthly payments, and grab letters sent to him. It left him none the wiser as there was no trace of any payments on his account. The couple suspect Platt\u2019s mother did it because she would have been refused for a contract in her own name, due to previous financial problems. When she did not make the required payments, Tesco Mobile put the account into default. \u201cDavid no longer lives at home, and he and his mother don\u2019t talk to each other and are essentially estranged,\u201d says Tessa. \u201cWhen we discovered what had happened, I messaged his mother about this, and she didn\u2019t deny it. In fact, she appears to find the whole thing hilarious but for us this has been a nightmare.\u201d The couple say they were told they would have to pay the \u00a3592 debt and would face having to come up with a much higher deposit of 15% if they wanted a mortgage, which was near-impossible for them. \u201cEver since we discovered this, we have been battling with Tesco Mobile to get them to sort this out. They were quite happy to give a phone to someone without checking that their ID matched up \u2013 someone who handed over a bank account in a different name. But their stance has been that this can\u2019t have been fraud because it\u2019s your mum. They told us they believe it is a civil matter. \u201cWe have been to the police, who took the matter seriously and gave us a crime reference number but Tesco maintains it has done nothing wrong and will not remove the non-payment marker against his name. It has been a complete nightmare \u2013 one we can\u2019t resolve,\u201d she says. Following Guardian Money\u2019s intervention, Tesco Mobile, whose customer satisfaction figures have fallen in recent months, had a swift change of heart. It has written off the debt and removed the default from Platt\u2019s credit file. Tesco Mobile told us it made numerous attempts to advise Platt about the debt, including sending letters to the family home. \u201cWe were contacted by the customer earlier this year but the matter was classed as a civil issue due to the information provided, and he was advised of what action to take. Now he has been able to provide a crime reference number, we have changed the status of the incident to fraud. Our customers\u2019 security is of utmost importance to us and we have introduced even stronger security measures to our end-to-end ID verification, which now prevent customers from using a different account name to the bank details they provide,\u201d the firm said. The couple are not the first to find someone has used their ID to take out a mobile contract. In 2012, Money revealed how lax security measures at mobile firms allowed customers using fake ID to take out contracts. One reader had nine contracts taken out in his name. Another had a similar problem with Tesco Mobile, which was said to have had a particular issue with fraud back then. Pressure to make sales was blamed for lax security. Platt is not the first to suffer financial abuse by a family member. A 2014 Citizens Advice report described it as a growing yet rarely discussed problem. James Jones at credit reference agency Experian says such cases are unusual. \u201cI have seen the occasional case where credit has been taken out by a family member without the person\u2019s knowledge \u2013 which is, without a doubt, ID fraud \u2013 but it\u2019s quite rare. Experian has a special team set up for victims of fraud,\u201d he says. The number is 0344 481 8000. *Names have been changed.",

And knowing I had rescued perfectly good food from the dumpster seemed to add an extra layer of enjoyment to my meal.</p> <p>I was also impressed by how much food I was given.

I\u2019m Muslim, and in our holy book there is a verse that says: eat, drink \u2013 but don\u2019t waste.\u201d</p> <p>The app brings in new customers, he says. Like me, most of the people who purchase food from his cafe via the app have never been in before.</p> <p>A few days later, I collect my next magic bag from Benets Cafe, opposite King\u2019s College Chapel, at 3.30pm. It contains a chicken pesto sandwich and a ham and cheese croissant \u2013 and costs just \u00a33.59.</p> <p>At the counter I meet a hard-working university researcher, Ruoyun Hui, collecting her own magic bag. She says she has used the app a handful of times, \u201cusually when I\u2019m busy with work and miss mealtimes\u201d. She does it both to get a bargain and to help stop food waste \u2013 and says she\u2019s happy with what she gets. \u201cMost of the time it\u2019s good value.\u201d</p> <p>We are told the food in the bag must be eaten that day, but I put the croissant in the fridge to eat for breakfast the next morning. It tastes just fine.</p> <p>I also visit Harriets Cafe Tearooms, well-known in Cambridge for its afternoon teas. The app says I can collect my magic bag between 5pm and 6pm, but when I turn up just before 6pm, the cafe is locked shut. I bang on the door and show the app through the window, and luckily a waiter opens up and hands me a beautiful box wrapped in ribbon. Not knowing what I would find inside was exciting, and frankly I couldn\u2019t wait to unwrap it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"104f79558355f0583fb5930ad75a6adc6d973c9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/104f79558355f0583fb5930ad75a6adc6d973c9c/0_263_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donna Ferguson enjoys a meal made with food sourced through the Too Good to Go app.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donna Ferguson enjoys a meal made with food sourced through the Too Good to Go app.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jill Mead/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>When I do, I find four cheese scones, normally \u00a33.20 for two, and two broken pistachio macaroons, normally \u00a32.10 each.

      "bodyText": "Cafe owner Mehmet Boyraz is trying to reduce his food waste for religious reasons. Upmarket tearoom manager Catia Teixeira does it to avoid chucking freshly baked scones in the bin. And sandwich shop customer Ruoyun Hui wants to save money and the planet. All three are enthusiastic users of Too Good To Go, an app that enables restaurants and cafes to sell food they would otherwise have thrown away \u2013 thereby offering customers who care about food waste the chance to grab something cheap to eat and make a difference at the same time. Rock-bottom prices are not unusual: to \u00a310.60 worth of great food for \u00a33.49, anyone? I personally discovered it late one evening, sitting in my local Yo! Sushi restaurant in central Cambridge. The restaurant was starting to close and the conveyor belt, which had been full of delicious-looking, freshly made food, was suddenly completely empty. \u201cWhere has all the food gone?\u201d I asked the waitress. Some of it, I was told, would be thrown away, but the restaurant does also use Too Good To Go to get rid of food. After downloading the app, I saw that a dozen restaurants within walking distance were offering \u201cmagic bags\u201d of leftover food. Each was apparently worth between \u00a38 and \u00a312, but would cost just \u00a33 to \u00a34. To get a bag, I would have to pay for it through the app \u2013 without knowing exactly what would be in it, though there\u2019s a description of what sort of food is sold at that particular place \u2013 and agree to collect it during a short window of time allotted by the restaurant. A wide range of scrumptious delights were on offer, from a global food buffet and waffles to croissants, noodles, cakes and sandwiches. But would all this half-price leftover food taste OK? Would I really get good value for money and rescue food from the bin at the same time? Or was Too Good To Go, in fact, too good to be true? I decided to try it out. I bought my first lunch with the app for \u00a33.49 from Cafe Bread &amp; Butter, a small cafe not far from the River Cam that I had never been to before, even though it was a short 10-minute stroll from my house. Unfortunately, I could only collect my lunch between 2.30pm and 3.30pm, which meant I was starving by the time I arrived. I also had no choice about what I would be given: it turned out to be a jacket potato with cheese, beans and salad, a packet of salt and pepper crisps (again, I couldn\u2019t choose which flavour) and a strawberry Ribena. Luckily, I love jacket potatoes. And knowing I had rescued perfectly good food from the dumpster seemed to add an extra layer of enjoyment to my meal. I was also impressed by how much food I was given. Normally, that lunch would have cost \u00a36.50, says Boyraz. He signed up with the app three months ago. \u201cI thought stopping food waste sounded like a good idea.

Roughly the size of three football pitches, Le Freeport has four bullion chambers, space for 750,000 bottles of wine, and airport landing bays designed for armoured vehicles.</p> <p>The squat four-storey building is designed to look like a jewellery box, not an obvious feature to the casual viewer looking through the barbed wire fence and metal gates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33e6847a70caf43edb9eea4a37fc55ed1ce828b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33e6847a70caf43edb9eea4a37fc55ed1ce828b2/0_336_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Le Freeport, in Luxembourg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Le Freeport, in Luxembourg, doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s stuffed full of fine art, fine wine and vintage cars.

Promoters say clients benefit from lower insurance premiums and the easy access to the airport tarmac.</p> <p>The opening of Le Freeport in 2014 \u2013 to capitalise on the dash for safer assets after the financial crisis \u2013 was not universally welcomed in Luxembourg. A local group of artists, Richtung 22, wrote and performed a satirical play about what its spokeswoman Ada G\u00fcnther calls a \u201cfortress for art\u201d. The play also took aim at what the authors see as the government\u2019s aim to make the Grand Duchy \u201ca haven for the super-rich from other countries\u201d, G\u00fcnther said.</p> <p>Doubts mushroomed in 2015 when the Swiss businessman and majority shareholder in Le Freeport, Yves Bouvier, was arrested on charges of defrauding clients by misrepresenting the value of artworks. Bouvier, who owns a stake in the Geneva free port and created the Singapore free port, denies all charges and legal cases are ongoing.</p> <p>In response to the furore, the Luxembourg government tightened anti-money-laundering controls. Since 2015 the three logistics firms licensed to work in Le Freeport have been obliged to keep records of the beneficial owner of property stored in the warehouse. Luxembourg customs officers inspect everything that arrives through the doors.</p> <p>\u201cIn 2015, the government decided to evaluate the free port in Luxembourg and came to the conclusion that there were indeed money-laundering risks,\u201d said Djuna Bernard, co-president of Luxembourg\u2019s Green party in a statement.</p> <p>The Greens pressed for transparency after joining a coalition government in 2013. Luxembourg is \u201cthe only country in which the Direct Tax Office has access to the [ultimate beneficial owner] data,\u201d Bernard said.</p> <p>The European parliament thinks Le Freeport remains a money-laundering risk. \u201cEverything is very opaque and murky,\u201d says Ana Gomes, a Portuguese socialist who stood down as an MEP this week. Gomes, a former member of the parliament\u2019s special committee on tax evasion, visited Le Freeport in February 2018, but remains unconvinced by its controls.</p> <p>Gomes thinks Luxembourg police and tax authorities do not have adequate access to the data collected by the logistics firms working in Le Freeport. \u201cIt is a major scheme to evade paying taxes, to avoid money-laundering controls,\u201d she alleges.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/le_freeport_map/giv-3902ftfzZdTCZ2AJ/\" data-alt=\"Luxembourg map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/07/le_freeport_map/giv-3902ftfzZdTCZ2AJ/\">Luxembourg map</a> </figure>  <p>Luxembourg\u2019s Indirect Tax Office (AED) found Le Freeport to be \u201chigh risk in relation to money laundering\u201d, according to evidence collected by the European parliament.</p> <p>Le Freeport has strongly rejected the allegations. \u201cThe claims that Le Freeport could be used for money laundering and/or the concealment of stolen art are absurd and without factual basis,\u201d said a company representative. \u201cLe Freeport is probably the most controlled storage place in the European Union.\u201d</p> <p>Companies working at Le Freeport also say strict laws have cost them clients.</p> <p>The unexpected introduction of anti-money-laundering rules put Le Freeport at a \u201ccompetitive disadvantage\u201d, one Freeport logistics operator told the European parliament. \u201cClients like their privacy and are thus reluctant to provide their data.

      "bodyText": "Along with free trade deals, tax cuts for high earners and the threat of a no-deal Brexit, special tax-free zones are likely to feature in a Boris Johnson premiership. The frontrunner to move into No 10 told a Tory hustings event this week that the UK could have six tax-free zones, known as free ports. Belfast, Teesside and Aberdeen are among potential locations. A US congressional report in 2013 estimated there were 3,500 free ports across 135 countries, hosting tax-free zones spanning from car production to fine art storage. One of those zones, and a potential model for the UK\u2019s post-Brexit future, can be found at the end of a motorway, in a warehouse backing on to Luxembourg airport. This is no ordinary warehouse: Le Freeport is a maximum security centre for the super-rich to store art, fine wine, vintage cars and other treasures. Roughly the size of three football pitches, Le Freeport has four bullion chambers, space for 750,000 bottles of wine, and airport landing bays designed for armoured vehicles. The squat four-storey building is designed to look like a jewellery box, not an obvious feature to the casual viewer looking through the barbed wire fence and metal gates. The interior is said to be luxurious, with chic rooms for wealthy clients to arrange sales or simply contemplate their treasures within the confines of the thick walls. \u201cIt is more akin to a contemporary art museum than a warehouse,\u201d says David Arendt, former managing director of Le Freeport. The draw for super-rich clients is not having to pay import taxes, VAT or capital gains tax on anything stored or sold within its confines. Promoters say clients benefit from lower insurance premiums and the easy access to the airport tarmac. The opening of Le Freeport in 2014 \u2013 to capitalise on the dash for safer assets after the financial crisis \u2013 was not universally welcomed in Luxembourg. A local group of artists, Richtung 22, wrote and performed a satirical play about what its spokeswoman Ada G\u00fcnther calls a \u201cfortress for art\u201d. The play also took aim at what the authors see as the government\u2019s aim to make the Grand Duchy \u201ca haven for the super-rich from other countries\u201d, G\u00fcnther said. Doubts mushroomed in 2015 when the Swiss businessman and majority shareholder in Le Freeport, Yves Bouvier, was arrested on charges of defrauding clients by misrepresenting the value of artworks. Bouvier, who owns a stake in the Geneva free port and created the Singapore free port, denies all charges and legal cases are ongoing. In response to the furore, the Luxembourg government tightened anti-money-laundering controls. Since 2015 the three logistics firms licensed to work in Le Freeport have been obliged to keep records of the beneficial owner of property stored in the warehouse. Luxembourg customs officers inspect everything that arrives through the doors. \u201cIn 2015, the government decided to evaluate the free port in Luxembourg and came to the conclusion that there were indeed money-laundering risks,\u201d said Djuna Bernard, co-president of Luxembourg\u2019s Green party in a statement. The Greens pressed for transparency after joining a coalition government in 2013. Luxembourg is \u201cthe only country in which the Direct Tax Office has access to the [ultimate beneficial owner] data,\u201d Bernard said. The European parliament thinks Le Freeport remains a money-laundering risk. \u201cEverything is very opaque and murky,\u201d says Ana Gomes, a Portuguese socialist who stood down as an MEP this week. Gomes, a former member of the parliament\u2019s special committee on tax evasion, visited Le Freeport in February 2018, but remains unconvinced by its controls. Gomes thinks Luxembourg police and tax authorities do not have adequate access to the data collected by the logistics firms working in Le Freeport. \u201cIt is a major scheme to evade paying taxes, to avoid money-laundering controls,\u201d she alleges. Luxembourg\u2019s Indirect Tax Office (AED) found Le Freeport to be \u201chigh risk in relation to money laundering\u201d, according to evidence collected by the European parliament. Le Freeport has strongly rejected the allegations. \u201cThe claims that Le Freeport could be used for money laundering and/or the concealment of stolen art are absurd and without factual basis,\u201d said a company representative. \u201cLe Freeport is probably the most controlled storage place in the European Union.\u201d Companies working at Le Freeport also say strict laws have cost them clients. The unexpected introduction of anti-money-laundering rules put Le Freeport at a \u201ccompetitive disadvantage\u201d, one Freeport logistics operator told the European parliament. \u201cClients like their privacy and are thus reluctant to provide their data. The same goes for merchants and dealers,\u201d said the operator, who estimated Luxembourg\u2019s tougher rules cost them up to 30 clients, who went to rivals with \u201cmore discretion\u201d. There are dozens of free ports inside the European Union, but all have to abide by EU law, including an update of anti-money-laundering rules that comes into force in 2020, obliging free ports to carry out due diligence on clients. There are 80 free ports in EU member state territories and their dependencies. This includes a free port on the Isle of Man, the British crown dependency, which is neither part of the EU nor the UK. After Brexit or a Brexit transition period, the UK would no longer be obliged to follow EU anti-money-laundering rules. But free port critics argue the UK would pay a price for abandoning EU standards. \u201cIf politicians in Britain think Britain should go rogue in financial services, yes it makes sense to have a free port, but I don\u2019t think it is something good in the long run for the reputation of Britain,\u201d said Gomes. If Brussels deems British tax loopholes excessive, the UK could forfeit access to European markets, or even end up on a tax blacklist, she added. \u201cIf that is the way for Britain after Brexit, if so, there are no shortage of ways in which the EU can react.\u201d",

Visitors can walk through this turf-roofed timber building to experience simulations of various habitats, including a wild cat den and a wood at night. Its Lochview Tearoom serves full Scottish breakfasts and light lunches, or buy sandwiches and cake to take away.</p> <p><strong>Day two</strong> Hire a bike from <a href=\"http://sunartcycles.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Sunart Cycles</a> (\u00a320 a day) and either pedal independently or ask for a pre-planned tour. Bikes can be dropped off for no extra charge in the towns of Acharacle and Salen. Cycling on the peninsula itself is restricted mostly to the main road, which can get busy in summer. There are cycle paths on the other side of Loch Sunart in Morvern, however, which include routes through nature reserves and the ancient forest of <a href=\"https://www.nature.scot/enjoying-outdoors/scotlands-national-nature-reserves/ariundle-oakwood-national-nature-reserve\" title=\"\">Ariund</a><a href=\"https://www.nature.scot/enjoying-outdoors/scotlands-national-nature-reserves/ariundle-oakwood-national-nature-reserve\" title=\"\">le Oakwood</a>. Suitable for hybrid and mountain bikes, there are several challenging off-road tracks.</p> <p><strong>Day three</strong> Climb Ben Hiant to get 360-degree views of the peninsula. Not as forbidding as it might sound, this extinct volcano is easy to scale \u2013 it\u2019s a mere 528 metres high and there is a clear path to the top. As you ascend, look out for signs of pine martens and red deer. If visibility is good, you can see the islands of Muck, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/may/29/eigg-island-scotland-cycling-walking-kayaking\" title=\"\">Eigg</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/aug/02/sailing-trip-scotland-hebrides-islands-adam-nicolson-wainwright-prize-2018\" title=\"\">Rum</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/13/go-whale-watching-off-the-scottish-coast\" title=\"\">Mull</a>, Coll and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/jul/26/tiree-inner-hebrides-scotland-white-beach-sunshine-island\" title=\"\">Tiree</a> from the top, as well as the rest of Ardnamurchan spilling out before you.

With a guide (and other canoeists), you get to stop off at otherwise inaccessible islands and forests, or light a fire and brew a cup of tea. There may also be seals. Journeys take up most of the day and cost \u00a380 adult, \u00a350 child.</p> <p><strong>Day five</strong> Pack provisions and head to Sanna Bay, at the tip of the peninsula, as there is nothing to buy when you arrive. A remote and lovely spot with soft white sand beaches, turquoise seas and flower-rich machair in spring and summer, it is easy to spend hours here doing nothing very much apart from a spot of rockpooling or beachcombing. There are plenty of wildlife-spotting opportunities, too: sand martens nest in the dune cliffs; otters forage along the shore; butterflies feed on wildflowers; you may even spot a white-tailed eagle.</p> <p><strong>Stay</strong> <a href=\"https://www.steadingholidaycottages.co.uk/cottage-keepers-west/\" title=\"\">Keeper\u2019s West </a><a href=\"https://www.steadingholidaycottages.co.uk/cottage-keepers-west/\" title=\"\">cottage</a> (sleeps four, from \u00a3428 to \u00a3676 a week) sits beneath the Ardnamurchan Lighthouse at the edge of the peninsula. <a href=\"http://sannabaycottage.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Tir Nan Og</a> (sleeps six, from \u00a3340 to \u00a3640 a week) is a simple whitewashed stone cottage, minutes away from the white sand beach of Sanna Bay.</p> <h2><strong>Morecambe Bay, Cumbria/Lancashire</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"ce6a5cebfc20e5a92102b4e833f4bc73a2aa7c61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce6a5cebfc20e5a92102b4e833f4bc73a2aa7c61/0_1024_5119_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aerial image of Piel Island, Furness Peninsula\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Royal male \u2026 Piel Island has its own \u2018king\u2019 \u2013 also the pub landlord.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: robertharding/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The vast, shimmering sands of Morecambe Bay may look beguiling but the quicksand and mudflats are notoriously dangerous.

This art deco smasher, with its curvilinear white facade, has become a destination in its own right. Sit by a window and look out over Morecambe Bay\u2019s seemingly never-ending expanse. On 31 August\u20131 September, Hemingway Designs is holding its annual <a href=\"https://www.vintagefestival.co.uk/vintage-by-the-sea-2018/\" title=\"\">Vintage By The Sea Festival</a> (free entry) at the hotel. Expect many moustachioed and red-lipsticked retro enthusiasts enjoying the vintage fairground, live music, market and classic cars.</p> <p><strong>Day two</strong> Walk south on Morecambe\u2019s promenade to the very end \u2013 about three miles, depending on where you start. This flat and undemanding route, also ideal for cycling, skirts Morecambe Bay. You might see wading birds such as oystercatchers and turnstone digging around in the mudflats for food \u2013 especially at low tide when they are driven closer to the promenade. You\u2019ll definitely see the wonderful statue of Eric Morecambe in one of his characteristic poses with a pair of binoculars around his neck (he was a keen ornithologist). At the prom\u2019s end, walk up to Heysham Head and the ruined eighth-century St Patrick\u2019s Chapel (rumoured to be where St Patrick came ashore following a shipwreck), which has great views of the bay. And look out for the body-shaped pre-Norman graves, carved out of rock and facing towards the ocean.</p> <p><strong>Day three</strong> Fortify yourself with breakfast at <a href=\"https://en-gb.facebook.com/TheViewCafeMorecambe/\" title=\"\">View Caf\u00e9</a>, decorated with vinyl and music memorabilia. A designated Spam Menu includes Spam fritters, but there are other, more contemporary \u2013 and more appealing \u2013 options. Hire a bike at Morecambe station from <a href=\"https://www.bikeandgo.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Bike and Go</a> (\u00a310 for an annual subscription, then \u00a33.80 a day), then join <a href=\"https://www.sustrans.org.uk/ncn/map/route/the-bay-cycle-way?gclid=CjwKCAjwr8zoBRA0EiwANmvpYKsNN0kU58qxn3fjNAKyvSXVPN3B0Czllxai5d_k4I1mgrdNHqsU-hoCUA4QAvD_BwE\" title=\"\">the Bay Cycle Way</a> and pedal part of the route out of Morecambe, heading north along the coast.

On arrival, check out the station, with its elegant red-and-green wrought iron pillars supporting glass platform canopies. Grange-over-Sands was a popular resort during the Victorian sea-bathing craze and still has a rarefied air. Its sheltered position means it also has many subtropical plants along the promenade and in the Ornamental Gardens. It\u2019s not the place to swim, however: at extreme low tides, the sea can be around 10 miles away.</p> <p><strong>Day five</strong> Have an audience with the King of <a href=\"http://www.pielisland.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Piel Island</a>. This 50-acre kingdom off the tip of Furness peninsula, Barrow-in-Furness, comprises a ruined 14th-century castle, a row of houses and the Ship Inn. The landlord, Steve Chattaway, is also the king \u2013 a title he inherited with ownership of the pub. You can camp here (\u00a35 per tent, must be pre-booked) and the pub also serves food, but most visitors come for the day. In high season (April-Sept), catch the ferry from Roa Island, which is connected to the mainland by an isthmus (daily 11am-4.30pm, weather permitting, adult \u00a35 return, child \u00a33). Piel Island is also accessible on foot at low tide from Walney Point, but be warned: it\u2019s risky as swift tides can leave you stranded.</p> <p><strong>Stay</strong><strong> </strong><a href=\"http://gibfarm.weebly.com/\" title=\"\">Gibraltar Farm campsite</a> (from \u00a314 per tent) in Silverdale is a working farm in the <a href=\"https://www.arnsidesilverdaleaonb.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Arnside &amp; Silverdale</a><a href=\"https://www.arnsidesilverdaleaonb.org.uk/\" title=\"\"> AONB</a>, with views of Morecambe Bay and its own ancient woodland.

It still has its original pier and lift, a funicular railway that takes passengers from the clifftop town down to the massive, sandy beach.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"225bb9953eefa52a149dfb803829d14990ad9ca2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/225bb9953eefa52a149dfb803829d14990ad9ca2/0_8_1165_756/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Saltburn map\" width=\"1000\" height=\"649\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Day one</strong> Step into the imagination of Henry Pease, a Victorian Quaker and industrialist, who literally dreamt up Saltburn in 1858: a celestial vision prompted him to create a town on the edge of a cliff and turn its glen into pleasure grounds. The result is a dignified town with substantial houses overlooking the beach, streets named after jewels (Pearl Street, Ruby Street, Emerald Street) and a very long pier (see below). It also has a variety of independent shops \u2013 check out <a href=\"https://www.chocolinissaltburn.com/\" title=\"\">Choc</a><a href=\"https://www.chocolinissaltburn.com/\" title=\"\">olini\u2019s</a> for handmade chocolates, and <a href=\"https://www.lilliandaph.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Lillian Daph</a> for Scandi-style homeware. Then promenade through the Valley Gardens, whose winding paths cross a stream, go through woodland, and pass formal gardens and a colonnaded gazebo.</p> <p><strong>Day two</strong> Plummet to the beach from the town in the Victorian, water-powered lift. The cliff lift deposits passengers at the entrance of the 200-metre-long pier, which extends across the wind-blown sand at low tide and over rolling waves at high. It has absolutely nothing on it except dog walkers and the occasional seabird \u2013 a place to go to clear the head and gulp salty air. The beach is a well-regarded surf spot, and although the sea can get lively, there are good beginner\u2019s waves on either side of the pier. <a href=\"http://www.saltburn-surf.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Saltburn Surf School</a> has been teaching folk to surf here for over 30 years and offers private lessons (\u00a350 an hour for one person, \u00a360 for two).</p> <p><strong>Day three</strong> Hunt for fossils among the rocks and shingle on the beach. The entire coast between Saltburn and Scarborough is the stuff of geography field trips, and packed with Jurassic geological interest. Saltburn beach is backed by the sheer rock of Huntcliff, whose erosion has revealed ammonites, crinoids and belemnites, and fossilised wood. Staithes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/jan/27/great-country-walks-whitby-north-yorkshire\" title=\"\">Robin Hood\u2019s Bay</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/aug/21/britishidentity.travel\" title=\"\">Runswick Bay</a> are all good fossil-hunting grounds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ed418041459c956f1010c53767a87e72f2802c48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed418041459c956f1010c53767a87e72f2802c48/0_0_7360_4912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The venerable Saltburn Cliff Lift.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The venerable Saltburn Cliff Lift.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: stevegeer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Day four</strong> Spend a few hours in the village of Sandsend, a 30-minute drive along the coast. There is not a whole heap to do here except enjoy its massive (four mile) sandy beach and look around its well-scrubbed village: stone cottages with red roofs, some of which are holiday accommodation, sit in front of immaculate lawns beside a stream that rushes towards the sea. A sprinkle of shops includes a good general store and cafe. Eat well for a reasonable price at <a href=\"http://www.bridgecottagebistro.com/\" title=\"\">the Bridge Cottage Bistro</a>, which serves an imaginative menu including many dishes involving locally caught fish. Alternatively, plump for a Whitby crab sandwich on the deck of the <a href=\"http://sandsidecafe.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Sandside Cafe</a>, inches from the beach.</p> <p><strong>Day five</strong> Visit Staithes to see why it has inspired so many artists, past and present. Park at the top of the town and walk down its steep main street to the harbour, wandering into intriguing-looking alleys along the way. Call in at <a href=\"https://en-gb.facebook.com/pages/category/Bed-and-Breakfast/Dottys-Tearoom-Vintage-Shop-and-Boutique-BB-240141299413217/\" title=\"\">Dotty\u2019s Vintage Tearoom</a> for a buttered tea cake and a pot of tea among vintage collectibles. The <a href=\"http://www.codandlobster.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Cod and Lobster Inn</a> on the harbour wall is as close as you could get to the sea: waves lash against its front door at high tide.

The fragile, shifting bar of pebbles, dunes, reeds, saltmarsh and brackish lagoons is populated by avocets, redshank, oystercatchers, brown hares and Chinese water deer among many other species. Barn owls also nest in several of the buildings built from 1913-1987, when Orford Ness was used as a military test site. Follow waymarked trails to see these and the wildlife.</p> <p><strong>Day three</strong> Motor south along the coast towards the estuary of the River Deben, stopping at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2009/jun/08/shingle-street-walking-guide-suffolk\" title=\"\">Shingle Street</a> \u2013 a lonely row of ex-fishermen\u2019s cottages (now holiday accommodation) evacuated in 1940 under mysterious circumstances.

A spectacular smattering of shattered rocks populated by feral goats (and, in high season, coachloads of tourists), it has inspired Romantic artists (Samuel Palmer), poets (Coleridge, Wordsworth) and novelist RD Blackmore, who set parts of Lorna Doone here. Free guided walks to <a href=\"https://www.southwestcoastpath.org.uk/walksdb/253/\" title=\"\">Hollerday Hill</a> and the Valley of Rocks leave Lynton Town Hall throughout the summer.</p> <p><strong>Day three</strong> Breakfast on shakshuka or eggs benedict at in Lynton. Then head for Lynmouth car park and follow the East Lyn River to <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/watersmeet\" title=\"\">Watersmeet</a> (click on the link for downloadable circular walk). A pleasant two-mile stroll will take you along the river, through a thickly wooded gorge lush with ferns and over bridges to the fairytale-like Watersmeet House. Now a cafe, this ex-fishing lodge sits at the confluence of the East Lyn River and Hoar Oak Water. It is still possible to fish here for salmon, sea trout and brown trout (permits available from Watersmeet House), but most choose to drink tea on the lawn and listen to the river rushing past.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"3c7e39cf5e1b110b95f6d1fbdd4e94205a59fbfc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c7e39cf5e1b110b95f6d1fbdd4e94205a59fbfc/0_395_5923_3554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Valley of the Rocks meets the Bristol Channel near Lynton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Valley of the Rocks meets the Bristol Channel west of Lynton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Craig Joiner/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Day four</strong> Discover a secret(ish) cove. Pack lunch and a book, and scramble down to Wringcliff Bay, following a path from the roundabout in the Valley of Rocks. It takes a bit of effort to reach it \u2013 it is accessible only by a steep footpath, so children should probably avoid it \u2013 but the peacefulness of the place is worth it. The small sandy beach is sheltered by steep cliffs all around and is often deserted. Strong currents mean it is not advisable to swim far out but paddling is highly recommended, as is sitting on a rock and watching the waves. Dogs are allowed.</p> <p><strong>Day five</strong> Explore Combe Martin, a seaside resort that runs ribbon-like along the bottom of a valley with a sheltered (and popular) sandy beach. Pick up some homemade pork pies and pasties from the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/combemartinfarmshop\" title=\"\">Combe Martin Farm Shop</a>, then spend the day rockpooling, or hire a kayak or two from <a href=\"https://www.surfsidekayakhire.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Surfside Kayak Hire</a> and go looking for hidden coves and dolphins.

This four-mile stretch lined with dunes is one of the few sandy beaches along this coastline, and the place to head with a picnic and a beach towel. Even at busy times it\u2019s possible to find a quiet spot to put up a windbreak (advised \u2013 it can get very blowy).

The <a href=\"https://www.avocetgalleryandtea.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Avocet Gallery</a> in Rye Harbour village serves tea and cake (Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays) and showcases (and sells) the work of top-quality local artists, designers and makers.</p> <p><strong>Day five</strong> Go for a beachcomber\u2019s lunch at <a href=\"https://thegallivant.co.uk/\" title=\"\">The Gallivant</a> and tuck into local specialities like saltmarsh lamb and fish from the Hastings fleet (but don\u2019t bring young children \u2013 this hotel/restaurant next to Camber Sands welcomes over-10s only). Head up the hill and enter Winchelsea through one of its medieval gates. Now a quietly delightful town perched high on a ridge a mile inland, it was once an important port and the centre of the wine trade. Book a guided tour around its <a href=\"https://www.winchelsea.com/cellar-tours\" title=\"\">vaulted cellars</a> \u2013 a great rainy-day option \u2013 to get a taste of the town\u2019s medieval past.</p> <p><strong>Stay</strong><strong> </strong><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2xwatdy\" title=\"\">Seashells</a> (sleeps five, from \u00a31,150 to \u00a31,400 a week) is a new, light and airy beach house on Camber Sands with a large gated garden.

The <a href=\"http://www.portlandmuseum.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Portland Museum</a>, a community project founded by birth-control pioneer Marie Stopes and housed in two thatched cottages, is a good place to learn more. It was also the inspiration for the heroine\u2019s cottage in Thomas Hardy\u2019s The Well-Beloved.</p> <p><strong>Day two</strong> Continue explorations by venturing to Portland Bill, which overlooks the roiling waves of Portland Race. This whirl of tides and currents, combined with the Shambles sandbank, is why this rocky promontory has three lighthouses. Climb up the automated candy-striped one to understand the nature of the ship-wrecking waters that surround it. Drop in at the <a href=\"https://www.trinityhouse.co.uk/lighthouse-visitor-centres/portland-bill-lighthouse-visitor-centre\" title=\"\">visitor centre</a>, once the home of the lighthouse keepers, and learn more with the help of interactive displays, then feast on crab sandwiches at <a href=\"http://www.lobsterpotrestaurantportland.co.uk/\" title=\"\">The Lobster Pot</a> next door.</p> <p><strong>Day three</strong> Head along Chesil Beach to Abbotsbury.

Now a visitor attraction, it also has a reputation as a haunted site.

Extending over both sides of a steep valley, the garden is planted with exotic species like Mexican cypress, Japanese loquat and mimosa. Giant gunnera erupt jungle-like in the lower valley. The maze is waist high, so it\u2019s possible to signal for help from others caught in its coils. A stroll to the bottom of the valley leads to Durgan on the water\u2019s edge, where the sandy beach is a good place to sit and eat a sandwich as others go rockpooling.</p> <p><strong>Day three</strong> Paddle through the creeks and coves of the River Helford. Slipping quietly through the water in a small boat is the best way to get to know the river and its forested valleys, witness its wildlife close up, explore the inlets that probe inland, and pull up at one of its quieter beaches and go for a dip. <a href=\"http://www.sailawaystanthony.co.uk/boat-hire/\" title=\"\">St Anthony Sailaway</a> on Gillan Creek at the entrance of the river hires out single and double kayaks and rowing boats for \u00a313-15 an hour. <a href=\"http://korukayaking.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Koru Kayaking</a> runs guided two-hour kayaking adventures for \u00a340, setting off from the private beach at <a href=\"https://www.budockvean.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Budock Vean Hotel</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c6f621c4889acd6db8ce2c6787955f3f94f1e146\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6f621c4889acd6db8ce2c6787955f3f94f1e146/0_46_1300_780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kayaking at Helford village.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Visitors can rent kayaks at Helford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Woolcock/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Day four</strong> Visit convalescing seals in <a href=\"https://www.cornwalls.co.uk/gweek\" title=\"\">Gweek</a>.

In one cottage lived Mary Ann Doonan, captain of the so-called \u201cshe-cruiser\u201d, a ship crewed entirely by women, and something of a local legend.

      "bodyText": "Ll\u0177n peninsula, Gwynedd Parts of the Ll\u0177n peninsula still feel wild and remote \u2013 head to its tip along single-track roads for some splendid isolation and a glimpse into its mythical and holy past. The south coast is more popular with holidaymakers: it\u2019s all about surfing, sailing and sandcastles on its long, sandy beaches. Day one Shop for fruit and veg and all manner of worldly goods at the popular Wednesday market in Pwllheli \u2013 handy if you arrive by train, as it\u2019s right by the station. Alternatively, wait until Sunday when the market stalls sell more local produce. Stop for fish and chips at Allports, where the chips come double-fried to order. Pwllheli boasts sandy beaches, Plas Heli \u2013 the Welsh National Sailing Academy \u2013 and the Hafan Pwllheli Marina, so there are plenty of sailing and yacht-ogling options. Day two See the work of Welsh artists, sculptors and ceramicists at Plas Glyn-y-Weddw in Llanbedrog, a historic arts centre in a fine Victorian Gothic building overlooking Cardigan Bay. Wander around the exhibitions or buy jewellery, textiles and ceramics made by local craftspeople in its shop. Stop for coffee and cake in the glass-roofed tearoom, then walk its network of woodland paths that join the Wales Coast Path on the cliffs above Llanbedrog beach, with its colourful beach huts, shallow water and bucket-and-spade-friendly sand. Day three Surf the waves rolling in from the Irish Sea at one of the long bays on the peninsula\u2019s south coast. Hell\u2019s Mouth (Porth Neigwl), between the headlands of Mynydd Penarfynydd and Mynydd Cilan, has the most reliable surf breaks. Its long, gentle, shelving beach suits swimmers, body boarders and kayakers, too. At the sheltered beach at Porthor, on the north coast, body boarders may even come nose-to-nose with a seal. Porthor has \u201cwhistling sands\u201d \u2013 slide bare feet along the beach and listen to it squeak. Day four Be a pilgrim and walk part of the 135-mile-long North Wales Pilgrim\u2019s Way (Taith Pererin Gogledd Cymru) to the end of the peninsula. Pick it up at the last leg, from Porthor to Aberdaron (about three miles). Then catch a ferry to Ynys Enlli (Bardsey Island) from Porth Meudwy (\u00a332.50 adult, \u00a320 child, book in advance on bardseyboattrips.com), where, according to legend, 20,000 saints are buried. Be warned: the strong tides and currents mean that the crossing can be choppy and infrequent. Day five Walk to the T\u0177 Coch Inn (no cars allowed, park in the National Trust car park a 20-minute walk away), which is right on the beach at the tiny hamlet of Porthdinllaen. One of a string of buildings protected by a headland, with the sea a few feet away, the pub is a perfect lunch stop. Refuel with sandwiches and pasties, then go for a stand-up paddleboarding lesson, running every Thursday and Saturday throughout the summer holidays. Learn about Porthdinllaen\u2019s surprising shipbuilding and fishing past at Caban Griff, the National Trust centre in the village. Stay Bert\u2019s Kitchen Garden (three-nights from \u00a3133 to \u00a3145 per pitch based on four sharing, pre-pitched tents also available) in Trefor is an eco-campsite with 15 pitches, communal campfires, a private shingle beach and a cafe in a converted campervan. Ardnamurchan, Highlands A solitary road alongside Loch Sunart runs through this remote peninsula in the north-west Highlands. Wild, sparsely inhabited and unspoilt, it is the westernmost point of the UK mainland and the place to go for unhurried exploration of beaches, mountains, forest and moorland, taking in wildlife along the way. Day one Gen up on local wildlife at the Ardnamurchan natural history visitor centre. The area is rich in wildlife, including otters, pine martens, golden eagles and wild cats. Some \u2013 pine martens, field voles and swallows \u2013 make their way to the Living Building, built to encourage a variety of creatures to make it their home. Visitors can walk through this turf-roofed timber building to experience simulations of various habitats, including a wild cat den and a wood at night. Its Lochview Tearoom serves full Scottish breakfasts and light lunches, or buy sandwiches and cake to take away. Day two Hire a bike from Sunart Cycles (\u00a320 a day) and either pedal independently or ask for a pre-planned tour. Bikes can be dropped off for no extra charge in the towns of Acharacle and Salen. Cycling on the peninsula itself is restricted mostly to the main road, which can get busy in summer. There are cycle paths on the other side of Loch Sunart in Morvern, however, which include routes through nature reserves and the ancient forest of Ariundle Oakwood. Suitable for hybrid and mountain bikes, there are several challenging off-road tracks. Day three Climb Ben Hiant to get 360-degree views of the peninsula. Not as forbidding as it might sound, this extinct volcano is easy to scale \u2013 it\u2019s a mere 528 metres high and there is a clear path to the top. As you ascend, look out for signs of pine martens and red deer. If visibility is good, you can see the islands of Muck, Eigg and Rum, Mull, Coll and Tiree from the top, as well as the rest of Ardnamurchan spilling out before you. Ben Hiant is loosely translated as Holy or Blessed Mountain, which may be a nod to the ancient burial ground nearby, at the bay of Camas nan Gaell. Day four Otter Adventures can guide you on a variety of kayak and canoe outings on Loch Sunart, including a Sea Kayak and a Family Canoe Adventure. With a guide (and other canoeists), you get to stop off at otherwise inaccessible islands and forests, or light a fire and brew a cup of tea. There may also be seals. Journeys take up most of the day and cost \u00a380 adult, \u00a350 child. Day five Pack provisions and head to Sanna Bay, at the tip of the peninsula, as there is nothing to buy when you arrive. A remote and lovely spot with soft white sand beaches, turquoise seas and flower-rich machair in spring and summer, it is easy to spend hours here doing nothing very much apart from a spot of rockpooling or beachcombing. There are plenty of wildlife-spotting opportunities, too: sand martens nest in the dune cliffs; otters forage along the shore; butterflies feed on wildflowers; you may even spot a white-tailed eagle. Stay Keeper\u2019s West cottage (sleeps four, from \u00a3428 to \u00a3676 a week) sits beneath the Ardnamurchan Lighthouse at the edge of the peninsula. Tir Nan Og (sleeps six, from \u00a3340 to \u00a3640 a week) is a simple whitewashed stone cottage, minutes away from the white sand beach of Sanna Bay. Morecambe Bay, Cumbria/Lancashire The vast, shimmering sands of Morecambe Bay may look beguiling but the quicksand and mudflats are notoriously dangerous. Best to admire these from the shore and explore its estuaries, islands and resorts instead. Day one Stop for coffee at the Ravilious Rotunda Bar at the Midland Hotel \u2013 non-residents are welcome. This art deco smasher, with its curvilinear white facade, has become a destination in its own right. Sit by a window and look out over Morecambe Bay\u2019s seemingly never-ending expanse. On 31 August\u20131 September, Hemingway Designs is holding its annual Vintage By The Sea Festival (free entry) at the hotel. Expect many moustachioed and red-lipsticked retro enthusiasts enjoying the vintage fairground, live music, market and classic cars. Day two Walk south on Morecambe\u2019s promenade to the very end \u2013 about three miles, depending on where you start. This flat and undemanding route, also ideal for cycling, skirts Morecambe Bay. You might see wading birds such as oystercatchers and turnstone digging around in the mudflats for food \u2013 especially at low tide when they are driven closer to the promenade. You\u2019ll definitely see the wonderful statue of Eric Morecambe in one of his characteristic poses with a pair of binoculars around his neck (he was a keen ornithologist). At the prom\u2019s end, walk up to Heysham Head and the ruined eighth-century St Patrick\u2019s Chapel (rumoured to be where St Patrick came ashore following a shipwreck), which has great views of the bay. And look out for the body-shaped pre-Norman graves, carved out of rock and facing towards the ocean. Day three Fortify yourself with breakfast at View Caf\u00e9, decorated with vinyl and music memorabilia. A designated Spam Menu includes Spam fritters, but there are other, more contemporary \u2013 and more appealing \u2013 options. Hire a bike at Morecambe station from Bike and Go (\u00a310 for an annual subscription, then \u00a33.80 a day), then join the Bay Cycle Way and pedal part of the route out of Morecambe, heading north along the coast. (Its entire length, from Walney Island in Barrow-in-Furness to Glasson Dock in Lancaster, is 81 miles.) Plotted by Sustrans, it takes cyclists on traffic-free paths and quiet lanes wherever possible (get a map, which includes several day rides at sustrans.org.uk, \u00a313). Day four Catch the train from Lancaster to Grange-over-Sands (or from Morecambe and change) and travel over the 505-metre-long viaduct that snakes across the estuary of the River Kent. On arrival, check out the station, with its elegant red-and-green wrought iron pillars supporting glass platform canopies. Grange-over-Sands was a popular resort during the Victorian sea-bathing craze and still has a rarefied air. Its sheltered position means it also has many subtropical plants along the promenade and in the Ornamental Gardens. It\u2019s not the place to swim, however: at extreme low tides, the sea can be around 10 miles away. Day five Have an audience with the King of Piel Island. This 50-acre kingdom off the tip of Furness peninsula, Barrow-in-Furness, comprises a ruined 14th-century castle, a row of houses and the Ship Inn. The landlord, Steve Chattaway, is also the king \u2013 a title he inherited with ownership of the pub. You can camp here (\u00a35 per tent, must be pre-booked) and the pub also serves food, but most visitors come for the day. In high season (April-Sept), catch the ferry from Roa Island, which is connected to the mainland by an isthmus (daily 11am-4.30pm, weather permitting, adult \u00a35 return, child \u00a33). Piel Island is also accessible on foot at low tide from Walney Point, but be warned: it\u2019s risky as swift tides can leave you stranded. Stay Gibraltar Farm campsite (from \u00a314 per tent) in Silverdale is a working farm in the Arnside &amp; Silverdale AONB, with views of Morecambe Bay and its own ancient woodland. For groups, camping in a designated area in the woods is \u00a3160 a night for up to 10 tents. Wolf House Cottages are two self-catering properties near the village of Silverdale: the Coach House sleeps six, from \u00a3575 to \u00a3795 a week; the Old Cottage sleeps four adults and two children, from \u00a3495 to \u00a3580 a week. Saltburn-by-the-sea, North Yorkshire Often overlooked in favour of its neighbour, the quainter fishing village of Staithes, or the mighty harbour that is Whitby, Saltburn-by-the-Sea is a Victorian seaside resort that remains steadfastly unchanged. It still has its original pier and lift, a funicular railway that takes passengers from the clifftop town down to the massive, sandy beach. Day one Step into the imagination of Henry Pease, a Victorian Quaker and industrialist, who literally dreamt up Saltburn in 1858: a celestial vision prompted him to create a town on the edge of a cliff and turn its glen into pleasure grounds. The result is a dignified town with substantial houses overlooking the beach, streets named after jewels (Pearl Street, Ruby Street, Emerald Street) and a very long pier (see below). It also has a variety of independent shops \u2013 check out Chocolini\u2019s for handmade chocolates, and Lillian Daph for Scandi-style homeware. Then promenade through the Valley Gardens, whose winding paths cross a stream, go through woodland, and pass formal gardens and a colonnaded gazebo. Day two Plummet to the beach from the town in the Victorian, water-powered lift. The cliff lift deposits passengers at the entrance of the 200-metre-long pier, which extends across the wind-blown sand at low tide and over rolling waves at high. It has absolutely nothing on it except dog walkers and the occasional seabird \u2013 a place to go to clear the head and gulp salty air. The beach is a well-regarded surf spot, and although the sea can get lively, there are good beginner\u2019s waves on either side of the pier. Saltburn Surf School has been teaching folk to surf here for over 30 years and offers private lessons (\u00a350 an hour for one person, \u00a360 for two). Day three Hunt for fossils among the rocks and shingle on the beach. The entire coast between Saltburn and Scarborough is the stuff of geography field trips, and packed with Jurassic geological interest. Saltburn beach is backed by the sheer rock of Huntcliff, whose erosion has revealed ammonites, crinoids and belemnites, and fossilised wood. Staithes, Robin Hood\u2019s Bay and Runswick Bay are all good fossil-hunting grounds. Day four Spend a few hours in the village of Sandsend, a 30-minute drive along the coast. There is not a whole heap to do here except enjoy its massive (four mile) sandy beach and look around its well-scrubbed village: stone cottages with red roofs, some of which are holiday accommodation, sit in front of immaculate lawns beside a stream that rushes towards the sea. A sprinkle of shops includes a good general store and cafe. Eat well for a reasonable price at the Bridge Cottage Bistro, which serves an imaginative menu including many dishes involving locally caught fish. Alternatively, plump for a Whitby crab sandwich on the deck of the Sandside Cafe, inches from the beach. Day five Visit Staithes to see why it has inspired so many artists, past and present. Park at the top of the town and walk down its steep main street to the harbour, wandering into intriguing-looking alleys along the way. Call in at Dotty\u2019s Vintage Tearoom for a buttered tea cake and a pot of tea among vintage collectibles. The Cod and Lobster Inn on the harbour wall is as close as you could get to the sea: waves lash against its front door at high tide. At low tide, the rocky shoreline platform outside is exposed \u2013 good rockpooling territory. Stay Coastguard Cottage (sleeps four, from \u00a3320 to \u00a3650 a week) is one of a row of houses perched above Saltburn beach on the Cleveland Way. The Spa Hotel (doubles from \u00a3109 a night B&amp;B) sits above the beach, has views of the sea and cliffs, and offers Surf and Stay packages which include lessons. Orford, Suffolk Traces of Orford\u2019s past can be detected in its ex-fishermen\u2019s cottages, busy quayside and hulks of old boats sinking into the mud. This pretty village is a mixture of the delightful and the beguilingly sinister: the former military testing site and shingle bank, Orford Ness, stretch out alongside. Day one Pick up breakfast from Pump Street Bakery in Market Square: all of its naturally leavened bread and pastries are made in the village, and it makes its own small-batch chocolate. Nip into Pinney\u2019s for picnic supplies \u2013 the shop beside its smokehouse sells its own smoked fish, and wet fish caught daily on its boats. Orford General Store is an excellent village shop selling local cheese, fruit and veg, and just about everything else you may need, including maps. Day two Catch the little ferry from Orford quay to Orford Ness, a strange and rare shingle spit running parallel to the coast. The fragile, shifting bar of pebbles, dunes, reeds, saltmarsh and brackish lagoons is populated by avocets, redshank, oystercatchers, brown hares and Chinese water deer among many other species. Barn owls also nest in several of the buildings built from 1913-1987, when Orford Ness was used as a military test site. Follow waymarked trails to see these and the wildlife. Day three Motor south along the coast towards the estuary of the River Deben, stopping at Shingle Street \u2013 a lonely row of ex-fishermen\u2019s cottages (now holiday accommodation) evacuated in 1940 under mysterious circumstances. Sit on the beach, soak up the atmosphere, or go for a swim. Stop for lunch at The Ramsholt Arms (the lunch menu includes handmade faggots, local ham steak and veggie options), and watch yachts sail by from its deck overlooking the estuary. Day four Tune into your animal spirit with a goat yoga session \u2013 the goats wander among you \u2013 at Skylark Farm (\u00a315, book in advance) in Bawdsey, held on Sunday mornings and Tuesday evenings. Goat petting/milking sessions can also be arranged as a child-friendly option. Drive on to Felixstowe, and either marvel at the Tetris-like dexterity of the crane drivers at the container port, stroll through the recently restored Seafront Gardens, or swim in the sea (rated \u201cexcellent\u201d water quality by the Environment Agency). The beach is a mixture of shingle and sand. Day five Climb aboard the Lady Florence, a lovely wooden second world war supply ship, for a lunch or supper cruise. Departing from Orford Quay, the three-hour trip along the rivers Alde and Ore goes past Orford Ness to Shingle Street and the North Sea, before returning. It also circumnavigates Havergate Island bird sanctuary. Alternatively, a breakfast cruise will take you upstream to Aldeburgh and back, as you eat hot muffins on deck. Twelve passengers per cruise, \u00a322.50pp, meal extra, rivercruiserestaurants.co.uk. Stay Daphne Cottage (sleeps two, from \u00a3485 to \u00a3795 a week) is a Grade II-listed Victorian cottage with a small garden at the front and a patio at the back. Lynton and Lynmouth, Exmoor coast, Devon The twin towns of Lynton and Lynmouth peer over the sea from the precipitous cliffs of the north Devon coast. Exmoor is close by, to the south, and the cliffs and gorges are threaded with numerous walking trails, rocky coves and hidden beaches. Day one Ascend from the Esplanade at Lynmouth to its sister town of Lynton on the Cliff Railway. There\u2019s no better way to get up a cliff than sitting in a bottle-green carriage of a Victorian funicular railway as it steadily makes its way to the top. Two carriages work in tandem \u2013 one goes up as the other goes down \u2013 propelled by the gravity pull of water discharged from tanks fitted to each. At the top, a giant scone awaits in the cafe as part of a Devon cream tea, plus views of the coast curling out of sight. Day two Walk to the Valley of Rocks. A 20-minute walk from the Cliff Railway along clearly marked paths will take you to a U-shaped dry valley that runs parallel to the coast. A spectacular smattering of shattered rocks populated by feral goats (and, in high season, coachloads of tourists), it has inspired Romantic artists (Samuel Palmer), poets (Coleridge, Wordsworth) and novelist RD Blackmore, who set parts of Lorna Doone here. Free guided walks to Hollerday Hill and the Valley of Rocks leave Lynton Town Hall throughout the summer. Day three Breakfast on shakshuka or eggs benedict at in Lynton. Then head for Lynmouth car park and follow the East Lyn River to Watersmeet (click on the link for downloadable circular walk). A pleasant two-mile stroll will take you along the river, through a thickly wooded gorge lush with ferns and over bridges to the fairytale-like Watersmeet House. Now a cafe, this ex-fishing lodge sits at the confluence of the East Lyn River and Hoar Oak Water. It is still possible to fish here for salmon, sea trout and brown trout (permits available from Watersmeet House), but most choose to drink tea on the lawn and listen to the river rushing past. Day four Discover a secret(ish) cove. Pack lunch and a book, and scramble down to Wringcliff Bay, following a path from the roundabout in the Valley of Rocks. It takes a bit of effort to reach it \u2013 it is accessible only by a steep footpath, so children should probably avoid it \u2013 but the peacefulness of the place is worth it. The small sandy beach is sheltered by steep cliffs all around and is often deserted. Strong currents mean it is not advisable to swim far out but paddling is highly recommended, as is sitting on a rock and watching the waves. Dogs are allowed. Day five Explore Combe Martin, a seaside resort that runs ribbon-like along the bottom of a valley with a sheltered (and popular) sandy beach. Pick up some homemade pork pies and pasties from the Combe Martin Farm Shop, then spend the day rockpooling, or hire a kayak or two from Surfside Kayak Hire and go looking for hidden coves and dolphins. Alternatively, take the South West Coast Path out of town and walk to the vertiginous Hangman Hills, the highest sea cliffs in England. (Combe Martin is also where the Hunting of the Earl of Rone \u2013 a custom involving villagers dressing up and chasing the Earl of Rone through the town \u2013 takes place every May.) Stay Bayview Tower in Lynton (sleeps four, from \u00a3560 to \u00a32,129 a week,) is a rather grand apartment (with four-poster bed) looking over Lynmouth Bay. Countisbury Hill Cottage (sleeps four, from \u00a3309 to \u00a3819 for two nights/\u00a3559 to \u00a31,479 a week, dogs welcome) is a stone cottage with an enclosed garden in a remote hamlet near Lynton. Foreland Bothy (sleeps four, from \u00a321 to \u00a327 a night) is a simple, windowless room with wooden platforms for beds (no mattresses or other amenities), right on the South West Coast Path near Lynton. Winchelsea Beach, East Sussex Tucked behind a shingle ridge, a stroll from the soft sands of Camber and three miles from the cobbled lanes of Rye, the village of Winchelsea Beach still feels undiscovered. Pre-war railway-carriage homes sit beside wooden beach huts, bungalows and smart, contemporary dwellings, giving the area an appealingly ramshackle and curious air. Day one Stock up on supplies for the week at Salts Farm Shop just north-west of Rye, which sells Kentish Mayde pies, free-range eggs from a farm in Battle, and beer from Romney Marsh Brewery. Head up the hill to the Winchelsea Farm Kitchen for good quality meat, wine and other deli delights. On the way back, drop in at The Clam, a new Camber cafe serving all-day brunch \u2013 tasty sourdough toast toppings include tahini, blood orange, pistachio and honey \u2013 and steak tacos. Day two Stay local and make the most of Camber Sands on your doorstep. This four-mile stretch lined with dunes is one of the few sandy beaches along this coastline, and the place to head with a picnic and a beach towel. Even at busy times it\u2019s possible to find a quiet spot to put up a windbreak (advised \u2013 it can get very blowy). The Kitesurf Centre and Rye Water Sports offer kitesurfing and paddleboarding lessons. Day three Head out to Romney Marsh and explore its 14 medieval churches, rising in splendid isolation from the flat land. Built by lords of the manor to serve now-vanished communities, and also as a display of wealth, most are open to visitors. Don\u2019t miss St Thomas \u00e0 Becket at Fairfield, which has appeared in various TV programmes, including Great Expectations. End the day in an open-sided carriage of a one-third size steam locomotive on the Romney, Hythe &amp; Dymchurch Railway. Buy a return ticket and hop on at nearby Dungeness for a sweet little chug along the coast to Hythe and back (rover ticket \u00a318.60 adult, \u00a39.30 child, less for shorter journeys). Day four Walk to Rye Harbour Nature Reserve \u2013 a land of gravel pits, lagoons, marsh and shingle. An important conservation site, you could spot avocets nesting in the saltmarsh or marsh harriers hunting in the reedbeds. Walk to a bird hide along wooden boardwalks (look out for yellow horned-poppies, sea kale and sea campion in the shingle along the way) and wait. The Avocet Gallery in Rye Harbour village serves tea and cake (Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays) and showcases (and sells) the work of top-quality local artists, designers and makers. Day five Go for a beachcomber\u2019s lunch at The Gallivant and tuck into local specialities like saltmarsh lamb and fish from the Hastings fleet (but don\u2019t bring young children \u2013 this hotel/restaurant next to Camber Sands welcomes over-10s only). Head up the hill and enter Winchelsea through one of its medieval gates. Now a quietly delightful town perched high on a ridge a mile inland, it was once an important port and the centre of the wine trade. Book a guided tour around its vaulted cellars \u2013 a great rainy-day option \u2013 to get a taste of the town\u2019s medieval past. Stay Seashells (sleeps five, from \u00a31,150 to \u00a31,400 a week) is a new, light and airy beach house on Camber Sands with a large gated garden. The same owner rents out Pebbles Beach House (sleeps five, \u00a31,299 a week high season, \u00a3165 a night low season \u2013 two-night minimum), an airy, shabby-chic wooden bolthole on the shingle at Winchelsea Beach. Isle of Portland, Weymouth and Chesil Beach, Dorset The Isle of Portland isn\u2019t actually an island \u2013 it\u2019s a chunk of limestone tethered to the mainland by the shingle tombolo that is Chesil Beach \u2013 but it still feels apart from the mainland, and the rest of the Jurassic Coast. Day one Take a look around the scattered settlements of Portland, keeping an eye open for buildings built from Portland stone. Drop by Tout Quarry nature reserve and sculpture park, where much of the stone was quarried (and ended up in Buckingham Palace and St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, among other places) and which now has 60 hidden sculptures to discover along meandering paths. The Portland Museum, a community project founded by birth-control pioneer Marie Stopes and housed in two thatched cottages, is a good place to learn more. It was also the inspiration for the heroine\u2019s cottage in Thomas Hardy\u2019s The Well-Beloved. Day two Continue explorations by venturing to Portland Bill, which overlooks the roiling waves of Portland Race. This whirl of tides and currents, combined with the Shambles sandbank, is why this rocky promontory has three lighthouses. Climb up the automated candy-striped one to understand the nature of the ship-wrecking waters that surround it. Drop in at the visitor centre, once the home of the lighthouse keepers, and learn more with the help of interactive displays, then feast on crab sandwiches at The Lobster Pot next door. Day three Head along Chesil Beach to Abbotsbury. Chesil Beach runs beyond the pretty, thatched village of Abbotsbury, parallel to the coast to West Bay, framing Fleet Lagoon. This brackish lake is home to the 600 mute swans at the Swannery at Abbotsbury. Help to feed them at noon and 4pm daily, then sample Abbotsbury mackerel and other sustainably sourced fish at the Taste Caf\u00e9 in the Chesil Beach visitor centre, which has views over the lagoon and beach. Day four Get out on to the water at Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy in Portland Harbour, which hosted the sailing events at the 2012 Olympics and is now a centre of sailing excellence. The RYA-accredited Andrew Simpson Centre offers sailing taster sessions for \u00a320 an hour. There are also plenty of other opportunities locally to snorkel, canoe, swim, scuba dive to shipwrecks, and fish. Head into Weymouth and refuel with fish and chips at The Old Harbour restaurant, followed by a game of whack-a-mole in the amusement arcade on the beach for the full-on seaside experience. Day five Visit the labyrinthine Northe Fort at the mouth of Weymouth harbour, which was built in 1872 to defend the Portland naval base from Napoleon III. Now a visitor attraction, it also has a reputation as a haunted site. Alternatively, hop aboard a wooden second world war naval boat and let a bewhiskered skipper take you on a 1\u00bd-hour trip along the Jurassic Coast. Boats leave from Weymouth harbour (\u00a314). On the way back to base, stop for a drink at the Cove House Inn \u2013 sit outside and enjoy the sight of Chesil Beach stretching out before you. Stay The Old Higher Lighthouse cottages (each sleeps four, from \u00a3450 to \u00a31,000 a week) on Portland Bill, have the sea views you\u2019d expect from a lighthouse plus shared use of a pool and hot tub. Alternatively, 50 Ocean Views (sleeps four, from \u00a3490 to \u00a31,154 a week) is a smart contemporary apartment with a private terrace and sea views. Helford estuary, Cornwall The cool, wooded creeks and tucked-away coves of the River Helford are a welcome escape from the busy beaches and bustle of nearby Falmouth. It\u2019s all about the life aquatic here, whether it\u2019s watching small boats and yachts from the footpath or the terrace of an agreeable pub, or taking to the water in a kayak. Day one Sink a pint on the terrace outside The Ferryboat Inn at Helford Passage. This popular pub sits beside the river above a beach, and is a good viewpoint for gazing over the estuary and watching small boats bob about. The menu changes daily and includes pub food classics and inventive fish dishes (mackerel tacos, seabass linguine). It\u2019s a prime position for watching the Helford Passage Regatta (10 August) and is also the place to catch the ferry across the river to Helford, see below, and to pick up the South West Coast Path. Day two The lush vegetation and the cherry laurel maze at the National Trust\u2019s Glendurgan Garden near the village of Durgan is a wonderful place to get lost in. Extending over both sides of a steep valley, the garden is planted with exotic species like Mexican cypress, Japanese loquat and mimosa. Giant gunnera erupt jungle-like in the lower valley. The maze is waist high, so it\u2019s possible to signal for help from others caught in its coils. A stroll to the bottom of the valley leads to Durgan on the water\u2019s edge, where the sandy beach is a good place to sit and eat a sandwich as others go rockpooling. Day three Paddle through the creeks and coves of the River Helford. Slipping quietly through the water in a small boat is the best way to get to know the river and its forested valleys, witness its wildlife close up, explore the inlets that probe inland, and pull up at one of its quieter beaches and go for a dip. St Anthony Sailaway on Gillan Creek at the entrance of the river hires out single and double kayaks and rowing boats for \u00a313-15 an hour. Koru Kayaking runs guided two-hour kayaking adventures for \u00a340, setting off from the private beach at Budock Vean Hotel. Day four Visit convalescing seals in Gweek. Started when Ken Jones rescued a baby seal washed up on the beach in 1958, the Cornish Seal Sanctuary now has five pools and a hospital where it cares for orphaned, sick or injured animals \u2013 not just seals: otters, goats, ponies and penguins are all looked after here. Once recovered, most seals are returned to the sea: those that wouldn\u2019t survive, stay on as \u201cguests\u201d. Day five The shortish (three-mile) circular walk from Helford village and taking in Frenchman\u2019s Creek is idyllic. Walkers will see the little ferry sailing to Helford Passage on the other side of the river with its cargo of hikers and holidaymakers (no cars). The path then passes the Shipwright\u2019s Arms (where children can crab off the slip, and which holds an annual regatta), to the tiny chapel of St Francis at Pengwedhen, past Kestle Barton, the new Rural Centre for Contemporary Arts in a restored ancient farmstead, and along the wooded and fern-lined Frenchman\u2019s Creek, made famous by Daphne du Maurier\u2019s classic book, before returning to Helford. It\u2019s worth tarrying to wander around the village\u2019s thatched cottages and boathouses. Stay Kestle Cottage (sleeps four, from \u00a3395 to \u00a31,295 a week), near Frenchman\u2019s Creek, is one of several holiday homes in recently converted farm buildings. Creek View (sleeps four, \u00a3317 to \u00a3939 a week) is an apartment above Helford Village Stores with a gorgeous view over the estuary. Bosvathick House B&amp;B (doubles \u00a3110 a night, singles \u00a370)is a grand private home in Constantine, a short drive from the estuary, with stately rooms, a laurel maze and rolling grounds (gardens open in peak season). Ards peninsula, County Down The Ards peninsula wraps around Strangford Lough enclosing it from the Irish Sea. The shoreline is never far away, be it the sandy beaches of the east coast, or the shingle banks surrounding the Lough. Day one Stock up on locally produced food and craft at the monthly market, held in Portaferry\u2019s restored market house (first Saturday of the month, 10am-1.30pm). Portaferry sits at the southern end of the peninsula near the Narrows \u2013 the turbulent channel linking Strangford Lough to the Irish Sea \u2013 and is where to catch the ferry to the other side of the Lough. Sit outside the Portaferry Hotel with a coffee and wait for the ferry to arrive, or duck inside to eat seafood dishes, including bouillabaisse and lobster. Day two Make your way three miles up the road from Portaferry to Kearney, a former fishing village restored in vernacular style by the National Trust. Now fully occupied, the simple whitewashed cottages tucked between drumlins (hillocks) and the sea, present a sanitised but appealing impression of what life was like in a 19th-century fishing village. In one cottage lived Mary Ann Doonan, captain of the so-called \u201cshe-cruiser\u201d, a ship crewed entirely by women, and something of a local legend. The sandy beach of Knockinelder is close by and is a lovely spot for a dip. Day three Hire a canoe and explore one of Strangford Lough\u2019s 100-plus islands, many of them rich in seabirds and other wildlife; you may even spot seals and otters as you go. Outdoor Recreation NI, which manages and promotes outdoor activities in Northern Ireland, has devised a series of canoe trails, which can be found, along with a list of canoe providers, at canoeni.com. One canoe trail leads to Salt Island, where you can stay overnight in a bothy \u2013 it has a woodburner and a flushing toilet but no cooker (sleeps 10, \u00a310pp sharing, \u00a380 for exclusive use). Day four Drive around to the other side of Strangford Lough to the Castle Epsie Wetland Centre (which is just 12 miles south-east of Belfast). Blending with the shoreline of the Lough, its 25 hectares of tidal lagoons, salt marsh, woodland and reed beds are home to countless birds, bats and insects, and a stopping-off point for migrating brent geese. Watch the avian comings and goings from one of the hides, or walk among ducks, ducklings and geese in the duckery. On the way back, stop off at Daft Eddy\u2019s, a smart modern restaurant by the side of the Lough, for Portavogie scampi and a pint of Guinness. Day five Visit Grey Abbey House and Gardens in Newtownards to inspect a fine example of a big old Irish Georgian house. Located on the side of the Lough, the grounds have a walled and vegetable gardens, and two orchards of Victorian fruit trees and Irish apple trees. The expansive estate includes a lake and ancient woodland inhabited by red squirrels. Close by are the ruins of a Norman Cistercian priory, dissolved by Henry VIII. Up the road is Harrisons of Grey Abbey, a nursery, farm shop and popular restaurant. Stay Cowey Cottage (sleeps four, from \u00a3395 to \u00a3550 a week) in Newtownards is a stone cottage with a woodburner, comfortable leather sofas and a flagstone floor, deep in rolling farmland but a short drive to the Lough. Castle Ward Caravan Park, in the grounds of the Castle Ward estate on the shores of Strangford Lough, has 10 pitches for tents (from \u00a318.50), plus wooden camping pods (sleep two to five, from \u00a342 to \u00a367), and 25 hard stands for caravans/motor homes (from \u00a322). For caravans and tents, add \u00a32 per additional adult, \u00a31 per child and \u00a32 per additional car. Looking for a holiday with a difference?

The budget cuts would be a disaster for US climate research. The University of Alaska System is the primary academic institution for Arctic research in the US and \u201cevery climate change researcher, educator, scientist and student in the lower 48 whose work touches the American Arctic\u201d relies on the center\u2019s work, Victoria Herrmann, the president of the Arctic Institute, <a href=\"https://earther.gizmodo.com/the-alaska-governor-s-proposed-budget-cuts-would-be-a-d-1836046296\">told Gizmodo</a>. \u201cIf the UA [University of Alaska] is defunded at the current rate, Arctic research in every corner of America will suffer.\u201d She added, lest we forget, that \u201cwhat happens in the Arctic doesn\u2019t stay in the Arctic\u201d.</p> <p>Bluntly stated, the idea of an annual payout is to bring people to Alaska and to keep them there.

Alaska Natives constitute the majority of students in some of the regional campuses of the University of Alaska Fairbanks, such as Kuskokwim (70%) and Bristol Bay (62%). Many will be unable to attend university if their regional campus is closed (or certain programs are closed). But the impact goes well beyond regional economics and even the state of Alaska. The budget cuts would be a disaster for US climate research. The University of Alaska System is the primary academic institution for Arctic research in the US and \u201cevery climate change researcher, educator, scientist and student in the lower 48 whose work touches the American Arctic\u201d relies on the center\u2019s work, Victoria Herrmann, the president of the Arctic Institute, told Gizmodo. \u201cIf the UA [University of Alaska] is defunded at the current rate, Arctic research in every corner of America will suffer.\u201d She added, lest we forget, that \u201cwhat happens in the Arctic doesn\u2019t stay in the Arctic\u201d. Bluntly stated, the idea of an annual payout is to bring people to Alaska and to keep them there. It is unclear whether it achieves that. What we do know is that the University of Alaska system retains many of the most mobile, higher-educated workers that the state economy depends on. Research has found that 68% of two-year graduates and 42% of four-year graduates remain in the state. How many young Alaskans, if forced to leave the state to find (better) higher education elsewhere, will return to Alaska after finishing their degree? Dunleavy\u2019s draconic budget will be devastating for the state of Alaska and will have negative consequences for the rest of the US and the world. It is up to the Alaska legislature to stand up to Dunleavy\u2019s short-term opportunism and veto his budget. Cas Mudde is a Guardian US columnist and the Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor in the School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Georgia This article was amended on July 16 2019 to clarify that state funding of the university was cut by 41%. An earlier version stated that this was the size of the cut to the university\u2019s overall budget, which is incorrect.",

The women\u2019s game is known for its close friendships, and the photographs highlight these bonds, formed both at club and international level. \u201cIn the men\u2019s game, I don\u2019t think there is that same sense of camaraderie,\u201d Barrett says. \u201cYou\u2019re not best mates.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"831ca43f1dc334797f0f89d13b2b93a17404cf02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/831ca43f1dc334797f0f89d13b2b93a17404cf02/0_0_2740_1830/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England and Manchester City forward Ellen White, taken by her then Birmingham City FC teammate Marisa Ewers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England and Manchester City forward Ellen White, taken by her then Birmingham City teammate Marisa Ewers: \u2018Ellen was interviewed after our last home game at St Andrews.

      "bodyText": "Embarrassingly, there were tears running down my face when I stepped into the roaring stands for England\u2019s first match of the 2019 Women\u2019s World Cup in Nice. Football is just a game, but for women players it is hard to disengage from the sexism and stresses that accompany it. Watching Nikita Parris flowing down the wing, smashing in a penalty at the 14th minute, then Ellen White\u2019s initial offside goal being rewarded by the real deal: I know how hard their predecessors had fought for these moments of unadulterated joy. The frenzy of press and promotion in the lead up to this year\u2019s tournament was unprecedented. But Goal Click, a five-year-old social enterprise that sends disposable cameras to footballers around the world and then publishes the results online (alongside candid interviews), has been well ahead of the strike. Before the tournament, their cameras ended up in the hands of 18 international players, including England right-back Lucy Bronze, Jamaica defender Lauren Silver and USA midfielder Sam Mewis. All have captured the beautiful game in a singularly personal way. Above: USA midfielder Rose Lavelle (on left) and forward/co-captain Alex Morgan in an ice bath, taken by teammate Sam Mewis: \u2018I tried to show realistic parts of our lives. The bathrooms (not glamorous), the ice bath (cold as F), the bus (constantly travelling), Facetiming my husband\u2019 Left: Selfie with Lyon Champions League shirt, taken by England star Lucy Bronze: \u2018It\u2019s match day against Chelsea, and I\u2019m holding my shirt with its five badge on the arm because Lyon have won five Champions Leagues. It\u2019s a cool reminder of the history that comes with playing for a club like mine\u2019 Right: Lucy Bronze\u2019s image of fellow Lyon players celebrating reaching the Champions League final, including (from left) Delphine Cascarino, Eug\u00e9nie Le Sommer and Wendie Renard, who all play for the French national team From the start, we have tried to represent the full diversity of the game,\u201d says Goal Click co-founder Matthew Barrett. \u201cOur second story was about an Indian girls football team in Mumbai.\u201d Other projects have included the Homeless World Cup and the Single Leg Amputee Sports Association in Sierra Leone. \u201cI have more interest in women\u2019s football stories off the pitch because, quite frankly, they are deeper and more meaningful,\u201d adds Barrett. The women\u2019s game is known for its close friendships, and the photographs highlight these bonds, formed both at club and international level. \u201cIn the men\u2019s game, I don\u2019t think there is that same sense of camaraderie,\u201d Barrett says. \u201cYou\u2019re not best mates.\u201d Above: England and Manchester City forward Ellen White, taken by her then Birmingham City teammate Marisa Ewers: \u2018Ellen was interviewed after our last home game at St Andrews. She\u2019s been outrageous during her time at the Blues \u2013 top goalscorer in every season\u2019 The photographs give an intimate view of life beyond the match-day theatrics. Chelsea players pile on to charter planes (the women\u2019s game can\u2019t afford private jets just yet); a Norwegian team play in the snow; and Australians warm up on the beach. There are messy boot rooms, selfies and \u201cleg-fies\u201d by stars such as France\u2019s Eug\u00e9nie Le Sommer. Mewis\u2019s image of USA teammates Rose Lavelle and Alex Morgan staring up at the camera as they kneel in an ice water bath is a particular highlight for Barrett: \u201cIt really stood out as a photo that could only have been taken by a teammate.\u201d Left: Arsenal\u2019s boot room, taken by Beth Mead, forward for England and Arsenal: \u2018This is a little shed we keep our boots in. It shows how humble we are in the women\u2019s game. We don\u2019t need big flash things\u2019 Right: Hedvig Lindahl, goalkeeper for Sweden and Chelsea, snaps her youngest son, Nathan: \u2018My little boy stepping on to a plane [to a game]. Family is affected by our choice of career. The biggest sacrifice I\u2019ve made is the relationships you have to say no to, like spending time with my 96-year-old grandmother\u2019 With Thailand striker Miranda Nild as one of his contributors, her team\u2019s brutal 13-0 loss to the USA was difficult to sit through; but surprisingly Barrett says he is glad it happened. \u201cThat scoreline is what used to happen in men\u2019s football in the 1960s and 70s, before proper investment went into national sides.\u201d Above: Lydia Williams, goalkeeper for Australia, taken by her teammate, defender Steph Catley: \u2018This sums up our team. We were heading into one of the biggest tournaments of our careers but we\u2019re the same free-spirited bunch of Aussies we\u2019ve always been. I lost my father suddenly last year. The unity and the family you develop are the most important part of it\u2019 Every player featured on these pages hopes to inspire a new generation, and my favourite shot from Goal Click\u2019s project is of a teenage grassroots player \u2013 Sushanti Kumari in India, a football balanced on her nose above a wide smile. These are the girls who will have been watching these past weeks \u2013 who will feel the way I did in the stands in Nice, watching England v Scotland, surrounded by women wearing kilts and covered in facepaint: inspired. \u2022 To see more photographs from the project, visit goal-click.com Above: Members of the USA team, including (from left) Ali Krieger, Alex Morgan, Tobin Heath, Allie Long and Megan Rapinoe, in pre-tournament training in San Jos\u00e9, California in May, taken by Kelley O\u2019Hara: \u2018Just 22 of my best friends getting ready for the biggest games of our lives. Football is the greatest sport on Earth. I hope the generations that come after I am done playing continue to push the sport forward\u2019 Left: Goalkeeper Hedvig Lindahl and defender Anita Asante, with other Chelsea players, boarding the plane to play in the Champions League semiifinal, taken by Ali Riley, defender for New Zealand and Chelsea: \u2018We weren\u2019t able to charter a private plane. It highlights the differences between us and the men\u2019 Right: USA defender Kelley O\u2019Hara\u2019s shot of her legs (and ice packs) at training camp: \u2018We put our bodies through hell and back\u2019 Above: Brazil defender Monica and forward Kerolin playing Teqball, a hybrid of football and table tennis, taken by defender Tamires: \u2018When I started playing football on the street, it wasn\u2019t easy because I was always the only girl, so they sometimes didn\u2019t let me play. I heard things like, \u201cFootball is for men\u201d or, \u201cGo and clean a kitchen.\u201d Some years later I had a chance to move to S\u00e3o Paulo to start my career, and I did not think twice\u2019 Left: Eug\u00e9nie Le Sommer, France\u2019s star striker, takes a picture of her foot on the ball Right: Cecilie Kvamme, Norway and Sandviken defender, playing football cards with a teammate\u2019s son, captured by fellow player Stine Hovland: \u2018I am a pre-school teacher and work in a kindergarten. But before the World Cup, I got permission from work to focus on playing. I started when I was six and made my debut for the national team when I was 27 \u2013 many years of hard work before it paid off\u2019 Above: Brazil squad members Let\u00edcia, Tamires, Kathellen and Luana before pre-World Cup training, taken by Aline Reis, their goalkeeper: \u2018Through football I\u2019ve met my best friends, earned a college and master\u2019s degree, learned to speak other languages and seen the world through a new perspective. My hope is that after this World Cup, a lot more people will appreciate and support the women\u2019s game\u2019 Left: Trondheims-\u00d8rn playing another top division Norwegian team, taken by Lauren Silver, who plays in defence there, as well as for the Jamaican national team: \u2018Playing in the snow is really hard. My toes go numb, plus the ground is slippery. Opportunities to play in Jamaica are slim. But we are making huge strides on equal pay. We\u2019ve just established contracts with the Jamaican Football Federation for the first time!\u2019 Right: The Thailand squad at training, taken by Miranda Nild, also known as Suchawadee Nildhamrong: \u2018I think we will help to inspire a new cohort of young women who want to play soccer, because they have seen people from their country go to a World Cup. My family understands my dream to play professional soccer but expect me to get a \u201creal\u201d job afterwards. That\u2019s daunting\u2019 Above: C\u00f3rdoba CF teammates walk on to their home pitch, taken by Chile defender Fernanda Pinilla: \u2018I started playing soccer at six and played with boys until I was 13, when I joined my first women\u2019s team. We do not have professional football in Chile, so I had to move to Spain. I am fulfilling a childhood dream, but leaving my family has been very difficult\u2019",

Amy Everett, online editor at Comedy Central UK, says meme-sharing is the millennial equivalent of the water cooler chat: \u201cOur job is to hit those emotional buttons and spark conversation among fans and friends.\u201d</p> <p>It is no surprise, then, that the most popular shows of the moment also generate the most memes. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/21/like-love-island-language\" title=\"\">ITV2\u2019s Love Island</a>, now on its fifth season since the reboot, is the channel\u2019s biggest show by far \u2013 and, beyond viewing figures, the proof can be found on Twitter, between 9pm and 10pm, when timelines explode with still images and gifs from the show, tweaked and repurposed with text for maximum RT-ing potential.</p> <p>\u201cMost of the classics are conveying a particular emotion so it can be used for a lot of circumstances,\u201d says ITV\u2019s head of digital, Janine Smith. Among these she lists a 2018 gif of Wes plopping himself down in the beach-hut chair, ready to dish (\u201cThe moment of anticipation is so brilliantly captured in a couple of seconds; that keeps the meme alive\u201d) and 2017\u2019s Kem and Chris in various guises (2019\u2019s \u201cReflective Night Vision Michael\u201d is the new \u201cReflective Night Vision Jack\u201d is the new \u201cReflective Night Vision Chris\u201d). \u201cWe might not have rated these as such iconic moments at the time,\u201d says Smith,\u201d but we see the memes returning year after year, especially in the hour leading up to transmission on particularly dramatic storylines.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/SXC3ymdF9NdcDK67Hs/giphy.gif\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"245\" width=\"435\" src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/SXC3ymdF9NdcDK67Hs/twitter/iframe\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Shady... Love Island.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Some of the season\u2019s most promising to date include dismissively referring to Yewande\u2019s love rival Arabella Chi as \u201cArtichoke\u201d, \u201cAreola\u201d, \u201cArancini\u201d or \u201cAra-stocracy\u201d \u2013 basically any other \u201cAr-\u201d word aside from her given name \u2013 and Molly-Mae peeking from behind a pot plant, which may yet replace Kim Kardashian-West peeking from behind a plant as the internet\u2019s favoured shorthand for stalking. But images from other shows also frequently grace the #LoveIsland timeline; SpongeBob SquarePants and Celebrity Big Brother are regulars. In turn, the best of this year\u2019s Love Island memes will live on long after the islanders have flown home and the winning couple have announced their split with a sad-face-strewn Insta post, expressing, for example, Maura-like disdain for the antics of another Tom-like doofus on an entirely different television show on an entirely different channel.</p> <p>A TV meme can never really die, but how is it born? Actually, the evolutionary biologist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/24/richard-dawkins-meaningless-meme-viral\" title=\"\">Richard Dawkins</a> coined the term \u201cmeme\u201d in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene, using the term to describe a unit of cultural information analogous to a gene. Just as a successful gene is one that transmits biological information from human to human and passes down through generations, so the most successful memes are the ones that resonate widely across the population.</p> <p>While memes tend to evolve organically, it\u2019s also possible to create them intentionally \u2013 this is the work of digital teams and social media managers \u2013 but memetic engineering, like genetic engineering, is beset with potential pitfalls. Even the @LoveIsland account, with its 1.04 million followers, couldn\u2019t convince us to take up Lucie\u2019s Cornish slang, for instance. Although \u201cStop trying to make bev happen\u201d, overlaid on an image of Regina George from Mean Girls, did trend for a while.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/cmxoOIripAgOaBWtvA/giphy.gif\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"435\" width=\"435\" src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/cmxoOIripAgOaBWtvA/twitter/iframe\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Shushy... Killing Eve.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Accordingly, Navi Lamba, head of social at BBC Three, has built her hugely successful meme dream team by closely mimicking the reproductive habits of memes in the wild. \u201cOur Slack channel feels very much like a bants channel,\u201d she says. \u201cOur chat on there is not even about shows; we make memes about each other, about things we see on the internet.\u201d The result is a work environment that mirrors that of a US sitcom writers\u2019 room, and their creative process involves regular \u201cmeme-storms\u201d where the team share ideas and suss out reactions.</p> <p>\u201cWe can kind of go ham. I just want to make my team laugh. That\u2019s my ambition \u2026 Obviously, I care about BBC Three getting good engagements and likes and increasing our range and stuff, but, ultimately, when I think about it, my main motivation is to make my team laugh with a meme.\u201d</p> <p>Some of Lamba\u2019s personal favourites include a take on \u201cWhat Americans think British guys are like \u2026 \u201d involving <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/feb/22/this-country-bbc-perfect-horrifying-tv-for-anyone-who-grew-up-in-a-village\" title=\"\">This Country\u2019s</a> Kurtan at his most seductive, a stress-relieving Summer Heights High classic for exam season and a Game of Thrones/Drag Race mashup (\u201cWhat do we say to the god of death?\u201d \u201cSashay away.\u201d) BBC Three is also the source of one of the most successful TV memes of all time, although most fans of \u201cGuy Tapping His Head\u201d would be unable to name the character (Reece Simpson, AKA Roll Safe), his creator (British actor Kayode Ewumi) or the show it came from (#HoodDocumentary), much less give BBC Three credit. A more traditional marketing manager might find that frustrating, but when you\u2019re as immersed in the social media landscape as Lamba, you appreciate the ecological balance: \u201cIt caused a bit of a spike in views for the show and the other thing was that it had a BBC logo on it, so I couldn\u2019t be mad at them. But the main thing is, it came from such a pure place, from this kid who was just like: \u2018I have a funny joke to make and the perfect gif to go with it.\u2019\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/3oz8xUK8V7suY7W9SE/giphy.gif\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"435\" width=\"435\" src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/3oz8xUK8V7suY7W9SE/twitter/iframe\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Weepy... Dawson\u2019s Creek.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>When memes are so crucial to TV\u2019s cultural impact, but so tricky to reproduce in laboratory conditions, perhaps the next logical step is to set out to make TV with memes in mind? To an extent this already happens on Love Island, which has audience engagement written into its DNA. Every episode is crammed with the meme-maker\u2019s raw materials of character confrontation and closeups on expressive faces, while the numerous ad breaks offer an opportunity for viewers to turn their attention to their timelines, and fast-turnaround edits allow producers to double down on whatever\u2019s trending. Smith insists, however, that the process is more instinctive: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a science and you can say exactly what will fly when it\u2019s published \u2026 If an Islander started to deliberately try and talk in soundbites for the purposes of trying to become a meme, I think it would be completely obvious to the digital team and would be unlikely to make the cut.\u201d</p> <p>It is harder still to deliberately imbue scripted television with meme-ability, if indeed that\u2019s even desirable. It seems one of Killing Eve\u2019s second season missteps may have been trying too hard to construct a plot around visually impressive, potential memes, such as the shot of Villanelle in kids\u2019 pyjamas putting her finger to her lips.</p> <p>In fact, unwitting creation is a feature in many of the best meme origin stories. \u201cDawson Crying\u201d, that image of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/apr/28/james-van-der-beek-dawsons-creek-interview-what-would-diplo-do\" title=\"\">James Van Der Beek</a> contorting his face into a mask of utter anguish, comes from the season three finale of teen show Dawson\u2019s Creek, which first aired on 24 May 2000. It resurfaced in 2006, when a clip was posted on YouTube, and from there made steady progress, via blogs and aggregator sites, to the TV Meme Hall of Fame. In a 2012 Huffington Post interview, Van Der Beek expressed his own feelings about Crying Dawson\u2019s internet afterlife: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t scripted, I don\u2019t think. I mean, it was appropriate for the scene. You know, it was just high drama \u2026 So I remember being completely surprised by it because it was completely sincere. [Laughs.] The fact that it\u2019s being used to mock me now, I think it\u2019s so funny.\u201d</p> <p>Not only does meme-able TV often pre-date social media altogether but, in the opinion of both Everett at Comedy Central and Lamba at BBC Three, old shows make the best new memes, and they have theories as to why.</p> <p>\u201cYou have loads of fans that have watched not once, but like 7,000 times,\u201d says Lamba. \u201cLike, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/28/gavin-and-stacey-to-return-for-a-one-off-christmas-special\" title=\"\">Gavin &amp; Stacey</a>, there\u2019s that line when Doris says: \u2018To tell you the truth Gwen, I\u2019m absolutely twatted.\u2019 The amount of times we\u2019ve taken that one iconic line and applied it to a variety of situations is insane. You just rinse those lines and you get this huge bang for your buck.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/ZErLKZeoTlKNllt7e6/giphy.gif\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"244\" width=\"435\" src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/ZErLKZeoTlKNllt7e6/twitter/iframe\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Streepy... Big Little Lies.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Everett says something similar about Comedy Central\u2019s big hitters, Friends and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (she reveals the latter has produced the channel\u2019s most-viewed clip, Will and Carlton dancing, now at 64m views on Facebook): \u201cWe\u2019re just reminding people of why they loved the shows in the first place \u2026 They know what we\u2019re talking about without having to watch the whole video and wait for the gag to be explained.\u201d</p> <p>Is it simply that audiences are so familiar with their favourite shows that they\u2019re instantly in on the joke? Or does this tell us something more fundamental about the relationship between television and memes? Maybe \u201cmeme-able\u201d is just another word for \u201cgood\u201d. As Everett says of Friends: \u201cNot a day passes where a news story or conversation happening on social media isn\u2019t somehow mirrored in the show and it never fails to drive engagement \u2026 Love, friendship, money struggles, work problems and finding your feet in the world \u2013 those themes are just as relevant in 2019 as they were in 1994.\u201d</p> <p>In other words, the best way to make a show that\u2019s meme-able is to do exactly what conscientious TV producers have always tried to do: connect with the audience at home. It\u2019s possible that the Big Little Lies team of writer David E Kelley, director Andrea Arnold and actor Meryl Streep set out to make the ultimate meme-scream and succeeded. More likely, though, they were just trying to make great television.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was a scream that expressed so much: primal grief, explosive rage, maternal power, Lady Gaga\u2019s vocal range and \u2013 most significantly \u2013 relief that Big Little Lies\u2019 follow-up series was now an assured success on a par with its 2017 debut. The moment that Meryl Streep\u2019s dinner table howl became a social media sensation \u2013 the original audio variously overdubbed with pop songs, ringtones and the perky Parks and Recreation theme tune \u2013 was also the moment that HBO could rest easy. That\u2019s how much memes mean to television. Research from 2017 revealed that around 75% of UK adults now \u201csecond screen\u201d \u2013 use another device (usually a smartphone, sometimes a laptop), while watching television; among 18-24-year-olds that goes up to 93%. According to US market researchers Statista, the most popular second-screening activities are engaging with the programme, communicating with friends about it and checking social media, all of which may well involve sharing a TV-related internet in-joke or meme, such as Homer Simpson receding into the hedgerow, or a suddenly pregnant Kylie Jenner or \u201cso random\u201d Ja\u2019mie King from Summer Heights High. Memes are how we relate to television, memes are how we remember television, and broadcasters understand this well. Amy Everett, online editor at Comedy Central UK, says meme-sharing is the millennial equivalent of the water cooler chat: \u201cOur job is to hit those emotional buttons and spark conversation among fans and friends.\u201d It is no surprise, then, that the most popular shows of the moment also generate the most memes. ITV2\u2019s Love Island, now on its fifth season since the reboot, is the channel\u2019s biggest show by far \u2013 and, beyond viewing figures, the proof can be found on Twitter, between 9pm and 10pm, when timelines explode with still images and gifs from the show, tweaked and repurposed with text for maximum RT-ing potential. \u201cMost of the classics are conveying a particular emotion so it can be used for a lot of circumstances,\u201d says ITV\u2019s head of digital, Janine Smith. Among these she lists a 2018 gif of Wes plopping himself down in the beach-hut chair, ready to dish (\u201cThe moment of anticipation is so brilliantly captured in a couple of seconds; that keeps the meme alive\u201d) and 2017\u2019s Kem and Chris in various guises (2019\u2019s \u201cReflective Night Vision Michael\u201d is the new \u201cReflective Night Vision Jack\u201d is the new \u201cReflective Night Vision Chris\u201d). \u201cWe might not have rated these as such iconic moments at the time,\u201d says Smith,\u201d but we see the memes returning year after year, especially in the hour leading up to transmission on particularly dramatic storylines.\u201d Some of the season\u2019s most promising to date include dismissively referring to Yewande\u2019s love rival Arabella Chi as \u201cArtichoke\u201d, \u201cAreola\u201d, \u201cArancini\u201d or \u201cAra-stocracy\u201d \u2013 basically any other \u201cAr-\u201d word aside from her given name \u2013 and Molly-Mae peeking from behind a pot plant, which may yet replace Kim Kardashian-West peeking from behind a plant as the internet\u2019s favoured shorthand for stalking. But images from other shows also frequently grace the #LoveIsland timeline; SpongeBob SquarePants and Celebrity Big Brother are regulars. In turn, the best of this year\u2019s Love Island memes will live on long after the islanders have flown home and the winning couple have announced their split with a sad-face-strewn Insta post, expressing, for example, Maura-like disdain for the antics of another Tom-like doofus on an entirely different television show on an entirely different channel. A TV meme can never really die, but how is it born? Actually, the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins coined the term \u201cmeme\u201d in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene, using the term to describe a unit of cultural information analogous to a gene. Just as a successful gene is one that transmits biological information from human to human and passes down through generations, so the most successful memes are the ones that resonate widely across the population. While memes tend to evolve organically, it\u2019s also possible to create them intentionally \u2013 this is the work of digital teams and social media managers \u2013 but memetic engineering, like genetic engineering, is beset with potential pitfalls. Even the @LoveIsland account, with its 1.04 million followers, couldn\u2019t convince us to take up Lucie\u2019s Cornish slang, for instance. Although \u201cStop trying to make bev happen\u201d, overlaid on an image of Regina George from Mean Girls, did trend for a while. Accordingly, Navi Lamba, head of social at BBC Three, has built her hugely successful meme dream team by closely mimicking the reproductive habits of memes in the wild. \u201cOur Slack channel feels very much like a bants channel,\u201d she says. \u201cOur chat on there is not even about shows; we make memes about each other, about things we see on the internet.\u201d The result is a work environment that mirrors that of a US sitcom writers\u2019 room, and their creative process involves regular \u201cmeme-storms\u201d where the team share ideas and suss out reactions. \u201cWe can kind of go ham. I just want to make my team laugh. That\u2019s my ambition \u2026 Obviously, I care about BBC Three getting good engagements and likes and increasing our range and stuff, but, ultimately, when I think about it, my main motivation is to make my team laugh with a meme.\u201d Some of Lamba\u2019s personal favourites include a take on \u201cWhat Americans think British guys are like \u2026 \u201d involving This Country\u2019s Kurtan at his most seductive, a stress-relieving Summer Heights High classic for exam season and a Game of Thrones/Drag Race mashup (\u201cWhat do we say to the god of death?\u201d \u201cSashay away.\u201d) BBC Three is also the source of one of the most successful TV memes of all time, although most fans of \u201cGuy Tapping His Head\u201d would be unable to name the character (Reece Simpson, AKA Roll Safe), his creator (British actor Kayode Ewumi) or the show it came from (#HoodDocumentary), much less give BBC Three credit. A more traditional marketing manager might find that frustrating, but when you\u2019re as immersed in the social media landscape as Lamba, you appreciate the ecological balance: \u201cIt caused a bit of a spike in views for the show and the other thing was that it had a BBC logo on it, so I couldn\u2019t be mad at them. But the main thing is, it came from such a pure place, from this kid who was just like: \u2018I have a funny joke to make and the perfect gif to go with it.\u2019\u201d When memes are so crucial to TV\u2019s cultural impact, but so tricky to reproduce in laboratory conditions, perhaps the next logical step is to set out to make TV with memes in mind? To an extent this already happens on Love Island, which has audience engagement written into its DNA. Every episode is crammed with the meme-maker\u2019s raw materials of character confrontation and closeups on expressive faces, while the numerous ad breaks offer an opportunity for viewers to turn their attention to their timelines, and fast-turnaround edits allow producers to double down on whatever\u2019s trending. Smith insists, however, that the process is more instinctive: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a science and you can say exactly what will fly when it\u2019s published \u2026 If an Islander started to deliberately try and talk in soundbites for the purposes of trying to become a meme, I think it would be completely obvious to the digital team and would be unlikely to make the cut.\u201d It is harder still to deliberately imbue scripted television with meme-ability, if indeed that\u2019s even desirable. It seems one of Killing Eve\u2019s second season missteps may have been trying too hard to construct a plot around visually impressive, potential memes, such as the shot of Villanelle in kids\u2019 pyjamas putting her finger to her lips. In fact, unwitting creation is a feature in many of the best meme origin stories. \u201cDawson Crying\u201d, that image of James Van Der Beek contorting his face into a mask of utter anguish, comes from the season three finale of teen show Dawson\u2019s Creek, which first aired on 24 May 2000. It resurfaced in 2006, when a clip was posted on YouTube, and from there made steady progress, via blogs and aggregator sites, to the TV Meme Hall of Fame. In a 2012 Huffington Post interview, Van Der Beek expressed his own feelings about Crying Dawson\u2019s internet afterlife: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t scripted, I don\u2019t think. I mean, it was appropriate for the scene. You know, it was just high drama \u2026 So I remember being completely surprised by it because it was completely sincere. [Laughs.] The fact that it\u2019s being used to mock me now, I think it\u2019s so funny.\u201d Not only does meme-able TV often pre-date social media altogether but, in the opinion of both Everett at Comedy Central and Lamba at BBC Three, old shows make the best new memes, and they have theories as to why. \u201cYou have loads of fans that have watched not once, but like 7,000 times,\u201d says Lamba. \u201cLike, in Gavin &amp; Stacey, there\u2019s that line when Doris says: \u2018To tell you the truth Gwen, I\u2019m absolutely twatted.\u2019 The amount of times we\u2019ve taken that one iconic line and applied it to a variety of situations is insane. You just rinse those lines and you get this huge bang for your buck.\u201d Everett says something similar about Comedy Central\u2019s big hitters, Friends and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (she reveals the latter has produced the channel\u2019s most-viewed clip, Will and Carlton dancing, now at 64m views on Facebook): \u201cWe\u2019re just reminding people of why they loved the shows in the first place \u2026 They know what we\u2019re talking about without having to watch the whole video and wait for the gag to be explained.\u201d Is it simply that audiences are so familiar with their favourite shows that they\u2019re instantly in on the joke? Or does this tell us something more fundamental about the relationship between television and memes? Maybe \u201cmeme-able\u201d is just another word for \u201cgood\u201d. As Everett says of Friends: \u201cNot a day passes where a news story or conversation happening on social media isn\u2019t somehow mirrored in the show and it never fails to drive engagement \u2026 Love, friendship, money struggles, work problems and finding your feet in the world \u2013 those themes are just as relevant in 2019 as they were in 1994.\u201d In other words, the best way to make a show that\u2019s meme-able is to do exactly what conscientious TV producers have always tried to do: connect with the audience at home. It\u2019s possible that the Big Little Lies team of writer David E Kelley, director Andrea Arnold and actor Meryl Streep set out to make the ultimate meme-scream and succeeded. More likely, though, they were just trying to make great television.",

      "body": "<p>I am currently working away from home, abandoning my family to selfishly pursue my own interests \u2013 or at least, that\u2019s how I felt the week before I left. During that time, I couldn\u2019t simply look forward to the prospect of some time alone doing the things I love \u2013 time being myself. No, instead I was overwhelmed by everything I thought I needed to do, because although I am an author, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/jilly-cooper\" title=\"\">Jilly Cooper</a> fan, a collector of vintage china, a nail-biter, a bad applier of fake tan and a country music lover, I am also a parent. And, like so many of us, I sometimes forget all the other parts of who I am and lose sight of <em>me</em>.</p> <p>So it was that, as I packed, I found myself sobbing hopelessly because the mother part of me tends to take over all the rest, and instead of thinking about the exciting work I would be doing while I was away, what Jilly Coopers to take, if anything could be done about my gnawed nails and bad fake tan, I was focusing on all my failings as a parent. A parent who was abandoning her children to go gallivanting.</p> <p>Would their father cope? Would he do packed lunches properly \u2013 what if he ran out of yoghurts and juice boxes? What about the fact that I was missing sports day <em>and</em> prize-giving? What about the parties he would have to ferry them to and the pick up/drop off arrangements with other parents he\u2019d need to keep track of? How could anyone other than me possibly manage? </p> <p>But eventually I thought about things more clearly. My husband has experience of managing quite complex projects. He can cope. And, actually, our family would not fall apart without me and that, sometimes, I <em>needed</em> to go away and do things for myself \u2013 as a person, not just an extension of my children \u2013 because I am more than just a parent, and I should make more of an effort to remind myself of that.</p> <p>The crisis passed, but left me wondering what I could do to keep hold of that idea of self we tend to bury when we have kids. Here is my checklist.</p> <h2><strong>Remember Shirley Valentine</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s easy to forget who you really are when you are caught up in the day-to-day grind and you seem to be the only person in the house who can find the clean socks and the missing homework that is, in fact, right in front of them.</p> <p>I was only 12 years old when <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098319/\">Shirley Valentine</a> came out, and my mother and her friends adored it, but I just didn\u2019t get it. Why was it so funny? Years later, when I was a mother myself, I watched it again and I totally got it \u2013 it all comes down to that moment when she wonders where Shirley Valentine has gone. I think most mothers have had moments when they look up from the drudgery and think: \u201cWho am I? Where did I go? When did folding pants and Googling \u2018How long can a child not eat vegetables before they get scurvy?\u2019 become my life? Why aren\u2019t I dancing on tables and changing the world?\u201d and then we understand exactly why Shirley left a note saying, \u201cGone to Greece, back in two weeks.\u201d</p> <p>So remember, it doesn\u2019t have to be Greece (it could just be a night out <em>sans</em> kids at a Greek restaurant) but you do need to get out of the house. On your own \u2013 or at least without children.</p> <h2><strong>Soft play is not an adult destination</strong></h2> <p>But hanging on to your sense of self doesn\u2019t need to involve time away from your children. If you can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to leave them behind, there is no reason why they should dictate every day\u2019s activities. Instead of soft play centres and playgrounds, take them to art galleries or castles, if those are your thing, even if they complain \u2013 and don\u2019t they complain about everything anyway? My own cherubs have an encyclopedic knowledge of <a href=\"https://www.stirlingcastle.scot/\" title=\"\">Stirling Castle</a>, rather against their will, courtesy of frequent visits due to my desire to get my money\u2019s worth out of my Historic Scotland membership and sneak into the dressing-up room to pretend I was Mary, Queen of Scots, to their mortification.</p> <h2><strong>Be selfish \u2013 your kids will be better people for realising you have needs, too</strong></h2> <p>Mothers have often felt the need to put themselves last, even if it means losing sight of who they really are, but social media has taken that to the next level. I saw the most depressing \u201cmotherhood\u201d meme recently. It said: \u201cOnce you become a mother, you stop being the picture and become the frame.\u201d Yep, motherhood apparently means you now exist only as an accessory to your children, and you yourself are insignificant and inconsequential.</p> <p>Parenthood can make you feel invisible at the best of times, but when it\u2019s reinforced in this way, it\u2019s not just harmful to us, it\u2019s not actually terribly good for children, either. I had a brief stint as a Cubs leader and it was immediately apparent that many of the children there were completely unaccustomed to hearing the word no. They were nice enough kids, but they struggled to grasp the concept of waiting their turn, not getting their own way or doing anything for themselves \u2013 because their parents were so present, so involved, to such an all-consuming extent that you wondered whether they even had a life beyond their children.</p> <p>People quite often ask me for my top piece of parenting advice (which is terrifying, as it implies there are people out there who think I know about parenting) and I always say that just because you would die for your children, it doesn\u2019t mean you have to live for them. So put yourself in the centre of the picture once in a while: tell them to find whatever it is they\u2019re looking for themselves (or do without), eat the last biscuit because no one is going to be thoughtful enough to leave it for Mum, and forge your own sense of motherhood \u2013 one that doesn\u2019t mean you disappear as a person and reappear as a social-media platitude.</p> <h2><strong>Stop talking about your children</strong></h2> <p>Anything that helps you keep hold of the fact that you are a person, not just a parent, is good, but one of the best things you can do is spend time with friends with whom the basis of your friendship is not your kids. Of course, those parental friendships are great, too, and get us through many a tough day when our darlings are tiny, but nothing anchors us to our sense of self like an adult conversation that doesn\u2019t centre around kids.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/dec/02/i-love-being-a-mother-its-just-the-word-that-bothers-me\">I love being a mother \u2013 it's just the word that bothers me</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Remember those people with whom you have things in common other than children? They are the ones who will really help to bring you back to yourself by offering a precious few hours (or moments, even) of being you. They won\u2019t define you as Someone\u2019s Mummy or Daddy, they will be able to discuss subjects other than whether John Lewis vouchers are a suitable teacher present (yes \u2013 worst-case scenario, they can spend it on posh gin in Waitrose), and you won\u2019t have to shout, \u201cI said no hitting!\u201d every 30 seconds.</p> <p>Sometimes, there isn\u2019t time to keep up these friendships in person. Old friends move away and you\u2019re lucky to see each other once a year, but email, texts and Messenger mean it\u2019s easier than ever to keep in touch, and <em>real </em>old friends will be able to pick up where they left off. And if you\u2019re really lucky, as you pass out of the haze of the soft-play years, you\u2019ll start making new friends for yourself again. Maybe you\u2019ll even find that some of those people you started talking to only because the other option was to smash yourself in the face with a maraca to take away the pain of the baby music class, have actually become real friends in their own right.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/why-mummy-doesn-t-give-a-9780008301255.html\" title=\"\">Why Mummy Doesn\u2019t Give A ****!</a> by Gill Sims is published by HarperCollins.</p> <p>If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:\" title=\"\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

Parenthood can make you feel invisible at the best of times, but when it\u2019s reinforced in this way, it\u2019s not just harmful to us, it\u2019s not actually terribly good for children, either. I had a brief stint as a Cubs leader and it was immediately apparent that many of the children there were completely unaccustomed to hearing the word no. They were nice enough kids, but they struggled to grasp the concept of waiting their turn, not getting their own way or doing anything for themselves \u2013 because their parents were so present, so involved, to such an all-consuming extent that you wondered whether they even had a life beyond their children. People quite often ask me for my top piece of parenting advice (which is terrifying, as it implies there are people out there who think I know about parenting) and I always say that just because you would die for your children, it doesn\u2019t mean you have to live for them. So put yourself in the centre of the picture once in a while: tell them to find whatever it is they\u2019re looking for themselves (or do without), eat the last biscuit because no one is going to be thoughtful enough to leave it for Mum, and forge your own sense of motherhood \u2013 one that doesn\u2019t mean you disappear as a person and reappear as a social-media platitude. Stop talking about your children Anything that helps you keep hold of the fact that you are a person, not just a parent, is good, but one of the best things you can do is spend time with friends with whom the basis of your friendship is not your kids. Of course, those parental friendships are great, too, and get us through many a tough day when our darlings are tiny, but nothing anchors us to our sense of self like an adult conversation that doesn\u2019t centre around kids. Remember those people with whom you have things in common other than children? They are the ones who will really help to bring you back to yourself by offering a precious few hours (or moments, even) of being you. They won\u2019t define you as Someone\u2019s Mummy or Daddy, they will be able to discuss subjects other than whether John Lewis vouchers are a suitable teacher present (yes \u2013 worst-case scenario, they can spend it on posh gin in Waitrose), and you won\u2019t have to shout, \u201cI said no hitting!\u201d every 30 seconds. Sometimes, there isn\u2019t time to keep up these friendships in person. Old friends move away and you\u2019re lucky to see each other once a year, but email, texts and Messenger mean it\u2019s easier than ever to keep in touch, and real old friends will be able to pick up where they left off. And if you\u2019re really lucky, as you pass out of the haze of the soft-play years, you\u2019ll start making new friends for yourself again. Maybe you\u2019ll even find that some of those people you started talking to only because the other option was to smash yourself in the face with a maraca to take away the pain of the baby music class, have actually become real friends in their own right. \u2022 Why Mummy Doesn\u2019t Give A ****! by Gill Sims is published by HarperCollins.

What did you talk about? His friends, his family, his job... there was little leeway for a two-way conversation. Any awkward moments? Our debate about Pip from Great Expectations \u2013 turns out you either love him or justifiably hate the guy. Good table manners? He stole his unfinished pint to take on the tube. Best thing about Ty? He knew what he wanted to talk about, and he did it well \u2013 he is clearly confident, which is a good trait. Would you introduce him to your friends? I\u2019m not sure he is particularly similar to my pals. Describe Ty in three words Talkative, self-assured, tipsy. What do you think he made of you? I think he thought I was quite chill?

Four for effort. Would you meet again? I don\u2019t think so \u2013 although it turns out we roam similar parts of London, so it may be more of an awkward run-in than anything else. Ty on Rachel What were you hoping for? A manic pixie dream girl or free hummus. First impressions? She was cool and comfortable with my lateness. What did you talk about? Books I hate, stuff my friends told me to say on the date, philosophy, this other date I\u2019d been on, this other date Rachel had been on. Any awkward moments? It was remarkably un-awkward. Good table manners? Her ability to manipulate food with a knife and fork was good. Best thing about Rachel? When we divided the leftovers, she let me have first pick \u2013 I\u2019m sure the homeless guy I gave all my food to appreciated that. Would you introduce her to your friends? They wanted to FaceTime me and say hi, but I was being sensible. Describe Rachel in three words Actually quite safe. What do you think she made of you? Probably that I\u2019m a bit of an idiot. Did you go on somewhere? Rachel got the tube home and then I went and hung out with my fake cousin and a girl we met who was on a stopover in London. And... did you kiss? Nope. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? I\u2019d do it the same, but in Greece. Marks out of 10?

      "body": "<p>On Saturday I am woken by what sounds like the hooves of eight tiny reindeer skittering above my head. I know from experience that the noise is being made by a single fat crow hopping along the roof tiles, up over the peak and back again, in a display of manic vigilance.</p> <p>I open my eyes. Sunlight is streaming through the open window. The crow bounces and skids over my head. It is the most glorious of summer mornings; a day to be seized. I look at the time. It\u2019s 4.20am.</p> <p>Eventually I fall back asleep and have a dream in which I discover all the missing things that my wife ever loved \u2013 bits of jewellery, favourite sunglasses, a nice mug, some prized teeth \u2013 hidden in an old rucksack of mine.

      "bodyText": "On Saturday I am woken by what sounds like the hooves of eight tiny reindeer skittering above my head. I know from experience that the noise is being made by a single fat crow hopping along the roof tiles, up over the peak and back again, in a display of manic vigilance. I open my eyes. Sunlight is streaming through the open window. The crow bounces and skids over my head. It is the most glorious of summer mornings; a day to be seized. I look at the time. It\u2019s 4.20am. Eventually I fall back asleep and have a dream in which I discover all the missing things that my wife ever loved \u2013 bits of jewellery, favourite sunglasses, a nice mug, some prized teeth \u2013 hidden in an old rucksack of mine. I have no idea how they got there, but I can see it looks bad. I wake again at half past seven, consumed by guilt. My wife is already up, looking at her phone. I look at my phone.

      "body": "<p>A skeleton of one of the most remarkable racehorses of all time is to be an unusual addition to a major survey of work by the 18th-century painter George Stubbs.</p> <p>The horse, Eclipse, was an undefeated racing superstar until he was retired to stud in 1771. Today, 95% of thoroughbreds trace their descent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/mar/04/horseracing.features\">back to Eclipse</a> and the remaining 5% have him in their pedigrees.</p> <p>His skeleton is part of the <a href=\"https://www.rvc.ac.uk/about/the-rvc/history\">collection of the Royal Veterinary College</a>. The college will lend the skeleton so it can be seen alongside Stubbs\u2019s anatomical studies of horses and his paintings of Eclipse.</p> <p>It will be the biggest Stubbs exhibition for 35 years, showing at the new-look <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/mar/05/mk-gallery-review-milton-keynes\">MK Gallery in Milton Keynes</a> this autumn.</p> <p>Anthony Spira, the gallery\u2019s director, said there were pressing reasons for doing a Stubbs show in 2019.

      "bodyText": "A skeleton of one of the most remarkable racehorses of all time is to be an unusual addition to a major survey of work by the 18th-century painter George Stubbs. The horse, Eclipse, was an undefeated racing superstar until he was retired to stud in 1771. Today, 95% of thoroughbreds trace their descent back to Eclipse and the remaining 5% have him in their pedigrees. His skeleton is part of the collection of the Royal Veterinary College. The college will lend the skeleton so it can be seen alongside Stubbs\u2019s anatomical studies of horses and his paintings of Eclipse. It will be the biggest Stubbs exhibition for 35 years, showing at the new-look MK Gallery in Milton Keynes this autumn. Anthony Spira, the gallery\u2019s director, said there were pressing reasons for doing a Stubbs show in 2019. He said the artist was \u201cone of the most forensic and empathetic chroniclers\u201d of nature. Spira added: \u201cIt feels really urgent to look at the natural world. We\u2019re living at a time of extinction, species are disappearing every day and what better guide than George Stubbs to remember how to appreciate the natural world.\u201d Stubbs is known as a brilliant painter of horses but he was much more, said Spira. \u201cHe did the most extraordinary anatomical drawings, he was known as the Liverpudlian Leonardo \u2026 he was a genuine artist-scientist.\u201d The show will include what were groundbreaking and forensic drawings of horses made during an intense 18-month period of dissection and classification. Little-known anatomical studies of humans will also feature. Horses will take centre stage, including the rare loan by the National Gallery of Stubbs\u2019s best known work, Whistlejacket. The exhibition is a sign of the ambition of the gallery, which reopened in March after a \u00a312m revamp, doubling its size. It will come after the current Paula Rego show, which was given a five-star review by the Guardian\u2019s Adrian Searle. Spira said the gallery wanted to have a mix of contemporary and historical shows. \u201cThe idea of having an old master in a modern setting is very exciting,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there is something very contemporary about Stubbs\u2019 work, about the cropping and the backdrops and the plain backgrounds and that idea of empathy with the natural world. \u201cHe had an excitement about discovering the natural world and the animal kingdom that is at complete odds with where we are today. It feels very urgent to appreciate how vulnerable and valuable the natural world is.\u201d The show will also include depictions by Stubbs of cheetahs, lemurs and his remarkable painting of a rhinoceros that was exhibited in 18th-century Britain. After Milton Keynes, a version of the show will tour to the Mauritshuis art museum in The Hague for the first Stubbs exhibition in the Netherlands. \u2022 George Stubbs: All Done from Nature is at the MK Gallery from 12 October to 26 January \u2022 This article was amended on 11 July 2019 because an earlier version said the exhibition would open on 11 October.

Meetings must now consist of them sitting round a bucket, hurling pieces of dog excrement into it as they call out the most derivative, asinine, morally bankrupt ideas they can think of. When the bucket is full, they mould the contents into a programme.</p> <p>And so to Channel 4\u2019s Shitmates \u2013 Shipmates in its official listing, but that need not detain us here. The conceit? It\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/love-island\">Love Island</a> on a ship. Thassit. If you\u2019ve ever seen Love Island \u2013 or absorbed its basics through cultural osmosis \u2013 and a ship, you have its essence.</p> <p>I watch them all with the fascinated gaze of a time-travelling Victorian anthropologist. I am baffled by but eager to comprehend the social and inner workings of a species superficially the same as my own and yet so far removed from it. I must take copious notes to returning to my Royal Society brethren for further understanding.</p> <p>There is, in these situations, always a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin\">MacGuffin</a> that requires lots of young, attractive people to be brought together on camera to be filmed in their swimwear. This time, it has been decreed that two groups on a cruise round the Med will compete to win a trip to Bali by becoming the most popular, as voted for by all 1,500 passengers on board. We are not told how this popularity will be attained. I think it might be by who spreads the least chlamydia. But, notepad and pencil in hand, let me creep closer to watch events unfold.</p> <p>There are 10 of the usual suspects: perfectly buffed, coiffed, occasionally augmented twentysomethings, built from extruded plastic and delivered from the factory with their original settings active. They are all pathologically confident, enthusiastic, up for a shared vision of a good time and dementedly happy (except when sobbing at a slight real or imagined).</p> <p>Five friends \u2013 Sean, Charlotte, Maddi, Lewis and Ashley \u2013 are on one team. They are also on another team, but this time they are called Ed, Lauren, Georgia, Jay and Jordan. Or maybe they are different people. Charlotte has a thing for Lewis and they once had a thing together. But Lewis is developing a thing for Lauren. Lauren does not have a thing for Lewis, though she might have a thing for Ed even though Georgia might also have a thing for Ed and they nearly once had a thing together, but she might let Lewis think she has a thing for him if it helps them win the MacGuffin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c80a3bf960a85ff92632d391a61cbb523a8580cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c80a3bf960a85ff92632d391a61cbb523a8580cd/100_0_2801_1681/1000.jpg\" alt=\"All above board \u2026 Sean, Maddi, Charlotte, Lewis and Ashley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Identikit competitors \u2026 Sean, Maddi, Charlotte, Lewis and Ashley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FullFat TV/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They compete in deck games that not-so-inadvertently bring their primary and secondary sexual characteristics into occasional contact, with much screaming delight among the 10 and many prayers for death from me.</p> <p>They party, which even-less-inadvertently brings their primary and secondary sexual characteristics into contact with other guests\u2019. This occasions much sobbing from Charlotte (who feels \u201cdisrespected\u201d by Lewis because he has not brought his sexual characteristics into contact with hers tonight, maybe ever. I am not sure at this point. I am only sure who Charlotte is because she told us she once bruised her feefee and it \u201cswelled up like a golf ball\u201d. I must consult upon what exactly a feefee is on my return.)</p> <p>They deal with unexpected arrivals \u2013 \u201cstowaways\u201d, in the parlance of the organisers. One is Maddi\u2019s work colleague Nadine. Everyone likes Nadine, but because Nadine is old enough to remember the first smartphones they do not know how to use Nadine to boost their popularity. Nadine is lucky there are no ice floes in the Med \u2013 she would find herself adrift in no time. The other stowaway is Josh, with whom Georgia once had a thing on holiday. He would still have a thing with her but she is not sure she wants another thing with him. I am getting the measure of this tribe and think it may only be a matter of time, especially if she cannot have a thing with Ed.</p> <p>My notebook is full. It is strange. I feel there is much to learn here and yet my brain is starting to leak out of my ears. It is time, I think, to jump ship.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I think it\u2019s clear now \u2013 and probably has been for several years to those who keep a courageously watchful eye on these things \u2013 that the producers of reality TV shows are having a contempt-off. Meetings must now consist of them sitting round a bucket, hurling pieces of dog excrement into it as they call out the most derivative, asinine, morally bankrupt ideas they can think of. When the bucket is full, they mould the contents into a programme. And so to Channel 4\u2019s Shitmates \u2013 Shipmates in its official listing, but that need not detain us here. The conceit? It\u2019s Love Island on a ship. Thassit. If you\u2019ve ever seen Love Island \u2013 or absorbed its basics through cultural osmosis \u2013 and a ship, you have its essence. I watch them all with the fascinated gaze of a time-travelling Victorian anthropologist. I am baffled by but eager to comprehend the social and inner workings of a species superficially the same as my own and yet so far removed from it. I must take copious notes to returning to my Royal Society brethren for further understanding. There is, in these situations, always a MacGuffin that requires lots of young, attractive people to be brought together on camera to be filmed in their swimwear. This time, it has been decreed that two groups on a cruise round the Med will compete to win a trip to Bali by becoming the most popular, as voted for by all 1,500 passengers on board. We are not told how this popularity will be attained. I think it might be by who spreads the least chlamydia. But, notepad and pencil in hand, let me creep closer to watch events unfold. There are 10 of the usual suspects: perfectly buffed, coiffed, occasionally augmented twentysomethings, built from extruded plastic and delivered from the factory with their original settings active. They are all pathologically confident, enthusiastic, up for a shared vision of a good time and dementedly happy (except when sobbing at a slight real or imagined). Five friends \u2013 Sean, Charlotte, Maddi, Lewis and Ashley \u2013 are on one team. They are also on another team, but this time they are called Ed, Lauren, Georgia, Jay and Jordan. Or maybe they are different people. Charlotte has a thing for Lewis and they once had a thing together. But Lewis is developing a thing for Lauren. Lauren does not have a thing for Lewis, though she might have a thing for Ed even though Georgia might also have a thing for Ed and they nearly once had a thing together, but she might let Lewis think she has a thing for him if it helps them win the MacGuffin. They compete in deck games that not-so-inadvertently bring their primary and secondary sexual characteristics into occasional contact, with much screaming delight among the 10 and many prayers for death from me. They party, which even-less-inadvertently brings their primary and secondary sexual characteristics into contact with other guests\u2019. This occasions much sobbing from Charlotte (who feels \u201cdisrespected\u201d by Lewis because he has not brought his sexual characteristics into contact with hers tonight, maybe ever. I am not sure at this point. I am only sure who Charlotte is because she told us she once bruised her feefee and it \u201cswelled up like a golf ball\u201d. I must consult upon what exactly a feefee is on my return.) They deal with unexpected arrivals \u2013 \u201cstowaways\u201d, in the parlance of the organisers. One is Maddi\u2019s work colleague Nadine. Everyone likes Nadine, but because Nadine is old enough to remember the first smartphones they do not know how to use Nadine to boost their popularity. Nadine is lucky there are no ice floes in the Med \u2013 she would find herself adrift in no time. The other stowaway is Josh, with whom Georgia once had a thing on holiday. He would still have a thing with her but she is not sure she wants another thing with him. I am getting the measure of this tribe and think it may only be a matter of time, especially if she cannot have a thing with Ed. My notebook is full. It is strange. I feel there is much to learn here and yet my brain is starting to leak out of my ears. It is time, I think, to jump ship.",

He knew I liked football (I kept quiet about my love of Spurs so as not to cause offence), and was a source of tickets for matches at Upton Park. One Saturday the whole family was invited. My father was whisked off to the boardroom, while my mother and I were ushered into the purdah of the ladies\u2019 lounge with the players\u2019 and directors\u2019 wives. They might as well have shut us away in a drawer out of sight.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Football is a kind of universal language. It always was, but females were shut out of it and now they aren\u2019t</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Fast-forward a few years. \u201cI\u2019ve nothing against women but why must they always infiltrate?\u201d bleated the elderly deputy sports editor of the Observer in 1973 when female journalists made moves to join the male-only Press Club. That was the year I became a football writer. My first match report was Coventry v Spurs. I phoned over my copy in the press room, and when I put the phone down I realised there was absolute silence. All the blokes had been listening. \u201cThat was very good,\u201d said the one sitting next to me. He sounded a bit relieved. If truth be told, I felt relieved too. I knew men felt uncomfortable if a woman embarrassed herself. And it was very nice of him to have complimented me. Later, much later, like 40 years on from then, I thought, \u201cWhat. The. Hell. Who was he to judge how I did my job?\u201d What if the situation had been reversed? What if I\u2019d told this condescending little twit his report was good?</p> <p>A bit later, on a wintry Saturday afternoon I was shivering at Portman Road, Ipswich Town\u2019s home ground, when the journo sitting behind me barked: \u201cWomen in the press box. Pah!\u201d and the one next to him sniggered. I was shocked. It wasn\u2019t his press box. Football was for everyone.

How could it be national if 50% of the population weren\u2019t allowed to play it, report on it or have an opinion on it? But at the same time I worried terribly about upsetting all the men just by being there. The stands were always packed tight with males, as though a giant with a huge dustpan and brush had swept up every single one for miles around and emptied them into the stadium. It was so normal I never really thought about it. I was made to feel like the abnormal one.

      "bodyText": "A federal court judge has excoriated the Australian government, accusing it of putting its relationship with Nauru ahead of complying with court orders and federal law. The judgement by Justice Debra Mortimer was published on Friday, after the government failed to comply with a 14 June order to transfer a refugee with \u201cserious medical and psychiatric issues\u201d to Australia under the medevac laws. The transfer was approved by the Australian government but held up by the Nauru government\u2019s requirement for multiple levels of approval, which were then delayed for this man\u2019s case. \u201cThe respondents [the immigration minister and the commonwealth of Australia] have already made it abundantly clear they do not intend to take any further steps, if those steps could adversely affect the commonwealth\u2019s relationship with Nauru,\u201d Mortimer wrote. \u201cThey have already made it clear they consider they have done all they are prepared to do. It is not that they have taken all the steps within their power, but they have done all they are prepared to do, taking the context of their relationship with Nauru into account.\u201d Mortimer ordered the Australian government to explicitly set out what steps \u201cif any\u201d it has taken to secure the man\u2019s transfer from Nauru, and to provide the names of those who caused or contributed to the delay. Australia\u2019s medevac laws require the government to transfer refugees and asylum seekers to Australia for medical treatment if two doctors determine it is necessary and it is not available on Manus Island or Nauru. However Nauru, which has also banned telemedicine consultations, requires all medical evacuation requests go through the notoriously problematic Overseas Medical Review (OMR) process, and get \u201cuplift approval\u201d from a senior bureaucrat. \u201cAt one level, responsibility for the applicant\u2019s transfer having not been effected lies principally with the government of Nauru,\u201d said Mortimer. \u201cAt another level, the responsibility for the applicant\u2019s transfer having not been effected lies with the respondents, who have, on the evidence: formed a view that they need to defer to the government of Nauru by not engaging in any conduct which they apprehend might lead to criticism or complaint from the government of Nauru, or which might cause the transfer of the applicant to be further impeded; and chosen to give preference to an approach which places the commonwealth\u2019s relationship with Nauru ahead of the steps both the first respondent \u2026 and this court \u2026 have determined to be necessary to undertake for the applicant\u2019s health and welfare.\u201d The transfer of the refugee, in his mid 30s, was approved on two separate occasions by the department of home affairs \u2013 first under the original processes and again in late June under the medevac laws. The transfer had been referred to the OMR by Australia\u2019s healthcare contractor, International Health and Medical Services (IHMS), in mid June, but it was not addressed at the next OMR meeting on 13 June. The next meeting a fortnight later then held over the decision because it wanted another medical assessment, and delayed their decisions to 11 July. IHMS told the department it gave the OMR committee \u201ca comprehensive and appropriate clinical briefing\u201d but didn\u2019t hand over the medical reports provided by two doctors under the medevac laws because it would be counterproductive. A branch commander within the home affairs department, Peter Timson, told the court that to upset the Nauruans could impede further transfers, and it was therefore \u201cessential \u2026 that Australia retains and builds upon its strong working relationships with Nauruan officials\u201d. This included respecting the Nauruan government\u2019s procedural requirements and not transferring anyone without their desired approvals, and for Australia courts to not make any orders which \u201cappear to be premised on the notion that the Australian government controls what happens on the ground in Nauru\u201d. For similar reasons the Australian government also sought to have an affidavit from the department\u2019s regional processing assistant secretary, Alana Sullivan, suppressed, suggesting to the court that the contents of it would cause Nauruan officials \u201csignificant embarrassment\u201d if made public. Mortimer declined the government\u2019s application but gave it leave to withdraw the affidavit from its file and no longer rely on it as evidence if it wanted. She said if the government wanted the court to \u201cstep back\u201d from making any further orders in this case then it should do so \u201copenly\u201d. \u201c[N]ot by reliance on evidence that is hidden from public scrutiny, even when it may tend to reveal the very difficult situation the respondents now find themselves in because the commonwealth chose to enter into arrangements of the kind set out in the MOU [memorandum of understanding] and the administrative arrangements with another sovereign state.\u201d",

Here\u2019s a recap and key links from the day: The Trump administration said it would continue to fight to add a citizenship question to the US Census even after the Commerce department announced it would print the questionnaire without that question. Kamala Harris\u2019s campaign announced that she raised $12m in the second quarter, which places her behind three other candidates who announced their fundraising amounts earlier this week. Trump faced criticisms for making himself the center of his Independence Day speech and for suggesting that airplanes existed in 1775. The US jobs report showed job growth rebounding after an unusual slowdown in hiring in May. A 52-year-old man from Nicaragua died in US custody after he was rushed to the hospital. Joe Biden hit out at the Democratic party\u2019s left wing on Friday, claiming firebrand progressives cannot win in battleground states. Current and former employees at Trump properties said the president had knowingly hired undocumented people. The Washington Post takes a look at how just how much paper the 2020 Census will require. Spoiler alert: it\u2019s a lot. Another update in the court battle over the Census citizenship question: The American Civil Liberties Union and others have asked a federal court in New York to block the Trump administration from delaying the printing of 2020 census forms or changing the forms to include the citizenship question. Dale Ho, director of the ACLU\u2019s voting rights project, said in a statement: The Trump administration repeatedly argued the census forms could not be altered after June 30. They\u2019ve now changed their tune because the Supreme Court ruled against them. They can\u2019t have it both ways. Trump\u2019s lawlessness will not go unanswered.\u201d You can read the full motion here. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris echoed their Democratic presidential rival Elizabeth Warren today when they promised to nominate an educator as secretary of education, the AP reports: \u201cWe don\u2019t treat you with dignity,\u201d Biden, the former vice president, told thousands of public school teachers gathered for the National Education Association (NEA) convention in Texas. \u201cIf I am president, it will change on day one.\u201d Harris, a California senator, pledged a secretary \u201cfrom public schools\u201d and added that NEA, the nation\u2019s largest union, \u201cwill be at the table to help me make that decision.\u201d Warren had already promised to nominate an educator earlier in the campaign. The Guardian\u2019s Mona Chalabi has created a graphic to illustrate just how severe the overcrowding is at some US migrant detention facilities: Mona explains: Overcrowding is so severe at some US migrant detention facilities that adult detainees are held in cells where they each have less than 0.3 sq meters of space. A report released this week showed photographs of detainees pressed against the outermost walls of cells, but to understand the extent of the overcrowding, the Guardian contacted a research agency called Forensic Architecture that is based at the University of London. The researchers began with a photograph that was included in Tuesday\u2019s report about conditions at the Rio Grande detention facility in Texas. The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) found that 88 adult men were being held in a cell with a maximum capacity of 41. More here: There has been another death in Customs and Border Protection (CBP) custody, according to the agency. A 52-year-old man from Nicaragua died after he was rushed to the hospital. The agency said he was part of a group of 36 people from Central America that had surrendered to agents near Sasabe, Arizona. The US government has faced intense scrutiny over the last year surrounding in-custody deaths of migrants. Read some of their stories here: A sexual assault survivor approached Biden today and said she was devastated to watch the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the supreme court, asking him what his plan would be to address the GOP takeover of the court. Hear his response: \u201cThe plan is to appoint the right people. That\u2019s the plan,\u201d he said, adding that he was against packing the courts, referring to the idea some Democrats support of expanding the court. Earlier, he said he would consider nominating Merrick Garland, Obama\u2019s former supreme court nominee: The president has begun his three-day golf weekend, bringing the total in taxpayer money spent on his golf hobby to more than $108m, according to HuffPost: The president has spent 60 days at his course in Virginia, 59 days at Bedminster and 57 days at his resort in West Palm Beach, the report said, adding that he he also visited courses in Los Angeles, Doral and Jupiter in Florida, Scotland, and Ireland. HuffPost calculated that Trump has spent 187 days on a golf course that he owns since taking office \u2013 which is two-and-a-half times the number of days Obama had visited golf courses at this point in his first term. Hello - Sam Levin in Los Angeles here, taking over our live coverage for the rest of the day. Because the Trump administration has refused to back down on its efforts to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, the court case challenging the White House will move forward: That means the court is on track to hear arguments about whether officials were motivated by racial bias when seeking to add the citizenship question. A US district judge has ordered discovery to start today in the Maryland lawsuit: The Trump administration will continue to fight to add a citizenship question to the US Census, something the president has said repeatedly since the Commerce department announced on Tuesday that the questionnaire was being printed without the question. Senator Kamala Harris\u2019s presidential campaign announced her campaign raised $12m in the second quarter, which places her behind three other candidates who announced their fundraising amounts earlier this week. In an essay for Essence magazine, Elizabeth Warren outlined a plan for executive orders to curb the race and pay gaps. \u201cWe need to demand that companies and the government properly value the work of Black women \u2014 and hold them accountable if they don\u2019t,\u201d she wrote. A life-size statue on the outskirts of Sevnica, Melania Trump\u2019s home town, was carved into a tree using a chainsaw. The artist, Brad Downey, says it\u2019s the first monument anywhere dedicated to the current first lady. Donald Trump said today that he had stop employing undocumented immigrants at his properties after numerous current and former undocumented employees spoke out about the contradictions in anti-immigrant rhetoric when he relies on immigrants in his workforce. One of those workers, Sandra Diaz, who obtained legal immigration status after quitting her job at Trump\u2019s Bedminster club, told the New York Daily News that undocumented people still work at his business. \u201cHe\u2019s still lying as always,\u201d Diaz said. Anibal Romero, an attorney who represents Diaz and 43 other undocumented ex-Trump employees, reiterated his belief that Trump knowingly hired undocumented people. \u201cHe knowingly hired these undocumented workers for years when he wanted to financially profit from their hard work,\u201d Romero said. \u201cNow he wants to deport them when he wants to politically profit from their plight.\u201d Sandra Diaz pictured here with another former undocumented Trump employee, Victorina Morales, during an interview last year. The undocumented ex-Trump employees say management at the clubs they worked at knew of their illegal status but hired them anyways. Some of the former workers alleged managers even set them up with fake immigration papers. Sevnica, the Slovenian home town of the US first lady, now boasts a statue of its most famous daughter - and it\u2019s great! The artist, Brad Downey, says it\u2019s the first monument anywhere dedicated to Melania Trump. Can you prove him wrong? Please email me if so: amanda.holpuch@theguardian.com. There\u2019s a new, deeply reported story in South Carolina\u2019s the State newspaper, investigating the notion that Joe Biden is set to win South Carolina\u2019s presidential primary, in part because of his popularity with the state\u2019s black voters. The reporters concluded that as Biden faces questions about his record on race, which has impacted his standing with black voters nationally: \u201cmany African Americans across generations in South Carolina told The State they do not associate themselves with the criticism the former vice president has received.\u201d Elections are complicated. More from the report, which puts an important emphasis on the voices of actual voters: They said enthusiasm for Biden\u2019s candidacy derives from a combination of strategic thinking about who can beat President Donald Trump and a deep emotional connection to the man who served alongside Barack Obama, the country\u2019s first black president. And older black voters said they trust Biden to unite the country. If they turn out in large numbers next year \u2014 as they did in 2016, when the over-45 age bracket represented more than 70% of those participating in the S.C. Democratic presidential primary \u2014 that sensibility could prevail. Just last week 2020 presidential hopeful Marianne Williamson was on the Democratic debate stage, promising to call New Zealand as her first act in office. Now, a week out from the first round of debates, Politico has an analysis of which members of the crowded Democratic field could see the next round of debates. Currently, 21 candidates have passed a modest qualification threshold for the July debates, either hitting 1 percent in three qualifying polls or getting 65,000 donors. That\u2019s one more candidate than the Democratic National Committee has said it will allow on stage across the two nights, meaning someone has to get cut. Fourteen candidates have met both the basic qualification and a secondary one for the debates, leaving seven to fight for the final spots: John Delaney, John Hickenlooper, Tim Ryan, Michael Bennet, Steve Bullock, Bill de Blasio and Eric Swalwell. Senator Kamala Harris\u2019s presidential campaign announced her campaign raised $12m in the second quarter, which places her behind three other candidates who announced their fundraising amounts earlier this week. Mayor Pete tops the list, with $24.8m; followed by Joe Biden, with $21.5m and Bernie Sanders, with $18m. At least $2m of Harris\u2019s funds came in after the Democratic debates. Her campaign said 63,277 donations were made to the campaign in the first 24 hours after the debate. The Trump administration will continue to fight to add a citizenship question to the US Census, something the president has said repeatedly since the Commerce department announced on Tuesday that the questionnaire was being printed without the question. Justice department attorneys, who also told a judge on Tuesday that the fight for the question was being dropped, said on Friday that the Trump administration will continue its legal battle to include the question. A federal judge set a 2pm today deadline for the Justice department to explain what exactly what was happening with the case given the conflicting statements from the president and federal agencies. \u201cAs the government explained during the July 3, 2019 status conference and as noted above, the Departments of Commerce and Justice have been instructed to examine whether there is a path forward, consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, that would allow for the inclusion of the citizenship question on the census,\u201d the Justice Department said in a court filing Friday. Last week, the supreme court declined to make a decision about whether it was constitutional to include a question about citizenship, which sent the case back to the lower court where it is now being argued. Earlier today, Trump told reporters he was considering an executive order, among \u201cfour or five\u201d potential legal routes to getting the question on the Census. More alarming reports about US Customs and Border Patrol, which oversees enforcement of US borders. A border patrol agent raised concerns with a supervisor that other agents attempted to humiliate a Honduran migrant in May by making him hold a sign that read \u201cI like men,\u201d according to a CNN article published yesterday. CBP said they were looking into the allegations in response to the CNN report. CNN said: \u201cThe incident is one of many, per the emails, in which the CBP agent allegedly witnessed several colleagues displaying poor behavior and management\u2019s failure to act.\u201d Would you like a quick review of some recent pieces assessing Elizabeth Warren\u2019s economic positions? Well, you\u2019re in luck. Because Warren\u2019s campaign is emphasizing policies early in the campaign, there is a lot of thoughtful analysis of her economic position. Can Elizabeth Warren build a bigger welfare state without taxing the middle class? Vox looks closely at how Warren\u2019s ambitious domestic spending plan would actually work in a country like the US - while also referencing broader plans by other Democratic 2020 hopefuls. Even though progressives might say they want health care and university akin to the systems in Nordic countries, the US population and tax structure is very different. The Ivory Tower team of wonks behind Warren\u2019s policy agenda This Politico piece looks at the team of intellectuals helping formulate and deliver her policies. There\u2019s a fascinating/alarming quote in there from Austan Goolsbee, a senior economic adviser to Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign, who is still worried about how being prepared could negatively impact someone\u2019s chances on the campaign trail. \u201cDemocrats brought a stack of fact sheets to a gunfight,\u201d Goolsbee said of the 2016 campaign. While he admires the Warren team\u2019s policy chops, he added that \u201cit does give me a little heartburn when there\u2019s so much policy detail this early in the campaign.\u201d Warren Is No Hillary. She\u2019s Also No Bernie And over at Jacobin, there\u2019s a properly socialist take on Warren v Sanders. Really thoughtful, critical analysis in how the division between the two friends is playing out in more mainstream media. With Warren\u2019s advocacy for aggressive government regulation, her support for redistributive programs, her sharp critique of antisocial corporate behavior, and her rejection of individualistic folklore (remember \u201cYou didn\u2019t build that\u201d?), she\u2019s emerged as a relatively mild but nevertheless quite serious opponent of neoliberal ideology \u2014 the worldview in which markets can solve everything and, in Margaret Thatcher\u2019s words, \u201cThere is no such thing as society.\u201d In an essay for Essence magazine, Elizabeth Warren outlined a plan for executive orders to curb the race and pay gaps. \u201cWe need to demand that companies and the government properly value the work of Black women \u2014 and hold them accountable if they don\u2019t,\u201d she wrote. Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden hit out at the Democratic party\u2019s left wing in an interview broadcast on Friday with CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo. \u201cIt\u2019s centre-left, that\u2019s where I am,\u201d he said of the Democratic party. Trump is still trying to force including a citizenship question in the 2020 Census. Donald Trump told reporters he is \u201cthinking of\u201d issuing an executive order to force including a question about citizenship on the 2020 Census, according to the White House pool. Speaking to reporters outside the White House this morning, Donald Trump said the Fourth of July celebration in Washington DC was \u201cfantastic\u201d and would lead to more people joining the US military. He said the teleprompter went out before his speech ended, possibly because of the rain, which still doesn\u2019t explain why he made references to air travel during the Revolutionary War. He also responded to Joe Biden\u2019s comment that Trump is a bully, by saying \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m a bully at all.\u201d It is a surprising defense, especially considering there is a Wikipedia page listing more than 100 names Trump has called world leaders, reporters and organizations (i.e. \u2018Fake Tears Chuck Schumer,\u2019 \u2018Failed prognosticator Bill Kristol\u2019 and \u2018Al Frankenstein.\u2019) Vice president Mike Pence notes on Twitter that Venezuela declared its independence on this day 208 years ago. He used the anniversary as an opportunity to highlight the US government\u2019s support of opposition leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3. Nicol\u00e1s Maduro remains president of Venezuela, though Guaid\u00f3 declared himself interim president on 23 January. The country is racked by hyper-inflation, food and medicine shortages and collapsing infrastructure. Yesterday, the UN published a report accusing Maduro\u2019s security forces of committing a series of \u201cgross violations\u201d against Venezuelan dissenters and urges him to disband a notorious special forces group blamed for a wave of politically-motivated killings. Despite the US government\u2019s full-throated support for Guaid\u00f3, the country has actually done very little in the way of typical diplomatic response by providing minimal help to Venezuelan refugees, asylum-seekers and migrants fleeing the country. More from the White House pool on Trump\u2019s Census comments, which he made less than three hours before government lawyers explain their position on the case to a judge in Maryland at 2pm. We\u2019ll see what happens. We could also add an addition on. So we could start the printing now and maybe do an addendum after we get a positive decision. So we\u2019re working on a lot of things including an executive order. Trump said he spoke with attorney general William Barr, who said: \u201cwe have a number of avenues we could use..., all or one.\u201d Division on display A scuffle broke out when far left protesters burned the Stars and Stripes near the White House after the controversial presidential speech and military display on the National Mall on Independence Day. Some footage was captured for USA Today by Max Cohen, and posted to Twitter. While Trump celebrated the story of America as \u201cthe greatest political journey in human history\u201d while supporters cheered his promotion of the military, protesters assailed him for putting himself center stage on a holiday devoted to unity. And the US Secret Service said two people were arrested during the flag-burning incident on Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House, the Associated Press reports. The arrests were made about two hours before the president spoke at the Lincoln Memorial. The Secret Service said one person was arrested for felony assault on a police officer and malicious burning. The other was arrested for hindering a police investigation and resisting arrest. Neither individual was identified. It is not illegal to burn a US flag, but the Secret Service said the burning occurred beyond the limits of a permit issued by the National Park Service for the July 4th events. Donald Trump told reporters he is \u201cthinking of\u201d issuing an executive order to force including a question about citizenship on the 2020 Census, according to the White House pool. Four days ago, the department that oversees the Census, the Commerce department, said it was printing Census forms without the question. Chaos ensued. The president said reports that this was happening were fake - even though the Commerce secretary said it was happening - and then a Justice department lawyer had to defend the president\u2019s comment without anyone in the department apparently being briefed on it. The judge presiding over the case of whether its legal to include a citizenship question in the Census is not happy about how things are playing out. On Wednesday, just before the Fourth of July holiday, federal district court judge George Hazel convened a call with the attorneys and said: If you were Facebook and an attorney for Facebook told me one thing, and then I read a press release from Mark Zuckerberg telling me something else, I would be demanding that Mark Zuckerberg appear in court with you the next time, because I would be saying I don\u2019t think you speak for your client anymore. At 2pm today, the government is scheduled to appear in court to explain its next steps in the case. Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden hit out at the Democratic party\u2019s left wing in an interview broadcast on Friday with CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo. \u201cIt\u2019s centre-left, that\u2019s where I am,\u201d he said of the Democratic party. \u201cI think Ocasio-Cortez is a brilliant, bright woman, but she won a primary,\u201d said Biden. \u201cIn the general election fights, who won? Mainstream Democrats who are very progressive on social issues and very strong on education and healthcare.\u201d Yesterday, Donald Trump promised \u201cvery soon, we will plant the American flag on Mars.\u201d There has been no planted flag - that we know of - on Mars, but there have been a lot of American spacecraft: Senator Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 presidential hopeful, wrote an essay explaining how her presidency would support black women for the black women\u2019s magazine, Essence. The essay, which was published today, highlights research showing black women are more likely to be breadwinners for their families and work more than any other group of women workers, but are paid less and have worse access to housing, childcare and healthcare. Warren said on day one of her presidency, she would use executive orders to boost wages for women of color and open up new routes for leadership: I\u2019ll start by putting tough new rules on companies that contract with the government \u2014 who collectively employ a quarter of the American workforce. Companies with a bad track record on equal pay and diversity in management won\u2019t get new contracts \u2014 which gives them a big financial incentive to shape up. I will prohibit companies that want to get government contracts from forcing employees to sign away their rights with forced arbitration clauses and non-compete agreements \u2014 restrictions that are particularly hurtful to women of color.I will also take executive action to make the senior ranks of the federal government look like America and strengthen enforcement against systemic discrimination. We need to demand that companies and the government properly value the work of Black women \u2014 and hold them accountable if they don\u2019t. Warren is one of five presidential candidates scheduled to speak at the magazine\u2019s annual event, Essence Festival, this weekend. She, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Beto O\u2019Rourke are scheduled to speak on Saturday. Pete Buttigieg is scheduled to speak Sunday. Last year, more than 510,000 attended the four-day event. In April, Essence published an op-ed by Warren about her plan for improving maternal mortality for black and brown mothers. Black women are three to four times more likely than white women to die from pregnancy related causes. Good news in today\u2019s jobs report, which showed job growth rebounding after an unusual slowdown in hiring in May. There is evidence in the June report that the economy is slowing, sharply, which could encourage the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in July. Unemployment is still low at 3.7%. If you woke up wondering why so many people are talking about the fact that airplanes didn\u2019t exist in 1775, it\u2019s because of Donald Trump. He claimed that the Revolutionary army \u201ctook over airports\u201d that year in his Fourth of July speech yesterday commemorating the US\u2019s fight for independence. The Guardian\u2019s Washington bureau chief, David Smith, has the full review of the July 4th spectacle here. At the event, Smith writes: \u201cTrump did not fulfil his critics\u2019 worst fears of a politically partisan, campaign-style rally with his \u201cSalute to America\u201d event.\u201d That said, Trump is facing criticism this morning for making himself the center of Independence Day in a sprawling 45-minute speech. We\u2019ll have more reaction to that in the live blog today as well as more on the 2020 candidates, who are campaigning in full force this holiday weekend.",

      "bodyText": "Josh Frydenberg has defended a decision when he was environment minister to query whether he had the power to water down federal protections for critically endangered grasslands, and establish if any change had to be published, saying he was just investigating the process. The Senate this week passed a Greens motion forcing the government to explain the conduct of two of its senior ministers \u2013 Angus Taylor and Frydenberg \u2013 in relation to critically endangered grasslands at the centre of an investigation involving companies part-owned by Taylor. In an interview with Guardian Australia, Frydenberg said he made inquiries after Taylor sought a meeting with his office about the grasslands issue. \u201cWe wanted to understand the process for that particular issue, bearing in mind it was upgraded to critically endangered,\u201d he said. \u201cA meeting was sought by Angus to understand the technical aspects of the listing process and, as the local member, that\u2019s absolutely within his rights to do so.

One of the directors of that company is Richard Taylor, the minister\u2019s brother, and the minister himself holds an interest in the firm via his family investment company, Gufee. Emails obtained by Guardian Australia showed that Frydenberg\u2019s office raised the grasslands protection with the Department of the Environment and Energy on 8 March, a day after officials from the same department met Jam Land to discuss potential contraventions of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. An investigator from the unit that examines breaches under national environment law was also present at the meeting with Taylor and Frydenberg\u2019s office on 20 March 2017.
